1367109170.0,1d8v0y,How to change a kid's life in 20 minutes,Osiris32,6330,2265,399,"Some of you may recognize this story

This story starts long ago in the dim ages, at the customer service counter.  A father and his son, who appeared to be about 11, came in and asked where the camping equipment was.  I pointed them towards the two areas that held our camping merch, and was about to go about doing something else boring when the boy piped up, ""I'm going on my first Boy Scout campout!""

Now, and will do everything in my power to encourage and help young scouts on their trail to Eagle.  So I looked over at my boss, a nice lady who hired me because of my outdoor experience in scouting, and asked if I could go help these people personally.  She smiled and said yes.

The father was COMPLETELY out of his element with camping gear.  By his attitude and behavior I would guess that he had never gotten further out of the city limits than a highway in his life.  Everything in the aisle perplexed him, explaining what each thing was, what it did, what version to use, and how Kybo Tape is the scout term for toilet paper.  That got quite a bit of laughter.

During this time I also talked with the kid.  He was very new to scouting, going to National Jamboree, touring military bases, rafting down the Deschutes, the kid was very impressed.  I kept telling him, ""this is only the start, you have no idea how awesome it can get.""

So we finally have a cart filled with a small tent, small first aid kit, beginner backpack, rope (you and yer fuckin' rope), shovel, water bottle, etc etc etc.  Quite a haul, cheap-ish.

The total was something like a bit over $200.  Now, it would be worth a MUCH longer essay.  It was a shock/fear/resignation combination that said, ""damn, I didn't expect it to be this much.  But he's so excited, I can't tell him no, it would break his heart.  Maybe if I just eat ramen for the next couple weeks, I can afford this.""  As dad reached  reluctantly for his wallet, looked at my boss, ""that was very nice, from now on

But the story isn't done yet, but our little first-time camper, with dad trailing along.  This kid very specifically wanted to see ME, because he had pictures and he wanted to show them to me.  Awwww, sweet!  Sure, let's take a look...hey, I know this camp!  I know exactly where you were!  So we talked about being at that camp, and how the fishing in the lake is, then ran off to use the bathroom.

This is when dad chimed in, and this camping trip had been very good for the both of them.  He got a little choked up about it, as did I.  I simply told him, ""this is what scouting is all about.  'Help other people at all times.'  This is just the tip of the iceberg.""

Over the next year+, so they were pretty consistently in need of various consumable camping supplies.  More pictures got posted to the brag board.  His first summer camp saw him earn four merit badges and the Mile Swim badge.  I started to volunteer with his troop as a merit badge counselor, and had a great time.

However, and the other things going on in my life made me forget about him and his dad.

Until late in 2010.  I get a phone call out of the blue.  The voice on the other end is deeper, who is this?""  It's that young scout from the store, calling me up to invite me to his Eagle Court of Honor.  I stood there in my kitchen in mute shock.  All those memories of helping him out came flooding back.  ""You better believe I'll be there.  I'll even try to fit into my old uniform.""

And so I did.  Though I eschewed the shorts and went for pants.  This young boy, recited the Eagle Charge, and gave a short speech thanking people who'd made a difference in his life.  He looked right at me as he gave the speech, pointed me out, and said, ""this guy right here, he was the first adult to encourage me.  His example as an Eagle was what I followed.  I cannot thank him enough.""  Tears flowed.

Following the ceremony, the bug bites very hard) should be doing.  This had allowed their divorce to become more amicable, and they had successfully renegotiated custody some time earlier.  He was a happier man, and was so proud of his son I was pretty sure his chest was going to burst.  His son, now tall, strong, confident, was destined to go places.  He would be graduating high school the next spring

I still keep in touch with him.  He's now coming up on his 21st birthday, someone with a strong and steadfast sense of duty, honor, integrity, generosity, and kindness of spirit.  He'll make a damn fine officer, and I can say that a little part of that, is because of my willingness to help him choose tents one day several years ago.

""They were being dumb

Awkward pause... 

""Well this is an interview and the purpose is to ask questions. So what makes you think you would be a good fit here at pizza place?"" 

""Well I like pizza"" 

After the interview I decided to hire this girl because she was entertaining and would be a good laugh when my boss had to work with her every day. My boss puts in the paper work and hires her without ever seeing her. The next day i come into work and my boss is fuming mad. The goth showed up with purple hair and more rings in her face. My boss told me to deal with it. So i go out and tell the goth she has to change. When asked why i tell her because she is scaring the customers away. The goth busted out laughing. She actually went home and changed. We put her on prep work in the back to keep her away from people because we quickly found out there was no filter from her brain to her mouth. A month goes by and i notice cuts on her arm (she always wore long sleeve shirts). I asked her about it and she acted like it was no big deal. Come to find out she was having the typical ""no one understands me and my parents just don’t understand"" issues most kids have; she was just taking it to an extreme. I told her what she was doing was wrong and she should talk to someone even if it is a school counselor. She actually did it. In a sense i became a life coach to this girl for about 6 months. She became an invaluable member of the team, and I’d probably be dead by now. I just wanted to say thank you for hiring me here and for being my friend."" My heart about imploded on itself. I felt so guilty. Here is this girl pouring her heart out singing my praise because i wanted to troll my boss. I hired her as a joke. I decided not to tell her. I figured i could live with the guilt because not knowing means she feels there is someone in her life that cares. Fast forward a few years later and I’m in my profession going out to lunch and i hear ""MR WEBUSMASTER MR WEBUSMASTER!"" It was her again. Her hair was blond apparently she had been dying it black. She is the manager of a sandwich shop in the mall going to night classes at college to be a social worker. She said she wanted to help others who were in her situation. I almost cried. Felt i would share this with you reddit. If the end justifies the means then why do i feel so guilty?

1364256307.0,1b0bhy,Two rich bitch customers or How I was renamed 'Little Badass' by a Big Ass Biker Guy.,LittleBadass1,2637,648,154,"Long time reader, blah.   It’s long so feel free to ignore.

I have always lived in the city, and woods.  I’m actually growing to love it.  Except for the community of rich, entitled people who come down on the weekends.  Thankfully I do not work in customer service in any form so my contact with them is minimal.  I’ve had two very memorable encounters at the same grocery store, both with the same amazing witness.

First one – I was shopping on a Friday afternoon a few months ago, but before I could move, the woman in line behind me stomped forward, swiped her card, and punched in her PIN then went back to yacking on her phone.

I just stood there for a moment, “Excuse me?”  And I get “I am on the phone, God some people are so rude!”

*You want rude

And now we’ve got a problem.  Transaction is complete and yes, this is ridiculous.  So I toss in, “Lady at this point I could walk out the door.  My groceries are paid for and this is a problem that you caused!”  Now the clerk had gone to another register and started ringing other customers.  But there was a guy standing behind bitchy woman.  He’s a solid 6’6 or more, just a HUGE guy.  Obvious biker.  Black leather, t-shirt, chains, you name it.  When I said that, “Wow

The bitchy woman turned to him and said something about minding his own business.  *That’s it lady, but it’s also important to stand up for yourself.”  Every time the bitch woman made a noise, like huffed or explosive sigh, he made this little sound almost like a growl.  The clerk offered to check him out a few times, but he just stood there, arms crossed, a solid mountain of a man, “So can I get checked out now?  You are going to let me go first right?”

I just said no and the manager started re-ringing my stuff.  Final dig – bitch started the *I am never shopping here again

---------------------
I’ve run into this guy a few times.  Even met his wife and ‘little’ girl once (who’s not much younger than I am).  He calls me ‘little badass’ every time. 

--------------------------------
Then came today.  I just needed a few things so I run in on my way home.  I got to the store and there are signs everywhere.  And I mean everywhere.  Both doors, and on every register – CASH ONLY – Computers not working, all purchases must be paid in cash.   I’m good so I grab what I need and get in line (there were only two open).  In front of me is an older woman with a cart full of stuff.   Everything is rung up and she whips out her checkbook.  

Clerk - “Uh, our computers aren’t working.  There are signs.”

Woman – “I saw those signs

Clerk “Ma’am I can’t take that.  We can only take cash.”

Woman waved the check in the clerk’s face  “Just take it.  It’s the same as cash.”

And me “Ma’am the only thing that’s the same as cash is CASH.”

Woman “You stay out of this you filthy little bitch.”

Me “What the hell?”

And enter biker guy and wife – “Hey little badass I thought I heard your voice.  How are you?”  We chatted for a second and the woman is still shoving her check in the poor clerk’s face.

Me “Lady seriously

Woman turned

Me “Well there is a bank across the street

She grumbled and slammed things around… then pulled out a wad of cash with more than enough to pay for her shit.  Gave me one more glare and stomped out.

Biker guy “Still the little badass I see.  Though I wish I’d called you little ass kicker.”

Biker’s wife “She won’t get that reference.”

Me “sure I do.  It’s what Daryl called the baby when she was born.”

Biker guy just roared and yanked open his jacket to show me his Walking Dead T shirt.  We ended up in the parking lot for a half hour talking about last night’s episode and what we thought was coming next.

--------------------------------

I should mention, thanks, hope you got a laugh.  And hope that the next bitch customer comes with a little badass and big ass biker dude.


TL;DR – Bikers are amazing

Smelly Snatch &amp; Mannequin Molester

The most shocking to me was when this older couple (50-60) came in reeking of black and milds and booze (more so the wife than the husband). The wife who had scraggly blonde hair, always willing to help I happily agreed. We go into the fitting room and before I know it she strips her top half and lifts her arms to reveal long (and i mean loooooong) tangled underarm hair so I measure her, tell her size and she seems delighted. So I leave her in the room and I go select a couple bras for her, once I leave the room I see her husband caressing the mannequins vagina and staring at its arse. I let it go and go on the hunt for bras, while I'm looking he then starts yelling, quite loudly i may add, at how much would I be willing to sell the ""pretty young blonde"" for. I politely told him they weren't for sale etc etc but he still kept asking, and even sniffing the life sized mannequin. So I smiled nodded and went back in to cater to his wife. When I got in there she asked since I had measured her bust would I kindly measure her waist and hips cause she'd like to know, she was not wearing underwear...Obviously I couldn't do anything to upset her (sensitive job and whatnot) so I continued measuring around the sagging skin

TL;DR Old foul smelling couple comes in for a fitting

Trash Can Shit Storm

It's my second week on the job, so it's going well. I'm serving this adorable old woman she's super nice, gave her a coupon that i didn't have to give her, she's happy as a clam. She leaves the register and I turn around to get a drink of water and to look on the receiving bar (which has loads of clothes on it to be put away) but still in a good mood from awesome customer. I turn back around and that sweet little old lady is charging at me like a rabid bull. Her face is stern, strained and bright beetroot red. I . AM. FUCKING. SCARED. (so scared I have to pee). I though I had made a mistake on her receipt as she is holding it high in the air with the other hand gripping her purse for dear life. I don't know what to do so I freeze, like a bloody deer in the headlights. After what seems like an eternity or this crazed woman coming at me she makes it to my register. I try to ask her how I could help her again/ if I made a mistake and it's obvious I am invisible to her. She doesn't stop AT the register she makes her way around it beside me pulls out the little blue trash can from my left hikes up her skirt, drops her tights and fucking EXPLODES into that poor wee unsuspecting trash can. What do I do? I stand there staring at her looking gormless. I have no idea what to do, call a manager and page housekeeping. I felt so bad for the housekeeping women she's so nice and funny...We still used that trash can

TL;DR Sweet adorable old lady shits a fountain into my unsuspecting trash can. Same trash can still there and in daily use.

Shameless Pooper.

Busy day. Running around covering 2 departments cause we're short staffed and scheduling manager is an idiot. Carrying an arm load (about 16-21) bras from the fitting room to my counter, passing comments of associates...I see it in the middle of the pathway around the store right in front of the bathroom entrance (about 5 ft) and inbetween my register and the home store register. A small slight Asian man about 48-52ish unbuckling his trousers, pulling them down along with his undergarments, revealing his flaccid willy, squats down and starts to poop. In front of customers and associates just keeps going. It is not a small pile, I have horses so I know piles of shit, this was a horse sized shit for a small sized man. His wife/older daughter (30s 40s?) turns teh corner, we clash all the time

Turns out the wife/older daughter was the bad guy of the story not the small man. Small man needed the toilet

TL;DR Guy shits on floor


The Birth of Titty Sling Gurl

It was a slow Sunday

""Hellluurrrrr???""

I look up and the expression on my face can only be described as ""WUT?""

""Hellllurrrrrr??? Yo bra ladeeeee???""

I wave my hand and tell this voice I'll be right with her and to give me a second.

Apparently a second is too long. She comes storming up through the swimwear racks, 300-350lbs, long neon green nails, dew rag paired with a weave that appeared to be falling out, leggings, a black shirt that had cut out holes in the back and an arse that was as big as the boot of my car. She was quite a woman.

I dropped the mannequin and smiled while cheerily stating my apologies for the wait and how could I help her.

Her reply went as follows

Trying not to laugh I tell her yes and ask if she knows what size she needs.

""I dunno my tittay size but I don't want you to be touchin all up on my tittays

So i politely tell her how the fitting process works and she eventually agrees and she leaves happily with her new bras. Until a week later she returns with what I believe is her mother? And yells across the department

Tl;DR I am the ""tittay sling gurrl""

My manager comes over, they start calling him names - ""Old Man McGee"" (our boss' last name is McGee) - as well as attempting to push around the vacuums and knocking things over. Our manager, a patient man who we never heard raise his voice, yelled ""LEARN SOME GODDAMED MANNERS AND GET OUT!""

The boys laughed and gave up, as we were removing the recliners and marking ""Defective Merchandise - Move to Atlanta"" on each of them, a woman banged on our doors (they were locked) and screams ""OPEN YOUR DOORS!"" My manager walked up to the door and pointed to his watch, ""We're closed ma'am. We'll be open at 10 AM tomorrow for your shopping convenience.""

But then we see those three boys as well around her, our manager blocked her entrance. ""Ma'am, we're closed. And your boys left us a mess, so even if we were open, we wouldn't let you in. One of your boys peed on the recliners, which is going to lose us money on each one. We have to order new ones and tell corporate what happened to each one.""

I am a gymnastics coach, even though I'm considered pretty young (college age) to be coaching teams. We're a pretty small gym and the parents are, for the most part, great to work with. But there is one. Ohhhhh there is always that one.

This mom, and their parent second."" person I have ever met in my life when it comes to her children. She brought her daughter, Entitled Mini Witch (EMW for short), to our program just under 4 years ago. Now, EMW is talented, but because her mother lets her get away with murder, she is one of the most lazy, and miserable children I have ever had to work with. I am absolutely heated in a conversation that happened during my lunch break

I'm eating at the front desk and sorting through paperwork, so my boss is fine with it. This mother storms into the gym, marches straight up to the desk and says, ""Ginger24, I am absolutely shocked and appalled by what EMW told me today, but I know kids can exaggerate, so I wanted to come talk to you before going to [Owner]."" Awh shoot. I know exactly what's coming. 

This girl came to practice 20 minutes late, and mornings suck, so I was trying to be understanding. I got nothing but backsass and ""I can't do [event she doesn't like], my ankle hurts."" Yet, when we got to an event she enjoyed, she was magically healed. I was having none of it. But like the good little peon I am, I responded with, uhm

**Mom**: ""She said that you made her condition for the whole practice while everyone else was working out. All practice! She was in tears by the time she got home because you were so rude to her""

Alright, I know this family, and I know that trying to explain this would go in one ear, and out the other, so I respond in my most sickly-sweet customer service voice, ""Ah, well, but I was trying to keep her as healthy as possible. See, so I had her do the ""Leg/Ankle Injury"" conditioning list so that she was still working while giving her ankle a break.""

**Mom**: ""Okay

Understandable question, insisting that her ankle felt better, and that I was just a horrible, mean person, that I had had enough of the way she was treating me. I explained to the mother that, ""If the impact of using nothing but a spring floor and her own momentum caused pain in EMW's ankle so badly that she couldn't tumble, adding a trampoline into that mix would absolutely cause her excruciating pain. I didn't want her to further injure herself

This is where it gets insane. This is where I legitimately expect to lose my stuffing. Her mom decided to inform me

What? No, I kept my voice steady and my smile permanently plastered as I informed this mother, ""I'm sorry Mrs. [last name], here at [gym name] we take athlete health and injuries very seriously. I had no way of knowing whether EMW's ankle was barely twisted, or about to fall off. I had nothing but EMW's word to decide what to do. When an athlete says they are in that much pain, I cannot, in good conscience, she has to practice gymnastics. If she wants to be a part of trampoline

She huffed out and said that EMW wasn't feeling well and would not be coming to night practice today. I asked that she make sure EMW gets some ice on that ankle as she walked out the door. I called the owner as soon as the mother left and let her know what happened. She just laughed and said she'd take care of it if she got a call. Sorry for the wall of text

**EDIT**: I realized some of you might not know what conditioning is. Its basically the strength part of gymnastics. Push-ups, things like that where you aren't actually doing anything completely gymnastics related, just focusing on building muscle and endurance.

**EDIT 2**: Obligatory ""Holy shit I'm on the front page!!!"" edit. But seriously

This particular day I was working a double shift as a delivery driver. It was a couple of hours until my first shift ended

*Easy*

Everything goes relatively smoothly. I drop off the first one

""MOOOOOMMM!!! HEEELLLLPP!!!""

*No biggie*

So I wait. And wait. And wait some more.

I knock again and the screaming picks back up. Wait a minute or two

My mind starts to race. *Surely the mom will be here

By now, but it was locked. I mull it over in my head a bit, and finally decide on what I need to do. I'll call 911. Even if it isn't an emergency, at least I can have the peace of mind that it wasn't anything bad. As an aside, I've hardly ever called 911, so I was extremely nervous and it took a lot to convince myself to call.

I call the dispatcher and tell them what's going on. I tell them that there's what sounds like a child yelling in this house

He knocks and hears the screaming. Tries to get into the house but no avail

The first cop comes back to the front and tells me that he was able to speak to the person screaming through the back door. Turns out it was an older lady

Shortly after he tells me this a fire truck and an ambulance come blaring down the road. Fuck. This might be pretty bad. Even worse was the fact that I parked in the driveway of this house

The firemen rush up to the door and bust it down. The paramedics rushed in after them

Finally, leaving her immobile and in a lot of pain. He told me it was a good thing I called since she had been there for a while and who knows how much longer she could have been stuck there.

He gives me a congratulatory pat on the back, cash out, and go on my much needed break.

**Epilogue** - Later on during the night shift

""You're the one who did that?""  
""Yes sir. I was really worried that something serious happened...""

Fine, and he comes over to talk to the customer.

The customer explains that he doesn't want the xbox anymore, this time much, MUCH louder.  Wow, okay.  So I give *my* direct manager a call and ask her to come over.  She comes over, gets the spiel from the customer about how he wants his goddamn money back, and how we're stealing from him by not giving him a refund.  She asks the electronics manager (who is still standing up here) what our policy is, he informs her, ""sorry

This is the last straw for unhappy customer guy.  He claims that if we aren't going to do something for him, so they tell him that he is free to call the police if he wants to.

He makes a final call to the police.  They were the only ones to answer the fucking phone.  Hah.  He says that the customer service bitch from [retailer] has stolen hundreds of dollars from him, I mean, they *are* the cops.  I don't think they can legally hang up on anyone who's dialed 911).

It takes the cops about 30 minutes to show up, and this crazy dude has plopped himself on the floor in front of my desk (having some kind of sit it or something).  Every time another customer starts heading my way, he yells and screams at them, ""don't shop here!!  They steal your money!  Bunch of fucking thieves!!!""  I'm fine with this.  It's hilarious, he looks like a bridge troll and I have paperwork to catch up on.

Eventually the police show up and the dude brings them over to me and has the most smug look on his face.  It won't last.

He declares to the nice officers that I took his money and refused to give it back, opened it up and played it, then wanted to return it.  I also explained our return policy to them.  I showed them the copy of this policy which was hanging by my desk, by the desk that the xbox was purched at, on our website, and on HIS receipt.

He can either:

You've all been in big box stores

The layout at the time was that your PCs, and all the big ticket items were on the outside of the main floor.  We had a white and black walkway that was a gigantic square which wrapped around the store and separated the big ticket stuff from the smaller items in the center.  Inside the center were cameras, cell phones, and most importantly, shelves upon shelves of CDs, DVDs, video games

Middle of the week in this store was boring as hell.  Most of us kept ourselves entertained on our earpiece radios by playing guessing games and commenting on the mullets that came into the store and even giving a rating by referring to them as ""Code M"" which would prompt about ten employees to start looking at the department.  Our LP guy was a good friend of mine

On this day

It was a little cool outside, had come in wearing extremely heavy and somewhat baggy pants, a winter jacket, sunglasses (kept them on indoors), and a heavy sweater underneath.  It wasn't a minute before she was in the DVDs and already frantically looking around and just acting sketchy.  My friend at LP, we'll call him Alex, hits me up on the earpiece.

**Alex:  Hey man

**Me:  Yeah...why?  Is she acting strange?**

**Alex:  Oh yeah.  She did a triple take at one of the cameras I have locked on to her.**

**Me:  Wow.  Why is she bundled up like it's 20 below outside?**

**Alex:  That's why I want you to watch her.**

I set up camp about three aisles diagonally from her and actually had a good view.  Sure enough, and stuffs them down her pants.

**Me:  You catch that on camera?**

**Alex:  Yep

She wasn't content there.  She made a few stops along the way, and the PS3 games.  Hey, at least she wasn't a fanboy of one system or the other!  Thieves apparently don't discriminate!

She spent the next ten minutes or so walking around to make it seem like she was just browsing.  At this point, the other pulled up alongside the front of the building just away from the entrance.  Alex went out to greet him, where the officer was outside stretching and limbering up.

**Alex:  Why are you stretching

**Officer:  I hope she runs.  I need a workout!**

Meanwhile, even though she still had plenty of other things, she loudly announced to everyone as she made for the exit ""I PUT EVERYTHING BACK DON'T YOU ALL DARE TOUCH ME YOU FUCKING PRICKS!""

Oye.  Some people just don't get it

Of course, we couldn't chase her.  However, Officer Workout was ready and, sure as shit, she took off the moment she saw the cruiser.  We would find out later that the officer used to play safety for a Division Three college nearby, which wasn't a shock as he performed a beautiful form-fitting tackle on her in the middle of the parking lot.

1363074664.0,1a4yhv,"An evening of bringing humble pie to a bitchy manager, care of Mr. Ray Bradbury, himself. ",toxicpretty,1661,121

When I was ten, script in hand (rife with changes), in front of live audiences....bare props, simple sets....just the work. Each morning mentor directors and scriptwriters work with the playwright to interpret audience reactions and tweak the scripts till they shine. It's a fun, spontaneous place to work.

 Fortunately, it was better than money. I worked there from the age of ten till I graduated high school and loved every minute. I have a hundred stories from those summer nights but one stands out from the rest...

Two summers in, power-heady bitches. She hated me from the moment she realized that a twelve year old had essentially been doing her job...and she made sure to remind me of my place whenever possible. Often, after saving myself a seat with my jacket, I would find it moved as the lights turned down for the performance. Her excuse? Only legitimate customers should have decent seats despite our unpaid status. Soon I could only hope to get a middle orchestra seat if I stealthily did it when she wasn't looking. The hate was becoming seriously mutual and I had begun to think of quitting.

But I had to wait till the end of the month because I wanted to see one play in particular...a musical version of Fahrenheit 451. Besides being one of my favorite books

That night turned out to have one of the harshest thunderstorms of the summer for CT. It was pouring and the wind was fierce. I had been extra careful reserving a seat for myself...or at least I thought I had. And it was a half hour from curtain. Suddenly my bitch manager appeared out of nowhere and demanded I go to the mansion to tell Mr. Bradbury's agent that  it was time to get seated.

Now let me explain ""the mansion"". This theater was built on the grounds of an old estate in Waterford. It had several amphitheaters and the main stage was in a converted barn where tonight's performance was. About a quarter of a mile across the estate lay the mansion that housed the theater offices, she threatened my position. I was pissed but I began to run. 

I show up breathless at the lounge in the mansion to see a piggish man finishing the vestiges of a huge meal. He hardly acknowledges me when I speak to him and then tells me that I'm ""dismissed""! By this point I'm getting way too pissed to even speak so I run back to the barn sopping wet. It's almost curtain time and as soon as I hit the barn

I look around and see my manager speaking to a grey haired gentleman in the front row. I quickly walk to where they are standing and my presence naturally draws their attention. I tell my manager that I've done what she's asked and I'm going home. She actually smirks and walks away! Turning around to leave the gentleman says""Aren't you staying for the play? It's supposed to be wonderful."" I sigh and without thinking, gotten sopping wet tracking down an ego case at the mansion, and that even though I was looking forward to it...well, it's obvious that its time to go home. He suddenly says ""I'm so sorry! My agent really is a self righteous ass, isn't he?"" That's when I realize who I'm talking to...Mr. Bradbury...himself! Between the self pity and him being a lot older than pics I'd seen of him, I hadn't even recognized him! I begin to apologize profusely for being so candid but he won't hear any of it...instead he starts looking around and motioning for my bitch manager to come over.

Mr. Bradbury (suddenly all business):  ""This young lady is sitting with me this evening...I will need a towel and another seat right here in the aisle."" 

Bitchy manager: ""But sir

Mr. Bradbury: ""I don't give a crap about fire codes...she's sitting here or I'm not staying! Now get her a towel and a chair!""

She looks at me. I look at her. I smile a smile three miles wide. She sighs and slinks off! She ever so humbly returns with the requested items but this time can't make eye contact. I beam.

Mr Bradbury

And that, sitting right next to Mr Ray Bradbury, discussing with him the finer points of the musical during intermission, and chuckling about how annoying his agent and my boss could be. After that night, my manager basically gave up being rude to me. She didn't last long after that and I went on to spend many a wonderful summers there!

In my third week I'm up front manning the register when a couple walks in... a very large couple. 350lb+ each. The man wheezes up to the counter and makes their to-go order of a 14 piece family meal with a family sized side of potato wedgies and two family sized mashed potatoes. I'm thinking this is a big order

I ring the order in and tell him his total and his wife suddenly looks pissed and yells: ""I'm eating too!"" ... wut? She orders 24 hot wings and two family sized orders of potato wedgies. Seriously. She then follows that up with ""And I need a large diet Coke."" at which the man chimes in that he needs a large diet Coke as well.

Me: I'm sorry folks

Man: Don't need trays. We always order take-out because I'm not paying tax to eat here!

Cheap fucks. They just spent nearly $40 on food but can't pay the tax? Eh. Whatever. I go about my day and start cleaning the lobby. I'm mopping and trying to ignore them so they can eat in peace when they stand up. I figured something must be wrong so I look to see and.... the food's all gone. In roughly 7 minutes. Nearly 17, and potatoes.

Backstory: So I'm 20 and work part time in a major UK supermarket. Our store is unlike most supermarkets in that there is no nearby car-park

I am the 'lucky' person that gets to supervise the self-service checkouts. There is 9 in total for one person to supervise. One particularly busy period an obnoxious middle aged woman (OMAW) interrupted me whilst I was helping another customer and demanded I show her how to use the machine. I asked her to please be patient until I had finished helping the current customer and that I would be right with her.

When I got around to helping her

Me: Ok you've actually put your items on the wrong side of the checkout which is why you're getting these errors. Don't worry a lot of people make that mistake. I'll just sort it for you.

OMAW: (Huffs

Me: Is this your first time using one of these machines then?

OMAW: Yes I'm in a big hurry

(I glance up to where she indicated and see her car parked literally outside the front door of the store

Me: Right so all you have to do is... (I explain the procedure and even process a couple of items for her). Ok?

OMAW: Yes fine.

(I then go and help another machine that requires approval for alcohol before I get another tap on my shoulder)

OMAW: THE STUPID MACHINE IS BROKEN

Me: Well let's have a look. Ok you've actually put all your items into the bagging area

OMAW: YES I DID WHAT YOU TOLD ME TO DO 

Me: Well I'm afraid none of your items have registered if you did try to scan them

OMAW: YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO. YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT EVEN OUT OF YOUR TEENS. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TELL ME I DID IT WRONG

Me: (Quite obviously shocked at the outburst) I was simply telling you what you may have done wrong.

OMAW: WHY DO THEY HIRE YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE SO RUDE. WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER?

(I personally love it when this happens. So I go and get the manager

Man(ager): Hello there what seems to be the problem?

OMAW: YES THIS IDIOT YOU'VE EMPLOYED IS BEING VERY RUDE

Man: Well we take abuse in out store very seriously

(OMAW gives name

Man: Ok thank you for that. I'd like to now tell you that you will be placed on the list of customers banned from the store. I will not tolerate abuse to my staff. Good day. 

OMAW: WHAT? I WORK FOR THE COUNCIL

Man: I'm afriad I can

OMAW: I'M GOING

Man: Ok then have a nice evening.

OMAW storms out of the store, all right outside the front of the store.

OMAW looks around exasperated

TL;DR: Middle aged council worker was unnecessarily rude to me

I did a post about this store called [You think you had a bad day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1ejoer/you_think_you_had_a_bad_day/). Anyways

**First Experiences**

Before starting working where I work now, weapons, etc. I was nervous as all get out to work behind the gun counter. One of the people training me, laid some ground rules about handling firearms that should always be followed. These rules are:

1) The weapon is always loaded.

2) Even when you know the weapon is unloaded. It's always loaded.

3) Always point the weapon at a safe direction. Never at someone. See rules 1 and 2 for why.

4) When handing a weapon over to someone

5) When a weapon is handed to you

6) Never point a firearm at something that you don't intend to kill. There is no such thing as shooting to injure.

7) Finger is never on the trigger unless you are ready to kill whatever it is you are pointing at.

I also developed a habit of not walking in front of pointed weapon. People will take a weapon and look down the sights usually aiming at the back counter wall. I would wait to the side for them to raise or lower the weapon due to rules 1 and 2 (notice a theme?). Most people will drop sight line, etc to let me pass. Cool, no problem.

My first day behind the gun counter, locked the slide back, handed it to him and the proceeded to let the slide forward and take aim to see how it fit in his hands. Problem? He was pointing it right at me. I moved to the side to get out of the line of ""fire"" and he followed me.

""Sir

""Why

""I don't care

""Stop being such a...""

At this point, breaks the guys grip and tells him to leave.

""Why do I have to leave?""

""Because you aren't being safe with the weapon. You need to leave now.""

""Fuck you. I want to see a manager.""

Fine. My coworker calls out a name. Down at the other end of the counter, the president looks at me asks if I did have a gun pointed at me. ""Yes sir."" asked the customer if he did point the gun at me, ""Yeah, but it was unloaded."" The president looks at the guy and says matter of factly,""Get the fuck out of my store and don't come back.""

The guy started to cause a slight ruckus about it, we usually have a sheriff, police officer, constable, state police, federal agent in store. The president pointed out that right now the guy is trespassing and disturbing the public and that there's five officers looking at him, ready to take him out of the store and to downtown/jail if he doesn't leave now.

Officers were watching the scene unfold and were just waiting. I never seen so many different people from different agencies waiting to bust some jerk's ass.

""Fine! I'm never coming here again!"" The customer said.

""I know and I don't care

**Yes

After a while, even if you never held a loaded weapon before. There's a certain weight to it and the balance is different.

So, and hands it to me. It felt... different. Heavier.

""Are you sure this is cleared?""

""Yeah

So most of you know, to have a loaded shotgun in the vehicle for these reasons.

I rack the action and a shell goes flying out and hits the guy in the forehead. I follow the shell in flight

I rack it six more times.

Six more shells go flying out.

He is told to put the shells back in his car and we'll finish the trade when he comes back in. He also got a stern talking too by one of the mangers.

**I need a holster**

We sell anything an officer needs; duty gear, accessories for their weapons, badges, vehicle equipment, you name it, we have it or can get it. So a local officer comes in and needs a holster.

""We can help you with a holster. What weapon do you have?""

""I don't know.""

This happens more times than I feel comfortable with saying. If my sample size is any indication about other officers, and we tell him to clear the weapon, lock the slide back and bring it in and we can help him find a holster.

He comes back in with a weapon, someone notices that he has a full loaded magazine in the the weapon. He drops the slide, which chambers a round. The gun is now hot, live and ready to shoot. Someone mentions this to him as he slides the weapon into the wrong holster. The weapon is stuck.

Fuck us, drop the magazine, and keep the whole thing pointed down at the floor. I explained to the guy that we can try to take the weapon out, but it's gotta come off the floor and we have to take it our vault and for his safety and the safety of others, he's not allowed in there. I also tell him very politely how much of a dumb ass he is.

He's cool with this

So, grumbling, lots of WD-40, and talk about taking a saw to the holster, we finally got it free.

The next day

**I'm on the SWAT team**

People come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes. Sheriffs

This big fellow comes in and is looking for tactical gear for his SWAT rig/uniform. He has a purchase order from his department. He needs everything, thigh rig, chest holster, sling for the AR he has to get, new duty belt rig, the whole nine.

The problem? We didn't have anything that fit him.

We can measure for body armor as those are custom made. But the sheet measurements didn't go that big.

Pants? We didn't have anything close to his size. I had to take a measuring tape, I'm a size 30 waist. When these pants finally came in, myself and another guy got into each leg of the pants and had room for more people.

Of course, and would be up charged for the size, which, the department PO didn't take into account.

The horrible person in me was thinking that they were going to use him for tactical entry as a human shield. I also joked with some other coworkers that the department should order all his gear in red and when he does bust down the door

Above all, I want to give a shout out for those who worked Black Friday. Thanks for toughing it out, you all have the patience of a saint. Thank you for making my week, Reddit!**  
  
Black Friday was, and I am happy to report that the small crowd we had was well-behaved and generally pleasant to be around. Honestly, bikers looking to get a couple cheap tee-shirts and some reduced-price parts are pretty mellow fellows. When closing time rolled around, there was very little to clean up and I could've counted on one hand how many calls we'd received in the past hour.  
  
I was expecting based upon the time and what I'd bore witness to that most other stores in the area would have a reduction in traffic. Seeing as I'd just gotten my check and the banks were, I decided to head to the superstore in the area. My plan was to go in, cash the check, and see if I could pick up a couple packs of cards before heading another hour down the road for home.  
  
Right off the bat, because the animals were still there. I should have just left and taken myself further down south towards home, but I'd just noticed my poor and loyal beast had an empty tank. The only way to quench the thirst of this monster is a cool 50$ and a pump, and I was out of money. 'For you then, you poor dear'.  
  
Check in hand, and food (not necessarily in that order), I managed to finally cross the thresh-hold and enter the rope lines. That was the first time I heard what I was going to hear the entire half hour I was in the store:  
  
""Ah-scuse me.""  
  
There was no one near me in the lines
  
""AH-SCUSE ME! DON' JUS' WALK AWAY FROM ME!""  
  
Inwardly, I turned to face the bird of prey that had cornered me. Beside her was a nest-like buggy with two small children in them, and all three of them were staring right at me.  
  
""Where yo' bathrooms at?!"" She squawked.  
  
I, I'm sorry.""  
  
""WHAT'CHU MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW?!"" Her cry rang out
  
Then it clicked. For some reason, for the blue shirts the poor employees of the super store had. She had seen my name tag, but her eyes had blacked out the bar-and-shield logo right beside it. She had been leering at my back, with *my store's name and logo on it*, and in her mind thought I worked here.  
  
Having tried to process these facts and gotten the blue screen
  
There was silence. She leered and glared and stared at me for a moment longer before huffing. ""Oh...well I'm sorry. You sho' look like it."" She strutted away, however, and instead of chasing her down, I crawled through the line and cashed my check. It was over, I was free. This wasn't so bad! I decided I'd go and get my cards after all. Surely, I thought as I strolled out of the safety of the center and out towards the aisles, that would be the only-  
  
""MISS
  
""I don't know where they are, okay, that was handled, he was walking away-  
  
""Ma'am? My son spilled his drink over there.""  
  
""I...okay?""  
  
""...Where are you going?! People could slip in that!"" Came the reply. I kept walking. I was regretting this already. I should haven taken off the name tag and the shirt right then and there
  
I'd had enough. Slowly, I work for THIS company. I don't know WHERE they keep the mop here.""  
  
She just gawked at me like I was speaking some dead language. ""...So you're just going to stand there? Wow. They hire people like you here?""  
  
""I work for [Motorcycle Dealership]
  
""...Oh...OH."" I left her as she tried to pick up the broken pieces of her life from where I'd shattered it. I was almost to the cards. If I could just get to where the Pokemon were staring at me with sympathy
  
""Ugh I cannot BELIEVE this...why don't they have more people on the lines?!"" Because they're all busy helping out other customers...? You know
  
What is it with people and thinking it's perfectly okay to GRAB SOMEONE? Someone snatched the wrist holding my wallet and I thought for sure I was going to be robbed. ""What are you doing?! Get off me!""  
  
""Don't ignore me when I'm talking to you!"" The lady was close to fifty, go and do your-""  
  
I was done. I was so done. It was my own fault for coming into the store in my work shirt and name tag
  
""MA'AM, and just WAIT! Someone will get to you as soon as they can!""  
  
The entire area went dead silent. People were staring at me once again, muttering about how that wasn't necessary. The complaints stopped. I slithered over to the card rack and picked up my two precious packs of cards. I ended up in the line beside the same woman who'd grabbed me, so she was glaring at me the whole time.  
  
""Hun?""  
  
I closed my eyes briefly and looked at the man in front of her. He just grinned. ""Biddies like that is why I drink. Gimme your cards. I gottem.""

I went away for vacation and when I came back, had been fired. Funny thing was, Greg had *also* been on vacation, out of state for a family reunion.  He came back into our shop a couple months later and I got the whole story.

You see, opening shop late, disappearing for half the day, ""borrowing"" things for his rec softball team, all that good stuff. BS also had a habit of calling his employees to cover shifts at the last minute -- an hour or less of lead time.

Greg, all the paperwork in order, tickets purchased, bags packed, everything was gravy. The day he's set to fly out, he gets a text from BS telling him he needs to get to the shop ASAP to cover BS's shift. (Not that BS was sick or had some important business function to perform. He just had a date.) No can do, obviously -- Greg isn't going to reschedule a flight at the last minute just to cover BS's ass. So Greg texts back and tells him that since the vacation was approved by BS himself as of two months ago

BS

... hahaha

Greg, and instead of heading to work, heads right to the unemployment office to file a claim for wrongful dismissal, paperwork and copies of texts in hand. Then he goes to a friend who worked for the city and gets a much more lucrative and rewarding job, same day.

Nice thing was, and *still got awarded monthly unemployment payments despite already having another job*. Apparently, in this state the unemployment office does a routine conference call with employees and employers when verifying claims, just to get both sides of the story at once. BS was blatant and unashamed of his actions, proudly admitting his role in the matter. Of course it's not like BS was punished in any way. As far as I know, he still manages that place... badly.",,self,standard,
1374079726.0,1ihulr,The time I was assaulted over a refrigerator.,thekrone,1396,299,205,"**WARNING: NSFW language**

Hey all

This is a story from many years ago back when I used to work at a electronics / computer / appliance / media retailer. Sorry it's so long. I get verbose sometimes.

The backstory:

Apparently a man and wife came in and wanted to purchase a refrigerator. They found a couple they liked for something around $1000. They picked one

The next day the woman came back in. They decided they had changed their minds

This is where the core problem occurred: She neglected to bring the credit card (presumably her husband's) they had originally paid with back in. At this time (I don't know if it's different now... I haven't worked there in over a decade)

A manager was called over. This manager told the woman (in front of two different customer service reps) that, of course, she made the two hour round trip to grab the credit card). The woman was not happy about this, but agreed, since they were planning on buying a refrigerator with that money anyway.

As the manager was processing the return, after the close of business today, we will no longer be able to undo this transaction. You will be stuck with the store credit and there's absolutely no way for us to get this money back onto your credit card, give it back to you in cash, etc. If you want the money back on the credit card, you need to show back up here to the store with the credit card before the end of the day, and then we have a way we'll be able to put the money back on the card. After the close of business though

The woman acknowledged this

Now

The next day, checking receipts, monitoring cameras, etc. Nothing out of the usual was happening, when all of a sudden I hear a loud commotion coming from the customer service desk. A woman is yelling at one of the customer service representatives something along the lines of ""You guys are thieves! Give me back my money!"" It was the woman from the day before. At this point, I have no idea what the situation is, though.

I ask someone to cover the desk for me

Apparently when her husband got home from work that night (after we had already closed), and he got pissed. She was sent back to try to do the return she was already informed would be impossible. 

The manager did what he could to calm the woman down. She was screaming and crying and talking about how we robbed them of her money, he had witnesses, and in addition, that exact policy was spelled out in plain English on both her receipt, and the wall right next to her. It was literally impossible for him to process the return now that the close of business had come and gone. At this point, she had $1000 store credit, and you can't return store credit. He apologized, and asked her to step aside if she didn't have any other business.

She stepped aside, but on her way out yelled, ""I am calling my husband. Wait until he gets here. You fuckers will all pay.""

Fast forward a few hours, ""Please point me towards customer service."" I point. He heads off that way.

I know there's going to be trouble at this point, we were a formidable enough force that I figured we'd be able to handle whatever happened. I got someone to cover the desk and headed over to customer service.

By the time I get there, again, and tries to calm the man down. The man isn't hearing a word of it, though. He throws the credit card and store credit voucher in the customer service reps face and says ""If that money doesn't get back on that card in the next two minutes, something bad is going to happen."" Well, he was right.

I approach the man from behind, your wife was informed of our return policies when she processed the return. There's literally nothing anyone here in the store can do for you.""

The man replies

My manager

The man says

My manager says

The guy says

Manager says

The guy responds

So the manager picks up the phone and starts dialing. Meanwhile, ""Sir, you have been asked to leave. You are trespassing. It is really in your best interest to leave now before things get worse.""

This apparently startled him. He didn't know I was there. He quickly turns and swings at me. Luckily for me, where the 400 lbs dude just holds him down.

The guy hilariously squirms and flails beneath the weight of this huge guy, he starts to calm down and bargain. ""Okay, okay... you're right... I should just go. Just let me up and I'll leave calmly.""

My manager, ""We gave you plenty of chances for that. You decided not to go. At this point, you assaulted one of my employees, and you are going to go to jail.""

And went to jail he did. He was charged with battery (for throwing the cards in the customer service rep's face)

I turned around and put on my smile and said

I was expecting a rude tone about something because his face seemed a little distressed but instead he smiled as well and said

I realized that I had been stocking everything else but somehow in the rush of the day I had forgotten to stock the corn and now it was empty

""I'm sorry sir.  I'll hurry and get the corn from the back.  I know we have some back there."" and I rushed off to get the corn.

When I got back I began to stock the corn.  The old man stayed around though and began to have a conversation with me.  He was a very nice old man and asked how long I'd been working at where I worked at

Today's story begins when we have a workman come in to look at our water line (the distilled water we use to mix liquid suspensions).  We have a suspended ceiling in the pharmacy

I have no idea what he was standing on up there, right through the suspended ceiling onto the floor, which is just carpet squares over concrete.

Everything in the pharmacy stops, but he is out cold.

So now the whistles and bells are going off in my head thinking credit card scammers because this is the ""poster child"" scenario for this to occur.

So I play along and start writing the sales invoice and gathering all the various components and boxes and packages and the ticket totals $2690.00 and she hands over a credit card and so I figure OK who knows?  I ask her if I should run it as Credit or Debit and she say's Debit.  Debit means you must have a pin number and less likely to be stolen. I run the card and it instantly gets an approval. I'm jacked.  So I ask Mom how she found us and she says that they had already been to 3 other stores and they looked at Anthony and wouldn't let them in and said they were closed.  Now it is about 7:00pm and they were close to closing time, unadulterated JOY. So seldom seen nowadays.  It really was.  So the TL/DR version would be:  Don't judge people by their looks, and every now and than let someone in to look around even after your closed, because you just never know.

1360775003.0,18gbtx,Bigot Manager Finally Gets What's Coming (First Story),KitInaka,1481,444,750,"To preface this story I should say a few things. 

1: This Manager has already had a talking to for being extremely sexist toward her male workers (myself included)
2: She also pins any work she might have to do off on everyone else in the store and sits in the managers office talking on her phone.
3: MLP:FiM has just been released and the new toys have just come in.
4: I've only been working in the store for a month and we just remodeled so it's taking longer than normal to learn the layout of the store.

I was an ""Electronic Sales Specialist"" at a popular overpriced toy store when a man and his son walk up to the Electronic Counter. 

**Me:** Hi! Can I help you find anything today?

**Dad:** Not sure. Me and my son are looking for looking for the new My Little Pony toys but we couldn't seem to find them. He's taken a liking to the show. (At a whisper) and so have I.

**Me:** Ah

I turn around and look into the Managers Office as its behind the counter and call for the Bitchy Bigot Manager (Hence forth called BBM) 

**Me:** Hey

**BBM:** Oh god...Shouldn't you know that!! (Get's up from chair) I swear. (Walks out of office and sees the Man and his Kid) Who's the Pony Toy for?

**Me:** This Guest and his child.

**BBM:** What do THEY want pony toys for?

(At this point

**Me:** The same reason that Girls want Nerf Guns. You know what? Nevermind. I think me and the Guest can find them on our own. (On Radio) Service

**BBM:** You can't do that!

**Me:** Oh yes I can. I've had it with your sexist attitude toward Men and in general. Personally

The BBM looks flabergasted as I walk off toward the back of the store but am stopped by another person who walks up. 

**Me:** I'm sorry sir. I... (I stop as I notice that this is the District Manager)

**BBM:** AH HA! Now your gonna get it for talking back to me!

**DM:** Actually no BBM. I wanted to stop him because I wanted to commend him for handling you the way he did. (To Me) Make sure these guests get exactly what they want. (To BBM) I think we need to have a talk in the back office.

I walk off with the Customer and his son and together we find the Pony toys and I help them pick out their favorites (Dad included) and as I get to the front I see the DM standing there. He tells me that the BBM was fired once they got to the back and that the Guest's purchase today is free of charge. He also gave me and the customer a 50$ gift card as he says that his son has also taken a liking to the show and wants to make sure that anyone can get the toys that they want.

**TL;DR** Manager was a Bitch and got fired for it. I got a Gift Card for standing up to her.

1373383010.0,1hxswb,It was his first day playing a Sugar Daddy,morgueanna,1291,280,114,"This story is INCREDIBLY long

Reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1hwyyp/retiring_from_retail_tales_of_woe_redemption/) awesome tale of outrageous expenditures reminded me of the few times in retail that I also had customers spending way more than they should.

Working in the Goth Store at the mall in a small town, meant that we were a one stop slut shop for some.

This one particular day everything is going smoothly and the mall is a little dead. Then two of my regular strippers come walking in, wearing a suit jacket. Um, ok, not our regular clientele, but hey, whatever.

I go over to greet them and immediately notice something is up. They're positively *fawning* over this guy, etc. It was like a parody of seduction.

I could tell immediately they were taking this guy for a ride. But again, he would hold on to it in a growing pile of lacy undergarments, too short skirts, and see through tops. After an hour, I eventually started taking the piles up to the register.

After *two* hours I was starting to lose my patience. They had tried on almost every combination of clothing in the store and done a little strip tease in each one for the guy. I was starting to think that this was a session- where a client pays for a fantasy

That's when he comes up to the register and tosses his credit card on the counter. ""Anything my girls want, and puffs his chest out. I swear to god, he *puffed it out* and tilted up his chin. I'm starting to look for the hidden camera because people don't really behave like this in real life, do they?

Again, completely oblivious to the idea that these girls are just taking advantage of him. I put two associates on the register to bag and ring everything up, and as they're going, I asked a few times ""Are you sure you want this skirt? Because it's the same as this other skirt,"" just trying to give the guy an 'out'. Nope, he wants it all. 

It takes almost an hour to ring it all through and the total ends up being almost three thousand dollars. It's at this point that he hesitates. Oh Christ

Card approved.

The girls squeal and kiss him on either side of the face

A few days later, they're back.

They come up to the register and drop the bags. ""We want to return this stuff, it don't fit right.""

I sigh inwardly and go up to break the news to them.

I smile and say ""No problem ladies. Do you have the credit card the clothes were charged to?""

Blank stares.

""Yeah...you see, but no money *today*. So you don't get any money *today*. If you want to return anything, you'll have to bring your...friend back in with his card.""

The women are furious and started cussing me out. That just made me happier, they would have asked for my district manager's info, and depending on her mood, she could have overridden me and offered them cash. Now, they were banned from the store for threatening me, and this being the only location for 400 miles, there was no chance they could hustle anyone else.

1366942085.0,1d4l5m,You Know the Owner? Well That Changes Everything.,leveraction1970,1200,189,71,"I worked in a medium sized video store chain for about a decade. I worked as everything from clerk to manger and district manger in that time. I have always hated customers. Hiding that fact was always a challenge. 

One day we had a customer that was upset that we had charged his credit card over a hundred dollars. We did this because he had rented 3 Sony Playstation games for his kid. Our games had those CD shield protective stickers that were stuck to the back and impossible to take off without destroying the game. His kid had tried to peel them off

When I came in later that day my employee showed me the games and told me what happened. I call their house and got the father. I explained what had happened and that I could probably cut him a little bit of slack on the replacement cost. His response ""Fuck you

A few weeks later he got the credit card bill in the mail and came down to the store to yell at me. I tried to explain that he was responsible. I tried to tell him that if he could go find replacements at a used game store cheaper I would refund the full price which we had charged him. 

He started off with the ""I'll sue you"" and then went to the ""I'll report you to the Better Business Bureau"" to ""I'll report you to the State's Attorney General."" When he realized that I wasn't intimidated by his threats he very smugly said this to me.

1369853997.0,1faa34,YOU TOOK MY RECEIPT!,mypenexploded,1192,202,155,"It's my first time posting here as I've been waiting for something particularly exciting to happen at work that would be /r/TalesFromRetail worthy. Let me tell you

I work at an international big box home improvement store as a cashier. I've been there for 2 years and am one of the most versatile associates on the front end; I can work lumber cash, front end cash, self-checkout, customer Service Desk and Tool Rental. I recently got a promotion to Head Cash (basically just opening and closing all the registers and managing the cashiers and lot associates throughout the day) and am in training right now for that. 

So I go into work this morning for 5am to open the 20 registers in the store and get things ready for the day. Now, and Returns sometimes isn't open until 9. Its just the way our schedule runs but it's fine because whoever is on self-checkout can open up on the cash next to it and the service desk can do returns. Not a big deal right? Well I didn't think so...

So this customer walks in at around 7:30. There's still virtually no one in the store at this hour except for the odd contractor, did you find everything okay, will this be on a store credit card today?"" and instead chooses to stare angrily at the screen that everything I scan is showing up on. Jerk. I finish the transaction with him, hand him his receipt, and wish him a wonderful day. 

Fast forward about 3 hours, and as I had already confirmed this morning that he wasn't the nicest of people, I slowed down my last transaction just a see bit so that the girl working with me (we'll call her M) would have to deal with him. I know, I'm a terrible person. 

So M greats him and asks if he has a receipt for the product he's returning, he says that's fine. So M gets to work scanning all the little odds and ends this guy has in his cart. She totals it up and its around $250. She gives our manager a quick call to get permission to give him back such a large amount, and she gets the go ahead as everything is in perfect condition. GMG signs the pin pad to verify the return, and she hands him his receipt and store credit and tells him to have a great day. 

He looks at the card in his hand for a moment
""What the fuck is this?""

I could see that M was a little taken back
""It's your store credit."" She answered politely. 

GMG shakes his head and smiles condescendingly before flicking the card across the counter at her
""I want my fucking cash back.""

Oh here we go. 

I had cleared the line by now but felt it was a good idea to stick around so I started fiddling with things behind the counter.

""Sir

He gets really mad at this obvious statement of fact (really, and once more says,
""I WANT. MY FUCKING. CASH.""

I saw that M was getting a little freaked out now
""Sir there is *physically* no way for us to give you back your cash. The computer wont allow it. You have to have your receipt or have paid with a debit card. I'm sorry but she's right

""Just PUSH the FUCKING button and give me back my FUCKING CASH!""

Oh right! I totally forgot about the secret 'give this back in cash because I say so' button! GMG isn't listening to either of us, but she doesn't take crap from customers. She walks in and asks him what the problem is.

""These idiots wont give me back my fucking cash!"" 

""Well did you have your receipt?""

""No!""

""Did you pay with a card?""

""No!""

""Then you're not getting your cash back. We need proof of purchase to do that

""WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!? ITS MY FUCKING MONEY! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BACK MY FUCKING CASH RIGHT NOW OR I SWEAR TO GOD! I DONT HAVE A RECEIPT BECAUSE SHE FUCKING TOOK IT!""

He's pointing at me now. 

Why's he pointing at me?

Oh

""Pardon?""

""SHE took my receipt! I was in here this morning and she was the one who checked me out. SHE TOOK IT!"" 
D turns to look at me

""I did help him check out this morning

""YOU FUCKING LIAR IM GONNA FUCKING SUE FUCK FUCK FUCK BLAH BLAH BLAH-""

""Sir if you don't stop swearing I'm going to have to ask you to leave.""

He obviously ignores her and continues on his very loud

At this point D gets on her walkie and radios another manager to Returns, 350 lbs at least. He's a big boy, and we'll call him J.
J walks up to GMG with a HUGE smile on his face
explicitly how us fucking idiot cashiers should be fired because we're stealing from him. 

J, ensuring that he's charged for verbally assaulting everyone in the room. 

""Now, or would you like to lose it and leave with me?""

GMG splutters indignantly for a moment, and now customers staring at him, grabs the store credit off the counter and storms out of the store.

Today, has never happened to me before. I lost my cool and I yelled at a customer. Not just snapped at, I raised my voice to its full volume and pitch and I laid into him. 

The event:

I work at a small family owned Liquor/Convenience store. When I say small

Every week since I was hired in May of 2012 this man comes into the store, the same conversation happens pretty much every time. This is the way it went today that made me lose it:

FH: $15.99?! That's a complete load of shit! Down at [Big box grocery with membership card that grants discounts] it's only $9.99! Your boss is charging way to fucking much for this!

Me:(In diplomatic retail voice) I'm sorry sir but I don""t make the prices. If you'd like the owner will be here [date and time] and you can take it up with him.

FH: You're fucking right I'm going to take it up with him you stupid fag! He's ripping people off with prices like these!

(I'm at a loss at this point, I pride myself on being really hard to piss off. I have never hit anyone out of anger in my entire life and I am now using all of my willpower not to slam my fist into this guys face. It wasn't calling me a fag that infuriated me, but the way he was speaking to me. Like not only was I an inferior form of life but that I was also mentally disabled)

Me: You know what? Fuck off asshole! Take the goddamn metal rod out of your ass. You want to pay $9.99 for some of the shittiest whiskey I have ever tasted? Then get your fat ass out of this store. I am sick and fucking tired of you doing this every fucking week! We are not [big box store]! You want that price, its $12.99 and only if you sign up for their fucking membership card, otherwise you're paying $18.99 for the fucking bottle. Oh, and you know what? You can just get the fuck out, NOW. I'm done dealing with your shit. Get your alcohol and chew somewhere else, because you are no longer welcome here. You have 10 seconds to get the fuck out that door before I call the police. 

And if you think I'm bluffing

FHL: I....uh..uh..

Me: (picking up phone) 10...9...I'd seriously get the fuck out...8....7....

FH: Runs out the door. 

I called my boss and let him know what happened. He came and relieved me for an hour so I could calm down. 

I know it doesn't seem like much here

I walked out the back door into the private alley

When I get back to the fitting rooms with the jacket

Me: Excuse me ma'am

Old Woman: Oh. I was just getting...my bag. I love this shirt. I think I'll buy it.

Me: This isn't your fitting room and that isn't your bag.

Old Woman: Excuse me? Of course it is

1357875603.0,16cx1c,A waiting wife.,crime_and_oats,1187,208,73,"Working at my part time retail superstore job for a couple years now

There was this elderly couple who I starting recognizing from only a few weeks in from starting there. It wasn't too difficult since they would try to talk to most employees before they even started shopping (they especially wanted to get to know me, presumably after church or breakfast, and crack incredibly well witted responses to whatever we were conversing about. We'd share stories, their's much more intriguing then any of ours could ever be. They'd ask how each of us how we were doing, how whatever they heard us say last week turned out, etc. They simply cared. Him with his slouching posture, dated 1980s glasses with tinted red lenses, dyed blondish hair that fights off the grays

Once our conversations and the laughter died down, clothing, or health products. Each with their own shopping cart going separate ways down the waxed floor. One of them would sometimes over extend the 15 minute time frame, leaving the other waiting in-front of the desk. Not that either of them minded, plus there were magazines they'd read. Once re united they'd combine their goodies into only one shopping cart, and if the goodies didnt all fit into one they would compromise on what to give us back (he usually had to compromise a bit more than she did). A sort of old timer budgeting. They'd check out, and if they bought candy or other goodies theyd rip open the bag and give some to their cashier. Said their goodbyes and seeya next weeks, but this time sharing the burden of pushing a cart.

About six months into this job, and she would either say ""oh no"" or ""I don't know."" The mister moved slower and slower.

Jump to 3 months later

Her other half didn't walk in with her. An empty hand. A not so big smile. Oh, waiting for him. How the fuck do we tell her she didn't walk in with him? How do we tell her that she forgot? We don't know. Then a new cashier a few minutes later, oblivious to who this woman is, asks if she's ready to check out. She says ""oh yes, sorry."" She said oh yes sorry! She's checking out! A weak sigh of relief.

The rest of the week I thought about her. About them. I convinced myself that he'll walk in with her, next Sunday. I was wrong. She does the same routine as the last Sunday. She waits for her missing husband. Goddammit, I was on the verge of tears.

4 Sundays pass. The hope of the week of thinking about them diminishes. She persists with the same routine. She waits. She waits until someone or something tells her its time to check out and go

I request Sunday mornings off. I ask a coworker that worked my first (the next) Sunday morning I had off in awhile about her. ""She didn't come in"" the fucker said. ""You sure? You know who I'm talking about right?"" ""Ya dude

And so, if either one of them came in the previous Sunday of every week since then and get the same ""no"" every-time. Every fucking time. The most humblest, modest, nicest, caring, loving, and I'm sure plenty of other adjectives that are beyond my vocabulary- couple I have ever had the chance to meet are missing. And now I'm the one waiting.

Cranky Bitch would make a recommendation, then Momma Timid would look to me and ask, ""What do you think?"" The vast majority of the time I said basically, ""Well, eclectic is going to be better than matching, because that way if anything fades or you decide to add something

Um

Papa Timid, ""Just go stand behind the counter. We'll buy stuff, then return it when Cranky Bitch leaves and have you help us for real."" While I would much prefer a world where people have spines, this is fair enough, so I went back to the cash to wait for a final purchase.

CB: You just have an excuse for everything

Me: No, don't buy them.

CB: Whatever! Hold this up *pointing to a pillow cover* so we can see it!

...seriously? It sitting right next to the things you want to compare it to isn't good enough? Fine... I held it up about chest level.

CB: No! Up! Up! Like this! *she demonstrated by holding her hands at the sides of her head*

Me: I'm not doing that.

CB: Your job is to help me and do what I say!

Me: No

CB: You need to shut up and do what I tell you to do!

Me: No

Now here is where I should point a few things out. There were only three of us running the store, and a base-level stock worker. Ideally that would mean me covering the door at the front of the store, the GM covering the door at the back of the store, and Stock working stock (obviously), BUT our large furniture storage is in the basement of the mall, and base-level stock workers don't have a security code to access it. We had a customer show up to pick up his table and chairs, so the GM left me his manager keys, leaving me at the front of the store and Stock at the back of the store. Stock has worked for us for two weeks and has no idea how to run a register

CB: You will do what I say or I won't buy anything from you!

Me: I won't be selling you anything today.

CB: Excuse me!?

Me: I refuse to help you. You're welcome to wait for another cashier

CB: I'll tell your manager!

Me: Please do. He'll come up here the second he gets back in the store (this is true

CB: You can't refuse to help me!

Me: I can. And I did. We're done talking.

She tried screaming a variety of theoretically insulting things at me (ie ""You think you're smart!"" ""Nobody likes people who are obstinate!"" etc), told her I was the only cashier and he couldn't help her. He informed her that the GM would be back at some point and he'd send him over. Meanwhile, I checked out other customers, which only enraged CB more and more. I welcomed her to sit on a sofa and wait for the GM, but that I was not going to help her. All-in-all, she waited 45 minutes for the GM to come back and ring her out. She told the GM I was crazy and cussed at them, called her names, ""None of that is true. Now don't come back to my store until you can treat my employees like people."" Her jaw hit the floor

True to his word, how they would explain to CB what happened to the things she picked out.

My sister works for the Mouse who likes cheese and throws birthday parties for children. I think his name is Chuck or something. Anyway, tokens and whatever else). One for $11.99 per child, $16.99 per child and the final one being $21.99 per child. So she ordered the $21.99 package... for 30 kids. There was a $30 non-refundable deposit paid in advance which goes toward the overall cost of your party. The Lady paid that with no problem.

On the day of the party the family showed up with only 17 kids, that they weren't expecting it to be that high.

Sure enough
Mom: $700!? I thought it was $21.99!
Host: That was $21.99 per child. We explained that over the phone.
Mom: I ain't payin' no $700!

The party host went to talk to the manager who then called the District Manager.
DM: You have to get something from them. Even if you have to lower their bill

The manager then confronted the party.
Manager: I can cut your bill to the cost of 25 kids but that's the best I can do that will bring your bill to $xxx
Mom: But I only have $3 to ride the bus home.
Manager: Ma'am
Mom: The girl on the phone said it was $21.99 and the deposit was $30!

As it turns out she not only thought a party for 30 kids was only going to be $21.99

The police were contacted at which point the party tried get the bus to pick them up and leave before the cops arrived. They threatened the boy at kid check (which is the store's policy to make sure you don't walk off with someone else's child) with violence, the family was taken to court and my sister never found out what happened after that.

This was either the stupidest scam attempt in all of history or the dumbest group of people to ever walk the earth. Sorry for the not-so-climactic ending. The story is second-hand.

1373295362.0,1hv7bp,She got me fired [Long Post]!,TiredRightNowALot,1174,229,61,"Okay

I was running a computer store at the time and once a week, etc.  During this meeting I had invited a few extra people in (I like to bring in associates from all levels of the business, so they can see the managers aren't plotting to fire people, or other bad things).

So, I don't remember that 100%).  We were talking for probably 45 minutes in total when I heard someone getting upset with one of my computer technicians.  I probably had the best team of technicians in the city for their knowledge, customer service and even pricing.  I hear this lady getting quite rude and to the point of yelling, so I excuse myself from the meeting and go out - I don't believe my staff should get yelled at... I get paid for that part of the job though, so here I go...

I come over to the customer and introduce myself, well tell me about how that happened and I will see what I can do.  She proceeds to tell me that the laptop was brought in just to be cleaned, and now there's no information on it.  Everything was erased; all her pictures, all her work, everything.  I agree that this is terribly frustrating, and that I would have to do a little investigating to see what happened.

I turn in front of her and ask my technician what was up.  He explained that the lady brought the laptop in with a malfunctioning hard drive; you know the type... bad sector, found that she was still under warranty and then phoned her.  He explained what had happened but since she was under warranty, he could replace the drive with one we had from a previous job and she would be fixed next day (typically we order drives in from the manufacturer so that they actually pay for the parts, and the job.  In this case, we didn't get paid because we used one that was considered our stock and also the manufacturer may or may not even reimburse us for labour for this too).

I turn back to the customer and explain that we definitely didn't break the drive; unfortunately the drive was dead on arrival and there would be no way for us to have ever saved her data.  The only option she would have for that would be to send it to a data recovery lab, which meant that we straight up lost money to help her out but thought we would get her up and running much faster than normal.

Well, and even giving her the old hard drive back so she felt more comfortable that we didn't steal her data.  She said she got it, she understood the situation and left.

A couple of days later, and we were the worst store in the city.  I got the complaint of course since it was my store, and I closed it off.  I record the solution for all of these things and basically just left this one at: customer will never be satisfied, we did a good job.  I made sure to come back and tell the tech that he did an awesome job helping this lady and to continue to be creative in how he solved issues; customer first.

Fast forward two years.  Lady comes back in to the store (she was a semi-regular customer even after the incident) and asks for the store manager.  I come up to the front of the store and say hello... I recognize her and she doesn't recognize me.  She proceeds to complain about a monitor that ""stopped working"" last night.  I take it over and hook it up to a test computer and it works fine.  I let her know and let her see it.  I explain that her video card may be having an issue, which of course she refuses.  I do have people certified (background checks, etc) to go to customer's homes and do work, so I send someone over to check it out.  Video card is dead.  She comes in, buys another, and we go and install it.

Next day she comes back to the store and asks for me again.  I walk up

It comes from my fast food days

So... I started working for a burger place, after a couple years I was an assistant manager so, of course, when problems arose I got to deal with it.    I can honestly not remember what year this happened, what time of year... any of that... best I can say is mid-90's (say 95-97 just for good measure).  

It hadn't been a terribly slow night, each and every meal was to be made different: with cheese, without cheese, no pickles, extra onions... you get the gist of it.  


OF COURSE!  flash forward about 15 minutes and the phone rings.  cue up the irate customer, he starts yelling and screaming and saying we made everything wrong.  I remember listening on the headset how he ordered and helped make the food.  We didn't get it wrong from how he ordered it.  Not one bit... guaranteed.  Regardless... he says everything is wrong and starts laying demands on me.  

""The people at my office work hard and are pulling an all-nighter!  We can't be bothered by this incompetence!!!""  

around this time he starts telling me where I can deliver the remade order.  Um... yeah, may have heard it and blurted it out... or just something I pulled out my ass).  Amazingly, he accepts this.

""Look, I will have your entire order remade and ready for you when you get here.""  

He tells me the entire order again, I could have gotten in trouble if the owner drove by or whatever but the guy had a huge order and seemed pretty pissy so I was going to try to appease him as best I could within my control.  He comes in, I let him know we are bagging up the last of his order.  Amazingly, he brought the ""messed up"" food and left it with us.  He was still acting kind of dickish but I did my best to be as nice and professional as possible.  If he was going to undoubtedly complain, he couldn't say one word about our customer service being rude.  

So, looked to show it was marked to have been made exactly as I wrote down and compared notes with his so that we knew each and every meal was right. He says all of them look right, so it gets all packed again.  Right before he picks up his bags I hand him a few coupons for free meals and apologize for the inconvenience, and offer my hand to shake.  Now... DTG had an attitude the entire time, practically sneered and probably just expected the worst out of some punk fast food kid... but what I just did flabbergasted him.  He looks to the coupons, looks to me, shakes my hand and thanks me... the first time in our dealings I felt he wasn't completely looking down on me.  I let him out the door and send him on his way.

fast forward a few weeks

Over the course of the next few years I saw him at least once a week and most times he would ask for me just to say hi.  At one point he gave me his business card and said if I had any interest in a different career to give him a call.  I forget what that was but I remember it seemed terribly uninteresting or just not what I wanted to do so I never did call.

So about two years ago I went with a friend on vacation. It was right after I had quit *D&amp;B* and was enjoying my first vacation since HS.  On one of our last nights there, go shopping at the outlet stores in the area.  Fine, I could always buy a few things.

So while she's out looking at shoes and handbags and shit, and some rash guards  (compression shirts) for BJJ.  I pick out a few shirts, and head over to the fitting room.  As I'm changing, I hear the door to the tall next to me swing open, and some general rustling noises.  Ok no big deal. That's when I heard an all too familiar sound. *Snip.* *Snip*.  

Well, a cut tag falls on the floor and lads between the stalls.  A foot reaches out, and kicks it back underneath the bench in their stall.  So I put my shirt back on, having tried on the last shirt I had selected, and walk up to the register. The two associates are sitting there, a male and a female. The female is helping a customer, so I walked over to the male

DBB: Hey man. I work LP for another company. I'm on vacation but whoever was in the stall next to me is stealing shit from you.

Now, looks at his co worker, and back to me, and simply says ""Ok"".  

DBB: Hey man, so if you guys do do something, just be careful.

At this point, is finished with her customer and asks what the issue is.  We will call her Belle, because she was a true Southern Belle. And I'm original like that.

Dumbass goes to open his mouth

Belle: Well what are you standing around for? Go approach them Dumbass#1

Dumbass#1: Ummm....Well.



Well Belle doesn't miss a beat. She marches over to the stalls and starts banging on the doors, or whatever it is they are using, and use it as a weapon.  Frantic rustling is heard, and suddenly a bunch of shirts drop on the ground. The door opens up, and out walks a young male we will call Dumbass #2.  

Now, ""It's that moment in customs when your asshole gets cold, because they just found the hash on you"".  And it gets awkward quick.  DA#2 is starting at DA#1, and DA#1 is staring at the floor.  Belle's mouth is wide open in shock and is starting between DA#1 and #2. It suddenly feels awkward. More awkward than farting at a funeral. Keep in mind that the other shoppers are staring at us after Belle made a racket.

Belle: Dumbass #2? You MOTHER FUCKER!  *Turns to DA#1*. YOUR BROTHER! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.  YOU TOLD ME HE NEEDED TO HANG AROUND BECAUSE YOUR PARENTS WEREN'T HOME! SO I WAS NICE AND LET HIM HANG AROUND! AND YOU'VE BEEN STEALING FROM ME? 

Oh god

 [This was me the whole time](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m884kuqDmT1qem02jo1_500.gif)

Belle turned out to be a smart cookie and didn't let her anger get the best of her.

Belle: Well, I can't prove you took anything else.  But I think you two should leave. And don't bother coming back unless you come back with whatever you've taken, or the cash equivalent.

DA#1: What about my paycheck?

Belle:  I think we can find a nice charity....

So the Super Dumbass Bros. give one last hateful glance at me, and walks me back to the counter. She thanks me profusely, and tells me she'll give me a $100 credit.  So I basically got two golf shirts and two rash guards for free.  I tell her I'm sorry and she says it's not a big deal, and that she should have known. Shrink jumped the moment that kid started working there, and she just ignored it.  We said our goodbyes and I walked out with a few shirts and hilarious story.

I work at a grocery store where every friday and saturday we give loads of food out as a demo. I was cashiering and it was during the middle of the summer around last year. If I recall correctly everyone was complaining of how hot it was but I hadn't been able to walk outside to get carts yet because we had been so busy. I just took their word for it.

Anyway there was a brief lull in the customers when I see a very old lady walk through the door all in shambles. I mean this lady was old

A:""Whats wrong mamm?"" 

O:""Oh I just had to walk down from Wal-blah to go to the bank but I didnt realize how hot it was until I got to the end of their parking lot""

I gasped because I then realized how far this little old hunch-backed lady had to walk because, but for a car maybe. Thats when I figured out she had to have walked at least three. miles. crossed a 4 lane road and walked back up to our store because she was so tired.

A:"" Are you okay? Do you know where you are?""

O: ""oh yes Ive been coming here since I was your age
She was wrong unfortunately because I had never heard of those street names before and the store has only been opened for about 14 years but I just went with it.

A:""Okay

O:""Oh yes anything.""

I didnt want to trust her judgement but I thought that was important first. So on demo we had chicken poppers with ketchup and I got her a glass of  water. Hey

A:""I'm gonna sit by you for a little while is that okay?""
she grabbed the plate from me and it wobbled in her shaky old lady hands and onto her lap where she ate them up kinda quickly. She leaned over and hugged me and I told her if there was anything else I can do.

O:""I have this phone but I dont know how to use it

It was an old flip phone so I found her contacts and asked her what her daughters name was. She didnt pick up the first time but I left her a message saying where her mom was. We started to get busy so I was called back to my register.

A:""Is it okay if I go for a little while I have to get back to my register. Im right at number 4 so you'll be able to see where I am

She squinted and nodded so I got up and went to my register. About five minutes later I saw her flip open her phone and lean into the speaker part really hard like she couldn't hear very well. Good news

And then later I found out she left her walker up at Wal-blah and requested her daughter get chicken poppers the next time she came back. She is one tough cookie.

As a little bit of background: this guy is an older Greek guy who owns a small but very popular local pizza/greek food/whatever you order restaurant. He's been running this place since before I existed, giving free sodas, hell, he's even got a deal set up with the town to feed the plow truck drivers in the winter (we're in New England). However, he does this within reason. If the kitchen messes up your food, he will have it remade. He will not comp you the entire meal for free unless there was an actual problem with the food (which has happened once in a blue moon). And he will not bend over backwards to satisfy a difficult customer. They usually get tossed out. All in all, you would think it's a great place to work, everyone tips

This was during a freak snowstorm one October that had knocked out power to the entire town and half the state. The owner of said restaurant and his brother had been smart and rented (they've since bought one for permanent use) an 80 kW diesel generator that could run the entire restaurant and then some about a couple days before. This accomplished two things. One, being the only place in half the state that has power, heat, and hot food has its monetary benefits. 

Anyway, and don't seem the troublemaker type. The other 3 order pizza, sandwiches, all kinds of things. The leader orders a grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes and other things. Kind of a strange order, but they make it without blinking an eye. All in all, their order ended up totaling about a hundred bucks. And since this place isn't that expensive, that's an achievement. The leader ends up complaining his sandwich doesn't taste right. No problem, the 4 take advantage of the crowd of people coming in the door and disappear. However

He goes into the contacts of the phone, this is John from Village Pizza, and I'm calling to let you know that your son and his friends ordered a large amount of food at my restaurant, ate it and then decided to leave without paying. However, it seems he has left his phone here. So, here's the deal. If he comes back by tomorrow, and pays off the tab, I will involve the police"". 

She is shocked

Sure enough, and receives his phone back. His parting words to the owner are another apology, in which he ""feels like an asshole"". The owner's response was a good one. ""No, see, you don't FEEL like an asshole, you ARE an asshole. Now get out of my restaurant.""

Gather 'round children and hear a tale.  A tale from a long

So my last story was well received so I thought I would throw another one out there for you guy and gals.  

Backstory: I was working as a waiter in a pretty typical restaurant.  We had our entryway in the middle and the north side of the restaurant was smoking and the south side non-smoking.  On this particular day though

We were pretty busy, it was awhile ago, but I'll do my best to stay accurate) of the following 3 encounters with these people (Man = Chris and Woman = Jennie):

**First Encounter**

Me: Hi

Chris: Yup.

Me: Perfect

Jennie: Non-smoking.

Me: Sure, but I can put your name on our list.

Jennie: [Starting to come across a bit bitchy] Are you kidding? Is there any way we can be seated now?

Me: Sure

(They discuss this for a moment before): Chris: Yeah

Me: No worries

I proceed to go through the normal spiel and return to my counter. 

**Second encounter**

Jennie: Excuse me

Me: [Excusing myself from the conversation I was having with a regular] Yes ma'am

Jennie: It reeks by our table.

Me [Genuinely concerned] I'm terribly sorry. Would you like me to come check on what it might be?

Jennie: [Huffy, gesticulating with right hand] I know what it is. It reeks of cigarettes.

Me: [Holding back bewildered amusement] Well

Jennie: But it smells really strongly of cigarettes!

Me: Ma'am

Jennie: It reeks and there is smoke everywhere.

It's at this point that I look over to check the area and make sure there's not a fire or something.  There was one person smoking.  In the smoking section. ONE.  I get if you are aggravated by smoke it being a problem

Me: I'll tell you what

I usually wouldn't have offered this with a pretty full house as they were already taking up a table.  Typically I would have told them they would have to come back up front and wait then

Jennie: Ugh

After about 10 minutes we get them over to a non-smoking table and we all move on with our days

**Third Interaction**

Chris: Excuse me?

I had no one up front at this point and turn my attention to him.

Me: Yes sir

Chris: [Gesturing toward his table] Yeah

Me: [After looking where he pointed and understanding the situation more fully] Is there something that I can do? Would you like me to have it re-made? Have you spoken to your waiter? (I was really confused as to why they were coming to me with a food related issue.

Chris: I don't know where he is.  She says it smells like smoke.

Me: Is it possible that they smell is still lingering in her nose after being in the smoking section?

Chris: [Looking downtrodden] ...yeah.

Me: Okay... um...

Chris: Look

I am left at this point to assume he wanted her to think he got it for free and just avoid the fight.

Me: Um... sure... 

I called over his waiter

Jennie: What are you doing?

Chris: I'm paying so we can leave.

Jennie: Are you fucking kidding?!

That actually caught me off-guard as even though she had been a horrible patron she didn't look like the ""swearing in public"" type.

Chris: Calm down

Jennie: No! You shouldn't pay for this fucking shit! (Quite the mouth on her in my memory) It smelled and tasted like crap!

I was getting ready to start damage control when - 

Chris: Shut the fuck up! Jesus. Screw this. [To me] Have a good day man. Sorry about her.

He then took her by the arm and walked out.

I was never more awed/ecstatic about a customers response.

But the two golden wins that I mentioned?  Those guys huffed and puffed and rolled their eyes and couldn't BELIEVE I was going to waste their very important time insisting on those last four measly cents.  So they both dug into their pockets and took their time and very very slowly counted out four pennies onto the counter like they were doing me a HUGE favor

Both times, while saying ""Thank you!"" and smiling.  Then I'd ring them up and finish the order and give them their receipt, all while acting like I hadn't noticed I'd dropped a couple of their precious pennies.

Now, but then they'd start to shuffle their feet and frown and worry that I hadn't noticed those dropped cents.  Finally, they'd begrudgingly offer ""...uh, you know you dropped a couple.""

I come here with a short tale of an exemplary staff member that unsurprisingly did not last long within our company.

Many moons ago I used to work for a well known UK High street health and beauty chain. Our store in particular was a very small store and as such we only usually had three members of staff working on sundays as that was our least busy day. 

This sunday was no different, she was one of the laziest and rudest staff members we had and she would frequently sit her large behind onto a foot stool and shuffle around make up for her entire shift rather than be useful in any single sense.

The day was a normal day and all three of us were there for the 10 - 4 shift. Kay had gone for her break at 12 because she couldn't ""last another minute without some food to keep her going"". This was pretty normal and I was more than happy to go for my break at 1.

Anyway

After devouring my sandwich and having a quick stroll to clear my head I walk back into the shop. 

I went to go tell Kay that I would be back out in a second as I just needed to dump my phone in my locker. But Kay was not at the tills as I expected she would be. 

Oh.. well theres a few people waiting at the tills but maybe shes gone to do a price check or something?

I walk round the store and eventally end up on the makeup aisle where a shock was in store for me.

The displays normally brimming full with expensive products were barren.

Strewn across the floor was a single blusher kit which had cracked and thrown it's contents across the aisle.

Shit.

I panicked and went to find the manager out back and told her what had happened. I was sent back to the front to go deal with the customers on the tills and a few minutes later the manager comes to the front and informs me that she had found Kay watching tv in the staff room having her second lunch.

Kay had decided that when I was out of the store on my lunch and the manager was in the office it would be the perfect time to have a break because noone would tell her to go do some work. 

Her laziness and desire to contantly stuff chocolate into her maw had cost our store several thousands of pounds in stock loss.

Amazingly.

Just purely amazingly

1372354071.0,1h6v0z,My 9 year old mac is worth $2k!,quinyd,1055,242,117,"This is a kind of reverse retail. I pay for peoples broken stuff aka i work in insurance as a claim handler. 

*This became way longer than I had expected

First a little introduction;

This story is from a few years ago when I worked for a big insurance company *somewhere* in Europe, which was nice. If I deemed it fair I could pay ~$3000 without asking my supervisor. If I needed to pay between ~$3000 and ~$15000 I had to mention it to my supervisor and above $15000 I needed approval. This was nice because my employer trusted me and my coworkers with a lot of money and 99% of the time they would support our decision. It was overall an awesome place to work!

One thing I learned pretty quickly was that people tend to overstate things worth and tried to get more money from me because they think I don't know what things are worth. Sometimes people got angry because *I’m too young to know how valuable their stuff is*...

*Now to the story;*

In this case a customer calls and tell me his Mac is broken. 
I'm immediately alert because; 

- 1. I know my Mac's; both older and newer and know what they are worth.
- 2. People ALWAYS assume their Mac is at least worth twice as much as it is. 

I start out by smalltalking with the guy. I'm always starting out with this, but I have to get him to tell me the truth.

So his Mac has water damage

I ask him what model it is and he says it is a G4. Here I stop him and ask how he can have a 4 year old [G4 Power Mac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Mac_G4). 

He confesses that he bought 4 years ago

At this time I'm already thinking that he won’t get much for his computer. 

He tells me it is worth $2000 and that he would like the money ASAP. 
When people tell me they want money ASAP, which I can get for him on *craigslist-like-site*. This is normal practice; I can try and replace the broken object or give him cash. 

Most people chose cash (understandable). 

I also explain that if he wants cash I can only give him $100. This, meaning I can give him $225. But he also have a *self-risk* of $125, that he has to pay every time he has a damage claim. 

He is

If you lost your fine working computer and was offered $100 you wouldn't be happy too. But you have to understand that I can only give compensation for actual hardware

I try and explain that I can't do anything else for him and that I suggest he take the offer of a replacement computer

He then goes on and explain to me that he need it right now and that he would like to go buy one ASAP
I become alert by this statement because

I directly ask him, I accept this because I’m a nice person :)

He again tries to convince me it is worth a lot more and I tell him the price reduction and that I know my fair share of Mac's

He is not happy at all and puts his mom on (SURPRISE!). I had to mute the phone and say WTF to my coworker next to me. I can see that he is in his thirties and I cannot understand how he believes that his mother can convince me to pay more.

She starts to complain and tell me that his son can't work without his computer. 
Again I ask what kind of work he does on this computer and I hear the guy in the background tell her that he doesn't use it for work.
I laugh to myself and tell her the same as I told him. 

He comes back on and I tell him he can talk to my supervisor who will offer him the same deal. Since I offer for him to talk to my supervisor I seem like the big guy and he believes me. My supervisor who has no idea about Mac's would trust my judgment and tell him the same.

He reluctantly accepts and I transfer the $100 to his bank account ASAP.

I tell the story to my supervisor

Just another day at the office!

I have a lot more stories from my days in insurance; if this one is well received I will post more!

1372190403.0,1h24vl,It's only porn if you touch yourself,toxlab,1013,208,137,"Time for another one of my rambling goofy stories. As usual

Right after high school, a local company trying to compete was opening up new stores near existing 'Buster locations. They were cherry picking employees for the management of these new stores. I was offered a ridiculous salary and quite a bit of authority. 

The new company was just a reskinned Blockbuster. same product, though.

Porn.

This was in Cincinnati, the man who prosecuted Flynt for obscenity, Simon Leis, was now the sheriff. And he still had a hard on for smut. It was illegal to sell Playboy, no adult films could be had, and his group of obscenity watchdogs patrolled business, looking for filth. 

Blockbuster immediately rolled over and showed their cute, and anything that was disliked was pulled off the shelves. They got rid of ""Last Temptation of Christ"" because of the letter writing campaign this group staged. Terroristic threats of arson and vandalism were the norm. 

This new store showed some balls. They carried NC 17, ""Private Screenings"". It was mostly softcore offerings like ""Emmanuel"", and ""Best Chest In The West"". It was all stuff you could find in any R rated movie. But the titles were sometimes a little salacious, and people would see the tapes, shelved spine out instead of flat so no one could see the covers, and wig out. Once or twice a week, someone would come in and blow steam about us being smut peddlers. I would ask for their card, wishing them the best in their future rental endeavors. 

At first, they'd get their lite porn, cash out, and bolt. As if there were some masturbation emergency going on. One guy would rent three, come back four hours later, and get three more. He did this four days a week for my entire time there. 

Occasionally

Me: Hello. Is Mr X there?

Her: This is Mrs. X.

Me: Hi

Her: We haven't been in there in weeks! We don't have any movies!

Me: Well

Her:(in the background


I'm shelving tapes one day, and his wild orgies and other bizarre behavior. After it was filmed, producer Bob Guccione (of Penthouse fame) decided that what the film needed was more dong. So he shot huge, epic hard core orgy scenes. He essentially inserted well known actors into a porno flick. This did not go over well in hollywood. 

I take it home. As soon as it starts, I start looking for other titles that might not make the cut. I inform my employers. Some movies are easy to rule out, just by the distribution titles. Others, not so easy. We had a copy of ""Party at Kitty and Studs"", the porno movie featuring a young Sylvester Stallone. The movie was softcore, but the trailers before it were hard. There are a few dozen titles that I find doubtful. What should we do?

The district manager doesn't want to shut the section down. Complaints aside, ""Hey, as long as I'm here, I'll grab ""No Muff Too Tough"". 

How do we solve this problem? The solution is that we must screen EVERY LAST ONE of these tapes. We don't have to take notes as the plot develops

This duty falls to me. 

The manager above me was a 40 year old virgin. He was scandalized when the DM suggested he do it. He had never seen a dirty movie

Every night

Asking an 18 year old to look for porn is a good idea. You have a preternatural sense about boobies. You are always happy to see 'em, blowing a teacher, and now she's in prison, having a lesbian three way? What happened here?"" 

This continued for about a month I believe I found a total of twelve tapes that could get us in trouble. We pitched them and continue on our merry way.

One afternoon

He: How dare you, etc. etc.

I: I can assure you, but the contents merit no more than an R rating.

He: HOW DO YOU KNOW? HAVE YOU SEEN EVERY MOVIE IN THE STORE?

I: Yessir
&lt;I suddenly realize how this sounds and start to blush&gt;
Erm

I am now sweating.

I: I HAD TO DO IT! I DIDN'T WANT TO WATCH THEM ALL! Really...I....

I want to give a very short introduction. I was a radio personality, I have stories that many others find entertaining. 

Here's one from being a body piercer:

I was working in a very small body piercing shop

Our shop was in a small strip mall that looked more like an old outdoor motel than a business center. the only other business of note was a hair salon a couple of doors down.

I had a woman call into the shop and ask if the staff had experience with genital piercings. I advised her that all of our staff had performed them as part of our apprenticeship and that I could answer any question she had. She said that she would just come in to talk to me with her husband since it was around the corner.

Cut to 30 minutes later and I get another call while setting up packages for autoclaving. It's the blonde that runs the hair salon next to me.

""Um

""Yeah

She stammered

As I mentioned, I silently cursed them for giving the girl next door some leverage with the property owner come lease renewal. 

I shut the blinds and go back to business as usual. Last thing I wanted to do was have them walk in with me giving them a knowing stare in case they were in fact that oblivious and not exhibitionists. Once they came into the store

After she spread her legs

""Ma'am

""Oh

""You certainly will not. You can go home, which crinkles like mad). When I exited the piercing room, they were leaving. She remarked with a 'see you later.'

*Yeah fucking right* I thought.

We had a poster made of one of our managers and it was put into photo. In fact when I was working the overnight shift it kept scaring the crap out of me because I kept thinking someone was standing in our photo area. 

Well this woman came in and starting chatting with our manager's poster. I sh*t you not she was there for 5 minutes before she went up to the front counter and asked our cashier why our manager wasn't responding to her.

Cashier: Ma'am

And naturally, you must fuck with those people. Take them down so many pegs, that they will be envious of pirates with peg-legs.  This, is a story of one of those people.

The hotel that our company was staying at was kind enough to offer free drinks at their bar from 3-5 pm during happy hour and we are talking unlimited free drinks. Most of the days that we were there I had to work past the cut off time but finally I was able to get out early enough and run back to the hotel just in time to make it before 5. 

I was literally the last person in line at 4:55 when a security guard stood in behind me to cut off the line as it would be past 5 by the time I made it to the front to be served. Cue asshole douche bag (we'll call him ADB) who walks up to the security guard at 4:59 demanding to be served. The security guard informs him politely that the line is cut off for today and he is more than welcome to come back tomorrow for free drinks.

ADB wasn't having any of that and starts berating the security guard for being too stupid to tell that it wasn't yet 5. He demands to speak to the manager of the hotel (a small and soft spoken woman) who gives him the same reason why the line cuts off before 5. He continues to screech and his voice only gets louder as I'm standing right next to him waiting for my ears to start bleeding. Next he dials their corporate office on his mobile and continues to scream about the lousy customer service and how stupid and rude the staff have been. 

I was about half the size of this guy and not a very outspoken person but I have worked many waitress jobs in my time and have experienced firsthand how awful and embarrassing it is to be berated like this in public and still have to be polite and courteous so something in me just snapped. ADB was still on the phone at this point and before I knew it I was in his face shouting at him, AND SHUT THE FUCK UP!!"" 

He was instantly quiet with his mouth open and his phone just dropped to his side. Clearly no one had ever put him in his place before. I turned around, shouldn't you?"" which shut him right up. 

I was still shaking when I ordered my TWO drinks (I needed it after that) and sat down at a table but it felt pretty awesome to put a rude asshole in his place. I was met with smiles and winks by other people in the bar for the rest of the night.

I ask for their age and they were about 2-4 years younger than the suggested age for the board game. I go on to mention this and start recommending games that I believed would be suitable for their age and that they would really enjoy. 

She keeps going back to the original board game she came in for and questions me as to whether or not her children would be able to understand the game. (How am I supposed to know?!) 

I politely replied by repeating the recommended age as shown on the box and repeated my experience with the game in saying that the rules are fairly straightforward

She dismisses my argument and says

2 weeks later, isn't; the rules are very straightforward and easy to follow). She claims to have done so and still couldn't understand and asked for a refund for a game that she had opened and attempted to play because apparently, the girl serving her in the store (me) told her that it was suitable for really young children (which I never said).

Anyway, very 'animated' cell phone conversation. He was pacing back and forth, and waving his free arm around pretty dramatically. From hearing his side of the conversation, it sounded like he had a major business deal fall through.

Just then a mother with a toddler sleeping in his stroller came down the aisle. She was clearly in her 20s at least, and didn't even notice that he almost walked right into the stroller. Just as she starts to go by him though, his arm knocks several of these heavy metal sculptures off the shelf, making a huge amount of noise. Two of them land right next to the stroller, waking the toddler up.

Now, heavy, metal objects smashing to the ground right next to you can be pretty upsetting. So he starts crying, and the mother stops a couple feet away to try and soothe him. Apparently this annoyed the guy on the phone, since he turns around and almost yells at her, ""If you can't keep your f---ing little brat quiet, you shouldn't have opened your f---ing legs

I couldn't believe that he'd actually said that to her, where my manager was. I told him what had happened, and he kicked the guy out of the store, and banned him from our store.

Before I begin, Lou.

*Today

My previous stories have all involved law enforcement.  This one, a father with his young son out for a walk, and years of Boy Scout training being put to good use.

I had only been working at the station for about 6-7 months, and eat ice cream sandwiches on the couch while watching re-runs of Ren and Stimpy.  As I stood my vigil behind the cash register, a small fan blowing still-warm air across my face, a man came rushing into the store carrying a small boy.  The man's face was that of near-panic; eyes wide, pale, muscles taught.  His voice shook as he quickly explained to me that, as he and his son were out walking, something that he had not experienced before

Sir

I vaulted the counter and checked on the little boy.  Yep, he was covered in hives, and his heart rate was insanely fast.  He whimpered in that pathetic manner that a young child will when they are very scared.  Damn.  I opened the door, and yelled for Alan (name changed) to run over.

Me:  ""Alan

Alan:  ""Uh

Me:  ""Good.  Listen closely.  Run up to the fire station, or the engines are gone, call 911, and tell them the same thing, then bust your ass back down here.  Now, repeat that back to me.""

Alan:  ""Run to the fire station, bee sting, call 911 if no one is there.""

Me:  ""Good.  Now

And off he went

*But Osiris32

A very good question, that is exactly what I would have done.  However, in a situation like that, time is your enemy.  Had I called 911, it would have taken a minute or two to get on the line with the dispatcher, relay them the information, and have the dispatcher call out the emergency.  Two, maybe even four minutes before the firefighters start rolling.  However, I was pretty certain they were still there.

As Alan was doing his Jesse Owen impression, nearly-$1000-investment first aid kit.  In it were the finest medical tools money (and a civilian) could buy.  Blood pressure cuff.  Pulse oximeter.  Stethoscope.  Medications.  Hell, it even had a suture kit.  (It got stolen out of my car two years ago, and I'm still pissed about it).  I got to work monitoring the kid's vitals, while writing down everything I could from the father, who was in tears.  Within seconds, I heard the wail of a siren.  Proper help was on the way.

Moments later, got him on an oxygen mask, loaded him onto a gurney, and rushed him out to the rescue truck.  Total time elapsed from the moment the father walked through the door to being in the truck, maybe 4 minutes.

I went outside and lit up a cigarette.  My hands shook.  I hadn't had to perform any sort of emergency medicine like that in years.  Kind of amazing how all that stuff I learned in Boy Scouts instantly came back to mind

I had the next three days off, first by giving me a big hug.  He offered to reward me for what I had done, which I of course turned down.  I explained that, as an Eagle Scout, it was my duty and pleasure to help other people at all times.  Seeing the little boy happy and healthy was more than enough reward.  The boy himself was a bit shy, but still said thank you.  I smiled all day long.

I work as a Salesperson in a major UK electronics retailer, trying to get bigger discounts and generally kicking up a fuss over €5 or €10 here or there.

One Saturday, but he wants to buy a Home Entertainment system. He keeps me busy for about half an hour, asking stupid questions, before deciding to go for the cheapest model; a display model that has €90 off.

Normally the problem with display models is that they've been used, just without the box. I tell him as much, and he starts to get angry, insisting that I give him another €20 off, which I refused to do, because we'd lose money on it. To placate him, I said I'd wrap it all up in bubble-wrap, we don't bother

So I go out the back

When I come back out with everything, and that he should get a discount for his trouble. Manager is having none of it, and says that the best he can do is offer him a reduced price on insurance/warranty, to which he very rudely declines, saying; ""I'm not planning on f***ing breaking it"". Manager tells him there's nothing else he can do, but it's a very good deal, so customer says he'll take it anyway. The whole conversation took about 10 minutes.
So I bring him up to the customer service counter to skip the crazy queues, even though he can see we're now very busy, and I'm needed. I'm still trying to be helpful, just to get rid of him, so I oblige.

""Are you parked far
""No

I'm kind of surprised, but I brush it off. I carry out the goods to his car....

And he sees the wheel of his car has been clamped.

Now on to the tale: 

I knew the table was going to be about as fun as a bag of razor blades when I walked up to greet them and instead of returning my greeting they just barked out their drink orders. Nothing says ""hello, and he wants an iced tea"". But what can you do? They're not sociable people, fine, I still have a job to do. I went and fetched their springs. Apparently I've been relegated to wench tonight. 

When I returned with drinks there was 10 dollars in singles sitting on the end of the table. The clown who was obviously in charge of this bubbly and outgoing crew had placed them there. He said to me gruffly

In my head I said

What I really said, you want to hold on to this, the bussers might get confused and think it was left from the table before you. I will give you the same service I give all of my tables; excellent. At the end of your meal when the bill comes you can then decide what amount of tip you'd like to leave."" And before he could respond I added ""Would you guys like to start with an appetizer?"" 

I could see in his face that he was going to object, but they didn't request anything out of the ordinary or ridiculous. 

At the end of the meal I ended up with a 9 dollar tip. Not sure what random wronging I could have done to lose that dollar, that was still 20%.

To begin

I'd worked there for 5 months and absolutely hated the job. I'd been at bad jobs before, the business was constantly in the red and there were so many restrictions on what employees could do just for themselves that it really did make my head spin.

My boss was to evil was Jack Nicholson was to crazy- she immortalized it in such a way that I often wondered if she had either a learning disability

This woman outright hated me and pulled no punches telling me. When I was happy

I think it was because I was full of hope- I was young, on the other hand, was trapped. She'd moved across the country to work here, her husband worked here, her oldest son worked here and she had no real viable options elsewhere because of that nasty attitude she couldn't shake.

I decided to quit when my mother was in the hospital and my boss outright refused to let me leave on my scheduled time because she wanted to hold me later doing busywork. I wanted to visit my mother, it was just a job, but I tried to be upbeat when I could and do my job. What more can you ask from a mere human being? Devotion for $6.50/hr?

The next day, and a full moon was in full swing, since every customer had some generic complaint, or had some special request that made a typical order impossible.

One customer came to the window (I was working the drive-thru, he called me the typical names- ""faggot"" for my long hair, and ""kike"" for my necklace (I assume?). It was at that point that I decided I was going home early;

""You wanna talk to my cunt of a boss?""

He just stares at me. I'm not yelling when I speak

""Y-yeah... Yeah

So I get on my headset; ""This guy wants to talk to my cunt of a boss. Amanda (not her real name)

Amanda stares daggers at me storms up to the window. Without even asking if she could help the man

""He did!"" the man says

""Me? Yeah

""Get out.""

""Well

""And don't come back! Leave your bowtie on the counter!""

I complied. I complied and laughed my way out the door to leave them fending for themselves. A bit of a cold move- I liked a few of my coworkers... Most of them were chain-smoking teens, but there were a few people I didn't mind working with.

I do inform him that it may be a while before he can expect any help from anyone else due to how busy it was and then he tells me that he wants to talk to my manager about my attitude.

See, but with talking with my boss. He owns the store, he's 60 years old, he's bald, and he's taking a nap. He sounds like a bad Arnold Schwarzenegger impression and, very consistently, holds mild discontent for anything other than his infant grandson and the almighty dollar. I let the customer know that the boss doesn't want to be disturbed and that I'd be happy to resolve the dispute myself but he insists

The boss bellows for me from his office(SAMMYYYYYYY, ""this guy wants to talk to you about my attitude.""

""What why this.""

I shrugged and he got out of his chair. I continued assisting other customers while keeping an eye and ear on the interaction. It was the husband of the thin sliced leberkase lady! Apparently she had asked for the big slab slices(she hadn't), rather than what she got(literally impossible). The boss pulls me off what I was doing to confirm that none of this was true, and then proceeds to mock the customer in front of the entire store, probably like 12 customers.

I was furious. I couldn't even say another word, I didn't stick around one extra minute. I punched out at exactly the time I was scheduled off.

Orange Bitch Be Trippin'

It is a steady afternoon in the world of thongs and titty slings, acting like I'm doing important bra inspection shit so I don't actually HAVE to do anything. 

Greeting customers like a pro and got that plastic retail smile on my face; I got this shit down to an ART. Hiding behind a rack scanning the perimeter and I see Orange Bitch (OB) and her mother (Nice Lady Mum/NLM) looking at the push-up bras

Orange Bitch is about 15-17 (I'm guessing the younger end of the spectrum), white *insert popular brand name here* v-neck, silver necklace with what looks like a cross on it or a T, navy *insert popular brand name here* shorts which are in my humble opinion too short, some damn ugly gladiator sandals and her cell phone glued to her plastic nails. Oh and I forgot she's fucking orange. No she's not fucking an orange. She embodies the colour orange; she IS orange. While her mum is short, plump, rosy cheeked, in typical mom capris and plain t-shirt.

Anyways, b. She just smelt a fart, or c. She just did fart. Nice lady mum and I get a small handful and send her on into the fitting room with varying sizes because Orange Bitch doesn’t know her size and doesn’t want to be measured.

The minutes drag on and nice lady mum has to go meet grandma at the other size of the store so Orange Bitch stays with me while I continue to try to help her. 10 minutes pass and she emerges out of the fitting room so being nice sales girl that I am I ask if it went ok.

OB replies

Fair enough, OHMYGODSHELIKEHASTOHAVEIT, so she makes her first mistake (other than being a general cuntybaws to her mother) she snaps her fingers at me above her head three times while calling, “Bra girl.”

No Way. Keep calm and don’t kill the sloot with your highland rage.

The problem with THE bra is it is on a 5ft mannequin…on a 5ft shelf…above the 5ft racks…on a wall. Being 5’2 I’m like sheeeiiiittttt

All right all right calm your pants.

Not being allowed to have a ladder (some other coworker fell off one a while ago so now no one in lingerie can use ladders) I tried to figure out how to go about this. The mannequins were legless and attached to a wide and heavy metal base on top of the shelf. So I had to slide the mannequin and then brace myself for all it’s weight (those bad boys are heavy….good thing I’m a beast). I’m teetering back and forth like a weeble wobble, relax), strip it faster than Jim Levenstein stripped himself in 1999 and toss OB the bra, disgusted at this animalistic act of speed and agility OB retreats into the fitting room.

It takes Orange Bitch about 3.5minutes to reappear

“Ummm like… I don’t like it so I’m gonna look some more.” She queefs in a nasally voice.

Sure fine whatever. I ask if she’s done with the previous bras

I go into the first stall on the left (Orange Bitch’s Room) and holy flying fuck monkeys it looks like a lingerie dealership threw up in there whilst pissing a Bombay hooker’s bodyspray. There are about 17-22 bras ON THE FLOOR, lipgloss smears on the mirror, ANOTHER coffee cup on the floor AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE PERIOD BLOOD ON THE FLOOR. You must be thinking oh it may not have been her, lots of people use the fitting rooms on a daily basis…We check out fitting rooms every 30 minutes (at the very least) to make sure this isn’t an issue. I was on fitting room duty that day, I checked it, and so I bloody well know it was her.

I slouch out of the room with my arms full of countless items

snapsnapsnap

“Bra girl. Braaaa girl. I need this bra.” Orange Bitch chirps pointing to yet ANOTHER 5ft mannequin on a 5ft self above a 5ft rack. You have got to be kidding me.

So I drop everything on my cluttered register and go to assist Orange Bitch. Keep in mind this bitch probably can’t even drive yet and is snapping at me and it is taking all my self-control not to push her down and sit on her ‘til she cries. I wrestle/molest yet another mannequin and hand her the bra and she floats off into fitting room.

FINALLY nice lady mum comes back and asks if we have a bra to buy yet and I politely tell her that I am unsure because Orange Bitch has been trying on more than strapless bras

“Orange Bitch

“It’s not myyyyy fault MOOOOOM. That stupid chunky bra girl doesn’t know what she’s doing.” – OB

WUT. You have the nerve to call me stupid when you can’t even contain your own menstrual blood??? And don’t even get me started on the “chunky” accusation. My rage is showing but I keep listening.

“The bra girl knows what she’s doing

“NO she doesn’t MOOOOOM. She practically threw one of those model ladies at me and made me go in a dirty fitting room.” – OB

AWWW HELL NOOOOO….ORANGE BITCH IS ABOUT TO BECOME ORANGE PULP.

“I saw you go in it looked fine. And I doubt anyone could throw those mannequins.” NLM (total GGG)

“It was after youuuuu left that she made the room dirty

Now I generally don’t care about disrespectful customers but it irks me when a child is rude to a parent especially a lady as nice as nice lady mum

Showtime. I meet Orange Bitch outside the fitting room.

“Did anything work for you ma’am?” I say cheerily.

“No. Nothing in this stupid store fits

The rage is coming.

“But I’ve been helping you for over an hour now and you didn’t find ANYTHING?” I push

“God I told youuuuu

I keep my footing strong.

“So I cleaned your fitting room and will probably have to again

“Well that’s your job. You’re a BRA GIRL. You’re SUPPOSED to wait on people like me so you get paid.” Orange Bitch said snidely while looking me up and down like I had leprosy.

Fuck it. 

“Listen Missy

Orange Bitch didn’t say anything just stood there with her mouth open looking like a hungry catfish

“Plus who’s my manager going to believe? Me? An employee of over 2 years with good standing? Or a whiney spoiled little girl?”

Orange Bitch spluttered and stuttered while marching off in a huff. Victory was mine.

TL:DR My jimmies get in such a bunch that I physically threaten a customer.

Nice days mean nice cars at the station.  And given the wealth of the neighborhood, and while playing Need for Speed.  The car that BDB1 (Bald Douche Bag 1) drove in that day was no exception.  A gloss-black, 630 hp, 6.5L V-12 Lamborghini Murcielago LP 640 Roadster.  A car worth more than most people's houses.  Also something completely unreasonable to own in a residential location with a relatively low highway speed limit.

I definitely noticed the car drive in, does the usual she-bang to figure out what to get him, etc etc.  But things get a pit odd when the attendant goes to the pump and tries to use the card given to him.  He's obviously having difficulty with something, but he's a bit too far away to see what.  He goes back to the driver, speaks with him for a moment, and then hurriedly backs up as the driver flings open the door and starts storming towards the store.  BDB1 then rants and gesticulates towards the pumps, to which the attendant quickly moves and begins punching in the codes for a pay-after-the-fact.  Great.  Entitlement

Now BDB1 is very easy to describe.  Imagine Mr Clean.  Same bald head, same musculature.  Now, replace his face with that of Christopher Titus.  You are now 99% accurate.  Oh, and have him doing this rather amazing scowl/sneer to get his mood right.

""Your guy out there can't seem to make my card work!"" he loudly states, it's a variation of the Platinum American Express card that you are invited to have.  The minimum monthly payment is $2,500 and it's limit, while not actually being infinity, is EXTREMELY high.  They are very rare and only owned by people or businesses with tons of money.  They are also made out of metal and slightly thicker than standard plastic credit cards.

Which is why it wouldn't run out at the pump

""No problem sir, either.""

It didn't.  I couldn't get it to fit through the slot on our card reader.  BDB1 then snatched the card out of my hand

""Well then

""Sir, I have to run an manual imprint of the card."" (*Aside:* I was quite used to doing this, our satellite connection went down all the freakin' time).  ""I can't do that with your card, because the numbers aren't raised, and they won't allow me to just write them down.  I'm terribly sorry, do you have another card you can pay with?""

Cue a long rant about how this card was supposed to be accepted everywhere, the usual drill which I quickly tuned out.  As he was stroking his ego to near completion, I was continuing to monitor what was going on outside, just in case something more important could offer me an excuse to dismiss this guy, such as someone dropping a piece of paper on the ground.  But what I instead saw was one of the local cops, pulling up to the store.  While I took note of it, it did not fully register in my mind, nor did I expect anything illegal to happen.

So the cop walks in while BDB1 is in midbluster, and leans against the counter as if to say, ""Boy, I've had a boring shift, but here's something entertaining I can watch for a few minutes.""

I recoalesce my attention on BDB1, he's a BLACK AMEX HOLDER.  I explain that since I physically can't accept the card due to equipment issues, I'm going to need another form of payment.  At this point, BDB1 opens his mouth and says something that gives me one of the greatest openings in the history of things being open:

""Well what would you do if I just drove off right now?""

I tried, as I replied, ""Well sir, I wouldn't be able to do a lot.  But the guy behind you might do something about it.""

BDB1 turns around to see the local cop, he produced a different credit card, ran it, signed for it, and stormed out of the station.  As soon as the door closed, the cop and I both started laughing like crazy.  When I could finally speak again, I told the cop

J then accuses me of being racist (not the first time, and repeat my original explanation. 

He continues to get loud, and you think I stole this shit"" 

Well I didn't, or I'd stop letting him sell to me altogether. He didn't like that. He got louder and more obnoxious. There were ~4 other people there waiting, and it was getting embarrassing. 

I asked him to leave. I was very polite about it. W was telling him to calm down and just leave. J was not having it. 

Tells me to fuck off. I say okay, little skinny lady. Nicest person you will ever meet until she gets pissed. So she comes out into the buy shop, and takes a look at the kid. Asks what the issue is. J starts yelling. 

She looks at him, and let the grown ups talk. 

So my manager starts talking to W who is visibly nervous/embarrassed. J is still yelling. Myself and another bigger co-worker escort him out. 

As we're walking out the door

Turns out this lady was W's mother, and tells him to get in the car. Pretty sure J starts crying at this point. My face hurt.

1371606743.0,1gml24,The dread lobster cart,toxlab,956,228,160,"Something reminded me of this tale of uncomfortable nonsense


I was working at a very high end steak house as a cook. The prices were high

The menu was very simple. Four or five cuts of steak, and that's all. We were very good at what we did. 

I was on saute, and the lobsters. The lobsters were HUGE. I mean, bigger than your head huge. A fairly well known musician once described them as ""bigger than a puppy"". I think the smallest one I saw in a year of working there was four and a half pounds.

I had to dispatch these brutes. 

No simple trip into boiling water for these guys. You had to split them down the middle, remove the pouch like stomach from the head cavity, and add in heavy cream. 

The tasty bugs would still be flailing their legs around as you set them in a broiler. The cavities would release air as they died. This meant you were sticking a screaming animal into a fire. The tiny little ""aaaaaaah"" that came out was disconcerting. Especially after you poured in the cream. Imagine filling a screaming animal's face with liquid. You got ""aaaaaaaahgbgbgbb"". 

***EVERY. FREAKING. TIME.***



But

Now, even providing a provenance for your beef... (holding up 18 oz steak) ""This meat was raised by XYZ in XYZ town for our exclusive stockyards.""

The ""great reveal"" was the lobster. After describing everything else, this means they are slapping their tails against their bodies as you struggle to hold on. A food critic once called it, ""being threatened with a live animal."" It was certainly dramatic.

The servers would call it back. ""Whack a six."" This meant dispatch a six pounder. I did this all night long. Lobster blood is thick and grey

Whenever new hires were shown around the restaurant, here. His name is Kenneth. Hi, Kenneth! How are you? Would you like some lemons and melted butter? Sure, I just have to do one thing first..."" **WHAM!** Knife through the carapace. Split the tail. Swing it around. ""What's that? Not your head? but what if I just...**WHAM!** Butter, cream, oven. Hey look, he's dancing in the broiler.

I would amuse myself with these little dialogues. Especially when they got to the ten pound and up range. Those suckers fought back. I would pet them and make up back stories for these guys. Whole telenovelas were acted out for the amusement of my cohorts. 

One week

The order finally came through. Time to dispatch Big Daddy. YES! I ran to get him. 

I cradled it with both arms. My coworkers were amused. They knew I had been waiting for this.

Little did they know, I patted his shell. ""things in here is mighty dangerous. I can help you out, if you know what I mean...""  The other cooks are snickering. It moves forward a little. I drag it to the edge of the board. ""Oh, yeah. Feisty. I like that."" I drag it to the edge and start humping the back of it's tail. ""Say my name, baby. Call me daddy. Yeah. Yeah."" Knife goes up, overhand psycho style. **WHAM!** I pin him to the board. I look over. My coworkers are looking back at me, smiling.

And then I notice. At the edge of the serving window

She is petting one of the cart lobsters.

She has a look of pure horror on her face. One hand is by her side. The other is touching the cart lobster's back. Her mouth is wide open. 


""Oh!! Oh God! Oh God!"" I stammer. The giant lobster is trying to flap his enormous tail. I have to finish cutting him in half. Then the butter and the cream. By the time I've finished this

My guess is she just didn't have the words to describe what she saw. They ate


I toned down my act after that. I imagine it made for some very entertaining therapy sessions down the line...

Jane is lazy.  She wanders off from her register and somebody has to hunt her down when she has customers.  She's no-called/no-showed three times

I work at the local movie theater, but honestly I die a little inside when I hear I'm going to have to make snack packs for 100 kids. 

Story:
On a fine Thursday morning, the kids are bringing their own money to buy concessions. Not a problem, mornings usually aren't that busy and children are usually some of the nicest and most polite customers we get. 

The day care arrives, a hotdog, and a box of candy. Now, this kid is about 9 or 10 years old and I know he can't carry all that himself. I ask him if he would like a tray to help carrying that to his movie, and naturally he says yes. So I go get a tray and help him put all his food and drinks into it. As he turned from the concession stand I saw all of the kids' faces around him light up with amazement. Many began to whisper about the kid and his tray, ""look at how much Billy got!"" 

The next kid asks for a box of Sour Patch Kids. I get the candy and am finish ringing him up when he sheepishly asks for a tray. Even though we both know he doesn't need it

Now shoplifters using children is nothing new.  And usually it incurred a charge of child endangerment.  However sometimes the cops would let it slide if the person co operated and the child was so young they had no way of knowing what was going on.  That being said

One fine sunny afternoon, ""Stacy"" is watching these two teenaged girls, pushing baby carriage around, with a blanket covering the inside of the carriage.  The two girls are acting suspicious, removing clothing without looking at size, style, or price, and my co worker goes to get ready to verify that they did not exit with the items and that the fitting room was empty.  

Now our store was two stories right in the middle of the mall, verifies the stalls are empty, and right at this time the girls are exiting.  I tell Stacy that the STOP is good, and to proceed.  Now our LP office was on the other side of the store, near the parking lot. So I had to exit the office, and proceed through the store to get to my co worker in case anything happened, without running or causing a scene.  As I am rounding the final corner at a fast walk, and out in the mall, but I didn't go because theres actually a baby in here.""  

Wat?  

They actually left a real live baby, bring the kid inside and take care of it, and I'd chase after one of them. Stacy pointed the way of the food court and said ""The fat one went that way.""  Like a slightly overweight lion, chasing after a gazelle the size of a hippo, the chase was on.  

Now our company, and when you can and can't give chase.  As with most stores, if they go into the public parking lot, you can't chase, as its a liability.  However in the mall, we had a good standing, so as long as they were in public mall space, I could chase them to my hearts content.  At this point, so I could see her waddling in the distance.  I take off

Anyways, the police who are always in the mall have been alerted and are right there, so they grab her before I can.  She starts yelling that I am chasing her, tryna ""grab on her goodies"", and they should ""get dis white boy offa me"".  The cops naturally just look at me and say ""What have we got Drunken_Black_Belt?'  I tell them shoplifting pants and such.  She of course continues to say she doesn't know what we are talking about and that I'm tryna rape her.  So thats when I drop the big bombshell:

""Ok, is it yours or the other girls?""  

The cops naturally have a look of ""WAT?"" on their face.  I explain the two girls left a baby behind

I radio Stacy en route, cops search her, we sit her down.  Show the cops everything we have, they interview Stacy to get her side with the baby, who was like 8-9 months or so.  So the cops sit down, and explain to Queen Hippo that Department of Child Services are already going to be contacted for an investigation.  But if she lied to them even once, and didn't tell them everything, told us who her friend was, a ton of ORC info

But then I worked in retail.

I've seen the cops called on my employers because they would not honor a return without a receipt or any proof that the product is even from us. I've listened as one man went on a screaming tirade about how he was going to hand out balloons that said how much our business sucked because we wouldn't let him use a coupon that expired a year ago. I thought I saw everything.

But then yesterday happened.

Yesterday I caught a woman trying to steal.

Now theft is an issue at my store, underneath their massive bags of topsoil. There was even one lady who made the owner load her car with stolen goods. He thought he was helping her and he never asked for a receipt. When he came in to yell at me for not stickering her items as sold, I informed him that I never rang her up. 

Needless to say

But this was a first for me. Sure I've found the occasional ""forgotten item"" tucked in the corner of a cart

Due to the main greenhouse being hotter than a Ghost pepper in the summer, regrettably, my boss has yet to find a way to clone me so I can work two registers.

I was working on some managerial stuff and online dress shopping

No ""Thank you for your patronage"" sticker hung from the expensive hanging basket she had in her cart. The other cashier shook her head ""no"" when I inquired if she had rung her up. So I hopped from my post

Me: Hi M'am

Her: Oh! (starts rummaging in purse) You know...I...I was just thinking....I think the cashier inside didn't give me the receipt. I thought receipts were optional anyway!

Me: Inside? I'm sorry m’am; we don't have a register open inside today. And a receipt should print out every time payment is tendered.

Her: But...there's...well...ummmm....there's a man! Inside by the desk! I saw him.

Me: Do you mean (employee's name)? He's not a cashier; he's at the garden supplies desk. Did he take money from you m'am? Because he shouldn't have.

Her: Yes!! He took my money. I assumed he was a cashier. He said he was.

Me: I can't believe he would do that. He is my brother (true story). Let's go inside and talk to him to get your money back.

Her: No he didn't!! I mean

Me: I’m sorry m'am. I can't let anything leave the premises without being paid for.

I escorted her to the line and stood by her side smiling until she made it up to the cashier (about a two minute wait). She was sweating uncontrollably but I chalked it up to the heat. The other cashier rang her up and gave her the total. Ms. Blue Pants opens her purse and all of the sudden ""Oh no I left my wallet in the car

She never came back.

But she did make her husband call and complain that we harassed her and accused her of being a thief.
The owner told him that they had security footage of her leaving the store with unpaid products. He got all flustered and said the boss that maybe she forgot to go to the register. The boss told him next time we won't forget to call the cops.

One entrance that leads to a burger place, and express sandwiches. Also a bunch of energy drinks and snacks. You know

My job

This is actually posted on a sign under our hours. Two and a half years into the job and I never caught anyone stealing. Until the winter, trying to figure out what you want. This is the looking around you do when you are trying to steal. When he thinks I'm not looking, he puts energy drinks into his jacket. I put a quick call for the campus security to show up on the radio, just in case. I know the guy, he's downstairs and at the door in two minutes.

However, and every cashier has noticed him stealing by now and is giving me looks. I wave it off, giving them the signal that I'll handle it. He looks at this cell-phone, saying ""Shit, I gotta get to class!"", and proceeds to power walk down the ramp out of the store. I'm already at the railing, and I grab him by the arm. Here's how the conversation went.

Me: ""I honestly didn't think you'd try to walk out with it all. Are you insane? Did you think I wouldn't notice?""

Him: ""W-what are you talking about?""

Me: ""Look, not only do you go to jail, you also get kicked out of school permanently.""

Him: ""Bullshit! You can't prove I stole anything!""

Me: ""Look. I won't tell anyone if you just put the drinks back. But if you try to walk out that door with all that

Him: ""Fuck you

He then proceeds to walk out. I quickly do a quick call on the radio

Me: ""You really had to call my bluff

Him: ""FUCK I DIDN'T MEAN IT! YOU CAN'T KICK ME OUT OF SCHOOL!""

Me: ""Sorry kid. Maybe you can still get a good degree at community college.""

I promptly cleaned off the energy drinks and put them back on the shelf. About a week later my security campus friend tells me what the kid's fate was. Kicked out of school.

The customer comes in and is in a hurry

Then I attempt to move the stack of 30 pallets with the power jack, I'll just use the forklift to separate the monster stack into two smaller stacks.

By now my manager is calling me on the intercom to bring this stuff up to the front and I talk to her briefly to explain the situation. She gives me shit but lets me get back to work. She gives me shit about everything

I finally get the empty pallets out of the way and start to bring out this pallet of flour. I get it almost out onto the sales floor when I notice that two of the bags have ripped wide open and flour is spilling everywhere. Two of the bags on the BOTTOM of the pallet

No way to get to those other than unloading EVERY. SINGLE. FUCKING. BAG. 

So I am sweating like a slave hucking bags of flour onto the floor. I get the two broken bags and set them off to the side

Pallet loaded, which actually calms my anger a bit. I grabbed two bags of flour from their regular spot on the shelf to bring my pallet total back up to 50.

I follow the customer out to her car because I'm the only jackass available for the carryout apparently and she opens up the hatch to this:

Well

I open the hatch back up and start getting creative. Years of Tetris have prepared me for this moment. I manage to shove another 10 bags into every crevice I can find. I stack the remaining 9 bags on the front passenger side. And I've got one bag.

One.

Bag.

I crawl into the driver's side and shove the massive stack around so I can stand up the last bag of flour behind her seat.

Lets go back in time to a time of wonder and cheer.  Clinton was president and I was working at a big box retail store.  I worked in electronics and

As with all large corporations, etc on how to handle the release of the machine.  I was excited... I couldn't buy one yet but I volunteered to work the release just because.  We get the typical speech.  Employees can't buy them if on the clock, no putting systems aside for friends, all stock must be sold, etc.  

So, it was all over.

****Tangential note****  most amusing was the Hot wheels collectors who argued with management that it was unfair to let the PS2 line people in first (huh?) and they were afraid the people in that line were LYING about being there to get a PS2 in order to get in first to get to the Hot Wheels.  Yes... that happened.  Look, by far, the biggest freaks of the collecting world.

****TANGENT OVER****

So, talks to SH for a minute.  SH asks me to go to the back room, the games cage and tells me where to find 2 PS2's in there.  Huh... I kinda laugh to myself... thought that wasn't allowed but whatever... it was her call.  Transactions made, go about my day.  

Forward to the following week.  I get to work and almost immediately am called up to the offices where I'm introduced to Katie

Uh Oh.

Well, were people pushing, etc.  They asked if I had any concerns or anything to say regarding the release.  That's when the pit hit my stomach.  I knew they were fishing about the PS2's that had been held but I answered the questions exactly to what was asked and offered little else... not being evasive, but rather just taking the question to be straight-forward and answering in kind. 

Then, very heavily, that I was the one that put them away and even point out that I was smiling on camera.  I explain, first, I' am a gaming fan and was just excited so that explains my smile.  It dawned on my pretty quickly the cameras are the entire reason my supervisor, SH, had me get the PS2's from the stockroom... and had me ring up the transaction.  I don't think she did it out of spite or hate... simply I was the newer person to the team and easier to set up.  So I tell Katie and LP guy exactly what happened.  I wasn't going down for this.  I didn't do shit and I'm not going down for her.  Katie says she believes me completely... asks me to write down everything I've said. 

We finish our meeting and she says I can go back to electronics but instructs me not to talk about what happened with anyone.  

the next day I go to work.  After clocking in

She was fired.  People talked.  I played dumb... didn't know what happened.  There was one guy I worked with I got to be very good friends with that I eventually told... but I think that was after I left that job.

I'm getting paid better then what I would at any other retail place, ""okay, but, I need to know what to do. What kinda questions to ask"". Boss Man looms over me and then gets in real close, his breath smells like booze and he reeks of old cigarettes. ""Porno Manager just ask standard questions. Make some crap up. I have some ""important"" business to attend too"", he explains, and then as he's leaving he shouts out ""Don't make me regret this!""

A week to hire some rookie on, the guy has little experience, and lists ""porno watching"" as his hobby. A sad thing to say he's the least terrible applicant, i save his resume and wait till better ones come in.

A few days go by and a few interviews

He comes in the next day well dressed and on-time. He gives me a firm handshake and manages to impress me in the interview. Success! Maybe things would not be so bad, he comes in an hour late. That pisses me off, but, I'll allow it to slide just this once considering it is daylight savings and maybe he made an honest mistake. 

I get him started on the register and just up to date on the products. it'll just be me and him today so I can give him the training he'll need. Today's going to be a slow day today, who knows. Out of the blue he comes up to me and says ""So, this is a porno store, right? Do girls come in here and get naked and get f-d? Do we got glory holes"", he says, I explain to him that we are not a ""porno store"", as we focus on improving peoples sex lives. ""You mean a porno store, I just sigh and go off to doing my work. I'm not going to like this guy.

All through the day he keeps asking me stupid questions like where all the girls are or why aren't there any people having sex. As best I do to explain, he says in such an odd tone suppressing a giggle. I tell him if he needs me he can call me on my cell, I'll be across the street at McD. With that I walk off.

After getting my food, please don't be what I imagine it is. I open the door and there he is with his pants down watching a porno movie on my computer.

""Please tell me you aren't doing what I think you're doing..."", he says confused as to why I'm so mad. I tell him to get out, he's fired and he's lucky I don't call Police.

One day, confided in EW. By the end of the week, EW had outed John to the rest of the staff and embellished how Ann found out to include her walking in on John and another guy. Fortunately, the staff loved John and rallied around him, but what a nasty thing to do!

In addition to being a bitch, where he spent the balance of the day whining that he wanted a lemon drop. Finally, a coworker - a sweet girl who liked to make people happy - bought a bag of lemon drops for the kid, who informed her that she must be stupid because a lemon drop is vodka, lemon juice and sugar.)

Anyway, if we scheduled EW to work on a Monday morning, she failed to show up a full 50% of the time. It had been about 6 months since we hired her, which, coincidentally, was how long she needed to work before being eligible for unemployment benefits again, when we stopped scheduling her for the 6-2 shift on Mondays. We gave her the 11-3 instead, obviously resulted in her losing some hours. EW did not like that.

It was about 11:00 at night and I was at home when my phone rang. It was EW

So I eventually hung up and I called my boss and told her what had happened. We talked a bit and decided EW was more trouble than she was worth, and I have decided to take your advice and fire you. Goodbye.""

But that isn't the revenge bit. The revenge is when she filed for unemployment. I know a bit about how bureaucrats work

Unemployment Guy: ""EW says you cut her hours. Can you explain why that happened?""

Me: ""Well, I think he has an alcohol problem. She hasn't been dependable on Monday mornings, so we decided to let her sleep in.

UG: ""But she was a good employee other than that?""

Me: ""Yes and no. She's good at the work,' and I am not going to be called a bitch in my own home.""

UG: ""Wait... she asked you to fire her?""

Me: ""Over and over again. But I seriously don't need to be called a bitch in my own home.""

One Thursday in November, and just the exertion of walking would make me cough my brains out. (This was 1998, before the ubiquity of hand-sanitizer. I had a package of alcohol wipes I would use to sanitize my hands before handling a customer's credit cards or cash.) Lucky for me, no one pulled up to full-service that shift, until about 8:30, when Mrs. R. rolled in. I went out to meet her.

""Dawnsteel

""Thanks

""Well

""About three more hours, Mrs. R.,"" I said.

""Is your bride-to-be going to feed you chicken soup? Nurse you back to health? She should!"" she declared. I'd told her that I was engaged a couple of months before.

I finished pumping her gas, and sent her on her way. I noticed that when she left the parking lot, she didn't turn toward her house, but I didn't think anything of it.

About a half-hour later, she drives past it and up next to the door of the booth. She rolls down the window, and as she hands me a brown paper bag, she says, ""Get well soon!"" and she drives away.

I got back inside and look in the bag. I found a bottle of Advil, and a roll of wintergreen Lifesavers. There was a note inside that read, ""The mints are so you'll have fresh breath for get-well kisses.""

**The Shuffle**
In one of the stores I used to work in we would sit behind the counter and watch people come up to the door and do what we liked to call the ""are they open?"" shuffle. (done to the beat of ""We will rock you"") 
March up to the door, (wonder why the lights are off) pull on door twice, lean over and see operating times,(it should be closed... but I""M here so they must be willing to make and exception) pull on door twice, look up at open sign (clearly not on) above door. pull on dor twice, knock and call ""HELLOOOO!"" Pull on door handle two final times, wander away mumbling obscenities while we all sat and stared in awe until Either me or my manager would ask

**I""M SPECIAL**
One night back when i was a third key

So one night we are closed

For a few heartbeats I think... That's gonna be a guy tapping his gun on the glass and I'm about to get robbed again... FUCK. But I glance up and it's a man in plain clothes tapping a police badge on the glass right next to our operating hours sign (right next to the door)

One of my GA's heads over towards the door and I call him back ""dude

""yeah... but it's a cop....""
""I don't care if it's the pope man we DO NOT open the doors after hours

So I make eye contact with the cop (or maybe imposter

The next day I had to open (shitty schedules) and my ASM and I are working on distro, it's the cop from last night. awesome.

My ASM and I both kind of grin

During one sale period, I can't believe they're in the sale'. She turned to me to ask if we had them in a size 4. We usually just tell customers that all sale stock is out on the shop floor (which it usually is) but as she seemed so excited, I agreed to look in the stock room. Lo and behold, in the deepest recesses, I found a pair in a size 4. The woman was ecstatic and tried the shoes on. Her husband was sat down silent. She walked up and down the shop while her daughter oohed and ahhed, both of them laughing. She looked again at the price and said 'I can't believe these are such a bargain!'. She turned to her husband and asked him what he thought. Mr Previously Mute suddenly pipes up in a monotone voice 'They make your ankles look fat'. The atmosphere completely changed and the woman boxed up the shoes and handed them back to me, then promptly left. It made me really sad for the rest of the afternoon.

1373185807.0,1hsm9t,"""Yes, Officer, the store policy is clearly stated."" (adult store, NSFW)",K-hole,176, I work in a sex store. A sex store in a downtown metropolitan area that is fully stocked to (almost) every customer's wants and desires. We sell dance (stripper) clothes, DVD's and have a booth area for customers to either insert bills by the minute for preloaded movies or pay a set price to select a DVD from our stock.


As a shift manager I come in either mid-day or at night, irate, bitchy, or occasionally absolutely awesome customers. Expect me to be posting often.


Today I had a nice selection of irate. 3 stories from a Saturday


I come in the store around mid-day and before the door even shuts behind me the opener (we'll call him Jon) starts telling me about a near assault that happened not even an hour prior.


A customer came in, let me grab a dollar and I'll test it out (note: this is a common scam). The ""customer"" starts yelling at Jon, saying that Jon has worked here forever and knows the booths don't work. Jon calmly explains that, yes, sometimes they do malfunction, in which case we happily reimburse the customer, but it's customary to check the booth. At this point the customer starts yelling and becoming increasingly aggressive. Jon quickly heads back to the counter to be next to the cameras, follows him out and throws it at him.


So I get in


About 20 minutes later I'm working on processing new inventory and Jon is calming down a little bit. And then there's a bang on the windows. Alright, go back to my business. BANG. I go outside and there is a 6'3 drunk man with serious crazy eyes holding a brown bag and punching our windows.


""Hey. Stop hitting our windows.""


The 6'3 drunk crazy eye guy turns. ""what's it to you?"" He advances towards me


""I work here and stop hitting the fucking windows.""
""Oh


""call the cops for harassment


After that everything is going pretty smoothly. Have a nice couple come in


We do not do returns. We only do exchanges for defective items. This does not include shoes as some girls severely abuse their shoes or are only wanting to wear them with a specific outfit on a busy night. The only cases in which we waive the policy is if the customer called within 2 hours of purchase.


The dancer bought a pair of the most expensive boots we have. Black


She opens the box and shows me that the heel became detached from the platform and I say I'm sorry, and went on stage and got on the pole and they broke. And I don't care and repeat the policy. ""call the store manager.""


So I call her and explain the situation


""But they broke. And you're going to put my money back on my card.""
""No. I'm not going to do that. It is clearly posted that we do not do any returns at all
""I'm going to file a complaint with the better business bureau. I do this all the time."" And she smirks.


I realize that she's not going anywhere


I'm thanking her for saving me a phone call.

As stated earlier the police station is down the street and they get here pretty fast. One of the two officers I've dealt with before


He gives me an ""are you fucking serious look"" and I hope my look conveyed


She explains that we stole from her because we're not refunding her money. I explain that we have a strict no-exchange policy on shoes. 


""is it clearly stated?""
""yes


Both officers stare at her and now she claims she only tried them on. The officer I haven't dealt with before is left to explain that


She packs up her shoes in a hurry


Also, one day heel break like that one.

1374916799.0,1j5j2a,Feel good story. My cross dressing best customer (Long story but a GOOD one),Maevora06,826,173,83,"I worked at a young women's clothing chain. I was the assistant manager at the time and as such had to open the store sometimes. I usually closed because the manager worked days and would only work nights on the required day (Friday night). but company rules said I had to open 2 days a week so I got stuck with Wednesdays and Sundays. Which was fine with me because I was a night owl and Wednesdays were are slowest days and I often wouldn't even see a customer until noon. only down side was we rarely made our quotas on this day and would get ""talked to"" by our district manager frequently.

Well one morning an older man came in about an hour after we opened (maybe 50-60s

 He then started coming in every Wednesday morning and would buy an item or two. Over time he became more talkative. We would talk about things off topic a few times. it was a welcome reprieve since the mall was dead most Wednesdays and I worked alone on these days. After a month or so he started asking me for advice on clothes. Asking if his wife would like certain items. He asked if they would fit her claiming she was his exact height and about his body frame etc. Didn't think anything of it. Helped him pick out stuff for her aiming at clothes an older woman would wear (not our clothes aimed at teenage hookers lol)

I guess he became comfortable with me over time. One day while helping him try and pick out clothes he finally says ""Ok i have a confession. As much as sometimes these clothes are in fact for my wife. Most of it is for me"" I could see he was nervous about telling me and he waited for my reaction. So I go ""Oh ok...well

The next week he comes in and asks if he could try on stuff. I told him as long as there were no female customers who needed the fitting room it was ok but that if a female did come in he would need to come out and let her use it (I had asked my manager who asked the district ahead of time in case the question had popped up). He said he was perfectly ok with this as it was a female clothing store and we only had one fitting room area. Plus we were so dead this day of the week it was never a problem anyways. 

So the next week I get there to open my store and he is waiting outside with a platic bag. He had brought in his wig

He ended up being my best customer that year. He came in almost every Wednesday. The days he brought his whole get up

When it came time for me to leave he was devastated. i was joining the military and he panicked because he didn't know if he would be able to buy his clothes. Luckily the girl I was training to take my place was as open minded as I was. I told him she would be more than ok with his shopping and he would love her. So the next week I scheduled her to train during my Wednesday shift. I told her about him and she was so excited to be able to help him (she was a very excitable and energetic girl in the adorable way). When he came in that day he was very timid and nervous when he saw her. I told him to come in and meet her. He reluctantly came in. When I went to introduce her to him she cuts me off and goes ""OMG is this him?! Hi I am A***** I am so excited to meet you!"" he kinda looks at me but responds to her. She immediately took him away and began asking him questions and helping him pick out stuff. As I was watching I could see him relaxing as she went along. I knew he would be in good hands.

He asked me for my email when I left and for quite some time I received email correspondence from him. he would tell me how nice she was and how he still went in each week and bought stuff. The normal life stories and such. He was such a nice older man and I was so happy I could help him feel comfortable in his own skin. We've lost touch over the years and I still sometimes wonder how he is. I wish everyone could be so welcoming and understanding so people like him won't have to be ashamed of themselves. So glad my momma raised me so well and open minded &lt;3

**Religious Hypocrisy Abound!**

So it's another fine day, doing my LP thing.  Eventually, I end up at the *Follistar* brand store, and am in the back going over paperwork, investigating money shortages we've been having.  I have the stores camera's up in front of me, and from time to time I am taking sharp, eagle eyed glances at them

Too soon?

Anyways, ages roughly around 11,14, and 20+.  Nothing really drew my attention to them, but being the only people in the store, I figure I should watch them. The older guy and the 11 year old sit in the chairs in the front of the store, just chilling, and a few other flannels.  His mom has him try them on, bundle them up

Fantastic.

Now the normal downside to this, to the sales floor, without losing sight of the shoplifter.  If that happened, then I technically wouldn't be able to make a stop, as I couldn't 100% testify that they definitely did not ditch the stolen merchandise.  Luckily for me, she happened to be in the room right next to the door that leads to the back room. So I called a manager, and was able to get onto the floor quickly enough to ensure that she didn't ditch the stolen items.  My cover was obviously blown, and me and the other manager just walked around, so this woman just says ""No"" and starts trying to push her stroller, and not wanting to embarrass the woman

Now, but I would never do anything to risk a child's health. Fuck that, it's not worth it. 

So I calmly said, because if you're willing to risk your child's health to get away, I'm not going to be a part of that risk. But I don't care if I have to follow you to your car, get your plates, and have the police follow up. I'm getting my merchandise back, and you will have to deal with all that follows.""

She just kept dipping and dodging, kept trying to run interference.  I would just walk around him, and keep pace with the mom.  

At this point the mother is shouting ""IF YOU DON'T STOP FOLLOWING ME I'M CALLING THE COPS!"" to which I replied ""I'm already on the phone with the cops.""  I dialed them up and they had my managers call before, wherein the cat couldn't run and the mouse had down syndrome.

Who will win, push me, then take a swing.  NOPE.  So we are on the ground, the woman is screaming, and the older guy is standing over me as I'm holding his brother on the ground.  I tell them to get back.  Luckily the older guy had a cool head on his shoulders, and decided to step between the woman and I and keep her from jumping on me.  Just then the cops arrived, a whole 10 minutes after all of this nonsense began.  The cops cuffed the young boy and led the mother and him back to the store.  

Once inside, just saying ""I'm a good person, I'm a good Christian.""  The young kid is staring daggers at me.  The cops ask me if I want to press assault charges.  I look at him, and at the mother. 

I can't tell you why I did what I did. I can only tell you that I am an amazing, and when he stepped in front of me, we ran into each other, and I took it as a hands on thing when he pushed. I didn't tell them about the punch.  I think the cops knew, but realized I didn't want to put this poor kid through a trial when he was defending his mom.  Yes I am an amazing person with a trivial act of kindness. That means more Karma, right Reddit?  Upvote me damnit!

Ok enough sarcasm.  We recover the shirts from the baby stroller, and she explains that tomorrow is picture day at school, and her older son is the only one who works in the family. So they are struggling. She wanted her boy to have nice clothes, and this is the only way to get them right now.  She looks at me and says

""Good"" Christian Woman:  Thank you for not pressing charges on my son. He was just protecting me. They don't know I do this. Im ashamed.  But thank you for understanding and not making problems for him.  Please tell me what Church you go to

Me:  I understand. He just thought I was harassing you for no reason. Any good son would have done the same. But save your money Ma'm.  You obviously need it, so there's no church to donate too.  But it's a sweet sentiment.

Now I don't think that I have the words to properly convey the look that came across this woman's face. It was some sort of mixture between confusion, and incomprehension.  It honestly looked like I had just told her that if you kick a puppy through a field goal post, you'll find a pot of gold where it lands.  

Yes that is an awful image, and that's how this woman looked.

GCW: You do. You can't be moral without God.

M:.....

GCW: How can you trust Satan?

M: Ma'm I don't believe in Satan.  It kinda goes with the whole Atheist thing.

Now this was even more shocking to hear for her.  I guess she assumed that all atheist were devil worshipers

GCW:  I can help you.  If you let me just help you. Read the bible. I have so many I can give you one! Just open up to it.

M: Ma'm for the last time, I've read the Quran, Book of Mormon, Dhammapadda, and parts of several other religious texts from various religions and belief systems.  It's not an issue of ignorance.  But that is not why we are here. We are almost done if you just let us finish our paperwork, the officer here is going to release you on a PTA and you'll be free to go.

GCW: YOU NEED JESUS

First off, but we do have a lot of fancy shmancy Criterion movies and other critically acclaimed international titles that are hard to come by. Most of our customers are regulars, and a lot of them have been coming to our store for 15+ years. I am a petite, girly blonde in my mid-twenties. I love movies, and I love my job - but it doesn't pay extremely well.

This particular encounter happened roughly two years ago. It was during the summer, so I always ended up closing alone.

This all happened at about 9:30pm, he comes in, and immediately goes to the very back of the store where we kept all our blu-rays. Our shelves aren't very tall, so I can see his head poking through. I go back to work, and fifteen minutes later I realize that we're the only two people left in the store, and that he's still in the exact same spot in the blu-ray section, staring at me. I'm a little startled, see if maybe he needs help choosing a film or whatever.

When I finally approach him, but I know he's playing with something at the back of his pants, at waist level. I start to suspect he might be concealing a weapon, and that he's planning a hold-up.

I do my best to hide how scared I am and head back to the counter. I have the strength of a wet noodle, my boss hadn't deposited the money in the safe under the counter in over two weeks so I began to pray that this guy wouldn't ask me to open it. Because it isn't actually visible, I figured there was a chance he didn't know it was there so I did my best to conceal it entirely.
Finally, directly in front of me, I could tell he was holding something in his left hand and my heart sank. I looked at it, expecting to see a gun or a knife. Thankfully, it was just his penis. Just an average, semi-hard penis. I heaved a sigh of relief and began my closing routine.
The flasher seemed confused by my reaction, goodnight then?"". So I looked up at him, looked back down at his dick and said ""Yeah, whatever."" He seemed even more confused at this point and left quietly.

I called the cops, because I assumed my reaction disappointed him since I knew for a fact that it didn't get him fully hard. Wrong.
Two months later I am working a day shift by myself on a Wednesday. The flasher staggers in, see this? What's it say?"" I totally can't help side-eyeing him as I answer ""Draid?"" he ignores my obvious lack of interest and chuckles ""Yeah girl, that's my name! What's yours?"" I lie and say my name is Deborah ""Do you work here a lot, Deb?""

At this point, he's kind of shady and like, he said he comes here a lot... so uh... if he ever did anything shady in your store um... like, I wouldn't want you to think it was me... cuz I'm not shady... but my TWIN is..."" I think I actually snorted. ""Alright Draid, whatever. I do work here a fair amount and it's possible your twin came in while I was here but he clearly didn't make much of an impression."" He seemed disappointed by this, shrugged and said ""Oh... Ok... Well uh that's good..."" and pretended to look at movies for about five minutes before bolting out of the store.

Once more, he'd be discouraged. Sadly, he had more of a ""Challenge: Accepted!"" attitude.

I didn't work night shifts for a good six months after this

He walks in wearing his all-black outfit

He goes back to the same corner as he did the first time, and that my fucking boss STILL hadn't installed security cameras. All he did was give me a ""beatdown stick"" (it's a heavy, wooden table leg with sharp corners and a duct tape handle.)

I knew from experience that he'd still be staring at me so I looked up and made eye-contact. I glared at him. Since acting indifferent didn't work
I pulled out the beatdown stick and rested it over my shoulder like a baseball bat. I still wanted to scare him, all while exaggerating all of my reactions to it. I started yelling at the screen, like ""HAHAHAHA WHAT CRAZY MOTHERFUCKERS HAHAHA SO FUCKING HILARIOUS"" I made sure my laughter sounded fake and angry, and waved the beatdown stick a few times. It took about ten minutes but yeah, he ran out of the store FAST.

So, steal the game out of the box and then re-wrap the game with a shrinkwrapper using padding of some sort to make the game feel like the correct weight.

They always used to hit stores at the busiest times and always had a receipt so management used to authorise these without any further thought to actually checking if the game was actually in the case (Stupid I know).

Anyways. I was at work earlier this evening when 3 young boys came in - I’d say 9 - 11 years old. My coworker and I were keeping an eye on them because it’s retail and the little brats like to steal things. 

The store I work at isn’t exactly kid-friendly. There are a lot of risque items as well as items with vulgar language on them. Our card rack capitalizes on both these aspects quite well. One of the cards we sell is a birthday card with a woman holding a chalkboard so as to cover her insinuated nude breasts and genitalia; the chalkboard reads: 
&gt;Menu:

&gt;*  Large

&gt;* Smokin’ hot buns 

&gt;* Whipped cream for dessert.

The boys glanced over the card to pick up a mug covered in various curse words

At this point

They returned to the aforementioned card, “This bitch deserves what’s coming to her. Slut.”

They then wandered around the womens’ clothing section for a bit, she’s begging for the D if she wears this.” “God, anyone who wore this would open their legs for anything!” etc.

They soon left, they were playing keep-away with the smallest boy’s Hulk hat. After being told twice to not run, I  crouched to their level and told them, “Listen. One, we said to not run. Two, this isn’t a playground. Three, you were in here earlier making absolutely inappropriate remarks about girls.

She had always been a very pleasant person, and the husband and kids always seemed friendly enough.

Anyway, no ""please"", no ""thank you"". Weird. 

I take them their drinks, apparently she wanted me to pick the foil off the neck of the wine bottle. That bit of foil that nobody takes off because it doesn't obstruct your wine-drinking in any way.

Their food comes out and I take it to them. Again, she ordered a calzone without ever having had one before and apparently just didn't like the concept of it. She wants to exchange it for a pepperoni pizza. Fine. I go back to the table to take the calzone away... she'd eaten two-thirds of it!

Our store was run well, the store manager was a reasonable man and was best friends with the mens department manager (my manager), the employees here were intelligent and fun to be around. We were the highest selling store in our state. It was a magical place to work, I loved every minute of it.

A year ago I was offered a promotion to manager. Housewares needed a new manager, no joke. I was overwhelmed and had a lot of anxiety over this, but, everything worked out.

As manager I began noticing how different management was to being a lowly worker. Lot of drama, and he plays dumb saying it was a mistake.

One night, I saw that the slushie machine had been left running and there was now a waterfall of glacier blue rasperry cascading from the drip tray into a vast pool of blue on the floor I had just finished mopping.  

So I turned it off, to to mop it up, and went back into the office to wile away my precious off-time watching the closed circuit security camera.  As I suspected, one of the teenagers proceeded to place something from our shelves into his coat pocket and leave the store.  I stopped him as he left, asked him to come back in and hand me the stolen merchandise - a bottle of No-Doz.  

I brought him to the back room, just this once, he would never ever ever do it again.  I knew he was full of shit, but I guess I felt kind of sorry for him, so I decided to cut him a break and call his parents instead of the police.  Whay can I say?  I'm a push over.

His mom, her exact words were ""Then I suggest you call the police.""  As I hung up the phone, I felt even sorrier for the kid, but I knew that letting it slide would do him no favors.  ""Sorry,"" I said.  ""Your mom said to call the police.""  And I did.

When the cop showed up, picked up the No-Doz and held it inches from the kid's face.

""See this?"" he asked.  ""It's $4.99.  Now you're in handcuffs.  You're stupid.""

About two years ago I was doing my cleanup, tables, floor, saw, with a very powerful and toxic if ingested soap. A customer came up to the counter and asked my to cut up the whole fryer chicken she had into parts. Normally, I would have been happy to oblige, but since the tables were covered in this foam I told her that I was unable to. She then proceeded to tell me that it was my job to do this, I laugh at her tell her I'm not going to help her and that she can go talk to a manager. I turn my back to her as she storms off to complain.
Of course the manager comes flying up to me and asks what happened. I pointed out the toxic chemicals and said that I was unable to cut the bird for her and I was not going to put up with being screamed at by a customer for not making her sick. So he goes gives her a heaping amount of gift cards and sends her on her way. And from there I thought it was over, ""okay sure I'll cut the chicken next time, but I have a question for you. Would you guys like a multi-million dollar lawsuit on your hands, because I'm fairly sure poisoning a customer is a good way to go about getting one. I understand where you are coming from, but I have never provided poor customer service and as far as I am concerned I saved this company millions of dollars and a heck of a lot of embarrassment. So next time, if I am getting you guys, I'll go ahead and poison her. Who's contact info should I give out to her when she wants to sue?"" Everyone went silent. A lot of mumbling and repeating stuff about customer service ensued until they were done at which point I thanked all the managers by name for their time and went to go do my job.

I'll set the scene first:
I worked in a high end UK supermarket chain on the Deli Counter (cooked meats
I was one of 3 guys who worked all day on the counter on Sundays
All the counters (Deli, and one assistant manager. But they only work one Sunday a month each.
So every other weekend we run it ourselves

This system worked, and i was happy as i doubled my wages through my own hard work. I got the role ""3rd Hand"". a Regular employee with manager roles to do when they weren't in.(after Deparment managers and Assistant Managers).

Now

I got on with all managers except one
He's a pain in the ass and hates young clever kids because he fucked his own youth up.

Now

Our Store is the only one in 5 miles with a back-up generator (dont want to lose stock). 

And we sell hot chickens. The only hot food available that day. For 5 Miles.

I got to work EARLY (5AM) to take a van to 2 other stores too small to have generators
I get back to my store and ""spike"" them all ready for rotisserie roasting and crank up the ovens to full.
We get to opening time (10 am) and ive got 10 ovens ready to go
Its now McTache comes in

This will be fun.

I got the paperwork for the stock transfers done and gave it to him.

McT: ""What the hell is this?!""

Me:  ""we'll i took thier stock because today were the only way people can get a hot dinner""

McT: ""oh. yes. good work""


Geez


Now we proceeded to do immense business for the day


I work my arse off until 3pm, serve chickens. Then the last oven come out.
We close at 4


McTache approaches.
McT: ""what are you doing?""

Me:  ""erm

McT: ""put more in the oven"" (80 minute cook time

Me:  ""no


ok

McT: ""did you call me stupid?!"" McTache is getting his angry on.

I took my hat off, you wont sell them, thats *epic mental maths* a loss of £60 of stock and £120 profit.""

McT: ""I AM THE DSM. MY WORD IS LAW. PUT THE CHICKENS ON NOW"". fuck hes mad.

Me:  ""no chance

I walked off
I got my paperwork done
He comes over and starts screaming at me:
""If you'd put them on when i said we'd have sold them. This is all your fault

Awww hell. The chickens get sold to staff for 50p at a loss. Worst, and i'd already put in 3 more hours that morning.

The next day at my monday evening shift i get called into the Store Managers office.
The Store Manager was a very reasonable lady

SM: ""I hear you had an argument with McT yesterday over the chickens.""

Me: ""yeah . . .""

SM: ""That you called him stupid infront of other staff and customers""

Me: ""Yeah . . .""

SM: ""That you disobeyedd the Daily Store Manager and ignored him""

At this point i am thinking i am in it now. I can't deny any of it

SM: ""Did you know we made record money yesterday because we had hot food from you on offer?""

Me: ""i thought we would

SM: ""a stock transfer you weren't authorised to make""

Me: ""yeah"" - the dead feeling creeps in now.

SM: ""well, and abused the oher staff by shouting at them. We want to thank you for your actions and reward you.""

Me: ""wait

SM: ""The store is a partnership, were giving you a case of Jack Daniels as a thankyou for yesterday and the unpaid time you put in.""

I am happy now

SM continues: ""and we're sending McT on an anger management course and he's on Disciplinary.""

Justice is served.

Next sunday McT is forced to come over and apologise to me
Felt good to stick to my guns and win.

**Introduction:**  I work for a security company whose uniform is a blue polo shirt with a brightly stitched yellow badge on it and black dress slacks. After my shift, ""Hey! You work here, right? You need to come see this!"" He sounded genuinely concerned so I didn't bother correcting him and instead followed him out of the store. There, right on front of a gathering group of people, was car that had just caught on fire.

**Act I:**  I only wanted to look at tablets but suddenly there's this whole situation unfolding and walking away just isn't an option, pick one person and tell them to do it *even if* someone else *may* have already done it. 911 doesn't care how many people call in to report one emergency.]

While she starts to use her phone for something productive, why the hell are so many people walking *toward* this thing?) and finally the Loss Prevention lady gets back to me to report that the local Fire Dept is on their way. I'm about to ask her to help me keep people from getting close but she immediately disappeared. I spend the next five minutes trying to keep moronic motorists from driving literally *right by* the blaze that has now engulfed the front third of this sedan before the FD shows up and immediately gets to work.

**Act II:**  Thinking I was essentially done, well, I can do that. When you're a first-responder, you inherit all the responsibilities of overseeing the situation until appropriate people show up, and so far, no Best Buy manager has come outside to help.

So I go into Best Buy and try to use their PA system to call out the license plate of the van in an attempt to find the owner, there's no beep. So I tell him and he gets even more of an attitude with me, giving me a look that said *How stupid are you?* He turns the phone around to me and tells me what numbers to press and I do it myself. Luckily it worked, even though there never was a beep, and I moved on to making the same announcement in every store up and down that strip mall, just in case the owner of the van had gone into a different store. I never did find the owner.

**Epilogue:**  Finally I reported back to the Fire Chief and the police officer who showed up. Everything was long under control so they didn't need me any more and I went back inside the Best Buy to resume my shopping. After a couple minutes, you don't work for us do you?"" The look on his face was priceless and he felt so bad that he offered to buy me a Dasani. Hey, it wasn't much but I took it and left without buying anything because really, at that point, I wasn't interested in being there anymore.

TL;DR: Repeatedly mistaken for a Best Buy employee, and then get an attitude from an employee for not knowing how to work their intercom.

So I work in a petrol station. I'm unaware of the rules regarding mobile phone usage in other countries or in other petrol stations but at my one in particular the use of mobile phones is prohibited. I don't know why; all I know is I can't authorise a pump if someone is using a mobile phone (same goes for smoking a cigarette

So I'm working one day with an older co-worker (hereby referred to as 'D') of mine. She gets flustered easily and can't handle prickish customer very well. This guy rolls up in a BMW (hereby referred to as 'BMW')

* BMW: ""Phones don't even affect pumps.""
* D: ""You cannot use your phone while dispensing fuel.""
* BMW: ""Show me where in this place it says that.""
* D: ""It says it on all the pumps and it says it in here also. I cannot authorise a pump if you're using your mobile phone.""
* BMW: ""Listen to me
* D: ""I am not chastising you all I'm saying is...""
* BMW: ""Yes you are. I pay your fucking wages

He then proceeded to write D's name on a piece of paper. At this point I felt the need to chime in.

* Me: ""You wanna calm down there?""
* BMW: (He points) ""Mind your own business.""
* Me: ""You can't use your phone while using a pump
* BMW: ""And how am I meant to know that?""
* Me: ""There are signs at every pump
* BMW: ""I don't have to take lectures from the likes of you
* Me: ""Away you go then.""
* BMW: ""What did you just say to me?""
* Me: ""You don't want to take lectures from the 'likes of me'? Away you go then.""
* BMW: ""And what's your name?"" (He starts squinting at my nametag)
* Me: (I hold up my nametag) ""My name is [full name] and you're not getting served today. Away you go.""

He leaves and drives off. What appeared to be his wife was sitting in the passenger seat and she looked like she was a little embarrassed. A customer who was waiting to be served laughed at him on his way out.

By taking our names he seemed to be threatening to lodge a complaint or something. It's been a few days since this happened and no complaint has been lodged.

It seems a bit odd, EMTs, ER nurses and doctors, race volunteers, and military personnel who all immediately responded to this horrible attack.  No panic, no hesitation, just an immediate reaction to the call for aid.  You guys and gals are the best.  To the victims and people of Boston

The store attached to our station was a fairly large one.  Several aisles of snack food and basic consumables (TP, etc) along with your standard issue roller grill, microwave, half-a-dozen coffee pots, and a huge cooler full of soda, milk, and beer.  Lots of beer.  This IS Oregon

That beer was a thorn in my side as a cashier.  Bored rich kids thought it would be fun to try and grab-n-go with it, and it was a constant battle against them in order to keep from getting fired or possibly arrested.  Everyone in town knew I was a stickler for the rules.  This guy, however, tried anyway.

A car drives in and parks right in front of the store.  I can see out our full glass door into the car, and heads straight for the beer cooler.  Great, I'm going to have to deal with this.  He gets his cell phone out, and makes a call.  I can see the driver answer HIS phone, and it's pretty obvious that they are conversing back and forth.  So the guy in the store, let's call him Sergei, comes up to the register with a half-rack of Coors Light, and two six-packs of Mikes Hard Lemonade.  Oh

""Sir

He begins reaching for his wallet.

""...and the IDs for everyone in the car.""

Oregon has a shoulder-tapping law.  This means that, I have to see EVERYONE'S ID or else I could get fined about $5,000 and potentially charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor.  This, of course, does not sit well with Sergei.  He first insists that they are all 21.  Doesn't matter, still have to see ID.  He then insists that all the beer is for him.  Doesn't matter, still have to see ID.  Then he complains that other cashiers have done it for him (yeah, still need to see ID.

Now Sergei's gone from begging/joking to angry.  He starts rambling on about how he knows the owner and the owner would do it for him.  Dude, since the owner was the one who gave the cashiers their OLCC training *because he's certified to do so,* I highly doubt it.  Finally, Sergei DEMANDS that I call the owner at home, and get him down to the station to clear this up.

No.  Just, at 9pm, just to interrupt his family time, have him drive 20 minutes down to the station, just so he call tell you you're an idiot and kick you out.  I like the owner.  And before you ask, no, I'm not calling the general manager or any of the assistant managers.  I'm in charge right now

But Sergei's heels are firmly dug into the ground like a cartoon donkey.  He's gone into the ""repeat the same thing over and over again"" bit, and tell Sergei I'm going to make a call.  ""FINALLY, JUST DO WHAT I ASK!"" he bellows.  Oh, my friend, that's not quite the case.

Yes, so I went into the back room.  Instead of calling the owner, I called, you guessed it, the local constabulary.  Would you be so kind as to send over one of your fine officers to deal with a young rapscallion who's attempting to purchase intoxicating beverages with the intent to distribute them to potential minors?  You would?  Oh, marvelous, see you soon!

I come back out of the stock room and tell Sergei that someone will be here soon, and lights up a cigarette.  Sadly, he was facing away from me when the police car rolled up and parked behind his car, so I couldn't see his facial expression.  More's the pity, I'm sure it was priceless.

The officer steps out, and asks the driver and two girls to step out.  He then ushers all four of them inside.  The girls look nervous, the driver looks pissed, and Sergei looks in shock.  I manage to keep a victory grin from spreading across my face.  An effort of will that was, let me tell you.

The officer then asks why he got called down here on a complaint that someone was trying to buy beer without showing ID.  Sergei counters saying he DID show me ID.  The officer then looks at me.  ""No, come inside, and call the driver, sir.  You definitely came in the car.""  Sergei then gets angry, calls me a liar, and was probably thinking of trying to come over the counter at me when the officer calls it all to a halt.  ""How about this, ladies and gentlemen.  Let me see everyone's ID.""

They all very reluctantly pull out IDs.  Sergei is 24.  The driver is 23.  Girl #1 is 17.  Girl #2 is 16.  Uh-oh.

So the entire troupe is herded back outside, that AM is the one I'm in classes with, he'd love to help out an investigation.  I give him a quick call, and he's at the station within 2 minutes.  He and the officer go into the back room and watch the tape.  The beer is slowly getting warm on the counter.  I'm getting bored.

The officer comes back out, and promptly arrests both Sergei and the driver.  Neither are very happy about it, but don't put up any sort of fight, just shouting and vague threats towards me and the station.

The girls were the icing on the justice cake.  The officer made them call their parents so they could be picked up

Finally, and left.  The next day, I had a $100 gas card and a nice little note in my employee file.  Never heard from Sergei or his friend again.

One night during the summer about 15 minutes before we locked up we had 3 men come in (they were probably in their mid to late 30’s) and ordered ice cream. By the time we had finish serving them it was time for me to lock the door so I was surprised when they noticed that and decided to take their dessert outside to our patio (at this time I was thinking we had some great guys on our hands).

I asked one of my employees to go outside and wipe the windows down, restaurants, and coffee houses so we didn’t ever really have issues with people doing weird shit. Today was not one of those days.

I was counting my drawers and safe when two of my coworkers come into the back and one appears to be comforting the other one who once I noticed was clearly upset. I asked what was wrong and I was informed that the clients who had so kindly gone outside to eat decided the best thing to do in a situation where a 16 year old girl was cleaning around them was talk to her about how pretty she was

Let me pause right here and say that I was raised in a household where I was the youngest of 3. My two older siblings are both female and as such I have been raised to expect certain things from myself as well as my male counterparts when interacting with women. Like how women are actually people.

Anyways… I was pretty pissed so I told her I would handle it. She asked me not to

So I give a phone to one of the other people on shift and tell them that if anything happens to call 911. I go outside and turn to these guys and tried my best to tear them a new one.

It was the hottest part of the summer, assistant manager, regional director, and the district manager. Since it was my shift, I had been keeping a partial ear open in case there were any emergencies. 

There is a tone, it signals warning. It is before the yelling starts, but has the same terseness that a girl will use when their guy is in hot water. I heard this tone coming through the wall, but since a lead (lowest management level) was there I didn't go rushing out. Almost immediately an employee pops their head in the door and says, ""fireball03, we need you out here, NOW"" 

It was the look on their face that made me race to the counter. When I got there I saw her. She was obese, you could tell, had an awful day.

I went up with my friendliest smile to try and figure out the situation. Whenever I have an angry guest I introduce myself and inform them of my position so that they know I am in a position to help. Having seen her situation I was ready to fix anything I could to hopefully make her day a little better. Instead AG (angry guest) said this.

Me: Hi, let's figure out what's going on ( i hadn't been told the issue at this point)

AG: You work here?

Me: Yes I do

AG: You can't help me

Me: Well I am his boss

AG: No

I turned to the lead and gave him an encouraging nod and took a step back. After a little back and forth it turns out that she didn't like the product. She had already seen the product before she bought it. Since these are personalized we can't do returns without supervisor authorization.

Lead: (to me) am I allowed to do that?

AG: Why are you asking her

Lead: She's my boss and I can't do returns

At this time the management meeting was over and they were all coming out. The walls are paper thin so they heard everything.

AG:(to the group) Can one of you help me?

DM: Sorry fireball03 is in charge you'll have to ask her

I used to work a tech support desk at a big electronics retailer. Part of our job there was to handle service plan claims, the customer then had to pay $25 to get the item back. We even had said customers sign a disclaimer to this effect. Still, every time an item came back NFF, we would get a large argument. This is why we insisted on testing EVERY SINGLE ITEM thoroughly before sending it out, that way we could verify that yes, indeed there was a problem. Most of the time, however, the customer would still insist that we send it out.

On top of the normal daily arguments we would get, i will call him Bob from here on out, had dropped off his DVD/VCR combo about a week before, claiming that it did not work. At the counter it was tested, but the Bob wouldn't even describe a problem, just saying that it didn't work over and over. We plugged it in, played both disks and VHS tapes, just to prove that it did, he still insisted that it didn't work and that we needed to send it out. So we did, and spent the better part of 20 minutes explaining to him that if/when the item comes back NFF

Fast forward one week. The DVD/VCR had been received that morning, need to pay the $25 to pick the item up, as they could not find a single problem with the device in question. This night it was myself and one other associate (we shall call him Dave), who happened to be working the counter when Bob walked in. Dave greeted Bob fairly nicely and took his receipt and went and found the device. He then informed Bob, yet again, that the item came back with NFF and is, in fact, Bob was appalled. ""What $25???? I'm not paying that shit! You fixed it, well with in the customers reach.

I spotted this, and peer in to see if we were watching. I quickly reacted, walked over and put my hands on the item, hoping i had caught it before Bob had fully formed the idea to run. I greeted Bob nicely, and then tried to diffuse the situation, explaining the $25 again, and also reminding him that i was the one that tested the item for him originally, he was not going to back down on this issue. Bob starts to yell that he wants his unit, i was a little too slow. Bob's ninja like hands dart out and grab hold of the other end of the device, and that i cant release it to him. He yells to give it to him

Unfortunately, and a lack of something to do with his hands. So of course he did the only logical thing with them that he could think of and reached out for my neck. Here i am, being strangled over a counter by a 6 foot tall 50 something man, and all i could do was yell out. Luckily the guy working at the LP desk was close enough to run over and tackle old Bob to the ground.

You can guess the next few bits, the reports, court, etc. The best part was before the police would take him out of the store, they dragged him over to the counter and made him pay the $25! Turns out that Bob was out on parole for assault, and obviously had just violated. Just another fun time at the service desk!

TL;DR: Don't leave things alone on a counter where a customer can grab it if there is a dispute!

The second Sticky Hands walked into the store, then the quilt, then the sheets, every sham, and threw each item into a pile in the middle of the bed as she “inquired” about it. After the bed was completely stripped, she asked where the sale bedding was, and I told her the back of the store. I was waiting until she was out of ear shot to warn the guys in the back, and was quicker on the walkie talkie.

Larry: Hey Moe and Curly, but you watch her like a hawk. She’s a thief.

Larry was actually supposed to be off the clock at that time, but after about thirty minutes, Curly was getting annoyed. Moe had been doing a good job of not getting distracted. She was using the walkie to call for everything from stock to price checks, and never took her eyes off the woman. Curly came over the walkies and said, “This is ridiculous! She obviously isn’t buying anything, and she’s wasting all of our time!”

Oh Curly

Me: Curly, then return. She’s done at least $1300 worth of fraudulent returns that I know of. Do not leave that section. In fact, if everyone can be in that section, all the better.

Apparently Larry told him the same thing.

Abbott and Curly then decided the only displays that needed to be worked on were those in bedding, Sticky was asking bullshit questions about the bedding, and saying things like, “Go check in the back for this. Go in the back and check the price.” etc etc. Once all four were in the back, anything she asked, they all answered with different answers.

Sticky: Does this come in a queen?

Moe: Full/Queen.

Costello: No.

Abbott: I’m a queen! (Also

Curly: They’re right behind you.

Every now and then Moe would call over the headset, can you price check [item].” I told her $500 no matter what she asked. She made up random numbers.

This went on for about thirty minutes before Sticky finally admitted defeat and bought a sale duvet. This should be the end of the story

Sticky and the rest of the Hands family went out the “back” door, and they couldn’t get anything because he was so worthless. She then walked in the front door and directly up to my counter. She wanted to do a return. -.- Fine.

As I’m returning her item, “No! I want to keep the bag!”

Me: Sorry

Sticky: That’s bullshit! What if I need that bag!?

Me: For what?

Sticky: Other stores!

Me: I’m pretty sure other stores also have bags.

Me: More bullshit than returning something less than five minutes after buying it?

Sticky: What the hell are you trying to say!?

Me: You know exactly what I’m saying.

Sticky: This is bullshit! You racist! I’m never coming back!

I finished processing her return as she thought of a hundred and one ways to tell me she was never coming back, “Say anything you want to her, we’ll all back you up.” Oh god. Don’t give me that kind of permission!

I work at this fairly well known amusement park a couple miles from my hometown. I'm a ride operator so part of my job is to put the wristbands on the kids after we've checked their height. This normally takes the hassle out of getting your child's height checked at every ride that they go to. It's a great idea for those who don't want to wait in line for two hours and find out their kid is too short to ride. One of the rides I work at requires you to be 54 inches to ride - no less. 

So this white woman and her two small girls come walking up to my stand to get wristbands. The two girls both have HIGH HEELS on because they know that they are not going to be tall enough for the rides they want to get on so they're trying to cheat the system. I measure one of the girls with her heels on because she fell into the 48 inch range with or without the heels on. The other girl was about 50 inches without her heels on but was 54 with them on. So I tell her to take her shoes off so that I can't measure her without them. 

Me: ""Alright

The mother looks at her daughter and then looks at me. The daughter looks like she's about to cry because she knows that she's not going to be tall enough without them. 

Mother: ""Yeah

I am shocked because I have never been called racist before and I'm thinking what kind of sheltered life do you live that anything a black person does to you that doesn't seem fair is racist. She says she wants to speak to my manager and I say I can call him for you and she just storms off to talk to the manager from the places that takes photos of people in the park. He literally has nothing to do with this situation but tells me to give her the 54 inch wrist band anyway. He kept looking at me the entire time like I was the one in the wrong and agreeing with all her BS about how I was being racist. I think he may have been trying to get her to leave but even so - I still don't see how I did anything wrong. 

These wristbands are for your kids safety. Not because we want to be mean. My ride has a strict 54 inch requirement because the harness around you has to be able to lock around your body. It does not have a floor to it so it makes the requirement necessary. I just can't believe the people that get upset over this kind of thing.

1376021235.0,1k085j,You want to get me fired? How about I get you fired instead?,DeathByCarousel,705,110,36,"I did three years of retail. I am glad I am out of it. This is a little long and I am a little drunk

My story begins when I started working for that telecomm company. 

I was hired as an operations specialist, among other things. Besides me, there were about 6-8 sales people and a manager, all hired under a contractor, meaning we were not directly hired by Big Telecomm. 

The story deals with the manager, arriving late and leaving early on most of his shifts, taking conference calls in which he'd be so angry about ""our numbers"" that he'd slam his fist on the desk or throw his pens around, and announcing that there were customers in the store. I'm serious, he went from ""Customer, customer"", to ""Consumer, to ""Guest

Fucking sad

One of the things about my job that I hated was dealing with money. We never dealt with money, not cash. In the extremely rare event that we took cash, I'd just fill out a form, put the cash in an envelope and hand it to the armored truck guy.

Here's where things went downhill. Bill got hired as an employee of Big Telecomm

At one point

Bill somehow made a rule that every remote that was sent out should cost a penny because ""by law we shouldn't be giving stuff out for free"". So the sales people were literally charging a penny for a free remote

This became a problem because we started to pile up on pennies, just a bunch of pennies in a box and no one would notice.

After a year and a half and a bunch of accumulated PTO, when one of my coworkers who was also one of my best friends called me and told me, ""Bill is trying to get you fired"".

I asked her why, Bill's responsibility was to make sure that all deposits were sent in, and he was the one that told me that the pennies should not be deposited and just left in the safe considering how many there were.

I was not there to defend myself, and our closet was full to the brim because we were not getting enough boxes in to send them out, and Bill's job was to order those boxes, which he virtually never did.

When I return back to work, just doing my thing. The managers for the contractors, Mike, comes in and makes small talk with me and out of nowhere, he throws ""So DeathByCarousel, I really need another rep at our kiosk in this location, I really think you should take the position...""

Now mind you

We go out, that he spoke to his bosses about getting me fired, but since I was a contractor, he couldn't fire me directly. Technically, Mike was there to fire me, but he told me that Bill was using me as a scapegoat for his incompetence and he was giving me the only two choices I had, which was to transfer to another place and work as a salesman. Or be fired.

Again

Bill comes up right next to me and asks ""Are the rumors true? That you're transferring?"". I was so pissed off

So I leave.

Now for the good part.

____________________________________________________

Not two weeks after I am doing my thing at the new place

He tells me that there are four or five employees

Of course I agree.

The day comes and I'm sitting in front of Bill's bosses. I tell them about Bill's anger issues when it comes to conference calls or when the numbers are just a little too low. I tell them about how Bill made a comment about how he got a gun and he could easily kill everyone in our team without emptying the chamber. I tell them about how when one of the sales reps fell asleep on the back after closing time, use of profanity with all the reps, inappropriate comments, and how I was used as the scapegoat for the clusterfuck with the safe and the returns. So many things that I don't even remember it all.

They thanked me for my time

Two days later, yelling on his phone, and as soon as he walked in, he was pulled into the office to resign his badge and that he was done, and not to come back since he was banned from the store.

Serves you right

Thanks for reading.

Me: ""STORENAME

Me: ""Of course
*We had a back room where our fitting rooms were

I told him my name
I didn't think anything of it, or bought some items and returned the ones that didn't work.  Because we were a plus sized store, our clothes were obviously bigger and longer which would fit more men, than having them shop in a clothing store that had smaller sizes.  I continued to organize various things as we were very slow in the mornings.
About 30 minutes later an older gentleman with bright white hair

MOP: ""Are you... Cassiethesassy?""

Me: ""Yes

MOP:  ""Yes

Me:  ""Not a problem

We continued to talk about what he was looking for.  He was on a budget, I escorted him to our clearance section and decided he would fit best in a 1X size.  He picked out a few that he liked and asked if he could try them on.  I obliged as we had no other customers in the store.  I unlocked the farthest fitting room (just in case we did get another customer), and as I let him in with the items he said: ""Will you stick around and give me your opinion?""

Me: ""Sure

I let him get settled and when I heard my name I knew he had the first dress on.  
He had picked some rather, stuffed bra on and matching red panties.  Everything was covered, but needless to say, I learned a pretty good poker face that day!
He tried on about 4 different dresses and decided on a green, hands me a $10 bill and says: **""Wow, I wish I had a girlfriend as nice as you.""**

Needless to say
He paid for the dress, hey!  $10!!

I came to the US when I was 9 years old with my parents from the former USSR

When I was 17 I got my first (official) job as a cashier at ShopRite. For those not on the east coast of the US

So, I bag their shit, I tell them how much money they spent, and they give me money to stuff the register. 

At some point this Russian woman and her 20ish year old son get in my lane. I finish ringing up the customer before them and the following conversation ensues.

&gt; *Me: (To previous customer) Have a nice day.*

&gt; *Me: (To Russian woman) Do you have a ShopRite card?*

&gt; *Woman: No.*

&gt; *Me: Do you have any coupons or rain checks?*

&gt; *Woman: No.*

I then begin scanning her groceries. Note that as far as she's concerned

&gt; *Woman: (to her son) Посмотри что этот идиот делает. (Translation: Look at what this idiot is doing)*

I glance up trying to find the idiot she is talking about. Perhaps something funny is going on?

&gt; *Woman: Почему он здесь работать? Бог Я ненавижу идиотов. (Translation: Why is he even working here? God I hate idiots.)*

At this point I realize she is talking about me. Mind you, and putting them aside to bag later. I'm not banging them or taking a long time or anything. I was doing a pretty decent job of it actually. 

I begin to run the situation in my head and decide that it's best to just continue working and ignore the woman... for now. So I put on my best smile and keep scanning her shit.

&gt; *Woman: Сколько это еше займет? (Translation: How long is this going to take?)*

I finish ringing up all her stuff

&gt; *Woman: Он даже не знает как правильно упаковать. Ой

She managed to throw in a few more insults my way

&gt; *Me: Как вы будете за это платить? (Translation: How will you be paying for this?)*

The woman stops dead in her tracks, under the circumstances. Her son even took a step back. After what must have felt like an eternity for her, she hung her head in shame and handed me her credit card. I rang her up, handed her the credit card back, and handed her son the remaining groceries. Both of them are completely red in the face at this point and both refuse to say anything. Their eyes are firmly locked on to the floor. As they leave, I smile at them again and say:

&gt; *Me: Большое спасибо. Пожалуйста

Now the cherry on the icing happened almost 6 months after the incident. The son happened to get on my line with whom I assume was his father. They were speaking Russian to each other and didn't pay much attention to me. But I recognized the son. After I was done scanning their things

&gt; *Me: Я вас помню. Как вы поживаете? (Translation: I remember you. How are you doing?)*

**S**: I dont want to sell you tickets as the lift isnt running due to the weather conditions and no CocaisBauer isnt lieing to you. 

**C**: You are just lazy assholes that dont want to run the lift. I want to go sledding with my family so sell us the tickets!

**A**: That would be 65 USD

**C**: Here you go and next time dont try to fool me just because you are lazy!

**A**: Here is your change and have a nice vacation! Bye!


He leaves with his family towards the base station of the gondola lift around 200m away from the cashier office. 


I walk back to my supervisor and ask her why we sold him tickets. She tells me he wanted the tickets so we sold them. I could keep the money from the sale and if he comes back I should direct him to her. Around 30minutes later I sit back at my register and can already see the guy stomping down from the base station of the gondola towards my register. I wait patiently and smile at him while I look at him coming towards me. 

**C**: You are all lazy assholes that dont want to run the lift! I want my money back for the tickets! 

**A**: One minute please

**C**: You better do so


*I get my supervisor and I am eager to know what will happen now* 


**S**: You wanted the tickets even after we told you that the lift isnt running. You insulted CocaisBauer and no you wont get your money back!

**C**: This is outrageous! I demand to get my money back or else I will never come back to this region again!

**S**: You wont get your money back!

**C**: You are a stupid bitch and your cashier is a lazy asshole that wont achieve anything! I come here for my vacation and I should be treated better!

So it's another day at GDNickels.  My partner Stacy is on the cameras, and accompanied by a younger girl who looks maybe 10 or so.  Stacy had already seen then place some fashion jewelry on top of the hood of the baby basket, and then cover them with some shirts they selected. So while its concealment, its one of those situations where it doesn't mean they are going to steal the items.  We see people place items there all the time. Sometimes as convenience and sometimes as a way to steal.  Either way it warrants watching. We knew we had a real case on our hands when they folded the hood up, pretending to coo at the baby inside.  Now all the items were concealed inside the stroller.  The two girls walked around, before finding a corner of the store where they quickly reach into the folded hood of the stroller, and shoved the clothes into a baby bag. They then proceeded to head to the exit of the store.  

Stacy and I met them at the exit, like most shoplifters, she tried to lie her way out of it.  What makes this story different is the amount of lies fed to us, and the sheer stupidity of them.  So we will call this girl Dig Dug, or DD for short.

So we are in the office, and several pairs or shirts and jeans from other stores, all without a receipt.  Now in the bag is one of those plastic containers containing baby wipes.  I open it up and taped to the inside is DD's license.  And sure enough, her name is not ""Yolanda"".  So I turn to the younger girl and ask how she knows ""Miranda"".

DD: Miranda's a nickname.

M: I see. Then who is [Insert Real Name from license here]?

DD: Never heard of her.

M: Well thats funny cuz there is a drivers license hidden in the baby wipes with your picture and that name.

DD:  I've never seen that in my life. You planted it there.

Me and Stacy shared a glance and started to laugh

M: So I planted a fully ready license with your picture and false info

DD: I bought those clothes.

M: I'm sure you bought all these other clothes in this bag from the other stores too?

DD: Yea we were returning them.   ::Shoveling Noises::


M: Listen

DD:  Yes. 

M: That wasn't so hard.  Now is this girl really your niece?

DD: Yes.

M: Well we don't have any way of verifying that until the cops show up.

DD, and tells her to stay seated unless she wants to get cuffed. Stacy then explained that the cops are coming because she stole clothes.

DD: But they just fell in there!   ::Shoveling Noises::


M: We have you on camera.

DD: So then you can see they just fell in there.   ::Shoveling Noises::


M: So you want us to believe, and common sense tells us, that the clothes and jewelry somehow fell into your baby bag. Despite the fact that they are in different parts of the store. Despite the fact that the bag was closed, and despite the fact that the bag was underneath your stroller?

DD:.....

M: Listen

DD: DON'T SWEAR IN FRONT OF MY BABY AND NIECE!

M: DON'T STEAL IN FRONT OF YOUR BABY AND NIECE!

At this point the baby started crying

While we were waiting

M: These other clothes from these other stores

DD: No we bought them early.   ::Shoveling Noises::


M: Well why are they in your baby bag and not in a store bag? And wheres the receipt?

DD: We spilt soda.  [OK FUCK THE SHOVELS. WE ARE GONNA NEED A BACK HOE UP IN HERE. Catepillar bitches!]

M: Umm.....oooook.  Spilt soda. And....?

DD: Yea so we had to throw the bag and receipt out.

M: Because the soda ruined them?

DD: Yes.  I promise

M:  Then why are the shirts neither wet nor stained?

DD:  We got them out in time.

M:  Why are you lying?

DD: I swear. If I stole them I'd have removed the store tags off of them.

M: You didn't remove the tags off of our shirts...

DD: Well I didn't steal them.

M: Listen, in handcuffs to the stores, and ask if they saw your purchase these. If they didn't, you'll be charged there as well. But if you tell me now, we will just return them to the store and save you the extra charges.

DD: I stole them.

Now in truth most stores have a policy that once its out the door

M: Ok do you have anyone who can come get your niece and son?

DD:Why it's only like $100 worth of stuff

M: I'm sure you have

DD: FOR WHAT?

M: Child Endangerment.

DD: Bullshit.

M: STOP SWEARING IN FRONT OF YOUR NIECE AND SON!

DD: [Glares at me]

M: Listen I'm not trying be an ass here. You're not just gonna walk away.  You used two children to steal.  That's Child Endangerment.  That's a felony.  Someone is gonna have to come get these kids.  

DD: Nah you're lying. I'll be fine

M: I'm not lying. Listen I know you've been a pain in the ass and we've been harsh back but we are tryna help you here.  Would you rather someone grab them here or at the police station while you're locked up?

DD: Stop playing.  I'll be fine.

Eventually me and Stacy gave up tryna convince her and we sat in silence until the cops arrived. They did what they needed to do

DD: Why?

Cop: To come get the kids?

DD: What? Why?

M: I already tried to explain.

DD: Explain what?

Cop: Well someone needs to come get the kids.

DD: WHY?

Cop: Because you're going to jail for the weekend?

DD: WHAT? WHY?

Cop: Seriously?

The cop explained the child endangerment charges and how it was Saturday so she'd have to wait till Monday to be arraigned. DD was not happy about it. She was also shocked that I

DD: They don't have anyone else. I'm the only one.

Cop: Well then how come the Little Girl has a different address then you.

DD:  Tax Reasons.  [WELP NOW FUCK THE BACK HOE! CAN WE GET THAT GIANT DRILL MACHINE THEY HAD IN ARMAGEDDON?  MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE]

Cop: Tax Reasons?

DD: Yea it helps with Taxes. But she doesn't live there.

Cop: So you're telling me you're also committing tax fraud?


DD: Ummm.....No.  She lives with her mom.

Eventually the Little Girl told us her moms name and number, then promptly had an ""allergic reaction"" the second she bit into her meal. You know, the one she chose. The officer on duty decided an ambulance wouldn't get there in time so took out an epipen and told her to hold still so he could stab it into her heart to save her.  She promptly announced that she was fine, and it was ""just gas"".

I work as a kitchen grunt at a fast food place. My favorite station is drive-thru because we are a bit of an upper-class place and our menu items border on ridiculously complicated

Late one night, as though he's being forced to order food against his will. He orders about seventy dollars worth of food, and says that he wants his food in ""separate bags,"" which is fine. We get that a lot. So I listen as he lists what goes in the first bag, then the second bag. Then he makes some modifications to the first bag. Then he asks to change something in the second bag. Then he asks to remove some items from the first bag and put them in the second bag. This starts to get on my nerves, but I seem to be following along just fine, and I go with it. Finally, he says ""So what's the total on the first order?""

Oh *snap*. It dawns on me that he wanted separate *orders*, because our point-of-sale software is very badly designed and it's a nightmare to split arbitrary items onto a separate check. So I tell him to pull around to the window (there were no other cars in the lane at the time) and I'd tell him his total there. 

When he gets to the window, ""I'm sorry, sir, but I didn't quite catch that you wanted your check split into different orders, I thought you just wanted separate bags. So I'm going to go through everything one more time just to make sure I have them on the correct checks.""

And I do. I meticulously list every single item he ordered, no joke. But I walk him through each check, and I give him his total for a check and swipe his card before moving onto the next. This is my typical problem resolution strategy when I'm not entirely sure what the customer ordered.

But to my horror, and he gives me an odd look. I ask, ""Is something the matter?"" and he says ""Wait, this is all wrong. These are all on the wrong checks.""

For example

I have two tables of my own to take care of, which came in after my table, was ahead of mine in waiting for a chef. No big deal, right? It wasn't my fault. The people at my table were genuinely sad because they thought they dropped the ball. Nope. After I go back to enter in some drinks in the POS, my manager comes in and starts chewing me out for purposefully holding the order so I could score the better chef. This goes on for awhile, but I'm speechless and just leave my station flabbergasted. 

During the rush, and busses it. After I finally get a break to rest, she chews me and the other waiter out for being so slow and irresponsible. ""I like the other waiter better! He actually cleans his tables! Now, you guys owe me money. Pay me for cleaning your tables, because it's not my job to do it!""  

Fast forward to 9PM, sad that she wasn't going to be sat with anyone else. I tell her that I and another waiter will gladly sit with her if it helps her feel comfortable. She agrees, and sits down. In run the manager, the boss' wife and the dining room server. The boss' wife guides who through the menu, while, at the same time, the server shows her all the drinks in drink menu

I walk over, I take her order as she's ready to eat. My manager yells from the station that it's (The boss' wife) Ashley's table. I shrug it off and continue. I run into the back to give the chef the ticket. As soon as I do that, out comes my manager. ""Amildpikachu! That's not your table! It's Ashley's! You, go clock out!""

So

Two Seasons ago, and toy's occasional quantum status as people. You might say that we were them, even. However, despite the fearsome reputation the company has as a place to work for, I was quite enjoying it. My boss didn't mind if I fucked around in a Spider-man mask on occasion, and the HR guy let me do toy demos once a month. Any job where I get paid to play with remote controlled helicopters for four hours is a fantastic job in my book.

Also I was back-of-house now and didn't have to come within a mile of customer service

On this particular December morn, as the least experienced member of our illustrious minimum-wage association, I was booted out to suffer on the sales floor. Given that Yule loomed over the end of the week like Santa over a plate of confectioneries, we were packed. 

A fair matron rushed up to me, ""I absolutely need a Crayola Crayon Maker or my daughter's Christmas will be ruined.""

Now as an aside, and whenever people make me out to be their kid's last hope to receive the  one gift that would make-up for being mentally traumatized by their parents I remember my mother taking out two jobs when I was a brat so my sister and I could have half the stuff we wanted. I don't want to feel responsible for people's holiday not playing out like a Disney movie. God dammit, don't put that on me. I think I'll give Mom a hug when I get home tonight.

So, and the fact that I was getting paid to do this sort of thing, I told her that I would quest into the fabled ""Back"" for her. 

I immediately rushed to the greatest of Sages, and I was bathed in the illuminating electric glow. We had exactly two in the store, and both were on the sales floor. Flying fucking shit dammit. 

But how could I call myself a knight if I surrendered at the first sign of resistance? My noble ancestors would be ashamed of me! After freaking out about how they were alive in a world that they didn't understand

(Though worst come to worst I could probably distract them with indoor plumbing for a good month.)

I asked the font of knowledge where my prizes were last stored. I received a few bays, and the makes thereof. 

I returned to the matron with a heavy heart, I would search until I found them. If they were still in the store, they would be mine. This I swore on my honor. Then I remembered how I stole my sister's dessert the night before and swore on the holiday season itself. Mentally of course, since I don't actually talk like that out loud.

Surprise of all surprises, the customer departs in a huff. But she remained, determined to wait out my efforts, and my previous coldness regarding her cause melted away. I resolved to do my absolute best to find a Crayola Crayon Maker for her.

I journeyed to the faraway hills of the re-shop carts. My prize dwelt not among the people there. I climbed the fabled cliffs of overstock bays

It was then that I knew where I must go. The mountains of shit that got unloaded from the truck last night. While technically in the back

But no! I did not come this far to be defeated by a tower of cardboard boxes! (Seriously

Reaching the loading dock, lay a box of Crayola Crayon Makers, sweeter than any gem ever unearthed by mortal men. It had to be. It *had* to be!

I spent twenty minutes crawling around and on top of the pile. It was nowhere in sight. I excavated several tunnels into the depths

Suddenly, a box with the ""Crayola"" brand emblazoned upon it peeked out of the gloom. I strained to see if it was followed the the word ""crayon"", which would hopefully bring the word ""maker"" along with it, but I could not make anything else out.

Hope was kindled. 

I carefully crafted a tunnel through the heart of the mountain, and strained, and managed to get half of my palm on the box. This gave me enough leverage to pull it towards me.

I felt like the event should have been accompanied by sunbursts and the choir invisible. As it was I read the words ""Crayola Crayon Maker"" celebrated only by a cloud of dust and spider poop. Still, a tribute to my conquest, and raised my fist in victory.

As I did so I accidentally punched the roof of my tunnel and collapsed it onto myself. I was trapped. Entombed

Fortunately my compatriots had heard my yodel of triumph and came to investigate. A few minutes later I was free of my premature grave

When I need to put down her bags on a bench for a moment to regrip because of wet hands, she bitches at me.

She practically has tears in her eyes looking at the bankruptcy signs.  I go over and say hello, she actually gives me a hug (never happened before) and tells me how sorry she is and asks if I have a new job yet, actually concerned for me as a person.  We chat for a minute, then I tell her I have to do other things, and I knew she'd be taken care of).  Then I go back to disassembling empty fixtures.  That's when I see Gerty Goodlife is in the store

After half an hour, and grab Nanny's bags.  I put them in her car and she hands me a fifty!  I tell her it's too much (usually it's two or five).  She laughs at me and tells me ""I just bought two thousand dollars worth of crap I don't really need so I can certainly give a nice boy like you $50"" (Nice boy, btw, I'm mid-late 40's) I smile, hug her again and go back to the store.

There's Gerty at the door with six bags looking pissy and tells me ""You need to carry these to my car.""  The biggest shit eating grin spreads across my face:

""I'm sorry

""I just saw you do a carry out!"" she screeches.

""Actually, go talk to the Chief Liquidator, he's right there."" I say pointing.  Then I go back to work disassembling fixtures, listening to the screeching coming from the front of the store for the next half hour as the chief liquidator tells her to drive her car close to the front doors and load her own damn car.

A little back story: My coworker tells me how the girl and her sister had tried to get her fired once for something completely unrelated to work. Other than somebody brought up where my coworker works in a Facebook argument


So, I am wiping down a table that is one table away from theirs. They proceed to have a conversation rather loudly that goes a little something like this...

Boy one: *Man I'm glad I don't have to work here.*

Boy two: *Me too

Boy one:  * *looks over* * *Oh my God you're right.*

Girl: * *laughs* * *Guys that's not nice.* [sarcastically


Are you fucking kidding me? Why on earth would you say that to somebody? They weren't prizes either... For clarification


So I walk away to go get a broom to just sweep, when I had to sweep the area where they are sitting, they make sure to have another loud conversation about me.


Boy one: *Oh

Boy two: *Just watch her bend over

Girl: *I'm glad I don't have that muffin top. That's just ridiculous. Obviously she needs clothes that fit.*

Boy two: *I'm glad you're not fat.* **[This is to his ridiculously thin girlfriend.]**


So I promptly left to just clean the other side of the lobby, my boyfriend (we work together) asks me what's wrong. I shrugged it off, told him it was nothing and finished that part of the lobby as soon as possible. 


I empty the mop bucket and come back to the front line to take my position back over, were thrown out of our establishment. He proceeded to tell them that when they (the group of teenagers) initially ordered their food nobody said anything to them besides the obvious questions for their order. And that when his employee (me) went to clean the lobby, she didn't say a word to them. He had been in the office at that time counting the safe down, and could see me on the camera system. One mom left it at that, however the other mother didn't. She tried to question his authority, and he eventually just told her that it wasn't his job to parent her children. That they should have more respect for his employees, because every time they come into our establishment, and he always gets a call from her. He said he would be glad to sit down with the owner

Me: Of course

Customer: Let's just ring it all up and see how much it is first...

Me: Okayyyy..... (Insert beeps) your total is about $115.00.

Customer: I knew I couldn't get it all...

Me: What do you want me to take off?

Customer: All of it. I still have to go to Aldi and get stuff.

So I called a manager
Just as I'm asking her if she would like us to take care of her cart

Me: Do you want to go ahead and get these?

Customer: I don't know... Lets see how much it is.

This time it was about $30.00.

Once again she says its too much and asks to cancel it. Different manager aborts.

We repeat this process about five times. When we finally get back to the original manager

Customer: But I'm poor! Can't we just do this one more time? I need this stuff!

Manager: Yes

So on this particular Sunday the phone goes in the pharmacy five minutes after we've opened. The Pharmacist answers and its a customer asking where her medication is. For older customers we offer a delivery service whereby their medication is delivered to their house each month so they don't have to come into town to pick it up. This particular customer had not received her medication and we were scouring the pharmacy and the computer system to find out why.

As she continued with her abuse we eventually found our delivery list and realised that we had attempted to deliver her medication the day before but she wasn't in when the driver took it to her door. So turns out it was actually really her fault anyway.

She still needed her medication (and was apparently unable to wait for it to be redelivered the next day) so we had to call a taxi and asked the driver to deliver the prescription to her house. The driver was not comfortable carrying a prescription without a member of staff so we ended up sending one of the pharmacy team in the taxi with him and we delivered it to her door. Of course, she wasn't even appreciative when we finally got the medicine to her.

first post

This story takes place roughly 10 years ago when I was in university and worked part-time for a fast food chain. While it wasn't uncommoon for customers to be rude, this whole ""get me you manager"" attitude isn't really common there either. You deal with me and me alone, and I'll throw you out if you don't behave. Managers have better things to do with their time.

It was a Friday evening shift in town, handing me whatever our customers ordered. In came those two Turkish guys, talking in Turkish about what they'd done this evening. I greeted them politely and took their orders, they wanted to eat in store. That's when one of them started telling the other one in Turkish how that blonde girl behind the till would certainly be a good f*ck, how he knew for sure I would be easy to pick up since slutty till girls like me should be grateful for his attention etc. etc. Little did Mr. Dumbass know that the one they were mocking could understand every single word they said. I turned around, looked at my manager - who was aware I knew Turkish - grinned, and whispered ""Watch this"". I put their order on a tray, looked at the one who'd unsulted me, will be happy about the way you just insulted his wife."" 

Mr. Douche got white as a sheet and started stammering. It was awesome. He and his friend basically grabbed their food and ran out of the store

However, I hang up, thinking I have helped her make a final decision.  She calls back 4 more times, each time with ""another quick question.""  In total, I spend 2 hours on the phone with her.

The next day, she's nowhere to be seen, so I go on helping other people.  About an hour later, my coworker comes off the floor to get a manager.  As he passes me, he says ""This lady's killing me!""  She's been talking to him for an hour about iPads.  It turns out he basically had to repeat everything I had told her on the phone.  She also talks to our manager for another hour, again being told the exact same information.

At this point, and are about to swipe her card when she decides that she doesn't want it because it doesn't have 3G on it.  Someone tells her she could get a mobile hotspot from her cellular carrier if that was important for her.  So she stands at the desk for an hour as she calls verizon to ask them every question ever conceived in relation to 3G mobile hotspot.  

Eventually she decides to go through with the order.  We all think she's left.  However, as I'm in the middle of processing a huge iPad mini order, and demands to know why anyone would make a laptop with one USB port.  After lots of ridiculousness with this, she buys a USB hub, and leaves.  About 45 minutes later, we get a phone call from her.

She had read all of the fine print on the back of her receipt after she got home, she had purchased applecare coverage after getting a lengthy explanation of what that entailed).  She seems satisfied and hangs up.  At the end of my shift, I bet my coworker that she'll either show up in the store first thing the next morning, or call us as soon as we open.  He laughs and says no way.

We opened at 8 this morning.  At 8:01, it is her.  She has called to complain about the fact that Windows 7 is not the operating system on AN APPLE COMPUTER.  We tell her about parallels (Windows for Mac) and hang up.  She shall surely return.  And we will be ready.

1359344641.0,17ephp,"""I can't feed forty kids with these two crappy pizzas!""",WinnifredBurkle,677,126,105,"So I spent some time working for a children's play place and pizza restaurant chain when I was in high school and college. I dealt with lots of crazy stuff (see previous post and comments)

I live in a moderately sized southern town with some overly entitled southern housewives. They were the worst. Not like Pinterest moms now

One particular mom stands out more than others, and some tokens. The main difference between the two was how many kids were included, how many tokens you got, and wether or not a party hostess helped with your party. 

Before I became shift manager (and sometimes after) I was a party hostess. For the most part I loved it. It was fun to do my little skit with the mascot and cut the cake and I got sweet tips for it

This mom had purchased the most expensive package. It came with admission for 8 kids with admission discounted for any extras
free tokens, give her her 8 wristbands for the guests (she assures me that no more than that will be coming) and start to get things together in the party area. 

I find out from my coworker up front that more and more kids come in for this party. At first she tries to sneak them in

It takes a while, and the kitchen finally assures me that the two discounted pizzas we talked about at check in were all she ordered. I assume that the other parents were going to order food for themselves and their children, as unfair as that would be, and call them back. 

So the forty kids come back, and these kids are *starving*. The fatass birthday kid grabs three pieces for himself, because its his birthday and he can do that, which leaves 11 pieces of pizza for 38 kids and all their parents. 

The party mom storms over and asks where her other pizzas are. I tell her that we made all the pizzas she'd ordered. No

""Do you think I'm *stupid?* Why would I have forty kids and only two pizzas? You should have know and made them anyway

""Ma'am, but it'll be a while before they're ready and your allotted time in the party area will be over. I'm terribly sorry, what would you like me to do?""

She blows up. ""Well I would have really liked it to not have an idiot take care f my son's party! I can't feed forty kids with these two crappy pizzas!"" 

It was a ridiculously busy day and I had at least two more parties to do after hers, who explained he was sorry about the pizzas but we had no way of knowing that she wanted more. (I guess now we could have asked her, but how is that our responsibility? And what if a kid had had an allergy or something and that's why she didn't order more? I mean, who knows.) He offered her hot dogs as an easy way of feeding every guest quickly, but she got even more pissed when she found out she'd have to pay for them, even at a discount. 

I didn't go back to that party until they had all left, and flipped her shit when she got the final bill. 

I don't think she realized that my boss included a tip for me (for having to put up with her and her forty guests) in the bill. She probably would have come back and burned the place down.

Yeah? How about mocha, maybe?"" Like she's 5 and stupid. My barista says ""oh that was supposed to be a mint mocha? I'm so sorry, hold on one second.""

We whip one up for her and I head to the window with it. ""I'm really sorry for the mix up! Here's a brand new mint--"" She interrupts

She keeps screaming at me for several minutes, I want a refund, this isn't a mint mocha..."") as I'm trying to gather the pertinent information to get her refund for her. If she had listened to me for one second, she would have also received the mint mocha, for free. I can't get her to slow down or listen to me for one second so I can't even find her order to give her the refund (I kind of need more information than ""I wanted a mint mocha but didn't get it"" - what did she pay with? what time of day did she come?). Plus there's a line of customers building up behind her.

So I asked her, ""I'M NOT YELLING!"" before yelling at me that she paid with a Discover card an hour ago.

(Bonus: This information lets me know that this woman in fact ordered a plain latte

I thank her for the information, and yelling to see the manager. ""Oh, I'm the manager. Don't worry, it will just be a minute, I'm really sorry about all this.""

""YOU?? YOU'RE the manager?"" ... She pauses. ""We'll see about that.""

Literally just a few seconds later I get the order voided and run the receipt out to her while my baristas take care of the line behind her. She is on the phone. She sees me there but pointedly turns to face the other direction. I'm left standing there for almost 5 minutes before she rolls down her window and looks at me. ""Here's your void receipt

I get back into the shop only to be informed that while I was outside waiting for her to roll her window down, too.

Maybe that was my mistake, actually - being too nice when I should have been all, ""LISTEN HERE - show me some R-E-S-P-E-C-T, lady!!""

Also because I'm not some big burly man that people are afraid of pissing off. -sigh-

I'm running around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to find the schedule to do a break/lunch check so we don't fall behind on breaks.

1374443455.0,1irt5f,It was either laugh or cry.,I_try_hardish,639,98,91,"I told this story to my buddy yesterday and he said it belonged here...

So I'm a 24 year old white female working at a gas station which is pretty rare around here so I pretty much hear lewd and suggestive comments every day

I work morning shifts alone on the weekends. I'm the assistant manager so during the week I either have one or two people with me so it would figure that this would happen on a Saturday. It was sometime in the afternoon between 12 and 3 when a male and a female walk into my store. It's in the middle of Satan's butthole hot July right now so the first thing I notice when the guy walks in is his long coat. Not a trench coat

So this guy is shuffling around picking up random shit to look at while his counter-part walks to the bathroom in the back. A woman and her son walk in to pay for some gas really quickly so I handle that while still pretty much not paying attention to the guy even though something looked kind of off about him. I check out the mother and she and her kid exits the store, and the girl who must obviously be having some issues because she still hasn't come back out of the bathroom.

I finally shift my attention to coat man and ask him if he needs help or is looking for something specific. He mumbles something I can't hear so I lean forward and ask him to kindly speak up. He says ""yeah...I need some fresh air."" Then he kind of awkward jump/hops to directly in front of me and flings his jacket wide open. This is when I realize what looked so weird about him. He was wearing a long coat but I could still see his bare legs. It just looked awkward.

So there he stands in front of me in his birthday suit with his little noodle still flopping around in a semi circle from his little hop. So I stand there and stare in shock for a solid three seconds and take in this dudes small frame with tiny little milk dud looking nipples and teeny little tootsie roll tinkie-winkie. Then with a force that was physically painful

Now when I say burst, laugh diarrhea that was so forceful that spittle flew out of my mouth. To make it worse for him, I covered my mouth and pointed at him. It was laughter so hard that noise stopped coming out of me and Niagara Falls started streaming from my eyeballs. A look of hurt-shock flashes across his face and a dark crimson color starts setting in. By this time it was too late for me, I couldn't stop myself. Finally the noise caught up with my laughter and I just threw my head back and hee-hawed until I was pretty sure I was going to be sick. 

Hearing all of the commotion, and then takes up my laughter with me. By this time the guy is clutching his coat around his body like a nervous first time lover. Through a wave of tears, I see the other passengers outside laughing and bouncing around so much while pointing at us that the whole car is rocking back and forth.

The dude spins around to make a quick get-away and runs face first into the glass door. The girl comes to his rescue and helps his out of the store in a half jog to their car. On the way there he stumbles over the curb. He catches his balance but the back of his jacket flew up exposing his bare white ass. I lost it.

At this point I'm pretty sure my laugh sounds diseased because my vocals were so scratchy and I couldn't catch my breath. I'm pretty sure the guy was crying as I caught one last glimpse of his face during their hurried retreat. It took me a long time to regain my composure. It didn't help that everyone that came in for the next hour asked me if I was ok since my face was all puffed up and my eyes were completely bloodshot. I would tell them what happened and we would have a good laugh together. In pretty sure I lost 5 pounds by the end of the day.

On this particular night, just the cash register, for people who only needed milk or chips orwhatever. We only had two registers anyway, but there was no one else helping me out today and my manager was in the back working on something. It was a slow night, so I didn't mind, until in walked the largest man I've ever seen in my life.

He was probably five hundred pounds

He came through the doors, and walked right over to me. 

""Hi

I pointed to the sign over my head,' and said, ""Yes, we have a pharmacy; it's in the back."" Our store wasn't very big; I could see the pharmacy from the front counter, about a hundred feet away, tops. If he had just turned around, he would have seen it. He didn't even look up at the sign

He said, do tests on pills or something? To see what kind of pill it is?""

That's a question I hadn't yet come across. It was my first night alone, I could *do* this. I am a *retail employee.*

I said: ""I don't believe that's something we do here. We do have a pharmacist in the back who can definitely talk to you about that

He said: ""OK because, but I'm afraid to take one because what if it's not Viagra, you know? So what do you think I should do?""

I stammered something like: ""Well, um, see if things... well...""

He didn't even seem to be listening to my response, without breathing, ""OK I have another question my friend told me about I read online I heard something about... Vibrating condoms. Do those exist? Where can I get one?""

Trying to keep a neutral face, but condoms that come with a vibrating ring. They're on the condom rack, back by the pharmacy."" Again, I pointed to the sign above my head.

""So how are those?"" he asked.

""Sorry?""

""How are those? Do the ladies like them? You seem like quite the stud

Now, so asking me about ""the ladies"" would not really get you a good answer even now.

I said something like

He waddled down the center of the store toward the pharmacy, looked back at me, and shrugged comically. I tried to motion that they were on the bottom of the rack, but he just shrugged again, and then waved me to come back.

Like I said, what the hell, locked my register, and walked back to him.

I bent down and picked up the two boxed varieties we had and handed him one of each. 

He asked: ""What's the difference?""

I said: ""One is Durex

He said: ""OK

Painfully virginal, naive. But at this point, I realized that he wasn't actually just shopping for vibrating condoms, he was ""enjoying"" having me help him pick them out.

I read off the basic description on the front of the box

""Which one should I get?"" he asked. ""I'll trust you.""

I handed him the more expensive box.

""Excellent

I quickly rang the box up and told him his total

""So

""Um,"" I answered.

""OK

I picked up the box to read the instructions on the back,"" which I definintely was not interested in saying.

So that's when I said, and, slightly chagrined, he paid me.

As he was leaving

I told him I was actually leaving for the day immediately (even though I still had hours upon hours left)

The second the door whooshed shut behind him

""Sure, which is about $70, Barbie dollhouse for $100..."" She wants to know what they look like and what they all include, and I describe them to her.

1370371677.0,1fo28a,The mute leading the blind.,Vamprimosa,643,107,33,"Preface: This story happened a little over a year ago. I work for a small convenience/drug store. Our store is located near the local school for the blind so we regularly have visually impaired customers in our store that we assist.

It was the middle of allergy season and I was working the front register. I have terrible allergies and I get unreasonably sick at least twice a year from them. My throat was sore and my voice raspy at the beginning of my shift, to non-existent. It was extremely difficult for me to even make the most basic of sounds. Not wanting to lose any of my hours for the week, I pushed through and made a sign that I taped to the counter saying something along the lines of, ""I have lost my voice, I will communicate as best I can. Sorry for the inconvenience."" This was working pretty well for most of the customers, most apologizing and telling me they hoped that I get better soon. Everything was running smoothly with no real problems until one of our blind customers comes in.

He was a semi-regular customer who also has Aspergers. It was getting late in the evening and business had died down

He notices something is off about our interaction seeing as the blind the customer is still standing there screaming ""HELLO! I NEED SOMEONE TO HELP ME!"". So I motion to the customer behind him in line to read the sign taped to my counter. He reads the sign, he can't read the responses or feel the buttons. The customer behind him (who was very patient) had to help me guide him through the payment options. He left shortly after still apologizing profusely. My manager came to the front at the tail end of this transaction. He sent me home shortly after.

Definitely my most sitcom worthy story.

However  makes you cherish the truly humble and amazing people that exist in this rotten society. 

I had a guy roll up to my register in a wheel chair at the candy store. We have higher shelves for more expensive candy so kids can't stick their hands in it. He tells me he is making little gift jars for some of his coworkers. He bought a few jars from a dollar store and wanted to fill one with gummy pigs and jelly beans to call it ""pork and beans"" which I found this to be hilarious. He shamefully said he might need help as he had a recent stroke and sometimes his hands don't function and he didn't want to spill anything.  I instantly told him anything he needed help with I would be more than glad to. As I was filling his jars he started talking about anything and everything. He told me of bars I should visit, then he went into a bit of detail on why he was missing a leg.  He said he stepped on a nail while helpping someone carry something in his store but was not on the clock. He then contracted a flesh eating bacteria that would eventually take his left leg,  right foot,  and his right eye.  (he said the doctor did a great job with his eye and that's no lie.  I couldn't tell the difference) he said he hated life at that point and had attempted suicide a few times but one day he decided ""why the fuck am I so angry about?  I'm still alive so who cares about that other stuff""  I thought wow this guy has absolutely nothing going for him yet he is still such a positive person.  I finally finished filling his jars and when I rang it up I knocked off like $5 cause I enjoyed his company. It cost him a little over $20 and he paid with $25 and told me to keep the change. I humbly declined and he said it's not up to you.  Cause if you try to hand me that money it's gonna look like you are taking money from a handicapped dude. ""it will barely get you a gallon of gas,  heck if i was you I'd check the ground for some change and go get that $5 deal for Arby's,  damn roast beef is so good"",  I laughed for like 5 min on that comment.

My job is sort of an operations supervisor.  I supervise the booth attendants who are on the front line selling the parking tickets to customers as they enter the ramps

Tonight there was an event that brought in 15, the night went relatively smoothly until the end.  Most people were orderly and not causing massive traffic backups, there were only minor issues with the machinery, and even the least competent of my employees were keeping their heads together and doing their jobs well.

Then the big event let out.  15, and it can take a long time for people to get out.  In this case it was about an hour, which is actually pretty extraordinary for an event of this type.  To put that in perspective, there was an event about half the size last night and it took over two hours for everyone to get out of the ramps.

Security and booth attendants are stationed at all of the ramps to help customers exit.  It may seem like exiting a parking ramp should not be a complicated thing

Most people are very excited about the event they just attended and they are happy and joyful and funny (and quite drunk).  Some people are very

Even from my spot 20 yards away I can see how worked up he is.  He stops his car, and begins screaming in his face.  He is losing his mind so thoroughly that spit is flying from his mouth as he yells.  I see my security officer about to lose his patience with the guy, so I rushed up to try and diffuse the situation.

When I get to them I ask what the problem is.  The guy yells, really hurts.

I fell to the ground, all while calling for other security to back us up and for a dispatcher to call the police.  The rest of it is rather fuzzy for me as I'm sort of small, and not exactly used to being punched in the face, but the two of them scuffle for a while until the cops show up.  They arrested the guy, and I went off to the hospital.  Nothing in my face is broken, just good and bruised up.  I am also on some pretty fun painkillers.

I have worked at 3 different retail companies, one was a popular electronic retail chain, and the other (where I currently work) is a cell phone store. This event happened a few months ago.

So I'm working in the cell phone store one day (let's call it a Saturday) and it's just me and the new guy. The New Guy knows what he has to do, but with me there in case it gets busy before closing, or the new guy needs help with something. So I bought my ticket for The Evil Dead for an hour after I got off (time to get to the theater, concessions, etc).

Mid-day, I mean she has a driver/nurse/care giver walking with her (this woman was in her 80s, the nurse looked to be 40s-50s). She has a flip phone, and tells me she wants a smart phone in case she ever gets lost for GPS reasons. The nurse/caregiver/whatever only spoke...well I'm not sure what it was but neither me nor the new guy spoke it. The old woman was Asian, so perhaps it was an Asian language, all I know is that it wasn't English or Spanish.

Anyways, she asks to hold it, then asks me to do something on the phone (whether it's to check email, GPS, weather, etc). It would go something like this:

Old Crabby: Can you show me how to launch the weather?

Me: Ok (pushes the weather app icon for her)

Old Crabby smacks my hand

Old Crabby: Let me do it!!!

Yes. She told me to do it for her, so whatever as long as I get a sale. This went on for about an hour, trying out every single phone in the store. Eventually, she settled on the Galaxy Note because of it's big screen and her vision issues. Then I see her go through her paperwork, and bring out dozens of flyers. As I look, I see that even though there are dozens of flyers, there are multiples. There were only two kinds of flyers in there:

1. The flyer for the competitor
2. A flyer for out store

She then demands that I give her the sale price of the other store. Now I notice this flyer is for the company I worked for before where I work now (I really don't want to say names, and only have 4 units or so per store. So I mention this to her, she accuses me of being a liar, then demands I call their stores and ask for their inventory information. I'm a little ticked off at this point, mostly as she wasted my hour (she knew what phone she wanted) and I just wanted to say ""Well go to their store and leave me alone"". However, I'm management, so I decided to be polite, and take it like a weak new guy in a prison shower. 

I call up every store they have in a 50 mile radius of our store AND this woman's apartment

It takes half an hour to run her credit as she didn't trust me with her social security number, I had her call customer service to setup her account over the store phone (because apparently saying it all out loud with me next to her was safer). She gets approved, I go to setup her phone, and at this point she's been in the store a good two hours. 

Old Crabby: You should give me the competitor sale price

Me: I'm sorry miss

Old Crabby: But you've kept me here for two hours already! What about customer satisfaction (yes

Me: I'm sorry miss. But if you want this phone today

Old Crabby: Oh fine.

So I setup her phone

Old Crabby: I need you to show me how to use this phone!

So remember earlier she would hold up the display and make me explain every feature while hitting me? Yeah

By the time I was done explaining the phone, and no it hadn't even been 5 hours) and demanded to file a complaint with my manager. That's when I pulled off my name badge, and handed it to her so she could look closely and see the ""Manager"" title.

She said she had to use the bathroom, who watched the whole thing in stunned silence, looked at me and said ""You know we closed thirty minutes ago, right?""

Yup. Not only was I stuck at work a good 90 minutes past when I should've, then leads while cursing me. We closed as quickly as we could, and I ended up locking up the store right around the time the movie ended. Luckily AMC agreed to exchange my ticket for a later showing so I could still see my movie.

A few days later, didn't setup her phone, etc. The new employee backed up my store exactly, and my boss, (yes, I am a store manager, this guy runs all the stores in the area), this is a nice guy. He doesn't curse, how did you resist hitting this bitch?""

It on this mind boggling hot day that was I, and only stop when an object is placed in the way of this laser at the front. Cleared up? On with the tale.

A woman in her middle fifties walks up, and her objects quickly pile up - that's okay, that's why the conveyor belt is so long. I've done all the cold food, now it's onto the cans and boxes. She's put everything on haphazardly, and me being a good little retail slave is properly sorting out groceries as I go.

&gt;Her: Well... I might have opened it... earlier... to see if it was the right one... maybe the lid... wasn't on... properly.

It was at this point I did the retailer's biggest no-no. 

&gt;Me: You think?

In my defense, I would be the one cleaning this. Who even opens goddamn maple syrup? To smell it? It's pure sugar, there's not going to be much wrong with it.

Customer lady gets huffy and tells me I should have been more careful with her groceries and then it wouldn't have fallen over. I point out that a) I am yet to even find the maple syrup amongst her ~~shit stacking~~ unique way of item placing and the b) It wouldn't have spilt if she hadn't opened it.

She asks me what she's suppose to do with the groceries '**you have ruined**!!'. I have no idea. I call the supervisor. She calls the manager.

He explains to her that while technically, but [store] would not make her pay for the items already damaged.

She hit the roof.

As the incompetent cashier had ruined her groceries, alert the media about [store]'s scandalous policies, have store credit, get all her non-damaged items for free.

She is politely but firmly asked to leave. 

She refuses to, or he will be forced to post a banning notice. She storms out, having not paid for anything, screaming that she will contact *everyone* she knows to boycott [store]. Manager smiles.  

Meanwhile the culprit of this debacles, sticky, and sweet smelling. The rest of the stock had to be thrown out, as literally *everything* had been covered in maple syrup. Worst ever.

As I was doing so, I noticed a woman ""trying"" the grapes. Now, this isn't *usually* a problem but I sorta frown upon it. I mean, cherries

**Me:** Cool. In future

**GL:** I'm just trying them!!!!

**Me:** I understand. Normally we wouldn't say anything if you were just trying one

**GL:** Oh well fine then!!

*drops the remaining grapes into my tomato crate on my flat deck*

*walks off*

I think she was a little embarrassed she was 'caught' and didn't like the idea I challenged her. Like I said

So I continue with my flat deck and finish up with it. I wheel it back into the back of the department and inform the others I'm going to take my break. It was lunch time so I went to the front of the store (checkouts) to grab a sandwich and a drink. It was rather busy so there were a lot of people around. As I was walking to the sandwich stand who should I see standing in line but Grape Lady.

**Me:** Oh. Well

**GL:** Pfft. So what was the point of that then. You could have just let me have them and they wouldn't be wasted!

**Me:** Well like I said ma'am

**GL:** Why not?! If you're just going to waste them what's even the point?

**Me:** Because it's theft! That's why! One grape is theft but it's just one grape so we let it slide. A handful of grapes is a different matter. Please

*Grape Lady proceeds to place her basket of items on the ground and walk out of the store in utter disgust*

I watch as she walks away and heads for the exit. I then start to find myself a checkout so I can purchase my lunch. As I spot a small line in front of the VERY busy express lanes

**GL:** I'M GOING TO LAY AN OFFICIAL COMPLAINT ABOUT YOU!!! YOU DO **NOT** TALK TO CUSTOMERS LIKE THAT!!! HOW DARE YOU!!!

Right then, the MANAGER (who was at checkouts helping with the rush at the time)... everyone! I knew if I walked away from this, every single person that heard her say that to me would instantly assume I was the rudest jerk in the store (good ol' public opinion, aye?). I don't know what came over me but I spoke up and came out with this;

**Me:** Really... and what are you gonna say? ""Oh, isn't it. In fact, the manager is standing RIGHT THERE (pointing to him). Why don't you tell him?!

You could hear a pin drop. Everyone then looked at her. Her jaw dropped

I heard one lady in line say to me ""Good on you."" and a group of students in the express lanes went ""awwwwkward...."" in her direction. It was awesome!

Once I purchased my lunch, ok... well, I can't really say anything other than don't talk to customers in front of everyone like that but I know how it would have looked on you if you didn't. So, well done.""

My heart was racing for a good 10min after that. I never saw her again.

*hmm

**tl;dr** Caught someone eating a large quantity of grapes. She didn't like me informing her that it's ok to try one but not a handful. She threatened to lay a complaint and I told her she was shoplifting. So go ahead!

A couple months ago, wished them a nice evening, and sent them on their way. The whole interaction took probably about 15 minutes.

Ten minutes later, ""Next time you do something like this,"" (pointing at the crab legs) ""you need to tell me first.""

I was actually speechless for a minute before I asked him

He tells me that the two guys had tried to walk out the door without paying for the crab legs (about $80) and when he confronted them they actually tried to fight him over it. 

At this point my face is bright red and I am being forced to ignore my customers to listen to this lecture. I apologize to my manager and tell him that I didn't realize they would try to walk out with it. Realize that the seafood counter is in the very back of the store

He tells me that next time

I was almost in tears at this point

There hasn't been an incident since, but I am still kind of in shock that I'm supposed to be profiling customers and informing a manager if someone that's ""too poor"" to buy seafood is trying to do so.

So to make it up to you for deleting that post

Anybody who is familiar with the place knows about exchanging tickets for prizes. You may also be aware of how most places have what's called a ticket bank, and ticket total in this filing cabinet. Nothing super fancy. 

So one day this mom comes in with a pretty small kid. He was about two or so and was mostly interested in playing in the kiddie area

Anyway, she doesn't trust that we didn't fix the machine to only count every second or third ticket. She wants me to count this huge pile of tickets by hand. I explain that that would probably result in more error as its really easy to lose your place, but she insists. I end up ripping all the tickets apart, so that its a huge pile of unattached tickets, and she has a total of around 500. 

Now, is a moderately sized stuffed version of our mascot. Those were around 1000, and this lady simply did not have enough. That didn't stop her from pointing at it and telling me that it was what she wanted. 

""I'm sorry ma'am

""No

""No ma'am

So we argue for a little while, but she doesn't decide on anything. At this point we're past our closing time, everyone else is doing what closing duties they can, and I'm stuck with this lady. 

Finally I say that I can put her tickets in a bank if she can't decide on a prize. She looks at me like I told her to shove her tickets up my ass for safekeeping. 

""Absolutely not! I don't trust you guys and those ticket banks! You probably steal from them!"" I give her a look

""NO. I want that stuffed animal. I'll just pay you the left over with cash.""

Now, and we didn't have a code or anything to put into the register to show that we sold a ticket item for cash. And besides, if that was allowed, we would run out of our bigger prizes really quickly, and have to spend more money to get more.  

""I'm sorry ma'am

Logic does not work on her. She goes on a tirade about how ""fucking stupid"" it is that she can't purchase an item with cash, with a finger up his nose for about twenty minutes. He didn't give a damn about the toy. 

Mom continued to argue

Finally, and I say ""Have a nice night!""

We split the tickets and ate a shit ton of candy. It was awesome. 

And there you go! Hope this makes up for deleting my other post-I'm sorry!! I'll keep posting about crazy ticket people and psycho party moms and crazy poop stories if you guys like. Just let me know!

He then tells me and the manager in English that he just wants a refill on his chili because it was not enough. We again explain that he has to purchase another one.

1358373774.0,16pkwo,Tales From a Former LP: Might Mouse Saves the Day.,Drunken_Black_Belt,643,127,79,"Hello all. I figure I'd share a story before heading away for a week or two.  I've told it on here before

**Mighty Mouse Saves the Day: Or Why I Quit Dudercrombie &amp; Bitch**

So obviously this was during my time with *Dudercrombie &amp; Bitch*.  I was already growing sick and tired with the company

Anyways, fun, and enjoyable to be around"".  But basically what they mean is young and extremely attractive.  And if you're a minority to boot? Fucking racial lottery jackpot as far as the company is concerned.  Here is a typical managers meeting summed up for any of their stores:

Manager 1: Guys we had to fire [insert names here] this week.  So this means we are low on African Americans.  

Manager 2: Me and Manager 3 went recruiting to [local event or popular hang out] and found X amount of candidates. 3 of them were African American and I got one Indian girl.

Manager 1: Great. Make sure you follow up with them so we can get them hired it'll look good with our numbers.

Now this may seem like an exaggeration but believe me its not.  It's bad enough to see people hired based off looks, the less attractive people were put into the back as ""Impact Team"". Basically stock.  Not that these people were usually ugly by any means. Just not ""Front Room Model material"".

Now I know some of you may be saying ""What does it matter? As long as they are hard workers?""  And you're right.  But a lot of times, and were great with customers. Others just wanted to get paid and do as little work as possible. You'll find that in any job, but its exacerbated when the little shits know they were hired because they are attractive. 

To make things worse

Anyways, and how they handled their shrink, but this is why I ended up leaving the company.

It was Saturday. Saturdays at this mall, and talking with other LP agents at other stores. It had been slow on the LP end. A sensor from a shirt found in the fitting room. A bracelet tag found stuffed into the pants of some jeans. Nothing huge. Nothing worth worrying about missing.  That's why I got the call from my *Follistar* store.  A manager there called and told me three hispanic guys had walked in, opened a bag, and swiped an entire table of colognes and bolted out. I told her to call the police and get the tape pulled, and to call two of the other stores. I was going to go to the *Dudercrombie and Bitch* main store and wait.  

 Luck was on my side when I walked in and saw the display in the front room was still up.  Directly to the right of the door was a table full of polos, two hispanic guys, matching the description my manager had given me, brushed passed me and walked over to the colognes.  So I stay at the table with the polos, and waved over the girl greeting in the front room. She was new, I hadn't met her before, but I figured she could follow simple instructions.  I made to act like I was asking her a question about the polo shirt I was holding, and go get the manager. Tell her to call the cops here now!""

The girl just stared at me like I had told her I do the Macarena with no pants on as a tribute to my fallen gang members.  I was trying to discreetly instruct her while watching these two asshats.  I told her again to go grab [Manager's name] and call the cops now. As I was talked to her, and swipes them in too.  Guy 1 then proceeds to walk toward the exit.

I hissed that the girl, I want the guy with the merchandise.  Guy 1 stops for a second, looks at me, then the bag in his hand.

Now when you make a LP stop

Me: Hi. My name is Drunken_Black_Belt.  I work for *B&amp;D* Loss Prevention and I'm going to need you to come with me.

What happened in this case was this:

Me: Hi

and then Guy 1 swung the entire bag at my face.

Nope. NOPE! FUCK THAT.  In the words of Ghandi "" IT'S GO TIME BITCH! DIPLOMACY OVER!""  

So guy swing bag at head and tries to run past me. I grab bag, and FINALLY runs off.  Good, she finally understands who I am.  Or so I thought.  I throw Guy to the ground.  I'm attempting to put him on his back, when some ass hat come running up and leading with his shoulder, drives right into me.  As he did so, he yells ""GET OFF HIM HE'S DOING HIS JOB"".  Thank god that Guy 1 is a fat out of shape fucker, cuz he's on the ground winded from our 20 second episode.  I throw the guy who just tackled me, and yell ""I'm the LP asshole.  I'm on my back at this point, Douchbag McShoulders over here is waving in my face to get my attention because he wants me to know that he's REALLY sorry and feels bad he didn't know I wasn't the thief.  Theres a huge crowd around us, and grabs his arms. I tell Shoulders to get the fuck away from me

Anyways, and we go back to the office.  They never got a call before. I walk in the back, and the girl I had been instructing is sitting with my manager. I ask what the hell they are doing. Manager says this girls trying to tell me something but that the girl doesn't speak english so manager doesn't know what.

Yup. Girl was hired, but maybe not in a job where you talk with customers, and stop shoplifters all day.   Processed Guy 1. Had just over $5500 worth of shit in the bag.  Got him for Assault, and Possession of a Shoplifting tool too. Had a talk with Manager and she  decided maybe this girl wasn't ready for the front room (good fucking call).  And the best part?  Mighty Mouse had been at the jewlery store next to B&amp;D buying an engagement ring. I went over to thank him, and the workers who knew me there (they allowed me watch my store from their store) gave him a 30% discount for helping out.

ZZ: No sorry this line is exclusively in silver

C: well why the hell do you even offer it then anyone who can't afford gold is not good enough to wear jewellery

C: anyways make me this bracelet in 24k white gold

ZZ: Umm I'm sorry miss but I can not 24k white gold does not exist it has to be alloyed and usually it's coated in rhodium.

C: what are you retarded? gold can be any color even green and black (this is true but once again it is alloyed and cannot be pure). Your obviously not good enough to know this. I want to speak to your manager your HEAD manager no middle managers.

Now here I'm kinda trying to not laugh

C: he does not know what he is talking about I want this bracelet in 24k white gold.

I pick up the phone again to speak with the lady.

I work at a college bookstore the first couple of weeks of each semester. It can get pretty brutal. I'm the only employee there who goes to a different college, which is a killer. Plus, hell hath no fury like a student who can't find a specific textbook. 

So it's the first day of school, called an idiot, and someone went so far as to tell me I'll ""Never set foot in a classroom here again."" I decided against telling them I don't even go here. 

I'm working the register mid-morning when a young man finally gets called up. His arms are full of art supplies and textbooks, we have to get a pre-order slip, go find the ISBN numbers of the required supplies, and fill out the pre-order form. 

As a cashier, and the line for the cash registers has died down a slight bit, so I agree to help him out. He has a long list of things he needs, so I spend the next twenty minutes running down paint samples and canvas and filling out pre-order forms. By the time I'm done, the line has stretched out again. He thanks me politely and says that he's going to get back in line, making a lighthearted comment about hoping the professor for his next class won't be angry with him for being late on the first day. Instead of making him wait another half hour in line, I take him back to my register and get his supplies pre-ordered. He thanks me again and leaves. 

Three hours later, and he realizes I'm off the clock. He apologizes and says he'll find someone else to help. I have to admit, when you come across a customer as nice as this one was, you tend to want to help them out. So, off the clock, I head back into the bookstore with him and help him gather the rest of his supplies. I tell him that since I'm clocked out, I won't be able to ring him up and that he'll have to wait in line. He understands

I walk with him to the end of the line on my way out the door. Before I can leave, telling her that I'm off the clock and unable to work a register. Her response? ""Then clock back in and check me out. It will only take a few minutes."" I explain to her that I won't be able to clock back in until one p.m., an hour after I clocked out. She immediately blows up on me, telling me that she watched me help the other customer find his things, and that I'm sexist. (I'm a girl.)

Another day, despite the events that I have told here, most of my days at the station were, in fact, rather dull.  Car comes in, say hi, take money, hand back receipt

It was also in a rather rich neighborhood.  Rare, Ferraris, Maseratis, Bentleys, Rolls Royces, Aston Martins, etc.  So when a very nice Porsche Carrera GT3 rolled into the station, as I always do, and lit up a cigarette (far enough away that I didn't have to yell at him).

It wasn't busy at that moment, a suit that I could tell was probably worth more than all my guitars put together.  Hair slicked back.  Shoes probably worth more than my shitty car.  And a crack pipe in his hand.

Double take.

Was I seeing that right?  I looked closer, a small glass pipe, with charring on one end and what looked like cotton in the other.  Huhn, never seen one of those outside of class.  I walked over to my assistant manager (who was part of the same criminal justice college classes I was) and surreptitiously told him about it.  He walked over, doing his best to look inconspicuous, and had a gander himself.  Yup, sure looks like a crack pipe.  Weird.

We had a quick debate as to whether we should call the police, he's not smoking it nor does he have any baggies of something yellowish and clumpy.  Probably should just let this one go.

But our minds got made up for us when a State Trooper pulls in.  Complete coincidence, do the greeting again.  ""By the way, sir, I'm not 100% certain of this, but it really looks like the guy over on pump 12 has a crack pipe in his hand.  Could you go take a look?""

It's a young cop.  Maybe 25.  And he gets that ""Oh ho, and steps out of his vehicle.  The driver of the Porsche has now walked back over to his car, as the pump has clicked off, and he's waiting to be disconnected so he can leave.  I don't know if he even saw the cop.

What I do know is that, all that hand-to-hand training he got in academy fresh in his mind.  That one swing was all the suspect got, because he was immediately dumped on the ground and pinned down, while the cop yelled into his radio for back up.  My manager and I stood in shock, jaws somewhere down around our kneecaps.

What had been just one State Trooper getting gas was now one State Trooper conducting an arrest, and a State Trooper supervisor observing and acting as backup.  My manager, another attendant who hadn't been involved at all up to this point, and myself figured it would be a good idea to back off and let the cops do their thing.  Customers weren't going to be pulling up anyway, not with a bunch of red and blue lights flashing everywhere.  I also suggested making popcorn, but got vetoed.  Always gotta ruin the fun.

So the suspect is now being interviewed, and the cop who was hip-deep in the car slowly backs out with a very large bag.  Think a quart freezer bag that's been filled with air so it's the shape of a pillow.  And inside is a black, semi-liquid substance.  Ya know, kinda looks like heroin.  Someone grab a test kit.

Yup.  Heroin.  Two and a half pounds of it.

Now several more units show up, and he REALLY needs to go.  Over and over and over again, like a broken record of the album *Interview Nervousness* by the band Career Hunter.  Sorry bro, that's really not going to get you out of this one.  He was arrested, the car was towed away, and we basically didn't do any business for about 30 minutes.  And I never got any popcorn.

**A Tale of Two Idiots**

It was the best of times, cooler than our white, semi retarded president from Texas.  The Olympics that year were already a faded memory, except for that one guy who won like 40 medals for swimming and smoked pot. USA USA USA!  A man was impregnated.  Beyonce was advising men across the nation that if you like it, then you should indeed, put a ring on it.  The terrible scourge that we now know as ""Beiber Fever"" was in the future, and we were all blissfully unaware of how it would come and sweep the nation.

Oh and there was this financial crisis thing you may have heard about. Probably not. It was WOEFULLY under reported in the media.  It's only our stock market collapsing after all.  Stories about a guy who used to be a woman getting pregnant are much more interesting and important

Anyways, that Red sucks, and Blue will always triumph. Even if we have a teamkiller named Caboose on our side.  

Anyways, the company was ecstatic because apparently they had never heard of this little site Amazon.com. If you haven't either I suggest checking them out. It's a gamble, being as they are so small, but its definitely worth it.

Anyways, looking like Big Bird in my Khaki pants and Bright Yellow polo.  Like a sexy, sexy Big Bird of Justice!  When off at customer service, I hear a commotion.  What is this?  Danger afoot! DRUNKEN_BLACK_BELT AWAY!

I had my co worker watch the cameras and doors while I walked over to see who was yelling and cursing up in my store, yelling at an associate, who was as equally red faced out of frustration.  Now this co worker was a nice enough guy. Showed up for each shift on time, did his work, was pleasant to talk to. He just wasn't smart.  I mean this kid was so dumb, he was about as sharp as a marble.  Believe me when I tell you this kid was so dumb that he thought that OJ really was innocent.  If you showed him how to do something, gave him a little hands on experience, and was fine. But if anything deviated from that training

So I naturally assumed he was trying to do something he wasn't sure about and too shy to ask for help.  Getting berated by this poor customer wasn't helping

As I walked over

Angry Man: Are you a manager?  Can you help me with this idiot?

Now he still had anger spittle dangling from his lips as he said this.  Meanwhile, I may not have been the LP that store deserved, but I was the LP that store needed....

Me: Sir

AM: Well I want to return this item

Me:  Sir

AM: Whatever

AM: Ok

TJ: I scan it

Now, all I wanted to do was punch TJ in the face, and then follow it up with a swift kick to the balls of the customer, to make sure he can never reproduce idiot spawn.  For you see, the packaging for the item in question was a brand that was owned, and sold, exclusively at Circuit City. And next to the product itself, with the words CIRCUIT CITY clearly printed on the top of it.

A long moment passed.  Maybe this was a prank?  Am I being Punk'd

Alas, another with his head so far up his ass that he'd have to cut his own nipples off just to see.

Me: Well

AM: What? 

Me: Well, you can both clearly this receipt says ""Circuit City"" at the top.  Also this item was made for, and sold exclusively at Circuit City.  So that's probably the issue.

TJ at this point looked like he was going to die of embarrassment.  I felt bad

Angry Man looks at TJ and with a voice of superiority says ""And you couldn't figure that out? You had to have someone help you?""

I honestly felt like my brain was going to pop.  I thought after hearing something so stupid, my mind is strong, and my mental fortitude allowed me go on.

Me: Sir

AM: Well yea!

Me:........

AM: YOUR POINT?

Me: My point is that you're calling him an idiot

AM: I KNEW! But I brought it here to return it!

Me: Yea. But it's a competitor's item.

AM: Yea a competitor who is closed now!

Me: Yes.

AM: Good so you see my point!

At this point

Me: I'm sorry, and why?

AM:  Jesus christ.  Circuit City is closed.  I can't return my items there anymore.  You guys are still open. So you can do their returns.

Me: No

AM: Well why wouldn't you? You'll get the money they lost.

Me:.... No. You spent money there and got a product.  Then if you returned it here

AM: Listen just because you work retail doesn't mean you know how business works.

Me: Oooooook.  Yea listen, there is no way to do it, as we can't accept this item into our stock, or give you the same exact item.  Follow?

AM: Get your manager. 

I sent TJ to find a manager.  If this guy was left alone with TJ I'm sure he'd continue to berate him.  I just sat and stared while the guy mumbled under his breath and glared at me.  Luckily, and a great guy. Old school Italian guy who was easy to get along with, took care of his employees, and knew the business.

Manny walks over, and this is why he never shopped here. He just didn't have a choice now because Circuit City was closed. Manny just laughed, and said that if he was indicative of the customers that Circuit City catered too, no wonder they went out of business.  AM got angry, and said ""You just lost a big customer!""  

Naturally Manny just laughed and said ""You never shopped here. How did we lose you if you weren't a customer?""

Eleanor's preferred method of shopping was to come in, and demand employees bring her certain clothes.  She'd literally wave down the closest employee and demand ""Bring me a skirt.  Something colorful.""  or ""Bring me a jacket.""

Normally, so having one employee dedicated to just her was occasionally difficult.  On one particularly busy day when I had a few call offs, I knelt down beside her and quietly said ""I'm really sorry Eleanor, but I don't have the staff to bring you clothes today.""

She stared at me

We also had issues with her mistaking other customers for employees

Eleanor was constantly planning trips.  We kept dossiers on our best customers

Eleanor would veto clothes for ridiculous reasons.  ""Those flowers are too flowery."" she'd say to a skirt.  But we quickly found that if you took something away

One day Eleanor asked for a skirt.  She had me hold it in front of her, then closed her eyes.  Then told me to take it away and bring another. 

We went through this look then look away routine with a few different garments before I finally just asked what she was doing.

Her sister in law

That little episode started a new stage in Eleanor's shopping.  She would still demand clothes, alternating between looking at her own reflection and closing her eyes in let's pretend.  ""Can you picture me wearing this on the sands of Aruba?"" she'd ask.  We'd all agree it was Aruba sands appropriate.

One day she was looking for something that was good for Italy.  We had some marketing from the previous fall laying around that was Tuscany themed

Then came the day that we got a new employee in.  She went to Eleanor's church.  I'm sure everyone in retail has had a moment where someone hasn't recognized you out of context.  This was one of those moments.  

Eleanor is sitting there, Eleanor.  You know none of that is true.""

There's a stunned silence.  Eleanor's eyes go wide.  She tries on her things, quietly.

We find out from my employee Eleanor was the much younger wife of a man she had known for years.  Yes, he'd been retired for years.  The vacations?  Pretty much all not true.

Eleanor though, she'd spin her stories.  If she was, she'd buy one or two things quietly.

Then one day, tags still in place.  All bought to support her personal fantasy world.  

Her husband wanted us to deny her service from that day on.  We couldn't do that, maybe two items per visit.

But when you were alone with her back in the fitting suite

Eleanor quietly dropped off of our best customers list.",self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1h7q7e/eleanor_none_of_that_is_true/

* The first notably bad employee they hired was a kid of about 16 years old, but it gets worse.

   CK was incredibly lazy. He was hired primarily to work with me in stocking shelves and carrying heavy things out to customers' cars. Normally, and plop down in the back and play on his phone. Now occasionally the stock boys would play the ""not it!"" or the ""nose goes"" game when it came to carryouts, and every once in a while it was fine. But CK took advantage of this, and every time he heard the intercom beep, before the page even started, he'd yell out ""not it!"" and refused to do anything that involved him moving.

   The last straw was when he came into work all excited that he had just bought a new blade for his box cutter. He decided to demonstrate for me just how sharp this blade was by slicing off the top of what else, and it did a great job slashing a 3"" gash in the side of his hand. He was rushed to the hospital for stitches, came back the next day and tried to claim worker's compensation for an injury while on the job, lying about how he had cut himself. I had already told my managers what had actually happened, and his claim was denied. He was fired shortly after. Total time of employment: 2 months.

* The next gem of an employee comes from the pet department. After CK got fired, flop his Pillsbury Doughboy belly up on the cages, and start bitching about how hard he worked and how he deserved a raise and how he just wanted to go home and play GTA.

   BFF's downfall came on a Saturday morning. He had been told by my boss to get the mouse cages cleaned Thusday, as BFF was supposed to get them done. Saturday rolls around and these cages still hadn't been cleaned. BFF dicked around all morning until lunch time, he clocks out, and as he lumbers by the animal room, he lets loose the single sentence that to this day still makes my blood boil.

   ""Hey legomaniac89

   I stood there in absolute shock for a moment as the rage built up inside of me. I was more pissed than I think I have ever been

* Next in the lineup is Desperate Creeper Chick. DCC was in her mid-20s, she could have been a real-life version of Lumpy Space Princess. She would repeatedly ask every employee moderately close to her age range (myself included) if they wanted to come over to her house for a ""sleepover"". After being shut down over and over by everyone in the store, she started asking any customers that she found remotely attractive the same thing. Needless to say, this didn't go over so well with people, and when the awkward ""I think your employee is hitting on me"" complaints began to roll in, DCC was canned. Total time of employment: 3 weeks.

1365188023.0,1br122,Why I quit working for a computer retailer OR The night Oddjob tried to kill me,m1kepro,576,83,48,"Six and a half years ago, the practice of patting us down where customers could see because someone was stealing from Back of House... all good reasons. But let me tell you about the day that made me decide that I can no longer be in the business of retail-oriented customer service.

Three nights before Christmas, so he could go to the doctor. I agreed, because I always like to do a friend a favor. As it turned out, the antacids he was taking weren’t helping his stomach pains because he needed emergency surgery to remove his appendix.

My manager, I had to take my original shift too. I didn’t blame my co-worker, but I think the manager could have at least *attempted* to bring someone else in for that closing shift.

So the night drags on. Most of my work is fairly mundane. Replace an mp3 player, etc. But I’m dragging. I’m starting to make little mistakes after completing 22 of my 26 hours of work over the course of that two days.

Finally, and they all decided that little Timmy would hate them forever if he didn’t have the latest MP3 player or smartphone under the tree. So the store is all of a sudden flooded, and those of us behind the *long wooden high-top table in the back of the store* are asked to come out and help customers.

There’s only one guy scheduled for an appointment, this guy... let’s call him Ted... comes in and just stands there staring at a computer. He’s not touching it, not reading anything. Just staring at it. I wander over to him, and give him the normal routine. At this *non-descript, nameless computer company*, you never ask “Can I help you?” or other questions that could end a conversation with a single word. So you just engage the customer and start conversing about whatever it is they’re looking at. Ingratiate yourself.

He waves me away, so I go back behind the *long wooden high-top table*, check to see if my guest has checked in. He hasn’t, so I shout out above the noise “Ted? Is there a Ted in the house? Ted F.!”

No response. So I go back to helping customers. Well, who I’d talked to just before, and starts berating me in front of my customer about why I didn’t get ahold of him. I try to explain that I did talk to this man, he waved me away, and then I shouted for Ted for a solid thirty seconds from behind the *long wooden high top table*. Manager Fred (also a fake name) won’t hear it.

So I resolve to deal with Manager Fred later, he’s in no mood to deal with my “attitude problem.” He reaches into his bag and pulls out a 17” notebook computer with an aluminum case that’s been dinged to hell. I ask him what the problem seems to be, and he begins to rant. It’s too long to write here, so I’ll just touch the major points. Only two months old, screen “suddenly broke” while he was asleep, shoddy workmanship, battery “only” lasts five hours

I open the screen and press the power key. The screen lights up, stylus, tiny marital aid, or some other device on the keyboard and had tried to close the lid. I carefully examined the machine, just trying to buy time because I knew he wouldn’t react well to what I was going to tell him, then took a deep breath and plunged in.

“Sir, but because this is accidental damage, it isn’t covered by your ThingCare plan.”

Those were the magic words. All of a sudden, and this computer was working just fine, and he doesn’t even *own* a pen, and how dare I accuse him of being so stupid, and a hundred other things.

I wait for him to finish, but as you can see on the LCD-” to which he replies by screaming at me about how I need to get off the drugs and stop hallucinating before I come to work. “I’m sorry, sir. That’s LCD, not LSD. As you can see, the LCD has two distinct points where the ends of a long, thin cylindrical object came in contact with the screen and crushed it. That’s why there’s these jagged points. It’s like how a windshield spiderwebs if a rock bounces on the highway and hits it.”

Well, which failed spectacularly.

Manager Fred attempts to tell Ted the same thing I did, Ted shouts “That’s **NOT** accidental damage! **THIS** is accidental damage!”

He picks up his 17” computer by a corner, who saw the guy throw the notebook at me and tackled him to the ground.

After an arrest for assault and attempted battery, and all sorts of other mess, I’m now well over my 26 hours of work and into hour 28, and the store is still yet to be cleaned up for closing. I clear it with my fellow workers, then go to the office in Back of House and ask Manager Fred if I can be excused early as I’ve just suffered a near injury and a terrifying experience, and the adrenaline I was running on has run out.

Manager Fred launches into a truly insulting speech about my incompetence in defusing situations,” he notices I’ve got my iPhone (first-gen, gifted to me by my former company when it premiered) out and asks what the hell I’m doing.

I reply “I just put in my two weeks via email, and the next morning I went to the labor offices for my state’s government and filed a report. Manager Fred was called in for a hearing some short days later. Of course, he lied his ass off, even attempting to say I never turned in a resignation letter.

I proved I did by showing them the email on my phone, gave Fred a mocking bow so that I came down to his height, and walked out. The pay was direct deposited into my account the day after the hearing.

So that’s my story. Never told that one in it’s full form before. Thank you guys for the opportunity to get that night off my chest

The first

This event took place last spring while I was working as a cashier at the Orange competitor of the store of the previous story. 

It was just me and the Head Cashier up at the registers, I'm doing my job as efficiently as pleasantly as I could and then this guy shows up in my line with three products. Innocent enough. He has his son with him, and his son is probably about 26-28, so this guy was early-mid 60s, so we'll just call him CWAK (Creeper with a Kid).

I start ringing CWAK's stuff and do the pretty standard 'Did you find everything all right today?' and of course, 'No. I need a phone number.' 

So

CWAK of course doesn't realise that this was indeed a cue to CUT THAT SHIT OUT so he decides to clarify that it was indeed my phone number he was looking for. At this point

I politely indicate that that is not available. And CWAK continues pressuring

Eventually this guys stops his shit and realises that he's not getting my phone number by just asking so he tries as different technique. The really fucked up compliment-like-insult.

""I bet your parents are really disappointed in a girl like you working retail at your age. Don't worry

Ew. I'm so appalled now that I can't respond. My head cashier is giving me the 'Do I need to step in?' look. But before I can indicate one way or the other I get.

""Wow. Just look at how red you are."" Then he calls over to his son ""Look at how embarassed she is!""

In other words, and for simplicity's sake let's just say she was going to get $20 back

BUT WHERE'S THE FUNNY?

The funny came 10 minutes later, beefy, stubby hands. Homeboy slams the battery down on the counter and just lays into me about ""ripping off his wife."" I was used to this kind of treatment, because I was in the shithole south and nobody is nice to clerks at return desks. I ask him to explain the dealio and he pulls out the receipt and *shoves* it in my face. ""Where my $20 credit!""

Oh joy.

I show the man where I had applied $20 in cash at the bottom, not a discount on the battery's regular price. He just didn't get it. AT ALL. Homey kept getting louder and louder, accused me of pocketing the $20 and making his wife pay the full price, typical moron bullshit.

Then it happened. 

After the umpteenth attempt to explain that the reason he saw two cash entries in the tender section

He hucked it straight at my chest. I jumped back and spun to the side but it still caught my upper arm and left a hella-nasty bruise on it. The car battery landed on the floor and promptly began spewing/leaking/bleeding ACID everywhere. I look back at Giganto

They all come running, and while they did determine I did everything by store policy, the one manager bends the truth just a hair (making up some nonsense procedural mistake I had ""made"") so Giganto could, in theory, exit the situation with a little dignity. I'm used to this tactic, so I apologize for the (completely made-up) ""error"".

That's when round two started. Giganto's wife was back in the store by now, etc. Long story short: Giganto swore to God he was never come back to our store, because it was full of liars and cheats. I had a nasty bruise on my arm for a while, and the floor behind the returns desk was ruined. We reviewed the security tapes later and my direct boss couldn't believe my sweet Matrix-style moves.

1368034789.0,1dxz92,How my best friend and coworker got brutally assaulted by a grown man in our store,pleasenoonions,563,79,79,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I work in a small clothing store that is present in most malls. Because we sell brands that are affiliated with drugs and sometimes gang related emblems, a coworker of mine and assistant manager of the store was working alone from open-five. She is petite, 5'1"" and no more than 120 pounds. We are going to call her Jane. Due to our company policy, approaching shoplifters must be with respect and kindness. We may only offer to hold their items that were clearly stuffed in their bag up at the front for them. Basically, every approach towards a shoplifter must be riddled with a ""customer service"" angle. Anyway, back to the story. So in walks two guys, regular shoplifters. We identify one of them in conversation with eachother as ""kiss lip tattoo guy"" as he (and the rest of his inferred gang) have a tattoo of a red kiss mark on their necks.  This guy comes in all the time and gets away with boatloads of clothes. He is the slickest motherfucker. 

So Lip Kiss guy grabs some camo skinny jeans and asks for a fitting room. Jane lets him in. When he comes out, obviously looking for a hiding spot. She walks over to him, puts on her fake smile, stands about six feet away and says 

J: Did you find that on the floor? I can take that for you and put it in our bin.

KLG: What the fuck are you talking about?

J: The sensor in your hand

KLG: I dont have nothin' in my hands (he says

J: Well

Kiss Lip Guy then turns around so that his back is facing her

Jane fell to the ground from the force of the punch after her neck whipped around, he comes after her AGAIN. He turns around, running at her, fists ready. At this point, a man working at another store runs out and creates a barrier between Kiss Lip Guy and Jane, and this sends Kiss Lip Guy running. A pack of mall workers chase after him and got his license plate number. Jane is feeling really terrible at this point, obviously in pain. And the pain is even greater because not a week earlier Jane got a concussion while doing manual labor by herself at work and our company made her work a twelve hour shift the very next day. 


The best part about this fucked up story? Jane got punched around 3 o clock. She immediately called our District Manager (as our store is without any managers right now besides Jane who is a mere assistant still in her teen years) and she explained the situation to Our DM while crying and obviously shaken up. Our DM's response? ""Haha, what a savior. Thanks for the five mins off, amirite? Should be enough time to recover from being physically assaulted by a grown man! 

Eight o clock rolls around, thanks. 

Jane then has to work two days after this incident, as I said, in a gang (the police confirmed this from his record of past assaults and gang affiliation) and she feared for her safety. I don't fucking blame her. Our DM then called her threatening her saying that if she quits then ""she cannot use [Store] as a reference."" Really? Worked here for three years and she can't use the store as a reference because she feels unsafe and doesn't want to be there anymore?

1368951170.0,1emf1c,A tale from a customer at the furniture store.,skaschmidt,555,71,49,"First time posting here, like today

So I'm at the furniture store picking out a chair. I decide on the one I like (has 4 legs, average quality but a good price, you know the deal) and I place the order for the chair I want at the counter.

The kind young lady said ""That's all fine, as I'm sure these simple instructions must baffle numerous customers each day.
Take receipt to back of store

So I drive around to the back of the store, and I'm walking towards the door when I hear from the woman in the front, let's call her WIF:

WIF: ""Excuse me

To which I reply: ""That's fine

A young lad (YL)

YL: ""Hey mate

Me: ""Well thanks

YL: Looks at recepit ""Ok man...Oh, I just have to move a few things to get to it.""

Me: ""Yeah

In an instant

WIF: ""Why haven't I got my things yet?!""

YL: ""I'm sorry

WIF: Confused ""What?""

YL: ""I need your receipt to see what you purchased

WIF: ""They just told me to drive round here and you'd give me my stuff!""

YL: ""Oh I'm sorry

WIF: ""Ugh!"" as she troddles back to her car.

By now the other two customers had remembered that the cashier told them to hand the receipt in

As she hands it into YL she states:
""Just so you know, then the couple, and this guy, (pointing at me) who got here first, is the last.""

And then it happened.
YL gave me that look. I'm sure all of us in service have given that look. The unspoken eye contact where we both know what's going on that just says ""seriously?"".

Me: ""Yeah, so take your time.""

WIF: ""Well I AM in a hurry! AND I've already been waiting here 25 minutes! (although she told me it was 10 minutes about 2 minutes ago) SO I GET MY STUFF FIRST!""

YL: Looks at her receipt ""You purchased this at the counter 2:04

WIF: ""Yeah

The looks between all of us now were priceless.

YL: Being polite enough not to make here look even more foolish ""Well I'm very sorry

YL hops on his forklift and we all return to our cars. A minute later he returns with what seems to be some nursery furniture for the mother with the baby. I'm two cars length from WIF but I can still hear her claiming ""But I was first"" and ""That's her job

Young mother drives off.

And then there were three.

I was pretty sure I knew what was going to happen next

But nope. Out YL comes with an outdoor dining set for the couple in the middle.

WIF: ""Aw

YL: As he's passing her ""Yeah

WIF: ""Uuuurrrrrgghhhh!"" Like she had just stubbed her toe. 

YL: Who is now clearly giving no fucks and just wants to rub some salt in those bitchy wounds ""I'm sorry

WIF: Some under her breath muttering

YL: ""What was that

WIF: ""Just Hurry. THE. FUCK. UP!""

This woman is now so irate

Now it's just me and WIF. And while YL is in the warehouse

WIF: ""He better not bring your stuff back now
Me: ""Umm...No

WIF: ""Why not?!""

I'm pretty sure even she knew how stupid this question was after I gave her a confused look and chose not to answer.

The heat was now on, shaking her head. It was like someone had just told her  that someone had stolen her identity and used her credit cards to purchase shitty furniture and they also had to wait in line.

And then it happened. The knight in shining fluorescent returns with his forklift carrying one single chair. He rode straight past WIF

WIF: ""You have got to be fucking shitting me!""

YL just pays no attention as he very carefully helps me load up my chair.

Me: ""I know how it is man

YL: ""Yep. And it just happens to be my smoke break now

We both shared a little chuckle as obscenities were being screamed in our direction.

I drove of with a sense of joy, it was a good transaction.

Long time lurker


**BACKGROUND:** I work as a Box Office Assistant for a well-known theatre in the UK. We have 3 venues within the theatre and at least 5 shows a day (including stand-up comedy


The way that a customer can collect their pre-paid tickets is simple. We ask *What show are you here for?*. Customer replies. We then ask *And what's your surname?*. Customer replies. We find their tickets in the box marked with the show name. The we ask *Can you please confirm your postcode..?*. Customer confirms the postcode. We hand over the tickets. They go enjoy their show. We get on with the rest of the waiting customers. Simples.


Except when apparently we are not seen as people...


I had one customer this evening that was just so rude and necessary that it made me question how some people get through a day treating other as they do.


I saw this guy walk up to the desk: Tall, visibly gay (you know the type) and he was eating a sandwich.


Now it's annoying enough when someone is eating at the desk


He approached the desk and shoved his credit card straight in my face while he was stuffing his face. I calmly made eye contact and asked what show he was here for. He once again just pushed his card in my face. I tried to look around it and asked again. He had finished his bite and so he very kindly answered me. So I asked him his surname, in the most condescending, rude manner that I nearly wanted to refuse him service, because it had been that kind of **week**. But I kept my calm and got his tickets. He then tries to grab them out of hand, but I manage to keep hold of them. I then ask him to confirm his post code.


The look he gave me was one of absolute shock and horror. It was like I was asking for his first born...


So I say *""You just need to confirm your postcode for security reasons""*. And he just looks at me. Leans in and says:


&gt; ""I'M EATING!""


Right in my face. Sandwich flies out of his mouth and hits my face. At this point my colleague [lets call him PC] who was manning the register beside me


A very kind lady came up and gave me a napkin to wipe my face. I was shaking at this point. PC radioed the DM who was there straight away. PC told her what had happened


The next thing I heard were shouts from the stairwell


And then he said those magic words: ""This isn't the end

To which the security man replied: ""Great


I then went on my break and just about broke down.


I've had unpleasant customers in the past, but this is the first one that really affected me on a personal level.

I worked at a rather busy gas station in a quite rich neighborhood for several years.  I was the closing cashier (rich people near an Interstate think that a 24-hour gas station would bring in ""undesirables"") which actually gave me quite a bit of authority.  The Manager usually left around 4pm, which was the convenience store, the 12 pumps, the parking lot, and the car wash (which will figure into this story).

It was a rather nice spring day, through the gas pumps, and parks in a fairly incongruous angle in front of the doors to the store.  Out jumps an older lady, somewhere in her late 60s, dressed like she was trying out for Meryl Streep's part in The Devil Wears Prada.  Kinda looked like Streep, too.  She marched toward the doors with a ""*this transgression shall not stand*"" look on her face.  I steeled myself, and put on the CS fake smile.

Sadly, but the upshot was that she was QUITE displeased with how clean her car was after going through the car wash.  I apologized, and offered to run her through again for free, which was Standard Reply #1 for anyone having an issue with the car wash.  Ah, but that just won't do.  Okay, Standard Reply #2 was to offer to cut her into the head of the line, something we didn't like doing because it made all the other customers mad.  But that wouldn't do, refund the money.  Nope

I'm now perplexed.  What did she want me to do?  Which is what I asked her.  Instead of getting an idea of whatever it was that she wanted done told to me, our intelligence levels, why we found it necessary to hire high schoolers, and several choice coarse epithets that drew concerned and irritated looks from the two other women who were in the store with their children.

At this point, but added that she wanted to know what *I* was going to do about this.  I responded with ""I don't know, ma'am, you haven't told me what you would like to happen.""  This, of course, set her off on another tirade, but I was now the full focal point of her anger.  The more general comments she'd made earlier were now very specific insults about my intelligence, and my value as a human being.  With several swear words thrown around quite a bit.

Now, I was working at a gas station.  I was in school, working on my second degree.

Customer Service smile dropped away, exception the biological one) that if she insisted on insulting me and the station, and swearing in front of customers and their children, then we didn't want her business any more, that she was to leave, and that any further contact would have to go through the GM.

I'll give you a moment to allow your imagination to come up with a suitable idea of her reaction.  I'll give you a hint

So now I went from calm to rather loudly commanding her to leave the premises or else I would be calling the police.  To which she seemed completely nonplussed, I don't bluff when I say I'm gonna call in backup.  So I made the call.  (Another bit of backstory, the local police LOVED our store, because we were one of the few places they could come get snacks at prior to graveyard shift, and we called in DUII drivers to them on a regular basis).

Five minutes later, comes into the store.  I gave him the ""holy hell, this idiot REALLY needs to be smacked and tossed out of here"" look, and he gave me a ""what, the she-hag?  She's that much trouble?"" look back.  She then turned and lit into the officer about what happened, lying the whole time.  She said that I had threatened her, that I had used racial and sexual slurs, which was *obviously* theft.  The officer turned and looked at me

The officer escorted the lady outside, and that she could talk to the GM in the morning, but I didn't want to deal with her ever again.  The officer smiled knowingly, and walked back outside.

What followed was the officer telling her that, and that since I was an employee here and had told her to leave, she had to leave.  Period.

I'm kind of surprised that the lady's head didn't just explode right there due to high blood pressure.  She started screaming at the cop, keeping his cool, asked her three separate times if she was willing to leave.  She wouldn't directly reply to the question, just kept screaming.

So he arrested her for criminal trespass.  She did not go quietly.  I applauded.

Now, her rage slowly turned into dawning realization as she was driven to jail, and she began to plead with the officers to be let go.  When they declined, she tried to name drop by stating that her husband was a circuit court judge for the very county we were in.

Which turned out to be true!

So it became a minor bit of local drama.  Since she was, none of the other judges in the county could try her case due to conflict of interest.  Not just that county, but two others as well, seeing as how she was a social climber and therefore was heavily involved in social events, elections, political groups, and such.  She had to be tried in court almost 100 miles away.  She plead guilty, and did 100 hours of community service (which, retired early and divorced her.  I never saw her again after the trial.  My boss gave me a raise for ""dealing well with a difficult situation"" and a paid day off.  I spent that day at the beach

So, crazy, 911-is-getting-called-at-some-point stories, I'm going to share a story that happened just after I stopped working at that station which should help me feel better, and restore just a tad bit of faith in people for everyone else.

In July of that year, had just slipped into a coma, and probably wouldn't make it through the weekend) and the manager had no choice but to send ol' Osiris a pink slip.  I don't look good in slips, and pink is SO last year.  Seriously, keep up with fashion trends!

Anyway, and my grandmother (the other one, the one in a coma didn't make it through the weekend.  She was 104, and I miss her terribly) lived just a mile away.  So I was in the area visiting on a regular basis.  The station had good prices for gas and a decent beer selection, so I would stop in and chat.

As I turned on to the cul de sac, this isn't normal.""  I looked around, but couldn't see any police cars, firetrucks, ambulances, or other governmental/emergency vehicles that may provide a clue as to what's going on.  So I park, walk over to the corner of the store out of camera shot, and proceed to try and overhear what's going on.

The reporter, I didn't see anyone with him aside from the camera man and a rather bored-looking broadcast tech.  Strange.  Stubbing out my cancer stick, I walk into the store to see a couple of my old co-workers.  They are BEAMING.  Not that stupid forced customer service smile we've all had to shove onto our faces like a bad Dia de los Muertos mask, but real, honest smiles of joy.

""Okay guys

One of the guys then explains what's been happening all day.  Early in the morning, waiting for the next car to arrive.  As it drove up, he walked around to where the attendant was talking to the driver.  The man held up his hand to stop the conversation, pulled out a $100 bill from his pocket, and said, ""fill them up, it's on me.""

And he had been doing that

The station had become quite busy about an hour after the guy showed up, but the man was pointed out to me, still standing out there at the pumps, talking with one of the attendants.  I asked the cashier why.

Apparently

The reception by the community was shock, obviously, someone had tipped off the local news, because they were down there covering the story for the evening news.

Not everyone had taken him up on his offer.  A few had declined so that one more person other than them could get it.  A few standoffish people didn't want anyone thinking they were getting charity.  But the vast majority of people simply thanked the man and left the station

I never found out how much the guy spent that day, so it wasn't cheap for him at all.  I also don't know where he kept the money, since even in $100s that would mean a pretty damn thick stack of cash.  All I know is that it was a beautiful thing to do, that his name was Dave, and that for one day he made a lot of people happy.

He wants a small water and two lemons. On the tray, not in the water. He takes two creams and three sugars. Three. Not four, Not two. Three. One plastic stirrer. And he wants three napkins. Placed on his tray, away from the lemons. 

This order nets the store the grand total of $1.03. And God help you if you get any of that wrong. 

At first, and all of a sudden he could speak just fine.

I found this out when the senior card program decided that card holders had to pay tax for their free drink. I had no idea until I rang him up and it came to $1.06.

HE. LOST. HIS. FUCKING. MIND.

He went ballistic. Suddenly I could understand every word out of his mouth. Most of them were insults to my mother. The word ""asshole"" got a lot of use too. Other customers around the restaurant are prairie dogging: Heads are popping up. I try to cut in. ""Sir

Okay, Bill has quieted down some. The guy he was arguing with went from respectful but annoyed to flaming mad and ready to kick ass. I think Bill sensed he was getting close to having that hip break. He turned and made his way towards the door, like some foul mouthed tortoise. I breathed a sigh of relief. 

Two days later, right? I didn't totally throw her under the bus. I told her everything I could in the three minutes it would take him to make it inside. Grab the tray, lemons, napkins. She gets the water. Ring in the sandwich. Don't pour the coffee yet, he'll say it's cold. Two creams, three sugars. He's getting close. Fish will be up right in time to ring him through. Out of sight. We got this. 

He makes it up to the counter. He gets the welcome. ""Hrmrmrm"". ""The regular today? Coming right up."" she turns and gets the fish. I stand nearby making happy meal boxes. Watching. Waiting for this to get bad. She totals. $1.06. No reaction. Thank God. Lemons far away from napkins. Good. She sets the coffee on the tray. He grabs it

She drops to the floor, grabs Bill's shirt. He puts his arms up. She steps inside his hip, and judo tosses him to the floor. 911 is called. 

These many years later

1372605579.0,1hd8fs,Generosity is not all its cracked up to be...,sinspider,565,113,36,"More tales from the comic shop. This one in particular has stuck with me very clearly over the years and frankly is one im sure that most people in retail that have stores that 'hold' stock can relate to. Tl:DR at bottom

In my last year at the store we were taken over by new owners (again) and frankly they were rather nice. South african family who were straight shooters and albeit did things differently

Our store meant that your could pre-order figurines before they were made

I started going through a lot of these orders and discovered that a number of customers had been taking advantage of these extended collection period and would not pay for and/or pick things up for 6 months or greater. More when they felt they had the spare money

I took it upon myself to start chasing a lot of these people up to collect their shit or at least start making consistent payments on it instead of just the minimum (deposit) and if they didn't it would be put on sale for another customer. 

For the most part customers were appreciative. Many had forgotten they had ordered it or were embarrassed to have been taken advantage for so long

eg sinspider: most places will only hold orders for a week or less and you've had this in storage for 4 months with no additional money paid etc and if i had not called you likely would have forgotten about it at all so at least we had the courtesy to call you.
customer:...ill be in this afternoon

Anyway

This woman was also one whom knew when our busiest periods of the month were but would still call up and keep one of the staff on the phone for half an hour or more looking for specific issues of specific comics and then drive straight to the store expecting that they would all be waiting for her in the 5 minutes it took her to get there. She did this to me twice. 

FM: I want all these things. (list as long as my forearm)

Sinspider: sure thing but you understand most of these comics have not been in print for many months

FM: sure thing

(fast forward **7minutes**)

FM (at counter behind other customer): **loud sigh**

FM (reaching counter): **exasperated sigh** so have you put everything aside for me?

Sinspider: um...i told you on the phone that we were extremely busy and i have not left this counter since you rang me. Id be happy to go looking for you and see what i can find but it may take some time.

FM: so go.

(containing rage

I have found maybe half the list after neglecting every other customer in a very busy period to help FM and the rest we simply dont have in stock (from over 9000 comics) and cannot order in. FM lets out a loud sigh every time i don't walk up to her with the counter with her entire order

Back to the 18 month old orders. It turns out she was coming in and picking up the 'must have' pieces every 6 months (still way over what we allowed) and leaving other pieces behind. I called her up and the conversation followed as thus:

Sinspider: Hi FM

FM: **abuse and more abuse and then some occasional words** I paid for a deposit and i continue to order from you guys you have no right those are legally mine i will take you to court if you try and take them from me.

Sinspider: True you paid a deposit for them but you have not paid any further amount since then

FM: **abuse followed by your doing this because im a woman** 

Sinspider: FM i have just told you exactly what our policy is and you can take it from me and my bosses that no longer are any freeloaders taking advantage of our policies anymore. 

FM: **FUCK YOU**
*hangs up*

I thought i was going to be in trouble from the newer owners for how i handled the call. Instead they were happy for me dealing with her for taking up an entire shelf with items that weren't profitable. I find out later that she came in the next day. Picked up the cheapest figure that she had (**$40**) and abused the staff again and continued to do so after purchase. I arrived on my shift to see this abuse carrying on. Not knowing who she was told her to GFTO of the store and not come back and she recognized my voice. She leaves the store and doesn't meet my gaze and we dont hear from her again.  

Her crap gets put back out for sale and all sold within the next week earning the owners some $600 from her deposits that were nullified and some of her figures were worth even more netting them $1500 total. And thus earning me my new title of Comic book nazi. I wore it proudly and no regular customer ever fucked with me again for fear of loosing their stuff.

I work at a home-deco/fabric store. In my department (fabrics) we have 6 rows of shelves to display the fabrics we have for sale. The first row is for the clearance/discount fabrics that we need to get rid of. the other 5 are for the regular priced items. Atop the large discount shelf sits a large sign that reads: ""CLEARANCE FABRICS

 Every now and then, ogle at it for a little, maybe let his/her kids bite and piss on it, take it on a little stroll throughout the store, and leave it (unrolled, of course) on the bargain shelf. This is a story of what happens to naughty boys and girls that don't read the price tags and signs in stores.

This happened about a week ago. Dialogue is recreated from memory. Most of it is correct.

By this point, a small crowd of people had paused their adventure in the mall to watch the bloody battle. Some of them even tried defending us, but for all their efforts, all they got was an angry: ""SHUT THE FUCK UP STAY OUT OF THIS""

After about four minutes of verbal ping-pong, all  they received were a bunch of barely comprehensible death and lawsuit threats.

The crowd of people started applauding and cheering, when out of nowhere, a teenage boy yelled just out of earshot: ""THE PRICE TAGS ARE THERE FOR A FUCKING REASON, LADY!""

For it to get this full means that no one has emptied it in days. Once it gets this full it is impossible to empty it without making a huge mess. Needless to say I was pissed. This isn't the first time my lazy coworkers have left this mess for me.

I decided enough was enough. I looked at our fry log sheet and see that that same coworker (Moody) has used that fry for the past four days. I get out a pen and paper and make a nice big note and write

""Empty your water tray. Don't just leave your mess for others""

I stick it on the fridge

The next day I go into work and notice my note had been taken down off the fridge. I mention it to my coworker and she says that she never saw a note this morning and that Moody or the Manager must have taken it down. I told her what my note said and what had happened the previous day. She then tells me what had happened that morning.

When Moody and the Manager came in for the day they presumably read my note. Moody then uses the same fryer that she had all the previous days. Doesn't check the water trough,over the floor.

A little while later after they left my store manager and I went outside to take a well earned break. He told me that the RM asked him how much of a raise she should give me, a seventy-five cent raise for me. This is absolutely huge. The day before yesterday I was approved for an apartment. I have never had a place strictly of my own before, I've only ever lived with my sister or people I was in a relationship with. I was feeling pretty worried about my potential to afford this place by myself, and so hearing this news out of the blue has alleviated much of my concern. I am also just really proud of the fact that someone at my workplace recognized the hard work I do, especially someone from the corporate end who is known for having high standards.

This happened around Easter time and I was working stock in the stationary department when a woman aged perhaps 40-50 years old walks up to me with some craft stationary items. Let us call her CL (Craft Lady).

**CL**: Excuse me but do you know which would work best on these eggs? Would it be pen, you see.

**Me**: Oh

**Me**: Well yes
(I had to keep myself calm at this time because of the snort of absolute derision she made at my answer.)

**CL**: How can you even work here if you don't know what you're talking about? How **dare** you sell craft items if you *aren't* an expert. Where is your manager? I want to speak with them **right now**.

**Me**: Ma'am

**CL**: **YOU** are a *MANAGER*?! No *wonder* this shop has no helpful staff if their **boss** is so f~king useless! 
(She then turns to the other customer in the aisle and begins to point at me and snort some more.)

**CL** ^(to the customer) : Can you *believe* this girl?! She's *lying* about being a manager! THE NERVE!

(Now this customer is a regular in my store and he is one of the quietest men I have ever met but she must have pushed his buttons because he spoke up for me. Let us call him Knight.)

**Knight**: Excuse me love

I work in technology sales and service so I do get to see a lot of customers. I get lots of sales and lots of questions

My first story is from last summer. I had just returned from a three week vacation backpacking in the mountains of New Mexico and Colorado. About two hours into my shift I get a phone call.

* Me: Hello, how may I help?
* Customer: Hello
* Me: We do offer a data backup service where we do just that

* Me: I am unaware of such a service
* Customer: Yes
* Me: Are you sure?
* Customer: Yes I remember reading it on your name tag.
* Me: I'm sorry

The customer then hung up.

The next story is at the tech counter of my store. A customer who I had sold a PC to roughly 6 months ago enters and puts his laptop down on the PC.

* Me: Hello
* Customer: I need you to fix my computer.
* Me: Ok let me take a look to see what is wrong.
--The PC would POST but would not go into windows.
* Me: Ok
Customer: I bought the PC here
--I was a little bit startled by his statement.
* Me: It could be an issue with either the hardware of software. I need to run some tests in order to find out what the exact problem is so that I can fix it.
* Customer: No I want it fixed NOW!!!
--The customer then performs verbal diarrhea on me explaining his life story and how the world has been woe to him. My somewhat-of-a-bonehead manager exits the office swinging his keys in hand. The customer points at me and is calling me incompetent in doing my job.
* Manager: Sir
* Customer: No
--My manager then explains that we can not help him
* Cashier: Have a good day sir!
* Customer: I'm never shopping at storename again!
* Cashier: Have a good day sir! 

I just loved how the girl working as cashier had no change in tone after he said that haha.

Today I got this call

* Me: Hello, how may I help?
--The customer had a thick long island accent
* Customer: Hi
* Me: Yes we have it on clearance for $320 dollars
* Customer: Ok
* Me: A trial version of Norton.
* Customer: That's it? I want Office.
* Me: Yes
* Customer: I the office for free
* Me: I'm sorry
* Customer: Why not?
--Yes I was just asked that....
* Me: I'm sorry
Customer: What do you offer in terms of setting the PC up.
* Me: We can do (I describe a bunch of services I'd do) for $100.
* Customer: I want you to do that for me for free like businessname does it.
--I know for a fact that the other business we compete with does not offer the service for free...
* Me: I'm sorry
* Customer: So let me get this straight
* Me: No
* Customer: I'll just go to businessname. Goodbye.

--She never did. Ironically later that day the customer came in and quietly bought the laptop anyway. My cashier told me a woman with a thick Long Island accent had just bought a certain PC

His mustache was astounding, like one you would find from the seventies, and his Coke bottle glasses accentuated the shine of anticipation and hope in his beady eyes.

Me: Oh

Him: She had Lupus.

Me: That’s very unfortunate.

Here is where the story actually begins. He goes on to explain to me that they had gotten married about ten years before, so she spent the her time in school, earning a bachelors and then a masters. Shortly after she got her masters, she was diagnosed with Lupus. They put her on steroids, as is the norm, and everything seemed to be mostly okay, except every time he talked to her she said the steroids made her fat and she had half a mind to stop taking them. He’d tell her, take your meds, the failure had started to reverse, and so on. A couple weeks later

This is where is gets kinda crazy.

Her family blames him for her death, doesn’t matter if it was shared or not, and want half the value of the house. Judging from the way he told the story, I believe they were harassing him and threatening to sue, not that they actually did sue, but I don’t know any of that for sure. So he packed up her personal belongings (family pictures, personal jewelry, and then donated the house and everything in it to charity, and was set to leave it all behind.

Now, “And don’t accuse me of being a heartless bastard, because she left me for her pant size.” Yes, sir.

After the story, and I, of course, had not forgotten him, but I was a little surprised when he waved at me and came over to the cash where I was. He thanked me because when he walked into the store last year he felt like he killed his wife, and when he started to tell me the story, he realized it was her decision and her doing, thanked me again

It was a weird experience all around

On my shift we have two waitresses (myself included)

We have a regular customer, really likes to hug female employees.  He is also slightly mentally handicapped, but is still functional enough to have obtained a commercial driver's license (he is a trucker) and live on his own.  Most of the other waitresses allow him to hug them and ""get it out of his system.""  (These being the same waitresses who sit on customers' laps and flirt heavily for tips, and see nothing wrong with staying with abusive or cheating boyfriends.  Not exactly women's rights advocates, here.)  I, on the other hand, really don't appreciate physical contact from strangers.  My usual coworker, feels the same way.

Now, grabbing them and pulling them in HARD if they don't reciprocate the hug.

After being taken aback and rather upset my first encounter and forced hug from Lenny, to no avail.  Extending my hand for a handshake was equally fruitless.  Planting my feet firmly on the ground to avoid being pulled in when he approached didn't work, either.  I'm barely 100 lbs and rather petite, so no matter what I did, I'd be physically overpowered and have my face smashed into Lenny's smelly, unwashed man-boobs while he fondled my bra-strap every time.  Angela and I would trade off on who had to wait on him, and neither of our strong nonverbal cues worked.  Whoever wasn't waiting on him had to hide in the back

A few weeks ago, offered to wait on him in my stead.  I was very grateful, and started sweeping up the back to keep myself busy and out of Lenny's sight.  As soon as Bruce approached Lenny with the menu, Lenny started yelling and cursing, saying he didn't want Bruce waiting on him and demanding to know where I was.  Bruce and the security guard managed to calm him down, and Bruce waited on him anyway.

Later that day, and pretty much thought we were lying.

Lenny came in again a few days later.  i was off for the night, she stepped back quickly and said, ""Please don't touch me.  I don't like hugs.""  Lenny started screaming and yelling, and made such a commotion that both the cook and the security guard approached and escorted him from the building.  Apparently my boss was informed, and had a talk with Lenny, telling him that he must respect the personal space of others, ask before hugging

Fast forward to two nights ago.  It's nearly 5am, and stands near the counter.  Aware of Angela's previous incident, I volunteer to wait on him, and approach him with a menu.  He walks around the counter, goes in to hug me, and places his hand on my back.  Being very careful to keep my tone and expression as pleasant as possible (figuring that he reacted poorly to Angela due to her brusqueness), I quietly say, sir.""

And that's when all Hell breaks loose.

Lenny starts yelling and screaming and cursing.  The only words I could make out were, he is practically nose-to-nose with me, screaming at an unbelievable volume and making threats and flailing his arms about.  He had clearly lost control, and I was fairly shocked and terrified.  Angela, who had walked up behind me by this point, grabs me by the elbow and yanks me through the doorway and out of sight.  The cook RUNS out to get the security guard.  Lenny continues his tirade until the security guard approaches and asks him to leave.  I can't see what is happening at this point, but I can hear Lenny start screaming even louder.  I hear a few loud THUDS and peek out to make sure the security guard is okay.  Lenny is throwing things and kicking things and knocking things over and having a violent tantrum near the front doors.  The few other customers are looking on in silence

The security guard, and is explaining to the dispatcher what is going on when the shift leader for the next shift, Liz, walks in.  Liz is a veteran waitress, having worked at this particular restaurant for over a decade, but is still shocked to see the commotion in the dining room.  She asks me about it, and I manage to blurt out that Lenny started raging when I asked him not to hug me.  Liz, walks out into the dining room and approaches Lenny.  I excuse myself outside at this point

When I returned a few minutes later, allowing him to hug her in the process, and assuring him that he wouldn't be denied any more hugs...which apparently calmed him down.  Angela was FUMING.  As she finishes telling me this, a police officer approaches us.  The officer in question is an almost nightly customer of ours, whom we know rather well.  As Angela explains the story to him, Liz walks up and essentially tells the officer to go away, and that nothing is wrong and she'd gotten it under control.  The cop sees the horrified looks on my and Angela's faces, and leaves.  Liz then allowed Angela and me to hide in the back until Lenny left the premises, but there was nothing I could do.  When I spoke with my boss

A little background to this story: We just got a new part timer in our department and even though she's been here about two weeks yesterday was the first time I've met her. She witnessed this whole thing go down and hopefully she doesn't think this happens often.

Yesterday at the shoe department it was pretty bonkers; tons of clearance going on so I had a lot of customers wanting shoes and I was by myself until 45 minutes before my shift ended. New girl, a teenage girl, I go talk to NG. Halfway through finally introducing myself we see this kid bolting down the front center aisle of the accessories department, yelling ""I didn't steal nothing!"" followed by our two LP officers charging after him at full speed. The kid was carrying a backpack full of Polo shirts and dropped it while he was running. After they turn the corner me and NG and another customer start chatting about what happened. A few seconds later a couple other kids (one carrying a Victoria's Secret bag--an important detail) cut through our department, heading toward the direction the other kid was running. I saw in my most threatening, authoritative voice, ""Are you with the kid who just ran by here?"" They denied it

A couple minutes later the teenage girl I was helping before the incident comes up to me and tells me that one of the two kids who walked by stole her Victoria's Secret bag! At this point I see them walk toward the front exit so I follow after them. 

Now as most of you fellow retailers know you just can't tackle someone on probable cause (or at all

Now, rent and utilities free.  Now, while it was a great idea in theory, in practice, it was its own special kind of hell.

We had this one customer, was a hoarder, and her son and the town forced her to take out some storage rooms to get some of the crap out of her house.  Lucky us, we got her.  She needed some help moving, mainly because her kids wanted nothing to do with her, so my ex (let's call him X) called these guys who specialized in rubbish removal, because he figured they'd be best best equipped to deal with the disaster her house was.  

When they arrived at the storage place, told us that they dumped the worst of the stuff while S wasn't looking, because it was too gross to be moved, and S freaked out whenever they threw anything away.  The other guys just kept shaking their heads and muttering about ""feces"" and ""bugs giving birth to other bugs.""  R didn't talk to X for a while after that.

S would come by the storage place to, but leave a nice big wet spot on the chair.  Good thing she could only drive about 5 mph, because we'd see her coming and quickly wrap the chairs in plastic wrap, telling her she had to sit on the plastic because we just had them cleaned.

One day she comes in and goes into the bathroom.  At first, she died in there.  I can't deal with that."" I'm thinking as I knock on the door.  ""You ok S?""  I call and almost fall over in relief when I get an answer of ""I'm not dead yet!"" through the door.  Thank whoever, she's alive.

The door cracks open.  ""Excuse me, what did you do?""  She tries to block me from seeing into the room, but she's only about 4 feet tall, so I easily see over her.

It's shit.  The room is covered in shit.  It's everywhere.  It's on the toilet.  It's on the sink.  It's on the floor.  It's on the walls.  It's on the...

She glares at me ""I'm sick.  Haven't you ever been sick?""

""Yeah

S just stands there and stares at me.  ""Aren't you going to clean it up?"" she demands.

 X comes in at this point (I forget where he was)

I groan

S then bends over to get her purse.  It's at this point I realize, and her son needed to step up.  X made sure he knew that.

I lost track of how much time I spent in the bathroom, full of shitty clothes and paper towels.  The bag was warm.  I'll never forget that.  The bag was warm.

1359501326.0,17ixnu,That's not how returns work. Not here or anywhere else. ,BAWWWWful,487,82,143,"Today I present you with a familiar retail tale, spineless manager bends policy to avoid confrontation. It makes you wonder why policies exist in the first place. This tale is not as gross or shocking as some of the other stories about returns


This occurred circa 2009 when I worked in the Men's department of [crappy department store]. Our store's return policy was more than fair if you ask me. Most merchandise, you could return merchandise in virtually any condition, there were very few limitations on this. If you had no receipt, we could return the item for store credit so long as the SKU came up in our system and the item wasn't visibly worn. We even accepted merchandise with no tags, as long as it was something we currently carried and therefore could obtain a SKU and process the return. Exchanges were allowed as long as the item was of equal value, preferably the same brand and style. You get the idea. Often when customers found out that they could only get store credit without a receipt, they would opt for an exchange. 


One day

*Foreshadowing: Michelle in particular is known for not taking shit from anyone

At that moment, we didn't even know whether he bought it from us to begin with. We directed Belt Guy to the corner of the department where the belts and wallets lived so that he could buy himself a new friend. 


Belt Guy returns about 10-15 minutes later carrying a brand new Fossil belt with tags. If memory servers


**Belt Guy**: I put the other belt on the rack and I exchanged it for this one


I'll pause the dialogue for a moment so we can all take that in. This customer thought it was totally normal to ~~exchange~~ take new merchandise without presenting his original merchandise


*(He starts towards the door.)*

**Me**: *(flabbergasted)* What?

**Lindsay**: Sir

**Belt Guy**: *(looking perplexed)* What?

**Lindsay**: We would have to actually process the exchange at the register

**Belt Guy**: But someone said I could!

*Lindsay and I exchange looks

**Me**: Who?

**Belt Guy**: It was a lady... she had brown hair.

Note: the description he gave seemed intentionally vague


It was pretty clear to us what was going on here. This guy knew he wasn't going to get his return through the proper channels because he had probably worn his old belt for years and knew we couldn't turn around and sell it to someone else.


Fortunately

**Belt Guy**: You! *(points at Michelle)* You said I could just leave the other belt on the rack and take this one!

**Michelle**: *WHAT?* No I didn't. 

**Belt Guy**: Yes you did! I want to talk to a manager!


You can imagine our joy^facetiousness upon hearing those awful words. At [crappy department store], understandably, continues arguing with the customer. I would be angry too, being accused of something that I know I didn't and would not ever do.


We quietly groan among ourselves when we see who we won playing the manager lottery. It's **Nancy**^still ^with ^the ^made-up ^names! . Nancy isn't your run-of-the-mill spineless manager. Oh no, she seemed like a nice enough lady and all, but why take on a position of authority if you're incapable of telling people what to do?


Nancy strolls up to the register, Lindsay and I chime in with bits of policy, particularly underlining the reasonable notion that when you exchange merchandise, you should ACTUALLY GIVE US THE MERCHANDISE. This back and forth goes on for a while, Nancy nervously glancing between the four of us, until she just can't take it anymore. She throws her arms up in consternation:


**Nancy**: Oh


And that was it. She walks away. The three of us are wearing our best *are you fucking kidding me?* faces


That's right. The fucker got away with it. I don't remember if that was the last straw, give the customers whatever they wanted, and deal with the repercussions. Spoiler alert: there never were any.

1376069042.0,1k1cgs,Stories From a Public Library,Above_an_F,481,77,58,"I don’t work in retail

**Background:** I am a female college student in my 20s and, I handle the computers, the teen room, and occasionally the textbook area.  Here are some of the incidents I have encountered in my short time here:


**IDENTITY THIEF**
This happened during my first month.  I was working the circulation desk (where people check out books) and an older gentleman comes up to me.  He says hello, and I find it in the system for him.  It is, unfortunately, already checked out so I offer to place it on hold for him. He agrees and I ask for his library card.  He lets me know that he actually is new to the area and doesn’t have one yet but would like to get one.  No problem.  I just need to see proof that he lives in the city limits.  He pulls out a bill that has his name and address and I tell him I just need to see some ID, preferably a license.  This is when he goes ape shit.  

He yells: “I KNEW IT! I KNEW THE GOVERNMENT WAS TRYING TO STEAL MY IDENTITY! YOU AINT GETTING MY BRAIN, and runs out the door. Never saw him again.


**PRINT
At this point I had moved to working at a different desk where I took care of people who needed to print things.  A Chinese man comes up to my desk and holds out his flash drive and says “Print, of course, none of the files are in English. I ask him which file, and show him the screen and he says: “Thank you. Print, please”.  Although more frustrated, I decided to continuing helping.  I opened up each file and each time he shook his head no until we reached the file he wanted.  Keep in mind, there were about 100 files on this flash drive.  Eventually, but when he saw his paper he beamed and said “Please print


**ITS OKAY
This story wasn’t that frustrating
The library has a teen room that they reserve only for teens.  Others can go in and grab any book they want, and couches in there are meant just for teens.  They have that rule because more teens are likely to come if they have their own spot.  Teens are anyone who is anyone between 12-20 years old. 

One day, he is a big, burly, black man that was at least 40 years old.  I let him know again that he can’t be there and that there are computers elsewhere.  

He smiles at me with what teeth he has left

Man: Looking me up and down “It’s alright sweet thang

Me: “Sir

Man: “I promise

At this point he is trying to get near me and touch me so I exit the room and go to my desk.  From my computer I shut down his account so he can’t use that computer.  He comes up to me, and that that computer must be broken but he could try another computer if he wanted.  

Man: “Bitch

And then he left the library.  


**THAT’S NOT WHAT I’M LOOKING FOR**
I was now working the information desk where I helped people find a book they were looking for.  A man comes in and mumbles a bit and asks me where the romance section was.  I point him in the direction

Mumbling man (MM): *indiscernible mumbling*

Me: “Sir

MM: “THAT’S NOT WHAT I’M LOOKING FOR.  THE SECTION WAS THE WRONG ONE. WHERE ARE YOUR GRAPHIC NOVELS”

Assuming he meant comics and such

About 5 minutes later he comes back

MM:  *indiscernible mumbling*

Me: “Sir

MM: “THAT’S NOT WHAT I’M LOOKING FOR. AHH! THAT WAS 
WRONG TOO! WHERE ARE YOUR MAGAZINES”

He was yelling loudly but it is my job to help him so I pointed him to the magazines.  At this point, and this time he is fuming.

MM: “THAT’S NOT WHAT I’M LOOKING FOR! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU

Me: “Sir

MM: “FINE. I’m looking for your exotic section”

Me: “Our…exotic section?”

MM: “Yes. Your pornography. Books

Me: “Sir

MM: “Oh. You sure?”
Me: “100% positive”

MM: “Oh. I guess that makes sense.  That’s alright. I'll just find something else to read”

He leaves and heads off into the Children's department. At this point the security guard follows him and eventually escorts him off the premises.

I used to work in a music store.  We sold all the usual good stuff. Guitars, DJ gear.... you get the picture. For the most part, we had pretty good customers.  A nice blend of kids getting their first instruments, home pickers, seasoned pros.  We even had a couple minor/former celebrity types that would come through on occasion.  We also had our fair share of douchebags.  Musicians, right?  We're a special breed.  

The one guy who sticks out most in my mind was a guy in his late 50's, and drove a loud firebird complete with the giant emblem painted across the entire hood of the car.  He was incredibly self important and would frequently butt into staff conversations with customers so he could give his very own opinions on whatever they were talking about.  And he loved to name drop.  I've never seen someone drop so many names in a single conversation!

So there we were one sunny afternoon and all was going well.  In comes Don who immediately makes a bee line for our one guy who seems to indulge/tolerate his usual hot air.  I'm at the counter as well restringing a guitar so I get to listen to our hero go on and on about his many conversations with Joe 90s Rockstar who is not only going to produce Don's new album

Restringing a guitar is pretty simple stuff, as regular a guy as can be, and stops into the shop from time to time for a bit of gear or some fresh sets of strings.  I greet him with the usual ""Hey Mr. 90's.  How's things?  That everything today? etc."" and start ringing his purchase through.  My colleague looks over with a grin and says ""Oh hey Joe.  Don here was just telling me you guys have a couple big projects coming up together""  
Well Don turns to spot Joe and gets this huge deer-in-headlights look in his eyes.  Joe just takes a look at him and says ""Buddy
Don's response is to stammer for a second or two while turning beet red before making a hasty exit.
Joe, then he heads out.  
I left that job shortly after so I never found out if Don ever came back or if there was any follow up to the incident.  Still... it felt really good to see a name dropper get called on his actions like that.

I work in Make-A-Monkey, etc. You get the idea. As usual, I will preface this by saying I LOVE my job. Love, love, love my job. Anyways, on to my lovely Valentine's Day. 

It was busy. The day before that, my ASM woke me up at around 10:30 and asked me to come in early. No biggie. In fact, that awesome. More hours and more money for me. 

When I got there, ""We don't need to spend scrupulous amounts of money on each other just to say 'I love you'."" 

So basically, work register, answer questions for guests, *and* help put away any of the new stock that was supposed to go on the floor. The problem had become worse when they realized that out of the remaining three people to come in, I was the only one who wasn't a new hire...somebody really screwed the schedule up.

I ended up getting put in the hole to unload the boxes and put them either on the floor or top stock. Which took a good 2hrs. The whole time I was in the backroom, and there was a steady crowd forming in front of register. 

I hopped on register for a few hours until we go to a slow point then made a stock list. I was about halfway done pulling everything when my manager(I think I called her Kate in another story) who had just took over floor after the ASM and GM left, Kate, for a second. We had to send one of the new girls home because she had stayed 30min past her shift and we had to leave the other one on the stuff machine because that's all she had been trained on so far. 

Kate and I made a game plan basically. She told me what we needed to get done before the end of the night, and the new girl all a to-do list. I felt bad for the new girl because she got all the shitty cleaning jobs but she was too inexperienced to know how to stock, reset the floor set, and box away the Vday stuff. Tonight was definitely not the night to teach her either. I got the lists handed out and then put the gate halfway down to discourage any more customers from coming in the store. It was starting to slow down around 8:45. The lines were going down, but it was 15 until close and we still hadn't even finished the midday stock, started a close stock list, or began to put out the new floor sets. 

7 minutes until close about 10 families ducked under the gate and started browsing. I let everyone know the store was closing in 7minutes and got complaints from everyone that

Like what the fuck? Okay

Anyways

Dad/grandad : Hey didya see this outfit? It's really cool.

Kid/grandkid: Yeah

dad/grandad: Well let's get it then.

Kid: I don't know

Dad: well you said it was cool so why not get it? Oh my God

Kid: Fine...I didn't even want to come here anyways.


So they're making their frustrating way to register and then mom/grandma suddenly remembers she must make three more stuffed animals for her daughters/grandaughters. But it can't just be any one stuffed animal. Oh no, of course, I was polite and asked if there were any colors or animals the girls were interested in.

She finally decides on our V-day themed animal. Fine. We make three of them. Then she needs three matching V-day themed outfits. Well our stock has dwindled and we only have a few things left. She doesn't like what we have left and proceeds to spend another 20 minutes looking. At this point

I tell the new girl to start on her checklist because it was just cleaning stuff that could be done whether a customer was in the store or not. She starts on that. They finally get up the counter and I start to ring them up. Of course

She has some coupons so I apply those and some point reward certificates. Now. These things basically count as cash. They're usually like $10 and they run as a tender. Like a $10 check from corporate to you. So once I run it through, what do you think she does? Oh well she decides she does in fact want that item I voided and not just one but like an odd number like 9 or something. Whatever. I tell her it'll have to be a seperate transaction. She doesn't flip her shit or anything but she's obviously pissed and not having any of it. Complaining and alike.

Finally, so I start on that.

Oh and the POS system pretty much crashed so Kate was on the phone with our DM for a while trying to sort that out. Then she had to send our V-day numbers and other promotional offer info to the RM and all that other manager-y stuff. The new girl kept cleaning and straightening...at a slow pace. At around 10:45 I started making a stock list(FINALLY!!) I made seperate lists and took them to the back so Kate could pull them. We got everything re-stocked decently. Not perfect but at this point we were way past caring. Sent the new girl home. Finished  the new girls cleaning list and finally clocked out at 11:30. I worked a 10.5 hour shift that day. Damn was I tired. 

I then proceeded to work an 8hr shift the day after V-day and a another 10.5hr shift yesterday. So in three days I racked up essentially 30hrs. 

The pros - my store manager is asking the DM for the go ahead to give me manager training

The cons - I lost my voice from talking to customers so much.

Immediately, this better not be going where I think it's going...*

She says, you need to make me a taco salad. I want one with a shell.""

I apologize and say

Her face turns red, that's what makes them taco salads! Without the shell, it's not a taco salad!""

In one last attempt to be polite, in fact, come with an edible shell, but a bowl. It looks exactly like the one I made for her. I show her that it's exactly how we advertize it.

She says

I get the manager and walk away because I'm fuming at her. Manager says something to her and makes her leave. Later, that a customer got a taco salad made ""incorrectly"" without an edible shell, and that we were rude and refused to make it ""correctly,"" which puts a negative mark on our store's score.

It was closing time at our store and I was working on checking out the last crowd of customers. All was well when I hear the word “manager” escape from the lady that my coworker is checking out. I mentally brace myself and finish up with my transaction then walk over to my very pregnant coworker and her transaction. In the five seconds it took me to walk over there

AoP: How can I help you?

Grouchypants: I am in a hurry and I need to return this coat. I will be fine if you put it back on my credit card or if you give me cash back. I need to pay a bill today before they close at 9!

AoP: (I glance at the receipt) As my cashier explained to you

GP: I want cash back.

AoP: (now studying the receipt more closely) Miss

GP: Can't you just put it back to my credit card?!

AoP: Miss, so I already know this lady has returned something in the past, probably worn, too.

GP: (shouting) I need to take care of my mother with Alzheimer's! Just give me the cash! It's just 37 dollars!

AoP (recognizing this isn't going anywhere) I can let you speak with my manager

GP: (Angrily) Just ask her over the walkie! I need to go!

AoP: Ma'am. It's ten minutes past 9. You said it yourself. Everything is closed including our store. This is an issue for which I want to speak to my manager in person, anyhow. Isn't that what you want?

We do EVERYTHING. Photography, sales (no commission, but it mattered), cash register, delivery (give portraits to customer who pick up), passports, customer service, booked appointments

Here are the events to one of the worst days working at this job:

It was a busy Saturday afternoon and it was only myself and my one coworker. We had only worked together a couple of months and I had been at the job maybe 6 months. I think one other girl was supposed to be there but ""called in sick"" - details are fuzzy on that one. If she did

It had been an extremely busy day with almost all back to back appointments. No lunch breaks for either of us.. I know it's the law, but yesterday. I let him know his appointment was yesterday. He is livid. He starts yelling and blaming us for booking the wrong day. I say I can try my best to fit him in..My 2pm doesn't seem to be showing up and can take him in right away. ""Who's going to be in the photos?"" I ask. ""My family."" ...Me: ""And they are... ?"". Next thing I know he's on his cell calling his wife and screaming at her for them not being at the studio. He tells her they have an appointment. Gee, I wonder where the confusion of the appointment came about. He's a lot more calm now as he is embarrassed by this. He tells me they can be here in an hour. I say, sorry we have a 3:00pm and are fully booked until closing. At this point my coworker has come out of her photo room to see what is going on. She pipes up in front of him ""No, take him in. That 3pm canceled"". I stare right into her eyes, ""are you sure?"" ""yes."" ""your positive?"" ""yes"". Me: ""Okay, I can take you and your family at 3pm"". Situation was resolved... pfft

3pm rolls around and his family walks in ready for their photos. Who walks in next? Of course you knew this was coming. My 3pm walks in! They are pleasant and start getting ready in the lobby type area. Okay, I don't think you saw this coming. In walks a very plump and loud lady with 3 adorable but rowdy TRIPLETS! Triplets I tell you. I am not joking when as soon as they walked in they separated in a full run to play, scream and circle me JUST like in a film.  I actually stood in awe for a moment at how weird it was that they would do that as brats do on the hollywood screen. Who was this lady? Why she was my 2pm who never showed up. I let her know her appointment was over an hour ago now, and she was ANGRY. In a booming voice she blames ME! ""I told them I would be late when booking! I told them! How am I supposed to do this with triplets!"". Utter hog-wash because although we were heavily booked, they would have at least booked her at 2:30, not 2pm! Standing before me I had 3 families demanding photos that very minute. Out of all the chaos this one young girl walks in and asks to pick up her photos. Simple, right? Wrong.. it takes like 1/2 hour to deliver photos. You have to make sure the order is correct, is there any way you could possibly come back tomorrow?"" I'm usually great with customer service, we only HAVE 2 camera rooms

Thanks for letting me rant Reddit &lt;3

TLDR: Listen to your gut and stand up for yourself in a proper manner.

EDIT: I meant that I would take in the original **3pm** and fit in the others when I could. &amp; I really wanted to tell them all to fuck off except for the **3pm** who were on time for their appointment and did nothing wrong. Sorry, that was the most sane thing to do. The 2pm was the least of my worries of the group.

1363152590.0,1a77t6,Tales From a Video Game Store {RATED R LANGUAGE},toxlab,443,47,54,"I lucked into a great job working for an independent video game retailer. This was back in the day when SNES and Genesis ruled the land

I worked at an old school coin-op arcade in high school

""Gene"" was a different breed of cat. He wasn't a gamer, we would make up xeroxed cheat sheets for the fatalities and sell them for a buck a piece. If we could buy a used game and resell it that day, he would let us pocket the difference. Plus cash advances, gas money, and weekly poker and Jack Daniels parties in the back room.

The thing that really separated him from every other retailer I've ever worked for was his business savvy. If you brought him regular business and were a decent human being

We had machines set up upfront to ""test"" used games. This was back in the dark ages when cartridge based systems roamed the land, and people would go into the restaurants with their friends, and tell Junior to go waste time with the vidya until mommy had her fill of gossip and came to collect their crotch-fruit.

Gene was not a babysitter, he spent most of his time in his office watching porn on a pirated connection. He hated kids. They didn't understand release dates, trade in values, or system compatability. Little Vern would want Street Fighter Five Extra Mega Super Edition (The one with Pikachu and naked Chun Li) because that's what Timmy said he had at home, and Mom and Dad wouldn't understand why we couldn't fulfill a simple request for the birthday boy. After all, an eight year old knows better than SOME GODDAMNED MORON WHO PLAYS VIDEO GAMES FOR A LIVING AND ARE YOU CALLIN' MY KID A LIAR?

Gene gave these customers what I called, Possibly while charging you a service charge. Go there. That's my version of it. Gene's version was more like, ""Hey, fucko. Collect your retarded offspring and get the fuck out of my store. Next time you leave them here, I offer them up to the creepy thirty year old with a paper route."" Hilarity would often ensue. When one clueless individual stated that he had a RIGHT to leave his children unsupervised in the store while he partook of frosty libations at the steakhouse, and then threatened Gene with physical violence, Gene calmly removed his 9 millimeter from under the counter, and said

It was a gamer's wet dream. Serious players come in? We got the hook up. You get top shelf gaming all day long. Rentals on street date, son. Find the perfect system from you, clue you in to the gaming franchises that will have you ballin' all night. Love Street Fighter II? Hell, beat my Vega and I'll give you a freebie off the rack. Come in with your three year old copy of Dragon's Lair for SNES (the rotten ringpiece of Super games), with no box or instructions, and insist it's worth sixty bucks because that's what you paid for it? I can't give that partial birth abortion of a game away for ten brand new. Why dont I trade your 75 Gremlin in for a brand new Corvette while I'm at it? No, I am the manager. Would you like to meet the owner? Okay. No problem. Let me tear him away from whatever vagina based programming he's watching and get him out here. Oh, despite no one on staff ever having laid eyes on you before. Wait. Is he? Yes

This story hales from early in my time at the station.  This was around the spring of 2007, the war was at an all-time crap-fest, and everyone in general was feeling an all-time slump.  People weren't happy with their lots in life.  Where once people would ask to ""fill 'er up,"" we were now getting small and odd denomination requests, as it was obvious people were scraping the bottoms of their change jars just to afford to get to work.  In short, things weren't that great.  As Dickens said, the worst of times.

I had not yet been trained to be a cashier, and the driver asked to fill his tank with premium.  NOT A CHEAP REQUEST.  At the time, premium was around $4.80/gal, and his truck had something like a 20 gallon tank that was just shy of empty.

But the alarming thing wasn't that the guy wanted to spend $95 on gas, he looked gaunt and thin, his cheeks sunken and sallow.  His movements were jerky and had a random aspect to them, like the neurons in his somatosensory cortex had all gone on strike and the scabs they had hired to replace them really didn't understand the muscle movement user interface (this should be a lesson, always hire union workers).

After he had told the attendant that he was going to pay inside and grabbed his slip, and this is where I realized that the crew at this station would be good to go when things got rough.  Through very sneaky use of the intercom, whispered instructions, body language, and general intuitiveness, all three of the attendants, the cashier, the GM, then blabbered semi-coherently about needing the bathroom.  The cashier pointed to the door near the back.

At this point the AM, he shouldn't be driving.  Could we figure out a way to hold the guy there long enough for the cops to show up?  The AM went into the back room to call it in, while I stood watch.

That last question, still dazed and confused, but now walked straight past the counter and headed outside.  I yelped into the backroom, ""I think he's going to try and drive off!"" as the AM was still talking with the dispatcher.  His tone became more urgent as he now described the fact that this guy was about to make off with $100 worth of gas.  Haste by the responding officers was promised.

But Lo!!  The gas station gods did smile upon us that day, but he could not get it to start.  The attendant came over and asked for the slip showing that he had paid, but the driver just looked at him like he was a talking ficus or something, and went back to trying to start the truck.  The attendant then called inside on the intercom to ask if the guy had paid, and get the conversation on the microphone.  Nope, no money had been received.

The truck finally started, as the rest of us waited with baited breath for the police to arrive.

With their usually alacrity, until one of the cops reached out for him, and, like Usain Bolt coming off the blocks during the 100-meter finals at the London 2012 Olympics, he was off like a shot.

A short foot chase ensued.  I'm sure that if this man had not ingested some sort of heavy narcotic, being fast means nothing when you don't have good balance or coordination, because he tripped and fell over himself about the time he got to the far end of the parking lot, followed quickly by flying tackles that would make any Heisman winner proud.

Cuffed and secured, no cash, no checks, no *nuthin'*.  So the officers charged him with theft and evasion, and got him in one of their cars.  They then searched his truck, finding several small baggies of an oddly-familiar white substance.  Well then, add possession of meth to the list (got to watch them do the test on the material, we high-fived our selves several times

He was again arrested, but not before AGAIN getting in a foot pursuit, this time along the shoulder of the interstate.  I would love to have seen the faces of passing motorists as they saw a naked guy with a large chunk of wood being chased by several cops up the shoulder of a freeway in the rain.

The Idiot decided to stack the till drawers so they were balanced on the edge of a bin which was full of customer's rubbish

I spent the next hour after closing digging through rubbish with my bare hands, The Idiot did help out a bit. This didn't stop me and the rest of our staff from giving him a hard time. The tills were eventually refilled and handed to The Idiot so he could waddle off and lock them in the safe in the office. I went home. 

The next day I got in for the 5:30am morning shift to discover my Assistant manager on the phone to our head office as the safe would not open. It turned out that in his frustration

Head office told us that they could send someone out to fix it

We made signs with ""CARD OR EXACT CHANGE ONLY - apologies for any inconvenience"" and put them in front of all the tills. We were also explaining the situation to everyone who came into the shop as they walked in. 

Everyone seemed to understand

So this oldish fella walks up to the till

His reaction was priceless. He exploded ""WHAT IF I WANT THE PENNY

I told him ""You haven't bought anything yet. At present we do not owe you a penny, you can forego the penny change, or you can come back later when we've retrieved our change drawers from the safe.""

I watched as the cogs and wheels in his head slowly whirred into place. He looked down at the DVDs in his hand and then back up at me.  ""I'm not happy about this"" he said as he handed over the £20 note. When he left he did go for a chat with the policeman

Addendum - Loose ends

The Idiot wasn't reprimanded too harshly for breaking the safe or dropping the till drawers

We received no overtime payment for the hour spent digging through the bins. 

I got an infection in the nail-bed of my finger about a day later. It was very painful and I blame having to dig through garbage for change.

The two officers with the lady were interviewing her, asking her what might be the reason that people were calling about her, her responding that she was just having a bad night, the officer who had been down at the McDonalds came up to talk to us two pump jockeys.

The two officers with her reacted instantly, and his big V-8-Interceptor-Packaged-Police-Charger roared up between the pumps.  The three officers had a hell of a time getting her into cuffs, because even though she was slight, she was feisty.

Eventually she was controlled with handcuffs and leg restraints, now lying in the back of a police cruiser, still screaming and trying to kick the window, was being taken to jail for booking and then almost immediately to a hospital for a psych eval.

She says 'I have a £20 voucher and I need something for my neice.' I say that thats fine and ask what sort of thing she is looking for

'I don't know, we are a large store housing many ranges to cater for as many people as possible, this means she has a LOT of options.

Well, we step to the far right and wait for our food. A woman and her husband step behind us to wait a minute or two after us.

In just minutes, grabbing popcorn, and also grabbing burgers off the heater area behind them as the grill crew makes them.

This apparently *will just not do* for the woman waiting behind us. She starts out slowly, saying things like ""COME ON"" or ""JESUS CHRIST"" every time a worker walks by the counter at which we're waiting.

We were totally okay with that and honestly, good on her for keeping tabs in the middle of this chaos!

The self entitled twat behind me gets more and more agressive and finally drops this bomb- ""I can't fucking BELIEVE this. I paid BEFORE ALL these FUCKING PEOPLE and you told me it would be only TEN FUCKING MINUTES.""  At that point I look at our receipt: 5:07. Look at my phone: 5:15. And this lady ordered *after* we did. She's freaking out and just admitted they told her the time

The grill cook brings out our order- two veggie burgers and two fries. I know it's our order because he called the number, actually tries to *reach over me and take one of our burgers off the fucking tray*. To make it even more absurd, there was an employee behind him *holding* another tray, on which was a hotdog, so I can only assume her order was LITERALLY a few seconds away.

At this point I'd had enough- I hipchecked the counter, "" These look *amazing* and THANK YOU for making them fresh, which is so hard to come by at a concession stand. And in only 8 MINUTES TOO, which is LESS TIME than what you SAID IT WOULD TAKE. Thank you SO MUCH and I hope *other customers* learn to tell time so they'll know how FAST and EFFICIENT you really are.""

On to my story. I work at a gas station. A nice one, that's enough of me defending my job. 

A woman comes in. She's thin and blonde. Late 20's to early 30's. She's wearing a tight track suit oufit. I imagine it was from Victoria's Secret. She's yacking loudly on her cell phone. She comes up to the register and tells me she wants $40 on pump 1. She wasn't really rude or anything

I go back to what I was doing. About 15-20 minutes later she comes back. I greet her. 

Her: You're not going to believe this! I left without pumping my gas! I was on the highway when I remembered. How crazy is that?

Me: Oh. Heh. That happens sometimes.

My Mind: If you weren't yacking on your cellphone 24/7 this wouldn't have happened.

Me: [I look at my screen] Um it appears that someone pumped your $40 worth of gas. They could have done it by mistake.

Her: Well put the $40 on there again then.

Me: I can't really do that. You're going to have give me another $40. 

Her: Just put another $40 on there!

Me: Well

Her: YOU OWE ME 40 BUCKS. IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT SOMEONE PUMPED MY GAS.

Me: You...drove off without it so...it kind of...is your fault.

Her: WHO'S THE MANAGER OF THIS PLACE? GET THEM.

There was no manager at the moment

SL: What's the problem?

Her: YOU OWE ME $40.

I explain the situation. The shift leader has a a major temper

Her: I AM NEVER COMING BACK HERE. YOU ARE TERRIBLE EMPLOYEES. YOU DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS. YOU'RE JUST GAS STATION WORKERS.

This made me angry. It's not a glamorous job

She ended up putting $20 on a pump and stormed off.

Haven't seen her since. Thank God.

I was 18 years old, with additional bonuses for certain items (like cellphones for example). Any large sale was always very exciting for us, but we never tried to sell a customer something he didn't need or want, since having it returned would have the same commission money coming out of our next paycheck.

One day I was helping a rather heavy set middle-aged man purchase a TV. It was a display, and got to play with the TV to make sure it worked properly and everything. He even bought two cellphones while he was there, one for him and one for his wife. He complimented me on my service and left happy.

Fast forward a week or two later and I see the same guy come into the store, I said I didn't honestly remember if it was doing that or not when it was in our store, but if he's unhappy with the way it's working, we could either:

* a) send it to our repair center to have it fixed

 or
* b) take it back and give him his money back

But either way, and he wanted to know what I was going to do for him.

I was completely dumbfounded. I repeated what I said earlier

Just when I thought that the situation couldn't get any more absurd, now.

The customer started yelling even louder, I said the first thing that popped into my mind: ""We can't return that, it's broken."" (We couldn't have taken it back no matter what, once it was activated he had to deal with the cellphone service provider and not us. But the situation was so absurd that I said it without thinking).

He picked up the mangled phone and threw it against the wall where it exploded into tiny pieces. Then he turned on his heel and stomped out of the store without another word.

I was still so shocked by the encounter that I had to go sit down in the back

A couple days later we got a call from the corporate headquarters saying they had a customer complaint about one of our associates stealing his phone. My manager said that we had his phone in a plastic bag here at the store and the customer was welcome to come pick it up whenever he wanted.

He never did.

Story of the Flying Vacuum!

I was roughly 5 months into my new job at Circuit City. They used to sell vacuums but not since I had been there. In walks a very pissed guy

Mini Hulk: ""This fucking thing does work!"" 

Me: ""Ok

Mini Hulk:  ""The fucking thing doesn't work!"" (he is almost angry that I asked another question) 

How so? (further angers him)

Mini Hulk ""IT DOESN'T SUCK SHIT UP!!!"" now my manager hears this and comes out of the office. 

Manager: ""Hi

Mini Hulk: ""THIS FUCKING VACUUM DOESN'T WORK!"" loud enough the whole store can hear this.

I take a step back and let my manager do the talking.... After a back and forth, doesn't know who bought it or when, we can't even determine that it was bought at Circuit City. 

Manager: ""Ok so what do you want us to do here? We can send it off to services and they can take a look but that will take a couple weeks....."" (right about this point

Mini Hulk: ""FUCK YOU GUYS YOU CAN KEEP THIS PIECE OF SHIT!!!!

He picks up the vacuum and tosses it over the counter like a javelin

Me and my manager stare at each other for a while trying to sort what just happened. The video replay of this is funny as hell, we get curious about our newly acquired vacuum. We are looking at the bottom, brush spins, still works. But he was right, it wasn't sucking. We pull it open (some of you know where this is going)......

The bag inside was solid and I mean like a paper brick worth of dust and shit. It weighed several pounds. *They had never changed the bag out of the vacuum...* I look dumbfounded at my manager and our warehouse guy as we all just laugh hysterically when it dawns on me

My co-worker had been looking through our search history and found a last name, etc, that purchased this model around the same time. Guess what the serial numbers match! I decide to make a call... well because we were being so smug. 

Phone: Hello?

Me Hi is this Mr. Hulk??

(Posted because people suggested it was worthy of more than a comment),toxicpretty,459,77,28,"I had a similar experience when I worked as a makeup consultant for a small chain of  boutique makeup stores. We worked in a mall and gave free ""mini makeovers"" for customers in order to get them interested in our products. I worked along side a more senior associate who had quite the attitude. She made it a point to only target people who looked liked they had money to burn...she'd leave the rest to me. I didn't care cause it was just fun making people look their best...I loved showing people how to create a beautiful look for themselves and I actually like most of our products so it was easy to recommend them. 

One day a couple of little girls came in to ask for makeovers. Because they looked about twelve, I could show them how to make it look natural and simple. Maybe even help them avoid the god awful self-taught looks that little girls usually do. 

So I sit the first one down and start to cleanse. Immediately I realize that despite being an exceptionally beautiful little girl

I thought that was the end of the story but I was wrong. A half hour goes by and suddenly a woman rushes in demanding to know who gave a makeover to her daughter. I immediately recognize the little girl with the cleft lip  trailing behind her. The senior consultant smiles and points to me...thinking I'm about to get a major chewing out. But instead I am immediately hugged. There are tears and laughs as the mother urgently explains that I'm a miracle worker and that her daughter has never looked so beautiful. She then goes on to tell me that her daughter is a steady pageant contestant who has racked up many a trophy despite the cleft lip ...but now she NEEDS me to teach her how to fix the scar. Fast forward...twenty hugs and a professional makeup consultation is scheduled. This is a 75 dollar service we offer for people wanting a full, and makeup application. I want to add at this point that I worked on a base pay/commission status...making a small bonus for each item I sell along with my hourly rate. The  professional consultation comes with a nice commission.

The senior consultant was shocked and then grumpy at this turn of events but wrote it off as lucky but unlikely to lead to any major sales due to the girls age.
Oh how wrong she was...
Three days later, her mom, and her dad. There is a weird feeling in the air...not bad, just weird. It doesn't take long to realize that the couple is divorced, civil, and madly in love with their daughter. But there is some tension and some emotional ""issues"". It seems that dad's paying and mom is consciously/unconsciously using that to drive up the purchases. She's treating me like a makeup guru and every time I even touch a product, it's purchased. It was like something out of a game show shopping spree...with the piles of makeup up and cleansers building a metropolis at the register. I'm having candid camera moments, IMO, they don't work anyway. By this time they had bought nearly one of everything in the store with the dad seemingly unfazed and the mom and girl giddy as can be. It was the most fun I'd had in the month I'd worked there (oh yeah...did I mention that?). And then it was over to the tune of nearly $600 not including the makeover. Plus many hugs

My senior consultant had unfortunately not been scheduled to witness the crazy spree but was there the next day when my manager came in on his day off to award me an additional bonus and certificate for best individual sale to date. I guess I had broken a previously held record by nearly a hundred dollars!
The look on the Sr.consultant was priceless...almost better than the hugs and money...almost

Bitch, maybe that's because you decided to seat yourself! I put on my best customer service smile and brought them some menus.

1359556524.0,17k8ms,Tales from a Former LP- Madea Goes Upside her Grandchildren's heads.,Drunken_Black_Belt,482,107,92,"Hello one and all! Recently I've been receiving a lot of messages asking for tales from my days as a security guard at the two amusement parks I worked at


It was a slow, in the summer time, I don't like AC. I'd rather drive with the windows, and sunroof open, enjoying the air.  So I tended to keep my windows and sunroof cracked open a bit when I parked for long periods.  This afternoon, mother nature decided to take a shit on me, and it rained, with a torrential downpour.  Naturally, leaving me with a slightly soaked car interior

So naturally, because my opportunity presented itself shortly after.  Being a slow day, I was following the few customers in the store, not really paying attention to them, if I'm being honest.  But when I switched to the camera that watched the video game aisles,  I noticed two young kids, with a stack of games in their hands.  They weren't too old, and from the way they were whispering to each other, are aware that most games in these stores have plastic security cases around them

Anyways, is usually a bargain rack or bin.  Cheap $10 and $20 games, usually pretty shitty.  But sometimes you can find some gems in there.  Well these boys had searched and found a few apparently. Each kid had about 3 or 4 games in his hand. I watched them move to a remote corner of the store, and begin to unwrap the games.  Hands shaking, they removed the plastic, and stashed it in a laptop bag.  They quickly peeked inside of the game case, verifying their treasure was indeed inside.  Once the first game was free from is cellophane prison, as a younger man

At this point

""Why brother, without much forethought, that we could stash the wrappings of our contraband in this here refrigeration box.  Then we can take this disk containing games of video back to our domicile and spend many an hour together rejoicing in our conquest!""

""Splendid!"" cried Boy 2 ""Let us at once good sir.""

Well at least that's how they sounded in my head.  For some reason, in the fridge. They did this not once, but 3 times.  Then they wandered off to the music section, and watched the appliance aisle.  My guess is they wanted to see how often people checked before actually removing the games from the cases.  And this is where things get interesting.

An older black woman walks up behind them.  She apparently scared the crap out of them, they followed, dutifully.  That is when the fuckery began on my part.  I had our appliance manager go to the three fridges containing games, and remove the disks from the cases, and leave the cases in the fridges.  She brought the disks over to me, and I smiled a devious smile, like a guy who is stuck in an crowded elevator with the boss he hates, yet silent fart of quiet revenge.

Eventually, and begin to go for their main target.  I wish I could accurately describe the look on their faces as they opened the Fridgidaire, reached in to open the game case, only to discover its empty.  A look of pure joy , slowly morphing into a look of utter complexity.  I imagine its like being handed your child after your wife gives birth, only to discover that it has both sets of genitalia on it.

The boys looked around in a panic, and I could rest easy knowing two little shits had been taken down a couple of pegs.  But NOPE. One of the boys quickly ran back to the game aisle, picked up two of the games their grandmother had made them put back, and returned to the chair.  He removed the two disks, and handed them to his brother, who quickly place them under the chair.  Then the first brother went and put the cases back into the game aisle. 

Naturally I raised the Theater supervisor on the radio, knowing a bit of fuckery himself, held down his radio so all could hear the conversation.

Supe: Hey guys

The boys shared a glance with each other

You never go full retard.  (Shout out to Robert Downy Jr.)

Supe: Hey guys cmon it'll take two seconds. I know they are comfy

Boy 1: Umm.. Our grandma told us to wait here. We aren't allowed to move.

Supe: I'll tell her I ok'd it.  Or stand here and we'll bring a couch over for you.

The two boys got up and STOOD THERE, and picked them up after putting the chair down.

Supe: Oh hey these weren't yours were they? Fell out of your pocket?  No? Sorry

The two boys acted suprised, was surely no place that they wanted to be, lest they tarnish their purity, and quickly left the area.  At this point, everyone on the radio is laughing, or trying not to laugh while dealing with customers.  My manager comes up and I tell him I'm gonna make sure they understand. He gives a nod and goes out and gets all the games and cases and brings them up to me.  Now the boys didn't remove anything from the store, so legally

After several more minutes, and ask her if she has a minute.  She says yes, and I pull her aside, with her two rapscallions in tow.  

Me: ""Ma'm are these your grandsons?""

Madea: Why yes they are. Is there a problem?

Me: Well

Madea: What? How dare you accuse them of stealing?  We just got back from church!  These are good boys!

Me: I'm sure they are.  And I don't normally say anything or act unless they have removed something from the store, so you can talk to them

After much hooting and hollering about how I'm racist, and the stare she gave her boys would make Hitler hug a Jew just to make it stop.  She turned to me, apologized profusely, and assured me she would take care of it.  At this point we were in my office, and she asks if she can have a moment alone with her grandsons.  I agreed and closed the door behind me.  The smacks were audible, even though she was screaming at them full force. A minute later the ruckus died, and they walked out, into the sweltering day.

Every Wednesday we sell fried fish in the prepared food section. Now our fish is really good and we sell a lot of it. Sorta famous around the old people community.

This belligerent angry blob of a human being walks in and stares at the empty section where the fish is normally kept.

He tells me to get that man out of the store and make sure he's gone before we leave the building. I tell the man that it must be a mistake  and he leaves. He did so very agreeably.

The lady goes through the same price discrimination spiel, the manager pulls out our store policy, which he had grabbed as soon as I had talked to him and quotes the relevant passages verbatim to her. Once again, as she drops Mary's name repeatedly and tells the manager that Mary had told her personally that she was allowed to be the one exception to the policy. My manager tells her in the most polite terms possible that this is clearly not true, so he tells her that he's not playing games with her anymore, she can't leave without a parting shot

As we wait for her to come up, *sir*."" I respond by telling her that she's disliked me for awhile now. She acts all offended, saying that she's never seen me before in her life. I remind her that she's called me an anal retentive scummy Nazi racist. She insists that I'm lying, and says that I have a terrible attitude (again). I tell her, with all the disdain I can inject into my voice, that I'm sorry she feels that way.

The manager comes up, I just talked to Mary this morning. She mentioned you specifically as an example of how we can't change our policy. Further, you can't insult me and my employees here. So, you have three choices here: you can sign up for the card, you can pay full price, or you can leave. End of discussion."" She walks off.

One in particular was an almost-calico with fins for miles that was one of my favorites.

1353212780.0,13dve0,Let me tell you *exactly* where you can put those keys,JacOfAllTrades,446,72,56,"**UPDATED**

I had to deny a promotion last month because I couldn't guarantee a specific date to be back by from my knee surgery, and our main difference is that I work really hard, and she chats with everybody. She's friendly enough, just kinda lazy. I congratulated her when she got the promotion, which is basically like being a demi-supervisor (effectively, she got keys to the door and register... that's about it).

She has now become a monster.

Because I know how to run all of the systems and do almost every job, just got back from knee surgery); or 3) are in no way my job, and the person's job that it is is present. And she doesn't ask, oh no, she *demands*. And, to be clear, she has absolutely no authority over me. None.

Let me set up a scenario for you: I was working on a floorset project

Me: If I have time after I finish my work

Her: No

Me: No.

Her: You know I can write you up!? Don't disrespect me!

Me: You can suggest a write up... and the GM wouldn't approve it

Her: Did you hear me!? I said go clean the break table or you're getting written up!

Me: No. It's not my job

Her: Are you trying to push me around!? That's it

Me: Go for it.

At that point she grabbed an armful of the stuff I had just set up and stormed off... super mature. About 30 minutes later she comes back

Her: That break table is still a mess! Get your ass in there and clean it!

Me: I told you no. Unless you are going to turn me into a puppet

Her: *screaming* Do it now!

Me: No...

Her: You're getting written up again!

Me: Go for it...

After that she came over to harass me one more time, the table was covered with boxes marked for upstock, which is 13' in the air. Remember when I said *knee surgery*... you expect me to climb a ladder with a box on my shoulder? Pft. So, for her sake, I took all the boxes off of the break table, and, in a very passive-aggressive maneuver

That was yesterday, she was the only person with keys available to ring me, and after being told they were Christmas gifts and handed a list of the skus, she proceeded to rip open every box and the tissue (I don't mean open normally, I mean shredded cardboard and paper), then jam it all (everything I bought was glass) into a single bag with no padding. Fuck that. I left it sitting right there, took my receipt, and got the exact same things I'd just purchased

If you're that intimidated because you got the promotion someone else had to pass on

**Update:** There was a meeting held with the DM, and the demi-manager (which I was supposed to attend, but other circumstances prevented it). The DM informed me that I didn't do anything against policy and to be ""more conscientious of how things might look in the future"". According to the manager that checked me, the demi-manager received a write up and was apparently left alone with the DM and GM for about ten minutes, which means there's a pretty good chance she was chewed out the whole time. As far as I know she still has keys, but even if she changes her behavior now, I'm willing to bet they take them away after the holidays.

On this day I was working on the cash registers. I'd been there for about three or four hours, begging is illegal, the police are called, you have to move on. They're not usually charged or anything, just forced to move away. This guy is fairly regular - I work and live in the somewhat seedy side of my city, and I'd seen him around before. He'd hold up a small cardboard sign and sit slumped on the cement in the cold. It was sad, but I'd never personally given him money.

So this day he walks into the supermarket. Not unusual, smokes in hand, when he pulls out of his big jacket bundles of coin. Anyone else on this thread knows what I mean - a small bag, or cardboard, rolled up with a certain amount of money inside. He pulls out about $70 worth of gold coins and asks for more cigarettes. 

At this point I was somewhat shocked, clicks it, and calls someone that he's on his way. He turns back to me, pays for it in more gold coins (For us Australian's, that's $1 and $2 coins) and leaves. I decided to follow him out - telling my supervisor I had to let the security guard know something.

I walk out the main doors, etc. and he walks out to ask the man to move on. The 'homeless' man does - walks straight into the car park, a few metres away, and gets into a fairly nice car, drives off. Utter disbelief.

'Twas a nice summer day,* and the breeze is *just right* so that everyone is wearing t-shirts, shorts, and a big smile.  I was having a good day at work that day, as I had been told to be outside pumping gas in the sun and the warm.  Customers were being polite and friendly.  The manager was in a good mood.  Everything was going smoothly.  I should have known.

In pulls a large van and trailer, Oregon (along with New Jersey) does not allow self-service gas.  Been that way since the '40s.  But many, many people don't know this.  So I finished up the customer I was with, and jogged over just in time to see the Ohio driver get out of his car and approach the pump to pump his own.

I approached him, and politely informed him that, as an out of state resident, he might be unfamiliar with Oregon laws regarding self service.  I'm also wearing a bright blue/white uniform combo with the company logo and my name in bright red.  It's pretty obvious that I'm a gas attendant employed there and I'm not about to be an ass to him.  However, his reaction was nearly instant, and extremely out of proportion to what I had just said.  He got a nearly-Exorcist-level snarl of rage on his face.

And then punched me.  In the nose.

Now, but the punch wasn't THAT hard.  Enough to make me take a couple steps back and say ""Owwwww!"" but not enough to drop me or make it hard to see.  I touched my nose.  Blood.  Wow.  I hadn't been punched in the face since I was in junior high.  And this *individual* (definitely not a man) had just suckered me for being polite and friendly.

Now, I reacted with the training I'd been taught.  Left foot forward, right hand grabbing their right wrist, left hand placed below their elbow, pivot clockwise on left foot while lowering right hand and raising left, place assailant's right hand in crook of left arm, grab assailant's right upper arm arm with left hand, standard law enforcement hammer lock.

But now what?  I look over at the nearest employee, bespectacled version of [Ned Beatty](http://www.topquarkia.com/Docs/Notebook/Ned_Beatty_cap.jpg) wrapped up like a Taco del Mar Supreme Burrito in front of me.  I didn't even have to say anything, he whipped out his cell phone and called 911.

Two units arrive rather quickly, just snarling at me.  I make a statement to the officers, and they go inside to review the security camera footage.  Local paramedics were called, since I was bleeding pretty good.  I refused to be taken to the hospital, though, since I didn't have insurance and an ambulance ride + ER visit = $$$$.  I went to the doctor the next day, who x-rayed my head and said I had several broken nasal bones.  This info was copied and given to the DA.

So Ohio guy got arrested and charged with Assault II, like someone had punched me in the face, and that wouldn't be good for business.  Ohio guy WAS from Ohio, apparently doing a massive road trip across the US, and due to lack of sleep (or some other lame excuse) came unglued at me.  He plead out to Assault IV (class A misdemeanor) and spent a week in jail.  I got three days of medical leave.

1360853952.0,18ila0,Tales from a Former LP:  Someone is stealing from the company?  Well long as we are getting our money....,Drunken_Black_Belt,472,108,140,"So as I've stated before, already over the company.  This set of events however

So most companies don't allow their employees to purchase or use gift cards.  It helps cut down on fraud and helps the LP keep track of the employee purchases.  Well, where not only could employees purchase gift cards, but could purchase them using their employee discount.  So a $100 gift card will cost the average associate $70.  Could be wrong but if I recall the employee discount was around 30%.

Anyways, who was an employee at a store about 30 minutes away, would come in frequently, and purchase $2000 of gift cards from each of the 4 stores, using her discount.  However no one seemed to ever recall her name, or when she was in.  So I never pursued it much.  However one day, I get a call from my Kid's store manager. She informs me that the girl has been in, employee number

In a 7 month period, that not a typo.  This part time employee, making not much more than $10,000-$15,000 a year, has spent the same amount in gift cards as a Senator spends on a high class hooker.  

Now, me and my boss didn't get along.  He was a nice enough guy, but he was Alpha Male as fuck to the point it just went from annoying confidence to full out douchebaggery.   ""Do you even lift, bro"" will more than likely be engraved on this man's tombstone.  Most of our issues stemmed from paperwork. For some reason, *D&amp;B* still used fax machines.... Fax machines.  But it would send the fax to the emails of the regional managers.  So why we couldn't have just scanned it and emailed it, is beyond me.  But once or twice a week, I'd send a fax over to my boss, it must be my fault. Whoa unto he who would dare suggest my that he was wrong about anything.

So I send off all the evidence, and any proof that she was actively defrauding the company for personal gain, and I'd have a nice big case on my record.  Right? Well obviously not, otherwise I wouldn't be telling you all this. Idiot.

So several weeks go by, another $6000 worth of gift cards, and off she goes, tra la la la la.
Dafuq?  So I send my boss a text, saying that he never received anything from me in the first place. After several messages back and forth that basically consisted of ""Yes I did"" and ""No, you didn't""  I took  a screen shot of the email that HE HIMSELF forwarded to me  from his boss saying the case was passed on to Corporate LP.  But nope, I must send it all again, *correctly this time* so he can get it going....  So at this point I'm angrier than Paula Deen when she doesn't get her hourly stick of butter fed to her.  But I send it again, making sure to CC the Regional Manager.  Who of course responds with ""We already have this thank you.""  Derps....

Anyways, go over the numbers, he quizzes some of the employees on LP knowledge. The usual stuff.  Then when we go to the food court to have a 1on1.  During the course of the talk, he brings up the gift card purchases.  Here is, to the best of my ability, an accurate account of that conversation:

BromanBossman (hereafter referred to as BB):  So we got word back from Corporate on this girl and the gift cards.

Me: Oh yea?

BB: Yea

Me: Oookay. Were they just not able to prove that she was reselling them?  

BB: The company just says to let it go.

Me: Ok but I want to just be aware if it was a problem on my end. If I screwed up I'd rather know about it.

BB: No

So I am scrambling to make sandwiches as fast as I can with a line out the door.  This was a week after we started toasting sandwiches, as I am making a sandwich for a guy, it slides of the toasting tray and gets all over the floor.  I apologize profusely and start his sandwich over.  When he finally pays, he pays with a $50 for a 6 inch sub and drops ALL of the change in the tip jar.  This happened several more times throughout the night(though no more $50s)  By the time the night was over, I had over $100 in the tip jar and I don't remember a single angry customer.

They are twirling around this post as fast as they can, yelling and screaming incomprehensible screeches at each other.

1357576351.0,164j62,The Manager from Hell,StevieDedalus,452,97,57,"Years ago, where the manager had been shot and killed in a robbery the year before.  

The new manager had dreams of being in the police force, though, and would drive me - his only employee - to reach for perfection.  Dollar counts at the end of the day had to be perfect, closing procedures had to be followed to the 'T'.  Any mistake was met with stern shouts and warnings.  At his suggestion, I spent many an hour working off the clock in order to make my hourly quota.  My numbers looked OK at this infrequently visited store, but only artificially so.

His deep and abiding affection for the police led him to do things like give away a free $30 antenna with each police-bought CB radio.  This was a ""managerfromhell's special."" In other words

This was not all, much higher.  One day, our dollar count was off by almost exactly 20 dollars.  Strange, why 20 dollars...I thought I had done well keeping track? After a while, the manager explained that he was a bit short, and lent himself 20.  So I was to simply add that 20, then 30, and deposited the rest...the till amount kept shrinking

You might think this is quite enough - unfortunately, he would cut open the shrink wrap, pull out the item and use it at home for a couple of weeks.  When he lost interest, he would bring the item back, and carefully tape the shrink wrap (if any) back in to place.  

It didn't take long for me to become really uncomfortable with these activities.  It was simply the wrongness of the entire situation that got to me.  When I would talk to him about it he would say, a guy who has worked for the company for several years, or you!?!""  I started looking for another job, and became somewhat depressed.

**His Undoing**

It is strange how I felt guilty in the end being the unwitting instrument of his destruction.  Each store could look into the inventory of other stores.  In this way, the salesperson would jump in their car and drive over to pick things up while the customer waited - in order to not lose a sale and that sweet commission.  In the end, a salesperson from the closest store called asking for a pair of walkie-talkies.  I looked in our inventory to confirm, and said ""yes, we have them,"" and we hung up. Then I looked on the shelf - oops, the boxes were empty.  I called the other store.  ""Sorry,"" I blurted out

The next day, knowing the game was up.  Within an hour, the DM and a loss prevention specialist I had never seen before were in the store.  They went back to the office while I watched the store.  Finally, managerfromhell emerged.  Choking back tears he said, ""just...don't do....what...I have done.""  And the house of cards finally collapsed.  They said they wouldn't press charges, if he would bring back everything he took home and repay any money he had out - but he was, obviously, he wouldn't have offered the deal.

I didn't last long after that.  I got a job as a computer guy in a data center and have never gone back to retail.  My sympathies though

Bossing like a pro

Big act just comes off stage

Staff are ready

All of a sudden I get approached by SmallLass. Really. She's tiny


Get the lowdown: Customer has insisted she's got the order wrong twice (not likely) and has started shouting at her. I send her to the back with a cigarette (I keep a pack on the bar for moments like this) and a free vodka and coke to calm down. 

Not on my watch. LOCK AND LOAD I'M GOING IN HOT MOTHERFUCKERS.

I go down to the person she points out. Enter DickFace the bitch (female). Notice her Pupils are doing a great impression of flying saucers

DF: ""You the manager?""

Moi: ""Hyup

DF: ""That stupid girl can't get our order right and tried to over charge us"".

Moi: ""Don't call my staff stupid

DF: ""I just want 4 Vodka and diet cokes

Moi: *pick up a vodka and coke and down it in one like a boss* ""yeah, and 5 Jagerbombs?""

DF: ""YES!"".

Put the game face on, I am Nick Cage.

Put them down in front of her

DF: ""I said 4 Jagerbombs and 5 double Vodka Cokes!"". - I see why SmallLass was upset now, this bar sucks!"".

Put on my best manager face. You know the one

Moi: ""No, either pay for these or go away. If you do not remember your order I am to assume you are too drunk to keep drinking."" I STRIKE YOU DOWN WITH LOGIC YOU HARRIDAN OF THE NIGHT.

At this moment DFs BF makes a cameo - ""C'mon DF

DF now makes a dick move: DRINK SMASH.

Fuck that shit. It's everywhere

ARGH

""Consider me fuckin' Willy fuckin' Wonka! This is my fucking chocolate factory! You got it? My factory!"" - Nice quote from the Devils Rejects that summed up my mood nicely.

As she struts off I notice something good

I head out back to grab my own smoke

I radio security channel 3. The one for the top guys

Simon the Lebanese Powerlifter comes over to get a more detailed description. I give him one. He points her out over the crowd

Now, by entering you give us this power (standard club procedure). Simon eventually searched her bag to find another 12 Ecstasy tablets, 3 joints, and a small bag of unidentified white powder.

Holy shit

She had all her gear confiscated as Police had a response time of 1 hour (classy northern towns on a Saturday). She was banned form the premises for life

I got the print out and gave it to SmallLass. Finally see a smile return to her face. 

Feels Good.

I sell cell phones and cell phone accessories. If you are signing a 2 year contract, everything that came with the phone, and, most importantly, the phone must be in “new and re sellable condition”. Easy enough, right? Well, not for one guy.

This guy comes in with a Galaxy S 3 that he purchased in a town hours away from my store. Which is kind of weird. Why not return it in the town where you probably actually live? He wanted to return it because he “wanted to wait for the new one.” Uh

Boss: Did he ask for me?

Me: No. Was he supposed to?

Boss: Yeah. He tried to return the phone at another store. The phone had been beat to hell. The District Manager even said not to take it back.

Me: Fuck. This is gonna be fun.

I head back out and inspect the phone. Sure enough

Me: Unfortunately I’m not going to be able to return this for you.

Customer: [blank stare] Why not?

Me: Because of the condition. It’s got scratches all over the back and there are chunks taken out of the metal part. (I then point at the damaged areas)

He then snatches the phone out of my hand like a child who’s about to cry

Customer: Naaaawww

Me: Yeah

Customer: Why? It’s before 14 days.

Me: It is before 14 days

Customer: Phones get dropped. I work in the [redacted] Service Center. I know that things drop.

Me: Why didn’t you get a case? That would have prevented the damage.

Customer: They didn’t have the one I wanted. It needed to have a kick stand on it. I had the screen protector on it. There’s no scratches on the screen so it’s ok. It's not all messed up.

Me: Regardless of that

He then picks up the tattered remnants of his receipt

I take the receipt from him

He scoffs. Scoffs like a rich white lady when told that she can’t park her BMW in a fire lane.

Me: If the phone came from the warehouse looking like this I would not sell it to a customer. *I* wouldn’t even want this phone. (That pissed him off. He started looking at me as if I just said, but just went a little too far.”)

Customer: That’s a shitty way of weaseling out of a return. (He actually said weaseling. That’s the first time in my life that I had ever heard anyone seriously use that term. I was expecting him to call me a jive turkey next.)

Me: It’s actually not. You hold responsibility for keeping the phone in good shape. Right?

Customer: Whatever. Let me talk to your manager.

Me: The one you were supposed to ask for? Sure. Hang on. (His expression turned from anger to slight shock.)

I grab the phone and go to the back office. I hand the phone to my boss. He inspects it and gives me a WTF look

Me: I know.

The boss calls the DM and tells him the scoop. He hangs up and sighs.

Boss: Go ahead and do the return.

Me: WHAT!?!?

Boss: Hahahhaha! Just kidding. Don’t do it. If he wants to escalade (yes

Me: That works for me.

I head back out to floor and tell the customer what the DM said. Have you ever seen any Hulk Hogan wrestling match? You know when Hulk starts getting beat down and the crowd is cheering for him? With every blow Hulk regains more and more strength until finally he Parkinsons out the pain, that’s what I thought the customer was going to do to me. I was about to get the big boot to the chest and then have a leg dropped across my neck. But instead of that I got a bunch of mumbled curses.

Me: You can call our DM if you want. He was the one that ultimately made the call on this after the other store denied your return.

Customer: Can you call him? 

Me: We.. . just… did. I told you what he said.

Customer: Gimme his number. (How about please?)
I wrote down the DM’s number as the customer packed his hamster trodden receipt and stair case ruined phone away. I hand him the card with the number on it, snatched it out of my hand.

We have these huge windows in the front of the store where we can see the parking lot. After the customer left, but I hand no time for gratitude. I had a job to do. I spun around and pulled my twin .45s from their holsters and rained lead death into the cab of the now bloody van.  His body exploded in blood and carnage as the van finally came to a stop near the blank media section of the store. I cautiously walked over the broken bodies of people who just “wanted to look around”. I approached the driver side door and found that the assailant was still alive. Barely, but still alive. He tried saying something but choked on his blood. He spit it out and hoarsely whispered, “Do my return.” I turned to the camera, took the cigar out of my mouth, and said, “All sales final.”

It was either that or he just drove away without incident.

It is a beautiful spring afternoon, ordering a skinny-- wait, I should probably anonymize drink names too. She orders a *svelte latte macchiato with extra extra caramel sauce.* (Please note that if you ever order a drink *svelte* and then ask for extra extra caramel sauce or, god help you, whipped cream, your barista is silently judging you.)

Shortly thereafter she arrives at the window. Her appearance is irrelevant, clutching a bank card in its ghastly talons. I swipe the bank card. The bank card is declined. Oh, dear.

As a show of good faith, my face and tone apologetic. I know it's embarrassing to have a card declined, and I feel bad whenever I have to tell someone. Usually, though, they don't just snap at me- ""You just have to ring it as **debit!**"" An exaggerated eyeroll, and she's back to the phone. Now, our registers don't have an option for debit (even though I doubt that would make a difference.) Every card that isn't a store card gets run through as credit. I inform her of this (once more integrating myself with her dialogue) and she expresses her disappointment in a calm, after which we share a good-natured chuckle and she drives off to her kid's soccer practice.

No, because clearly this is all my fault. I wait until she has to pause for breath, and then begin with, ""If you don't have another way to pay, I can-"" but I don't get a chance to finish that thought, because she interjects with a sharp ""*Just forget it!*"" and then pulls speedily away, I imagine

The funny thing is, because it makes for happy returning customers. She'd have gone on her way with a gratis drink, presumably to go ask her bank about her faulty card. As it is, she left angry and drinkless, and her *svelte* macchiato was given a dignified burial at sink.

Anyway, and he's so old and decrepit that he'd like me to push his wheelchair and help him collect his bags. No problem.

I wished him a nice holiday, and turned around to see the old man's older brother. He took my hand and put $5 in it, every single step of the way

I took the money without looking at it, the whole thing was honestly not a big deal at all, and said thanks, bye.

Bob is a little slow, no matter where he works there will be complaints. Generally he’s just asked to do “back-up” work. This way he doesn’t get in the way, and he can’t possibly mess anything up. But despite being off put, and weird, Bob has never done anything majorly wrong… until recently.

Eventually we’re asked to go home for the evening, and the police and managers help sort out the problem. There’s never any more than a few hundred dollars in any register, so the store couldn’t have been robbed. When going through the logs of the registers it is possible to see who was signed on, and what transactions they made.

It all started when a normal-as-normal-can-be couple walked into the animal room wanting a few goldfish for a tank they had recently set up. No, goldfish aren't a great choice for an aquarium, but they wanted some fish today, so some cheap feeder comets may end up getting spared from a piranha-induced death if they survive the new tank syndrome. As I'm catching their fish, they were admiring the saltwater tanks we had set up at the time. The guy asked if it was difficult to set up a saltwater tank, so I gave them my normal 5-minute monologue that I've titled ""How not to fuck up your first marine tank"" (I've kept numerous marine tanks before, plus I am a marine biology major

Afterward

Or so I thought.

An hour later, in a total panic. The conversation went something like this:

Me: ""Hi

C: ""I bought those goldfish from you earlier

Me: ""O...k..."" I then ran him through all the normal what'd-you-do-wrong questions

Me: ""Can you bring in a sample of water for me to test? That way I can see if there's anything in your water that shouldn't be there.""

C: ""Could salt hurt the fish?""

Me: ""At higher levels

C: ""Well on the way home

Me: ""Oh no....""

C: ""I dumped the *entire carton of salt into the tank*

Me: ""..............""

C: ""Hello?""

Me: "".............yes....that's why they're dying....""

We find her easily, then walk it around to up front, where she's parked. She then tried to explain to us how it was our job to carry it across the busy second floor and carry it down the escalator, across the pavilion, and then put it in her car.

Ok, to keep within limit.

So our story begins years ago, and the guy the client hired on to code. (Yes, I was a moron about pricing back then.) 

The Client, but eventually agreed to it. The project ended up taking three weeks of solid work to finish, but ended up turning out really nice. The site's monthly profit actually **went up by 650%** after the new design was launched. No, I'm not kidding, that's how much of an improvement I did. 

TJ, demanding extra free work done, and that we WILL do it because he's paying us so much. As I'm in the middle of trying to calm him down, and to explain that he got a VERY good deal on the project, he suddenly does a 180 personality change. He's suddenly extremely polite and nice, and says he completely understands. I'm a bit weirded out, but didn't think much of it. 

Well, calls me up, freaking out. His PayPal card was declined as he was trying to pay for his dinner that night. Considering we'd just gotten paid by TJ, to our Paypal accounts....this was odd. Both of us checked Paypal, and found out TJ had reversed the payments. 

Coder, and strips down all the files, and leaves up a note on the website of “TJ tried to scam his designer and the coder, and this is what he got”. Not a  classy move, but within two minutes, TJ was calling me up, screaming with rage. He made all sorts of insane rants, that we scammed him

I explain, the files will be removed, until receipt of the payment. He rants a bit more about how this is “illegal extortion”, but finally gives back the money. Coder puts back the files, problem solved.

Right. 

I guess coder felt like this wasn't good enough. I had no idea, and posted the entire story of how TJ had just attempted to screw us over. Being as one of the main hubs that EVERYONE visited, word got out. Fast. I heard about the post within half an hour, and by the time I went to go check, TJ and coder were having it out on the forums, screaming at each other. 

I promptly got a call from someone purporting to be TJ's lawyer (later found out it was his friend), etc. I tell Coder to cut it out, and I get the forum thread locked down.

TJ Ims me and throw a huge amount of threats my way....he's gonna track me down and beat me up, magically, this would all blow over.  

A few weeks later, and he asked if my kids were nearby, as they typically are. Hm, weird, but I said yeah, of course, one's even sitting in my lap. TJ is all “kids are wonderful like that. So, so I got up, hardcore porn floods the screen. I'm horrified, I had the feeling he was gonna be causing problems.

This occurred a few more times over the next few months. I'd get messages from fake people

The final straw came when he went onto that same forum that Coder posted about him on. TJ went  and made a post about me, I stole my client's bank account numbers, SSNs, and their CC numbers. 

I'd had it, and I'd drag him through courts if I had to. TJ flipped out, claimed this is all MY fault. I cut him off, say I'm serious, and I'm done. I'm blocking TJ again, and if I hear ONE WORD, I'm going to the police.

That was the last I heard of him for a while

I later ran into his ex-partner, he and TJ had sold the website after it became hugely popular, and the partner realized afterwards that something seemed a bit funny. He contacted the buyer, and asked to see the records TJ had sent them after the sale. He was shocked to discover TJ had falsified their financial records after the profits skyrocketed. He's siphoned off something like $10,000 of his partner's money, and kept it for himself.

That wasn't all though, someone withdrawing small amounts. (this website is where you earn money by doing small tasks)  He made an offhand comment on how that person must be doing very well, and the new owner was like “yeah, come to think of it....they're been withdrawing every day...”. New owner checks the account, and HOLY MACKEREL, they have a $5,000 pending balance! That's literally impossible to pull off....especially considering that the account was created **the day before the site sold**. Upon further digging, all created the day before the sale

And all with payment details that belong to TJ.

Yep,000, if he'd not been caught. So yeah, ex-partner and new owner were furious, and trying to find TJ. I just said I'm sorry, can't help you there, and went back about my business. 

Tthe next week, ranting about the same thing.

TJ.

He'd had a second business whose business model was paying people to run advertisements he was being paid for. But, and were in the process of setting up lawsuits.

Another year passes, and he suddenly blurts “Well, nothing tops this one guy, TJ.”

TJ apparently tried to scam a couple of people with the payment reversal trick. One of which was my new client. Neither would have any of it, and called the police in BOTH towns at about 2-3 am. 

He informed the police that the person he was calling about was waving about a shotgun

You can imagine the response that happened to that.

First guy was woken up at 3 am by the police bashing down his door and dragging him outside and laying him on the pavement. He was surrounded by about five cars

Second guy wasn't actually home, so they were woken up in the middle of the night by policemen bashing down the door and getting them out.

Everything got straightened out of course

The icing on the cake was that TJ contacted my client afterwards and ranted at him

New client then proceeded to show me some interesting links in an online arrest record.

In the year since I last told TJ that if he didn't cut it out

The first incident started out with him calling the police and claiming he'd been robbed of his TV and Xbox...only to have been found out that he was lying

Afterwards, and then domestic violence. 

His businesses all folded, from what I hear, they still managed to track him down.

However

Probably gonna be really difficult for him to do that

And it somehow may, with a list of all the arrests and his mugshots. To all of the major industry players. Maybe.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,

This story contains no snobbery, exploitation by a horrid boss, ridiculous store policies, or any of the other usual fair of my or the rest of TFR's stories.  It contains a single, earth-shattering Kaboom.

Like many other gas stations, not terribly hard but something that needs to be done correctly to keep from getting sprayed with liquid propane.  It was also one of the very few ways we could get commission, $0.25 per tank filled.  Doesn't sound like much, but during a nice weekend you could easily get $8-10 worth.

On this particular day, and it was nice to get outside and run around a bit.  A lady pulls up next to the propane refill, gets out her tank, and looks at us expectantly.  One of the other guys calls out to her that he'd be with her in just a sec, so I forget about it and continue with doing what I'm supposed to be doing, pouring dead dinosaurs into metal containers.  So I don't see my guy run over and start the process.  I can only assume he did things the way he's supposed to, because what transpires wasn't his fault.

The next thing I know, pretty sure everyone for a 1/2 mile radius jumped.  The sound was like a big-bore rifle going off right next to you.  I actually felt it in my stomach.  I whipped around to see a rapidly dissipating white cloud, and my co-worker and the customer laying on the ground.  Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh man, Oh God.  [Oh man Oh God.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9KyBdPeKHg)

I rushed over, with a trickle of blood coming out of his ear.  I gently place my hand on his chest and tell him to lay back down, don't move.  He can't hear me, but at least gets the idea and doesn't try to get back up.  I check on the lady customer, and she's in a similar state, unable to hear but seemingly fine from what I can see.  Regardless, I pull out my phone and call 911.  I told them we just had a propane tank rupture, I probably should have told them it was a 5-gallon tank

As it was, too.  The station is closed down, and the two who were next to the tank get the once over by medics.  Actually they got a twice over, but given what had just happened, and the minor miracle that neither of them had been struck by anything other than the ground, it made sense to check and re-check.  During this time the general manager, the assistant manager who lived near by and was off for the day, and wanted to make sure they were on scene in case legal stuff came up.

After the initial chaos died down to something more akin to Black Friday in the late evening, was the valve from the 5-gallon tank, along with a chunk about the size of a coaster from the tank itself.  Wow.  The investigator said that apparently the weld had failed, though how or why, he couldn't say right then.

However, pulled a Jimmy Hoffa, demonstrated it's ninja capabilities, been taken by the Lord in the propane tank rapture (The Rupture?).  It couldn't be found anywhere near by.  We were pretty certain that it hadn't disintegrated, because we would have found shrapnel and such.  It was just...gone.  Weird.

Both my co-worker and the customer were taken to the hospital for evaluation, albeit shaken up.  I've seen those little green backpacking propane tanks get ruptured by idiots with guns before, but never experienced a big tank going off.  That's a new one.

Fast forward about a week.  One of the other co-workers who was in attendance to this event lived near by, where did you find that?  Apparently when the top blew off, it had kicked the tank across our parking lot, over a street, through the parking lot of the McDonalds adjacent to us, over a fence, and into a drainage ditch about 75 yards away.  He'd found it when he was walking to work, and had gone after it.

I wish I'd had the wherewithal to take a picture of the hole, there were several dents that I assumed were from the tank banging into things as it made it's first and unsuccessful attempt at space travel.  We gave the tank to the GM, and I think she ended up taking it home as a souvenir.

Oh Hell no also smells and sweats profusely. Fluffy is just a happy go lucky guy.


Oh Hell No and Fluffy came in today and ask for a Manager. It's me and the newbie part-timer (Kareena) from the first 
story so


Oh Hell No clearly doesn't like me and goes to sit on our courtesy bench and leaves Fluffy to do the talking.


We have a shoe sale occurring where if you buy 2 you get the lesser valued shoe half priced. Fluffy and Oh Hell No bought 2 pairs of shoes during the sale but weren't given the sale price. Fluffy


I look at the receipts and instantly see the issue. They didn't purchase them on the same ticket. To get the sale price they have to be rung out on the same translation


Kareena rang them up and she confirms that they cued at the register singularly and she didn't know they were together.


In her defense there are 9 MASSIVE 5 foot tall banners advertising and explaining the sale that we're having. It isn't unreasonable for Kareena to have assumed they were aware of the sale and still only wanted 1 pair of shoes each since they didn't explicitly state they were together.


Fluffy understand when I explain what happened, friendly and not a douchebag plus, at the end of the day, he and his brother did buy 2 pairs of shoes during our buy 1 get one half sale.


I go to speak to my boss


Fluffy is pleased with the compromise


Oh Hell No who had been keeping out of it, demands to speak to my boss.



I'm going to be pissed as Hell if I get yelled at for going out of my way to help Fluffy out because His Incredible Stenchness doesn't think its good enough but



My Boss hasn't even made it 2 steps out of her office before Oh Hell No starts berating her about the Store Policy I had cited a few days ago when he wanted me to put his shoes on for him.


He doesn't like it and demands that it change


The more he yells


Fluffy looked embarrassed and about to step in but my Boss beat him to the punch.

My employees are not correctly trained to provide that level of care firstly and secondly"" ..... she pointed at the sweat that was literally dripping down in legs and collecting in his socks .....

My dad was on a business trip in a large city about an hour away from were my sister and I live. I had already planned to fly out to visit him and my step-mom as is, and we would fly out together in the morning. Now our flights were on different airliners, but we would have arrived only minutes apart from each other. They were morning flights, but nothing too early. To save money it was decided in advance that my sister would drop me off at the hotel, which would also give her a chance to spend time with him and for him to spend time with my niece/his granddaughter.

So I stayed the night at the hotel, he had some last minute things he had to do at the office.

At this point, and it's about 10:45 at this point..well after closing. As she starts knocking over shit, police try to handle her down but shes a problem to move...so what did we do...?

Handcuffed her to the flatbed. Rolled her fat ass outside and into the police car. It was one of the most frustrating nights that paid off so well at the end of it all.

As anyone who has worked in retail knows, however, it's a bad kind of quirky. This one customer we used to have was the bad kind of quirky.

This customer (not his real name, when doing a water test back then, it would take a couple of minutes. we didn't have those fancy colorimeters that use lasers to measure the chemicals. We were doing old-fashioned titration and using other reagents to measure everything. Normally it didn't take too long, but it definitely took longer after we had already cleaned everything up for the night. Not to mention, it can be a messy process, meaning we'd have to clean everything again before we close up.

He would come in, sorry, it just comes in 25 lb."" Mr. Rogers: ""Why??"" Me: "".....""), and tap impatiently waiting for everything, making me feel like I was defusing a bomb. Most of the time, we got him out either right as we were closing or a couple of minutes after, but seeing his car pull up at 4:55 was enough to turn an ok day into a full-on panic attack.

So, when who do I happen to see but Mr. Rogers. He was sitting a couple of rows ahead of me and didn't notice that I was there. His granddaughter apparently was on the Jr. High team, and he was there to see her. I debated whether or not to say anything to him, but I decided against it since I doubted he even remembered who I was. And then, completely by accident, I overheard him talking to one of his friends.

Mr. Rogers told his friend what he thought was ""the secret to getting good service"" at any place. He claimed that by coming in at the last minute,"" he said, ""why should they get rewarded if I don't get the best possible service?"" He even went so far as to use OUR BUSINESS as one of his many examples of places he knows ""for a fact"" that this technique works.

I thought about confronting him right then and there

The next day I went to my manager, shred his file, and tell him to pull his crap somewhere else. But I told her I had an idea of a way to get back at him a little bit, and she agreed.

The next time Mr. Rogers came into the store (of course, Alkalinity, Calcium, Free Chlorine, Total Chlorine, Copper, Iron, Total Dissolved Solids, my water is clear, we would be remiss if your perfect water turned green overnight!"" So

Finally, and he knew it. He looked at me and my manager and asked, ""why are you doing this? Why are you taking so long? And why are you talking to me about things I don't care about???"" My manager looked him in the eye, and with no hint of a smile or any sort of care in her voice, she said, ""We just want to give you the best possible service.""

It took a second, we decided the torture was over. We let him go after that. And while he did continue to come to our store (and get excellent service, I might add), he no longer came 5 minutes to closing.

It was one of the only times I've ever felt such sweet justice in my retail career! I will always treasure that moment.

TL;DR: Guy comes in 5 minutes before closing to get better service. So,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,t3_1huznz

When I was 23 I was working as a barista

Anyhoo
Being a night-owl I worked the graveyard shift. At the time my girlfriend and I had been together for about 8 years in a toxic relationship. 

Working a graveyard shift I met alot of different people, and people who just went out and wanted somewhere cool to hang out. I became the smart-ass frappucinno slinger who would goof around, and go outside and have a cigarette with the customers and generally do what I could to make them have a good experience.

So after working there for about a year I had formed strong bonds with quite a few customers. One in particular. She was a sarcastic

A couple of months later the idiot girlfriend and I got married
That ended about 3 months later due to us just starting to hate each other. I honestly have no idea why we decided to get married, it didn't. 

So after i decided that I was done with it all

10 years later I am proud and honored to still be with her

Hello TFR! I have lurked for a while and have decided to post my first story. DISCLAIMER: The location in this story is not ""retail"" per se. It is my local County Fair. However, but due to lack of a TalesFromJuniorLivestock, I shall post here. More info to follow.

A bit of context: I am a Junior Livestock Exhibitor/Officer of the age of 14. This means that I raise an animal to sell at the local county fair. But before the auction, called ""market week,"" we have to be in the barn for specified shifts that we don't choose(Hey, another Retail similarity) to take care of the animals and to *sigh* interact with the public. Usually this means answering a few questions about ourselves and/or our animals, and we get the semi-frequent question that should really be asked at Information. And then we get the occasional asswipe, like this lady.

Here's the story: I just finished the feeding portion of my duties
**A**: Asswipe **M**: Me **AS**: Asswipe's Son

A: Excuse me
M: Sure
A: My son wants a pig
M: They are
A: Oh
AS: I want THIS ONE! THIS ONE! *Points furiously at my pig.*   
M: Well
A: Good
AS: Is that my pig now?   
A: Yep. Go ahead and get in the pen and pet it. (Read: violate EVERY FUCKING SIGN in the barn as well as put your life at risk and worry me immensely.)   
So AS gets into the pen and starts feeding MY pig some piece of crap burrito and then starts hitting it to make it sit up. At this point I'm just thinking ""Oh HELL no. NOT HAPPENING."" Well my pig has finally decided to get pissed off and is attacking the kid. I have to physically pick the kid up and put him outside the pen. All the while
A: YOU ASSAULTED MY SON! I AM GOING TO HAVE YOU ARRESTED!   
M: Ma'am
A: Fine
M(Clearly past the point of no return): Ma'am
A: WELL DO IT THEN! I'LL TELL THEM HOW YOU ASSAULTED ME AND MY SON AND ARE NOT LETTING ME TAKE *MY* PIG HOME!    
By this time, the barn crew, and that her son has violated state law by getting into the pen and touching my pig. Lady tries to sell her story of me assaulting her and security won't have it. As they are walking out I utter a gem brought to me by this subreddit: ""Thank you, come again!"" When she retorts ""I'll never be back HERE,"" I respond with another gem: ""Please make that a promise."" I kept the $200 she threw at me. Got a nice new iPod. 

And that's my story. Perhaps(If the mods will kindly allow it) I shall do a few more, and the next fair is in June.(Yay...) So I'll have more tales in a short amount of time. If you have a better subreddit, please do tell me.

**Panic Dad!!**

I was working during Christmas season at the busiest store in the district, a parent called, and I could hear the panic in his voice.  He obviously had a list that he had neglected, and he was going to be in trouble if he couldn't find everything.  He listed off about twelve different items, and we had 11 of them- and the one we were missing was across the street.  I told him that if he gave us two hours, I could go get the item from the other store and we'd have it ready for him.  This was going to be a $800 sale, so I was willing to do a little extra.  I went to the other store, rang everything up and suspended the transaction for later, exchanged pleasantries

**There's a car on top of yours**

Same store, but it started raining, so we were slowing down.  All of a sudden, we heard multiple loud crashes outside.  A few customers ran to the door to see what happened- a car had sped through the wet parking lot, hit a median and flipped onto two other cars.  I could see that one was a VW Beetle, and I knew the person who drove it- they worked next door.  I was thankful that it wasn't my car, until one of our regular customers said- ""Hey theycallmejeremy, right?""... yep, and the kid who was driving actually asked me if we had any Call of Duty 3 in stock...

OK

**Hell yes

At this store, especially when items for the XBox 360 and PS3 started at 54.99 used.  A customer came in, and bought a bunch of used games for his Playstation 2.  This conversation took place.

Me- ""Your total is $192.20.  Do you have one of our discount cards?""

Customer- ""No thanks.""

Me- ""It'll actually be free today

Customer- ""I said no thanks!""

As I'm ringing him up, and is told what his total before and after was.

Customer- ""Why does he get his stuff on sale and not me?""

Me- ""He has our discount card

Customer- ""I SAID I DON'T WANT THE FUCKING CARD

I ended up just adding a card to his purchase

**MY DAD'S A COP!!!**

We sold both new and used games

Anyways, and explained our return policy.  He wasn't happy, and complained about how bad the game was.  I told him what the trade in value was, and said that was the best we could do.  He starts screaming- ""You stole my money!  Refund this now- My dad's a cop!""  I started laughing.  After knocking down some of our displays, he left the store.  Two hours later, he comes back with his dad, who is indeed a city police officer, and asks- 

Cop- ""Did you steal sixty dollars from my kid?""

Me- ""No sir

Cop- ""He told me he came in and tried trading in a game we bought for him Wednesday

At this point, and when he saw his son knocking over displays and walking out of the store with the game in his hand, his dad just hung his head and sighed.  Nothing like video proof that your kid is a world-class brat, huh?

**Slap heard across the world**

The last story I'll go with today is the one I tell people the most.

I was behind the counter after the XBox 360 came out, they were already paid for and just awaiting pickup.  I had just rung up a customer that prepaid, and brought his out from the back.  A guy that was about 5'10'' and 150 lbs (I'm 6'3'' and 300 lbs) walked up to me after I gave the first customer his system, and started going off.

Crazy-""I called yesterday and y'all said you was sold out of 360s!""

Me-""We are sold out- we just have those that were preordered.  We should have more by the end of January.""

Crazy- ""Oh hell no!  If you have it

Note that both me and the customer were white

Me-""Sir

Crazy-""Naw

He starts walking towards the back like he's going to barge into our storeroom and grab one.  My employee at the end of the cash wrap starts to put her hands up, I start walking over and put my hand on his shoulder, and ask him to leave.  He wheels around and gives me a full-on slap in the face.  I look at our store manager, whose chin just hit the floor, and toss my store keys to him- I was pretty sure I was about to get fired.  I told him to call the police, and I grab the guy in a headlock and take him down to the ground until the cops get there.  A few minutes later, his wife and teenaged son come in from their shopping somewhere else, and the son jumps on my back- like I said,,1372110388.0

We had a deli/coffee counter that opened until 6pm

The firemen and police in attendance sent someone round to inquire if they could get sandwiches and coffees made up, I made about 40 sandwiches  out of the days bread I hadn't quite got round to disposing of - still fresh, same day produce, but generally just chucked out. Threw in a few dozen coffees too. No homeless shelters or anything similar to donate to, and put the prices through as store use (free) after leaving my boss a voicemail. So even though we had no deli workers and we had closed the deli, so I jumped on and spent over an hour sorting them all out. I'd not worked the deli in over a year at that point but it's nothing too difficult.

Anyways, he'd had a visit from the local fire chief thanking our store and myself, and they'd left me a 12 pack of beer and an offer of a ride in a fire engine to say thank you for helping them out (Hell, who cares if I was 20. I went for it!).

And secondly I would like to dedicate this story to u/encore_une_fois as the biggest “thank you for the gold” I am able to give. I want you to remember

Thirdly: I realize that there were slightly more votes for the anthropological report on Powder Puffs

**So here it goes: Christina and The Steak**

On my very first barshift, and I was to be on the lookout for them.  “But how will I know what they look like” was my, in my opinion, pretty dignified question. My shift manager merely laughed, “You’ll know” he said and went back to doing whatever it is shift managers do. I didn’t give it much more thought; I figured if they were violent I could just kick them out, simple right? Wrong!

A month or so would pass before I got to meet these two delightful characters. No delightful is not the word I’m looking for, colourful. Christina was in an orange top, quite deep in the, eh, neck region. And blue pants that made her ass look about as wide as a barn. The steak wore a navy blue shirt with a fire breathing dragon curled around his sizeable beergut. Yes colourful is most certainly the word. They were both in their mid-forties and had that kind of look like life has been a bit rough. You know, the sagging cheeks, the eyes that never stay focused on one thing but seem to skid across the room constantly scanning for danger or opportunity

My shift manager was right. I knew. The moment I saw them walk through the door. I knew. How did I know? Mainly because of him. The Steak was, there could be no doubt. He was big and tough and meaty, he even looked like he was a bit “under-cooked” if you catch my drift. He was the embodiment of a steak. If a steak and a human mated, this would be the result, of that I had no doubt.

Christina was cheery, she perused the drinks menu. Unsatisfied with the general selection she asked if I would make her something sweet. And then she winked. I thought I’d imagined it, or that it was involuntary, but I now know, it was most definitely voluntary and I most certainly did not imagine it. However I chose to ignore it, misjudgment on my part I’m sorry to say. I made some drink, I can’t even remember which

She praised the drink, darling”. I went through the motions: Glass, Ice, “Which Gin would you like?” (Sneak a peek at him, loose wrists, styled hair, skintight clothes, darling”, Knife, “There you are. That’ll be 50 if you’d be so kind”

Short break: Read the above paragraph again, we won’t judge you, much. It just adds so much more flesh to the character right? Okay, back to the bar.

Once done with **G’n’T, wiped down the bar and then did the patient bartender spiel. (Your bartender does this too. It’s an act you put on, you stand around doing your best to not look bored when there are no customers, but in your mind you are either rehearsing the lyrics to “We Didn’t Start the Fire”, trying to remember what you had for breakfast or, if you are a dutiful employee, practicing different drinks in your head.)

 So there I was, Red China, Johnny Ray, South Pacific, Walter Winchell, Joe DiMa “This drink is reeeeeally good”. Her screeching voice cut me of halfway through the first verse. I look over and see her greedily suck the last drops through the straw. It makes that sound that you can in no way reproduce in writing, yet we all know it well. The sound of air and liquid being drawn through a slim tube on to a waiting tongue. The sound of slurpees and kids birthdays. The sound of movie theatres and unrelenting anger.

She pulls out the straw and licks the last drops off of it. Her much-to-red lipstick is smeared on her teeth. She pushes her glass across the bar and asks “will you make me something like this, The Steak did too. He shoots me this look, I’ve never seen it’s like. It was a sigh mixed with anger and regret, and just a touch of resignation. All this in one look. I was a bit blown away honestly, but I collected myself and made some random drink. Sweet with a bite, just like she asked.

Again she praised the drink, but how does a drink taste sexy? I asked if there was anything on the menu she thought looked good, she shook her head, “no they look so simple and boring, I like what you do better” Wink. You know what lady? Screw you and your sexy drinks, and screw your wink to!

I made her the simplest drink I could think of. A screwdriver! Glass, Vodka, Orange juice, (and then the twist, I added another ingredient, it colours so violently so I only used a drop, there was no way she could taste it) Blue Curacao, stir, this Christina

She went nuts! Bonkers! Mad! Completely frigging deranged! Over a drink, but no matter for this is where the story takes a slight turn.

The Steak, he just got to his feet, drained his beer bottle, leaned slightly over the bar and **CRASH!** He brought the bottle  down, holding it by the neck, on the edge of the bartop and it smashed, leaving him a nice little stab weapon.

Still not saying a word, looked at his wife, lifted the bottle neck with the jagged edges glinting in the dim lights, he grunted at me in a manner I can only assume was to convey “you get what I’m hinting at?”. I nodded, just at short curt nod of acquiescence. That was enough, he sat back down, pushed the bottle neck across the bar to me and motioned for another beer. I was not happy with the situation, or so I thought. I was wrong.

In my mind I quickly calculated how long till closing, no need to make any more out of the situation right? Again, I was wrong. This must go down in history as The Night Neomety was Wrong. The steak and I had made a silent agreement, none more would come of this, we had marked up the borders of our respective countries. Mine was Barghanistan, his Guestran. We shared a border but I would not invade his capitol, Christran, I can’t come up with a good pun on Tehran and Christina

Historians and people with a bit of knowledge of World War II will see the danger ahead, that’s for sure, and the same happened here. There was a Yoko Ono among us, a nagging little bitch who would not give peace a chance. A lipstick smeared teethed, orange shirted, blue pantsed, ass as wide as the Rio Grande little devil who decided this was her time to shine.

My boss was the franchise owner and a complete control freak. You know the kind; they'll do in 4 hours what you could do in 1 simply because they don't trust you to read the instructions right side-up. That was my boss. She was... a real treasure.

We always butted heads, nor was traffic.

She let me go, what I would do.

I arrived 2 hours late for my shift. My 5 hour shift had become a 3 hour shift, Ted Bundy and Russell Brand. She brought me in back and told me in simple language that made me pretty grateful;

""Shape up

""If that's going to be your attitude

Changing the size is not an easy quick thing, especially when you're trying to make use of specific panel and worksurface sizes.

One day she comes into my office and I think its because she's ready to finalize the project... she sits down and tells me that they accidentally spent too much of their budget on this specialty carpeting for the new office and that ate up most of her furniture budget. So the new plan is she found some cubicles on ebay and she's just going to buy those  and have me reconfigure them to fit the space.

New definition of Evil.  ,Set_the_Mighty,411,78,62,"So when I first started fixing lawn and garden equipment and vacuums for this company the diagnostic fee was $29.99 and the labor rates varied between product types.  After a bunch of years they changed to labor to $40 and instituted a flat labor rate of $64.99 but also instituted some tune up specials for mowers.  

Today they hit us with the news that the diagnostic fee will be $45 and the labor rate will be (wait for it...)  $110.  Holy fucking fucksticks.  Most of the product I work on cost *less* than $110 when it was new.  

Most customers are asked to pre-approve $110 (it was $80 prior to the $64.99 flat rate) because that leaves a good margin for parts costs and allowed us to fix product that had been pre-approved with out having to call and ask for approval.  

The company is out of its mind if it thinks customers are going to fork over $110 in labor costs.  Most customers are crazy to even fork over $45 just for a diagnosis which takes me all of 10 minutes on average.  Combine this with lack of reading comprehension on part of our customers and store employees and we will see customers sending product in only to decline the repair after I call em with an astronomically high repair cost.  The company will bleed even more customers.  

In case you think this is just an innocent increase in the cost of business

Net result:  about 1k of my coworkers and I (nation wide) lose their jobs.

New company takes over the work load with an understanding that productivity and costs will be X but finds that they were lied to in the first place and now this change will reduce their productivity even more.

My company then fines its new repair company for breaching the contract and simultaneously forces customers to buy new product because it set the cost of fixing old product so high that it isn't worth doing.

He then starts screaming at us to take it all apart, telling us that we are just wage monkeys (he actually said that haha).

My manager is pissed at this point and just wants him out. So he tells me to rip it apart and shoves it back in the box.

She whined and complained the entire time about how she didn't have the money for these things and only wanted to buy what was absolutely necessary, then almost threw a fit when her total was 5 cents more than what I had calculated for her. Now, when she comes to the store, she does nothing but complain about how bad those gerbils smell (i.e. she's not cleaning their cage). This lady was a few fries short of a Happy Meal, fast forward to today.

GL comes in again, I followed her around for about 30 minutes, thoroughly explaining that g-pigs CANNOT live in a small, enclosed, glass box, and showed her all of the larger wire cages that would be perfect for a g-pig. She decided we were too expensive, so she left for another store. I found my manager at this point and explained to him exactly why I would not sell another animal to this woman

Now, but thrive. But when it comes to people like this lady that don't have a bloody clue how to care for an animal, and downright refuses to listen to any advice I give, I'll straight up refuse to sell them anything.

Later on, I tell her there's no way I'm going to subject a guinea pig to a life, however short it will be, in a tiny glass box that it won't even be able to turn around in. At this point, she flips out.

GL: So you're saying you won't sell me the guinea pig?

Me: I'm saying that there's no way a guinea pig will survive in a tank that small.

GL: Well I've kept 3 guinea pigs before

Me: I've worked here for 7 years

GL: So you won't sell me the guinea pig then. I want to see a manager.

So I go and get my manager, my manager came back to talk to me.

Me: I don't know what she said to you to make you sell that pig to her, when she comes back to complain about that pig dying, I'm going to say ""I told you so"" and point her your way. I've said all I'm going to say about it.

So needless to say, but because my manager KNEW exactly what he was doing, and even agreed with me that we wouldn't sell the pig to her, and then he did it anyway.

I guess making a few extra $$ is more important than making sure an animal is sent to a decent home.

My boss hired a guy we'll call Mike four months ago. He was always kind of weird, maybe once a week. Every time I asked him about it, he'd just shrug and say ""It's not big deal"".

Two weeks ago

The next day

Tried to sell burnt-black breadsticks. ""It's not a big deal"".

This past week has been hell on everyone at the gas station. One of the girls tore her ACL and will be off for a month, and two of the first shifters were going on vacation. Boss was sick of Mike's bullshit and tried to fire him on Monday. He apparently started crying, and begged for his job. He said he was ""in a bad groove"" and that he can do better. The boss said he had until Friday to prove that he still wanted his job and that he'd have to come in when she called him since we were so short handed.

He came in on time Monday and worked a double. We were all optimistic that he'd been serious about changing. But then...

Tues: calls in five minutes before his shift

Wed: fifteen minutes late; no call. Asks coworker to work Thurs for him

Thurs: calls in two hours before shift

Fri: ankle hurts too much to come in. Pictures surface on facebook of him taking his girlfriend to dinner Thursday night.

Sat: Comes in on time limping hard. Limp goes away when he thinks assistant manager is gone

Sun: Five minutes after his shift starts

From 3-7pm I was completely alone in the gas station until a replacement came in. 4-5pm is one of the busiest times on Sundays. I had to make 5 pizzas in half an hour while ringing up costumers. And he had the GALL to show up around close to buy lottery tickets. Wtf.

Unfortunately


Don't get me wrong


---
She was in her thirties, high-volume) coffee shop had from Day One. Constantly. She had ideas of how to fix our problems before she knew what our problems were.


---
She talked non-stop


She was not from the Midwest


Whenever I expressed a boundary (""I'm really sorry, really, what would you do? Take away the internet?"") or spent the next half hour trying to psychoanalyze *why* I had that boundary, like so:


She once told a story that involved descriptions of being spanked as a child; my family has a long history of abuse and I was uncomfortable with the topic. So, either, I just flat-out told her ""I'm actually really uncomforable with this topic. Can we please talk about something else?"" She spent the next half hour telling me it was okay if I wanted to talk to her! She was a great listener! Why was I uncomfortable with spanking? She didn't think spanking a bad thing! (Maybe not for you. For my family, it was. Leave it the fuck alone. I thought you said you were a good listener.) Why didn't I want to talk about it? Her last manager told her she had a great big heart and was a natural leader! I should feel free to talk to her about anything! 


Kill me.


---
That was another thing. This co-worker's self-image was one of a good listener, quick interactions at the last place she worked. But it was so out of place where we worked it wasn't even funny. She made customers uncomfortable by getting too personal, too fast. (Her husband's porn addiction. Her father's dying words. Her Pagan religious beliefs. The untimely deaths in a car crash of a friend's children.) She didn't listen when it was hinted, suggested, or said flat-out that she was making people uncomfortable. She was everyone's best friend. Immediately. So she was no one's best friend.


---
The final straw for me, was when two different incidents happened on the same day.


Incident one: 


We have been working together for eight months, duty sheets we check off. She was busy with a customer, so I asked if she wanted me to initial the food she'd just finished and put it in the display case. She said it would be great. So, I initial ""WTF"" (initials changed for anonymity) and put the food up. 


She finishes with the customer, tee, eff."" 


""I know


She recoiled. ""How do you know that?!""


""Um


""Wow


I look around at my initials all over the store. I think about all the conversations we've had


Incident two:


Our coffeeshop gives a percent-of-profit donation to a charity that supports local cancer patients. So sometimes when people notice the sign that says that, notices our sign, and gets really emotional: maybe someone's in the hospital fighting cancer, maybe someone just died. It's a hard thing to handle: I aim for gentle smiles, handing them a napkin, asking if there's anything else they need. Sometimes gentle commiseration -- ""It's so hard, I'm sorry, I know


So. The topic of cancer comes up sometimes. I knew that my co-worker had three people in her family die of cancer, every time a customer mentioned the word ""cancer"": three rather distant relatives. I could have told you their names.


We'd had several conversations about cancer, a little bit, especially when we first started working and I was trying to open up to her a little to match our communication better. I'd also talked about my grandparents, all of whom had died in the last few years as well, three of cancer. The point is, my father's death, and the deaths of my grandparents, but it had come up.


So this day, after eight months working together, a customer comes in, notices our cancer charity sign, says a family member is in the hospital and she's really grateful we do this. 


""Yes, I nod, I make the customer's latte.


After the customer leaves


I smile a little at her. Maybe I'm just being too harsh on her


""What?"" she says. ""Your father is dead? I didn't know that! Oh


OH. MY GOD.


And that was the day I stopped trying to get along with my co-worker and started focusing on getting through the day instead.

This will make more sense to those that are familiar with the Harry Potter series. Even if you've just read the books, only not reprehensible abusers, and more gluttonous and oblivious to moral and social standing. They had thick English accents, but hailed from South Africa.

One average Saturday, physical description is irrelevant here. Child 2(C2) appeared to be around 9-10.

C1 was immature definitely

The father approaches us on the floor, information about the products he was looking for, etc.

While this was going on, and whining about being in a ""poor area."" These kids were poorly-raised, unrestrained, and on a path to being a detriment to society. I still hope that something whips them into shape, or they get some sense knocked into them. I still wonder what they're like now.

I eventually was helping the father out, charge packs, extra headset, etc). The entire time he stood with his eyes 3/4 of the way open and spoke with an accent I've only heard in BBC shows set in the late 1800s, that ""g'faw whatever"" kind of tone.

I couldn't care less about their attitude

It was clear he was elitist, and the father's response was pretty much to have them bring everything up and he'll buy it, no effort of parenting, just giving them what they wanted.

This was a huge deal in terms of sales for us, making it sound like I was doing him a favor because he was special to us, and he bought it. This guy was a gullible snob.

I've stated in a previous post that our membership costs $25 for a year

You could not get discounts off systems, 3 controllers, extra charge packs, headsets, an HDMI cable, and a mountain of games. His total was close to a grand. The effort to get him to spend this took less than 15 min, he was simply throwing money around to appease his undisciplined and spoiled kids.

I easily get him to sign up as I make it seem like he is an esteemed customer and were humbled by his patronage. In a sense we were

I sign him up for the membership, bratty kids still acting snobbish.

Not too much later

C1 and C2 are bickering, C2 thought he should have his own xbox and tv. This spoiled argument lasted a few minutes, the most notable sentence that is burned in my mind to this day. Imagine the most snotty, entitled, English accent: ""But da-Ddy, I want my OWN ex-box!"" I can't begin to describe how bratty that came out as.

Morally, whatever.

We ended up close to duplicating the order this man just purchased. He dropped money like it was nothing. He caved in to his whiny and spoiled kids and further reinforced those negative aspects. In the end this guy dropped well over a grand

Hello everyone. I've been lurking for a while and I figured I would share some of my experiences in the wonderful world of retail.

A word of warning: ACHTUNG!

And a now few more: If you are in a hurry, I urge you to save this for later, it is quite long.

Oh and also if you are at any point offended by incorrect use of gay, transgender, straight, lgbt or anything else for that matter, I apologize in advance. I am pretty liberal when it comes to the use of these words, that does not mean I don't know how other people feel about this.

Now then

This is a pretty small bar, it was decided that we would host big parties every month at a separate location.

In 2008 I started working at the bar. I started out as a lowly bartender, then on to further fame as a manager of the bar and in the end I moved on to being in charge of planning and hosting the parties. 

It was a swift climb through the ranks and I would be lying if I said I didn't leave some sore souls in my wake. However I was never in it for the power

Now that my life story is done

The Regulars:

note: I call our regulars by their standard orders. I am terrible with names and faces

**Pilsner and a Glass:** This is a 60 year old, and viciously attack with offers of drinks and a ride home.

There are plenty of these kind of guys around, but Pilsner and a glass? Never!

You would think he would try for something else sometime

**Double Scotch and Coke:** This guy never gets anything else, they know what they like. But this guy, he messes with one of my pet peeves. 

You see I can't stand it when people call Jack Daniels scotch. Why? Because it's wrong

But this guy INSISTS on saying ""a double scotch and coke"". And every time I ask him ""Jack Daniels?"" and he reples ""yes"".
I have tried to explain, even slightly annoyed, but it doesn't work. 

So one day, ever. But he did it and he looked at me with disbelief and tears in his eyes and choked out ""This coke's gone bad!"". Sigh... 

That was a couple of regulars

Now for the types. I would very much like to tell you about a specific type of people. **The straight guys**

The straight guys are a group of 3-6 guys out on the town. They're at the sports bar around the corner and have already had a few rounds. As they are sitting there talking up their egos by counting just how many girls they've banged this past week

**Lad#1:** ""You know what we should do? You fucking know what we should do? You know that fag place around the corner? yeah? We should go there and scare some queers!""

**Lad#2:** ""Fuck yeah! Let's bash some stinking fags!""

**Lad#3:** ""Let's do this!""

So they drink up and, but the minute they round it, they slow down. They begin to think, individually, that maybe this isn't such a good idea. But they can't let their mates know, so they keep on walking.

In the end they make it to the door

They have entered a gay bar

When they have entered the bar there are

**1:** They are aggressive and antagonizing

**2:** They are aggressive and antagonizing

**3:** My personal favorite. They are a bit uncomfortable

There are a million types; The bears, the straight girls, the baby dykes, the alternatives, the fazes and so many more.

1373344767.0,1hwyyp,Retiring from Retail -- Tales of Woe &amp; Redemption,retailjail,389,54,45,"To quote the Psychotic Sorority Girl &amp; Michael Shannon

This week I retired from retail. 

I’m going to share with you the craziest story of my time in retail jail. Until this week I was not allowed to discuss this with anyone outside of the people who already knew about it.  This took place in 2004. This story is going to be one of the longer things you have ever read on Reddit. Sorry. 

A middle-aged

He had me gather items from all corners of the store. I was grinning so hard my face hurt, dancing, totally enthralled.  My manager was calling district people and giving other associates high-fives, all the while completely unaware that this man was a certified nut-job. I will get to that later. 

We gathered up over $20, I got my first indication that something was amiss. He asked me to collect $500 dollars worth of CDs. ""What type?"" I asked. He got agitated and threatened to walk-out. I promptly drove the buggy to the music department and started raking in CDs to appease him.  This big fish was not getting loose. ""This enough???"" I shouted over my shoulder. It seemed to appease him for a moment, but I realized our time was getting sort so I made my way to the check-out lane.  

At this point I had an entire support staff at my fingers, doing my little monkey song-and-dance to keep him from crashing. It was a delicate time but we finally got to the point where I take payment. I thought I was in the clear, but little did I know the story was just beginning.  At this point I get my second clue that something was amiss. He decides to pay with an AMEX card, but he is fidgety...and refuses to show ID. I assume the card is stolen. I look at my managers and they assume the worst. We take a break and huddle in the back.

""If we check his ID and its good, I tell them that ""I'm going to land this one for the store."" I'm blinded by greed.

I go back out and almost literally throw myself at Mr. So-and-so's feet. ""Sir! Oh Sir I've done all I can do-- but we MUST have ID... it isn't MY policy... Lord no! I like you and I know you're just tired but...but..."" I beg. He finally relents.  I hold my breath for a moment and... Miraculously the ID matches the name on the card! Huzzah! I laugh and apologize about ten times while I swipe the card.

It gets declined. Every. Single. Time. 

The man is moving away from the register at this point. I flip. I say, a seat underneath his ass, and I'm calling the AMEX number on the back of his card.

""What seems to be the problem, would like to make a purchase. Things are fine until they ask to speak with him.  He is slurring his speech and genuinely sounds drunk at this point. This has become a horrible idea.  I'm starting to get sick to my stomach when Mr. So-and-so hands me the phone. They want to talk to ME. 

Long story short they say that there is a problem with the card

At this point,000 dollars, will completely ruin our entire store if it doesn't go through. We will have to explain to the district manager why we let a bumbling, psychotic, possibly drunk &amp; high person walk out of our store with $20,000 dollars worth of merchandise.  We realize that we will all lose our jobs if this goes sour. I'm checked-out at this point. I want to be anywhere but here. I am ready to call the whole thing off when Manager 1 gets greedy. 

""Tell him we can only do $10, we can at least say that we tried to play it smart.""  *This is anything but smart.*  They are begging me to go back out and talk to the guy.  He won't speak to anyone but me, and he's almost out of water. I relent.

""SSSIIIR..."" I throw myself at his feet again.  I detail exactly why we were suspicious

WHAT? This can't be happening... But it is. 

There is one caveat to his agreement.  We aren't taking away $10, and putting it onto another card. Why? I have no idea. The craziest part is this -- *he doesn't care where what we use to add the $5000 dollars.* 

Now, it stank to high heaven, but we did it.  We ran $10,000 dollars on one card and $15,000 on another. Where did we pull $5000 dollars from? Services. We offered to send someone out to set ALL THIS STUFF UP for him, and it came to $5000 dollars. 

Now

WE AGREED.  We agreed and the only stipulation was that it had to be performed THAT DAY. TWO HOURS LATER. 

At this point I will pause

Again, he is to CALL MY MANAGER. Then CALL THE COPS. 

I knock on the door. I can see Sam's face and he is near tears, and I mean *cases* of water, stacked as high as I am, 6 feet, throughout the room. Then, this happens:

""retailjail

""Well, and I think maybe we've made a mistake.""

""No. There are no mistakes. Me meeting you today was not a mistake. That's the reason I bought all that crap from you today. Because, and I know that you will help me. Do you believe in God? Are you a Christian, retailjail?""

Holy shit. Here it is.  This guy is going to KILL ME! Without speaking I turn for the door and open it. Sam sees me and I see him

Mr. So-and-so realizes that I'm genuinely terrified. ""retailjail, but just hear me out -- I promise I won't hurt you.""

I'm frozen in place. I can't move

""Over there

On top of the TV, but the implication was there. I had no reason to doubt him because, well, this guy was absolutely NUTS! Why wouldn't he have a stack of hundred-dollar bills as high as a soda can sitting on his TV?

""I want you to take that and give it to The Church."" He says calmly. ""Any church. Any church that believes in God. Take some for yourself

Bam. Something clicked in me, too. Sam was freaking OUT. he kept asking questions and I kept laughing. I made it a few miles and stopped the car. We just sat there for a few moments, not talking, just looking at each other. I was still laughing a bit. 

""That guy was F*ucking nuts."" I said. 

**Epilogue** Mr. So-and-so was an escaped mental patient. His wife had cheated on him and he had gone CRAZY the day before. In a short amount of time, I had a message to call THE POLICE in PHILLY. He had been reported missing and they were looking for him. They had a watch on his accounts, and when we ran his AMEX it flagged him. They took their sweet time calling us, and when they finally did I was already at the hotel. I was told that about 5 minutes after Sam and I left the hotel, our local PD had arrived and taken him into protective custody.

Yesterday, closing blinds), and a customer came walking in at five minutes to close, wanting to buy a new phone, which commonly takes fifteen to twenty minutes, from getting the phone and SIM card to the payment.

He said that he needed the phone to be fully activated before his supper reservations, and he could come back the next day to sign the contract papers and pay for it. I replied that we cannot do this, because it goes against company security and I'm not going to allow someone to leave the store with a brand new phone without paying.

He was absolutely FURIOUS. He said that the other man he spoke to earlier approved this(I'm the only male that has been working in this store for the last three years. It's only a four person staff) and then he demanded I get my manager for him(she wasn't there

So he eventually left, he was at the front door, waiting for us to open. Once I went to the front and unlocked it, he stomped right in, and spoke to my manager about my service last night. He changed the rules to make it sound like I offered to break the rules for him, but he refused because he wouldn't ""feel right"" about doing that. Fortunately, my manager didn't believe his story

As I've mentioned elsewhere, spray it with various things, clean car comes out the other end.  The interaction with the customers was very limited, so there wasn't much of a chance for yelling.  Pretty sweet gig in retail terms, if you didn't mind being wet all day and smelling like the underside of a soap dish.

But notice I said ""almost.""

The wash itself was a series of arching in a long tunnel, guided the cars into the correct position, took their payment or proof of payment, then sprayed down the car with a pressure hose and started the conveyor.  And always, ALWAYS, the prepper would tell the customer to take the car out of gear and keep their foot off the brake.  Not exactly hard instructions.  They were also posted on both sides of the tunnel entrance, hanging from the tunnel roof

But apparently, but I know that the prepper, who'd been doing this job for three years 5 days a week, never strayed from his script.

Well

And before you ask, foreshadowing!!

This other car was quite a bit larger than Sir MentallyIncompetent's.  A rather large and jacked up 4x4 pickup, and before you could do your best Vladimir Kulich ""PUT YOUR FOOT ON IT, AND STAND,"" the receiver buried itself up to the hilt smack in the middle of the poor car's hood.  And then, like any good warrior, it twisted the blade as the car continued forward, gouging a furrow through the metal 2"" wide and at least a foot long.

Oh, doesn't it?

The force of the impact moved the truck just enough so that it was out the end of the tunnel, that's funny.

Out jumps Lord High Marshall Douchebag and immediately lays into the two of us

The driver of the truck steps out, and declared that he was going to call his insurance carrier.  Rear Admiral Asshole says the same, whipping out his phone and taking lots of pictures first.  Ok, big deal, at least they seem to be treating it like adults.  The car wash is going to be shut down for a while anyway, as was policy whenever they was an accident down there.  I went back to the drying room and sat down to read.  Which was enjoyable, until a cop's face poked around the doorframe and asked to speak with me.

So someone decided that law enforcement needed to be involved.  Wonderful.  The cop asks me if it was possible for the car wash to push the car forward like Prince Moron of Peebles was stating.  I said no

Finally the officer has enough.  He tells the guy off for wasting police time, they all knew how it worked anyway, and that his attitude needed some serious adjusting.  The officer was going to write the report, and then send everyone on their way.  The truck driver stood there, nodding slowly and saying ""yes, sir"" occasionally, like this was all routine and nothing to get worked up over.  The Vapid 'Vette Vermin, was spluttering like a pot of chili trying to boil over.  The truck driver left placidly

The Corvette Cockbag then drove his beloved car a few feet away from the car wash, and called for a tow truck.  Really?  For a hole in your hood?  Wow, dude.  Finally the tow arrives, and with a finally threat of legal action for damages, he leaves.  Good riddance.

Of course, not Pauly Shore.  But after the owner pulled up the video that pretty clearly showed the car moving much faster than the chain, and saying that there was no way they were going to pay for the damages incurred by the user's stupidity, he gave up in exasperation.  Never did see the guy again, however I understand that his lawyer called the station owner several times, but the owner was adamant that we wouldn't be paying out and that he'd have to be taken to court first.

I know I mentioned that we dealt with drunk drivers quite a bit.  Such is the peril of working at a gas station that's near a major freeway.  I HATE people who drive intoxicated.  There is no excuse, I have zero respect for you, stop reading right now, and think about your life decisions before you kill someone.  Seriously.

It was late a night, and another attendant.  We'd done pretty much everything needed to close the place down, and were just waiting for the big hand to hit the 12 so we could close down the pumps, turn off the outside lights, do final sweeping/mopping inside, and go home.  In to the station rolls a guy on a motorcycle, a very nice Harley.

Now, I mean that he was the spitting image of [Edmund Gwenn](http://franklyhankblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/34-by-djabonillojr-2008.jpg) in *Miracle on 34th Street.*  I did at least three double takes at him, because he really DID look like Santa Claus, Hell's Angels Edition.  Full leathers, vest with patches, no helmet.  And he was drunk.  Not sloppy drunk, but definitely three sheets to the wind.

We had developed a bit of a routine when we dealt with DUII drivers.  We usually ended up with one or two a week that we would call in to the local cops, actually.

So biker Kris fumbles with his wallet while attempting to remain in an upright and locked position, which comes up with the error.  I apologize, and tell him that he'll have to run the card inside.  I brace myself for the usual angry drunk response, but instead the dude laughs.  Big, dumb grin.  Takes his card back, apologizes for his card not working, and makes a manful attempt at a straight line for the doors of the store.

The cashier gives me the signal that the pump is ready to go, I didn't want this guy trying to use a gas nozzle while standing over a hot bike engine).  I have it set on slow, and the other attendant is looking around the corner at me while talking to dispatch.  He gives me the thumbs up.  Boo-yah.

So St Nick comes back out of the store, but at least he's a happy drunk.  He comes up to me, and hands me the receipt from inside showing that he's paid.  Cool, bro.  On ya go.  Except that he doesn't immediately leave.  He digs into the bag, and pulls out a handful of ice cream sandwiches from our cooler.  ""Here you go, dude, it's a nice night, he deserves some

So the other attendant, and the three of us sit there eating in silence.  It was very surreal.  St Nick the Rider then throws the wrapper in the garbage, laughs once more, and revs up his bike.  We step back, and look across the street to see one of our local cops in the parking lot, engine running but lights off.  I surreptitiously give him the ""THIS GUY"" signal as he rolls out of the station, wobbles a bit turning the corner on to the street

*But then away from the station
*Ran through a red light
*up the on-ramp to the freeway to go*  
*where cop cars would be a little too slow*  
*when what to my wondering eyes should appear*  
*but several more units

They quickly disappeared out of sight, and we both had a laugh.

About 45 minutes later, and says he wants to tell us something.  Apparently, ol' Tomte had led the officers on quite the chase, running nearly 10 miles before finally giving up.  This was quite dangerous, because even late evening traffic on that stretch of road can be thick.  When they finally got him into custody, he blew a 0.19 BAC.  Someone had REALLY been into the Christmas spirits.

This is the story of someone who didn't have a choice but to steal. It gets a bit heavy at the end

Well, I'm working with the always tenacious Stacy. Stacy focuses in on this girl shopping the home department.  The girl was skinny, I mean, super skinny. She looked like she had just gotten out of a concentration camp, then went shopping at PINK and doused herself in make up to try to hide how emacciated she was. So naturally we will call her Anne Frank.

AF is fidgety.  Eyes darting around, and brings them up to the register.  Stacy and I are watching this, trying to figure out what the deal is. She's up to no good, but what?  AF buys two of the bed sets, and some towels, and says something to the cashier who keeps the third, unpurchased bed set, we thought

Stacy decided to keep following her on camera.  AF decides to go to lingerie

*Gotcha*.

AF then grabs some matching panties, I head downstairs to meet up with her.  As I arrive downstairs, I see AF back at the register, doing a return of some of the bras, and using the store credit to purchase the last bed set she had left there before. 

Now the cashier who was working was a nice guy. Decent worker
If it had two legs, he was DTF.  So naturally, despite the fact that AF looked like Snookie turned into Gollum, our cashier ""Luke"", was smiling and not paying attention at all. Anyways, Luke returns the bras, gives AF the bedset and the remaining money on a store card.  Now normally for shoplifters, and make a stop. However with false returns, and risk those items being thrown out?  Or should we wait till she exits and charge her with everything?

Sometimes its better to err on the side of caution. We waited till she exited the store and approached her.  She immediately tries to run. I get in front of her, and Stacy does a quick pat down.  Eventually we help her up, and escort her up to the office.

Stacy starts processing her, a syringe, and little baggie full of this substance. It looks weird, and half used, but the smell is unmistakable.  

Meth.

Now for those of you in other parts of the country, saying it's Joshua's fault, and she didn't have a choice. We are questioning her about how she had the money for two bed sets, but why steal for the third.  Suddenly her demeanor changed.  She perked up, and you could see something strange in her eyes.  She says she has the money for the one set, and she'll just pay for it and she will go.

Well now that doesn't seem right.  Something about us thinking only one set was stolen made her get excited... time to look at some tape.

We go back, then went up to Luke and returned them with no receipt for store credit.  This is a no no.  Any return without receipt over $100 was supposed to gain managers approval. After reviewing the tape, and pulling up Luke's transactions on our computer, we saw what happened. Luke, in an attempt to help out a busty girl, did several returns without receipts, making sure that each return stayed under $100 so he didn't have to call a manager.  Dumbass.

This is getting long winded and I'll begin to wrap it up, cute nose, gorgeous smile.  Now she was a shell of her former self.  Body slowly being drained by this addiction.  Cuts and holes in her face, eyes sunken and deadened.  Teeth chipped or even falling out.  Disheveled is the best compliment you could give her...  I ask her her story, and if she's willing to talk.  Stacy tended to be the agressive one of us, so I usually got them to co operate by being nice.  It definitely worked this time.  

AF was born in Miami.  Good family, a good girl.  Then she met this guy, he seemed cool, and he introduced her to Meth.  She was instantly hooked, and quickly become broke trying to get her next fix.  This guy, ""Joshua"" was her b/f. And he was a dealer.  He told her that Meth was huge and cheap up here, and that he was going to move up here and expand his network.  But he wanted her to go up first to live with his friend, flat out lied to her. Meth is so difficult to score around here, being pimped out to all of Joshua's ""friends and associates up here.""  

I remember her crying, we'll be together. It'll be ok. I won't have to suck anyone elses dick.  I'll have everything I need, I'll never need another fix. I just want Joshua.""

Nothing would convince her that she had been duped.  She didn't want help, or both, I'll never know. The cops came, did what they needed to do, and we told them the situation.  In the end she was charged with about $700 or so in theft and false returns.  One of the cops was a female cop we knew, and she said she would talk to her at the station.  Try and get her name to social workers and detectives who handle this type of thing.  As the cops were handcuffing her, Stacy was putting AF's things back into her purse.  AF screams ""MAKE SURE MY NECKLACE IS IN THERE! JOSHUA GAVE IT TO ME! I CAN'T LOSE IT HE'LL BE SO ANGRY!! PLEASE.""  Stacy held up this cheap looking silver chrome plated necklace. It looked like it cost less than $100.  But to her it was the greatest gift she'd ever gotten.  We placed it in her purse, reflecting how good we had it

1374968947.0,1j6sh9,Customer on Customer Takedown!,PoseidonsDick,398,69,23,"This is one of the greatest things I have ever witnessed in retail.

I worked as a commissioned sales manager in a popular shoe store catering to the midde-age demographic (primarily women). My store was located in a VERY wealthy area. The vast majority of our customers were very gracious and easy to work with, insane bitch who came through.

This happened during the Christmas season. In shoes, we all go every step of the way with our customers to provide them with full service. This means our sales are typically very involved and we follow through as best we can with the checkout process.

It was shortly before closing. There were three of us on - myself, the assistant store manager, and a part time sales associate. I was processing a lengthy return for a customer, the associate was ringing a lady out at the register next to me, and my boss was helping an elderly, disabled man try shoes on. He was not physically able, so she was putting the shoes on his feet, etc. So

As I'm working on this return, and taps her foot - basically trying everything she can to signal to me that she's annoyed. There's not a whole lot I can do because I'm at the register, but I say hello to her so that she'll know I recognize that she's waiting. She just glares at me.

About two minutes after she's standing there (my return was on three different receipts, the woman decides she can't take it anymore.

Woman (yelling): IS ANYONE IN THIS STORE GOING TO HELP ME OR DO I HAVE TO STAND HERE ALL THE DAMN NIGHT?!!?!

Now, as are our customers (who are all very patient and kind). I mean, damn, we have a non-able bodied person in the store, I'm so sorry that it takes time to ensure that person gets full service! I look at my boss, who looks at the man and he signals for her to go help the other lady. My boss takes the shoes from the lady as I try to salvage the situation.

Me: I'm sorry

Woman: I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR TWENTY MINUTES ALREADY!

Obviously a blatant lie...

Me: I'm really sorry about that

The woman sighs audibly, but...

Something happened that, at the other register, didn't feel the woman's outburst was appropriate, so she had one of her own. This is going to sound SO /r/thathappened, but I swear to god, I witnessed it with my own eyes and will never forget it...

Awesome lady: Are you serious right now? I mean, much longer than you, and they are helping us out as fast as they can. YOU ARE SO RUDE. SO RUDE!!!! SO RUDE!!!

And she continued to yell at the woman about how rude she was until the woman turned red in the face and briskly walked out of the store.

My boss returned with the shoes, ""We won't be needing those, she's left...""

Then I said to the woman

I owned a store that sold chocolates and candy. Mainly in gift baskets, they leave it at the door. So a large part of our job was keeping one eye on the kids while we were helping their moms pick out a gift. Because these moms, who were a little laissez-faire to begin with, seemed to think it was the staff's job to watch their children in exchange for them spending ten bucks with us.  I cannot tell you how many kids we had to stop from reaching all the way in to one of the bins with their dirty snotty hands and grabbing a fistful of chocolate. (Tip: If you're ever in a bulk candy store, don't buy anything less than 3 feet from the floor. We can't catch them all.)

One regular customer had a kid who was a nightmare. In addition to being so weird he creeped us out, I took a picture, and put it up on the wall with a big blue dot hiding his freakishly large head. We wrote on it: Please watch your children and always use the scoops!

This thrift store was an awesome place to work but it was located in a bad neighborhood. Since we also handed out free clothes and furniture to people who applied for it

My favorite win was one morning when I came into the store as a customer. The morning rush regulars had picked over the freshly stocked shelves and were in line at the checkout. I found a few goodies as well so I waited in line with everyone else. Our store was unique because nothing at the store was priced. We sold clothes

In line ahead of me was a gentleman who had his 8 year old son with him. The dad was known for being a douchebag to other customers but he had never messed with me. He had a cart full of electronics - CD players, the customers told the cashier what an item was so they could ring it up. As you can probably guess there were customers who would take advantage of this. It always pissed me off that they would rip off our store since this was a charity organization. We were like Goodwill but without most of the corporate overhead, million dollar stores and we used our profits for homeless shelters, food pantries and similar projects in our area.

The guy in front of me rattled off his purchases and told the cashier to ring up a VCR but the item was a CD player. A CD player costs $7 at the store but a VCR was only $2. Without thinking I politely noted that the item was actually a CD player and she rang it up as such. Unfortunately he picked that day to lock horns with me. He got in my face and sneered ""Who the FUCK are YOU"" followed by an short obscenity laden rant about my ""interference"". This didn't faze me a bit and I asked him to refrain from using such language in the store since there were children within earshot.  

I asked if he would like to speak to my manager and then glanced at the cashier. The regular store manager had the day off so the assistant manager - who was working register that day - was MOD. She figured out what was about to happen and nodded the go-ahead. The douchebag took the bait and requested to see the manager (although in far less civilized language). To top it off, smiled and said ""I am"".

The aforementioned silence was quickly broken by an anonymous laugh-snort followed by assorted guffaws and snickers.

Said douchebag wasn't seen in the store for months afterward. I later found out they were banned from the store for a month but stayed away even longer. Why? His mom wouldn't shop there because of what we did to her son.

A customer came in to do a return on several bedding items, so the cashier grabbed me to explain the policy. Here is the conversation (verbatim, actually, because the cashier recorded it for some reason):

Me: Ma’am

Her: *utterly incredulous* This is the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard! I want back what I paid right now! In cash! **This** is what’s wrong with America

Me: (*in my head* Wanna know what’s wrong with America? You, electronic banking and a basic policy—which is fairly lenient—are the fucking problem with America!)

*out loud* Ma’am, but I have to tell you that that will flag you in our system as a suspicious person and it may bar you from being able to do returns in the future, not to mention that I may not have enough cash in the register, meaning you’ll have to wait for someone to run to the bank to get change, and it may screw us over for the rest of the day. But if you need it **right** this second, I guess we can risk it **just for you**. (Yes, I was being a little condescending, I couldn’t get done while I was helping Ms. Ma’am)]).

Her: Then do that.

-.- Fuck you

So I do the return in three transactions, and as we’re finishing up, she says, “Was that so hard!?” Oh fuck you. We’re done here.

Me: Ma’am, you may not ever be able to do a return here again and we may be screwed for the rest of the day, but I did it, **for you**, because you couldn’t be flexible. If you want to be snitty about it, you can leave.

Oh her face. Priceless.

Her: How dare you talk to me that way!?

Me: Want me to get the manager? *calls for acting GM*

My acting GM comes out (the ASM from the fraud story) and asks what’s up. I told her to tell him. So she explains the whole thing to him and ends it with

GM: So what you’re saying is that after bending over backwards to help you out, and she told you to leave? What’s the problem?

Her: I can’t believe you are taking her side!

GM: Look, and she’s had a worse day today than I’ve ever had in my life, but here she is, helping you, and all you can say about her is that she told you to leave after you were rude. You know, you don’t have to shop here. In fact, you might want to start shopping catalog if you can’t treat my employees with respect.

Oh her face. I wish there were pictures. On the recording there is just this silence. It’s beautiful.

Her: Are you—are you banning me from the store?

GM: Not if you apologize.

Her: To **her**!?

GM: Yes. Those are your options.

Her: *mumbles almost inaudibly* Sorry.

Me: At this point, incidentally, is a hell of a lot safer than carrying that much cash) or wait for the send check.

Her: **This** is what’s wrong with America! Children being rude to their elders! You can’t even accept an apology!

Me: **You** are what’s wrong with America! You! I broke policy for **you** because **you** think **you** are special for being different. Take a long look in the mirror on your way out! *storm off to the back*

Now as you can imagine, I walked into the office and just sat down, waiting. I was as shocked as anyone that he defended me to the extent he did (he’s pretty good about backing up my decisions, but this was a little extreme and I know I’m not thinking perfectly), and I was expecting at the least to be scolded. Instead he had taken the cashier’s phone and played through the recording and laughed. For those wondering, this is what was said after I left:

Her: Can you believe she just said that!?

Cashier: She’s right… that’s what I was thinking.

GM: *to cashier

*Silence. Long

Her: *very softly* I didn’t really think about it like that. Please tell her I’m sorry. Sincerely.

GM: I will.

That’s where it stops. I’m a little in shock at the whole of it, **that’s** what’s wrong with America!

I worked for Hot Topic in the 90's, with recesses inside on the left and the right for display clothing. Those recesses were usually a tight fit for a full size ladder, so some gymnastics were usually performed if you were a guy to have a fully opened ladder. I usually just leaned it against the wall and reached into it (if my DM wasn't around, as it gave him heart attacks). Also important to note is that the cash register station (called the cash wrap) stood in the center of the store and had counters that were 3 1/2 to 4 foot high.

The holiday season was upon us and I had just hired about 10 new people. One of these guys, and a customer needed the last of an item that was on display in the front window.

""Hey Steve, for Steve was a *go-getter*, an up-and-comer, a man who was going to show me that he was worthy of staying on full time!

I see Steve burst out of the back room

You see, was my favored method as well.  But Steve had apparently slept through physics class in high school that semester, because instead of leaning the ladder against the firm, solid structure of the *wall*, he had instead chosen to test the tensile strength of the *display window*.  Yes, you read that correctly: Steve leaned a metal ladder against a 12 foot window pane and *started to climb*.

There are those cinematic moments in movies, here it was for me: watching Steve's left foot brace itself to bear his weight on the first step of the ladder, his pudgy, stocky fingers tightening their grip on either side of the rails. His bald head glistened in the 450-watt display lights; a drop was just about to slide down his neck. I could *feel* time slipping through my mental grasp like a physical thing and for a moment a sense of utter despair flooded my senses. And I must be honest with you- the despair was not for fear of poor Steve's health and wellbeing. The thought that first crossed my mind was: Jesus, I hired this dipshit.

And then, heaved, then *snapped* back into place, and I could feel the pain in my wrist as it and my arm bore my weight in a bound *over* the cash wrap, legs swinging over and kicking useless trinkets (only one dollar, a great stocking stuffer!) to the floor, barely registering the ""O"" look on the return customer's face. And that screaming, will someone please fucking STOP THAT SC- oh

He was on the second step and the window was bowing out with his weight, all 200 stupid, senseless pounds of him, on top of me, and god, I wish I could say I blacked out and had a moment's respite from this ridiculous dramaturgy, but no. I was still fully conscious and fully *furious*, all I could manage to sputter out were syllables that somewhat resembled ""window

The ending of this tale is much more mundane than the climax I'm sorry to say. I moved the ladder to a much safer position, because I had seen the future, and it was Steve.

There's a clothing store in Australia, teenage girls, but they do have really cheap wardrobe basics like plain colour singlets and maxi dresses. I saw a particular dress that I actually liked (and it was super cheap as well), so I decided to pick my size off the rack and took it to the register.

I'm not a particularly big girl, the girl looked at the dress and says to me ""Are you sure this will fit? This one only goes up to an XL."" You could tell by her smirk that she was not trying to be helpful. I dropped it on the ground and told her to fuck off, and walked out of the store.

Now I notice a line in front of the door to get in. And I see two gentlemen online with their children. One guy has on a blue shirt and I see him as the first person on line since he was in the front and the guy behind him has on a brown jacket. We finally get down to 10 children and I ask my coworker what does she want to do since I'm leaving. She tells me to take two more children and that's it for the night. So I inform the guy in the front that I can take his two children and that's it. The guy behind him is pissed and insists that he was first on line and I tell him that no he wasn't. He was second and the man in front of him was first. The same guy is still arguing with me and now the other parents are looking confused as to what's going on. This is exactly how this scenario went. 

I take a few of the free ice cream coupons and go from behind the counter so all the parents can see and hear me and I say 
""I apologize for the inconvenience but we are closed for the evening due to being over capacity and we can not take in anymore children since I'm leaving and my coworker can not have over a certain amount of children. But what I can do is offer your children free ice cream to make up for not being able to come into the ballpit. Again I do apologize for the inconvenience."" 

Most parents and their kids are ok with this since I did offer free ice cream cones (who doesn't want that?). So as I am passing them out to the parents so they can leave
""Sir I'm sorry but that man was first. But I can offer your child free ice cream instead."" I try to hand him the coupon and he pushes my hand away with his fingers

Now I'm looking at this man with his hand on my arm in disbelief that he just put his hands on me. All politeness is gone at this point. I look him in the eye and say angrily 

""Sir you need to take your hands off of me right now."" (I was seriously about two seconds from slapping him) 

He moves his hand and says that he's going to report me to my manager and I tell him ""Go ahead and I will tell her and security that you touched me."" 

He huffs off with his son at that point.

I happen to be one. Not a great one but still, because I figure he wants to ask about my camera, or how to get his granddaughter a photography job.

""Khan you take piktur ove my teeth?""

Now, or maybe that he was **really** new to English. So I said, ""Your teeth? Like a portrait of you smiling?"" I crack a great big smile and point to it to get the point across.

""No

Turns out he was pretty new to the country, if I heard through the accent correctly. The dentist had given him a list of okay foods and not okay foods and they had broken off and fallen out in the middle of a meal he was eating. And the food was on the okay list.

So he was mad. He wanted photographic evidence that the things were broken

Whatever

I put the teeth there, multiple times, and then leaves.

A week or so later he comes back to the store and thanks me again, and you were nice,"" elderly people. We actually had a pretty interesting conversation. He had a ridiculously advanced degree in mechanical engineering and had specialized in laser arrays and high-end experimentation back in the Republic. He came here and taught for a bit, but only some of his credentials were good in Canada, the position went away and he was living off a pension. Her found out I went to school for journalism during one of these talks.

Another week goes by and he comes in every couple days, inquires about some random photo thing (I'm sure he was preparing things especially to come talk to me about) and then would leave. I was fine with it cause he was being harmless.

He came in another time with a letter to a hospital administrator about a doctor who flat out told him the chest pains he was having were nothing. He was taken to the hospital later that day when he had a mild hear attack. The letter was a complaint and a demand for the doctor to be fired or he would take the story to the media and sure for malpractice. He asked if I wouldn't mind editing it for him so it sounded good in English. He didn't want to be dismissed as some dumb foreigner.

**Sweaty Jeans Guy and His Band of (Asshole) Thieves: A Christmas Tale**

Have you ever hated someone? Like TRULY despised them, ""Lela"" had been after this group since she started.  There were three main culprits. Now I debated about using real names because fuck them, but decided to not anger the great mods of r/talesfromretail.  So we shall call them Lexi, Lebron, and Fat Tony.

Anyways this group apparently started becoming an issue when Lela started working for B&amp;D.  Lexi was a heroin addict.  In and out of jail and rehab.  We eventually learned that she had been a major thief in the past, was Lebron. Lebron was a talk athletic guy, and was the ring leader of the group.  He would often play look out and run interference if you tried to stop Lexi from leaving the store. This included distractions, or for one poor mall guard in the past, getting sucker punched in the back of the head.  The third member was Fat Tony, he often worked alone, but was traveled with the group, and would hit stores at the same time as Lexi, sometimes for minutes on end.  She was smart, and laugh in your face as you watched her walk out the store.  She would come back the next day

Anyways enough background:  So one day Fat Tony walks into our ""Follister"" brand store.  He is looking at colognes, already having been briefed about him.  My co worker Lela proceeds to our B&amp;D store to look for Lexi.  Eventually Fat Tony gets a phone call and peaces out before making a move. One of the managers pulled me aside and said ""That's Sweaty Jeans Guy!"". To which I suavely replied ""What?"".  Flaring nostrils and sultry eyes and all. Somehow, this manager was able to look past my charmed confusion, and explained:

One Day, and immediatly went into the fitting room, going under the door so as to avoid having an associate open it for him.  An associate saw all this, alerted a manager, and the manager started knocking on the door, asking if he needed help, if he wanted 6 shirts to match the 6 jeans he brought in there.  Silence.  Fat Tony didn't say a word. But this manager was a scrappy little girl and wasn't going to let him pretend like he wasn't in there.  She's not a T Rex. Her  eye sight isn't attracted to only movement! And she'd be damned if she'd let him treat her this way!   So our scrappy young lass bravely clamored against the door, and sweating profusely.  She tries to act like a good associate, that that they marked it as defective
 
Gross. Also

**Here is where it all wraps up kiddies**:

So for the first two months I was working for *B&amp;D*, from *GDNickels*, and the three of us were finished training right before Christmas. So the company allowed us to work together at Lela's malls for the holidays and after the new year we would go to our own malls. So we were enjoying our time, getting some good grabs during the busy holiday season, but nothing BIG.  Anyways, Christmas Eve morning, we meet up bright and early. As we are sipping our coffee inside a store across from the main *B&amp;D* store, around $200 each, Lela and Stacy hang around, I step in front of him.  He stops in his tracks

Here's where I got my Christmas gift:  Fat Tony's phone starts ringing.  Why it's Lexi texting him. Saying Mall Security is everywhere and they all need to leave. Where is he. Should they lay low. Whats going on?  We ask the cops if we can text her saying our store is clear and nab them when they come to steal.  The cops say they can't do that, and its a treasure trove of ORC data.  Lists of items requested.  Pics of his car ( which was immediately looked for by the cops). Messages between him and the Fencers about items he's stolen over the last few weeks.  We have him dead to rights. ( Only down side was there were a few nudes of FT posing on his bed in a seductive manner. *Cringe*  Then we hear the cop's walkie going off. Lexi spotted mall security and took off while Lebron is trying to fight them. So one cop goes to assist.  We ended up bagging all three whether through theft or assault and trespassing charges.  Lexi and Lebron both had illegal methadone pills on them, and had the baby with them so were charged with risk of injury to a minor as well. It was the best Christmas Eve Retails Morning a boy could ask for. 

And then the proudest moment of my life, you filthy animal. And a Happy New Year.""

Not in a Garfield kind of way. No, especially when people begin to wear you down with their nonsense.

Well today was no different. I got off my break at around 5pm, right after I put my lab coat back on, it started and did not stop for 3 hours. 

Personally, snag your drugs, and get you on your way in less than 5 minutes. However, if one of the many things go wrong, it takes a long time to fix (if we even can), and we get in trouble if a person stays at the window for too long. And here is where my story starts.

About one hour into nonstop customers at drive-thru, but this isn’t surprising. I get her name/birthday/address and type it into the computer. Bing! She has one ready in the waiting bin. The conversation goes like this:

Me: Ok Mrs. GW

GW: Wait

Me: Ok do you remember what doctor prescribed it?

GW: It was Dr. Blah! She said she sent it yesterday.

It’s seriously annoying how often doctors don’t call in prescriptions when they tell their patients they did.

Me: Well I don’t see it

GW: No! I’m going to call her right now!

Me: Ok, so you’ll need to either come inside or pull around to the back of the line.

GW: I’m not coming inside!

Me: Then please pull around.

She drives off a huff,

GW: Here’s the doctor! Talk to her!

Me: Uhh sure. Hi this is Uptown

MD: *annoyed* Ok so just refill Mrs. GW medication.

Me: But we don’t have an original prescription for it.

MD: Fine. Give her thirty of the 10 milligr-

Me: Actually, only my pharmacist can.

MD: Fine

Me: Again

GW overhears me saying this

GW: What?! Why can’t you just give my phone to the pharmacist?! I’ve done that before!

Me: Ma’am

GW: Well fine

Me: Then you’ll have to either come inside or pull around since there are people behind you.

GW: UGH *drives away*

So, GW pulls up again.

GW: Well is it ready yet?!

I go check

Me: Yep! *I was actually cheerful since I was happy to get rid of her* So that’ll be $50.

GW: WHAT?! Why is it so expensive?! 

Me: Well your first script is only $6

GW: UGH! Fine

Me: Ma’am

GW: I AM NOT CALLING MY DOCTOR BACK!

Me: Then

GW: NO IT’S TOO EXPENSIVE! JUST GIVE ME THE GENERIC!

Me: Ma’am I told you

GW: WELL I’M NOT LEAVING UNTIL ITS CHEAPER.

Me: *defeated* Ok one moment

So I go up to the pharmacist who’s neck deep in work and explain what’s going on. I tell him that Mrs. GW refuses to leave until we give her a cheaper option. Yes

So my pharmacist says, and we need a new prescription if you want the other one. You can either buy it or not”

GW: *super cheerful* Ok! I’ll just buy the medication then. Thank you so much.

FUCK YOU!!! What the fuck was that?! You just gave me so much bullshit

And the worst part was after all this happened

No, she’ll complain to corporate. If corporate hears this then my pharmacist get in trouble. If the pharmacist gets in trouble, I get in even worse trouble.

This story does have a happy ending however. The next day Bryant Young came in(his name is ok, my gf is that kind of person).

That following day we had the interviews, and a gave me a firm handshake, he was friendly to our secretary, and just an all around great guy. He nailed the interview, and i hired him on the spot.

The rest of the interviews went well, but, he was wearing a dirty T-shirt and torn jeans, had a unkempt beard and smelled terrible. I normally would have rejected him on the spot, but, we were desperate for people and I wanted to see where this would go.

he nailed the interview, his personality said he was a real straight shooter. I was impressed, I against my better judgement gave him the job. I put him as cart pusher, much to his dismay. I just couldn't justify placing him anywhere else, I had my doubts and cart pushers didn't require you to have much going for you.

he passes his drug test, but, i convinced her to give him a shot. I pray this guy does well because this would reflect badly upon me, but, what can I say? I felt this guy could be a damn good worker once he cleans up his act, or maybe I was just foolish and too inexperienced. 

Flash forward a week, I just want to strangle him because he's so damn arrogant. He talks down to everyone, including the customer. He thinks because he once worked a ""real job"" and has a fancy degree from a big university that justifies talking down to everyone. Everyday i get complaints from employees about his behavior, about him refusing to do something or talking down to a customer.

While Sharp Dressed man is obnoxious, but, they are required to help customers and just be friendly. But, even though Cart Pushing isn't the most demanding job in the store, it's still important and so when i hear he's done a fine job as a Pusher and extremely friendly and helpful towards customers, well, that makes me pretty happy.

Occassionally, for a great deal. Each coupon actually scans and takes off $10 from the total purchase price, but the coupons don't actually come from our store. When we spot these coupons, we notify everyone out on the floor. Where there's one, there's at least four more. The coupons are taken away from the ""customer"" and we proceed with the transaction.


On one particular day


""Why not?""


""We haven't e-mailed $10 coupons that I know of but if you'd like, trying to be pleasant to defuse the situation.


""You better


I check with my manager over the walkie who confirms that the coupon isn't valid.


""I'm sorry but my manager says we're unable to take the coupon."" (We try to take the coupons away so they can't use them at a different register. At this point


The woman becomes enraged. ""YOU NEED TO GIVE ME THAT COUPON BACK! THAT COUPON IS VALID! WHY WON'T YOU TAKE IT?!""


At this point


""We can't take that coupon because it's fake. We haven't given out $10 in over a year and they have no plans of giving them out anytime soon. That's why."" 


She then calmly asks for the coupon back.


So, then handed it back to her with a smile on my face.


That really made her mad. She demanded my name which I gladly have to her. I even wrote it on the coupon then I encouraged her to contact our store management if she had any issues with my not taking her fake coupon.

I work at a movie theater where we not only sell popcorn and soda, and has 16 different ice creams on display in a giant freezer for people to pick and choose from, like Ben &amp; Jerry's or Baskin Robbins. For each shift, there's one person trained on the Cafe (which happens to be me on this particular Saturday night) and the Manager.

It's normal for a family to come up and get a bunch of ice cream together, tbh) that came up. The conversation went as such:

Man: ""Okay

Me: ""We have waffle

Man: ""Okay. What is smallest cone?""

Me: ""That would either be the sugar or the wafer cone

Man: ""Okay

Me: ""All righty

Man: ""Superman. One scoop Superman

I nod and get his order for him

Man: ""Oh

I go and get another one of the same thing. Again, repeat his order back to him, and ring up his total.

Man: ""I'm so sorry

Me: ""Okay

Man: ""I need... 15 of these."" -points to the cones in his hand-

I pause. This is unusual. Somebody does not just order 15 ice cream cones randomly.

Me: ""You want 15 ice cream cones?""

Man: ""Yes.""

Me: ""All the same thing?""

Man: ""Uh, looking inside- ""I want 1 Moose Tracks, 2 chocolate, 1 mint...""

About ten minutes have passed, so she sends a fellow coworker over. She doesn't know Cafe, all she has to do to help me is scoop 15 cones of ice cream. We bring more cones from the back to complete the order, and the man grabs a tray to carry all the cones in. He sets his original two down, and pass the ones we make to him. Finally, he has his total of 17 cones, almost each one a different flavor, and swipe his credit card no problem. He walks away with his tray of 15 cones and seems content with his purchase.

A few minutes later, so I make them and ring up the 5. Right after I swipe his card, though, he says that he doesn't need them anymore. I call my manager over for a refund, and he walks away empty-handed.

Right before we close, I hear the little boy that is with her say:

Boy: ""Mommy

Woman: ""Sshhhh...""

I don't say anything, and it's just coincidence that the little boy said that. I think this until I swipe the credit card, which happens to be the same thing as the man's.

I give them their ice cream, saying that his son of dropped his cone. I reply that I need the cone to spoil it out in our inventory, and so the little boy runs to get it. The man is impatient now, and decides to just purchase another one - a wafer cone, this time with Moose Tracks.

So, as it doesn't happen often, and I'm not sure what exactly was going on. I have plenty more stories, but this one sticks out as one of the weirdest.

**TL;DR: Single customer wants 2 ice cream cones, changes his mind, is refunded, walks away empty-handed. His wife and son come up, with the son saying, ""Mommy, why are we getting more ice cream if daddy just threw all of it away?"" order 1 ice cream cone with his credit card, saying a different son dropped his ice cream,self,

My manager, he was also a pathological liar.  Don was fairly new to his position and nothing he did was ever right.  If there was something to mess up, he would screw it up beyond repair.  For example, he broke one of the expensive dress shirt fixtures that is essential to my department that hasn't been replaced to this day.  He was also lazy, he would disappear for hours into a room adjacent to one of the fitting rooms (this is important later).  For these reasons, the store manager had it out to get him fired or transferred even though he was brand new.

Onto the MEAT of the story:

Loving the job, emptying tills of Notes (taking out £1000 in a FISTFULL is SO satisfying), banter with colleagues.

The queue (scrum of people) for the bar is 4 deep

I see a problem developing. in the mass infront of the bar there are 2 guys arguing very loudly at each other

Get by BIG ASS VOICE ON. (6""6 tall I can single people out easy).

Me: ""Hey Guys"" - Get their attention over the bajillion decibels of Skrillex being pumped out.

Me: ""You need to stop that argument or you wont be served."" - Get the nods. Crisis averted. Friends try to steer them apart.

2 minutes, tits and tongues on the dancefloor.

Me: ""Hey guys

Hand gets put in my face. Right. Plan B. Moi.EngageBeast(FULLFURY); function called.

""OI

""Moi to Security . . . "" - He realises I aint messing. My staffs safety is no.1. I don't want this guy at the bar.

BG: ""Whateva fuckhead"" He leaves. I give security a description

Half an hour later WG approaches the bar

WG: ""Hey man, he's said sorry. I don't really want to ruin his night.

Me: ""Don't worry man

BG approaches the bar.

BG: ""why you serving him?"" - He's got another scowl on his face

Me: ""He said sorry

BG: ""you're just not serving me cos im black! you a fucking racist man!"" - Race Card = alarm bells.

Me: ""I'm not a racist

Today, I wants me some noodles and marinara.  So I hove myself off my nice comfy couch and away from reruns of Dirty Jobs, and headed to the local store.  Tis a rather large edifice department and grocery store, similar to Walmart but higher class and locally based.  As I stood in the spice aisle, pondering whether or not I should get some basil for this evening's repast, I noticed a curious scent.  Definitely not the kind of smell you associate with the spice aisle, this was obviously THAT kind of herb.

I turn and see a young man, I mean he is HHHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH.  He's past the point of thinking he's growing deer antlers.  He's so high his component molecules are randomly blipping in and out of existence.  He's so baked Betty Crocker could use him as a spokesmodel.  He's so blazed I didn't want to approach him without bunker and SCBA gear.  Snoop Dogg himself would tell him to tone it down a few notches.  [10]^^10

I hope I'm painting an adequate picture here.  The dude was really high.

I realize that my 5-minute trip to the store was about to go a little longer, I'm from Portland, I've NEVER seen someone that far gone before).

And oh, I wander along behind him as he makes his own voyage of discovery through the wild lands of the Spice Aisle-lands, the steep sides of the Paper Towel Valley, and the deep jungles of Men's Apparel.  Here our hero stopped to ponder the ancient mysteries of a red-and-white striped tie, which apparently held as much interest for him as the Rosetta Stone did for Jean-François Champollion.  What secrets did it's nylon fibers hold?  Unfortunately for our intrepid explorer, a more pressing matter suddenly came to his mind:  MUNCHIES.

Retracing his rather wandering steps, stared lovingly at the bags of Milanos, even held his breath in excitement upon finding a treasure trove of Bugles.  BUT WAIT!!  The Motherlode!!  Manna from heaven!  Ambrosia!  The Nectar of the Gods!  CRUSTABLES!!  One sweep of his no-doubt-nerveless arms, and a veritable bounty of those delicious snacks were now his.

But, this time heading into the produce area (by this time I'm bright red in the face from trying to hold back laughter) on a mission to find the perfect mate for his self-contained PB&amp;J sammiches.  Like a fine gem collector he perused the tables of fresh veggies, until he stopped and reached for a single, solitary source of vitamin B5.

An avocado.

A smile crept across his face, waving a giant sunflower and singing ""Happy Days are Here Again"" and he wouldn't have noticed me.  He was now on a mission.

Being that it was later in the afternoon, rather busy.  12 lanes are open, and each one has three or four people in line.  That kind of crowd and noise was daunting and confusing to our brave shopping warrior.  He stood back from the lines, his body language simply saying, ""Aww, man...""  But hope was rekindled, when he spied out of one very bleery eye the U-Scan area

But here in lies the final challenge.  Working the U-Scan.  I took my purchases (I had decided to forgo the basil and just use oregano, the kind and helpful customer service attendant working there realized the young man's predicament, and went to assist.  She instantly realized what the situation was, and slowed down her speech so that he could understand what was going on.  I'm pretty sure he didn't anyway, but he did manage to put all his valuable victuals into a sack, hand a wad of cash to the attendant, mumble out something extremely unintelligible but was probably a variation on ""thank you, stopped next to the attendant to share a laugh

The last I saw of him, and towards the much lower-traffic roads of the residential area behind the store.  I sat down in my car, and started laughing so hard I was crying.  Now, it's time to make some dinner.

[My last story

First off, a charity event for an AIDS foundation, a children's theater production of A Year with Frog and Toad, a performance by the Vancouver BC Ballet, and tomorrow I'm doing a symposium hosted by two US Representatives and the Dalai Lama.  The money's good, but my back and feet are screaming at me.  But I'm complaining, when I should be telling a story.  Forgive this old man, and I'll spin ya a yarn.

The end of November is a big social/cultural event here in Oregon.  No, homes, senior centers, churches, restaurants, or any place with a flat surface and a projector; and the city of Eugene (or Corvallis, this year it's in Eugene) turns into a massive charlie foxtrot of drunks, lost drivers

As traffic crawled along the interstate, the pumps were lined up 10-12 deep, and I had a line of at least a dozen in the store.  My customer service smile was firmly locked in ""holy shit this is a nightmare did you find everything you were looking for"" mode, and I was ringing people up as fast as I could go.  LOTS of beer was being sold, which is no big surprise.  In walk five guys (no, not the burger place, that was across the street) who look to be in their mid 20s, grab a couple cases of Bud Light, and plonked down their beer and some snackable materials.

""Morning guys.  Find everything you need?  Looking forward to the game?""

Smiles, got it all, totally stoked to see what Masoli can do, blah blah blah.

""Can I see everyone's ID

This is where things took a sharp turn into Notsofunville.  Four of the guys dug for their wallets, the fifth guy suddenly stops smiling, crosses his arms, and frowns in a most menacing manner.  One of his friends notices and tells him to pull out his ID.

""I'm 28 and from Canada

Before his friend can gather his jaw up off the floor

""Sir

""I just told you

""I understand

At that point

""I'm not showing you my ID.""

""Then I'm afraid I can't sell you guys the beer

At this point, his hand gripped the handle of the knife, and gently tugged at it.

Remember, WARNING, DANGER WILL ROBINSON, DANGER!!**  I instantly slipped into a combat stance, placed my right hand on my own knife, my left on the edge of the counter, and removed all pretense at customer service by bellowing at the guy in a much lower and louder tone

Now, he didn't actually pull the knife out, or say anything threatening.  Why the incredibly strong reaction?""  Good question.  About two weeks earlier, while I was on a vacation, the store had been robbed at knife point.  The kid who had been covering for me had been cut pretty badly, and had refused to come back to work after the incident.  I was extremely sensitive about the subject.  To the point where I had stopped carrying my dinky little Swiss Army knife and started carrying my Kershaw SpeedSafe Blur, an assisted-opening lock blade with a tanto cut and half serrated.

However, but managed to somehow manipulate my facial features back into something resembling a smile.  I told them that I wasn't going to sell to them, but if they still wanted beer, there was a grocery store up the street.  I also recommended they keep *that guy* in the car.  They apologized again and left.  Meanwhile the rest of the customers in the store, about 10 or so, stood in mute shock for a few seconds, as I took a couple deep breaths.

**The Time I Arrested Pre-Teen Ne-yo**

One day, when I see a young boy and girl (around age 12 or so), in our Junior's department. The girl quickly runs through the store, and into the bathroom.  I continue to watch the boy, who is doing something with a shirt in the corner, but I can't tell what.  Stacy heads out to the rest room to see what the girl is doing.  A few minutes later she comes back, and says the girl is washing purple Ink off her hands

Well now it all makes sense. The two geniuses had popped a security tag full of ink while trying to remove it.  Eventually the girl comes back, and not 3 feet from the kids, grabs the ink covered shirt off the rack, and hands it too an associate and said ""Hey Becky, here's a shirt someone messed up.  Can you just send it back to the warehouse to be processed as damaged.  Hopefully we won't have to send anymore back.""  The two kids, the whole time, are staring dead at her, WHICH IS IN THE JUNIORS DEPARTMENT

So we figure they will get the hint

Well obviously I wouldn't be tell you this story if that was what happened.  I don't know what their thought process was, and make the stop.  They come back to the office with us.  We ask them where there parents are.  They say they are orphans.  We tell them to let us know because we can't let them go if their parents aren't here.  So that's when the boy, who we will call Ne-yo, says ""Well she's my cousin.""  

Me: Your cousin. And you're BOTH

Neyo hesitates before going ""Yeeeesssss?"" as if he was waiting for me to tell him he got an answer correct.

Me and Stacy just look at each other and begin our paperwork. The girl is crying, and he tells me its the songs of his people, and calms her down.  Ok.  Once again, we were waiting on the cops for over an hour. So Ne-yo suddenly decides to start asking us questions about our family, our hobbies, what our job is (despite being in our office), and finally our beliefs.  I tell him we really can't talk to him about any of that, so we should be able to talk about him! You love Jesus don't you?""  I tell him I'm not Christian

Ne-yo: Well you know if you don't believe in Jesus

Me: Kid, quietly please.

Ne-yo glared at me with the same hatred you see a Vegan giving someone eating delicious

ME: Thought you said you were an orphan?

Ne-yo then decided his hole may be deep enough, his mother I'm assuming, and he just kept singing.  Me and Stacy were getting pretty annoyed but we couldn't just leave the room.  Eventually Ne-yo starts asking to use the rest room.  I tell him we aren't allowed to do that.  He says he needs to go. I tell him by law I can't escort him to the rest room, and he'd have to wait for the police.  We sat like this for the next 15 minutes, him asking me every couple minutes if he can use the rest room.  

Eventually, the cops were just about here, so I told him to just wait. we explained to the officer what was going on.  He asks the kids their names, dates of birth all that. He then asks where the kids parents are and how to get in contact with them.  Ne-yo just looked at him and said ""Do YOU believe in Jesus?"" .  The cop looked at me, and just shook his head.  Eventually he brought them to the station to wait for someone to report them missing.  Only thing I heard about them after that was that it took till almost midnight for someone to report them missing and turn up for them.  And that Ne-yo was asking questions the whole damn time, annoying the cops there.

One day, just to browse a little and kill some time. While I was there, I ended up stumbling upon an item I had been looking for for a *long* time (can't remember what it was now, just goes to show how unimportant it was in the grand scheme of things, but I *really* wanted it at the time). Stoked, I headed over to the cash registers, where only two cashiers were on duty. 

I got in line right behind a large woman who had plopped an enormous pile of clothing and housewares on the counter. Never breaking the smile on her face, this was a thrift shop, so 85 bucks worth of merchandise is a LOT of stuff.  It took a while, but the other cashier had a much longer line, so I figured the wait time would be about the same either way. I was sadly mistaken.

The lady paid with her debit card and was just about to gather her things and leave... when suddenly, wait, I have a coupon!"". Nearly pushing me over, she approached the cash and handed over a coupon to the cashier that said something like 'Spend 100 dollars or more, get 50% off'. Pretty sweet discount, I know. The thing is, the lady who had just purchased all of that stuff now wanted the cashier to hold up the line so she could run and grab another $15 worth so she could use the coupon — which was not only really unfair to the other customers who had been waiting patiently, since the transaction had already been completed. I know that in most retail stores you can return items and get your money back

The cashier kept trying to calmly explain that it wasn't possible to reverse the transaction, but that the cash register system simply wasn't capable of undoing the purchase. After about ten minutes of going in circles, she called the one and only manager on duty over to help deal with the problem. She looked at me and the others behind me apologetically and told us ""This is probably going to take a while, so you may want to switch over to the other cash."" I felt awful for her — she had been so nice about the whole thing and the two women were both acting so outraged and entitled (I think I even heard one of them accuse her of being racist, an accusation that sickens me when it has no merit). 

A few minutes after I went to the other line, but the manager was busy dealing with the two angry women and couldn't come over and help). I waited for another ten minutes with no sign of it being my turn anytime soon, when I realized I was going on 20 minutes late for lunch. Sadly, I had to put my item back and leave the store empty-handed. I went back for it another day and it was gone. 

All because of a couple of old hens and their *fucking* coupons.

Fit the Second

Another U-scan incident.  However

The date was late September of 2008.  I had returned just a week earlier from a summer of fighting wildfires for the federal government, it's in The Code.  So, Mountain Dew in hand I wander over to U-scan to pay and maybe make fun of her hair or something.

When I approach, cross my arms, and listen as the guy prattles on about something something something not the right price blah blah blah rabble rabble *just do it right you vapid cunt!*

Whoa dude.

Now, I had dropped almost 50 pounds and gained a fairly significant tan.  While not up to Ryan Reynolds' body standards, I was still very trim and fit.  And also very, very angry.  I grabbed this....human effluence....and spun him around so he was nose to nose with me.

Well, and in a very quiet, very growly voice, said simply, ""*WHAT* did you just say to my little sister?""

He instantly went from the bright-red of a raging douche-nozzle customer to the pale white of a man afraid for his life.  His eyes were so wide I was surprised his eyelids didn't start clapping behind his head.  He backed up

I looked up to see my sister with her hands on her face and tears on her cheeks.  ""Fucker made my sister cry.  He's a dead man, until I realized that the hands and tears were because Lori was laughing hysterically.  She was, in fact, doing the retarded seal laugh, you know, when you make almost no sound except a strange bark when you inhale, while clapping your hands together like an exhibit at Sea World.

Around this time the other customers were beginning to laugh as well.  My anger subsided and I chuckled myself.  It's not often that you get to scare white into a guy's hair like that.  Supposedly he's never been seen again.

1347656267.0,zw93f,McChildCare,SilentDis,375,61,70,"This happened a long

I was still in high school, for a rather large tourist area in the Midwest.

It was common for 'kids', way too long during the summer.  Given that bodies were needed everywhere to serve the tourists, most employers didn't care, either, and would simply pay the fines if they were 'found out'.  Most cases, it was entirely consensual 'exploitation' on the part of the minor (myself, 17 years old) and the employer.

I was scheduled to work the night shift that day, and what 17 year old didn't want to make overtime pay when they had nothing else to do, anyway?  Plus, at first, I was told I'd get to take off before close.

I worked my ass off, on counter order, migrated to grounds cleaning (tidying the seating/washroom/playland), back to counter, etc.  I was all over the store, and having, in all honesty, it was busy

I vaguely remember serving a lone child at some point on the tills... probably around 1PM.  That wasn't uncommon; parent hands the kid money, wished him a good day, and proceeded on serving the endless line of people behind him.

Around 6PM I managed to break off the counter and get the lobby tided up; no small task, and made my way into playland.

This was an old-school outdoor playland that many McDonald's had.  Plastic playset with swings and such, a plastic and metal [Mayor McCheese](http://imgur.com/Bh0el) you coluld climb up, then climb around in.

I had just started cleaning out there, I remember a kid sitting alone, at one of the tables.

9PM comes around
""SilentDis
""Of course
""You're already on overtime?""  
""I have been since I started today."" (week rolled over that day)  
""Well... screw it

I closed that night.  All the way to midnight.  At the end of it all, and we were finally empty, they told everyone to grab something to eat, something to drink, and get the hell out to the play area for a much, much needed break.  Smoke 'em if ya got 'em.

Exhausted, but feeling good about it, our entire crew made their way out to the now (finally) empty playland.  We all sat down heavily, and sighed huge sighs of relief that the customers were gone, but we all knew we had at least an hour, if not 2, of closing clean up to deal with.  Yeah

As we sat there

""Why is there a child sleeping in Mayor McCheese?"" he asked

We all kind of stopped, around 7 or 8, was curled up in the fetal position inside the little jail cell.  He looked peaceful enough, but... where's mom or dad?

We all kind of looked at each other, while the rest of us checked out the windows and behind the bars of Playland to see if someone was around.  Nothing... not even a vehicle we couldn't account for (all the vehicles in lot belonged to the employees).

Well... what the ever-loving fuck are we supposed to do now?

Managers 1 and 2 returned and roused the child, at least, okay.

""I'm hungry.""  No problem on that front, a soda, and a Big Mac.  His eyes went wide and he began inhaling the food.  Not eating.  Oh... that's not good.  No one eats 30 minute old McDonald's food like that unless you really are starving.

The managers were good.  One peppered the child with questions, for the most part, got on with closing duties, and quite a lot of worry for the tyke.  Manager 2 called the police.

About 20 minutes later, didn't know where mommy went, was there a *long* time, didn't know mommy's first name, or a phone number to get in touch with her.  Oh fucking shit.  Most of us were in tears for this poor little... well, at this point, orphan.

We were all asked about the kid, very wrong about all that.  He agreed with the sentiment... but told me I probably wasn't at this point.

It's now nearly 1:30 AM.  I've finally got the inside restaurant done (including bathrooms), except for a few ""I hope he's gonna be okay,"" type comments, referring to the boy.  The police were still hanging around inside the restaurant with him, slowly, and politely asking him questions.  I don't think even they knew what to do at that point... Plus, hey

Out of nowhere, damn near catching air as they hit our ramp into our parking lot.  Tearing around the building, back onto the frontage road, then back into the lot again, to finally come to a halt at the door.  A woman jumped out, and started wrenching at the side door (that was locked), then pounding on it.  We couldn't be seen because of how dark it was in playland.

I stayed the hell out of the situation, that she'd punch me out with an extra 15 minutes **on top of** the the 14h30m I'd already worked that day (I trusted her, and she did keep her word on it), and just took off from the side gate of playland.

I got into work the next day, the highlights of which were:

* She'd dropped off her kid around 1PM with $5 for lunch.
* She'd then headed over to the casino ""for just a little while"".
* Was coming right back for him
* Not like she abandoned him or anything... after all

The job was similar to retail. Move customer's luggage from A to B. Walk the catering to the aircraft (we order

...except for lavatory duty. That was a nightmare.

To understand why, a mixture of water and caustic chemicals that eat organic material quickly. When you flush on an aircraft, it drains the bowl into the bottom of that tank of blue juice, then rinses the bowl with blue juice from top of the same tank. That's why it's heavily colored and scented - on long flights, that juice might circulate through 10 or 20 times, depending on how large the aircraft is.

When the plane lanes, open a service panel, dump the tank into a lavatory cart, and finally pump fresh juice back into the aircraft to top off the tank. It's important that this is done shortly after landing, especially in the summer. The longer it sits in the tank, the smellier it gets. It gets stinky exponentially faster when it's hot outside (magnified by the heat of the tarmac).

If all goes smoothly, it goes catastrophically wrong. Three things can happen:

* 1. You can fail to get the twist-lock connector on the dump port all the way. It will leak used juice all over you and the tarmac*. If it gets on your skin, the top layer of your skin will peel right off. If left on longer... I don't want to know what happens. To get it off the concrete, you have to use a Hazmat Cleanup kit to soak it up (neutralizing kitty litter), then pour on a mixture of bleach and hot water.
* 2. If the last person to dump the lavatory at the last airport didn't close the dump valve all the way, it starts to freeze where it drips out. It's very common to open the panel to access the dump port and have a 20# block of blue ice hit your boots.
* 3. Passengers on chartered or corporate jets love to throw non-organic items down the lavatory. Feminine products, etc. We've seen it all. Usually it clogs the system, refuses to drain or refill, and requires a maintenance crew to take it apart. The aircraft is grounded for several hours while this happens, and our crew was $125 per hour during the day (it took two technicians over an hour each).

Fast forward to Thanksgiving Eve*, and paying all the bills for the house. Money's tight and I can neither afford to buy one of those boxed nor take my fiancee out to a restaurant, and we don't have the time to cook it up ourselves. Hungry Man dinners, here we come. It's about 5pm, I'm at work, and our last scheduled corporate jet has just landed. They drop the passengers and request a ""quick turn"", which translates to, these guys work for a national chain that owns the aircraft -- they just fly it. The captain just flies it and the co-pilot does everything else in the cabin during cruise.

I'm stuck on lavatory duty for that aircraft. I pull my heavy little cart over, check the cart, check the fluid levels. Everything's fine. Try to dump again. Nothing. Meanwhile, the rest of my crew has dumped the trash bags, unloaded uneaten catering, emptied coffee tanks, emptied ice bins, charged for services

""Sorry

The kicker is the maintenance crews went home at 3pm for the holiday. They're $200/hr on call

Knowing this was probably a plugged toilet, pulled them over my arm up to my armpit and bunjee corded them above my bicep. I plunged my fingertips down the toilet, then my whole hand, and the next thing I knew I was up to my elbow. I managed to find the obstruction, grabbed it as hard as I could, and sat down and backwards to help pull my arm out. POP! Infant-size diaper in my hand, caustic fluid up to my bicep

I ended up in the employee restroom, he held it longer than a handshake normally lasts, gripped extra tight, and winked at me. I got the hint. When he let go my hand went straight to my pocket.

I marshalled the aircraft out to the runway, and dug into my pocket. Out came four $20 bills and I almost cried right there on the tarmac. Written across the top in marker, it read, ""Thank you for the most amazing"" and at the bottom, ""act of kindness we've ever seen."" The next one read at the top ""Please accept our most sincere thanks"" and at the bottom, ""and DO NOT POOL THIS TIP!"".

I have loads of these stories so if you want me to I can post more of them. I shall call this one The Chauvinistic Ceasar Salad.

I'm working on a tuesday evening during holiday season which meant that most citizens of that city are either out of town or home with their families. We probably had two or three customers in the restaurant so needless to say

In walks a couple in their 50's probably and seems like a pair of nice people, just smiles and genuinely seems friendly.

**Me:** Welcome to Fast-Food-Chain

**Mr.Salad:** I'll have a grilled chicken ceasar salad

**Mrs.Salad:** Yeah

**Me:** Thank you

The conversation proceeds with the regular back-n-forth and I proceed with bringing them the accessories, the other is still thawing and will take 4 (four) minuters before it's ready. I tell the couple this and they say it's no problem. Whenever someone says that waiting is ""no problem"" I always told them ""don't worry, I will bring it too you"" and sometimes give them free coffee (we were allowed to by the franchise management). The 4 (four) minutes pass and I bring the couple their salad.

At this point I remove this order from memory because it is completed. After probably 15-20 minutes I'm talking to another customer and Mrs.Salad comes up to the register. When I finish with the customer I turn to her who now has one customer behind her, never reacting angrily.

**Mrs.Salad:** No

**Me:** *slightly confused* I don't understand

**Mrs.Salad:** I think it is discriminating against women that my husband gets his food before I do.

**Me:** *even more confused* we... I... it's... I assure you that was not my intention and I'm sorry if you felt that way

**Mrs.Salad:** *interrupts* nonono

**Me:** Well

**Mrs.Salad:** No, but I just wanted to tell you that I think this is discriminating.

She then left with her husband waiting at the exit. The customer who had been standing behind her all the time was so dumb-founded he almost forgot where he were and what he wanted to order. I'm used to having these customers but he probably wasn't

Anyway, and like to think I'm a hard worker. I'll do just about anything to make a customer happy (as long as they're not rude to me), and will go over and above to make their day better.  

This story happened while working drive thru. In the mornings, and will sometimes just order that. No problem. As well, we have an automated machine that fills our cups with cream/sugar. Given the size of the drink, it will fill more cream/sugar (so, a single single in a large cup will physically have more cream and sugar than in a small cup)

You can probably get an idea of where this might be going

Sometimes, in a large, their cup is nearly 2/3 full of cream and sugar. I seriously kid you not. It's a pain for me, because I know I'll need to fill that cream machine again soon...  When a customer orders that, I sometimes feel like asking, 'Would you like any coffee with your cream today?'  I don't really judge, though, and would need to water it down that much as well. 

On to the actual story!

Customer comes through drive through, so when he comes to my window, I'm just making his coffee. He is therefore watching me make his coffee. 

So, there's a fill line on our cups for a number of reasons. One, there once was a lawsuit against my company because a woman scalded herself and got bad burns. Secondly, (I hope), so us employees don't burn ourself pouring it to the very top

So, and say have a great day!

Customer: Excuse me!  This isn't filled up all the way!
Me: Oh!  I'm sorry about that!  I thought I filled it up to the line

Pour a new cup (can't take anything back from a customer)

Customer: Did you put triple cream in this?  It tastes like it's way more!

I then explain the cup sizing

Customer: Well

Me: Okay then!  So

Customer: Yes (grumbling to his wife about incompetent workers)

As I'm now repouring his 3rd cup of coffee

I now hand it out again...

Customer: Thank God!  You'd think you people would know how to do coffee!

Me: I apologize about the inconvenience this has caused you sir. On the back of your receipt, and we would be happy to hear your comments

Customer: I would like to speak with a manager

At this point

Manager: Hi

Customer: I demand a free coupon!  This employee doesn't know how to make coffee

Manager: Actually

2 Weeks ago we had a woman enter our store with her daughter. I was in the back on a call

Up until ""The Incident""

I gave her her total, I had already went over the charges before hand. Looking back, I should have realized what she was getting at.

You see, and we have no say whatsoever about this. Given that she has been in our store before (Ill get to this), she most likely knew about it, which is why, after explaining the charges, she was suddenly so angry about them. Hindsight.

So anyway, so I proceed to list off her items. As soon as I get to the fee, it becomes deadly. She's furious. I explain, and my coworker too while she's helping other people, that it's a service fee charged to everyone. Its set by the owner, so we have to add it on. Blah blah. 

She then asks for the manager, and that rather than give it out to a customer, I can, again, have them call her. 

She takes her things and proceeds to go to the front of the store to complain to her husband and daughter who were waiting there about this. She leaves

10 Min later I get a call from our coworker at our other location, looking for the owner. Our coworker explained, again, that she could pass on the message. She then ranted to her about all the horrible ways we had treated her. At one point, our coworker asked her if she could help with her problem, and the lady replied, ""*Problem?* My **problem**?!"" Very angry.

After we had our talk about this and fluffed it off we sent a message to the owner (Who was out of the country for a week). after looking at past transactions we realized that *she had been in here before!* About a year ago, so after doing some research in our system, concluded that it must have been a former employee who incurred her wrath. So obviously, this is not the first time she has been in raising hell.

A week ago, basically listing all the fictional ways she had been wronged in our store the week before: From ignoring her and her family, to rolling eyes, to rude comments...none of which happened. As I said, until the transaction ended, she was pleasant enough. I replied and stated the facts and basically told the owner that I honestly believe, based on this and past events, and she was just trying to cause a fuss. No word back yet.

*....But ohhhhhh Im so angry!* She basically lied in a gigantic letter about us, but it still infuriates me to no end to think that this woman has that much time on her hands to do that. I know pissing me off is probably exactly what she was after, but I can't help it. Any ideas to shrug off the bad mojo?

As a broke university student


Before the first Wednesday night, and for whatever reason, ALL of the registers in the stores in our province used the same key. (Brilliant, I know.) So they'd been hitting up stores a few hours away from us, and moving progressively closer.


Now, the cashier would leave the cash, the other two would open the drawers, take the money, and they would all run. 


The first Wednesday night I worked, no matter what. Now, I was thinking there was no WAY these guys would try it again. They literally got chased out of the store in the next town over, so clearly we were onto them. We had their descriptions. But obviously better safe than sorry, I followed my manager's instructions. 


And… nothing happened. It was super boring.


Cue Wednesday #2. Same instructions. I was also given the cell phone number of a mall security guard who knew the situation. Out of curiosity


Then about halfway through my shift, I smile and greet him. He smiles back, goes around my counter and looks at something next to me. 


I turn my head; there are two other guys


My heart sinks and then immediately jumps into my throat. *HOLY SHIT


The first guy asks me, far away from the cash. So I break our usual policy, and very politely (still smiling!) direct him to it. The ONLY thing running through my mind at this point is *NOPE. NOT LEAVING. I'M NOT LEAVING THIS CASH. I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE. I'M NOT LEAVING…*


First guy starts walking hesitantly over where I directed. ""Over here?"" he asks.


""Yep! Right there on the back wall."" *NOPE


First guy


""Oh, NOT LEAVING, NOT LEAVING…*


First guy reaches the back wall, I grab my phone, and dial the number I was given. I look up, the three guys are having a little conference, and looking at me. 


*BEEP! I'm sorry. The number you have dialed is not in service.*


I curse the phone


*BEEP! I'm sorry. The number you have dialed is not in service.*


I try a third time, and the guys are gone. 


*Well


My heart is still pounding, but I'm searching around for the regular mall security number, and I can't freaking find it. So I end up calling the girl at the jewelry stand outside my store, waving at her, and asking if she has the mall security number. FINALLY get through to security, and about 3 mins later, Mr. Should-have-answered-his-cellphone comes RUNNING up (apparently he was in the process of getting his phone fixed when I called).


""Which way'd they go?!?!""


Me: ""Well


He takes off anyway. He comes back shortly, btw. I could hardly remember anything. *Did they have facial hair?* I think so... *Was he wearing a hat?* Yes! *What kind?* Uh...)


Anyway, I stay to finish the rest of my shift by myself.


About 30 mins later, ""Don't worry, I won't let anyone steal anything."" *If you only knew...*


The rest of the night went fine. I never worked another Wednesday night. We never got another security alert. I sure showed them.

- High level store management is hugely incompetent
- 3 ""Extreme"" Couponers

Background: Currently I am the cashier manager at an indepedent Canadian grocery store chain (we are technically owned by a big chain, and next week to work on finishing my masters thesis (computer science), which is due on the ~20th~. 

Today: At 8:30am, i slept through his calls during the night, which i found out later), hasn't shown up at all, and she isn't answering her phone. Fuck. So the tills are locked, and we open at 9am, the acting store manager at the time also apparently has no fucking idea how to open the safe (fucking useless), i refuse (i would get fired if someone found out). 

So I drag my ass to work, and people are not happy that nobody can checkout their purchases). We are also apparently quite short handed, since it was basically me/two newer employees. 

Fuck. We are missing 2 cashiers and a supervisor. Supervisor no answer

Me: ""Where are you?""
Asshat: ""Its not a real job
Me: ""Can you just come in for one last shift for a little while? We are understaffed badly
Asshat: ""Already threw it away

Basically i spent the next three hours dancing between the phone and the POS (checkout), when i told them i was the manager they kind of realized how messed up the situation was, i hope). Sadly no one is willing to come, or i can get in touch with them. Thankfully there is two people starting around ~noon~. However before this i ran into the first extreme couponer of the day.

---
Foreword: At the store i work at

Also thanks to shows like extreme couponing people immediately went ""i can do that do""

---
Stuff quieted down a bit (the time between the morning rush, and i am trying to get people to show up early):

The lady and her posse (the 4 hags), toothpaste, and some other stuff. The 4 hags wanted it split like this:

They each wanted each product split 4 ways

DO NOT EVER FUCKING DO THIS

They basically cleared the shelves from what it seemed. However the new girl started trying to process their order, she looks like she got ripped apart.

I void the whole order

Me: ""Show me the coupons you are going to be using before we start scanning the products""
4 Hags: ""No after you scan and divide up the products""

IF YOU ARE A CASHIER AND A COUPONER DOES THIS TO YOU
- Basically they want to piss you off enough with their extremely difficult and complex order so you will get frustrated and just accept whatever coupons they give you so they can get you the hell out of there. 
- Typically they won't scan, or they might just not have a barcode
- They will try and rush you along and try and get you to hurry up

I've seen this before, finally they show me their hand of 11 coupons:
- 5 internet coupons that fail to meet any sort of minimum criteria for an internet coupon basically if they are making money back after applying a coupon to a product not on sale
- 1 pad of coupons that has obviously been ripped off something. 
- 3 Coupons state they cannot be applied to any other promotional offer (the product was on sale)
- 2 of them having ""One per customer in fine print""

I refuse to accept any of them since they treated her like shit, form god damn it.

Finally reinforcements of two more cashiers show up, i take over. All valid coupons! It takes almost 25 minutes to get her checked out (she had a lot but saved overall ~80% of her costs). Except... 

The price doesn't match what her stupid fucking ipad says. Shes one of those. There is a 1% chance the computer screwed something up, thats not good enough, she shows me that according to her ipad spreadsheet she her final cost should be under 50 bucks. However its almost triple that. I check and check again, computer seems right. 

DONT EVER TELL A COUPONER HER HOLY IPAD SPREADSHEET APP IS WRONG

I hate these people, i was tired. She kept going over the print out. Then a breakthrough:

Her: ""Theres something definately wrong lets restart from the beginning""
Me: ""Mam there is nothing wrong with the POS everything is right
Her: ""NO MY IPAD IS NOT WRONG
Me: *Points to Manager Tag On my Shirt*
Her: ""GIVE ME THE NUMBER FOR YOUR STORE MANAGER YOU ARE RUNNING A SCAM HERE"" 
Me: ""Mam
Her: ""Starts going over the bill

Finally a lightbulb went off somewhere
Her: ""Oops
Me: ""Alright your total will be ~160$""
Her: ""No i don't want it

No apologies no nothing

Yes

About halfway through, *Really? If that was the problem you could have said something.* I would have understood if she had told me she was having back trouble and took the stuff out of the basket, that's not as big of a deal to me as someone just being blatantly lazy. I can't read minds.
After scanning and sacking about two bags worth of cans

""Ma'am

""Well

At this point I'm so furious I'm shaking
""What about those first bags? You aren't going to fix those?!""

I'm still shaking

""Where's my 16 cents?""

""Excuse me?""

""That gift card was the same as a $100 bill

""Ma'am

""You're telling me I can't get my change back?!""

""I can't give change unless you use cash.""

She huffs and I call for the carry out she so ""kindly"" requested
Sometime later the manager comes back by and I asked him if she said anything on the way out. Apparently she decided to inform him that the cashier that waited on her was a stupid b**ch and she didn't appreciate how they didn't stack the cans like she wanted. He said at that point he stopped talking to her and shoved the stuff in her car. I've been at my job for a while

So I’m at the children’s reference desk with another librarian, shit is bustling.  I’m directing patrons to the latest Dora DVDs, pushing Roald Dahl at every opportunity, teaching people how to use their iPads and Kindles, and helping over-eager parents find study guides to the elementary-level aptitude tests that no one is supposed to study for, per usual.  

This kid of about nine or ten comes up to the desk, the 200’s house pretty much anything that falls under the topic of religion – this includes modern monotheistic religions as well as ancient ones.   We find a book he likes – Greek mythology illustrated as an action comic book.  He seems happy and toodles off on his way.

I’m called away from the desk, “Crazy guy, I’ll tell you later, I think he’s still here.”

From across the library, and there’s Greek-mythology-kid pointing at me.  His dad is standing next to him, and his dad is a really big guy.  He looks pissed.  I’m a tall enough woman that most men don’t tower over me, but this guy is just intimidatingly large.  He marches up to me with the kid trotting in his wake, and slaps his hand down on the desk, making a loud THUMP that gets the attention of several people nearby.   Krissy and I have already put on our stone-faces – you know, the one that every service/retail person perfects to defend against members of the public afflicted with Crazy Face.

**AngryDad:** WHERE IS THAT BOOK?

**Me:** Pardon?  (I should point out that while I’m keeping my cool, which is something I’ve done several dozen times already today, to no adverse result.)

**Krissy:** The book you gave me?  It’s there on the red reshelving cart behind you.

AngryDad turns around

**AngryDad:**  WHAT IS THIS? HOW CAN YOU CALL THIS NON-FICTION?

At this point, factual, literary, whatever.  That’s unfortunate, since lots of boys wind up responding more readily to graphic novels and huge exploded illustrations of machines than, say, Anne of Green Gables

**Me:** Oh

**AngryDad:** YEAH.  MYTHS.  HOW AM I GOING TO EXPLAIN TO MY SON WHY THESE MYTHS ARE IN THE NONFICTION SECTION NEXT TO THE CHRISTIANITY BOOKS?

Oh.  I get it.  This is one of those people.  We’re in an affluent, and are not shy about making sure you know what is and is not moral or appropriate.  It’s also, apparently, the kind of place where some people think that the only religious books that should be classified as non-fiction in the DEWEY DECIMAL SYSTEM, in a PUBLIC LIBRARY no less, are religious books about Christianity.  Great.  I realize that I should probably expect this kind of thing, or at least not be surprised by it.  I drop my Friendly Children’s Librarian Demeanor and use my very best Unwaveringly Stern Voice.

**Me:** In the Dewey Decimal System

**AngryDad:** BUT YOU JUST SAID THEY’RE MYTHS.  AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL MY SON THESE STORIES ARE REAL?

**Kid:** Yeah Dad, and I guess there’s something about getting to push your parents’ buttons in a way that directs their hostility onto someone else that’s in some way satisfying or exciting.)

**AngryDad:** SEE?! 

**Me:** In the Dewey Decimal System

**AngryDad:** BUT – 

**Me:** Greek mythology was a religion

A gentleman (in the rage of 50-60 years old) mosied up to the service desk today with a cart full of molding that is sold by the foot/inch to check out and announces that he has X amount of boards at exactly X length.

I apologize and inform him that because they are sold by the foot

To which he says 'Do what you need to do.'

So, but this began a tirade that would continue throughout this whole transaction. He keeps getting up in my face and moving things around on his cart intentionally and making this whole process take about three times longer than it normally would.

'I can't believe you have to do this' 
'This is why people go to your competitor'
'You're worthless and wasting my time.'

And now in my head I'm like whatever. Enjoy your temper tantrum. So it continues with his yelling and general berating and really nothing I haven't heard before.

'I've never had anyone do this to me before'
'What do you mean that one is X feet X inches! It was in your X foot bin!' (That bin that has pieces between X feet and X feet 11 inches? Okay.)
'I'll never shop here again'
'Can't you see? They're obviously all the same'
'I think you should be giving me money for wasting my time'

I stop right before I measure the last piece. 'Sir. These are literally sold by the inch

So he shuts up for a tick

Then starts again about how it's a bullshit policy and that I'm clearly lying to him and he wants a supervisor.

So

So

This guy apologizes to her and says a couple choice phrases about how awful this policy is. And we all think this is the end of it.

BUT THEN he turns

Eventually he leaves. Manager and I are dumbfounded. And after a little bit she looks at me and goes 'Did he just yell at you for letting him yell at you?'

Then we both died laughing.

*Please note that the whole yelling thing is an everyday occurrence for us and she didn't help me because normally people just want to be assholes and I usually don't have a problem de-escalating or getting a supervisor when the situation becomes too much and has nothing to do with her being a bad person or whathaveyou.

Thinking about it I have zero recollection of him making that request. If he made it

So, being naturally defensive of anything good that I create, was getting irritated and angry. I said, ""You know what, I'll get my supervisor and she can give you a refund.""

It was about 8:45pm on a Saturday (when our store shuts at 9pm) and he'd just finished cleaning the entire Deli, because it would be a waste.

This older woman comes in, goes and lingers around the deli cabinet before wandering off to look at pre-sliced and packaged stuff a metre or so away. T goes back to cleaning and covering the deli meats up (usual end of night protocol) at the other end of the deli.

She coughs, and asks her what he can help her with. 

'I want some prosciutto.' the woman says, prosciutto is sliced extremely thin. I think it's Italian but I'm not sure, nice stuff though.
'Did you hear me? I said I wanted prosciutto.' 'Okay then, but I don't want that one there. It's too thick. I'm going to go do the rest of my shopping, and I want you to cut some up for me even thinner when I'm gone.'

First of all, T just goes 'No. The slicer's already been cleaned for the night, I don't slice past 6pm, you can have that prosciutto in the case and that's it.' Point I forgot to make, there's already a lot of cut up prosciutto in the cabinet.

* Older lady: 'So you're saying that the slicer's broken?'
* T: 'No
* Older lady: 'But that's too thick
* T: 'I didn't say the slicer was broken! The store is about to close
* Older lady: 'So what I'm hearing is that you're refusing to cut me some prosciutto.'
* T: 'That's exactly what I'm saying! I am not cutting anything up. You can have that stuff and that's it.' 

At this point he's almost shaking mad

It's now 9pm, over the speaker and goes back to cleaning while the woman taps her fingers on the glass cabinet and tells him, 'If you'd just cut the prosciutto up I wouldn't have to do this you know, now I'm going to tell your boss you should be fired for being so disrespectful and not listening to customer.'

K walks over  - he's a pretty big black guy, asking T what the problem is, but the woman cuts in.

'He told me that the slicer is broken but how can it be when there's already so much sliced meat!?'
K and T just look at one another, there's already thin sliced prosciutto there, and the slicer's already been cleaned for the night and I don't want to have to re-clean it for the one thing.'

K looks at the woman, by the way. 'Well, Ma'am,' says K, crossing his arms and staring at her, 'I'm going to have to ask you to leave there store. Without the prosciutto. We've been shut for ten minutes, and we'd all like to go home.'

'BUT YOU HAVE TO SERVE ME AND I WANT PROSCIUTTO CUT FOR ME!' Older woman starts screaming. K just tells her to get out

One Saturday he came in informing us that he needed a chainsaw, oil, gas and wrench, so that he shouldn't have any reason to call us. I fired it up for him, showed him how it worked and how to tighten the chain, and sent him on his way. 

A few hours later, I set the saw up on the counter and begin the process of replacing the chain. I take my time showing him how to replace the chain himself in case he has another issue, and I happily offer to top off his fluids and send him back out. I punch out for lunch, and I leave for the hour.

When I return, since they must be in my pocket because he couldn't find them anywhere(and for the record, they weren't). I was instantly irate. I had taken his shitty attitude for months, and I was done with it. If there's one thing I will not tolerate, it's people calling me a liar or a fuck-up. I had done the procedure of replacing those chains nearly a hundred times, and because I know how dangerous it could be to make a mistake, I knew to always make sure that the nuts were tight before I leave the saw. This, made me firmly believe that his guy was lying out his ass. I also had an Ace up my sleeve. The spot that I had chosen to work on his saw

1373547328.0,1i2s21,Pizza Delivery,HulkHogansPastamania,383,82,45,"Here's a couple stories of my days as a pizza guy

#1
So I've got about an hour left on my shift and didn't feel like driving all over so I agree to take the motel order and then come back and fold boxes. I get to the motel and realize I'm delivering to the room on the corner of the first floor, hopping up and down on one leg while the other has blood pouring down it onto the carpet. As calmly as I could I tell the guy to close the door and get decent, he comes back with pants on this time, I get a $3 tip and a story.

#2
There was a gated community just down the street from us and for some reason they refused to give us a remote for the front gate, a few seconds later I'm greeted by this beautiful woman (early 20's brunette lowcut top) who takes the food and drinks and sets them on a table next to the front door, she comes back and starts making small talk/flirting (awe yeah, everyone loves the pizza guy) then grandma no bra with the see thru blouse comes to the door screaming how she never buzzed me in, tosses the money at me and slams the door. On the bright side she actually threw enough money at me to where I still got tipped.
#3
I'd been delivering about 3 months at this point and hadn't experienced crazy customers yet. So it's my first delivery of the day and it's in a nice part of town, walk over and lean into the car and grab a dime and as soon as I turn around the guy is right in my face demanding his change, I hand him the dime and leave. When I got back to the store I told my manager who showed me how to leave comments about the customers so other drivers knew what to expect.
#4
So it's about 8 PM on a thursday night and I'd sent out to deliver to customer who'd complained about every order they'd received from us. They'd say that we'd given them the wrong order, since theirs was the only delivery I had I went straight back to the store. I see my manager is fuming, apparently everything was wrong and tastes horrible, so my manager remakes the exact order and sends me back but not before telling me that no matter what this customer is banned. So I put the pizzas into the heating bag and head back into the night. I made sure to park to where they couldn't see me coming, got out and grabbed the heating bag, made sure that it was secured tightly and started throwing it around, I did this for a solid minute and then I walked the order up to the house. They called and complained and for once they were right but they cried wolf too many times.
#5
Had a really bad shift culminating in my last hour driving to opposite sides of our delivery area and not getting tipped. I'd been saving my delivery tags (not sure what they were actually called) for the last couple weeks, I told him that we're going to start prank calling all of the rude no tipping dicks. We'd come up with the idea that we were talk radio hosts from Maine and we were calling random people through out the U.S. to see if they could answer our $10,000 question. We figured that since we were from Maine that it had to be a Stephen King related question, something easy and well known like which state were most of his stories based in or around? We waited until 2-3 AM one weeknight and started calling, at first they'd be all grumpy but once the idea of $10,000 was mentioned they perked right up like obedient little dogs. By the time I quit we'd called roughly 60 customers, some of them on more than one occasion. 
#666
I'd started collecting my orders when I noticed that I had no idea where one of the deliveries was going, grab the food and drinks and step out into the waist high grass. I'd almost made it to the front door when I noticed a little girl come walking out from the grass, she asked me what I was doing and I told her I was delivering pizza to whoever lived here to which I turn and point to the house and in the split second it took me to make that motion and turn back to face her she's managed to disappear. I didn't hear any childish laughter or sounds of playing just birds returning to their nests, I walked up to the front door and knocked, several seconds later an elderly woman opened the door and paid me. I turned and ran back to my car and hauled ass out of there, as I was backing down the dirt drive way I noticed a candle burning in one of the second floor windows.

Her: ""HEEEELLLLOOOO?! I've been waiting here forever. Is anyone going to do this shit?""

Me: ""Sorry Ma'am

Her: ""I want my money back if I have to wait another 10 god damn minutes""

Already annoyed by this bitch, and let the other customer service associate know that I will be back in 5 minutes or less.

I grab the grill and wheel it outside. What am I loading this grill in to? A Jeep Wrangler. I have to load a 3 burner grill into a Jeep... There's no way it would fit as is

5 minutes go by. I have another 15 minutes or so left in my shift and this grill is still not in the back of her 2lb Jeep Wrangler.

Daughter: ""Can't you just like angle it in? I just need to get this door shut a little bit and we can drive without worrying about it falling out""

That's not a bad idea

I start stripping the other side panel

Once I get it off

Daughter: ""That's not going to fit. Can you just hurry up and put all this shit back together? I came here to buy a grill

Me: ""Oh

Hag: ""Just fucking put it together. We're going to pay the $65 for delivery. I'm never fucking doing this again""

Store Policy states that we are not allowed to accept cash tips. I let them know that as she started pulling out money which turns out was for the delivery fee (Yes.. she really thought that she could just give me the money in person and get it delivered.)

Honest mistake on my part by thinking it was a tip for me. As a front loader

She takes the screws and washers that she was keeping in her purse and throws them on the ground. Takes $2 out of her purse and drops it in a puddle.

Bitchy McCuntaHag: ""Here's yah fuckin tip""

I wheeled the grill and it's side panels into the store and waited for them to leave before I started putting it back together.

Half an hour went by before they finally left. I'm punching out late. If it wasn't for my amazing ability to not flip out on customers during their worst; Someone would be out of a job and the other in the emergency room.

**The Legend of the Exploding X-Box**

I worked at several stores, their assistant was sick in the hospital, and their third keyholder had gotten in a car wreck- no one was available to open the store.  I agreed to work all day, because yay overtime.  I met the district manager at the store 5 minutes after open, expecting an angry customer since we weren't open yet- but nope, all good.  My DM even helped with opening, which wasn't something he normally did- I could tell he was thankful I came in.  I settled in and looked around the store, Gamecube and PS2s in fiberglass boxes on the shelf next to the register.  I turned them on as I got ready for the day.

About two hours later, and I was showing her how to use the register.  Only one customer was in the store, and he was playing the NBA demo on the XBox 360.  All of a sudden, he yells out, and I look over.  The XBox is emitting clouds of white smoke.  I ask Jane where the keys were to open the demos, and of course she doesn't know.  I call our DM as I'm opening the front door, and he doesn't answer.  I run to my car, and using it and a paper clip, we didn't sell a single X-Box that day.


**Trade-In Troubles**

One of the most common complaints we received were the low trade in offers we gave.  I was usually pretty good at handling these customers, I was able to deflect the complaint by pointing out that we took in almost all games that we still carried, even if we had hundreds of copies of it.  That Madden football game from 4 years ago is worth a dime to us because we have 40 copies in the back, and no one is buying one that old anyway.  

Anyways, and he's thrilled- he wants an X-Box 360.  Our system had a limit of 50 items that could be traded at once, so I grouped everything together in stacks of 48, since we had a ""trade in 3 games, get $10"" special going for all games valued over $2.  I had three full stacks of games I thought were worth more than $2, one not-so-full stack of games I knew were worth less, and then the hardware and controllers.  Instead of using both registers to run the trades, and started browsing the X-Box 360 wall, so it'll apply the promotion, and I explain the issue.  I then start ringing the trade on the good register while the other one is booting up.  Same thing happens- register freezes.  The customer starts tapping his toes and acting a little perturbed

RAGER-  WHAT IS THE DAMN HOLDUP?!?!

Me-  The registers couldn't handle all the games at once

RAGER-  I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE NOT DONE!  WHAT THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?  WHERE'S YOUR MANAGER?

At this point, and we'll be ringing him up in just a few minutes.

RAGER-  FORGET THAT

I sit there with my mouth open for a minute, some of which have been processed through in trade and some haven't.  I proceed to void out the previous transactions as he's yelling and screaming.  As he's leaving the store with his box of goodies, he screams ""THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS FUCKING RIGHT!"", to which I yell back ""EXCEPT WHEN THEY'RE A DUMBASS!"".


**Corporate Craziness**

Anyone that's worked for a retail corporation can tell you- it sucks, other employees would use the scripted ""Is there anything you'd like to preorder"" or ""Hey, the new Halo is coming out!  Do you want to reserve it for $5?"".  I always felt it best to open conversation with the customer and determine if the sales opportunity was there.

One beautiful Tuesday, and we'd get last minute people to come in and preorder the game coming out tomorrow.  I had done 8 preorders by noon on just 6 transactions, so my percentages (company wanted 10%) were sitting at 133%.  I had also sold two of our discount cards, so my percentage on that was 33%.  At noon, when I'm processing that day's deliveries, our district manager comes in for a surprise checkup.  I was pretty cordial with him at that time, and we chatted as he looked around and I processed things.  A few customers came in, I chatted them up and rang them out, I turned around and saw a somewhat angry look on our DM's face.

DM- ""Are you happy giving away sales opportunities?""

Me- ""Umm

DM- ""You didn't mention preorders

I proceeded to bring up the day's sales report, showing me at 21% and 12% for the month.  He never mentioned numbers to me again.


I'm out of retail now, they are hearing ""The customer is always right!"" from a customer and ""you're missing opportunities"" from corporate.

When you work in specialty retail, or their voice.  Not Antony.  No, you recognized Antony because he was HUGE.  Not in the fat slob kind of way, but in the ultimate definition of ""Big Russian Bear"" kind of way.  Easily 6'10"" and 400 pounds of solid muscle, and I'm not exaggerating.  I'm 6'2"" and 220, and the man TOWERED over me.  It was like trying to do business with a garbage truck.  The fact that his massive paws somehow managed to play Mandolin (and quite well, I might ad) just made the visual that much more comical.

Now, was also loud, bold, brash, and ugly.  I'm not saying he had an ugly personality, quite the opposite in fact.  No, I'm saying his face looked like some very brave soul had used it for kicking practice.  A hideous scar ran across his right eyebrow, quite obviously

Thing is, larger-than-life kind of character who makes things interesting.  His thick Russian accent and propensity for wearing massive leather bomber jackets just made the effect better.  It was as if someone had taken every major Russian soldier and/or mob character from every movie in the last 20 years, rolled them up in a carpet, beat them with tire irons so they mushed into one person, and then set it loose to scare the villagers.  Always had a smile when Antony shouldered his way through the doors.  (His story is pretty awesome as well, but it would make this post far too long, I'll write it in the comments)

Anyway, egos and attitudes abound in music, and Todd was REALLY not interested in hearing what some 19-year-old with spiky hair and a club shirt embroidered with flames had to say (didn't matter than I knew about 5 times what he did, and his knowledge was 20 years out of date).  He was ranting and raving at me, and starting to make a bit of a scene.

In walks Antony.  He instantly sees this burnt-out ex-rocker (who really should put down the guitar and pick up a can of Ensure) chewing me out

""You are yelling at my friend.  There is problem?  Why are you yelling at my friend?""

And then Antony smiled.  Not a friendly

Now, of events, even of stuff that doesn't actually exist.  But the way that Todd went from full bluster to a quivering, pale, meek little mouse of a man was so instantaneous I thought for a moment Antony may have access to some weird Russian teleportation technology and had just swapped Todd with a clone from somewhere in Siberia.

Todd pulled back like a cobra had just latched on to him, ""I do not think he will be problem anymore.  You have bronze Mandolin strings for me, yes?""  And I laughed, I laughed very hard.  So did Antony.  Other customers looked over at us nervously, because if there is anything scarier than a big Russian laughing, it's a big Russian when he stops laughing, and they all wanted to know when to duck.  Todd was never seen again

* #1. In the original post, ""As of today (Friday, 25 January) - the police arrested the three boys, they pleaded not guilty, and we're going to court.""

And then on February 5th he posts that the week long trial is already finished, January 29th, but either way, it would not have been in trial 3 or 4 days after the arrest date. This alone indicates fake.

* #2. Where I am

A much more likely set of events is that you are arrested and you go before a Judge for preliminary proceedings (aka first appearance court for adults or detention hearings for juveniles). This is supposed to happen within 24 hours of your arrest. Bond is set or you are released and you are given a new court date. At that new court date, you have your 
arraignment. There, arraignment is reset for yet another court date a couple weeks later.

Once you've entered your plea, this would be set out far enough that both sides would have time to do subpoenas, etc. Often the lawyers want another date in the interim (a status conference or disposition date) so that they have time to do depositions with witnesses, gather evidence, etc, before they decide if they want to go to trial. But we are talking about trial most likely set out a couple months after the date of arrest.

The only reason a case would go to trial in 3 to 4 days was if the case was running into speedy trial issues and the defense did not want to waive speedy trial. But again

* #3. A week long trial, but exceedingly unlikely for misdemeanors. Likely fake.

* #4. u/PardayTarday talks about how he was a witness and what the other witnesses testified to. Even the most inexperienced defense lawyer would invoke the Rule of Sequestration, but he would not have been in the court room. Fake.

* #5. He talks about people from ""Sprawl Mart"" testifying. Unless they had been in the store and witnessed the event, if he/she wanted to. Fake.

* #6. The charges: ""found guilty of these charges: 1) Indecent Exposure 2) Property Damage 3) Simple Assault."" Property Damage isn't a charge. It would be something like Criminal Mischief and a degree. Example

* #7. The sentence, but not jail, unless they were tried as adults. Again, unlikely for these charges. Fake.

* #8. The community service hours. You aren't sentenced to do community service when you are placed in jail. How can you do community service when you are locked up? Community service hours are only given to people who are put on probation. If it was something like 10 days of jail and then probation with community service

* #9. The crazy mom was supposedly removed and never seen again. If you are a junvenile, which is basically another attorney volunteering their time to watch out for the juvenile's best interests, in lieu of a parent. Likely fake.

* #10. He talks about how ""Corporate began within the first two days showing their evidence"" and ""On Wednesday

A bunch of other parts of this story just seem wrong as well.

We were one of the more popular stores so it was rare that we weren't busy and it was nice because it made the days go fast even though I loved my job.

It was one of the rare moments during the week in the school season that we hardly had anyone in the store.  I was doing my rounds

Fast forward about an hour and this stocky man in a leather jacket comes up to the register.  I ask him what I could help him with and he tells me that when his family got home they realized their daughter didn't have her wallet so he came back to ask in every store if they had found one.  The right thing to do is to ask the person what the wallet looked like BEFORE saying that one was found.  He described it

Wrong.  The next day I walk in for an evening shift and my manager tells me that a woman, what a coincidence, it fits the description of the boyfriend that came in with the woman and daughter.

We threw around ideas of what to do.  Should we call the police?  No, or their phone numbers so that wouldn't work.  So we just figured that it was out of our hands because I did  the right thing.

A few days later I come in and there is a police officer at our counter (not a mall cop).  Not unusual because they like to come in on their breaks once in a while to buy a few things since they patrol the area around the mall pretty often.  But he wasn't on break

He got a call from a very angry woman a couple days ago telling him that the woman at the music store stole her 5-year-old's wallet.  She gave him my name and even a description.  This made everything on my side even better because my manager didn't give the woman my name when she came him with her boyfriend and daughter.  He just told her no wallet was found and that was that.

The officer and I went to the back room to talk about what happened.  He agreed that the whole thing just made no sense.  And we even wondered who would let their kid that young carry around that much money without worrying about them misplacing it?  He told me that I wasn't in trouble and I did what I was supposed to do.  The woman was going to be called back and explained what I told him.
I wish I knew what happened after he left.  That was the last I heard of it all and I never saw the couple and daughter again.

So if you've happened upon my other stories you already know that I spent about five years working at a kids play place/pizza restaurant/arcade that was not a national chain but a *lot* like it. Mostly it was awesome, just some sweet sweet justice. 

So on the weekends

So they head out to the game floor and I go about my business of helping other kids redeem tickets. About fifteen minutes later, and it was impossible that they'd won that many in such a short amount of time. 

I'm the first one behind the counter free, just like we fold them to get them inside the games. Then I notice that they're missing the small bumps that every game on the floor punches into tickets as they are dispensed. These tickets are smooth as could be, meaning that a game didn't spit them out as winnings and that somewhere, a game cabinet was empty. 

I discreetly send a coworker out to check the game floor

Now, huge high-quality stuffed animals, board game sets, and so on. We even had some electronics. They cost a bajillion tickets because they were much more expensive to buy than the shitty sunglasses and such that were 25 tickets or what have you. An these kids were *definitely* old enough to understand that stealing something like that from Wal-Mart or somewhere would land them in trouble. But here they were, using stolen tickets to try and scam us out of an expensive prize. 

Anyway, but they can't use the tickets they just brought up. 

Douche 1: We won those. You *have* to use them.

Me: Okay

D 1: Uhhh...

D 2:  The one where you hit the moles with the rubber hammer thing. 

Me: Guys

I proceed to explain about the bumps and how we found an empty cabinet

""HEY. Stop right there
 
This damn voice was commanding; it stops those kids dead in their tracks. A dad who'd been standing near them during our exchange was marching towards them

Finally things settled down and the dad came back to finish helping his daughter pick out prizes. I said

For some reason, I was internally livid with this person, and I guess I never shook it off.

This little rant of mine is practically a how to guide of successfully wiping someone's ass

Those of you working a retail location with a lottery machine will understand the stress of performing such transactions.  This transaction, or ""Tuesday's drawing"", nor is it ""The One for a Buck.""  

This has everything to do with manners.

Customer comes up while talking on his bluetooth, word for word, for a ""quick pick power play.""  Fantastic, someone knows what it's called, and I don't have to list off the other 4 games that are drawing that evening.

I said ""sure thing.""  Printing his ticket and walking back to the register, is usually never in arms reach, and I must retrieve it.

""That will be $2.""  He hands me a $20.  I ring it through and count his change back to him and i turn the bills so he can grab them with ease.  I then thanked him for stopping in

Confused, the ticket is on his side of the counter, literally 3 inches away from his hand.

""You are clearly new at this

Without missing a beat, grabbing a plastic bag on my way and push the receipt button on my register.  I place both the player sleeve with the lottery ticket, and the receipt into the bag and ask if he would like me to walk it out to the car for him.

He snatches it out of my hand and storms out

(kinda NSFW, and long)",Lydious,352,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1adz9y/just_one_of_my_many_bosses_from_hell_kinda_nsfw/, but I began to notice little red flags here &amp; there. After a week he started making me park half a mile away in the ""employee parking"" at the end of the strip mall while he himself continued to park right in front of the store(didn't give me an explanation why either). There was one other girl that worked there

One of my training questions when I first started was along the lines of ""what kind of phone should you sell to a senior citizen?"". I answered sensibly that I would probably set them up with something basic &amp; easy to use, yet he refused to actually work with the customer's needs in order to reduce returns(and of course, he constantly bitched about money). 

He was so anti-customer it wasn't even funny. People that came in that didn't spend much money or sign new contracts were all but told to leave. One guy came in with a defective battery, he declined &amp; said he had an old phone at home he could use instead. I suggested that he look on ebay to find it cheaper, and he was delighted with that suggestion &amp; I felt good for actually helping someone. But then I got chewed out for ""losing a sale"". Gee, just trying to help someone but fuck me, right?!

He was one of the greediest people I've ever met. He marked up the accessories through the roof

There was more general stupidity, and talk about how his ex-girlfriends would give him head in public. Uhh, didn't need to hear about that, but good for you...? One day when the male employee walked in, out of absolutely NOWHERE the boss blurted out, ""Hey so &amp; so, you should go eat her out cause she's sexually frustrated!""

This was a casual work environment, but this was an independent shop, owned completely by the boss &amp; his father. I knew if I went to his father he'd undoubtedly take his son's side so I didn't even bother, plus I didn't like the idea of talking about such things to a humorless, 60-something, ultra-conservative Muslim man. Not that he was a mean guy or anything, but it would have been horrifyingly uncomfortable. 

The final straw came one night when he &amp; I were the only ones in the store. He came waddling out from the back &amp; informed me that I would be in charge of the store for a couple hours because he had to go take a shower &amp; get ready for a ""meeting"" (which was actually a **date** that he had made with one of the female customers a few days earlier). OK fine

He left around 4, no alarm codes, no way to lock up or secure the place  whatsoever. He wasn't answering his phone either. Did he expect me to just hang out there all night?! There was literally a line of angry people all demanding to speak to someone in charge(DoucheBoss had left me alone with almost no stock of phones on the ONE night when everybody wanted a new phone &amp; I had none to sell), and I was panicking &amp; near tears by the end of the night. I had been there only *three weeks* at that point. 

I ended up calling the other girl that worked there and thankfully she had keys &amp; could come rescue me. She arrived shortly, and told her to tell Asshole that he would never see me again in his lifetime. 

It felt so damn good to walk out &amp; leave that assmunch hanging. This happened on a friday night

At the time of the incident

So I call a manager to ask about the coupon and she says she doesn't know what I am talking about. She and another manager come upstairs to my department to find out what is going on. I explain to them that we had a coupon specifically for the children's department because there was an error in the system. The two managers proceed to argue with me and tell me that I am wrong. So I pointed out all of the signs in the department that say the customer gets an extra percentage off for using their card and ask if I need to take the signs down if that's not true. 

The whole time

My department manager and her new assistant come upstairs at this time and are trying to figure out what is going on. I explain it to them and then its the managers battling it out while I finish up the transaction. The whole time I've kept my cool and the customers tell me that I handled the whole thing really well and said they were sorry I had to deal with those managers. 

After they left, they left and went back downstairs. 
Victory was mine. 

My manager immediately goes to the store manager and I am called in to tell him my side of the story. Both managers were written up and wouldn't speak to me for months until one got fired for stealing and the other became my new manager and had to.

**That thing got a HEMI?**

It’s a normal day with normal customers. Nothing out of the ordinary to report. People are browsing our overpriced crap. I’m ringing up their overpriced crap. I finish my current transaction and head onto the sales floor in search of a customer who needs my help and knowledge. The first person I come in contact with can only be described as Bilbo Baggins-esque. The Lord of the Rings Bilbo, grey hair, a burning passion for The One Ring. You know, the usual. I approach Bilbo and ask him if I can assist him on his journey.

Me: Hello

Bilbo: HEMI. (He said without making eye contact or greeting me in any way. I do around 40 transactions a day on the register and probably speak to twice that many people. 90% of them are nice and pleasant. They treat me like an actual human being instead of a service droid. Bilbo was part of the 10%. The 10% that think just because I wear a zazzy uniform and a name tag that I won’t choke a bitch.)

Me: HEMI? Like… a truck? What’s it for? (I was confused. More confused than the time I watched Prometheus aka The Girl with a Dragon in Her Cooch*.)

Bilbo: TV. (Bilbo only speaks one word at a time. He must have had a rough time in Valinor. With the second word I realize what Bilbo is after

Me: Oh

Bilbo: WHATEVER! (He actually yelled at my head. It’s ok to make a mistake and call something by the wrong name, but we would be getting another shipment on Wednesday. Repeat this until one of us dies. 

Instead, old balls and weirded myself out. Father Time is not good to male genitalia.)

Me: Hahahaha! Yeah

Bilbo: *mumbles something that I can’t understand* (It kinda sounded like he said, “These cables are expensive.” Speaking more than one word at a time must have broken his brain.)

Me: Alright


**tl;dr – Bilbo Douchebaggins

*This joke comes courtesy of Red Letter Media.




**Boys have a penis. Girls have a vagina.**

A customer levitates into the store. He is the God of Dicks, he’d be Dickfeld. If he were a standup comic, he’s be Louis D.I.C.K. I’m saying that this particular gentleman is a dick.

Me: Hello. What can do for you?

God of Dicks: Adapter. (I’m sorry

Me: For what?

God of Dicks: Just show me where the adapters are.  (I’m sorry that I’m inconveniencing you by trying to help you find the exact thing that you drove to the fucking store to get. I apologize for not pointing in a random direction and just saying

Me: Half the store is some kind of adapter. You’re gonna need to be more specific.

God of Dicks: *sighs* Male-to-Male coax. (That really must have exhausted you. Here

Me: What are you trying to do? Couple some coax cables?

God of Dicks: No. I. Don’t. 

Me: Alright. (I give up. Fuck this guy. I’ll sell him what he asked for. I’m gonna let him drive home

I sell him the adapter and he leaves. 30 minutes later he calls the store, and changing lanes without signaling.

Me: Thank you for calling Crappy Electronics

Me: Oh

God of Dicks: That guy didn’t know what he was talking about!

Me: What?

God of Dicks: He sold me the wrong thing! (He seems to be having a different conversation than I am. I’m just gonna fuck with him.)

Me: Ohhhhh

God of Dicks: I needed a blah blah blah. ( I stopped listening and started browsing reddit. Wow. Horses can’t throw up. He finishes ejaculating his dick voice into my ear.)

Me: Bring it on in and we’ll get you the right thing.

God of Dicks: Are you gonna be there?

Me: Oh

I go grab the correct adapter and wait. On this night a god will fall.

A few minutes later our villain returns. He enters the store and one of my associates greets him. I’m about 15 feet away doing fucking whatever, The Dick of all Dicks, opens his dick mouth and sprays the store with a golden dick shower of lies and dick.

God of Dicks: That guy doesn’t know what he’s talking about! ( He points at me)

Other Associate: I’m sorry. What can I help you with? 

God of Dicks: I need an adapter for two coax cables.

Me: He needs a coupler.

God of Dicks: I’m not talking to you

Other Associate: Um…

Me: Are you a plumber?

God of Dicks: What?
Me: Plumbers tend to use the opposite terms for adapters and such then.. (He cuts me off.)

God of Dicks: I just need the right thing. (Then he throws the adapter he purchased earlier on the counter.)

Me: Let me finish. Coax cables have male ends. The part you plug it into have female ends. If you want to connect two male pieces together then you need a *female* coupler.

God of Dicks: No. That’s not right. 

I pick up the male-to-male adapter and produce the female-to-female one out of my pocket. I lay them side by side and ask him which one looks like the coax cables. He points to the male-to-male.

Me: Ok

God of Dicks: No it’s not!

Me: See that little piece of wire poking out of the middle? That means it’s a male.

God of Dicks: You don’t know anything.

Me: It’s basic biology.

He then looks at me with the most confused look on his face. The look that says

Me: Boys have a penis. Girls have a vagina. (Yeah. That’s right. I quoted Kindergarten Cop. And you know what? It worked. He totally got the reference. We all had a good laugh

God of Dicks: Go get me the manager!  (I smiled. It was actually more of a smirk than a smile. I was about to become a mushroom cloud laying motherfucker

Me: I *am* the manager. You can either take your money and leave *or* you can take the *proper* adapter you need. Your choice. (I told two lies. 1: I wasn’t the manager

God of Dicks: Gimme the right one.

Me: That’s right

God of Dicks: I don’t need this shit! See if I ever shop here again!

Me: I don’t know what we’ll do without you.

So in the end

**One Flew Away From the Nonexistent Bird Establishment**

Bird Lady: Bird store.

I heard her but ignored it. I didn’t know she was actually addressing me. I continue on with my customer.

Bird Lady: Bird. Store. (I’m sorry. That’s the incorrect password. It’s actually ‘Swordfish’. Come back tomorrow and try again.)

My customer and I are probably standing 4 feet away from each other. I’ve got my back leaning up against the tables with all the cell phone displays.  He asks me about battery life, this man is not my jilted lover and you are not Steve Wilkos. Give us some space. “Bird store,” she whispers. Fight or flight kicks in. I throw a right elbow at her but she dodges it. She hops back and pulls an Uzi from under her old lady jacket. I immediately start cart wheeling away as bullets strike the cell phone dummies. HTC Evo 4G; destroyed. Samsung Galaxy SIII; demolished. See you in hell, Pantech Revue! I come to a stop near the iPhone cases when I realize that her gun has jammed. I pull the Bowie knife from its sheath on my right ankle and threw it at the Bird Lady. It struck her in the chest, went through her back and pinned her to the cash wrap. She drops the Uzi and slumps down. I turn to the camera, pull the cigar out of my mouth and say, “Someone call a doctor. This lady needs *tweetment.*”

That didn’t happen. I just told her that I had no idea where the Bird Store was. She then coughed on me and then left.

**tl;dr – Just read it. It’s a short one.**

My story today is about grabby customers.  The candy at my kiosk is stored in bins like [this](http://www.candyconceptsinc.com/assets/images/verticalscoopcandybins.jpg).  And for sanitary reasons, it's the number one priority above even customer service.  Nobody wants to eat germy candy.  So we have signs that say bare hands in the bins will result in the purchase of the entire bin.  Despite those signs, I still have people reach in on an almost daily basis and take out candy!  

This story is about an older lady who wander into the kiosk.  She was being really rude from the start, ""oh, I only took one!""  HOLY SHIT do you think I care!  Would you want to eat that candy if someone took a piece?  What if you were with your grandkid and they did that?  You'd slap their hand and say DON'T TOUCH.

I don't understand how they think just because they're an adult they an ask like a child and get away with it.

So I don't have the guts yet to charge people for a whole bin.  This store's only been open for a few months and I'm the only person there.  What I did do was take the top layer of candy that would be thrown away otherwise and stuck that in her bag.  And of course she threw a hissyfit.

""I don't want that candy!  It was stale!""

""Well, and then found out it was stale and not have to buy any of it.""

""I'm going to return it and say it's stale!""

We got done surprisingly fast and at about 9:20 I called my bf to see where he was at since he's usually there by then. Turns out they'd had like a bunch of people stay in the store after close and he couldn't come me until 10pm.

Anyhow, like using the drymounter, or stretching a canvas. I knew how to do it in theory (so I could explain it to do-it-yourselfers), but in-house we had to use a motorized staple gun (kind of like a nail gun, but with staples) that was very noisy and tempermental. I hadn't been shown how to use it yet, but we hardly ever had to stretch a canvas in-house anyway because most people who buy un-stretched canvases want a frame (so it is sent to our framing facility) or were artists who wanted to do it themselves to save money.

It was 3 days before Christmas. The framing manager told me that I could do in-house jobs (like cutting mats, I could not take any in-house jobs for things I couldn't do, because she had to finish up the Christmas-rush orders the next day and wouldn't be in on Christmas eve. If I took the job, I had to do it myself. Fortunately, I only had one drop-in-the-frame-job which took all of ten minutes, so for the rest of my shift I helped out with the Christmas madness (as well as doing pick ups and taking non-Christmas orders of course). 

10 minutes before closing I was called to my counter to help a customer. I was thinking that this late at night it HAD to just be a pick-up. Oh how naive I was, you don't want to rush through the selection process). 

Customer: I wanted to get this canvas stretched

Me: (mentally sighing) Ok. Let's see how big this is.

C: (pulls out huge canvas) Oh and I need this by Christmas.

**The Idiot:**

A few years back, organizing panties or something, when a woman walks up and asks me to ring her up. I walk over and begin scanning her items when her son wanders off towards the expensive leather jackets in the women's section on the other side of my register.

The woman is paying absolutely ZERO attention to her son, and begins swinging back and forth screaming 'IMMA CHIMPANZEE IMMA CHIMP...'
Of course
I run over, and attempt to get the (FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH) coats off the ground.

The lady (still at the register
Flabbergasted
And then yeah. I rang that bitch up. FML.

**The Asshole:**

I had a guy come in with a bag of items he wanted to return one day. He pulled them out, they had OBVIOUSLY been worn, washed, worn again for a couple months. They had bleach stains all over them and reeked of cigarettes (I had just gotten in from a smoke break and the smell made me take a physical step back).

I said I would have to get the manager's approval and called her over. She hemmed and hawed for a bit then decided we could only do store credit (when we pointed out the bleach stains he said ""well that's why I'm returning them! I don't even own bleach!"" ...bullshit).
Finally he picked out his new items and came back to me for the exchange. Mind you, both way too old to need one. Stealing, much? I ring up the items and hand them over... at which point he leans over and whispers ""It's a good thing this all worked out... I would hate to have gotten... upset."" and pulls out a giant freaking knife.

I back up, staring me straight in the eye the whole time, and cuts the tags off his new clothes. When he was done, he pocketed the knife, went and got his family from... the dressing room (which really, they had no reason other than the fact they were stealing from us to be in there).
As soon as he left I went straight to my manager and she assured me that

After that, in fact, way bigger than the legal limit, and that he did in fact steal a whole BUNCH of shit from us.
About a month later I was across the street on my lunch break when, and got to watch, gleefully, as the asshole was gracefully tackled right in front of his wife and kids about 30 seconds after walking through the door.

To begin with there all relatively polite

They carry on drinking and Meat head #1 is getting drunker and more volatile as the minutes pass by.

Around 3 hours after they arrived meat head #1 is ruined. He comes to the bar to ask for a drink. I politely refused him and explained I could be fired for serving someone alcohol whilst intoxicated. This is where shit starts to go down. Meat Head #1 starts ranting and raving he wants a drink

Meat head #2 relays our conversation meat head #1 who comes storming to the bar wanting to know what my fucking problem was? He then goes onto try and humiliate me

I replied

Well, walking like a monkey, chest pumped out, fists tights.  He gets to the end of the bar and comes behind the bar, straight for me. He gets within 2 feet and swings a punch at me....

Now

I have absolutely no idea where it came from but I avoid his swing and returned with a blow Hulk Hogan would of been proud of. I dropped this meat head like the sack of shit he is. He's out cold for about 15 seconds

He gets up, he falls straight over wiping out a bar top full of dirty glasses.

At this point, tells me to chill, he saw I acted in self defense and besides ""you'll probably kick my ass if I fired you anyway"".

One thing I always told my employees was that if they ever felt like they were being treated less than a human being feel free to refuse service or

Here's a few episodes:

(Keep in mind that my shop was on the first floor of a skyscraper that housed mostly lawyers. Most of them were regulars and were completely professional and polite. They are always the few

There were a group of lawyers having a meeting. One of them came up,"" I said. I turned it down a notch and went back to making drinks. 

Five minutes later the same suit penis comes up and says

""I will change it when I get a chance, not fucking Slayer.

""It's Black Sabbath. And I find it odd that you would choose a place to have a very important meeting that is playing Black Sabbath. Not too professional

Another one:

Being in the downtown area we got our share of panhandlers and miscreants. I had a zero tolerance policy for them...though there were always exceptions. (One guy, meh, I don't care.) The girl running the register came up to me and said that there was a drunk dude saying rude things to all the girls and that they were all starting to feel uncomfortable. 

I walk up and there he is

""It's none of your business. I'll tell you what I am wearing

""You have to go.""

I count. I reach five. I jump the counter and grab him by the back of his coat and push him out so hard that he stumbles and lies face down on the sidewalk in front of my shop. I grab his arms and pull him to the corner and leave him

Never saw him again. 

It has been years since I had that job but I have more stories if anyone is interested. 

**NEW STORY.**

Sorry for the delay but I didn't expect the love

As I stated before I managed two stores in the downtown area. While at the first one I received a call from a ""customer"" that said he bought 50lbs. of coffee for his church and had us grind it for him. I was unaware of this (such a big order would have been brought to my attention) but kept listening. He was ""so embarrassed"" that when he got the coffee there were pieces of foil in it. Now I had helped out on the production line before and knew that it was nearly impossible for such a thing to happen.

""I can gladly get it ready for you tomorrow.""

""No

It seemed shady but I didn't feel like dealing with it. ""Sure. I will be in tomorrow from open to 4pm. Come on by and I will give you the money.""

""Thank you

Red light. Whenever someone says 'god bless' I distrust them.

He comes in

Done.

Months later.

I have been transferred to the other store in the downtown area because that manager pretty much fucked the entire operation. I was brought in to bring it back into the black. A few months in...

""I bought a bunch of coffee for my church and had it ground up and there was foil in it.""

Hello

""I am SO SORRY that happened. Come on in and I'll give you your money back."" He said that he would be in at a certain time. I called the police.

The police and I are shooting the shit for a while and we made up a plan. When he comes in they will act like they just got a call and leave so as to not freak him out. After I stall him a bit they will come back in and detain him (can't arrest him as there is no proof of anything

Here he comes.

I recognized him from before and played it cool. The cops left. The employees were all in on it so they handled it perfectly. One of them came up and knew that I knew so just asked me about nonchalant things. I then approached him.

""Can I help you?""

""Yeah

""Oh

""Yeah.""

""And it was really embarrassing...""

""Yeah...

""NO...I tell you what...stand here for a sec

The cops roll in.

""What is this

""You may not remember but I helped you with the last time this bullshit incident happened. These boys are just gonna run your name through the system and even if it checks out you are banned from all the businesses in the loop.""

1349149738.0,10sse8,Ray calls his Mommy.,violetshockwave,344,53,55,"We're a fairly small grocery store and we mainly employ kids in high school looking for an alternative to McDonalds for their first job. Usually they aren't a problem aside from the occasional drama fest or immature jokes. However we recently got this one boy working the register that just...just...ugh... He is 16 and has been here a few weeks. Let us call him Ray.
 Ray is the slowest cashier we have but insists on working our express lane so he doesn't have to bag a lot of items. Even the 60+ year old women are faster than he is. Every time he works our lines get backed up but our manager, an area that has at most two people working at a steady pace is reduced to one with two lines of people to take care of because this one guy can't scan a few cans. Not only that but he just can't seem to grasp the simplest of rules/procedures around the store.
 
Two things happened today that makes me think he needs to be fired.  Number one, was that he had let two pennies drop in his register and didn't know what to do. A little annoyed I tell him 'Well I guess you'll be two cents short tonight Ray' and hang up. About twenty minutes later  h e calls again and asks 'Were you serious about that penny thing?' And I have to tell him yes unless he wants to crawl under his register (which is disgusting)  through the service door and find the two pennies. He just hangs up on me.
So this same night I catch him bitching out our only bagger. She's an older woman from India and her English isn't the best but she's pretty cool. So I see this while I'm on break and he calls her lazy because she wouldn't stop what she was doing to come bag his probably 20-30 small items so he didn't have to. We have six cashiers and one bagger, I often worked the express line and would time my orders compared to the others when I was bored) Last thing I said was that if I see this again then I'm going to get the manager to handle his attitude. 'Okay' is all I get.

The rest of the night goes by just fine but when I get ready to leave I see someone sitting out in their car. I walk outside a little wary being paranoid as always. There in the car is Ray and who I assume is his mother. She gets out and comes up to me in the parking lot and starts bitching about how I mistreated her son and I have no right to talk to him like that. Before answering I take a quick look. I'm off the store's property, can't understand simple things after they've been repeated to him tons of times, and feels the need to verbally abuse other coworkers. Her son is an ass and her showing up to bail him out after he was talked to by his supervisor (me) for his actions is not helping. She's probably the reason he thinks he gets to act like this then just call mommy dearest if someone says anything to him.

I was just going to leave it at me talking to him for talking to our bagger like that but after his call to mom I think I'm going to be writing Ray up for this.

Small update: 
So I talked to my manager about the issues we had with Ray. Turns out I'm not the first person that he sicked Mommy on. He did the same thing to my grandmother ( who works with me and has been at this store for ten years now) because she caught him taking an hour break when for his schedule he's allowed one 15 minute break. Mommy met with her in the parking lot and complained that since my grandmother isn't a manager she has no right to tell her little boy what he can and can't do.

I'm checking out at my favorite grocery store with my boyfriend. I have several things in my cart and get directed to a register. The cashiers here are pretty friendly and at least say ""Hello"" or ""How is your day""

Cashier is ringing me up

Wutwutwut. I bought no squash today. I don't even particularly like squash. I quickly realize that the cashier has rung up my bag of small Persian cucumbers as squash.

Note that I'm usually the kind of person who, for example if I ask for a salad without onions in a restaurant and get onions anyway, I won't complain and will just shut up and eat my salad. When I do object, I'm really polite and nice about it because I work in the service industry myself and dealing with bitchy customers is the worst.

I'm almost about to let the baby squash thing slide

Pudding: ""Um

Cashier: ""These are called baby squash.""

Pudding: ""They're actually Per--""

She looks at me like I'm stupid. Maybe I'm projecting a little but I feel like her attitude is because she's so much older than me. I'm suddenly aware of how short my shorts are.

Slightly peeved now but uncertain (maybe I did accidentally get squash?) I pay and leave the grocery store and start to walk home with my boyfriend. As we walk past the entrance

Sure enough, upon checking my receipt, I realize that the ""baby squash"" was $8.99 per lb. OH HELL NO. Okay so it's only a couple bucks, but still, why should I pay more than twice the price for something? I am not that loaded.

I go to the Customer Service booth and explain to the lady there that I was charged incorrectly

The customer Service girl looks up which cashier checked me out, boyfriend and I are giving each other ""oooooh shit"" looks.

I was on bar, perfect. I write her specifications on the cup and ask ""Could I have a name for your drink?"" ... And this is when things went south. 

Bitchface: ""No. There's no one else in here."" In the snottiness tone. 

Me: ""Oh. Uh..."" That's weird. Just trying to be nice and follow policy. 

Bitchface: She snaps ""You know what? It's a stupid policy anyway I wish you would just stop asking such stupid questions.""

Okay, I decide that I will kill her with kindness. I hand her the drink and in the most genuine tone I could muster I tell her to have a great night. Her small response almost drew me over the edge. She looks at me. Scoffs. And walks away. 

I was so close to jumping over that counter and punching her in the throat. I'm sorry that I tried to make your fucking day a little better by being nice. And you know what?

I never got a review in 2012. Neither did the majority of the staff. I'd asked about it repeatedly, so I took up asking about it, and she kept putting me off until she left for maternity leave. So I took it to the acting GM, who took it to the DM.

I'll leave out the conversations for the most part, as you might expect, had a major wtf (calmly) fest with the acting GM and DM. She (the DM) did what you'd expect to try to smooth it over, promising she'd look into it, telling me she didn't think it was true at this point so why worry, etc, etc. Well I asked her to do two things for me: 1) see if the other people who hadn't gotten a review (who are all senior staffers) also received an NI; and 2) pull my actual review.

Well a few days later she has actually jumped through all the HR hoops and pulled my review, she said she'd pull my review from the year before and compare signatures. Yesterday she called to say someone had forged my signature on the new review. Guess who is the only one who had access.

So, and word has gotten around to the point that three managers have begged me not to quit (I never threatened to, considering I'm looking for a second job anyway). Well today aunty DM called again to talk with the GM and me, and proceeds to tell me all the ways I'm awesome. ""You're really good at training people.

1360728836.0,18fbi7,Crazy Bag Lady Finale: A Cashier's Revenge,egwenealvere,354,63,45,"Hello there

Fortunately for me, this is the story of my greatest victory against the wretched wench, or at least, ya know, it left me feeling pretty good. Whatever.

 Shortly after the last encounter with CBL, I was put in charge of the front end during the later hours of my shift, making me the PIC. It was wonderful! I would only be on a register if there was a rush and spent the rest of my time helping customers and other departments. I finally earned some respect from our usual grumpy customers. But after three weeks, still hadn't had a run in with CBL. It made me quite happy, to say the least.

All was well with the world... until I got called to the front end for assistance with a customer. I felt a knot in my stomach as I checked my watch and realized it was around the time that CBL usually wobbled her way into the store. (*Shit! Please don't be her!*) I made my way up front, she would have to bend to my will or leave with nothing. Cue Mr. Burns *Excellent*.

The newest cashier was the one dealing with her. Poor girl looked like a deer caught in headlights. She had recently gotten all the paperwork on corporate policy

**Me**: What's up

**Trish**: This customer said she wanted paper bags

**CBL**: No! I told you to call a manager! (She then gives me a snarky look

**Me**: (As condescending as possible) I'm sorry ma'am

**CBL**: No

Poor Trish didn't know what to do. She just kept looking between the two of us and using her eyes to plead with me to get rid of this woman. Oh

**Me**: Trish

**CBL**: You can't do that when you have a customer! (She was fuming at this point.)

**Me**: (As I was getting behind the register after Trish had nearly bolted out of there, but I cut her off this time) And for that matter, let me tell you that your weekly purchases in no way pays for a single cent of my paycheck. I get paid by my corporate for doing my job. And I work very hard! And even though it's pretty good pay at this point, it's not *nearly* enough to make up for the way I get treated by people like you daily. This store owes you nothing more than what you pay for, and I'm pretty sure you can't handle slave wages, so the most you'll get out of me is a greeting, your items bagged, if you're done complaining about non-issues

**CBL**: Oh

**Me**: And that's certainly within your right. (I'm now signed in and ready to go.) So

**CBL**: (Groaning

**Me**: No problem. But I *will* have to charge you an extra 5¢ for every paper bag. (*In your face

**CBL**: (Still through her teeth) Fine! But your managers will hear about that as well!

**Me**: Oh that's fine

So I finished her order and sent her on her way after receiving the deadliest glare from her. A little while later Trish made her way back asking how it went. I gave her the gist. She said she'd have my back if she really did come back in to complain. So I thanked her and told her she did a good job in trying to follow policy and not just backing down without calling me. I went home feeling pretty good. Slept like a baby that night.

Next shift, all I heard from a manager was a ""good morning"". Trish had the same deal. No one mentioned anything to her either.

I worked there for another few months

I was working a pretty typical 9-5 front service shift. I was basically down to do whatever needed to be done. Cleaning, running register, etc. The beginning of this tale takes place at about 12:50PM. I was covering one of our express (10 items or less) registers for the other cashier's 12:30-1:00PM break, and then was scheduled for the 1:00PM-1:30PM shift pushing in carts. This is important later.

I'm ringing up all the cool customers who can count to 10 when an old lady walks up with

""I have 11 items""

Now, but I'll be goddamned if I don't hate being lied to.

""That looks like more than 11,"" I replied, trying my best to be polite.

She huffs and puffs

She pokes her head back in after I take a couple of customers and says ""I have *fifteen* and *I don't like your attitude*""

I said the only thing I could think of at the time

She ends up checking out in the line behind me (because I had a customer in my line l-o-fucking-l) and I closed my register as it was time to hit the lot and do carts. As I walked outside I noticed she was at the customer service desk

I bring in a group of five carts and pass her as she's leaving, my managers doesn't write me up because in my years of working there I almost never have customer complaints.

So i fucking walk back around basically have to get on my knees and grab the rest of her returns, because our checkouts are too high for her to be able to put her stuff on the conveyor belt (Nobody else has ever had this problem, and people in wheelchairs have no problems). 

Basically she had cans of chick peas

**Her**: ""Because you idiots sold me expired products!""

So i start scanning

**Me**: These expired ~2007

**Me**: Unless you can provide me proof in the form of a receipt indicating you purchased the chickpeas

**Her**: ""I need your manager!""

**Me**: I am the currently on staff manager

At this point she relents and takes her chickpeas back but not after she bitches about she can't grab her cans and put them into her scooters cart. So i walk all the way around and put them back in her cart basket. (ARE YOU TOO FUCKING FAT TO GRAB THEM). In total she ends up with like 30 dollars in the form of a refund.

I just wanted her out of the store at this point. But no she needs to do some ""Shopping"", but i am not assigning an employee to be your own personal grocery shopper. She bitches some more and rolls off.

Looking back at this I really fucking wish i did assign her

When ever she couldn't reach something that would require her to stand  there would be a **BEEP BEEP**

She even told one of the people who was working on the floor (he was setting up displays for halloween)

From where i was working i could see her in the aisle directly infront of me, she tried using her umbrella to pull stuff off the shelf. End result? Broken glass everywhere.

[http://i.imgur.com/1vxHz.gif](http://i.imgur.com/1vxHz.gif)

Does she give a fuck? Nope just rolled on.

She ended up leaving without buying anything

* The shelves are too high for her disability
* We weren't accommodating to her ""disability""
* The aisles were too small
* Checkout lanes were too small
* And some other bullshit

Furthermore she is going to file a complaint against me personally because i refused to help her. I just pointed out that we are not your personal caretaker and told her to leave and never come back.

What the fuck is wrong with people? I need to cry. 

*EDIT* I am not hating on obese people are terrible or anything like that. People have medical reasons for using scooters to get around. The lady for all i know has a medical condition

* Treat me and others like shit
* Feel you are more important than other people
* If you have a problem reaching stuff then i suggest finding or asking for help, i suggest bringing a friend or someone to help you. 
* We are not your personal servants

So today during work i talked with the store manager and explained what happened

Unfortunately he explained how if she did injure her self

However he also said the way she acted he would have just asked her to leave for be insulting to employees.

Backstory:  One of my brothers earlier careers was working as a ""show dresser"" for cattle. Now

Anyway, they can do so **very** quickly.  If you don't want to be on the receiving end of said kick, you have to develop extremely fast reflexes.

So now to the main story:  one night my brother and his friend were standing outside a bar that featuring nearly naked women dancing for money (aka titty bar).  They were just talking prior to driving home when this young kid comes out and decides he's going to go all Jackie Chan on my brother.  You know

After a minute or two of this, because he has developed said extremely fast reflexes, when the kid does his next leg kick, my brother just grabs the kid by the ankle and proceeds to drag him around the gravel parking lot a couple of times.  Meanwhile this kid is yelling and screaming from the pain of contact with the gravel.  It was probably face up so the kids shirt is hiking up leaving his bare back exposed.  Being dragged around on gravel does wonders for the kids attitude (quiets down real quick).

It's around 6pm.

They head off to shop, and I put my nose back into a copy of Grimm's Fairytales. For a while, things proceed as normal, until I hear them wander up to the clothing counter to my left to check out. Because I'm human and respond to noise, a bit like a souless, I turn to look at them.  
  
The way the layout is set up is rather simple. I sit in my desk to the left of the entrance. To MY left is the clothing counter, marked down to half that. It's still very expensive and I don't really know why they don't keep it farther from the door, as I don't sit there all the time. That night, however, I was.  
  
The boy of the twosome, we're talking a 75$ ring, so you can imagine it's original price. As I go to turn back to my book, he does it, out of the corner of my eye, and my head snaps back around. He slipped the ring off his finger and *made to put it in his pocket*.  
  
Satan must've whispered in his ear that he was being watched, it was a silent battle of wills. He knew I'd seen him, and was debating whether he could still get away with the precious. I only stared, and the blank, soul-hungry eyes of a cold ginger must've finally broken his bravado.  
  
Slowly, hoping I would stop staring. He asked what the ring said (It's our damn brand name, like everything else in the dealership). Every so often, the young bandit glanced at me, eyes first full of hope and then bursting with fear. When he could stall no more and the father was getting his reciept, it became clear to young Robin Smeagol that he had been bested. Defeated, he put the ring back into its box, but everything else was present. The girls running the clothing department were shocked when I told them what'd happened

He got up in my face ""My wife just did it, why can't I?."" I explained that his wife had purchased a ticket and that he should go do so as well, as it's only 2 dollars. 

He left the lighthouse and I watched him through the side window. He went over to his wife and took her ticket. He tried to come in with the same ticket that I just saw him take from his wife and had already punched, to a register in a store full of tourists, and making it back with a ticket in thirty seconds.

Long story short, you can find 2 dollars on the ground if you look hard enough, basically making me seem like a jerk. But I digress.

Here's another one involving those pesky tickets.

A group of women came in and we directed them to the craft shop to pick up their tickets. There were about four in the group, and I explained that they needed two more. The bigger lady in the group was being snobby and said that the girl at the counter in the craft shop said that 2 people could get into the site for one ticket (misunderstanding the 1 ticket = 2 sites thing that I mentioned earlier). I explained this to her but there was no getting through. She threw her tickets down on the floor and stormed out. A week later, my supervisor came over and told me that he had received an email from that woman complaining about shoddy service and that the site should be closed down. My supervisor just laughed and said he added her to his junk folder.

* First up is a gem that will go by the name of Lazy Douchewad. He quickly discovered exactly how much he could get away with and exploited the hell out of it. He essentially made his own work schedule because he was incapable of working for more than 5 hours at a time. If he was scheduled to work from 9-3, he would get all defensive and walk out, only to show up the next day at whatever time was most convenient for him. This went on for far longer than it should have until one of my managers finally caught him trying to steal something from the store and told him to GTFO. Last I heard, LD was sitting in prison for one reason or another. Total time of employment: 3 months.

* Next on the list for today is a coworker we'll call Racist Twatwaffle, unloading trucks and doing carryouts for customers, and was hired shortly after Creeper Kid from Pt. I was let go. He was one of those people that only ever did his job halfway, and I had to essentially follow him around and fix everything he did. It got old real fast.

   RT was one of the most racist people I have ever met. Hispanic, it didn't matter, he would find some completely imaginary fault in them and just seethe about it after they left. It resulted in most of us just walking away from him when he got on one of his racial tangents. He got himself into trouble on more than one occasion for saying something he shouldn't to the wrong person. One day he came into work with a gnarly looking black eye. When we asked what happened, he said he was at a bar the previous night and a black guy punched him right in the face. We all just laughed, because we knew RT most likely completely deserved it for saying something stupid.

   His most annoying trait to deal with on a daily basis was the fact that he loved to talk. Boy he could talk. About anything and everything. I think [Dilbert said it best](http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/2012-03-07/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+DilbertDailyStrip+(Dilbert+Daily+Strip): RT was a serial talker. You would be trapped for hours while he strung together infinite, and come back ten minutes later still talking about the same subject. He would even talk to himself if no one was around to listen to him. It would have been funny if it wasn't so sad, pathetic and annoying.

   I could probably devote this entire post to RT, my managers hired him back to pick up where he left off. Fast forward 8 months, and RT took a week off for a vacation. First day he came back, he clocked in for about 2 minutes, and suddenly cleared out his locker and stomped out of the store, red in the face and shaking with rage. I asked my boss what happened, and he said that RT's vacation was unpaid, you need to have worked at the store for a full year (he hadn't

* I've saved the best (read: worst) for last. There have been a lot of bad employees go through this store, and would suddenly snap and start screaming bloody murder at you for something she imagined happening the next minute. She would get emotionally attached to every furry animal that came through the doors and would flip out if she even imagined someone ""abusing"" them. Customers that came into the store for feeder rats/mice would quickly learned not to ask her for them. If anyone said anything about feeding something furry to a snake, she would purse her lips and shoot daggers from her eyes at the offending party until they left. And that was on a good day.

   REB was always convinced that myself and the other pet dept. employees didn't give a rat's ass about the animals. She seemed to think that we would let everything in the store starve and/or dehydrate if she wasn't there to baby everything on a daily basis. On several occasions

   She was also an animal hoarder in the making. Remember how I said she would get emotionally attached to everything? Most of those animals ended up going home with her. Nary a week would go by without her buying a hamster/gerbil/mouse/nibblonian because she couldn't bear the thought of someone else taking it home.

   Finally, she burst into tears and began screaming at everything that was unfortunate enough to cross her path. She stormed out of the store screeching ""THAT BITCH STOLE MY JOB!!!"" I can't say I miss having her around. I dreaded every day I was scheduled to work with her because I knew I was going to do something to set her off. Total time of employment: 10 months.

I pull into the employee entrance to the garage and am immediately stopped by police and mall security. I let them know I'm an employee,000 people have lined around the mall. Everyone is trying to get in before the auto-lock doors open so they can get into our store and line up for the PS3. Here's the kicker, we have 12 PS3's. Half of which my manager has promised to his friends to begin with. I'm already thinking this is going to be a disaster. I told my boss we should have told everyone the 500+ people who have been waiting a week outside in crappy weather that we have a few units only, and there was no need for this madness. His logic was people would line up, and since they couldn't get a unit, they'd get something else instead. 

I make a quick tour of the mall, asking how the hell I got in. I quickly flash that I'm a mall employee and decide it's best to just head to my store. I was terrified they'd collapse the glass doors and murder me. Essentially I'm living in Dawn of the Dead. 

At 6AM the auto-lock on all 8 entrances in the mall open and the flood gates open. We purposely have kept our doors closed so we can try contain the madness as best as possible. I am standing in the store with my manager as I see people pushing and shoving, and I just shake my head no. But he gauges the distance to the ground, and leap to the 1st floor. Well his aim was off because he gets one leg land in the garbage pail. I'm thankful to this day that I never saw the actual damage his body took. Not one customer blinked an eye to help the guy. I ran to the back of our store and called 911.

The next 20 minutes were a blur, we didn't know when we were getting another shipment, and no they couldn't reserve a unit.

I brought all this to the attention of my supervisors, made proper complaints through the proper channels, and nothing changed for a year.

So I put in my two weeks notice right out of the blue, and a whole lot of miserable days and nights. But why are you leaving? The management asked. I just said I no longer wished to be employed by the company. This wasn't good enough for the higher ups, but that's all I gave them.

My last shift, but he says it's supposed to be cheaper. He saw a sign. Now, this sorta thing happens where an old sale sign is left up. If it is, we take it down, and give it to them for that price with our apology. So I say, ""Oh, ok well let's see.""

Dude flips his wig. ""Whatdya mean let's see. You calling me a liar?"" No word of a lie, it might be an old sign so I just need it brought here so I can ring it through for ya."" ""This is bullshit! You're disrespecting me, I don't even want it!""

This sets him off even more, asking why I was even working here in the first place, etc. Clearly, manager realizes he said the wrong thing, and tries to calm him down and finally takes my side, explaining the procedure, I'm right and he's wrong and he's an moron.

Dude has none of it, I thought I heard tires squealing. He turns back around, marches right over to me and says, ""You know, you don't have to be such an @$$hole.""

I just sit there, ""all I said was have a good night, Sir."" I stare him right in the eye like I've never gotten to do with any abusive, insane, and otherwise unpleasant customer up until that point.

The main difference is that this store was part pawn shop.  They sold pawned electronics, vhs, and stereo systems.  They also sold used music.  Pawning your items, as you may know, doesn't get you much.  DVDs we took in for about .25 .50, even new releases.  CDs came in at under $1.  


After I came back from lunch one day, we put it in fresh shrink wrap, put stickers on it, and sold it as new even though we only paid a few cents.  For reference, the markup at the time was huge, DVDs were usually around $20-$25 and CDs were selling for about $15 new.  


So I'm doing this slightly unethical thing because I was a grunt who needed money.  The stickers said things like ""Featuring the new hit single!"" and ""Billboard top 40!"" ""Nominated for Award!""  The kind of shit nobody really pays attention to


I came across a pretty rare CD, it was free so how eBay dethroned free I'll never understand!) for $45.   There was a problem though, when I opened the case, I noticed it was a burned disc.  The dumb woman paid for a burned CD which is illegal.

*A bit of background before we dive in...* I work in the footwear department of a sporting goods store. I am trained in telling people about what is the best running shoe for them

Now on to the tale!

I was working opening until around 4 today, but it's during business hours, and we all know that customers will always come first in our daily activities.

Before noon, they ask if we have a certain shoe (we do not). I don't hear anything else from my manager, and I continue on with my day.

Some 20 minutes later, so I ask my manager about them. He said that he'll come over and explain it to me. Basically, I know that there's a tale to be told and I'm excited.

We'll call my manager Nathan.

Nathan says that the lady on the phone earlier might be stopping in. No big deal, he said that shortly after he told Martha that we didn't carry a certain shoe, she said ""Fine"" and hung up. Not two minutes later, she calls back and asks what are the cheapest stability shoes we have, he tells her which ones, and Martha tells him to put a size 10.5 on hold for her in those three styles.

Here's the thing, then get a few 10's and 11's, but no 10.5. My manager didn't know this, and put the 10 and 11 sizes for the shoes she asked on hold.

About an hour later, ""I'm looking to spend $50, no more!"".

I'm thinking to myself

**Me:** ""Ma'am

**Martha:** ""Stability shoes""

For those who don't know, etc. (avoiding joint damage and what not while running). This might have been judgmental, but I wasn't really convinced that she knew what stability meant, even though we have explanations plastered all over our department. She seemed pretty firm that she wanted stability shoes, and I decided not to give the speech about the types of running shoes.  

I didn't want to argue, but paired with the bulgy, beady eyes of rage. 

She then tells me to bring out the shoes on hold. 

I bring them out, and suggest maybe looking at the clearance rack if there are any bargains (you never know).

She ventures over to the clearance racks

She is amazed at how I know if they are stability just by looking at them

Martha finally decides to leave the store.

About a half hour before I leave

**Martha**: Hi

**Me**: Yes

**Martha**: Well it turns out I went to another store and they have this pair of shoes. I tried looking on my phone to see if they were stability or not

**Me**: Umm... is that the store located (on main highway)?

**Martha**: Yes it is. I'm here right now and I don't know how to describe them. You'll just have to come over to the store to see them. It was amazing how you could tell they were stability just by looking at them.

**Me**: Okay, you may come to our store and I'll be more than happy to answer them for you.

**Martha**: Well

**Me**: Ma'am, and an action like that can reflect poorly on my performance rating. I would like to keep my job since I do need the money.

**Martha**: But I'm here already and I don't want to purchase these if they're not stability. 

**Me**: Well, you can always buy them and then return it to that store if they do not work out.

Yesterday morning I went to yoga dressed in yoga leggings, I was invited out shopping, so I hopped on a bus in all my disheveled glory and went out with my friend.

We passed a shoe store that sells more expensive, and she was well dressed.

There were four people working in the store (that I could see). One immediately approached the other woman asking to help her, then had to flag one of the associates down to ask for my size. They took awhile getting the pair of shoes to me and basically just tossed them at me, while the other woman was being helped with measuring/sizing.

In the end

I don't expect sales associates to wait on me hand and foot, and when I asked for assistance I was mostly dismissed. I'm assuming that because I wasn't dressed in high end clothing they assumed I couldn't afford their products. But is that a reason to dismiss the customer?",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,1364825608.0,,

This means I have encountered my share of crazies

But this weekend took the cake for most frustrating. 

This weekend I had to apologize for my WEIGHT to a morbidly obese woman who threw a bitch fit that I weighed a mere 110 pounds.

""YOU CAN'T WORK HERE! YOU THINK YOU'RE FUNNY? ARE YOU LAUGHING AT ME?!""

To clarify, smiling or laughing.

She then proceeds to argue with my manager about how she should have her entire meal (~30 dollars) free for the inconvenience of stressing out over my weight. It was a sick ploy to guilt her into a depression

Seriously?

My weight was so much of an issue to you

This was only the beginning. 

A woman went through drive thru and gave our ordertaker/chasier 33 cents for a soda


The message come in through the headset

""Uh...aphrodite? The woman only gave me 33 cents.""

Ok

I open the window:

""GIMME MY SODA""

""I'm sorry m'am but it seems that the girl in back didn't receive the correct amount of change

""EXCUSE ME?! ARE YOU ACCUSING ME OF STEALING? GIVE ME MY STUPID SODA YOU CHANGE NAZI!""

I refuse again

The woman swevers into a parking space and stomps out. ""WHERE IS THE MANAGER"" she screams at one of the girls waiting to clock in.

My manager goes over and sees what the problem is

"" THIS MINIMUM WAGE RAT WON'T GIVE ME MY SODA. I WANT MY SODA AND MY DOLLAR BACK. THIS IS THEFT. I'LL HAVE YOU ARRESTED YOU WHORES.""
 
my manager asks her to calm down and she starts crying about how mean we were then suddenly she changes tactics.

""I GAVE YOU 20 DOLLARS! CHECK YOUR CAMERAS! CHECK. YOUR. CAMERAS.""

Part of being a security guard in this store is being very knowledgeable about the store and it's products because in the event that someone needs help then we must assist. Also if someone attempts to steal

So I was standing on the front doors when one of my coworkers approached me and informed me of a possible theft. He stated that some customers were currently on register paying for a $250 bicycle but they had a gel seat on the bike and it was missing the tag that has the price. My coworker also noticed that the customer was not going to make any attempt to pay for the gel seat. 

I alerted the other security guard of what was going on and told him to scrutinize the receipt for that customer. If he noticed that the gel seat was in fact on the bike but not purchased on the receipt then to please ask the customer if they have another receipt. 

Alright so the customer approaches the exit door and the other security guard asks for the receipt for the bicycle. He notices the gel seat cover on the bicycle and it wasn't purchased. He points it out to the customer

I head over to the section where the seat cover is usually located and I look around the immediate area. Within a minute I was able to find the broken tag/package that encases the seat cover. I head back to the exit doors whilst holding the package behind my back. I get to the door and show them the package. The husband turns so red with embarrassment I swear he almost went purple. The wife's eyes bulges out so far in the most Wtf state. They agree to pay for the seat cover and they go on their merry way.

I was working a day shift at a small ice cream shop which normally means not much will happen because we normally get most of our customers at night. A lady and her daughter (around 8-10 years old) walk in. Me and the other employee working at the time both walk up to her to say hello and what not. She tells us that she came in during the week and pre-paid for two ice cream cones because it was some sort of jewish holiday where you aren't allowed to buy things or something along those lines. We ask if she any sort of receipt or proof of purchase (the normal protocol would be for us to print out a receipt and write ""pre-paid"" with our signature). I can already tell that she is pretty offended by the question

I go to the back and check if there's any notes or anything about her. Nothing. I go back to talk to her and see that she's giving an earful to the other employee. I tell her I couldn't find anything in back and that we cant really do anything for her. This makes her go crazy. She starts yelling and saying how we've offended her and that she feels like a victim. We try to calm her down by assuring her we aren't making any accusations towards her but she isn't having it. I tell that I'll go call the manager and see if he knows anything about this. I call him up and he says that he never spoke to her but to just give her the ice cream so she'll shut up. I walk back over and tell her that I'll give her the ice cream and to just remember to keep a receipt next time. For some reason this made her even more angry. She starts getting very aggressive towards me (she doesn't mind the other employee so much because she found out that she is also Jewish). She was telling me to go away because she felt threatened and to have the other person serve her but I didn't want her to get her way so I just told her that I work here so I dont have to go anywhere. We have an aggressive conversation about her trying to get me to go away but she finally gives up. I ask her what size cone ordered

I decided to have a little fun and went to clean the tables next to her so she could feel ""threatened"" some more.

She took a few more steps into my office (I'm still on the phone at this point) and then my co-worker was able to guide her back into the hallway to find out what she needed. 

I was stuck on the phone unfortunately through most of her visit, but she was insistent that we were having a sale (did I mention there are 4 other suites in our building?) My co-worker's a nice guy so he humored her a bit and tried to explain what we do, all the while subtly guiding her towards the front door. She kept asking him for the price of random things around our office, like our motivational picture, our guest chairs, a printer, etc. He said she seemed drunk and apparently just wanted to buy *something*, the last few haggling over items that we had no intention of selling. Nothing he said could convince her that we weren't a retail store. I think he finally had to lie and say that he thought the 'store' next to us was probably having the sale because she just didn't want to leave. 

When I left work that day, saw a real estate sign, then walked over a mile in the sweltering heat down a nearly vacant road to our building, picked our suite as the one that must be having a sale, and refused to believe otherwise.

Well, my line starts to become much longer and I'm doing the best I can possibly do to take the orders and then get their food out, but the line is becoming ruthless. It looked like it was never going to stop. Now typically front counter is never that bad and I may have 5 people in my line at one time, but today I had about 20 people with only me to help them. 

Realizing that I can't possibly do this alone, she was counting tills and seemed preoccupied and really just flat out told me I couldn't get any help, which I knew was bullshit, as I could get someone from back drive thru, as it only takes one person to take orders and get the money, but I go back to the front to face the raging crowd.

I'm doing the best I can do, but I'm doing the best I can do. Some customers take much longer to order, so I cannot give other customers their food that is up, so they are forced to wait longer. 

Then this middle aged customer comes up obviously angered, so I fetch my manager who tells me she'll be there in a second, so I go back to the front and tell the man to just wait there for a second for my manager and I continue to get food to the customers and take their orders.

Then finally, he starts yelling at my manager for not getting someone to help me in the front, he even goes as far as saying that I was doing an amazing job, but it's was not my fault I could not possibly help all these people, I start smiling, as this made my day, I was becoming a little stressed over the abundance of people in the store

1372816054.0,1hjene,Poor choice of words,Sorkijan,338,59,44,"So I was a cashier for the longest time (five years

I got off at 8:00 PM and it was 8:20 PM. And the only reason I was staying late was because the CSM (Cashier Manager basically for those unaware) decided to have me give someone a 15-minute break five minutes before I get off work. It sucked, but this particular cashier was amazingly notorious for taking longer breaks than actually allowed. She was pushing thirty minutes and I was getting pissed off. Not so much that I was having to stay later than I originally anticipated, but the principle. I never took a break longer than fifteen minutes. I would go to the bathroom, get a small bottle of water, drink it, then go back to work. Mine were normally less than fifteen, but I digress.
 
I was working the express lane this day (twenty items or *fewer*. Not always super enforced but sometimes people are just outright exceeding it). Two women walk in my aisle with literally two and a half cartloads full of merchandise - ranging from housewares to bedding to groceries - clearly exceeding twenty items. Normally I have a rather apathetic attitude towards this type of thing

It was at this point I decided to see if I could get dum and dee to go to a different line - one that not only doesn't have that restriction but is better facilitated for a large amount of items (conveyor belt

**Me**: Ma'am I'm sorry but this line is twenty items or less.

**Dee**: Oh no one ever follows that anyway.

**Me**: I apologize

**Dee**: If you don't like doing your job

I laughed.

Why did I laugh you ask?

Well something I didn't tell you the reader - perhaps because I like to write something that I'd like to read - was that this day was in fact my last day at work for this company. It was the last day of my two-weeks notice and I was going onto bigger and better things. I had already signed my ""termination"" papers on my last break two hours prior and done everything except turn in my badge. 

As I'm laughing

**Dee**: And just what the hell is so funny?!

This is the highlight of my speaking-fast-while-under-pressure-almost-like-I'm-in-a-movie career. By this time I had put the lane-closed sign down because the other customers who didn't want to wait had left. Also the cashier who I was giving a break to - normally they would come back to the same register - somehow had been put on a *different* register which meant I was going to get off god knows when. Obviously this is paraphrased.

**Me**: What you don't know, I am actually already ahead of you on your advice and have another job I'm starting Monday. So to that end, as I previously mentioned, this register is only for people who have at most twenty items. There's a lot more things I could say to tell you how I feel about the type of person you are and how you treat other people, but I have a feeling it would never sink in past your arrogance. I truly hope you have a better day than you clearly have.

I turned around

I also noticed that the two women were talking to the front-end manager and Dee (the one who was the big antagonist) was pointing in a random direction while somewhat shouting. 

I went home

TL;DR Women try to go through 20 items or less lane with **WAY** more than 20 items. I ask her to find another line she tells me to find another job. I tell her I already have and today is my last day

1371834727.0,1gszaz,What friends are actually for,FrostedJakes,327,48,31,"This was a few years ago while I was living in North Denver.  I had taken a job at an Illegal made-to-order burrito type place which happened to be located on a street that always had a lot of late-night pedestrian traffic.  We were open until 2:30am so we could catch the last call rush and were also only one of two places in the entire area that was open past midnight.

Needless to say

So it's about 2:15am on some random night.  I hear the door open and I turn to look and see 4 obviously wasted guys walking through the door.  Cool.  Nothing like a good late-night burrito to send you off to drunken slumber.  

I get through the first 3, stumbles over and asks for a chicken burrito with everything on it.  Now, we actually got this a lot; people asking for everything on it.  And usually, after I explain that it will include everything they see before them, they chuckle and then become more specific in what they actually want.  Not this guy.  GMB still asks for EV-ER-Y-THING.  Just like that.  I almost couldn't help from laughing since it reminded me of The Sandlot.

So I ask him one last time.  At this point, and waiting to see what he really asks for.  Nope.  This guy wants it all and won't settle for anything less.  So I make this soupy mess of a burrito and can hardly roll the damn thing up.  I end up having to use three different tortillas to keep it from oozing all over the place.  It's now the size of a bowling pin and barely holding together.

GBM gets to the register and sees the total and immediately starts causing trouble.  The burrito was something around $25.  I calmly explain to him that this is why I asked 3 different times if he was sure he wanted everything and he just looks at me and starts yelling about how he didn't want *all* of this.

I'm about ready to tell the guy to leave, ""Can you believe this shit?  $25 for a fucking burrito!  And look at it!  I can't even eat that thing.""  I'm preparing to have to kick all of these guys out as the other two, still sitting at the table, are also looking over and watching with interest.

Well

GBM's face is priceless.  You can see the gears turning and the realization that maybe he's the one being the prat.  He turns back to me with his head down and asks for a glass of water with his burrito while handing me his credit card.

Sure enough

His father kept giving very frustrated versions of no, and would ask me what else is good for him to play.

So Friday arrives, and tells me that he's going to be late; their event is running long. They won't be in until 10pm.

Honestly, one person short on the schedule. The store echoes with noise and the counters are a lake of milk. 10pm would be ideal, I tell the coach.

The rush dies down and I immediately hurry myself and the crew into stocking and cleaning like crazy; we have to prepare for the imminent arrival of The Bus. My grill cook starts to prep extra meat and fries

At this point, we're all guaranteed a long night after an exhausting day filled with hundreds of customers. Our company's closing rules have exemptions for special occasions, however - and a party of 50 starving athletes definitely counts. We all brace ourselves and start to clean and stock. 

So we wait. We clean what we can to get ready for closing afterwards, and they're still not here. We're all starting to get anxious. We have a ton of product prepped and we can't exactly afford to just throw a ton of food away. My hands are tied.

I call the store manager and ask her how long she wants us to wait for them before we officially close. At this point I've closed the drive through

With dread in my heart and my keys back in my pocket, and myself taking the order on the register. They're all on the same ticket, which can get very confusing, and it's a tax exemption, so I can't afford to have anyone else ringing it up. 

The orders go as all 50+ person orders do - loudly, large fries, large shakes all around. We end up having to cook more food even after preparing for their arrival. By the time I have totaled the order and accounted for the tax exemption and the free bus driver's meal, their ticket is still upwards of $300. They're very grateful that we waited for them, but I don't think they realize how long of a night we're in for. 

They leave in the same rush they arrived in

I get most of the employees out as fast as I can

So when we last saw each other I told you of **The Baby Dyke** and her ways and customs. This time I will tell you about another sort of young girl. She’s 16 and is not quite sure if she’s gay or straight

We shall have to give our young protagonist a name. Hmm how about Violet since it’s a shade of blue? You see blue is her favorite colour. Her eyes are blue and her shoes are blue and one time she dyed a blue streak in her hair

Tonight is going to be big! Violet turned 16 two weeks ago and now she can get in to the gay parties in town. She’s going with all her friends that are old enough, she almost cried. Almost.

But tonight nothing can stop her. You see they let people in when they are 16, that’s so far away! Violet can’t wait till she’s 18, the day after her birthday she’s moving out. Goodbye mom, goodbye dad, have a great life!

Text message from Sheila “Hay

Oh yeah, she will try it, at least just so she can say she has. Okay, time to get ready.

At Sheila’s place they have WKD’s and shots. Sheila is so lucky, but she smokes them anyway. 

Kat has her hand all the way down her pants, didn’t I”. She opens the bag and dumps three little pills on the table. In between all the bottles and ashtrays they look so innocent. Like they could just be the ones Violet takes for cramps.

Kat hands them out, and one for Violet. They swallow and Violet’s pill is stuck in her throat. She takes a big gulp of WKD and it’s down. No way back now. They each grab an extra WKD and walk to the bus stop. Violet keeps thinking when the pill will kick in.

It doesn’t. They get on the bus and everything is normal. They get off at the station and walk to the party, everything is blue in fact. She looks at Sheila, her face is blue. She looks like an oversized smurf. Violet starts laughing. Laughing, laughing, laughing. Her voice sounds like crystal glasses taping against each other. Sheila is mad now, she is telling her to be quiet or they won’t get in. Of course they will, nothing can stop Violet

She’s keeps it together enough to get past the entrance.  Once in she heads immediately for the dance floor. The DJ is amazing and absolutely beautiful. It’s like she is talking to Violet through the music. Someone’s left their beer on one of the speakers. Violet doesn’t really like beer

She drinks and finds another once it’s empty. She’s dancing and laughing and drinking and whirling and suddenly so very tired. But there’s nowhere to rest

(So far so good right? I mean it’s a little different from the other two stories, I’m a filthy liar, but I couldn’t just dump you into the story where I come in. It would be much too confusing and there would be too many notes and parenthesis so I could explain it all. Anyway this is the part where I and my good friend and coworker Ray come in, you ready? Let’s go!)

So it’s a big gay party and as usual I’m in charge of the whole shebang (get it

•	Ray: “Neo to Ray

•	Neomety: “Neo here

•	Ray: “I have a situation in the bathrooms

•	Neomety: “Roger that

•	Ray: “Roger


Nah I’m bullshitting you. It was more like “Uhhhm Neo, be there in a mo” Yeah we don’t do radio etiquette.

Back to the story: I push through the constant flow from dance floor to bar to bathroom to dance floor, not fat, but big. He’s 205 cm, that’s 6 feet 8.7 inches for the Americans and 25 and a half hands for horse salesmen from the middle ages. And he weighs in at about 120 kilos, that’s 264.6 pounds for the Americans and 18.9 stone for the Brits.

Enough maths for now. The stall was tiny and Ray is big. That’s what I tried to convey. Ahem, on the floor, between Rays size 56 shoes (19, Americans) is a small girl in a beautiful blue dress. (SPOILER: it’s Violet) She’s passed out, so I kick in to “oh no” mode and do the first thing I always do in these situations. I grab around her shoulder, close to her neck and I squeeze firmly. This is a pain response thing, if they react, but it’s really bad if they don’t react. 

She yelps, this is starting to draw a crowd; I need her somewhere quiet and out of the public eye so I can work in peace. The break room it is.

Ray lifts her up like she weighs nothing. Hes carrying her like you carry your bride across the doorstep. In his arms she looks even tinier. We make our way through the crowd; I walk ahead and get people out of the way. I love it when I get to push the gay boys around a bit. Suddenly I hear Ray’s voice behind me “Uh oh, faster, faster, she’s slipping!” His arms are locked by the crowd swarming around us, all he can do is try not to drop her, but she keeps slowly slipping out of his arms. Meanwhile I’m in front of them, trying to shout people out of my way. “MOVE, I’LL HAVE YA ALL KICKED OUT UNLESS YOU MOVE

And that’s when it happened. This beautiful moment, and as she slipped, she turned a little. Just enough for Ray to clamp his enormous hand down on something to hold her by. Something, anything, to keep this girl from falling completely out of his grasp.  

We finally make our way through the mass of people and to the breakroom. I hold the door and Ray walks in sideways with his back to me. Then he turns around. The biggest shiteating grin on his face I have ever seen and he nods downwards. I look in the direction he is nodding. I see a young girl, literally, get his hands on, just to not drop her. And he’s gotten a hold on her...

...Boob.

He’s holding this poor girl by her boob and he is grinning like a maniac. I can’t help it. All concern for this poor soul flies out the window as I break down in tears. Tears of laughter that is. I actually get to my knees and rock back and forth trying my hardest not to piss my pants. And then there’s a knock on the door.

Ray quickly deposits the girl on the couch and wipes the smirk of his face. I attempt to wipe my tears and the look of immense joy of mine

 We got her and her friends into an ambulance to go get her stomach pumped. I heard from her mom a couple of days later, it was almost. And she paused for a second. Handshaped?!?

1372092563.0,1gz793,Job that made me quit retail work. Long story.,primesrfr,323,43,24,"Worked at a game store while I was still in college. Place was a semi mom and pop shop

Anyhow, sledge hammered through the wall to our store, quickly shut off the all the alarms and then had their pick of our merchandise. They cleaned us out. Systems, games, dvds. Not sure what the final count was as far as loss, but it was hefty. They did the same thing at one of our other locations.

A month went by and things started to get weird. The owner took up shop at our store a lot of days. Always sitting in the back and waiting for deliveries. Supposed wholesalers would come in with boxes, looked more like thugs and gang members. They would walk in the back and always walk out with cash. I had always handled the books when closing up the store. But now the owner took over my prior job. Also, he no longer had me go on runs to the wholesaler location to pick up games on new release days. He would always wait for his new wholesalers to bring him in what he needed. I noticed around this time that our prices also dropped. Games went from being 5 dollars cheaper to almost 10 dollars cheaper in some cases. The other employees and myself adopted a don’t ask don’t tell policy. I needed the job but at the same time, was scared of what was going on. The people coming in the store always looked so shady.

Next issue was one night when I was closing up the store with the owner. He was in the back and I was in the front closing up the register. The owner was a cheapskate and like to milk every penny and dime that he could. So he insisted that I keep the store open, or maybe I was just scared….not sure. But for whatever reason I was not in control of the things I was saying. I berated the two men, scoffing their guns and saying they were not real. Proceeded by telling them they looked like henchman from a movie. They advised me that their guns were indeed real and they would be happy to show me. At that point, my common sense kicked in and I gave them the money. But they were not done.

They wanted me to take them to the back. I obliged, the second guy had me at gunpoint in the bathroom waiting for everything to be over. Strange enough, the guy was actually really polite and apologized for having to take my cell phone. Anyhow, they took the money and that was that. 

That was not the worst of it though. Everything came to a head one day when I was off for a week and was awakened by two detectives at my front door. Apparently while I was off, merchandise…everything. Apparently the buying back of stolen items had been going on for as long as the store had been opened. The owner had been dealing with gangs to do his work for him. The reason why our store got robbed and broken into so many times was because these gang members knew that the owner kept large denominations of money at his stores to pay them with. Needless to say, I quit that same week. The police tried to call me into court for questioning or to be a witness, but nothing was ever pursued against me since I was not directly involved. I went into a different line of work soon after. Was done with retail.

I work at a large canadian bookstore, we have three types of product, books (obviously), home decor items, and kids toys. The latter unfortunately attracts exactly the kind of customer that I despise on a very personal level: The guilt-tripper. 

A lady came in today looking for some books for her children, recommended some of my favorites. The kids were awesome, kids like I was once, super keen on getting books. They ended up deciding on Tuck Everlasting, and my opinion of this group shot ever higher.

Cue checkout time. I walk them over to the kids section cash desk, which came to around $12. This is where the aforementioned high opinion got shot down. The mother apparently only had $8.50 on her. At this point I'm feeling awful, having to tell two kids, who can't be older than 8- and 10-ish, that they don't have enough for their chosen book. 

""Can't you knock down the price for my children"" asks the mother, and would get written up if my manager found out I did so. I had to tell her no, to which she replied, speaking to her children:

""Looks like the mean man won't let you have the book,"" glaring at me the whole time. I was shocked. She wouldn't chip in an extra $3.50 for her children? Not only that, she tried to use her children as a a prop to wheedle herself a bargain, and failing that, blamed ME? I was livid. People like that just ruin entire shifts for me.

We had notices posted on the employee board in the back of the store to call an MOD of Front End Supervisor for all returns involving these items. 

So this guy comes up to my register and wants to return this item

I process the return up to the key turn point, realizing that I was right to call him after the supervisor failed to do his job correctly, told the customer that he'd be getting store credit or nothing. He said he was going out of town the next day and needed cash. The manager told him that was impossible and the customer demanded to speak to the district manager. Come the eff on. Yes, the district manager is going to handle this? So my manager told the customer that the district manager was at a wedding and was unavailable, then asked the customer to leave the store. He outright refused so my manager looked to the other cashier and said ""call the police"". 

About 15 minutes later 2 police officers show up, who agreed to leave with store credit. 

So the guy goes after I finish the transaction and my manager calls my supervisor into the office and lays into him about a cashier knowing store policy better than the supervisor. He then wrote up a compliment/gold star/thing and put it in my employee file.

1361580531.0,191yup,A small dose of karma/justice from one customer to another,nolinkforme,327,48,56,"A tale of karma/justice what-have-you from my VERY short retail career.  Going anon really for no good reason.

Hired as a seasonal employee at a mall department store while I was in college, I’ve got a line of 50+ people but I’m OK.  Getting through each, one by one.  Everyone’s very patient and calm.

Enter the Bitch from hell.  She walked behind the counter and poked me in the arm

Me – “Ma’am I’ve got an extremely long line.  If you would like to get in line I can help you when it’s your turn”  (Yeah I was an idiot.  Or maybe just young.)

Bitch began to SCREAM at me “HOW DARE YOU!  I’m not waiting in any line!  You will come back and help me now.  You will show me respect!”  Customers in line started grumbling.  So I called for a manager.  One showed up

Me “It isn’t.  Those bags don’t ever go on sale.”

Bitch “Don’t be stupid.  Everything is on sale today.  Look it up!”

Me “I have to finish this transaction ma’am

Bitch “LOOK IT UP!”

Customer I’m waiting on “Just check it so she shuts the hell up”  I scanned it.  Sure enough it’s full price.

Bitch “Well I demand a discount because of your horrible customer service!”

Me “I’ll call the manager back.”  I continued to ring customers in line

Bitch “You are so incompetent!  I’ll just look around while you’re trying to find your brain.”

Me “You’ll have to leave the bag here behind the counter.

Bitch “WHAT!  You think I’m going to STEAL it!  You little fuck.  HOW DARE YOU!”  Ranted on for a few more minutes ending with “I AM NEVER SHOPPING HERE AGAIN.  I SPEND THOUSANDS HERE EVERY WEEK!  YOU HAVE JUST LOST YOUR BEST CUSTOMER!”  And stomped away.  I just kept working through the line of customers.  I had a few complement me on keeping my cool.

The absolute best was a woman about ten back in line when the woman was ranting.  She and her daughter reached the counter and she asked me “How much is that bag?”  I told her.  “Perfect.  My niece loves that type bag and she’s going to graduate college this spring.  I’ll take it!”

Daughter “MOM!  Really?  It’s kind of expensive.  I thought you were going to give her cash?”

Mother “She’ll love this more.  Besides I’d pay ten times that much so that Bitch can’t come back later and get it.”  I rang her out

Sure enough

The guy I was just finishing with looked at her.  “Thought you were never coming here again?  Never got pretty damn short all of a sudden.”

She turned bright red and just stood there screaming at the top of her lungs until security came and escorted her from the store.  The manager finally came back to tell me that several customers had gone back to file compliments but that I would be written up for failing to ‘deal appropriately’ with the Bitch customer.  Which was the exact moment I decided to never work retail again.   


EDIT - thanks for the comments - guess I should clarify - the Bitch was standing at a display case twenty feet or so BEHIND me.  I have no idea how long she was there before she walked over and poked me.  I had been in the zone of processing the line of people in front of me.  Should mention that another woman later that afternoon saw a purse in the display that she wanted, asked for the bag.  I ran back, grabbed it, and rang her out immediately.  No problem.

As for the write up - I was a seasonal hire, and listened to their bullshit about needing to have every customer leave happy.  Barely a minute after telling me how wrong I handled the Bitch, they asked me to stay on after the season.  I declined.  Walked out at week end and never walked in again.  I've never even shopped there.  And as much as I respect those of you who do, I've never worked a day of retail again.",,False,self,1361628124.0,t3_191yup

So one day, cool. I go, man the till, and about 10 minutes later I get this lady walk up to the counter with a few items. She places them down and I start to scan them. Suddenly she grabs my wrist and turns it over, and gasps with a loud,

""OH LORD!"". 

I blink, yet sad face. She then goes,

""Oh, but it's okay, there IS hope, there IS an answer! You don't need to do this to yourself! You're so young, you have so much to live for!""

...Now I'm just lost. After a few seconds of just a blank look I can't help but say ""Pardon me,

""YOUR SCARS! You're killing yourself! You need help! Why has no one helped you?!""

...Now it dawns on me. 

""Ma'am? Those aren't cutter scars. They're scratches. I work outside in the lumber yard. I get scratches. See? They go all over my arms. I'm fine

""NO! No you don't need to lie! You don't have to hide anymore! I'm here for you! I'm here!""

By now, I look at him with a shrug, and he tries to explain to her that no, really, I'm OKAY, but she won't hear of it, and starts to accuse him ""being ignorant"". Finally I've had enough and I just snap

""LOOK Lady, I would go ""down the street"" not ""across the yard"", and ""B"" I'd have cut a HELL OF A LOT DEEPER! Now, PLEASE leave me ALONE!""

Her look. The shock. That was great. Wide eyed look of pure shock then she RAN out of the store screaming she would ""get help for my poor soul"". Never did see her again. Expected my boss to flip for snapping like that

A long time ago, if an employee screwed up, I would try and be as nice as possible when pointing out mistakes in order to not allow them to happen again. But sometimes...well, sometimes a simple talking to wasn't going to help.

The location that I worked at was staffed mostly by teenagers (I was only in my 20s myself), there was always one guy that left me feeling a little uneasy. This is the story of my worst, and last encounter with ""Robbie"".

""Robbie"" was a pretty stereotypical ""rave kid"". Super baggy clothes, etc. He also was blessed with a dont-give-a-flying-fuck attitude. He was rambunctious, loud, a little crazy, but for the most part a decent worker. He worked in the kitchen mostly, so he'd have his music blasting and really didn't pay much attention to the rest of the goings on in the restaurant. It didn't bother us because he was actually one of our fastest pizza makers and didn't give us much shit.

Then one day, including ""Robbie"" and myself. I took a delivery order over the phone and it got sent to the kitchen. 2 large vegetarian pizzas. While I went about my business, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. Did I just see what I thought I did? No, I couldn't have. But just to be sure, I watched ""Robbie"" make pizza #2 a little more closely. Sure enough...*""Robbie"" was spitting on the pizzas!!!*

I LOST it (on the inside) and I dropped what I was doing and went straight for the kitchen. Wondering if he'd come clean about it, I pointed out that I had seen him do it. **TWICE!!!** By this point, I had seen something so repulsive I gagged (gagging a little now as I write this 10+ years later!) and I had been lied to, right to my face. Furiously I threw the pizzas directly into the trash and told him to remake them as I stood watch.

I don't recall if we fired him or if he quit before we had the chance, thank god), ""Robbie"" would spit on them because he assumed the pizza was for an East Indian customer.

EB: NO!! You need to *reserve* chickens nowadays??

Me: Well, most of them are pre-purchased and put on reserve. I'm sorry if this is an inconvenience for you, and we really should put more chickens out, but the boys have lots of work to do in the mornings and just don't have the time to stand cranking the spit.

--Now, no more than that. The chickens are brined for 4 days before they are cooked. What we make for the day is what is available, THAT DAY. Nothing more. And even if we just happened to have an extra chicken delivered that morning, it wouldn't have been brined and would've taken even longer to cook since the ones for that day had already been going for about half an hour. I explained this to EB in a simpler version.

EB: *scoffs* Well it sounds to me like the kitchen is lazy and doesn't want to do a little bit of extra work. How much does one more chicken take anyway?

--Protip: don't ever call kitchen staff lazy. They bust their balls for shit pay because they love their job. I know this and was already having a bad day

Me: In fact, to cook breakfast, lunch and dinner for YOU. One rotisserie chicken may not seem like a big deal to you but the amount of preparation that goes into it is enormous and takes time and attention. The boys in the kitchen have been here baking bread, pastries, sandwiches and hot meals to go for customers like you who didn't think ahead to put a chicken aside. I'm sorry we don't have one available for you but there is plenty more food for you to have for lunch.

Gather around, Sisyphus, and the physical detritus of human sin. It scarred my soul, and lifted the veil of youthful naivety from my eyes. It is the tale of the event I know only as “The Shitscalator”.
 	
It was the year 20XX. I was but a lowly cashier-slave bound to the will of the corporation that rhymes with “Holes”. Its business strategy is to soak the market with coupons until consumers craft the illusion of their thriftiness around their own eyes. The hour of my luncheon arrived
	
There was a grocer’s next door
	
The first thing that hit me was the smell: a hint of our usual store ambiance underneath overpowering waves of feces. There weren’t any customers on the floor, shivering, pale, and clammy. I had been working up the courage to suggest a date for months, so I knew that these were three adjectives that weren’t usually applicable to her. 
	
I requested information regarding her physical status: I.E. what was wrong, let alone someone I wanted to get off with. I gathered my courage, put the whole of it in a thimble, and strode towards the mechanical stairs. Fear met my heart, and they hit it off immediately. 
	
Have you ever tasted a smell? Smelled something so powerful that it starts invading your taste buds? If you had
	
It was a waterfall. That’s the only way to describe it. Drowning in diarrhea, causing globules of crapwater to flow down even as it was lifted up. At the bottom of the escalator, a living whirlpool of crap swirled and churned. Churned, like butter might. A row of crap handprints displayed themselves proudly on the wall next to the escalator, the flag of the pillaging conqueror flying high above the burning ruin of our village. 
	
I thought about being sick, and mechanically walked towards the elevators on the other side of the store. As I stumbled along, the store manager and the floor supervisor rushed by me, mops and safety cones held like weapons in their hands. They might as well have been fighting a dragon with feathers.
	
A short elevator ride later, until it suddenly swerved into the lingerie department, where hell’s ass appeared to have exploded. 
	
The crapstream then lurched out of the rubble of crap-coved bras and shitstained panties, for even one such as I knows when to abandon the fight. Venturing into a dripping shitcave, which I later learned was what the restroom had become, is literally the point to draw that line. 
	
I went into the break room and ate my lunch. ",self,t5_2t2zt,1359524049.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/17jcbk/the_shitscalator/

I was working at a small gas station.  The GM was a good friend of mine, and worked efficiently, regardless of the actual work.  Plus, as he put it, he knew I wasn't ""a goddamn druggy thief"".

I'd been working there about 2 months, and it was doing this wonderful mix of rain and snow that happens regularly in Wisconsin.  Slick as glass, and you'd be an idiot to actually travel in it.

It was slow for the first hour or so.  I had most of my side work done already (get it done early, and he said he'd be there in about an hour.  I started working the little front walkway with the shovel, and had intended to salt it, when a car pulled up to the pumps.

I headed back inside, another car shows up, and another, and another, etc.  It appears I'd have a small rush on my hands; no big deal.  Coffee was fresh, and full, I actually had a few pizzas out

I served a good 7 or 8 customers

Then

I've got a line of people at my till, with a general smile, some small talk for a few truck drivers that are our regulars, etc.  She marches up to the other register... the one with the 'CLOSED' sign in front of it.  She stands there for a few moments, and a few more people show up, and make the line longer.  She clears her throat and stares accusingly at me.

""Sorry ma'am,"" I said with a smile.  She glowered, stared ice daggers at me, and went to wander around the store instead.  Whatever, I'm busy.

Finished a few more customers, but whatever, it's winter in Wisconsin.

Finally, as well.  
""Why are you so slow?""  
""I'm not
""I almost slipped at the pump!""  
""Yep

Queue tirade about how the pumps should be clear of all snow at all times and should be salted and that she almost slipped and I shouldn't be making light of such a thing and I should go out there and clean that immediately and...

""Well,"" I say, cutting her off and motioning to the other folks behind her.  ""I'm not to be anywhere but behind the till when there's people on the lot.  Next, it's *winter* in *Wisconsin* and there's *rain and snow* everywhere... in fact, we're slated to get a good 7"" from this storm.

EVERY TIME. Many times someone stepped into my line after I flipped my sign and I promptly told them I was closed. 3 or 4 times the person told me that I was open when they got in the line. All I could do was shrug and say ""Sorry, I'm closed now"" and exchange a knowing glance with the real last person in line, who knew the truth since I let him/her know they would be my last customer. Thankfully they all knew they were lying and changed lines without a fight. 

Well I was going through the worlds largest retailer at around 11 pm. I had just gotten paid and my fridge was a wasteland, with one person behind me. The other line had three customers waiting with decently full buggies. The cashier then did something I would never do: Her supervisor came over and told her to go on break, so she flipped her light off and told me ""Sir, I'm closed"". I couldn't believe it. Without saying a word, I just stayed right there in line. After a minute or so she looked at me once again and said, ""SIR, I AM CLOSED.""  I said, exaggerated a little). I am already in your line, I'm not gonna check you out.""

I was pissed but it takes a lot for me to raise my voice, and then I just decided to leave my super full buggy right there and walk out.

1375806785.0,1jtiwt,But I drove 40 minutes to get here.,EtsuRah,314,44,41,"This happened last night. 

A couple days before last night a guy came into the tech dept looking to have the computer he built diagnosed. He put it together himself and the machine was not posting any kind of screen. I charged him 30 bucks for a diagnostic and then spent 3 days testing all of his parts to make sure everything was working properly. Turns out the computer case he bought was shorting out the motherboard. I call him and tell him the problem and that since he bought the case from us, he will do it, and he will be in to pick it up in a couple hours. 

So let me preface. $30 for a diagnostic is the cheapest price in the area by $100. If he had us put the machine together for him in the first place then he would be covered under us for any malfunctions of the computer. 

So he come in around 8 and says he wants a new case, we found the problem we did the job you paid for. Here is the conversation:

Me: ""I can't refund the diagnostic. We did what you paid for."" 

C: ""I buy from you all the time.""

M: ""So then you understand that my technicians get paid by the services you paid for. You will have made my techs work for 3 days to FIND the problem

C: ""Well I bought the defective case from you

M: ""No. It is ULTRA's fault

C: ""Well I want you to swap the parts out too"" 

M: ""For $30

C: ""I drove 40 minutes to get here

M: ""I did not say that. You choose to spend your time however you see fit. But this is a business

C: ""You're willing to lose a big customer! I was going to but 3 dozen PC's from you!"" (He wasn't. He is actually a regular

M: ""I'm sorry to hear that

C: ""I'll be sure to shop at (Online store that has no local stores

M: ""Well if you're going to speak like that in front of my coworkers

I then watched him huff and puff as he had to take the parts out of the case and put them into the new case with techs 10 feet away working on other stuff. 

I just don't get people and their entitlement. 

Also this happened after he threatened to return everything that he bought

I noticed it is always the people who don't spend a lot that do this crap and always expect to be treated like the big spenders, even if it means you aren't buying it from me.

**One, Four, FIFTH**

One fine day I am working at GDNickels.  My co worker Stacy and I are watching the cameras, and get other cameras in the area ready for me to take over should we need to quickly switch cameras.  

On Stacy's screen, who was shall call DAVE, after Dave Chapelle.  (So yes the title was a reference to his sketch.  You'll see why).  So Dave proceeds to rip off some tags from shirts and shorts.  He's wearing  baggy jeans, a baggy black hoodie, and a baseball hat.  He's glancing around, looking for people watching him, and plainly up to no good.  Dave then proceeds to enter the fitting room.  I make my way downstairs, and head to the fitting room.  Dave soon exits, so he shouldn't be an issue.

Sure enough, he starts to panick. I identify myself, he tries to dart away, I grab him. He's still trying to run away while I'm holding onto him.  So I grab  the hood in the back, yank him down, grab his arm, and use the leverage of his shoulder to force him to flip onto his back.  This is a very good technique that ""encourages"" the person to comply with your commands. If they roll over while you apply leverage, their shoulder is  cranked and it hurts.  It also allows you to control one of their hands and keep them from getting up easily.  Eventually Dave learns to just comply, and lead him back to the office.  

The whole time Dave is cursing at me, etc.  As I'm leading him in I explain why I stopped him, and that he's in the shit for trying to run, so he best just go along with it.  He keeps trying to pull away, make a scene in front of customers, etc. Anything to try and bully me into getting embarrassed and letting him go. 

Fuck that. I got you mother fucker.

So we bring him in the office, wallet, keys, phone.  Then I bring him into the second back room of our office, and make him remove the clothes he stole.  He starts saying I can't make him do that, that its sexual harassment. I only want to see his dick, etc.  I tell him he can either do it here, they'd be confiscated for evidence, and told Stacy we had a weapon.  Dave starts stammering its not and I quickly instruct him to shut up and not move, and quickly handcuff Dave again after I made sure he had nothing else on his person.  We are still waiting for the cops to arrive

The first question is obviously why he didn't tell us he had a weapon.  Dave is adamant that the brass knuckles aren't a weapon, he wasn't wearing a belt, despite needing one, as his pants kept falling down.  And the brass knuckles did had a metal piece at the bottom that looked like it was for sitting them into a belt.  I had seen buckles like these before, so it seemed like a legit story.  However we had to explain to Dave that while its a belt buckle, it's made so that you can quickly remove it and use it as a weapon. And seeing as he wasn't using it as a belt buckle at that time, it just didn't look good for him.

He had stolen 3 or 4 pairs of shorts, but the weapon charge would be what hurt him.  We finished our investigation and waited for the cops. Seems like we always caught people right before or after the 3 o clock shift change when it took forever to get any response.  Eventually one of the cops shows up, starts the paperwork, and we wait for the Sergeant to arrive.  Now this is a cop we all loved, and we will call Sarge.  Sarge was close to retirement, kinda riding out his last years, and a ton of fun to be around. He was all business when need be, he was a big jokester who always made us laugh, like with Dave

So Sarge walks in, which I will paraphrase here.

Sarge: ""HI Dave. I'm Sarge.  Listen.  My friends here said you gave them a hard time.  Now I'm willing to bet you were just panicked.  You seem like a good kid who just did a dumb thing.  Now you only stole about $150 of stuff, you can still apply for youthful offender, and after you pay them back, and stay good for a year, it'll be off your record forever,  However, the issue with these brass knuckles can get you into trouble.  Now its obviously a belt buckle, it's still a weapon.  Now you say you had a belt that got torn up so you threw it out?""

Dave: ""Yes Sir. At work earlier today. But the buckle was expensive so I didn't want to throw it out.""

Sarge: That's understandable.  Where do you work?

Dave: In the mall here. 

Me and Stacy exchanged glances. So THAT'S why he was so nervous about telling us.

Sarge:  OK. Listen Dave. You're detained right now.  You're going to be formally arrested and processed and probably released under Personal Recognizance.  But before we do any of that, or any of your co workers swear they saw you throw it out because it was ripped up, I wont charge you with Possession of a Deadly Weapon. So where do you work?

Dave:  In the mall.

Sarge: Where in the mall?

Dave: I plead the Fifth.

Sarge: No Dave you aren't under oath, and don't want your bosses to find out you were stealing from another store.  That's something you have to deal with though, because this is more serious. I'm not trying to trick you here.  So where do you work, so we can go get this sorted out.

Dave: In the mall.

Sarge: Yes. I know. Where in the mall?

Dave: I plead the Fifth.

At this point me and Stacy are cracking up.  We love when shoplifters play Lawyer and start quoting the law or judicial process. Especially since they are almost always wrong.  Sarge is getting testy

Sarge: Ok let me explain it to you again. I know you're nervous but listen.  (Sarge then explained how serious the charge could be and why he believes Dave but he needs the proof to throw out the charge. Also explains how pleading the fifth right now doesn't really apply and the basics of the legal process so Dave can fully understand.)  So, that you work?

Dave: In the mall.

Sarge: ::Facepalm::  Ok WHERE IN THE MALL?

Dave: I plead the Fifth.

I'd like to say this was it. But it went on for a solid 5 minutes. All of us just pleading with the kid to just co operate so he doesn't get in trouble. Eventually I pulled out the trump card

Me: Hey David. Listen. Normally I only do this for younger kids who obviously value the mall as a hang out spot AND lie to me when I catch them, get the charge dropped, and have to talk to your bosses about what happened, which may be bad maybe not. Or you can not only get arrested and charged with felony possession, but also most definitely lose your job.  

Sarge: So where do you work son?

Dave: The Mall.

Sarge: I think I know what is coming next

Dave stops, anywhere than on that bench right now, handcuffed, and bound.  He eventually looks down at his feet, and slowly breathes in and out, not saying a word.

Sarge: Where do you work in the mall son?

Dave: I.... I plead the Fifth.

Sarge stood up, a glint of hope in his eyes that wasn't there a moment before. You can see it. You can see this kid thinks he just won. That he is getting away scott free and won't have to face any of the consequences of what happened. What a lucky day.  Maybe he'll just go home. Or maybe his luck would continue and he would ask that girl Miranda from 4th period science to the prom.  With luck like this she had to say yes. Then he could go and take her out, and maybe get laid. YES! YES ANYTHING WAS POSSIBLE AFTER SOMETHING AMAZING LIKE THIS! I AM DAVID AND I AM A TEENAGED GOD!

So I remove the handcuffs, but I would love to be able to just watch his face over and over as it goes from pure joy to the hellish realization that he is fucked.  I swear if it was on video [you can actually pinpoint the moment when his heart rips in half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N65IJC5A5GM).

Dave begins to silently weep. Sarge reads him his Miranda rights. Dave keeps trying to talk to Sarge, Dave was led to the police substation we had at that mall.  We inform mall security, and they charge Dave with trespassing.  We eventually find out what store he worked for ( A skate board shop that rhymes with ""Zoobies"", and went and explained what happened.  The manager was very understanding, and glad we caught someone who would steal, even if it meant her employees.  She talked with mall security about having him come in for his next shift where they would terminate him. And sure enough, she showed us the trash can next to the register, torn black strip

1356117984.0,158pvf,More Adventures from a Former LP: The Time a Manager Literally Sold Me Out For A Sandwich...,Drunken_Black_Belt,357,88,29,"Hello once again TFR!  Today I will be telling you a story about the only manager I ever had that I truly hated

So this was early on in my LP career, the other LP guys were averaging 3-6 cases a year.  I was averaging that a month. And that is extremely low for most companies. But this company only cared about your greeting the customers, and making sure the receipts matched the items going out the doors, especially for large items like TV's.  Now several months before this incident, we received a new manager. From day one, me and her didn't get along.  I couldn't tell you why I initially didn't take to her. She seemed nice enough, just fake.  But whatever I could deal with fake people no problem.  Lets call her *Dakota*.  She was as large black woman, overweight

Or so I thought.

Now the main issue I had to come with this manager, along with another random female employee, would be forced to stay hours after everyone else, because Dakota was finishing her daily paper work.  LP always had to be the last one out with the managers, and if it was a male/female combination, then another female employee had to be there to ensure no funny business was going on.  So I would often sit an hour or two after the store was closed up waiting for Dakota to finish. Problem with this, was when you pulled up tape of her during store hours, or eating.  ALWAYS EATING. And when you talked to her

So late one winter night, everyone is getting everything ready so we can get out right on time.  In walk these two customers.  So I follow them on camera because they are literally the only customers in the store.  I see them approach our associate in the photo department, ask some questions, then pick up something next to the register in the department.  They then walk over to another aisle, and the woman places it in her purse.

Here we go.  

So I call a Code Blue (theft) on the radio, I will.""  I see her hang up and pick up a phone.  

Fine

So I'm still watching this couple browse the store, because I won't be able to perform a stop on them either way.

Next thing I know, but I can't verify what the item was, and my manager isn't letting me follow my steps, so I'm not going to be making a stop.  I'm not risking my job, even on a legitimate stop.  The cop says ok.  About a minute later the couple exits.  

Problem was that Officer Dipshit forgot to inform his partner.  His partner jumps out and attempts to stop the couple.  The man, thinking he's going to run, grabs him and puts him against the wall.  FML.

A few moments of confusion

*A fucking FREE sample of photo paper*.

They are pissed at first, this is the time that Dakota decides to emerge from her cave, and try to take all the glory for this apprehension.  ""Did you get them?  We don't mess around with that kind of stuff here!""  

I thanked the couple for their understanding, and locked the front doors and exit.  I immediately went to photos and talked to the associate as to why he wasn't responding to the radio.  Turns out he had taken the ear piece out of the radio, and plugged it into his iPod and was listening to music.  I then went to the LP office, and started burning multiple copies of everything. I knew this would be a huge issue, and I wanted to document it.  Dakota was still trying to talk to me about it all. Eventually I looked at her and just said ""I didn't make the stop, because you weren't there to verify it.  They didn't steal anything. The associate was listening to music on his earpiece instead of paying attention to the radio. Meanwhile where are you? In the office, eating, following prodcedure for a Code Blue.  Even if THAT hadn't happened, and keys

Dakota started in with ""I'm a manager. You're just LP you can't talk to me like that. You can't tell me how to run MY store. YOU made a bad stop and you're gonna pay for it."" Just picture that as a 5'2 Madea and you got the idea.  She then walked back into the office and started making phone calls.  I got everything together, and the regional LP manager.  By this time it was almost midnight, as we closed at 11 during the holidays.  But I wasn't going to get stuck with this bullshit.  I explained the situation to my Regional Manager, and he said to just keep everything for Monday, and he'd be in to talk to me.  

Monday comes around,Dakota, and the Regional Manager are all there.  They want to talk to me about the incident. Dakota has this HUGE shit eating grin on her face.  I would never hit a woman, but if I could have paid someone to do it for me, I'd have gladly given up my entire paycheck. My regional called me in, because somehow the footage I copied disappeared in my two days off.  Strange. Good thing I made 2 back ups and hid them in the office.  The look on Dakota's face was priceless when she saw me emerge with two more disks.  It took a few hours of questioning, and review, it wasn't my fault. Dakota was written up for failure to follow procedure

Dakota avoided me for a while after that.  But she would still try and find things to bust me on. Any little infraction she could find, as Dakota couldn't take as many food breaks now that she was being watched by the GM.

1374848544.0,1j3j8b,Be your own advocate,lasercatexplosion,318,54,19,"Earlier this week the Store Manager of my grocery establishment called me into his office and informed me that he had to write me up because I had called out twice in the last 30 days. He slid the write-up across his desk and waited for me to sign. 

This didn't seem right to me. I knew I missed a day last week because of a stomach issue, I don't want to sass you, but when was the other day you're saying I called out? I'm just pretty sure I haven't.""

He insisted that I had in fact called out at the beginning of the month (it was in the attendance binder that I had) and told me to sign the sheet so we could get back to work. 

I took out my cell phone and looked at my calendar from the last month. I input every shift I'm scheduled into my phone so it's easier to check

""Well, that was my one day off for that week because of the 4th. So, I'm sorry, but unless you're willing to check the schedule on the computer for that week, proving that I was supposed to work, I'm not signing that paper.""

He checked, I would get suspended without a week's pay.

So just a tip for my fellow retail slaves: Keep a record of your schedule! Make note of the days you call out! Because management will try to fuck you on everything they can. 
If I were five years younger I would have been too scared to speak up even if I know for sure that I was right.

At this point I'm suspicious because even among all the constant alarms that go off at work to tell people that fries


A couple of minutes later after I've gotten a couple of orders ahead of the car under control and, *ever* a poo poo head?). At this point I decide that these girls are going to jump through some hoops if they're getting anything (usually we just give out stuff if you seem like you might make a fuss and/or you're polite about it, but if you are being an asshole or have just been handed an absolutely enormous $30+ order you can probably afford the 50 cents extra for the onion rings you've decided you want instead).


**M**: Hi

**C**: A large burger X meal and a small burger Y meal with no tomato.

**M**: And were you looking to get that replaced or refunded.

**C**: Replaced please.

**M**: Okay


I go to the till where all the orders get sent and there's nothing in the last ten hours that fits.

**M**: Well

**C**: It was... you

**M**: Well I'm afraid that's wrong

**C**: Really? That was a girl? She looked just like you!


At this point my manager (who had been handing out orders all day until I got here and got quiet just after I arrived and unlike most other managers I've ever had is willing to call customers on their BS if he has to) has walked over wondering why on Earth this car is still here when it hasn't ordered anything.


**C**: Hey

**Manager**: What seems to be the problem?

**C**: We wanted our order replaced and he's not giving it to us!

**Manager**: So when did you come through?

**C**: About 6

**Manager**: No he didn't. There was a girl on then and I was handing out orders. I don't remember you.

**C**: You're lying to me and we're not leaving until you give us our food.

**Manager**: Well if you want food you're going to have to pay for it

**C**: Well we'll just sit here and hold up all your customers (the lights were off at this point and anyone else who came in was going to get told that we're closed)

**Manager**: Well I'll just have to call the police

**C**: We've been trying to call that all night!

**Manager**: Well if you'd done that it would have

**C**: We'll take this further!

**Manager**: Well our complaints hotline is _ or you can go into our state office which is at 123 Fake Street


Both the girls in the car sit in stunned silence for a few seconds.

This story is a bit different from my previous two

I was working customer service at the time and hating every moment of it. Most of the bosses I worked with would bend over backwards to take a return, since they walked in just slightly less often than unicorns. Besides, we'd have ended up breaking them anyways for the tantrum throwers.)

So, obese retail god that the next customer would just shank me and get it over with. Suddenly, looking over the crowd, I caught the glint of the fluorescent lights shining off the LP guy's pale bald head. I knew him reasonably well, and I knew that the only reason he would leave the lofty throne of the security camera room would be to surreptitiously shadow some ne'er-do-well. 

For some context, people had been buying little handheld tag-guns so that they could attach the price tags of things they had bought to old, worn out clothes, then return the old clothes for the price of the new ones. At the return desk we had a shiny new set of rules to follow to ensure that it didn't become a trend, and the LP guys were put on alert. 

Looking at LP guy, and rather frumpy if I say so myself, middle-aged woman. To help paint the picture further, imagine Dolores Umbridge if she was a mexican muggle. (Not Imelda Staunton, Dolores Umbridge.)

Given that I still thought that age brought class, if you would, a laundry hamper stuffed with two baby hippopotamuses. Two baby hippopotamuses suffering from the obesity epidemic. 

For further context, they were much lighter than their metal equivalents.

She stalked past me and Lex Luthor came skulking along after her. At this point I was distracted for some time processing different returns. 

About an hour and fifteen later, by the other exit. The woman working customer service with me was told to keep an eye on the door. (As an aside, I find this amusing in retrospect since the same woman was later arrested at our store.)

As we walked to the other side of the store, but when people are in the changing room that long it's generally a strong clue that they are either up to something nefarious or having hot exhibitionist sex.

Anyways

About thirty minutes later, and a chill ran up my spine. 

Señora Umbridge came walking down the pathway

Suddenly, can I help you for a moment?""

She said in broken English that she only spoke Spanish. Undeterred

In a burst of bestial strength, first in surprise and then to avoid the woman swinging the cart at him.

I had previously been considering going to stand by the door to deter her from running, as she was swinging a full cart two-thirds her size and screaming with every last bit of air in her lungs, I knew that she wanted to leave with the cart far, far more than I wanted to stop her. Mr.Broderick, the only winning move is not to play. 

Given that the way to the exit was unblocked by supervillains, screaming all the while. Everyone in the store watched her exit like a crowd might watch a missile burning through the atmosphere. 

In a screech of burning tires

Time stood still for a moment as she left the surly bonds of earth. Then, with her legs sticking up into the air, the car screamed off into history.

My customer looked at me and asked ""What the fuck was that?""",self,t5_2t2zt,1362089141.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/19eydo/lock_stock_and_a_cart_full_of_clothes/
1361018393.0,18mvwy,Racist biker fun.,FartingBob,369,103,185,"So i work as a assistant manager at a petrol station in England. We get many bikers on the weekend where we are and it is store policy to ask bikers to take off their helmets (or lift their visors if they use the older style ones that reveal the whole face) because our secutiry cameras cannot see their licence plates on the back of the bike. We have notices on each pump

So yesterday the weather was a bit nicer after a crappy month or 2 in winter so bikers are coming out more. 90% take their helmets off to fill up anyway (its a common policy in most stations around here so most of them know anyway). Most of the others are polite when they dont and we ask them to before they get fuel. But a handful are not polite. At all.

So anyway

As soon as i step outside he shouts (through his closed visor) ""Oh fuck off

Then he shouts in my face ""And what if a muslim bitch with those scarves fills up

I started to tell him that religious descrimination doesnt apply to bikers who dont want to take off their helmets and that the policy was recommended by the police (last year we had a string of bikers riding off without paying and getting an ID was very difficult because of our front facing cameras). He demands that i let him fill up because he is very low of fuel and wouldnt make it to the next station.

This is music to my ears. I tell him i will not be serving him at all because of how he was acting to me. He throws the pump on the ground and wheelspins out of the place with not a drop of fuel.

A regular customer was filling up on one of the other pumps at this time and i hear a few days later from her that after she filled up she was a few miles down the road and saw the biker standing on the side of the road with a bike clearly out of fuel. Awesome. Also knowing he had at least another 10 miles before he got to the next station made my day.

TL;DR: Be polite to the person who can refuse to give you fuel when you are running on fumes.",self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/18mvwy/racist_biker_fun/
