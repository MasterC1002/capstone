1)  I'm a fucking drunk.  Any of you who've drunk with me in person can attest that I will drink, will wake up, start drinking again, and blow a .15 late in the morning.  I'm not a young kid anymore, and I can't express to you enough how painful the hangovers are now.  They last 2, sometimes 4 days.

It's not much funny anymore to get shitshow drunk.  It's rather somewhat pathetic to see a 40-year-old man stumbling around

But I accept that I am

2)  I'm really quite functioning.  Hold down a decent job, great credit score, a criminal record so nominal as to not even scare away the fine folk in accounting (who, by the way, wrote me up with HR in my employee evaluation for using my pen too loudly at my desk).

But see

So, then the nightmares begin, and brother, I'm telling you, these are like worldwide Armageddon is totally my fault and my dead mother laughs at me for my failures type nightmares.  

So I don't sleep.  Then I go to work, and the anxiety attacks kick in.  I can't breath.  There is a weight pressing from inside my chest.  The sound of other peoples' keyboards incite internal paranoia that they're out to take my life away (and given the pen remarks, they just might be).

So this is my advice to you while you're still young enough to choose.  Either be a drunk or don't be a drunk.  If you're gonna be a drunk, drink 211, smoke cigarettes, and enjoy the ride as long as you possibly can.

But Jesus, but god damn is it not fun.  You'll spend 80% of your time stressed the fuck out and the other 20% of the time counting the minutes until you can drink and get away with it.

I'm gonna try really hard to spend the next ten years making as much money as possible, pay for that, then disappear from this corporate grid, cuz fuck shit god damn hell, the alcohol isn't going to kill me.  The anxiety of living amongst the teetotalling normals is.  Of this I don't joke.  It's seriously going to kill me.

I've got a liver and a set of kidneys made of god damn alchemy metals

""God

""What does your ex look like?"" he asks.

""Like Michael Fassbender,"" she presumably replies.

So, and he starts to feel inadequate about how much shorter and funnier-looking he is than I, but that's ok, because he gets to carry a gun to make up for having a small, misshapen penis.

We had a problem with gnats

He comes back later with a gym bag packed with liquor. There must have been 5 or 6 separate bottles. Needless to say, and and within about 45 minutes I chug a 375 of Canadian LTD. The guy who made the run (in his mid 30s, sort of up-tight and a staunch Republican) gets pretty sloppy fairly quickly and starts rambling about doing anal.

Suddenly there's a knock at the door. I open it to find our HR Director. I watch his eyes fall on the duffel bag packed with plainly visible distinctive paper-bag ensconced bottles.

He walks over to the duffel bag

And then says ""Thanks for picking this up

Sine moving to the USA I still order a beer with lunch. Just did this on a date with a nice girl and she was all like ""do you always drink this early"" (it was noon). 

Okay sure

Of course I had about 6 shots before even picking her up for lunch (and I am assuming you all realize this is barely enough to get me buzzed) and I order a beer as-per-usual with my lunch. 

Literally every male in Germany gets a beer with lunch...you would be looked at weird if you ordered a Pepsi. 

I used my German heritage to try and explain myself but shit. 

We need to change the social culture around here to accept this. It seems to me that any drinking before 5 (i.e. before work ends) is just unacceptable around here.

And it's not like Germany is filled with alcoholics. We probably have the same percentage as the states. But drinking at noon is the fucking norm. This needs to happen in America. It would be better for everyone.

The 86 Rules of Boozing:

1. If you owe someone money

2. Always toast before doing a shot.

3. Whoever buys the shot gets the first chance to offer a toast.

4. Change your toast at least once a month.

5. Buying someone a drink is five times better than a handshake.

6. **Buying a strange woman a drink is still cool. Buying all her drinks is dumb.** 

7. Never borrow more than one cigarette from the same person in one night.

8. When the bartender is slammed, in-and-out, super-chilled, half-and-half martini with a lemon twist. Limit orders to beer, straight shots, and two part cocktails.

9. Get the bartenders attention with eye contact and a smile.

10. **Do not make eye contact with the bartender if you do not want a drink.**

11. Unacceptable things to say after doing a shot: ""Great

12. Never ever tell a bartender he made your drink too strong.

13. If he makes it too weak

14. If you offer to buy a woman a drink and she refuses

15. If you offer to buy a woman a drink and she accepts

16. If she buys you a drink

17. If someone offers to buy you a drink

18. Always keep a corkscrew in your house.

19. If you don't have a corkscrew

20. **Drink one girly drink in public and you will forever be known as the guy who drinks girly drinks.**

21. Our parents were better drinkers than we are.

22. Never talk to someone in the restroom unless you're doing the same thing - Urinating

23. Girls hang out

24. **After your sixth drink

25. It is only permissible to shout ""woo-hoo!"" if you are doing a shot with four or more people.

26. If there is a DJ, do not approach him again.

27. Learn how to make a rose out of a bar napkin. You'll be surprised how well it works.

28. If you can't afford to tip

29. If you owe someone twenty dollars or less

30. **Never complain about quality or brand of a free drink.**

31. If you have been roommates with someone more than six months, so long as you leave him one.

32. You can sneak a shot of your roommate's liquor only if the bottle is cracked and it is less than $25.

33. The only thing that tastes better than free liquor is stolen liquor.

34. If you bring cheap beer to a party

35. Learn to appreciate hangovers. If it was all good times every jackass would be doing it.

36. If you ever feel depressed

37. Try a new drink each week.

38. If you are the bar's sole customer

39. Never tip with coins that have touched you. If your change is $1.50, you cannot give it back. To a bartender or cocktail waitress, small change has no value.

40. If you have ever told a bartender ""Hey

41. Anyone on stage or behind a bar is 50% better looking.

42. You can tell how hard a drinker someone is by how close they keep their drink to their mouth.

43. A bar is a college, wait for a staff member to clean it up, then blame it on someone else.

44. Being drunk is feeling sophisticated without being able to say it.

45. **It's okay to drink alone.**

46. After 3 drinks

47. Nothing screams ""nancy boy"" louder than swirling an oversized brandy snifter.

48. Men don't drink from straws. Unless you're doing a mind eraser or face eraser.

49. If you do a shot

50. Never brood in a dance bar. Never dance in a dive bar.

51. Never play more than 3 songs by the same artist in a row.

52. Never yell out jukebox selections to someone you don't know.

53. Your songs will come on as you're leaving the bar.

54. Never lie in a bar. You may

55. **If you think you might be slurring a little

56. Screaming ""someone buy me a drink!"" has never worked.

57. For every drink

58. Fighting an extremely drunk person when you are sober is hilarious.

59. If you are broke and your friend is ""sporting you

60. If you are broke and a friend is ""making sport of you

61. Never rest your head on a tabletop or bar. It is the equivalent of voluntarily putting your head on a chopping block.

62. If you are trading rounds with a friend and he asks if you are ready for another

63. If you are going to hit on a member of the bar staff

64. **The people with the most money are rarely the best tippers.**

65. Before you die

67. Never ask a bartender

68. If there is a line for drinks

69. If there is ever any confusion

70. **The patrons at your local bar are your extended family, and if you're really drunk, the mothers.**

73. If you bring booze to a party

74. **If you hesitate more than 3 seconds after the bartender looks at you

75. Beer makes you mellow

76. The greatest thing a drunkard can do is buy a round of drinks for a packed bar.

77. Never preface a conversation with a bartender with ""I know this is going to be hassle

78. When you're in a bar and drunk

79. If you're 86'd

80. Anyone with 3 or more drinks in his hand has the right of way.

81. If you're going to drink on the job

82. **There's nothing wrong with drinking before noon. Especially if you're supposed to be at work.**

83. The bar clock moves twice as fast from midnight to last call.

84. A flask engraved with a personal message is one of the best gifts you can ever give. And make sure there's something in it.

85. On the intimacy scale

86. You will forget every one of these rules by your fifth drink.

Some people are confused how a bunch of alcoholics that appear to be destroying their life can be so kind and supportive to each other.  To me, say we're destroying our lives, wasting time in a bottle, begging us to seek help, as if we want their acceptance.  

Now we have our own home and with our user count over six thousand, we define ourselves by our drinking.  We understand each other, and because of that we care about each other.  We're not bad people, we're just drunk people.  We're emotional people.  We're our own fucked up little family, and that's just fine with me.  

Cheers

We all said we'd check on him, you know? He had already hit rock bottom and was clawing the rocks trying to find out how much deeper he could go. 

He'd lost his job and was scrounging money for booze. There's no telling if he killed himself or if his body finally blew up internally.

Now he's gone. I'll never see him again

For me? It went something like this... 

When I first started drinking. I started drinking hard. It was right after my father had passed away. I was pretty much trying to be a desperate alcoholic

That phase passed. Normal life resumed. I met a girl

Then I started drinking once or twice a week. I went to the bar with friends

That was the thing to do at that age though. Go to the bar, pass out. I never was the designated driver because I was honest with my friends. I told them what's the point of going to the bar if I'm not going to get fucked up? They wanted the life of the party with them,  so they never bothered me about driving. That's what we did every week.  My friends and I gathered around alcohol every week. 

Gone were the days of casual video games til 2am. Now it was the bar til 2am and those drunken trips to Denny's I barely remember. I didn't miss the under 21 routine though. This one was much more interesting. 

Then one designated drinking night, I wasn't breaking the law. Just having a good time. 

Before I knew it. I was drinking every night I had off. 

But I wasn't an alcoholic. 

Life resumed, something small to eat, water, coffee, cigarettes. I still wasn't an alcoholic though. Those guys drink every day all day. 

Then one day my boss told me I smelled like alcohol. I was asked if I had been drinking. It was still early in the morning. I drank a ton the night before. I told him I had been drinking the night before

My friends didn't know how much I was drinking. Hell I didn't ask them how much they were drinking. Why would I? I wasn't bothering anyone. I wasn't in anyones way. I wasn't making any problems for others. 

I started to notice I was thinking of everything in drinks. If one of my friends suggested doing something I would always mention drinking or playing a drinking game. I started to pick out what people were drinking in movies and on television. I could tell you how to make anything mentioned in a movie. If I couldn't. I looked it up. Knowing I would try it when I could. 

I started to wonder if I was an alcoholic.  “No way.”

Then one day I woke up late for work. Really late this time.  I didn't remember much of anything of the night before. I checked my phone to see a few texts that read

I realized it was time to stop drinking on the weekdays. It was time to focus. It was Friday though! I wasn't going to waste the weekend. I decided I would stop drinking Sunday. I wasn't going to waste any drinking days. Again

Sunday came faster than a blink of an eye it seemed. I told myself Sunday was still technically part of the weekend

At lunch on Monday I started thinking about drinking again. I knew I shouldn't. I knew I couldn't afford it. Well I ended up stopping at the liquor store on the way home. I knew the people in there. I felt it was a safe place. I told myself just one more night of this. It was the last weekday I'd be drinking on for a long

Weeks passed and I didn't skip a beat. I got drunk every single night. Some nights I got more drunk than others, I told myself.

Finally I had that moment of clarity alcoholics always talk about. Maybe it took running out of money to eat

The first night I wasn't drinking I had no idea what to do with myself. I was so bored. I felt like I needed to treat myself for not drinking this night. So I went and got take out at a restaurant. I got home and felt very depressed. Anti social. I just wanted to be left alone. I didn't want to talk to any of my friends. I had no interest in anything. ""Fuck the world.""

My brain did an amazing job of letting me know it would rather be drunk. Every... minute... of... the... day. No matter what I was doing, listening to music, driving to the store, anything..

As I lied down to go to sleep that first night, or anything like that, because I never drank 24-7. I always woke up, drank my gatorade, coffee, food, cigarettes. You know

The second night was more of the same. Another twitch

The week seemed to drag on

I was on my fifth day of sobreity. My mind had finally cleared. I wasn't experiencing any pains, twitches, etc. I was super proud of myself too! Five days straight. Even more proud that I survived the boredom. Maybe this was the turnaround. 

Then I realized it was pay day. It was time to reward myself with alcohol. Hell


tl;dr: Piss.

This particular combo is my goto routine 3-4 nights a week. It's dirt cheap and packs a good whallop and gets me a wonderful 5-6 hours of unconscious bliss.

The Bud is $5.99 a sixer at the gas station down the street, steady pull. The last few drops are tasteless backwash, but, there may still be some alcohol left, so, doesn't matter. The can crushes nicely, lending a manly aspect to the brew. The first two go down within 20 minutes and now it's time for the EQ.

At $1.29 and 8.1%, it goes down quickly enough. After 15 minutes the EQ is kaput.

After years of bitter experience I have learned that I simply cannot have large bottles of distilled spirits around the house. I'm sure some of you can appreciate this

The airplane bottles of Jim Beam are $1.50 at the state run liquor store, the liquid is golden and rich. Paired with Bud #3, I sip some beer before drinking the shot. The shot is warm, serious, and tastes like a cross between heaven and NASCAR. When it is done, another good slug of the beer and it's time to relax and watch Family Guy reruns and 30 Rock instead of the political shit I've been reading on the internet all day. Why does sobriety make me believe that being informed and having an opinion means anything? Fuck if I know. Thank god for booze.

The third and forth Buds last a good hour or so and then it's time for another shot. Fifth beer lasts a good 40 minutes. I'm officially fucked-up at this point and much of the alcohol has yet to be processed and reach my bloodstream. I crack beer #6 and spend a long, I'm drunk and don't have shit to do or anywhere to go. Time for the final shot. 

All in all, ease of drink, drinking pleasure, and, most importantly, ability to put me down and shut my head off for a few hours.

I just want to say thanks to all of you for guiding me to the HFA lifestyle in the past year. You've brought me from someone who would beg his friends to buy him drinks at whatever bar they felt like going to into a person who's managing a bar

The story goes like this-

I had been unemployed for a long time

A week or so later I'm sitting on my mother's toilet (where I could get wifi signal to get on chat and talk to you fucks) and Val reminds me that I need to grab beer before last call. I realize I have enough for a drink or two plus package to go, and pretty dry."" 

He responds by saying ""Well where did you learn how to bartend?""

I say ""5 years working at a 70 year old bar

""I went to bartending college."" he said snidely.

""Did you skip the day where they told you an order on the rocks is 8 cubes and a double shot?""

""Where did you learn how to bartend?""

""At a 70 year old bar for 5 years. Jameson on the rocks is a man's drink, it's what men drink to get drunk to forget the fact that they're paying 7 bucks for this shitty pour.""

""What's your name?""

""Alex Franz. I live a block away.""

""I'm Jesse. Good to meet you."" And he didn't charge me for that drink and ended up buying me another.

Fast-forward 2 hours and 3 drinks on the house later

I raise my hand slowly and say ""I'm also unemployed!""

Jesse grabs me by the arm and drags me to the back patio where he informs the slacker bartender that I'm his replacement.

This is getting lengthy and we're all drunk. I ended up working with Jesse for a few months

And CA is the reason.

If Val hadn't told me to go get more beer because I was running out

Managing a bar, making more money than I can spend, having an amazing girlfriend who accepts me for who I am, living on my own in an awesome studio apartment (where any of you can stay whenever you want to.) I never thought I could be a high functioning fucker, but you all believed in me just as you believe in everyone. 

The point of this post is to say thank you all. I am so in love with all of you. I kiss my /r/CA chip every day and it's never done me wrong. 

TL;DR- Thanks to all of you. You helped me become a real person.

Last week

This weekend and every weekend after until the cold sobers us up, a celebration, a defeat, a night out, a night in, a Christmas, a Memorial Day, a Wednesday.

I got a promotion. Let’s have a drink.

I didn’t get the promotion. Let’s have a drink.

Alcohol is the prescription and the accepted response for all life’s experiences

We are born two drinks shy of happiness. Two drinks gets you to what feels like the natural starting line of life. It’s a warm restoration. A velvet womb. Easy

When you’re young, but just want to feel that way, prodigious bouts are retold by loved ones that hush when you enter the room. You start off drinking out of the bottle and at some secret point it starts drinking out of you. It’s not everyone, but it’s enough.

If you’re at all self-aware, or when living room drinking has retreated to the garage.

We all know someone, cove parties, love, marriage.

If he’s lucky, or adventure, or money, or sex, or the approval of strangers. He’ll still envy people who can have one glass of wine a night, but not as much as he’ll envy those who can have five. There are many who feel that as long as they are a functioning alcoholic, they’re not an alcoholic. That’s the sad logic of the besotted mind.

Not all alcohol consumption is bad

It’s Friday, and the party will go on. Most of the lake drinkers will be young and will survive the delicious pleasures of an unwise youth, but some will be those older drinkers carrying nervous kids with watchful eyes.

We still have a lot of summer left and a lot of beer. I just hope we, I feel gratitude and hope. For my fellow heavy drinkers, I fear most of us will tread water a long time before we’re hit with the illumination that means rescue.

We've come pretty far as a community

As we've watched, we've seen a show of love and support for a largely misunderstood type of person that one can't find many other places. We've offered love and condolences for each other during [bad times](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/tcxhf/mom_passed_this_morning/), and offered congratulations and love for those during [good times](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/p06oe/i_fucking_made_it_and_ive_got_ca_to_thank/).

We've gotten to know each other in many ways. From comparing our [personality types](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/10nhnq/breakdown_of_personality_type_thread_responses/) to more comical comparisons such as [places we've puked](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/10riu7/today_i_barfed_on_the_floor_of_a_cathedral_older/) and what we [*won't* drink](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/q0pik/what_is_the_one_drink_you_find_that_you_cannot/).

We've had [contests](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/q6txs/skuuzi_up_for_grabs_for_someone_in_the_us_or/) for the fun of it, showed off our furry [drinking buddies](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/skpup/hey_ca_can_i_see_your_petdrinkin_buddy/), gotten [tattoos](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/qpqay/ca_for_life_cheers_to_dune_for_the_design_which/)... Actually, [we've](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/xin1s/another_one_branded_for_life/) gotten [lots](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/tiv6j/the_less_bloody_version_did_dune_forget_to/) of [tattoos](http://www.reddit.com/r/lookatthisfuckingca/comments/10lhm0/bros/). And we even wrote a [book](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/tldkn/choose_your_own_adventure_ca_book/)!!

We've had our share of bad times. We've gotten sick. We've been depressed. We've had it rough. But through it all we have stuck together and supported each other and shown each other love that has kept us going and made us something more than a subreddit. It's made us a family. One giant drunk family. 

A family that keeps growing in both population, /r/drunkpoetryslam, and even /r/HelloIDrinkKThxBai!! We have a still booming [chat](https://www.icanhazchat.com/ca) and now our own [poker club](http://www.reddit.com/r/capokerclub/). We continue to grow in many ways. We come from all walks of life. From high functioning alcoholics, to those who are barely hanging on, but we all know when we come here that we are all in this together and have love and respect for one another, even when those of us need to [take breaks](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/z58rg/cas_and_moderationabstinence/). This is a place we call home. 

I would also like to give a special thanks to the chat owners and mods, but you guys certainly do it well. 

And another thanks to the sub mods, work, and efforts to keep this sub as helpful and homelike to a very rare group of people to make feel comfortable and welcomed. And of course, to Deighv, who decided to turn in his modding badge and gun recently. You are loved and missed, but we all hope you are doing well and are happy. Hope to see you around these parts again someday.

I'm just going to warn that this is (at least for me) where shit started to get downright scary.  The withdrawals got so bad I decided to do a 5-day hospital detox.  That didn't help and I relapsed.  2 days later I was back in the ER because my stomach refused to hold down anything

A CT-scan confirmed pancreatitis.  80% of that is caused by alcohol and it's not something to fuck with.  Great.  Admitted to hospital for 5 days

Did I stop then?  No.

I hallucinated out of my mind for days.  I can't even describe the intensity of these hallucinations but they were absolutely incredibly real and far beyond what I thought a ""hallucination"" would ever be.  Finally (oddly, and all was normal again.

1363725403.0,1am6s9,friendly PSA - intro to ecigs for dummies,,120,14,86,"Howdy yall.

Why am I making this post?

Well most all of us are heavy smokers, I could help alleviate both of those situations. Also I just plain' ol' take kind to yall. 

I've been vaping for about 3 years. The first 2 years are really shitty

When I started using ecigs I really had no one to talk to so everything was just confusing as all hell. Now that I got some worldly wisdom I figure I'll do myself a little community service and spread the good word.


---------------------------------------

""Okay dogg like alright but like what are the benefits of ecigs""

Alright

**1.) Mad cheaper**

I'm basically living out in the country, you feel money?

I'm gonna show you how to get started on ecigs (here on out referred to as vapes or personal vapes or some shit like that)

**2.) Well like I think they're healthier**

So... Uh... I breathe better? I don't know man I aint no med school doctor geek. The head doctor geek of the UK

On top of that

Just the nicotine, mmm-hm.

So what I'm trying to say is

**3.) It's the only smoking alternative that is enjoyable**

So I'm not trying to convince anyone to quit - but you totally could. I'm more so convincing people to subsidize. 

I picked up ecigs because they seemed interesting. I've been fucking around for 3 years with them. A year ago I finally found out the best way of vaping (I'll get into that later) and now

Now I prefer ecigs 98% of the time

**4.) Vape anywhere**

So like some states are passing some fascist ass laws

Yet if you're in an apartment or a home you can't smoke in

**5.) When you're rolling balls with your girl she won't be like ""OMG why do you have to go out for a cigarette??? You don't love me enough??"" even though you're liek ""Baby c'mon it aint like that"" and like when you're driving in the car and she's all ""Don't roll the window down! it's cold! omg your cigarette smells so bad!"" well you won't have no more of that**

Dude what's even with chicks never wanting the window down? Damn.

----------------------------------------

**What follows is the basic 20 dollar starter kit.** This is the one

A quick word before I continue: all cigarette-sized ecigs are not worth any of your fucking money, and you quit.

All those kits, man. fucking rip off. Shitty batteries, just, just shitty. Fucking shitty.

For my first two years I used cigarette sized ecigs and I'd just always give up one them and go back to the ports.

So these are the two things you need:

1.) [Starter kit- $13.00](http://www.vapedojo.com/collections/kits/products/katana-kit)

This includes a battery, the clearomizer is good for a month before it starts performing subpar.

This is called an ""eGo"" style battery. It has a 510/eGo connection

The battery is 650 mah so it should last all day for a new user and then you can charge it at night for the next day.

Make sure you read the back of the package

2.) [A bottle of juice- $5](http://www.vapedojo.com/collections/vape-juice-menu)

Damn

3.) A five dollar shipping fee....

Huh other websites have cheaper shipping fees? Still ain't bad. Ships fast.

The website the previous links are from is VapeDojo. VapeDojo is good people

Two of my friends have had either the battery or the clearo break after the two week warranty expired

Good folk.

I'd like to take a moment to say that I in no way represent any vendor in any way. I mean you guys know me so that's not necesarry to say, you know?

-----------------------------------------------

""Wahhh I don't want that one it's too big!""

The katana kit I linked you to

I mean


-------------------------------------------

**The following are three vendors I like.**

Since it is an infantile industry and technology

 I do NOT represent them in any way but they're who I send my friends to. They all have great customer service

1.) [ivape](http://ivape.net/) for parts (toppers

iVape is my bread and butter. They're who I get my [clearomizers](http://ivape.net/index.php/Cartomizers/eGo.html) from. I fucking love their juice but there's a cheaper place for juice.

Vape Dojo also sells clearomizers, I guess, it would be simpler to just buy off one place but I'm just saying, you know.

Notice how all the batteries and clearomizers say eGo or 510. That's the connection type you have. It's the best

2.) [VapeDojo](http://www.vapedojo.com/collections/all-ego-batteries) for [batteries](http://www.vapedojo.com/collections/all-ego-batteries) and [clearos](http://www.vapedojo.com/collections/clearomizers-and-tanks)

**the cool thing about vapedojo is everything they have is eGo/510 style so you don't have to worry about getting a mismatched battery/clearo**

You're already paying five bucks for shipping so you might as well toss another battery in there. Like I said, in case one dies when you're out and about or one to vape when the other is charging.

The battery I use is another eGo sized battery. It's calledthe eGo twist. It's the same type and size as the battery in your starter kit

When you buy your starter it's a good idea to buy another clearo and a new battery... Wait actually it would be cheaper to just get another katana kit


3.) [Mount Baker Vapor](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/electronic-cigarette-nicotine-juice/) for juice.

Far as I'm concerned

Everyone loves the fuck out of mount baker vapor. They make all their shit in america

You can get a 50ml bottle for $10.99. That's fucking huge

Make sure you get 24mg nicotine. Anymore than that might be too much

---------------------------------

**Handy websites**

1.) /r/electronic_cigarette

Fellas there treat you kind. All sorts of sidebar info for newbies

2.) [Vapor Joe's](http://vaporjoe.blogspot.com/)

This guy doesn't work for anyone

-------------------------------------------------

Well uh I kind of wrote that like shit? Maybe it was a better idea in my head.

Whatever. **If you guys have any questions or shit ask me

Cheers.

-------------------

Edit: holy fuck that is a wall of text. I don't think anyone will read that.... I wonder if the judge will count this as community service.

------------------

**A quick note for non-Americans**

Customs and borders are funny about ecigs and stuff

-------------------------

**Water**

Vaping


------------------------------------------

**Cost analysis**

Disregarding batteries since they last about a year.

Clearos:

Average four bucks. Last

4/28 =

0.14

Juice:

11 bucks for 50ml. I vape a lot, and I stand by that, since when you start out vaping you prolly won't vape 1.5ml a day, and honestly, I'm probably in the 0.8 - 1.5 range so I took the high estimate.

11/33.33 =

0.33

0.14 + 0.33 = 0.47 a day in running costs

0.47 * 7 days a week =

**$3.29 per week.**

So... Yeah... That ain't bad. 

In reality I splurge and buy extra juice and stuff so for me it's probably about 5 or 6 dollars a week.

I am writing, finished my novel. But that's not the small victory, that's just life.

MY small victory is that when I have to pee, I pause, and consider whether or not to piss in the drain or to walk the 5 extra steps and piss in the toilet. 

I piss in the toilet every time, and I'll be damned if I'm going to piss in a drain when there is a toilet nearby.

But I can't do that, and your society says I can't  get drunk and do that too.

Sunday evening and I'm doing what us fuckers do best, the kind of knock that sounds like the door is probably propping up the person on the other side. Hesitantly, I get up and go to answer the door fearing the worst. To my surprise a red faced, drunken Chinese man falls into my room and declares his need for booze, women and anything else in between. 

Now In my drunken stupor I identified said red-faced Chinese bloke as a guy who lives in my apartment block

I sit this geezer down and he notices I'm on chat, weird shit happened and we got kicked off chat. 

""We Go Bar""

Alright, ""I PAY EVERYTHING!"" Awesome. 

Mr Chow and I proceed outta the apartment and take a stroll down to a little wine-bar-can'tmakeit'sfuckingmindupifit'sapubornot sorta place, It's busy and I wanna get drunk, so I buy us 2 beers each and a bottle of some shitty sugar water tastin' cider. Bear in mind, we were both already shit-faced, so 3 drinks in at the bar and I'm already feeling buzzed; in the dimly lit bar, I noticed that Mr Chow has a face redder than a fuckin' tomato. He heaves a sigh, shrugs his shoulders, there no girls here""... Now I drunkenly tell him that I am the MAN when it comes to picking up women (I'm definitely not) and decide to take him someplace else. 

The next establishment is decidedly more classy than the wine bar, I protest his innocence but the bar keep says we've both had enough. 

-At this point

So Chow and I find ourselves on the terrace outside the bar, and decides he is going to go over and talk to her. Now Chow's command of the English language is fucking shocking at best, like seriously..he can not speak English to save his fucking life. I know at this point, whatever follows, is going to be embarrassing, so I drunkenly decide that I am now German and have no idea why Mr Chow acts this way, and also

I haven't learnt German since I was in secondary school, I might just be able to pass it off. So there we are, German Tidder, Mr Chow tomato face and old ugly hag who looks old enough to be my grandmother. I move closer and listen into the conversation, it goes a little like this: 

""You Come Drink With Us""

-He points at me-

(Fuck now I'm involved and she is speaking to me)

""Hey what's your name?""

""Tidder""

""Where are you guys from?""

-I make a grand show of pointing at myself and in my best retard voice say- 

""I coming from Deustchland

They buy it

Things seem to be going well, Mr Chow isn't content with just talking, it's time to make inappropriate, rapey sounding comments apparently. 

Mr Chow - ""I PAY £5000 YOU COME BACK MY BED""

Cringed so fucking hard I choked on my cig, as has the gathering crowd of smokers, I try to read her face but fuck I'm drunk. 

""How about we go for a drink first?""

What? This mongoose of a woman has seemingly decided to take him up on his offer? I have no idea. Next thing I know, I have to avert whatever drunken debauchery is about to happen, not for her sake but for Mr Chow, I mean..she's literally 50 years old and the whole situation is fucking embarrassing. 

So we get back to bar number one, Mr Chow has gone full snoop. 

This crazy Chinese fuck decides to cause a scene, we got thrown out. 

I'm thinking now is a fucking brilliant time to go home (God this story is proper long innit?) but Mr Chow isn't fucking done. He hasn't got a wife yet. Or whatever the fuck he wants. ""We go town"", and a taxi actually arrives to take us on a voyage of fuckuperry. 

-The next portion of the night is a complete fucking blur so I'm not even gonna attempt to articulate it here-

Boom, Mr Chow has become a fucking beetroot, the guy looks like he ate that gum from Willy Wonka, I take this as meaning he has probably imbibed enough alcohol to kill a horse. I'm in no better shape. As I stare into his partially closed eyes, we silently confirm, that indeed, we are both drunk as fucking shit. A voice breaks the silence. ""That'll be a fiver mate."" Mr Chow hands over a tenner

Mr Chow is enraged. He decides the Taxi man is racist, but not before Mr Chow unleashes a fucking Bruce lee Karate kick to the side of the car, much to the taxi blokes dismay. 

Anyways, but he's having none of it, we're stood in the middle of the road like 2 fucking bafoons, trying to block a taxi man driving off, whilst Mr Chow repeatedly tries to kick the fucking fender. The dickhead revs up, and to basically ensure neither of us die, I physically drag angry Chow to the apartment. 

Fuck knows what happened next

I asked my housemates where Mr Chow was and they told me he'd left to get a plane back to China. 

I'll miss that fucking guy.

1363784267.0,1anrlj,"Hello, r/CA! Let's have a little chat.",ceciliaxamanda,113,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/1anrlj/hello_rca_lets_have_a_little_chat/

Once upon a time, and some just plain ridiculous. I miss those days. No one seems to be able to find any joy in their lives anymore. And if that's you, well, I'm sorry. But you can still try to find some little glimmer of light in your life, whether it be maintaining just enough sobriety to get to the interview of that job you really want, or scraping up enough change to get an extra can of 211 for the night. Both of those are good things! So there's my first request - look for the little things, I'm sure you'll find something.

My second request - please do not come to r/CA for legal advice, that DUI you think you might get tonight, or anything else. As a legal professional, I ***strongly*** advise against getting legal advice from Reddit in any capacity, but especially do ***not*** ask for it from r/CA. You're just getting someone else's experiences, and laws vary from city to city - if you have a situation in which you may need to seek legal advice, do just that. There are resources available in many jurisdictions to provide limited counsel or general advice in most situations. 

My third request - it's not a pissing contest, and judging someone for just how much they drink is wrong, yeah? Yeah, it fucking is, this is fucking CRIPPLING ALCOHOLISM, a group for people who accept their lifestyle choice and don't want to be interrupted by underage, weekend-warriors posting about puking at the beer pong tournament they had when Ricky C's parents went to Aruba last summer! Judgement works both ways - you may have been shamed by someone for drinking too much

My fourth request - if you have a medical situation that genuinely worries, everyone is made differently. What may be no big deal for one person could be the difference between life and death for another person. And in that same vein, don't come here just to ask for help and then just respond with ""Nah, I'm just gonna ride it out, see what happens."" That is attention-seeking behavior, and it's exasperating.

My fifth request - do not come here to ""fly a sign"", that sucks and I'm sorry, but try taking it to /r/randomactsofpizza or something like that. This is not /r/randomactsofbooze.

Nicole was a beautiful Italian girl, while Angie was a more ""ethnic"" Italian, big nose, swarthy, funny as fuck and she loved men in a similar fashion as I did.  

We lay like drunken newborn kittens on our outspread blanket. Nesting in each others' hair, we knew it and we didn't care.

We hung out the rest of the concert, shiny and slimed with the alcohol that seeped from within was tan. He was a shitshow.

I'm making three types of post:

* '[Ethanol and its effects on the human body's Hormonal System](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/vzzzq/cas_and_nutrition_ethanol_and_hormones)'

* 'Ethanol's relationship with Nutrients

Please note that I have absolutely zero background in science, please do so in the comments below. Also, I strongly urge that no one ever takes anything I say as medical advice nor information, but rather just as my own personal thoughts. There is obviously a clear difference there, and it is very important to me that this difference is understood.

---

**Ethanol**

[Ethanol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol) - the 'drinking alcohol' - is the psychoactive drug that we all love/need to imbibe

Besides being psychoactive

**Calories**

A Calorie is a measure of energy. What we call a 'Calorie' is actually a 'large calorie' - written as *Cal* or more commonly as *kcal* - which is a measure of a thousand 'small calories' (written as *cal*).

One large calorie - or

On a gram by gram basis

* 1 gram of Fat = 9 Calories

* 1 gram of Protein = 4 Calories

* 1 gram of Carbohydrate = 4 Calories

* 1 gram of Ethanol = 7 Calories

and

* 1ml of Ethanol = 5.5 Calories

So

750ml x 0.4 = 300ml Ethanol

300ml x 5.5 Calories

1650 Calories

**Alcohol Metabolism**

It's important to note though that whilst human energy sources are measured in Calories

Typically (and in layman's), as well as Glycerol and Free Fatty Acids, etc, with their levels increasing in proportion to the amount of Calories consumed. When there is an excess of Calories consumed, that's when the body mashes the excess together and stores it as Fat ([Adipose Tissue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue)).

Ethanol

First, mainly) switches to as its primary energy source. That roughly means that other energy sources (e.g. F/P/C) will not be used till all of the Ethanol has been metabolised, if they are used at all.

Secondly, it's first metabolite (what it's broken down into) - [Acetaldehyde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetaldehyde) - is… and, relative to alcohol, I've read that it's ~30 times more toxic.

But

Ethanol is broken down by the enzyme [Alcohol Dehydrogenase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_dehydrogenase) into Acetaldehyde.

Acetaldehyde is toxic, and it will fuck their shit up. It causes nausea, vomiting, headaches, dizziness, confusion, fatigue, memory impairment

Luckily, such as Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) and Vitamin C, to deal with the Acetaldehyde (hence why these vitamins help with hangovers but, more importantly, this a reason for why CAs can incur a deficiency in these vitamins).

But

Acetaldehyde is broken down by the enzyme [Acetaldehyde Dehydrogenase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetaldehyde_dehydrogenase) into Acetic Acid.

Actually

I've mentioned what it does to the body. If you're familiar with [Alcohol Flush](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_flush_reaction) (e.g. Asian Flush/Asian Glow)

This is commonly seen in Far Eastern Asians due to a 'defective' [allele](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele) or absent [isozyme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isozyme) of (at least) one of the aforementioned first two enzymes responsible for alcohol metabolism.

Most commonly this is a problem that is found to lie with the *second* enzyme involved - Acetaldehyde Dehydrogenase - thus meaning that the Acetaldehyde is not metabolised fast enough into Acetic Acid, again causing the aforementioned (relatively rapid) rising accumulation of Acetaldehyde.

The long-short of it is that, this typically leads to a lower rate of alcoholism amongst those affected by this reaction… though, in my own experience, it rarely ends their night.

If you don't suffer from these reactions but want to know what it all feels like, it hangs around for far longer and in far larger quantities (~750% larger) than it would normally. With these drugs in your system (I *believe* a dose of Antabuse is effective for up to 12 hours, Temposil for up to 8 hours), and after an exposure to Ethanol, you should start to feel very hungover within ~15 minutes. Personally, I think these drugs are dangerous and change nothing within the mind of an addict, but if you are thinking of quitting they *do* help some people… you'd have to be a masochist to take such drugs on the regular and still drink

Anyway

**Ethanol --&gt; + Alcohol Hydrogenase --&gt; Acetaldehyde --&gt; + Acetaldehyde Hydrogenase --&gt; Acetic Acid (aka

[Acetate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate) is harmless

Whilst the above all occurs at the liver, which all (just like the Liver) sustain damage by doing so. 

Note: besides the enzymes I have listed above

Whilst it is commonly assumed that the liver can only metabolise *x* amount of alcohol over a set time as standard

Back to Calories… like I said, end up as Fat. It, however, remains the body's primary source of energy, thus entailing that any other present sources of energy (e.g. F/P/C) maintain their 'excess' status until they are dealt with.

Less than 5% of Ethanol Calories *can* end up as stored fat

Net result: if your diet solely consists of Ethanol Calories, you will not gain weight.

However: if you add in other energy sources, or it will simply be passed as waste.

Also, drinks like sugary cocktails or beer or whatever are far more likely to cause weight gain than drinking low sugar alcoholic drinks like wine, or (basically) nil sugar alcoholic drinks like straight liquor.

1341187656.0,vwepu,Why you need to go to Korea.  Place is made for drinkers.,stupidlyugly,97,8,37,"Most of you know I spent a stint living in Korea in the 90s.  This is probably the definitive place that started me down the road to true alcoholism.  I *thought* I drank before I went to Korea.  Things changed...a LOT.  

My apartment in Korea was 180 square feet and not considered small.  Nobody stays in at night.  

Let's describe a typical Saturday.  And by this, and since you don't pay rent in Korea, money really isn't a problem.  All prices are mid 1990s prices, so inflate accordingly.

Let's start with a Korean baseball game.  I was a huge fan of the Pusan Lotte Giants.  Now, nudge, wink, wink).  But as it happens, there are hundreds of little tents right outside the stadium selling juice boxes  of soju for about a buck fifty.  You buy several of these and shove them in your pockets, down your socks, down your pants

You go into the game

OK.  Game's over.  Get yourself a bottle of Aspa at the local convenience store.  Stuff is essentially liquid caffeine and nicotine for $2.50.  It helps get you through the long night ahead.

Time to hit the beer bar.  Now, and many have 10L containers with little spigots.  You HAVE TO order food in the beer bar.  They won't serve you otherwise.  Consider this a $10 cover charge for your table.

Bars close at midnight in Korea (wink, nudge).  Beer bars will kick you out.  Thing is, it's perfectly acceptable to buy alcohol at 7-11 after midnight.  So you've got a few choices here.  Sometimes, 7-11 will set up tables and camping stoves right out front.  You go in, buy soju for 50 cents for a 375ml bottle (22-25%abv) and a bag of frozen sliced meat.  You sit outside 7-11 drinking and cooking and having a grand time.

Orrrr, and amazing drinking food for $5-10.  If you get to know the lady running the soju room, you eventually get up and take bottles of soju out of the fridge yourself and she charges you based on the number of empties at the end of your stay.  If you puke on the floor, she'll get pissed and hit you, but won't cut you off.  You're just making room to spend more money with her, right?

Orrrr, and each one will have a food specialty.  My favorite had roasted duck on a stick for $10.  Soju is slightly more expensive than soju rooms, but not much.

Fucking hell!  It's 3am!  Where to go now?  The Karaoke, so you get one appropriate to the size of your party.  This will be the most expensive venture of your night.  They serve beer and whiskey, no soju.  Beers ran about $4 and whiskey was several hundred.  Girls LOOOOVE going to the Karaoke late at night.

8am!  Time to go!  You walk up the stairs from your basement Karaoke, you're already at) to the incoming fishing boats.  They'll sell you live fish right off the boat.  They kill it, put it in a plastic bag, and you walk it across the street to one of the sushi restaurants.

The sushi restaurant will take your fish

You're drunk and hungover at the same time.  The sun is up, when you hit up a seafood restaurant and some soothing, soothing rice wine.

Hit up the beer bar Sunday night, cuz fuck $100 a bottle for that shit).

Keep in mind that you never have to worry about driving.  The subway runs until midnight (it's common to see businessmen passed out and/or puking on the subway at night)

•	10/16/2012 1:50AM Thinking about my dad, but they made the choice.  I wished right then I could show him that, let him read the man who wrote in almost poetic fashion about holes in his socks, a trash can full of glass bottles, his half drank 6 pack and the one that awaited him after. 

 I read about things I hadn't taken the time to consider and realized that we would never have any talks like that.  Never will I ever just accept his choices and not put the guilt on him.  I will never be able to joke about it with him and share a laugh about how he’s wrecking his insides.  He knew well he couldn't be himself.  His self wasn't good enough for anyone.  No one would accept what he was or what he chose to do, they would only want to change me. Just like I wanted to change him.  But people don’t change because you want them to, they change because they want to.  Anyway, we all go out kicking and screaming and its an odd thing to sit and wish I could tell my dad I am ok with the thing that killed him, but that is what I find myself wanting to do.  Of course it isn't just about alcohol, it’s about him and loving him and supporting him no matter what.  

It’s weird because the people we love, which can put incredible distance between people.  If we just let that go, supported them and accepted them maybe that’s what they need instead of a wagging finger.  Maybe that would be more effective than ripping a picture down and replacing it with a beer can.  Chalk it up to another lesson learned.

**Withdrawal**

For dealing with specific [withdrawal symptoms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_withdrawal#Signs_and_symptoms), to ask the sub directly.

If you need to withdraw, and is absolutely no joke.

You should also be aware of [Kindling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_%28substance_withdrawal%29#Alcohol). This is a phenomena that, and with the symptoms appearing sooner and harder each time.

My advice would be to determine that average, starting with the average intake figure on day one, over the following 10 days.

Thus, 27 on the next day, 24 on the next, and so on, until you reach zero on the eleventh day. The aim is to space your drinks out throughout the day. Saving 24 units for when you go to bed is a terrible idea. You drink your dosage when you *need* to, throughout the day, or you don't drink it at all.

Once you have tapered to zero, and may only be extending your withdrawal, due to these drugs' cross-tolerance with ethanol via the [GABAa receptor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAA#Examples).

Please keep good nutrition during any withdrawal

**Abstinence**

r/CA is a great sub for support if you are looking to take a temporary break. 

However

On Reddit:

* [r/StopDrinking](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/new/?sort=new) - a recovery group sub.

* [r/Alcoholism](http://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/new/?sort=new) - a resource/info sub.

* [r/RedditorsInRecovery](http://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/new/?sort=new) - like a mixture of the above two

Outside of Reddit

* [Sober Recovery](http://www.soberrecovery.com/forums/)

* [Cyber Recovery](http://www.cyberrecovery.net/forums/)

For IRL support

* [Smart Recovery](http://www.smartrecovery.org/)

* [Save Our Selves](http://www.sossobriety.org/)

* [Life Ring](http://lifering.org/)

These are two support groups that are not abstinence-focused

* [Moderation Management](http://www.moderation.org/)

* [Sinclair Method](http://www.thesinclairmethod.net/community/) - Note

Finally

* [HAMS Network](http://hamsnetwork.org/) - lots of good articles to read.

* [Drugs.com](http://www.drugs.com/condition/alcohol-dependence.html) - anecdotes regarding alcohol dependence medications.

* [WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/drugs/condition-996-Habit%20of%20Drinking%20Too%20Much%20Alcohol.aspx?diseaseid=996&amp;diseasename=Habit+of+Drinking+Too+Much+Alcohol&amp;source=3) - similar to the above.

---

**Medications**

There are some specific medications that you may find help with moderation and/or abstinence:

* [Naltrexone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naltrexone) - Opioid receptor antagonist. Proven efficacy with reducing impulsive/binge/addictive behaviours, I believe it is soon to receive FDA approval in the US so as to be indicated for gambling addictions. Also, don't forget the above mention of the Sinclair Method - subscribers to this type of moderation claim that Naltrexone is best used *alongside* exposure to alcohol. Important note: due to the mechanism of Naltrexone's opioid antagonism, opioids/opiates will lose their efficacy *dramatically*. If you suffer from chronic pain and rely on opioid painkillers to manage it, then Naltrexone is not for you. Also, Naltrexone is not alcohol specific, and you may find yourself experiencing less excitement or enjoyment of certain activities (such as gambling or eating

* [Acamprosate (Campral)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acamprosate) - NMDA receptor antagonist. Specifically used to help maintain alcohol abstinence and with proven efficacy. Campral is sometimes given *during* withdrawal so as to reduce symptoms (with mixed reports regarding its efficacy). There are many recommendations for its use as an augmenter to Naltrexone for those suffering from other addictions alongside alcoholism.

* [Disulfiram (Antabuse)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfiram) and [Calcium Carbimide (Temposil)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_carbimide) - These drugs block the enzyme [Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetaldehyde_dehydrogenase), if they expose themselves to alcohol they will suffer from extremely unpleasant effects. Temposil is usually recommended over Antabuse due to its reduced sensitivity (alcohol is found in many places besides the bottle) and shorter length of effect (I believe 8 hours vs. 12).

Those are the major drugs used for alcohol abstinence. However

* [Baclofen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baclofen)

* [Topiramate (Topamax)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topiramate)

* [Ondansetron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odansetron)

* [Clonidine (Catapres)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonidine)

---

**Moderation**

Many CAs will tell you that moderation is impossible. It might be for yourself

Here are some tips:

* Switch to lower ABV drinks and/or dilute your drinks with water (or any other non-moreish liquid).

* Avoid buying rounds for your friends; avoid your friends buying rounds for you. Drink at your own pace.

* Put limits on your cash.

* Don't do shots.

* Avoid mixing in stimulants, cocaine. These only mask how drunk you are, and when they drop off so will you.

* Don't drink on an empty stomach. If possible

* Determine a personal indicator for when you've had too much

* Whilst drinking

* Always keep a low ABV drink in your hand. This may help fend off higher ABV drinks.

* Try new drinks; avoid drinks with which you have a history of passing out from.

* Set yourself a task for the next day that'll require you to be functional. Use that as motivation to pace down your drinking whilst drinking.

* Keep an eye on the clock.

* Get a prescription to [Naltrexone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naltrexone).

* Keep yourself busy with things like: Sharing moments with someone you love. Enjoying great music/TV/films/fiction/non-fiction. Trying something new. Taking up old hobbies. Making exciting plans. Keeping good nutrition and hygiene. Exercise. Getting good sleep.

* [A good thread for other moderation tips](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/rbtcw/a_good_way_to_moderate_intake/).

Well this morning I thought about another lovely facet to our morning routines. I can only call it the ""The Fuck?"" event. When you see evidence of something you apparently did, even with video evidence, what you are seeing can not be explained by reason or rationale. 

This morning started like every other: Wake up feeling groggy, get ready for work... Only this morning, after getting ready for work, I walk into the kitchen, look down at the dog bowl, and literally said ""The Fuck?"" out loud. The bowl was not only filled with dog food, but was also filled to the brim with water. The food was a soggy

I think life would be far less interesting without these moments. Who really wants to wake up every day and not have something to question?

**My backstory:** Heavy drinker since 18. There was always some problems because of my drinking (blackouts

I made 1 honest attempt while living with her to stop drinking completely. It lasted 45 days

When she moved out

**Hearing about Naltrexone:** I decided to get my first physical in 4 years in February. I figured I really needed to get my liver function test. I told the doctor I drink 50-80 drinks a week. He said if I keep it up

**Deciding to go on Naltrexone:** I was on a particularly great bender in late March. 5 days straight of 20-30+ drinks a day. I tried to taper down on my own. I had a seizure on night 3 of tapering. I guess I didn't drink enough. This scared the shit out of me since I live by myself and I really don't want to die. I knew I don't have the willpower/desire to stop drinking completely

**The doctor's visit:** Since he already knew how much I drank from the physical

**Week 1:** I didn't notice any changes the first 2 days. The third day something weird happened. I was on my 6th Beast Ice and had finished half of it. I suddenly lost all interest in finishing it. I poured it out and just went to bed. This has never happened to me before. 
The rest of the weekdays I would plan on getting super drunk
The weekend came and I drank a lot but nowhere near the level I used to on weekends. I didn't blackout and the withdrawal on Sunday was really minor.   
-I think I ended up drinking like 70ish drinks that week.

**Week 2:** This is when I began noticing *BIG* changes. For one thing my hands stopped shaking. I forgot what that was like.
I drank 4-5 drinks a night most nights. Finishing a drink became harder and harder. I had to mentally commit to it. There was a night where I only had 2.5 drinks.
When the weekend came I only had like 10-20 drinks each day. My tolerance was notably down. On Sunday
-I think I had about 50 total drinks this week. 
 
**Week 3:** The trend continued. I was only drinking 2-3 drinks a night. I even went 24 hours without drinking. 
The weekend came and I was surrounded by my heavy drinker friends. I only ended up drinking about 10-15 drinks a day. On Sunday I decided to not drink.   
-I think I ended up having 40ish drinks this week.

**Week 4:** This is present day now. I didn't drink on Monday. I don't plan on drinking tonight or tomorrow. I think I will end up drinking Thursday and this weekend.


**Side effects:** The needle they use for the injection is a big mother fucker. It made my butt sore for the first few days. Around week 2, that made it very painful to walk. These are all possible side effects that are listed on the paper you get with the injection.    

I have also noticed some not so serious side effects. I lose interest in smoking cigarettes and eating meals halfway through. It takes longer to orgasm during sex. Sometimes I don't even get a happy ending. The orgasm thing isn't nearly as severe as when I was on Lexapro. On Lexapro

**Future:**I plan on staying on Naltrexone for the next few months at least (maybe longer). I am going to talk to my doctor about switching to the pill instead of the injection. This is mainly because the lump in my butt thing scared me and I don't want to go through that scare once a month.

Drinking is still fun, I don't have to drink anymore, I haven't blacked out, and I generally feel like I am in better health. I plan on still drinking, but I don't really want to go back to the 12-24 drinks a day range.

I might make a toned down version of it on an open platform like google if there is enough demand for it. One thing you could probably do is download http://www.openoffice.org/download . That's an open source platform you can use and my guess is that it'd work for this.

Last night I'm hanging out with my roommate playing Dark Souls and drinking vodka tonics, I'm saying screw it to the tonic water and just chugging the vodka. It's around 4:30 a.m. and I'm starving. I go to the fridge and all I see is fucking vegetables and eggs. Any sober/healthy person would be delighted at the sight, but I'm sick of it. I want something unhealthy.

Now I've been really good about drinking and driving. By that

I drove to McDonald's. In my drunken stupor, hash browns, the whole nine yards. Everything is fine until I'm driving back home and I hit something. It was a huge fucking rock in the middle of the god damned road. I hit it so perfectly that it dented the inside of my rim. 

So the tire pops and all I can think of is ""I'm going to jail"". It's dark as fuck out and I'm drunk

About 10 minutes into it

The Sheriff Deputy helps me change the tire (which was a real pain in the ass). We bullshit a bit and I'm just being friendly

Upon arriving at my house he tells me he knows I'm too drunk to drive, he says. I thank him profusely, shake his hand and he drove off into the sunrise.

I dodged a huge bullet last night. I already have a DUI from about a decade ago and this guy really put things into perspective for me. I'm seriously never driving drunk again. I can't afford to and I couldn't live with myself if I hurt someone. That

1374012921.0,1ig0as,I raise my glass to nonjudgmental doctors,brainguy,87,6,41,"Like many of us I have a palpable fear of doctors and what they will tell me. I know what I am doing is destroying my body and I've always tried to avoid lectures from teetotaler doctors about the 'dangers of alcoholism' and especially considering some of the horror stories I've read on this sub about how doctors have treated CAs whom have been honest I have been afraid to see a doctor and be honest with them about my drinking habits. As such

Well, it's very responsible!"" So after I pissed in the cup she takes me into the nurse's office where I am to have blood drawn and in the last second before she leaves me with nurse I magically overcame one of my fears and blurt out ""Do you think we could also check my liver enzyme function?"" She seemed a bit confused as to why and asks me to come back with her to her office and talk, I oblige.

She starts asking why I would want these tests and I decide fuck it, so I tell her ""I drink way to much."" She probes a few questions and I answer, I still low balled it, ""~10 drinks per day"" I tell her, but that's a lot more honest then I've ever been in a doctor's office. She asks me some other questions about my psychological health, if I have occupational troubles, and my physical dependence; I show her my shaky hand and she feels it. All and all she is very calm, kind and most importantly to me, as I absolutely refuse to see a head doctor and would never participate in a program such as AA. So we leave on good terms and she lets me know she will contact me in the future to discuss the results.

Fast forward to today, she doesn't tell me 'what I *have* to do'. She says this is what the tests say and asks me if I have a plan. She also tells me she has done some research on the treatment I told her about (she even had a journal article from The New England Journal of Medicine on her desk; bonus points) and agrees the data looked promising. 

I tell her I will not have a plan set out by the end of the discussion as I need to mill over what these tests mean and what I want to do. She informs me if I'd like she can ask around to see if she know any doctors on my insurance plan that have utilized the Sinclair Method just to speak with them

So by the end of our discussion I tell her, the normal level this would indicate there is at least less long term damage to my liver. She agrees that is a good next step but does not pressure me to do it by any specific time. Before I leave she tells me regardless of what I do about my drinking she'd like for me to come in when I get another dose of the HPV vaccine I decided to get (which would not normally require me to see her) because she'd like to see how I am doing.

So that's where I'm at

There's no real point to this post but I needed someone to tell. Perhaps it will inspire some of you to get your shit checked out and if you do I hope so much you find a doctor like her. As always,,False,self,t5_2s68b,False,,True

For those who still aren't sure what happened, which did absolutely nothing to help the pain. I was then wheeled into the ultrasound booth so they could check out my organs.

It was the worst pain ever, grabbed the sides until my knuckles were white and cried for a while. After the life was taken out of me. Another friend showed up for a bit and we talked and she dropped things off for me, along with some advice I don't really recall. The owner of the Pub I frequent came by as well, but I was pretty much useless for the first few visits.
The following night was a constant battle of trying to find a med that worked enough to kill the pain. Eventually they resorted to Hydromorophone, convinced a doctor to allow me to do it 4mg every 2 hours. I was pretty much useless during this time, and every time I woke up in my room I seemed to be in a different place. All I could do is push a button and ask for more medication.

Come Wednesday the pain had died down and I'd begun to be somewhat lucid. I'd tapered myself off the pain meds so I could realize what was going on. Doctor told me I could start on clear fluids (the day before) but I refused to start until wednesday. Had loads and loads of visitors that day (thanks everyone!). Later on in the day I acquired a very annoying roomate, removing my chest monitors and getting the fuck out of here.

Sorry for not letting everyone know sooner. Nobody really knew many details

Additionally, but I will be getting a second opinion.

The Doctor was good, he was shocked. Today I told him I was getting a bit moody and anxious and had trouble sleeping.

He said ""Oh

I said ""No, woken up constantly by patients who just scream, machines beeping constantly, and having no idea when I'm going to leave. Not to blame either of you, but this is why I'm a little on edge.""

He laughed and said ""Sounds like you're back.""

  Her: “What kind of flavored vodkas do you have?”  

  Bartender: “Oh you know the usual

  I chuckled to myself as she ordered her flavored vodka with soda water.  I even considered buying her the one drink but I probably shouldn’t buy a drink for someone who thinks one drink is a lot.

I was 22 and just out of college. Got out of a bad relationship and began drinking heavily daily to medicate myself as my life hadn't been going according to plan. I didn't graduate college with a lucrative job, gaining a DUI in the process and losing the respect of my family leading to 3 years of them bailing me out of the life I had created for myself. 

Sure I did the classes and the rehab and paid all the fines, I'll drive myself"". Boom. Driving on suspended and more lawyers fees/court appearances. 

I got lucky and only received a month and a half extra suspension on that and no jail time. Seriously

We all know the risks and worry about things like probation or possible jail time but it runs much deeper than that. We know that you can kill someone with a cavalier attitude of being behind the wheel after only having ""a couple drinks"". Yes, and fines are taken care of. The years of dealing with bills you've run up and not being able to move around freely. Knowing you let down the people who love you the most and the feeling of helplessness adds. I missed the funeral of someone I loved very much and who had raised me because I am now barred from Canada. Yes, a whole fucking country will not allow me to cross the border because one night I let vodka take the wheel. Anyone here thinking of driving after a couple, please reconsider. Anyone who isn't dependent to the point where driving to the liquor store before closing because you **KNOW** the morning will be filled with vomiting and shakes because you don't have a drink, please reconsider. The last thing I want to do is be preachy but with the number of posts I see asking for help, I think everyone needs to take a step back and not focus on the short term and look forward to your future.

I've been unemployed and living on mom's couch for the last two fucking years. One month ago I got a call for an interview 80 miles and a ferry ride away from here. Had to get my 76 year old mother to drive me there. She doesn't drive so well outside of the quiet little town she lives in and it was hard on her. Almost got t-boned and rear-ended several times because she drives so slow

10 days later they offered me the job, I didn't hold out hope. Got the good news yesterday. I promised myself I'd quit drinking if I got the job (mainly because I really didn't think I'd get it). 

The company has a stellar rep in the industry and treats its' employees very well. The job is easy as fuck, I am my own boss and only answer to someone 800 miles away. I get medical, dental, vision, life-insurance and a **matching** 403b. The last time I did this kind of work, I had over 250 units (I'm a HUD 202 Senior Living Manager btw) and a lazy, incompetent maintenance man. This property only has 38 units, the property is in excellent condition and the maintenance man is one of those ""proud as fuck about my work"" guys. 

My mom is going to sell me her loaded 2005 Toyota Camry and front me the money for an ignition-interlock and SR-22 insurance. Since I'll have close to zero living expenses, eating food, sleeping, and, god-help-me, not feeling like shit and having the shakes all the time.

Since all I own is a few dozen button-down shirts, the two-bedroom apartment will be completely empty. Not even a bed. I am actually looking forward to re-building my material life by making deliberate and thoughtful purchases instead of just buying dumb shit all the time and filling a house with it like my wife and I did in Alaska.

Foreigner is playing on the radio.  It brings back memories of going to work parties with my dad and watching all his coworkers get fucked up on Budweiser and Marlboro reds.  It harkens back to a time when adults could still be adults

As a child growing up around drunks, super affectionate to me.

My grandfather used to drink beer all day, “Go on a mercy mission for me,” which meant I was to ride to the neighbor’s house, retrieve a beer, put it in the basket, and bring it to him.

Grandpa was never ashamed to drink around me, making sure to splash every puddle, to the bar, where he taught me to shoot pool when I was 6.

Early Madonna on the radio.  Getting sexed up on chat.  Horny

I’m giving music recommendations.  I’m drunk.  I hope they like it.

At this point, seeing the whale in the delta.  Glen Frey was popular then.   My grandma was alive.  I was a  happy adolescent.  She died, and I died with her.  Ever since, I’ve struggled.  People taking from me.  Car dealers.  My wife.  

I just died in your arms tonight.  It brings memories of parking my grandmother’s car shortly before she died.  She was a skeleton.  Jaundiced.  My mother wouldn’t let me kiss he for fear the cancer was contagious.  I didn’t get to go to her funeral.  The dogs lay on her grave.  I hate my parents for not letting me go to the funeral.

The steel gray sky meant good striper fishing.  My grandpa, and I have a picture with me thrusting my arm in the air to prove it.  

There was a jogging trail by my house.  I used to go running on it with my sister.  I remember 1986.  She told me about the end credits to Ferris Bueller’s day off.  The song.  She liked it.  She comforted me

Heartburn.  It hits.  Tears for Fears playing.  I remember being a hacker in the 80s.  _____ _____ paid me a visit.  My dad had no idea why this Russian dude was coming to my house.  We’d conjoined in a software pirating venture

Huey Lewis.  This brings memories of my waterskiing days.  The women.  In their mid-30s.  In bikinis.  Stressed over stretch marks.  Me trying to control the boner.

* The problems you drank to forget are still going to be around when you sober up. I can't even begin to fathom the amount of debt I have after ignoring mounting medical and misc bills for the last 4 years.

* Some of your friends only ""like"" you because you are someone to drink with. These people suck and I can say wholeheartedly none of my friends on this sub fall into that category so... thanks!

* You are a different person when drinking. Notice I say ""when drinking"" and not ""when drunk"" because I'm not referring to the stupid and insensitive shit we all do when well-sauced but rather the personality that drinking regularly cultivates. I'm trying to deal with understanding the ""new"" me as I find myself reacting differently to many things now that I'm sober.

* Your body does not recuperate quickly. I still have shaking hands randomly after 4 weeks

* ""You don't know where the line is 'til you've crossed it"" -HST
The good doctor's words imply something else to me in this setting. Once you cross that line into full-fledged physical dependance to the point of being no where *near* functioning

I'm gonna cut this off before I start rambling more. I have shit to do this afternoon. Above all else

Last night I walked down to Bar B to see if I had drunkenly left my jacket there the other night (indeed I had). I passed a table where some bearded German guy who worked there was sitting. I had met him the other night and grilled him about Kraftwerk and Einsturzende Neubauten and was probably pretty annoying.

He was sitting with some other dude and I joined them for a beer. Turns out the other dude is the owner of Bar A. First I told him how much I liked his place

Fast forward an hour or so, and she only had 4 or 5 drinks at this point, so my girlfriend got very worried.  All of a sudden she starts having a seizure.  My girlfriend calls 911, and about a half hour later an ambulance shows up.

Now this is in a major city, so already it is getting off to an ominous start.  The EMTs put her on the gurney, and the whole time are laughing at her, saying they can't believe anyone would let themselves get this drunk, and that she should be ashamed of herself.  My girlfriend explains that she only had a few drinks and has a history of seizures, and also that a guy she didn't know had given her a drink.  They blew my girlfriend off, told her that she wasn't having a seizure

At that point a police car pulled up

They arrive at the hospital and the doctor is just as disrespectful as the EMTs.  He makes the same disparaging comments as the EMTs, but that was the only thing he did that could even remotely be considered medical care.  

They keep her overnight for observation, and the doctor says that he didn't give her one, ""because we get girls who can't drink responsibly all the time, and it would be a waste of resources to screen all of them.""

Yesterday I tried to save my friend and roommate from losing his car. It got towed for expired tags, trying to get it out, but it's lost now, they charge by the day, a shitton.

We get home and its consolation time, always have. I pick up spiced rum for me, cookie dough vodka for him, mixed with mountain dew. He's happy, and I'm glad cause I thought he'd be depressed for days. And that's the last thing I remember. 

Wake up this morning in a self made pile of disgust. Roommate's gone. Phone's battered to bits. Shit everywhere. Blood on my knuckles. He wouldn't hurt a fly, flickering in and out of my conciousness. I recall he admitted he had thought about suicide, and I got pissed as fuck. But that was earlier, and I told him I'd lost too many friends already.

Shit. This hasn't happened in years, how did this happen, what did I say, is he okay, how to I get a hold of him, is he coming back ever, I have most of his stuff, he might have gone back to his ex wife. A stream of conciousness thunders through my head all at once

I take a shot to steady my nerves, the less and less chance he's ever coming back. He's one of the best men I've ever met, an if I beat him in a confused rage out of a loss of control, I could never forgive myself. Last time this happened, I dried out. Went to AA. Not religious. Only made it 9 months before I went back to the bottle, hard. Lost my girl to it. It was the drink or her. I wish the decision had been harder, I really do.

Now as the sun goes down over the trees, just waiting, begging the empty house, the walls themselves to make him come back, to explain, to let me apologize. I feel like a domestic abuser, like I should be thrown in jail

Dude couldn't pay his advertising bill but he liked me so he kept me on and paid me in cash. 3 nights a week I would get in my shitty Chevy Cavalier and go to Sonic and get the biggest vanilla dr pepper they sold and go to work. 

I make no illusions to be Paul Oakenfold, pop an hour long mix in and wait. I got to sit at the bar alot and at first they were stealthy about giving me a drink here or there but eventually even though I wasn't CA status or drinking to get drunk they just put a bottle of vodka under my cd tables in the booth knowing I'd bring in my huge soda from the drive thru.

We were a misfit gay bar. One that played a lot of punk and 90s (duh it was the 90s) electro bullshit. Prodigy was big. So was Cake

I'm not a fag hag. I just like people of all kinds. I liked these people. After the bar would close the old queen that ran the place would do lines

* If the number of days you've spent sober in the last month takes more than one shaky hand to count

* If you don't wake up hungover often enough to be surprised when you don't

* If you haven't precisely determined the number of airplane shooters it takes to get through a shift at work adequately without drawing attention to yourself

* If you don't have a barely-controlled level of self-loathing over your drinking habit

* If you don't have to seriously *force* yourself to *not buy booze*

im so wretchedly hungover because I don't drink enough to not be.


I like reading about everyone els'es shit lives when im hungover because it makes me feel better.  If you want you can read this but you dont have to because I'm going to ramble.  because it makes me feel better. 


I am jealous of my sister.  She \works her jobthing from noon to 5pm everyday make just enough money to pay for her studio apartment, and one day its really gonna fuck them all over.  Not us though, we're pros.  She's been hospitalized twice in the past 3 months for booze, once because she got blacked out drunk and thought a walk would be good, and ended up passed out on train tracks.  Cops found her and called it a suicide attempt which really pissed her off.  Also they ripped her favorite hoodie during her revival process and she was pissed as fuck about that too.  Now she doesn't go outside anymore. 


For my birthday she took me to see Doug Stanhope and because I was poorer than her she bought me 6 whiskey ginger ales that night.  She ordered them all at once becauyse the line to the bar was riciculous and the bartender just assumed she was ordering for her whole group.  It was magical. 


I dont think she's ever been hungover.  She absolutely hates puking because she thinks its a waste of alcohol.  She will sit there green in the face clenching her mouth shut trying to fight the urge.  Usually she wins but once she puked all over the back of my car.  I was taking her into the wild for camping and she found the bag in the backseat with all the booze in it.  After she puked I pulled over and she stumbled out of the car and fell into a ditch.  It was full of cow bones.  I discovered the freshly purchased 5th of tequila was over half gone, without a chaser the whole drive.  hOw did I not notice that?? she lost one of her shoes in the ditch but we carried on.  She went camping the whole weekend in 1 shoe.  ruined her favorite socks that weekend.  She'd never gone camping before, or since and she fucking hated every minute of it.  She was in the same graduating class as Kevin Federline's little brother.  Britney Spears came to the goddamn graduation, which neither of us attended, because we were getting drunk at Caleb's gravesite, the kid who hung himself on the baseketball hoop in their gym at school.  Neither of us had ever talked to Caleb before but he soprta became our unofficial hero after the nerve to do such a thing.  Shocked the fuck out of so many people.  We used to drink at Caleb's gravesite a lot.  haven't in years.  Probably because she refuses to leave her apartment now, except for the liquor store or work, but she pointed out that it just ends badly

Please note, and on what I've read. It is important to me that this part is clearly understood.

To reiterate: this is **not medical advice**. Please

---

But, and you've haven't yet seen a doctor.

There are a few things that need to be addressed first.

* 1) What colour is the blood? Is it typical [blood red](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematemesis)? Or

If it is the latter

* 2) How long has this been going on for? Have you developed any other physical symptoms? If so

If it's been going on for a long time and/or you have other symptoms alongside (particularly unusual ones), but try to use your best judgement).

* 3) Are you also shitting [tarry blood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melena)? If so

* 4) If the blood is typical blood red, apart from that coughing blood part - see a doctor).

---

Okay, and it's of that typical blood red shade.

To put your mind *somewhat* at ease

* erosion and/or inflammation and/or strain

of your

* stomach and/or oesophagus

caused by too much

* alcohol and/or [NSAIDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAIDs#Classification) and/or vomiting.

If you vomit a lot (like, or you drink a lot… or any combination of these… you are putting your [GI tract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract) under serious strain. These factors, especially when aggravated by other habits (e.g. your diet), can lead to the vomiting of blood.

---

Common [causes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting_blood#Causes) of CAs vomiting blood

* [Tears in the oesophagus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallory-Weiss_syndrome)

* Erosion of the stomach and/or oesophagus

* [Acute Gastritis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastritis#Acute)

Other (more major) causes might be:

* [Peptic ulcer(s)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_ulcer#Classification)

These are serious

Whilst a lot of these [symptoms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_ulcer#Signs_and_symptoms) can (and do) result from the aforementioned more common and/or minor causes of vomiting blood (such as gastritis)

-- Stomach pain

-- Bloating

-- Nausea

-- Frequent/heavy vomiting

-- Loss of appetite

* [Hepatitis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis)

---

I should stress here that these causes can eventually be fatal

---

However, then these are some tips regarding your lifestyle and how you can perhaps alleviate the issue (assuming it isn't one of the major causes that I listed):

* Start taking a [PPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor). Most I know recommend [Omeprazole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor#Examples). Depending on where you are in the world, it sounds like you are).

* Once you start taking a PPI, Pepto), etc) as you will most likely only cause more damage than good. You *can* take an Antacid alongside a PPI, but it is best to leave about four hours between taking each type of medication.

* Try not to vomit. If after 24 hours you still feel the need the vomit

* Avoid putting anything else besides medication (as said

* On that note

* If you have to drink alcohol (due to psychological compulsion and/or physical dependence), try to taper down your drinking *or* substitute alcohol with an appropriate dosage of [benzos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Alcohol_withdrawal).

* If you have to eat

* Avoid eating fats and fibres (incl. vegetables, and condiments).

* Avoid eating anything greasy, acidic, seasoned, pickled, etc.

* Do not drink soda nor coffee nor juice

* Avoid caffeine or any other type of stimulant (nicotine, etc).

* Thus

* Do not take an [NSAID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAIDs#Classification).

* Avoid taking tablets. Gel caps are your best bet.

* Try and take a multivitamin and cod liver oil (as gel caps).

---

If you do all of the above, then again, to repeat it one more time: please seek out a doctor.

That's all I'm going to cover. This is a serious medical issue

My post-breakup *rendez-vous* with alcohol turned into a three-year marriage. It started out fun

It didn't take me long to become a regular drinker. I had probably been drunk a dozen times before I started drinking every other day. Oh, she doesn't lie to you. She's got the burn, the taste, doesn't pretend to be what she isn't. She's ethanol, and she tastes like it. She's instant gratification; she burns you the right way. I know the good vodka, the finest vodka, the best deal for your dollar vodka, the shit that gives you hangovers, and you aren't that far-gone

Okay, where'd that bottle of wine go? *Fuck it, go get vodka.* It's cheaper and more bang for your buck. But it's Tuesday. *Kristen, when has this ever worked?* How many times have you sung this song? How many times was it pleasant to listen to? You’re not even a good singer, but you are bored and lonely and you think too much. Just drink until you’re as good at singing as you are at…whatever you’re good at. You'll figure it out later.

I did figure it out.

I've always been a binge drinker. Always. Once I pop, when I get asked to drink in afternoon, and they laugh. It's funny. I'm funny. But they don't know the truth of it. Those two beers are going to give me a slight buzz, but a slight buzz is nowhere near where I need to be. And that need is going to take precedent over anything else for the rest of the day, anything productive, anyway. Maybe I'll play some Spades, if I keep a handle on it, I'll fuck, however, and my vessel for desensitization has become an enhancer. Once I pop

Then the hangover.

The hangovers! There are so many kinds. People don't realize the range of hangovers one can experience; one being someone who drinks so much they classify their hangovers. There’s the simple headache, I will dry heave at least three times once I wake up. The drinking and crying hangover results in a puffy face and a hazy mind. And a headache. “Holy hell, how am I not dead?” equals vomiting, nausea for a couple of hours afterward, and not much movement for the entire day. My personal favorite is the “I drank as much water as I did liquor”, the mental hangover, where the mind is so hazy you can’t navigate through it. Not a lot of thinking goes on, it spews the other way regardless of the type of hangover); it can spew so much that you submit an epiphany you had about drinking to r/cripplingalcoholism. For every McDonald’s Dollar Menu item you eat, much less drink it? Yeah

Okay, though, and throw a couple extra days of sobriety in there. That means I have been intoxicated (drunk), on average, 350 out of 365 god-given days per year, for over three years. Whoa. Wait! Make that 348.2 out of 365. I forgot that April in 2011 where I sobered up and exercised…but did I end up drinking on the weekends…Hmm…Whatever. *Wait*, that was over two years ago? *Shit…*

I decided I was going to try another one of those months of sobriety a week ago. My friend’s 21st birthday was the epic night of drinking that triggered both a “Holy hell, I had 2 vodka cranberries, 6 vodka tonics, 2 shots of vodka, and some tequila shot over the course of 4 hours. I had eaten next to nothing all day. Shortly after my final drink, I argued with the birthday boy, threw up in the bathroom, only after I had started to cry. I do not remember any of this. I started to dry-heave in the bushes, Ronald McDonald. Yes, said this was the most drunk she had ever seen me. Then again

I didn’t make it 30 days anyway. I made it 6. The one time I decided to sober up for myself, and I couldn’t make it a week. I feel bad all. of. the. time. And my friend vodka, at the very least, is contributing to it, if not the culprit. After three days of anxiety, sleeplessness, and nausea, painting, but I’m not. I went to a party, otherwise I would have stayed home). Instead of staying at the party until 11 pm

I’ve been writing this like it is a joke to me. It isn’t. And I know it isn’t funny to anyone reading this. I have less than 5 years of heavy drinking under my belt, their dignity, their life. Some people can drink every day and be unaffected by it. Hell, drinking in moderation is good for you. An apple a day keeps the doctor away? How about ‘a glass of red wine keeps your health in line’ (we should make that a commonly-used phrase). There is a genetic basis to this, and I am one of the lucky people with this predisposition. Addiction stole both of my parents from me. My mother couldn’t smoke crack-cocaine in moderation, so she quit. My father and his brother couldn’t drink alcohol in moderation, so they both quit; his other brother is dying of alcoholism. If I am acknowledging a pattern in my twenties, and why would I continue to tread these murky waters? My life has only started to unravel, and the best things about me fade a little more with every drink I consume. They’ll be gone along with the plethora of wonderful things and people in my life unless I eliminate one thing. Just this one little thing. My source of pleasure, melancholy

But I don't know where to begin. And forever is a long time.

That was a week ago.  I'm now fully embracing those maudlin memories.  My grandfather died ""after a long illness"".  Dude stroked out and cacked it.  My grandmother, it was getting as many of his possessions out of her sight as quickly as possible.  For us, it was trying to get her shit-faced enough to sleep alone in the same bed she'd shared with a now-dead man for the past thirty fucking years.

Somehow, had shitty midwestern brunch and all gathered back at grandma's place.

I don't know how it happened

We set about it with a passion.  And a thirst.  Apparently

That Bottle.  The one that had been sitting there for as long as any of us could remember.  The one we were never allowed to touch on pain of grampa bending us over and whipping the shit out of us.  Grampa's Cherry ""Brandy""

Mason jar, dumb asshole never tasted it.  As one, we looked at each other and then we decided that the youngest oldest brother (me) should be the one to walk back upstairs amongst the bereaved to fetch glasses.

I'd like to think I did it with a modicum of dignity.  Probably not

Fucker couldn't do it.  That shit was stuck tight.  It took two dudes on the cap and two on the bottle proper to finally crack that shit.  And once they did - man.  The smell was...thirty year old homemade fermented cherries.

We poured, we grimaced.  All of that threat of pain and that dumb old fuck couldn't have just drank this bullshit himself.  Or tossed it at a passing alley cat.  Sweetest, shittiest drink ever.

I'm not here to play out some long sob story, eggs, and asparagus this morning in a beautiful haze. I hopped off chat with people I love or got kicked for some reason but none of that matters. What matters is what I saw upon truly waking.

I had a long talk with my mother(who I have in the last few years had to move back in with) about my brother and his passions. He is a doctorate student

But it was a civil conversation over me having breakfast and her having opinions. It was our own special kind of talk since they are few and far between. 

We talked of his aspirations, I felt like a real person for once. 

After the talk, smoking, and looking out on the great winter ""wonderland"" that my town had become over night, a strange and all too comforting calm came upon me.

Life may have it's ups and mostly downs, with smokes in my pocket, booze in my fridge, food in my belly, and a song in my heart over how beautiful the simplest pleasures may be. It's not often that I feel this, nor often that I long to live: but as I lay my head back down to sleep, it feels good to know that I have a community(albeit online) of people that accept me for me, and place no judgement upon me.

I didn't decide to quit drinking yesterday, but well, I guess now it really hits me. 

I feel great. That sickness, the feeling like something is wrong...it's all gone. The world is suddenly bright and colorful and it all seems very tolerable, after that first drink or two. And after the bottom of the bottle, well maybe there will be some sleep...

It might just kill me. I was going to die anyways though. I can't help myself. Cheers.

1314250464.0,jtqxj,My near death experience and detox. [WARNING: Wall of Text],texpundit,87,26,60,"Well

I grew up dirt poor on a subsistence farm in the middle of rural south Texas. Due to my grandfather and his german and scottish background, I was right there with my little glass and he'd give me just a little bit. That was my first taste of booze.

That ended as I got older and I went boozeless until I was about 16. When I was 15-16 I raced motocross. When I was 16

Fast-forward to age 23: After playing in a string of go-nowhere bands, the webmaster for the city I lived in, major online content producer for the local newspaper and creative director for an advertising firm. I'd run out of job options and was drinking pretty much every night. Also, during this time, I racked up 3 DWIs and a host of other alcohol related jail stays.

My friend up here in DC needed a roommate and help with founding a startup non-profit organization (I also had a long term freelance project I was working on, so I moved. One way plane ticket, 4 bags of laundry and a laptop. For the first year I was here, I cut back my drinking a lot.

One year after I move here, but was extremely stressful, even though I *loved* the work. Being stressed constantly, I got back to drinking every day. The minute I got off work, I'd head to happy hour and start drinking. This drinking eventually got worse and worse.

Fast forward 5 years and I basically drink myself out of the job (mid March of this year). With nothing left to do (no job, no real motivation), I proceed to start drinking all day every day. I dry myself out a few times, but relapsed rather quickly after each attempt.

About 2 months ago, you also eat lots of fat.

So, along with the alcohol that's already stored in the fat already in my body. When my body burns the fat, it releases a FLOOD of alcohol into my system along with what I'm already drinking...which, by this time, is A LOT. I was up to roughly a half handle of whiskey a day if not more.

**(BIG NOTE: I didn't realize about the whole diet making things exponentially worse until just Monday afternoon.)**

For the last 3 weeks or so

In the last 2 weeks, so about a week and a half ago, I start taking Unisom (an over the counter benzo sleep aid) just to sleep through those shakes and get more than an hour or two of sleep. I went through a 32 count bottle of 50mg Unisoms in roughly a week. I was having to take up to the maximum daily dosage (300mg or 6 pills) just to get a few extra hours sleep. I empty the bottle Tuesday of last week. It's also at this time I realize I am WAY past trying to taper so that I can detox myself again.

Note that on top of all this

Also note that about 4 years ago

Back to last Wednesday night and I'm looking at my (then) current condition and reliving what my mother and sister went through with my father's death and all the shame and guilt I was feeling for ending up just like him (I couldn't stand the guy. He was the drunk I never wanted to be but eventually turned into.) and I lost it. I had a depressive breakdown

So, I put out a desperate plea for help on the WashDC subreddit for detox information. I get a flood of info and decide to check into a place very near my apartment. I've never been to a full-blown inpatient detox, so I know jack shit about them. The one I end up checking into is a social detox, which means cold turkey and they just watch you. I didn't know this.

Friday

By the time the afternoon rolls around my blood pressure is up to 186/111. I was probably 2 hours or less away from a seizure/stroke/heart attack. In other words: **fucking dead**.

The people proceed to take me to the ER at a local hospital with a world class detox unit and drop me off. The ER gets me fixed up so that I don't die on the spot. The ER doc also decides that I need controlled

I now have a prescription for high blood pressure meds and a new lease on life. I'm sober and I feel better than I have in over a decade. I'm happy. I feel healthy. This is the best thing I think I've ever done for myself in my life.

Also, that's good. This is something I've needed to do for a long time and I'm infinitely glad I did.

I guess the reason I'm venting this is as a cautionary tale. If you're going to booze, people that love you.

Even though I didnt live there and was broke, didnt win our division by a long shot but it was great. 

We head back to the campsite with some booze and food to cook on the fire. Everything was going smoothly and the 3 camping lots adjacent to us were empty and we were drinking and being surly. All of a sudden all these super hot high school looking chicks roll up in bikinis and start camping in all 3 adjacent camping sites. The whole campsite took notice as they set their tents up and what not. There was probably 8 or so girls and 4-5 guys, but they were getting only smoke and no flames. We go over and notice their 'fire' consisted of dumping a bag of non-self starting charcoal and trying to use our lighter to get it started. We give them a news paper and two of our logs and tell them to get kindling and all that to get going.

Thirty minutes later still nothing. We decide to take our cameras out and take a picture of their epic failure and one openly declares ""Theyre taking pictures of us"" and we laugh sort of embarrassed and finally go over and basically do it for them.

The night goes on as any camping adventure would, they were all laughing. We found out they were from a French school in Chicago that brings rich kids from France to America to go through high school.

We proceed to get pretty wasted and because it was such a long day of discing and boozing we hit the bed. I recall waking up and taking a piss in the woods nearby where the campfire of French kids were all talking. They probably saw me but fuck em. I shamble back to my tent and zonk out hard.

But it wasnt my tent. It was the teachers tent and it just happened to look exactly like my tent and have the exact same layout of bedding and shit. I was awoken sometime in the middle of the night by a group of them poking me with a stick.

1333586746.0,rtuxz,How I got home from the Pittshow meetup [long],lattrommi,68,10,39,"**tl;dr FUCK GREYHOUND** and I might not be built to travel well.  

This story begins with waking up and trying to figure out how to get home. Several people had offered to buy a Greyhound ticket and one was eventually procured, I owe you, and the rest of the Pittshow a ton!  

Eventually I was dropped off at the station. Went in and the counter clerk was no where to be seen for 15 minutes give or take. All the sudden she popped up from under the counter

I tried to check my bag and she said I couldn't bring my bag on because the zipper was broken, I can't deal with this."" and gave me back my ID then walked away. I plan on filing a complaint in the near future.  

So I said fuck it and thought I should just try to hitchhike home. The problem with this is that I had no idea how

I ended up coming across a traveler by the name of Hiker who we had met earlier, looking for a good on ramp to sit at, but got drunk in the process and lost. I ended up walking train tracks for a bit and came across a busted up building covered in grafitti and decided to take a nap.  

I woke somewhat more sober and logical thinking and walked back to the greyhound station. The same counter girl was there and still being a bitch. She said I was too drunk to get on a bus. I told her that I would let the driver be the judge of that

I eventually got on to this crowded bus. During the trip I did start to withdraw

Thankfully the columbus to dayton bus was less crowded and I could lay down

Now comes the part of me getting home from greyhound. I had foolishly spent my money on beer and vodka and now had no money to catch a local bus to my apartment. I was also starting to get bad withdrawals, but that was useless, so I started walking, thinking it wasn't that far of a walk. 10 miles really isn't that hard of a walk for me, but withdrawing it was fucking awful. Every few blocks I had to stop and puke, usually in an inconspicuous place, but I do recall puking in front of a really beautiful house with a well kept yard and getting odd looks.  

At one point I got to a library and asked facebook for help, got to the center of town, randomly puking in trashcans and getting more odd looks and was called a worthless junkie by some old lady.  

Tried spanging bus fare a bit more

When I got home I went through the worst withdrawals I think I've ever had. I sat in cold water in my bathtub for a couple hours, when I was finally capable of moving again. I still feel awful, but at least I am not puking anymore, and even got some food in me.  

I still had a ton of fun at the meetup

My early days of drinking, sociable. And I was able to balance it with a relatively responsible life with ease.

The years go by, just become bored with life.  This is where the fun, sociable Stu turned into the shitfaced drunk every night Stu. I started engaging in behaviors like driving drunk at two in the morning on a Tuesday to play in an
 illegal poker game just because the thrill of maybe getting caught made me feel alive. 

I tried to stay married. Really I did. Didn't run around on her

Now we're in act 3. You know me as the single dad, to an extent. 

Sober Stu is a friendly, giving, doting father, relatively healthy kind of guy.

Drunk Stu is a self serving

So I'm back to the delicate balancing act. I can't fuck this job up

I'm pretty much on my third strike with my girlfriend. The next day I wake up and can't remember how I got home, but surely I woke her up stumbling in. She probably took my clothes off, put me to bed, and told me we're done.

All morning I was sweating and sick wondering how the night ended. Finally around noon

Monday started like any other day

Cut to bar número uno, he drinks water, I am disappointed.  A few pints later, I find myself 5 km away in another part of the city at some trendy faggy hipster bar. 

As I purchase an admittedly over-priced beer, he has to go set up a gig, I decide that I am now a very capable, experienced stage hand and I too, will do some sound engineering shit.

The gig: we enter some secluded courtyard

Suddenly, the golden glitter man is sat in a tree playing a xylophone, I am surrounded by a hundred odd people and there is a crazy naked old woman painted completely white dancing in some mud. I smoke a joint. 

The show ends, I am very stoned, it is time to leave. 

Back to the bar, vodka. The DJ asks if anyone can play drums and points to an African drum thing next to the booth. I step forward, I have become a musician. I play the drums for what seems like an eternity, I'm fairly certain I am shit. The clientele seem to like it, two drunken Russian men dance wildly around me and some girl repeatedly brings me shots of Jaegermeister. 

Not sure what happens next, he doesn't seem to be able to remember either. He looks at me wild eyed and explains in a mixture of words and guttural grunts that we are drunk, stoned and lost.

We find a shop and buy more beer

I wander the road for what seems like forever

Bright sunshine, I smoke it...I have no idea where I am. The dog looks at me, it gives me a look of a disdain, it's eyes bore into mine. This is some scooby doo shit and I am too hungover to figure out what is happening.

1364293388.0,1b18mg,Let's talk about loss. Real loss.,myminisnameistwiggy,80,24,52,"Let's talk about loss like the title says. 

This comes off rather bitchy or cunty

But you want to talk real loss? Let's talk about the type of loss that keeps you awake at night with guilt. The loss you feel when someone you love or care about beyond belief goes away or dies. The loss you feel when you look at your childhood and realize the exact moment you were no longer a child. The exact moment you were aged 100 years overnight. The moment the child and the happy kid you were went away. 

The moment you had to be in the hospital hearing that your friend that purposely overdosed is dead. The moment the one you love that had been hurting you and abusing you in countless ways hurts you in the final way where you *finally* have the courage to leave. There is a tipping point. Everyone has one. Throughout my life I thought I've had my moments that were my tipping points. Every time I had one

Endless cycles of abuse, depression, anger, self-loathing, benders because you can't meet someone's needs, unable to help someone, unable to be all you need for the one you care about, unable to feel *normal* ever, but then there's the trigger. There's always that trigger. You're reminded of the loss. 

There is pain and loss

Grief at not just one's death and the sorrow that accompanies that. But the grief and loss you feel at realizing that what you were ages ago was killed. That person is dead. The happy kid? Gone. Too much self-realization is a dangerous thing.  I avoid doing the self-introspective thing because it gets me in a dark place. 

I've lost things. I've known joy. I've known love. But I know pain, my parents never agreed with me"" or ""oh, I lost this friendship"" is bullshit. You want real loss? Look at your past. Pinpoint the moment you stopped being *you.* Pinpoint the exact moment you were no longer the normal, healthy kid you were. The moment someone hurt you in such a way that you lost everything you ever were. You stopped being you. You stopped being the happy kid that would catch caterpillars and take care of them till they bloomed into butterflies and you started picking up substances or habits and seeking out something to make the pain stop; drugs, sex, alcohol, etc. 

Then when you *think* you've gotten over the loss? It comes back. It breaks a massive piece of you away when that loss occurs

Those five stages of grief we all know too well? They're not just about losing someone you love. It's about losing what you were. 

Denial.

Anger.

Bargaining. 

Depression. 

*Acceptance.*

But how do you get to acceptance? Are we ever going to get that? Do we ever reach that sense of acceptance? Is that why we can't stop the endless cycles of self-harm, etc.? What gives us acceptance? Are we never going to be able to reach that? Can I never find some sort of resolution or answer to this? Am I stuck in the first four steps forever? 

I know what it's like, but family, friends, etc. 

Are we ever going to be able to be happy again? When the cycles are endless and you're in so much pain all the time and so angry *all the time*?  When your own friends you see after a while tell you that you look like you've aged ten years since you've seen them. When your parents tell you that you don't look the same. When your brother tells you that you haven't been the same since he can't remember. When you look at yourself and can't understand why you're not the person you were anymore?

How do we find that happiness? How do we find that *acceptance* part of grief and loss? Can we ever? Or are we fucked forever because we're stuck in this cycle of polysubstance abuse, self-harm, etc.? What breaks these cycles? What helps us get over the loss? Can we ever? 

Look either way

I'm drunk and I don't know what else to say. I've ranted enough. I'm not re-reading this and I'm just going to post it before I get too self-conscious and delete this.

Cheers.

I've been working at an office for a little over a year. I was hired in at the same time as this girl--we'll call her Cuntface. Cuntface and I became good friends (or so I thought) during the past year

Recently I began to have sexual feelings toward Cuntface (and how could I not? She has a cunt for a face)

Last week at work she wouldn't even look at me, this is awkward,"" but awkwardness I can handle. I mean, what self-respecting CA hasn't had to deal with that before. I tried texting her last weekend to say, ""Look, I get it. You're not interested. Let's not have this be awkward anymore,"" with no response. Still I thought little of it other than

Then this morning, she's trying to get me fired.

All the gory details flooded into my head: I'm 32, she's not; and my overt sexual overture is recorded on Facebook for eternity. My friends, if I would've had a fifth in front of me at that time, I would have literally chugged it in its entirety to calm the panic.

I went through most of the day in a cold sweat until finally I couldn't take it anymore. I cornered our director, though, I'm still in fucking panic mode over here.
