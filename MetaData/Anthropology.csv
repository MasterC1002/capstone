&gt; This world with all the created things in it has a certain order and solid construction. It shows nexuses between causes and things caused, in a pattern that is both remarkable and endless.

&gt; One should then take a look at the world of creation. It started out from the minerals and progressed, to plants and animals. The last stage of minerals is connected with the first stage of plants, such as herbs and seedless plants. The last stage of plants, such as palms and vines, is connected with the first stage of animals, such as snails and shellfish which have only the power of touch. The word 'connection' with regard to these created things means that the last stage of each group is fully prepared to become the first stage of the newest group.

&gt; The animal world then widens, in a gradual process of creation, it finally leads to man, who is able to think and reflect. **The higher stage of man is reached from the world of monkeys**, in which both sagacity and perception are found, but which has not reached the stage of actual reflection and thinking. At this point we come to the first stage of man. This is as far as our (physical) observation extends.",,,,

I understand that he writes ""pop science"", naturally. I think he's done wonderful things for the science world and has gotten a lot of people interested in social sciences. He's brought a lot of attention to less known fields.

Being studying Taoism, is that the part of Shamanism I've studied about stems from Nordic culture (being from Finland myself, I've been reading mostly about the local Shamanism practiced in history) where was very little contact with the outside, global world. Shamanism was practiced here in dispersed settlement areas (at the time the Northern parts were all like that, I presume), so I guess these ideas had no impact from Buddhism or Taoism or some similar religion.

So, which makes people to have feelings of ""being one with nature"" or seeing the nature and people as a whole? Nowadays many people are *really* disconnected from their surroundings, e.g. individualism is gaining ground everywhere and many people feel they're separate subjects just flowing in this objective world. This is the opposite of what these ""religions"" are saying. So, what awakens in very different parts of the world the same feeling of the universe being in balance and people being one with nature - the feeling that many people nowadays can't feel anymore? I've pondered it could be that:

-human beings in naked nature

*this is something I've sometimes felt too

-DRUGS. Not the least! Hinduism is the root of Buddhism and what I've understood, to fall into trance. Other people in Northern parts used mushrooms too, not only shamans. As we know, especially psychedelics can make people feel one with everyone and with the whole world today too. So could it be that using psychedelics could have awakened the same beliefs/philosophies in different parts of the world and formed a part of these ""religions""?

As of last May there is now strong evidence to support the theory neanderthals (and a number of other hominids) recently admixed (~30-50kya) with humans.  Most modern human populations seem to have between 3% and 6% introgressed DNA


[Genetic and Phenotypic Consequences of Introgression Between Humans and Neanderthals](http://goo.gl/mE3Ch) (Nov 2011)

&gt; *VII. Different Regions of the Neanderthal Genome are Found in Different Modern Humans*


I think that the dust has had enough time to settle, or possibly 100% Neanderthals?**   Historical attempts at linking contemporary populations to ""archaic"" lineages have been largely motivated by ethnocentrism and racism (e.g. Jews, Basques, Roma, Irish, etc.), but this was clearly not the case with the recent discovery that [Melanesians are 6% Denisovan](http://goo.gl/8wTQm) (or that [certain pygmy groups might have admixed ancestry](http://goo.gl/J2MxN)).  Individual humans [are ancestral mosaics](http://goo.gl/H6XzC); there's even evidence that stable phenotypic variation is maintained *within* populations many generations after admixture

---

##[Hyperborea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperborea)

&gt; In Greek mythology the Hyperboreans were a mythical people who lived far to the north of Thrace. The Greeks thought that Boreas, and that therefore Hyperborea was an unspecified region in the northern lands that lay beyond the north wind. Their land, called Hyperborea or Hyperboria — ""beyond the Boreas"" — was perfect, with the sun shining twenty-four hours a day, which - if true - suggests a possible location within the Arctic Circle.

**Evidence:**

[Last Neanderthals Near the Arctic Circle?](http://goo.gl/yxeG4) (May 13

&gt; Remains found near the Arctic Circle characteristic of Mousterian culture have recently been dated at over 28,000 years after Neanderthals are thought to have disappeared. This unexpected discovery by an international multi-disciplinary team, including researchers from CNRS, challenges previous theories. Could Neanderthals have lived longer than thought? Or had Homo sapiens already migrated to Europe at that stage?

---

##[Nephilim](http://goo.gl/AVbup)

&gt; The Nephilim (plural) are the offspring of the ""sons of God"" and the ""daughters of men"" in Genesis 6:4

From Genesis:

&gt; ""There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, the same [became] mighty men which [were] of old, men of renown.""

**Evidence:**

The admixture seems to have involved only male archaics (at least in surviving lineages).  This is evident from sequenced Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA (which doesn't appear in any known modern populations)

---

##[Satyr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyr)

&gt; In Greek mythology

...

&gt; Attic painted vases depict mature satyrs as being strongly built with flat noses, and full beards, with wreaths of vine or ivy circling their balding heads.

...

&gt; Satyrs acquired their goat-like aspect through later Roman conflation with Faunus

...

&gt; They roam to the music of pipes (auloi), and bagpipes, and they love to dance with the nymphs (with whom they are obsessed, and whom they often pursue), and have a special form of dance called sikinnis.

**Evidence:**

Neanderthals evolved divergent craniofacial features (including enormous brow ridges) and, sex-biased, more common among Eurasians and 100% genetic.  If someone says it's a stretch to link it to archaic admixture, they probably haven't read the most recent literature (Neanderthals carried a variant of the gene SRD5A2 which ""catalyzes the conversion of the male sex hormone testosterone into the more potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone."").

##Ancient Egypt

[Skeletal dysplasia in ancient Egypt](http://goo.gl/hI04E):

&gt; Many aspects of ancient Egyptian culture, are well known through the monuments and records that survived until modern times. ... The oldest dwarf skeleton, the Badarian skeleton (4500 BCE), possibly represents an epiphyseal disorder...The purpose of this second historical review is to add to that knowledge with an expanded contribution. The artistic documentation of people with skeletal dysplasia from ancient Egypt is plentiful including hundreds of amulets, statues, and drawing on tomb and temple walls. **Examination of artistic reliefs provides a glance of the role of people with skeletal dysplasia and the societal attitudes toward them. Both artistic evidence and moral teachings in ancient Egypt reveal wide integration of individuals with disabilities into the society.**

[Molecular mechanisms of polyploidy and hybrid vigor](http://goo.gl/XwoH1):

&gt; For the genetically viable hybrids, if the genetic difference between the species or genera does not prevent them from forming compatible hybrids. The hybrids formed between different subgenera show more heterosis than the hybrids formed between species within the same subgenera. **If the hybrids are incompatible, they are dwarf and stunted, probably because dramatic differences in growth and reproductive development inherited from the divergent parents fail to be reconciled.**

##Ancient Britain

&gt; Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument located in the English county of Wiltshire...composed of a circular setting of large standing stones set within earthworks. It is at the centre of the most dense complex of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments in England

[Mammoths used as food and building resources by Neanderthals: Zooarchaeological study applied to layer 4

&gt; The presence of series of striations and ochre on mammoth bones are associated with a technical or symbolic use. **Furthermore, connected vertebrae) and circularly arranged.** This mammoth bone structure could be described as the basement of a wooden cover or as a wind-screen. The inner presence of fifteen hearths, lithic artifacts and waste of mammal butchery and cooking is characteristic of a domestic area, which was probably the centre of a residential camp recurrently settled. **It appears that Neanderthals were the oldest known humans who used mammoth bones to build a dwelling structure.**

My thesis is that male depression as a phenomenon in 21st century American society is an inevitable outcome of contradictory narratives surrounding gender, it's a mark against your character. It's unacceptable to lose, even though the game requires there to be one loser for every winner. Somehow it's a widely held belief that everyone has the capacity to rise up past everyone else and if you fail to do so it's a mark on you. I hate to be the bearer of bad news but this a fantasy. Not everyone can better than everyone. It just butts up against the laws of reality. 

This idea of actualizing your desires in the world to make it your own taps into the male identity. A successful male is one who can make his will manifested in reality. **Choice is then this incredible metaphor for explaining literally every behavior in human society.** Men, how they dress, eat, associate, and define themselves. In the process of choosing yourself and bringing yourself into being as the object of your own creation, you fulfill this choice ritual and reaffirm that anything is possible with choice and free will. But given the ubiquity of the choice narrative and the shame of ""choosing to lose"", there's a segment of the population who start to develop problems to this whole ""choice circus""

I think it's very telling that depressed people are ashamed of being depressed, and what's worse is that they do this alone. If they don't buy into the cult of achievement, we disown them and let them hash it all out in their bedrooms and their minds. We disown them, absolutely.

The final twist comes in the rehabilitation process. The ""cure"" for depression comes down to something like ""an attitude tune up, and other ways, the patient is then led to believe that he can achieve again in some way. He can then say that those feelings of helplessness are past him and go on with his life.

And the desire to stop this trend is understandable. But our job is not to preserve culture, but a major factor is the individuals choices in what they teach their children to help them succeed in the world (this is the one I'm talking about).

In all reality in an increasingly globalized world, Sanskrit, Latin, and thousands of other languages have gone extinct, this is natural and in a way beautiful. It demonstrates the adaptability of our species. Humans around the world recognized that their languages are losing the globalization battle so they adopt another major one. 

This part is less ""scientific"" but more my opinion. If humans ever want to work closer together and put our petty differences behind us language barriers are one of the things we need to break down. If someone needs to learn 3 languages to speak to anyone on Earth more can be accomplished. I'm not saying diversity is bad

TL;DR - the death of languages is a testament to human adaptability to changing geopolitical forces. It should not be feared

We also find a trend for heterosexuals with a nonheterosexual twin to have more opposite-sex partners than do heterosexual twin pairs.

There's been some chatter about a recent listing of ""worthless"" majors: Anthropology made that list. Yesterday one form of explanation was given: [http://nyti.ms/J3AIqP](http://nyti.ms/J3AIqP). Bruni makes some good points

However, we are being trained not necessarily with practical, hand-work skills, but rather with talents that aid us in connecting with people. We are taught to understand cultural and ethical relativism, aspect functionalism, and the importance of discerning the etic and emic.

My favorite teacher in high school, once gave a spiel to our AP Human Geography class about this very topic. The class was mostly seniors, so we were all looking forward to our college transition and possible majors. Mrs. Bernard asked us which we would prefer, a CEO who has been trained solely in economics and business practices since undergrad, or a CEO who majored in anthropology for UG and then went on to study business practices.

After some discussion, or why a concept might not get through to other employees; with a background in both the social sciences and in business, this CEO will be able to take a step back, reflect on the *why,* the *who,* and the *what,* and then go forward and address the *how.*

Don't get discouraged by these articles which claim that what we're studying is for naught; we will learn - and many of us are doing this even now - how to actively address current and future issues with our education. Even at UMD we have projects and professors addressing labor (Dr. Shackel and Mike Roller), environmental (Dr. Chernela, Dr. Paolisso, and Dr. Shaffer), and our region's vibrant and vital history (Dr. Leone).

I began to question everything anthropologically. I took my questioning to my religion, and after reading what I thought were some pretty bullshit journal articles the only thing I could reconcile the academic BS with was a sense of ethnocentrism emanating from the core of anthropology, which led me to defer my study while I got my head around it. I was very passionate about anthropology and I still am, but as much as I want to, I can't work out how to move forward with it now.

[It's related to Greek, and Egyptian ancestry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton%27s_toe):

&gt; It has a long association with disputed anthropological and ethnic interpretations. Morton called it Metatarsus atavicus, particularly during the rule of the Ptolemaic dynasty when Egypt was under Greek rulership. It was an idealized form in Greek sculpture, and this persisted as an aesthetic standard through Roman and Renaissance periods and later (the Statue of Liberty has toes of this proportion). There are also associations found within Celtic groups. The French call it commonly pied grec (just as the Italians call it piede greco), but sometimes pied ancestral or **pied de Néanderthal**.

[Neanderthals had it (according to the late Stan Gooch)](http://www.scribd.com/doc/76942532/The-Way-We-Are):

&gt; All Neanderthal fossil feet and fossil footprints have the big toe shorter than the second toe. All Cro-Magnon fossil feet and fossil footprints show the big toe longer than the second toe.

This is probably because it's linked to fetal androgen exposure

[Finger Length Ratios (2D:4D) in Anthropoids Implicate Reduced Prenatal Androgens in Social Bonding](http://www.scribd.com/doc/49488854/) (2010)

&gt; Relationships between 2D:4D and sexual selection have been shown at the population-level (Manning et al., as is found in polygynous systems, could lead to selection for high PAE (Manning et al., 2004b; Manning,2008). High circulating androgens promote male competitive behavior (Klein, 2000) and mechanisms facilitating dominance and aggression may be most adaptive in populations where males experience strong competition for access to females (Grey, 2003). In addition, exposure to high prenatal androgens may also be important in supporting female social hierarchies(Ostner et al.

[Digit ratio is also linked to autism](http://goo.gl/KaM31)

&gt; I get a little preoccupied with the genetics of Asperger's; it runs down my father's side of the family like a shot (at least five generations). Lately I've noticed that many of the people around me have a Morton's toe (the second toe is longer than the big toe). This includes my best friend, and myself. This is a recessive trait that only appears in 10% of the population or less. All of the parties involved are the children of professors, four have been diagnosed w/ ADD, ADHD, or Asperger's. I know it's a small sampling, but according to Freud, it only takes two sets of interrelated variables to produce a pattern. Quick poll--how many of y'all are both sportin' a Morton's toe and neurological variances?

**Questions about you:** (feel free to be a little vague here if you want to keep from revealing too much about yourself.  I would absolutely welcome private detailed messages from any of you if you'd like to chat!)

1) What is your job and what do you do there?  What is a typical day for you?

2) What is your education history?

3) If you went to grad school


**Quick background about me**:  I'm a senior in my undergrad

I am primarily interested in osteology, evolution, sex and sexuality, forensic anthropology, and anthropogenics (yeah...having some trouble narrowing things down).  

I love primatology and archaeology

I would love to have the opportunity to travel occasionally

I will be going to grad school and hopefully starting my career in California with my primary geographic interests being the American West, I can't afford them and now I don't have time as I'm graduating next spring and taking full time classes until then to make that happen.  I will likely be doing research this fall in bioarch and/or primate osteology, depending upon who offers what first.  

**Questions to help ME**: (if you answer these I will love you forever)

2) What would you suggest to help me get to where I want to be?  Do you think a PhD is necessary for what I want to do?",,t5_2qkdk,1369794299.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropology/comments/1f8qb5/lets_talk_about_jobs/

1364009839.0,1auaux,Game Server Anthropology: Some thoughts so far over the culture and dynamics that exist in my running social experiment,spaceribs,49,6,22,"Me and my team host one of the larger apocalyptic style minecraft servers. It is an anarchy server, I'd love to talk about it from a human experience perspective.

When I set up this server

1. You cannot chat with other people normally
2. You can create radio beacons which can be locked onto by others
2. You randomly spawn within a huge map when you first get there and whenever you die, you didn't know if they were there to kill you or be friends. This also meant you wouldn't be able to just get on and group up a friend immediately, you had to go through a serious ordeal to get anywhere near someone you knew.
3. On top of the normal environment, making it extremely difficult to loot for items.

There has been heavy role-play around the ""zombie apocalypse"" experience

1. **Groups tend to have a knack for destroying themselves:** This is one of the biggest themes so far. As soon as people become associated with a ""Group"" of any sort, corrects this social habit, they become infamous and eventually loathed. There has been cases where groups appear specifically to destroy the ""Famous"" group. The longest living groups on the server have a very loose structure or instead focus on a specific useful goal. One group, (called The Cable Company) focuses on connecting vast distances together, and they have survived on the server for quite a long time because the provided a service that everyone benefitted from.
2. **The most successful players seem to be the most anti-social:** Not to say they don't have social skills, but eventually reject it and continue on.
3. **Everyone wants to fix up the ruins
They are the perfect templates to rebuild society

We're going to be starting up a new map when we're done with development. I'd love to hear your feedback from an academic perspective

Thanks for reading

&gt; Are men more interested in sex than women? Some believe that this is true

&gt; A person who has attempted to ascertain this is the Norwegian comedian and journalist Harald Eia. For more than a year since he took up this and several other sociological issues in a series of documentaries for NRK's ​​behalf. The series created a major debate about gender scientific culture.

1327763621.0,p0iq2,"""The most interesting genetic changes are surely those that change minds rather than bodies. And there are several lines of argument that suggest that the Neanderthals may have had something to contribute along those lines as well.""",Slartibartfastibast,38,1,2,"[The 10

From page 53:

&gt; The key point here is that it would take only a very limited amount of interbreeding for modern humans to have picked up almost every Neanderthal allele with any significant advantage. Limited interbreeding would mean that neutral genes in humans today would look almost entirely African—which they do—while at the same time we might carry a number of functional alleles that originated in Neanderthals. Those alleles would be ones that mattered

...

&gt; The alleles most obviously worth stealing would be those that implemented adaptations to local conditions in Europe. That might mean, resist local diseases, or adjust to big swings in the length of the day over the course of a year (in contrast to the tropics, where the length of the day does not vary much). These kinds of adaptations, along with the more sophisticated, technological solutions to cold characteristic of modern humans, such as building shelters and so on, and eventually of the Americas.

&gt; These sorts of changes were important—adaptation to local climates and pathogens was obviously necessary for humans to succeed in northern climates. But on the whole, the question of interbreeding with them would not matter so much. **The most interesting genetic changes are surely those that change minds rather than bodies. And there are several lines of argument that suggest that the Neanderthals may have had something to contribute along those lines as well.**

&gt; Changing Minds

&gt; Neanderthals had developed larger brains during their time in Europe, but **there may have been functional differences.**

[Another reason to look for tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 21](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/%28SICI%291098-2264%28199801%2921:1%3C1::AID-GCC1%3E3.0.CO;2-5/abstract) (1998) in the journal *Genes

&gt; If Sataka et al. (1997) are correct in suggesting that tumor suppressor genes of importance for the development of stomach cancer map to the long arm of chromosome 21, carcinomas of the esophagus, lung, and ovary are also rare in DS**, which would fit with the observations of loss of heterozygosity for 21q in these neoplasms.

Here are more papers that mention specific tumor suppression genes in chromosome 21:

* [Frequent allelic loss/imbalance on the long arm of chromosome 21 in oral cancer: evidence for three discrete tumor suppressor gene loci.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10523685)

* [A tumor suppressor is DSCRibed on chromosome 21](http://www.signaling-gateway.org/update/updates/200906/su-0906-1.html)

* [Role of chromosome 3p12–p21 tumour suppressor genes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma: analysis of VHL dependent and VHL independent pathways of tumorigenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1186920/)

A single chromosome duplication is essentially the largest [copy number variation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation) one can define.  Because these block-mutations just vary the copies of existing information (rather than adding new stuff) the less deleterious ones are now believed to be behind a lot of our species' phenotypic variation (in addition to SNPs).  My hypothesis is that very rare natural events that lead to cancer epidemics may strongly select for a simple mechanism that maintains

Admittedly there might be strong selection *against* such a mechanism in any small group of humans, only manifest later in life).  But because the chromosome is transported whole, there isn't any loss of genetic information.  People with down syndrome are capable of having children without the condition, meaning they carry an intact human germline that is very resistant to a specific type of mass extinction event.

Even if it initially had no adaptive benefit, to cluster in a fashion that protects certain members of the species (using them to house the local genetic diversity) in the rare case of a carcinogenic disaster.  There's even some evidence that genes allowing longer dendrite formation and more plastic neurological functions, stuff that may have only recently come under strong selective pressure in humans, might have required the relaxing of certain anti-cancer functions.",,False,,True,t3_tkyut

----

The hypothesis of the evolutionary origin of bipolar disorder (EOBD) synthesized ideas about the biological clock and seasonal shifts in mood (Rosenthal, the hypothesis is extended (EOBD-R) to suggest Neandertal as the ancestral source for bipolar vulnerability genes (susceptibility alleles). The EOBD-R hypothesis explains and integrates existing observations: bipolar disorder has the epidemiology of an adaptation; it is correlated with a cold-adapted build, and its moods vary according to light and season. Since the hypothesis was first published, data consistent with it have continued to appear.** Individuals with seasonal affective disorder, which is related to bipolar disorder, have been shown to manifest a biological signal of season change similar to that found in hibernating animals. The involvement of the circadian gene network in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder has been confirmed. Because selective pressures during the Pleistocene would have been greatest for women of reproductive age, they are expected to manifest winter depression more than males or younger females, it is not expected that individuals of African descent, the incidence of bipolar disorder among black individuals is less than among whites. A definitive test of the hypothesis is proposed: It is predicted that the bipolar and Neandertal genomes will be more similar than the modern human and Neandertal genomes

2.) This is

3.) It is innapropriate and unprofessional to teach a class of undergraduates that Eugenics was solely the purview of Nazi Party and the Imperial Japanese

4.) Eugenics, such as those of the United States, which were in place in some states well into the 1970s, with the last legal forced sterilization apparently being performed in 1981. 

This professor is continually pandering to ludicrous idiocy from the American Religious Right that Darwinism is a cult, frankly, disgusted by his conduct. To spend thirty minutes taking steps to associate the entire history of Eugenics solely with the Nazi ideology, ignoring all the many other aspects of the theory and implementation of Eugenics, does a disservice to his students. 

Tays-Sachs screening is eugenics. Downs syndrome screening is eugenics. Pre-natal sex screening is eugenics. Forced sterilization of promiscuous women is eugenics. Forced abortion of fetus with certain heritable genetic disorders is eugenics. Access to reproductive medicine is eugenics. Artificially assisted reproduction is eugenics. There are things that help people and things that harm people. Wonderful possibilities and terrible nightmares. 

I am disgusted that he takes something complex and difficult, loaded with both terrible violence and burning hope, and makes it simple, declaring it, literally, in his own words, to be ""Evil.""

This is the language of ignorance. The language of hate. The language of polemics. Taking complex issues and reducing them to simple

Ugh. This just disgusts me. By associating the idea so strongly with Naziism while speaking from a position of authority he taints the well. Rather than increasing the complexity and uncertainty of the world he cravenly surrenders to his own fear of popular criticism to make wildly inaccurate and overly simplified statements that closes the mind to rational inquiry, regardless of whether that Ideology is something as horrific as National Socialism or something as equivocal as Evolutionary Anthropology. 

I so want to stand up and walk out of this class but I need the fucking credits. This is not the only time he has behaved in this fashion. His 'Defense' of modern synthesis evolution is aimed solely at ameliorating the claims of willfully ignorant and flagrantly delusional right-wing religious ideologues.
