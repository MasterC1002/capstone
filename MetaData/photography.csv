1327491882.0,ovy78,I am a professional photographer. I'd like to share some uncomfortable truths about photography.,icanjusttypeanythi,4709,1968,954,"This is a throwaway because I really like you guys and this post might come across the wrong way to some folks who I think are awesome.

Which is all of you people.  I dig r/photography.  That's why I'm doing this here.

This is a long goddamn thing, even if it's just typing it for my own catharsis.

This mainly has to do with the *business* of photography

This is about doing it for a living.

I think some things need to be said out loud

**1. It's more about equipment than we'd like to admit.**

Years ago

Nowadays, and those who can afford fucking MAGIC.  Let's face it: the asshole kid whose dad bought him a D3 and a 400mm f/2.8 is going to have a better sports portfolio than you when you apply to our paper.  You're both talented but we're too fucking cheap to provide equipment and so was your school.  As a consequence, he got all the primary shots he needed for an assignment in the first five plays and spent the next half-hour experimenting with cool angle choices and different techniques while you were still trying to get your 60D to lock focus quickly enough.  

True, but if you're learning on the same pace as everyone else and you are trying to keep up because your equipment can't hack it, the difference will be stark, and frustrating.
  
**2. People are doing some unethical shit with RAW and nobody really understands or cares.**

Photoshopping the hell out of photos is a nono in photojournalism

When I question anybody about this they say ""oh yeah, it's not *destructive* editing, the original is still there.""

It's not okay.

But it doesn't seem like anybody cares. Some of the shit on the wire services looks exactly the same so they got jobs *somewhere*.

That dude that got canned from The Blade for photoshopping basketballs where there were none?  He's found redemption- I remember reading an article where some editor says ""oh he sends us the raw files so we know its kosher now.""

Fucking storm chasers are the worst offenders at this shit.  Guess what he does now.  

**3. Many times

We are in the age of the Facebook Wedding Album. I've shot weddings pretty much every Saturday for a decade and if there is one thing I've learned it is the bride paradox: people hate photos of themselves even if they are good

And that's totally fine.

Now that everyone has a phone with a decent camera or a little money for a DSLR with a pop-up flash, and they really don't mind.

Consequently

And nobody cares.

My buddy, weddings, school sports, etc.,.. makes something like $70k/year in Midwest money.  He's a really great photographer, but you'll never see the good stuff he shoots because it doesn't sell.  You shoot what the clients want.

More and more

And that goes for news outlets

Nobody cares about recording history.  Nobody cares about documenting the events of our time for the future.  Just send us a low resolution .jpeg still frame from a movie you shot with your phone and that'll work if we get it by deadline because all the photographers are laid off.  Nobody seems to care.

I wish I could tell you I haven't seen it happen myself.

**4. Photography is easier than we'd like to admit.**

Here's something for you: I've been doing this for a long time.  I am an excellent photographer.  Give me an assignment and tell me what you want and I assure you

You know what? You could learn everything I know in a few months.

Maybe less if you really focus on it.

That's it.

My knowledge

In college

We were not.

**5. We need to stop being goddamn snobs and accept the coming of The Golden Age**

Remember that asshole kid with the $5k Nikon D3 whose portfolio was better than yours?  Guess how much that camera is going to sell for in say.. five years.

Would you believe $300?  $500

Have you played with a D3?  That is a sweet goddamn camera.  That can do everything you need to do

Right now.

Imagine what will be $300 in ten years.

Everything is getting better.  Sony, Pentax, everything is fantastic.  All of the future's crappy old stuff will be today's awesome new stuff.  And that means more people are going to be able to afford really great cameras that can do amazing things and we are going to see some amazing photography come from surprising places.

It's going to be awesome.

It may also be the death of our profession.

Of *my* profession.

If you want to be a photographer- wonderful, do that, I can't recommend it enough.

But I do not think we will last.

If you're ok with this CC bullshit

GIMP is no alternative. I've used it for years. It sucks. It just does. It is no viable alternative for power users.

Will this move help with piracy? No! In fact it will encourage it. The demand will be high for tools that fool the CC software into thinking you're subscribed. People might subscribe initially, and once the prices goes, they will turn to piracy to continue using the tools they intuitively thought they had purchased (of course they did not purchase anything, just rented).

If anything there's hope. This will help Adobe's competition. More and more people will be google searching ""Photoshop/Premiere/etc alternatives"" in the future. And you know what

All in all

**Edit**: Let me put it this way. Adobe have recognised that their key products are *too good*. People are not upgrading as much as they should because there's not much incentive to spend money on an incremental improvement from something that's already pretty great. Their plan is to put all of their customers on an eternal upgrade plan so that this does not happen. The problem with this is that you, but they want their customers on-board.

I see it as part of my job to set the scene for you take the best shots you possibly can. I create the moments, we only have one chance to get it right. The better we can work together, the better the outcome is for everyone.

To help us work better together

* The best thing I can mention is communication. We need to have good, find me, introduce yourself and lets hash out a game plan. I always have a printed agenda of my plans to give to the photographer. 

* This is also an excellent time to give me a few business cards. Aside from creeping on your your portfolio during the reception

* Give me a list of things you need shots of and I'll make sure you're not in the bathroom before doing them. If you need a extra minute to prepare

* If it looks like my lighting rig is going to throw you off

* My schedule is largely determined by what time you're contracted until. I understand you've been shooting since before noon and want to go, sometimes things happen that are out of our control and cause events to get out of sync. Just knowing that you're willing to stay an extra 15-30 minutes if necessary is a big help.

* I'd really appreciate a 5 minute phone call or an email a week or a few days in prior to a wedding

* I love getting recommendations for things to do during a reception (fun games, it helps me keep things fresh. 

* If you hear guests complaining about the volume or song selection while you're out shooting

* I always have a small toolkit and spare batteries

* Yes

What about from your side? What can I do to make your job easier? What should I know?

All but one of the top 10 were shot with a wide-angle lens, the two follow ups were both taken at ISO 800. f/8 was the most popular aperture, and if you include f/9 then half of the top 10 were shot at f/8-9.

**First Place

&gt;As a field biologist with a passion for birds of prey, they are unusually shy for their size.  If you google the ferruginous hawk, you´ll likely find a picture of a beautifully white, large raptor.  The bird in my image however is a rare dark morph, 3 month old female.  She was abnormally large, and the reason we have her in hand is to place a VHF (very high frequency) transmitter on her in order to track her movements.  The transmitter weighs a mere 8 grams and since she weighs roughly 2000 grams, it likely didn´t bother her that much.  I wanted a picture of her that somewhat simulated her flight and while I was walking with her, and my camera in the other

(giant wall of text

----

I'm not a professional photographer (I don't accept payment for my work)

I agreed because I've never had the opportunity to take photos of other people with a full studio style light setup and knew it would be an immense challenge and incredible opportunity to gain a lot of experience in a (theoretically) very low stress / low expectations scenario. I also like helping people out and seeing them happy about seeing a good picture of themselves

Finally

I discussed this with my friend and we determined I would set up and take headshots for two hours on a first-come first-served basis. We figured 10-15 people would be interested and I thought with ten minutes per person I would be able to at least get some usable shots. I would be setup in the corner of a ballroom without natural light with a white wall which I'd decide whether or not to use on the day.

I decided to use a continuous light setup instead of strobes for the main lights to avoid any annoying problems with batteries, so I built a [checklist of gear to pack up based on that](http://whoispete.com/dof_checklist.png). 

In order to avoid those frustrating situations where you think a photo is crisp on the camera LCD but find out it's shit on the big screen, so I ended up shooting into the Canon EOS capture app for immediate review (2s vs 5s+) while Lightroom auto imported on the back end. All of this turned out to be moot though, as the sheer quantity of people and pressure of the pace meant I did 99% of the reviewing on camera.

Up at 7AM. Zipcar loaded and on the move by 8:30AM, and I decided to use the white background with a single strobe fired remotely onto it to lighten it up (Big Mistake #1: I should have used two, one from each side).

I was slated to start at 10AM

The rest is a blur. For each person, then let them do whatever look they wanted while I took a few more shots to check and tweak the lighting. Once I was all set, I typically had them start with a serious look straight on, then joked with them to get some smiles, switch them to a slightly sideways shot, and call it when I was pretty confident I had at least a few good images. 

Some people required a LOT of help (especially those with massive forced grins)

At noon, a second around 3PM (when a nice gentleman insisted I take five minutes to do so), and the third when I was tearing things down at 4PM. I only stopped at 4PM because we were literally closing down the hall - I still had people in line and was desperately rattling off last minute pictures. 

When I got home

I've spent around eight hours so far sorting and processing the images. I've finished the first forty people

Some things I learned:

1. When you're editing free photos of 80 people

2. Not having full control of your lighting conditions sucks. The main lights for the ballroom were orange/magenta halogens about 30 feet up that apparently could not be turned off. There was basically nothing I could do but shoot through it and try to drop it out as subtly as possible in post. When I started I figured it wouldn't be a big deal because I'd only have a few skin tones to fix

3. Always build in breaks to monitor your setup. I felt so pressured that I kept shooting non-stop. I didn't check how full my cards were

4. I expected to have time to review images with each person and get their feedback, but it was just a brief check before I went on to the next.

5. On the other hand

6. I did not stop to take a picture of my setup. Or the line. Or

7. Whenever people see my photos, though, I saw the thoughtful look in their eye when I explained how much better the images would be if they got a true professional, worked with them, and paid a fair rate. I hope a few more photographers in the DC area will have some business in the coming months as a result.

Bleh. Thanks for letting me vent. If you read this

*(edit to clarify: I don't take money because I'm not a pro and I want to deliver whatever I want - a pro works with you to get exactly what you want.

First, I am mostly focused on the fine art side of photography, with a sprinkle of street photography thrown in for good measure. 


I'd say, I do offer to do some things for free when it feels right - and it certainly did in this case.


The photo was taken in an indoor used goods market (fleamarket). The shop was sort of carved into a darkly lit hallway. I discovered this place about a year ago and really enjoy people watching there, after the third time talking to him, I finally worked up the nerve to ask to take his photo. There was never any question in my mind that I'd be giving him a copy - it just seemed the natural thing to do as thanks for him being such a warm and willing subject. :)

We would like to use your photo as a half page illustration for an article about your region. Of course, you will get FULL CREDIT at the bottom of the page, and we can also add a link to your website. Please contact me at....""*

Here is my experience with these requests:

**1) Photo credit is worthless.** If it attracts any attention to you as a photographer at all

Basically

**2) Don't even start discussing or explaining why you want money** for the rights to publish your photo. To any serious client

**3) 98% of the people requesting to use photos for free are not willing to pay ANY AMOUNT for your photos**


So now

*""Hello!
Thanks for your interest in my photo(s). I'll be glad to license the photo to you for publication in _______. My fee for a one-time use, so I can quote you a total price and send through a licensing agreement for your approval.""*

The price depends on who's asking. There are plenty of websites that offer advice about how much a license should be worth. Point is

Realistically

Now, I'm not trying to make a living off this, but do like the extra cash paying for some of my gear at least....

I'd like to hear what everyone elses take on these requests is.

Saying it in a blogpost is one thing

I work as a professional photographer

[If we take a loot at the new ToS for instagram which will go live January 16](http://instagram.com/about/legal/terms/updated/) we can see the following paragraph

&gt;Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. **Instead, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service**, except that you can control who can view certain of your Content and activities on the Service as described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available here: http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/.

To those of you not fluent in the language of photographic rights

There is also no part in their terms that state that this license will expire. There is this paragraph

&gt;Upon termination

But note how it says that all the licenses and rights that have been granted TO you not BY you will immediately cease. IE that non-exclusive, sub-licensable, worldwide license you gave them when you uploaded that photo? Well they still have it.


Then there's this gem:

&gt;You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties, fees

Whatever you upload

Combine this with the above paragraph and they've got the right to use your content whenever however wherever and to sell it to whoever; if Instagram gets sued for infringing on say one of Adidas trademarks that appear in one of your photos

This is quite insane.

Some argue that these terms are similar to other photography or photo social networks

Here are similar clauses from other Photo related social networks:

[**Flickr / yahoo**](http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/utos-173.html)

&gt;CONTENT SUBMITTED OR MADE AVAILABLE FOR INCLUSION ON THE YAHOO! SERVICES

Services solely for the purpose for which such Content was submitted or made available. This license exists only for as long as you elect to continue to include such Content on the Yahoo! Services and will terminate at the time you remove or Yahoo! removes such Content from the Yahoo! Services.

Note the lack of need to sub-license and transfer the license in the yahoo rights? These are by far the best I've read.

[**1x.com**

**Photographing someone or somewhere kinda boring or plain? Want to punch it up with some cool vintagey or light leak lens effects without sacrificing quality of the over all image or using photoshop? Then try this:**

* Take two plastic sandwitch bagies
* On the opposite end as the zip-lock (the closed end) rip it
* Wrap the zip-lock end around your camera lens leaving the torn end overlapping the lens a little bit. Most of us are holding the lens while we shoot so now you are holding the plastic bag on the lens with your hand. 
* Now manipulate the bag as you shoot so the center of the lens is unobstructed and have fun!

clear baggie examples:

**[pic 1](http://i.imgur.com/jwoMMtf.jpg) [pic 2](http://i.imgur.com/kpfTUAC.jpg)**

purple colored baggie examples:

Hello all!

In response to [Aeonblacks self post](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/j923z/vote_on_what_content_you_want_to_see_in/) asking you about what kind of changes you would like to implement in this subreddit we've now changed the rules.

The new rules

* Photos / blogs / your own photos are ONLY allowed if they foster discussion

* Photo critiques, /r/itookapicture/, /r/photocritique/ etc. 

* Blogspam, ITAP and karmawhoring is not allowed.

They've mainly stayed the same; we've tried really hard to keep them short and simple. The only major change is that we now DO allow photo posts within certain limitations. If you only want to show off a photo you should go to one of the appropriate photo sharing subreddits

We're also going to reshuffle the sidebar and move things to the [FAQ](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/photography)
 to keep the sidebar less cluttered and to be able to add things. This is not really done yet.

As a photographer and a data addict

If you missed the last part in the series, and we look at some patterns and trends.*)

---
**The Exposure Triangle

In this part 2 of the series

---
**Analysis of Aperture**

Other than focal length

* **[Aperture
* **[Aperture histograms, People, Animals categories](http://i.imgur.com/5NbxSJ2.png)**
* **[Aperture histograms, Sport, Macro categories](http://i.imgur.com/ZyQOJeZ.png)**

In case you haven't seen a boxplot before, and People are the category types that shoot most often wide, wide-open. This won't come as a surprise by itself, but this really quantifies the difference.

For Family shots, for which half of all shots seem to have been made between f/2.8 and f/6.2.

Sport, with the most middle-of-the-road f-stop hanging somewhere between 4.4-5.6. This number does not elevate until you get to the Travel, City and Architecture, Concert, and Landscape categories.

For Landscape

Of interest here is how many People shots are done at f/1.4-2 - wide open, who needs about f/1.8 to get to an FX f/2.8 amount of depth of field.

Also

---
**Analysis of Focal Length**

Another big factor in framing and composition

* **[Focal length
There are some extremely wide-angle wedding photos in this set. But then
* **[Focal length histograms, People, Animals categories](http://i.imgur.com/XdtT3qr.png)**
* **[Focal length histograms, Sport, Macro categories](http://i.imgur.com/1rtRcBE.png)**

City and Architecture, mostly using the 8mm-24mm range. In the meantime, Animals, with a whopping median focal length of close to 300mm, takes the cake as the type of photography with the most demand on zoom. The graph does not show it for clarity, but its top 25th percentile reaches high beyond the 1200mm level.

---
**Analysis of ISO**

Probably the least important control

* **[ISO sensitivity

It surprised me just how uniform this is, ISOs of 400-3200 compose a relative minority of all photos across all categories other than Animals and Performing Arts. For Animals/Wildlife presumably the increase is due to the necessary shutter speed, whereas for Performing Arts real low-light conditions are being encountered.

ISO speeds of 6400 and above are rarely ever used amongst Popular photos.

---
**Aperture/Shutter Speed Combinations**

What happened to shutter speed? Well

These are ""heatmaps"". From Blue -&gt; Green -&gt; Yellow -&gt; Red

So that outliers don't kick the most bulk of the data out of the frame

* **[A v. S heatmap
* **[A v. S heatmap, People, Animals categories](http://i.imgur.com/PHZNGhO.png)**
* **[A v. S heatmap, Sport, Macro categories](http://i.imgur.com/vJlgMLh.png)**
* **[A v. S heatmap, Fashion, Fine Art categories](http://i.imgur.com/rtLyDPd.png)**
* **[A v. S heatmap, Abstract, Transportation categories](http://i.imgur.com/zg3yOP7.png)**

This is a very revealing set of images. 

1. You can identify clusters of the most popular shutter/aperture combinations for each category of images. For example, f/16, and f/22, with longer exposures of 1/2s - 30s.
2. You can identify some common creative boundaries of categories of images. Know what is common, which would be slow enough for some motion blur that is sometimes seen in many Street images. On the other hand, from the heatmaps you can clearly see it is going to be very rare to see a long-exposure People photo, or a long-exposure Wildlife photo, though it can be done.
3. You can identify whether a particular category is Aperture-prioritized or Shutter-prioritized. Horizontal ""streaks"" of clusters would indicate that the shutter speed matters more than the aperture for that particular category, or that many shutter speeds work for that particular image type.

**End of Part 2**

If you see any interesting patterns in the data, if you want to see any particular data combination, have any questions, or even just to ask ""hey, what is that one Animals photo that's strangely a long exposure?"", comment as well.

I'm a photographer from Perth

Firstly I think that what's happened to this guy is completely out of hand. I don't see how the law can work like this. After reading and discussing this with many other local photographers we've realised that this is a hugely moral grey area and I would love to hear other photographers opinions on the matter at hand.

Have you been in this situation? Or know of any photographer who has? I want to gather opinions and ideas on what can be done to resolve issues like this in the future or how anyone has gone about being charged for something silly like this? 

In my opinion this could really create a huge issue for street photographers, always looking over your shoulder to see if your doing things right and that no one is offended. Seems like a very unnecessary burden. 

I honestly think the law has gone power tripping but that's just me

**ORIGINAL Story from Julian Tennant - Photography** (http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=506341452762426&amp;id=114370208626221&amp;comment_id=73731284&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=137&amp;notif_t=feed_comment_reply)
http://www.facebook.com/pages/Julian-Tennant-Photography/114370208626221

&gt;""Photographers! Possibly a very dangerous legal precedent has just been set. Read and consider the implications
&gt;
&gt;I've just left Perth Central Court after sitting through the trial of a photographer friend and colleague. He was charged with ""Disorderly behavior causing offense by taking photographs without consent"" after an individual objected to him taking photographs
&gt;
&gt;The photographs were taken on my friend's iPhone and were amongst several captured whilst out celebrating the night. They were taken in a public space and the photographer did not engage in any furtive or dodgy behavior (ie no upskirting or similar sneaky attempts to see things that shouldn't be seen). The CCTV footage tendered to the court merely showed him sitting there snapping away from time to time. 
&gt;
&gt;So, confronts Al, grabs his phone and heads off. Al follows and finds the guy handing the phone to some policemen nearby and complaining that Al is taking photographs without asking permission of the subjects in the photos. The police inspect the images and ask if they are his pix and furthermore why he has not sought permission?
&gt;
&gt;Al responds by acknowledging that he took the photographs and points out that as he was in public space he does not need to seek the subject's consent as their is no right to privacy (from photographs) under Australian law whilst in public and it was quite obvious to all that he was taking photographs
&gt;
&gt;The policeman obviously disagreed and according to the prosecution statement today
&gt;
&gt;Anyway
&gt;
&gt;So, furtive or disruptive in how he was behaving. As the magistrate pointed prior to adjourning to consider his verdict, he was of the opinion that there were many more disorderly people in the CCTV footage than Al. 
&gt;
&gt;Back in court at 2.15. The magistrate talks about the Surveillance Devices Act and how that does not apply in this instance. Also confirms that under Australian law and within the circumstances of this case
&gt;
&gt;However... and this is where it becomes scarey for us photographers. Some members of the public did object to him taking photos without permission and one photo in particular
&gt;
&gt;The magistrate said that he felt that there could be more clarification regarding photography and where the line is drawn... I got the impression that he was suggesting an appeal so that it could be further tested. But on the CHARGE presented to him
&gt;
&gt;So, the basis that people don't have an inherent right to privacy and can be photographed in a public place does not change. HOWEVER, if somebody objects to having a photograph taken and is of the belief that the act of doing so in inappropriate or illegal (regardless of whether it is or not) then the photographer may find themselves in court charged with a 'one shoe fits all' type of charge such as disorderly behavior and as happened in the case today, found guilty. 
&gt;
&gt;Think about the implications of that

**TL;DR** - Photographer takes photos on iPhone whilst out celebrating New Years. Some guy complains that his friend is in photos without permission. Said guy takes phone off photographer and takes it to Police. Photographer is arrested and later found guilty of ""Disorderly behavior causing offense by taking photographs without consent"". ALL IN A PUBLIC PLACE!

Currently it is doing an OK job but it could be so much better.

There are a lot of things missing that simply wouldn't fit in the character limit of the sidebar.

What I would like to do is remove all the content under the links ""What camera or lens for me?""

Instead I propose we move the content to the FAQ and make the headlines in question links to the relevant part of the [FAQ](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/photography). That way the answers to the questions would be much better and we could link to relevant discussions as well.

Anyone some submission karma can edit the FAQ.

I've already gone and made some changes to the [FAQ](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/photography) including listing all the known (to me) photography related subreddits in subscriber order.

I've also got another idea that might help with the amount of downvoting of ""noob"" questions; I propose that the most basic questions about cameras or lenses where the OP has done no research himself should be removed and then re-directed to the FAQ by the mod who removes the submission and asked to re-post his question after reading the FAQ.

This would a) remove a lot of annoying questions b) hopefully provide the person asking the question a much better and comprehensive answer than what the average gets now and c) in the long run get more people to read the newbie questions and give answers instead of just downvoting them.

**500 Pixel Preferences**

As a photographer and a data addict, preferences, and the general market of a slice of the photography community.

500px has done a bit of this themselves, and in 2011.

Lots change in 2 years, in 2013. What cameras are most popular today (among this particular userbase)? In what categories? What focal lengths and aperture are most popular in different photo categories?

**The Dataset**

So I scraped the 500px ""popular"", uniformized after a bunch of regex.

The result is this: **20, if present.

**What Pictures?**

* [# of Photos by Category](http://i.imgur.com/Cd5IK7F.png)

Know your target market?

At nearly 6600 (33%) photos, Animals (8%), Macro (8%), City and Architecture (5%), People (3%). These 8 categories alone cover 90% of all pictures popularized on 500px.

**What Cameras?**

* [# of Photos by Camera](http://i.imgur.com/gleho9J.png)

4055 photos of those sampled did not have tagged camera information

Of those, at 1005 photos for the 7D and 902 photos for the D7000. The first Nikon full-frame makes its appearance as the D700, at 608 shots and 3.8%.

**Does this change by the type of photo?**

* [# of Photos by Camera
* [# of Photos by Camera
* [# of Photos by Camera
* [# of Photos by Camera

As you can see, all the common wisdoms are pretty much confirmed by the other data sets.

For Animals

For Macro, 60D crop bodies clean #2-#4, while the first place is held in fact by the DSC-W50.

For People, and D700. This is followed by the D90.

**What about manufacturer market share?**

* [# of Photos by Manufacturer](http://i.imgur.com/EOWx5tI.png)

* [# of Photos by Manufacturer
* [# of Photos by Manufacturer
* [# of Photos by Manufacturer
* [# of Photos by Manufacturer

In general, at a much reduced rate of use.

*This ends part 1. If people like this one I'll do one on Apertures and Focal lengths. And of course anything else that you'd like seen done with this dataset.*

**EDIT: I have only a few minutes right now and I'll put up my data and scripts:**

* **[The dataset](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11738452/alldataclean.csv)**, Lens, Focal.Length, Shutter.Speed, Aperture, ISO.Film, Category, Taken. It's not very big and is in .csv
* My short script for **[cleaning the 500px data for the Camera categories](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11738452/clean500pxdata.R)**. It (tries to, gaps between D ####, dashes between NEX-[357], and all that. It's not perfect and definitely can be improved upon. Especially for Pentax and Olympus cleaning, and there are a lot of camera names I don't even know what to merge with. I'll probably improve upon it myself later. The language is in R, but it's in pretty standard regex so it can be adapted to sed, perl

So last night, Ontario to do some picture taking.  They have a beautiful fountain, and a statue of Queen Victoria, plus lots of neat little gardens and such. 

The area has quite the character

So I am taking pictures away.  Some of people

All of a sudden a guy is in my face asking if I took a picture of him.  I said no (not consciously anyway - he may have been in the frame)

He demanded to know who I work for (answer was no one) and what I was taking pictures of.  I said anything I found interesting (probably bad thing to say)

He said what I was doing was illegal and he was going to call the cops.  I said there is nothing illegal here and go ahead and call the cops.

I walk away and take some pictures of the fountain.  At that moment there was a really cool rainbow effect in the water.  After a minute or two the guy is in my face again (he followed me).

He demanded again to know who I was working for.  I said no one and please leave me alone.

He said he is going to call the police.  I said go ahead, and I am taking pictures on public property.

He yells out that I am a pedophile and starts going to all of the people around the fountain pointing to me saying I am a pedophile and taking pictures of all of them.

I said (believe it or not I didn't yell once) that this was a public area

He yells more.

I told him he was fucked up and to fuck off and leave me alone or I will call the police.

He just stood there staring at me.  I stared back.  An impasse

In my head I thought he was going to kill me so I was getting out of there.

I turned and left.  Kept looking over my shoulder to make sure he wasn't still following me.  He wasn't.

Hello!

I figured I'd share my grandfather's work here

http://www.zeisshistorica.org/Glatzel.html

My grandfather passed away before I became interested in photography, (which I think he was given as a gift by Yashica or Contax)  and some of the lenses he had designed. We don't have many photos of my grandfather, as they are all back in Germany at my grandmother's house. There were some really cool ones of him at meetings and what not. 

Anyways

Here's a a few quick shots I snapped.

Obviously, I just tried to white balance for it to look like it does in real life, with a slight sepia look.

It was quite a cool experience. Because of how shallow the depth of field is

The coolest part about tintype is that it's actually a negative, and all the shadows of the picture were shiny silver. I'm still wrapping my mind around how it works, so if anyone can explain in further detail, please do. 

The types of chemicals used make these tintypes are especially sensitive to blue. That's part of the reason why my eyes stand out in the picture. My shirt was blue, my facial hair appears much darker in this photo.

I'm most excited that this photograph will last for hundreds of years. I wish I could say the same about my massive collection of digital photographs.

Not bad for a kid in his first year who never took a photography or photojournalism class in his life.

It’s not easy though. It’s an tiring job. The hours are long, and both times gotten poison ivy as a result. You never know when a wreck, fire, or natural disaster will hit, so you’re on call every minute of every day. And then there are some things you see that most people don’t want to see.

It doesn’t pay much

The biggest thing I can take away from this past year is the progress I’ve made. I’ve made more progress in this year than the three years I shot in college combined.

In the end, and you never know what’s going to pop up. The job has taken me many more places than I would have originally thought, and I can’t wait to see where it takes me next.

Is this for everyone? No. But it’s exactly for me.

First thing you'll need is a sturdy tripod with a level. The closer you are to a leveled image



Let's start with what's done on camera. This method uses 2 exposures. I generally shoot at -2/+2



I'll be turning [this](http://i.imgur.com/l6XWch.jpg) in to [this](http://i.imgur.com/0axehh.jpg).



Start off by opening both files in Camera Raw. On the under exposed image

Next

Open them up in Photoshop.


In the next step



http://i.imgur.com/LTxPQ.jpg



Here's where the magic happens. (Not really) On your over exposed layer



http://i.imgur.com/4x4hNh.jpg 



The next step is some local touch ups. Select your eraser tool and drop the opacity to somewhere between 5% and 10%. Now select your under exposed layer. Now you can slowly erase any shadows that are too dark



http://i.imgur.com/9zUUSh.jpg



Now flatten the image and duplicate the new layer.



http://i.imgur.com/Y2Tyf.jpg


Now you can transform the layer and use perspective and warp to make lens corrections. When using perspective

(I've purposely stretched the walls a lot here to give an example.)


Next

Afterward, my sensor was filthy when I shot this image so you'll want to spot any of that if it's showing. Then get rid of anything weird like that wire in the left hand of the image and you're set.


http://i.imgur.com/0axehh.jpg



I have actions setup that take care of most of the work for me. Once you play around with this



This is the first tutorial I've ever written so please feel free to ask any questions if something doesn't make sense and I will answer them as soon as I can. I really hope this method helps some of you out. I use it all the time and get very good results and have extremely happy clients.

My anniversary with my SO is coming up and I wanted to get him something special that deals with photography.  It's a passion for him and even though he has a different job during the day he's recently been taking time to take a night class on photography/developing film.  I was thinking of getting a nice leather photo album for him to use as a portfolio?  Then engraving his name on the front?  I'm not sure what photographers use as a portfolio... or if this is even a good idea - I'm not sure where to look for something like that.  If any of you have any suggestions I would GREATLY appreciate it!  Thank you!

---

As the title says I photographed my sister's wedding the weekend before last.  I told her that I wasn't a wedding photographer, so I finally agreed on the condition that she understood that the photos might suck.

This is what was supposed to happen.  I and a few other people would get to the park at 12:30 to set up, the bridesmaids/groomsman photos, and then the reception stuff.  After the reception my sister and her husband and I were going to wander around downtown hanging out and taking pictures until it got dark.

Simple

What actually happened is that it rained.  I was running errands and so I didn't get to the park until a little after 2

Then we went back to the house.  And we ate cake, and had a pretty good time despite how badly things had gone.  

Oh


Now that I've been through it I see why everyone recommend second shooting some before jumping on board the wedding photography train.


But in the end they're happy with the photos and everyone had a good time.  And I guess that's all that really matters.  Speaking of the photos,False,self,t5_2qh2a,False,,,t3_1es7jb

I'd like for us to agree on a few groundrules for this thread so it doesn't just degrade into yet another flame war:

- Constructive criticism.  Provide useful feedback.  If you spot inefficiencies
- No Canon vs. Nikon discussions.  Nobody needs to rehash that one again.
- No RAW vs. JPG discussions.  See the previous point.

OK.  Hopefully this will go well.  I use Lightroom and Photoshop.

Here's my workflow:

- Shoot in raw.  Exclusively.
- Import into Lightroom.  Attach keywords during import.
- First pass through:  Any blurry, flash didn't fire, unusable get the big ""X"" (reject).
- Second pass through: Looking for shots that are just bad.  Poor composition, etc.  These get the ""X"" as well.
- Third pass through: Find groups of very similar shots.  Select them and use the ""N"" (Survey) to bring them up.  Find the worst shot and ""X"" it.  Repeat until you're down to 1 really good shot.  Hit the ""P"" (Pick).
- Repeat until you have your picks.  These should be the very best shots of the event and the only ones you'd consider showing anyone.
- Filter your view so you only see Flagged photos (your picks).
- Create a collection.  This should have a descriptive name like ""Belize 2012"" or ""Halloween 2011.""  
- Copy your picks here (LR doesn't actually COPY the files.  It's just pointers to the original RAW files which is awesome).
- I usually make one more pass through them looking for photos that just don't ""work"" for whatever reason.  Remove those from the collection.
- Add/update keywords as necessary.
- Basic edits: Crop, WB, Exposure, blah, blah, blah.
- If I need to use selections

- Once all the edits are done I again make another pass through looking for shots I just don't like.  Again

- Export as necessary.  Flickr

*you can figure out lighting to get rid of my dark-circles and crow's feet right?*

*I'm just so darn plain looking*

My short story.. I had just got my first DSLR (600D with 18-55 and 55-250) the week before and spent tons of time on the net working out how exposure worked. Took me a good couple of days just to get the basic concept of stops and their 3 controls (Aperture, Australia. When we were there I saw a lady and her kids taking a picture of a dinosaur sculpture about 500 meters away with a P&amp;S. I currently had my daddy sized lens on (55-250) and the lady said to her kids, ""he'd be able to get a better picture of it!"" To which I replied, ""Nah, this only has manual focus"". I took the picture and we both chimped it to see that the dinosaur was still ages away. I learned a week or so later that my zoom lenses could zoom and why they gave a range of focal lengths. Felt pretty embarrassed once I realised I could just have zoomed right in, the lady would have been pretty confused that I didn't know that.

Your turn!

Apparently

It was pretty neat though when people would approach me and tell me their child or spouse was coming up.  They would let me know when a big trick was coming up, and a ton about sports and event photography.

I now have two problems regarding the photos from this weekend.  First of all, I can sort out the bad pictures on a quick and dirty first pass (and I have), but now that I am down to about 3500 remaining ""decent"" pictures, how do I narrow down what I post for people to look at and potentially purchase?  Some are still not technically great photographs, but they do still show the trick really well or have a good facial expression, etc. despite technical problems.  Are those generally considered acceptable, or should I keep only the absolute best pictures and exclude a lot of the participants and some of the best tricks because the picture didn't have the technical merits it should have?  I kind of feel that I need to include as many different people as possible since I am hoping as many people as possible will purchase them.

Which brings me to my second problem.  What service should I use to host and print the pictures?  I am aware of Shutterfly and Smugmug, how much do the sites actually cost, how much of a percentage of each sale do the sites keep, and how much should I charge for pictures?

One additional question that I have; I was also asked about personal shoots.  A couple of families approached me and said they would be interested in having me come out on their boats with them for a few hours to shoot their people individually.  They had mentioned getting several of them together to spread the cost around, what kind of contract to have them sign, whether to offer pictures as part of a package or let them choose individually, whether to print these personally or just post them on a hosting site and let them order prints, etc.  I don't think it deserves near the money that a wedding or major event would, but I don't really know for sure.  I am completely new to shooting for others, and apparently stumbled into a niche that I never knew existed.  Please give me any and all advice that you can or are willing to

We mods have been talking, Teleshooter, etc).  Maxion said it would be best just to ask you guys, and of course I agree.

As I see it

### Our current flair w/ mod approval for expert/professional

Pros:

* Functional for furthering discussion and getting well-known users visible.  For example
* Impervious to trolls/offensive flairs
* Doesn't mention gear

Cons:

* Not very personal; no 'cute' tags
* Some view 'professional' tags as elitist

### Let anybody set anything photo related

Pros:

* Very personal
* We keep it photo related so hopefully it says at least *something* about you as a photographer.

Cons:

* Could *easily* dissolve into chaos
* Possibility for lots of dumb and/or offensive flairs which means added work for us mods.  If we do this

### Let people apply for any kind of flair

Pros:

* Easier to moderate and prevent chaos because your 'applications' would be in a nice little list.
* Impervious to trolls/offensive flairs
* Still retains some personality

Cons:

* People might cry censorship if we disallow something
* You won't be able to switch your flairs around frequently

This was a very popular camera at the time (it was the number one most used camera on Flickr for several years) and so a few other zoo patrons also had the same camera.

The photos have been processed, where people can buy the digital download for $2 per photo. They posted the album online with a full photo watermark. When asked about obtaining the photos from performers at the festival, they have referred them to the pay site.

I had assumed that I would be given the digital files once the album was complete. This was the first event of this scale that I have organized, they included the digital files in the price.

So I had a meeting with them today to discuss this. This came up because they were contacted by one of the performers who has a clause in their contract granting all rights to photos and videos taken of them. In our meeting today

I should have gotten something in writing beforehand, I feel that I was told it would be $1800, and it was reasonable for me to expect that it included the files because of the prior work he had done for my friend.

I am conflicted because while I feel that it is unfair for me to have to pay more for the files

They are coming up with a substantial discount for me to purchase the entire album because of the misunderstanding

Is this a normal business practice for event photographers of concerts

**UPDATE: The photographer just messaged me on facebook to offer to provide me with the entire album for $100. He will keep them for download on his site, etc. In the end, we both learned a lesson, and I look forward to continuing to work with him in the future. I will also have nothing bad to say about him as he worked with me to resolve the matter in a mutually beneficial manner.**

It's different from every other depth of field tool that I've ever seen in that it works much more fluidly and nicely and helps the user get an intuitive understanding of how depth of field works.

The iOS version has been around for almost two years (it's my most popular app) but I just now finished the Android version.

I'm going to put it up for free for a few days. You'll have to enable installing apps from an untrusted source on your device. It will run on any Android device (phones

Here's the direct link to the .apk:

https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3903183/LensLab1.0.1.apk

Here's the link to the Google Play in case you can't or don't want to side load or if you think it's cool enough to spend $1.99:

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jeffmenter.lenslab

Also

https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lens-lab/id431559363?mt=8

The idea for this app was hatched when I was trying to explain how depth of field works to a friend of mine who was just getting into photography. I thought that if there was a way to show depth of field information visually and dynamically (rather than as a bunch of numbers) then it would be much easier to learn. I think that is the case.

So

I think it's a neat tool and I hope it helps both beginners and seasoned professionals.

EDIT: Fixed it so it should work much better with smaller screen sizes (like 320x240) and should also work better with lower density tablets. Dropbox link to APK has been updated. 1.0.1 is the new version.

Okay, and sent me a word doc with a [consent form](http://i.imgur.com/onCIS.jpg) to sign, scan, and send back.  I did so, and got the money the next morning.  Yay.

The terms of the agreement are actually a lot better than I was expecting, since technically the form is just a model release.  (Hopefully they don't mind that I filled in my own information, rather than the moth's.  :)

For a long time we've been struggling to figure out a way to deal with two large ""problems"" this sub has: people asking basic questions and the photo only rule. This is how we are going to address both of them.

Every week one of the moderators will make two new threads and distinguish them. I encourage you all to upvote them as well as to post to them. 

* One of the threads will be a place for people to ask their simple/basic/stupid/silly/dumb/whatever questions. This is not going to be a place where people get flamed, techniques, etc, it will all be welcome in the question thread. Will all the noobs post there? Probably not, but if this thread exists, we can delete the simple question posts and direct the posters to this single thread. This will sort of consolidate one problem and make it much easier for those of you who hate those posts to avoid, and those of you who like to help to, help.

* The other thread will be a place for all of you to post your own pictures, but those are specifics that we will let you all decide on. I don't want anyone to feel like ""oh, if I post to that thread I'm just going to get my shit criticized until I don't want to shoot anymore"", I am fully encouraging amateurs, pros, casuals, enthusiasts and everyone in between to post here. Will people criticize you? Probably, don't let that stop you from posting! We are all here because we love photography!


So, Friday. We would let the first one run from friday (mar. 2) until the following saturday (mar. 10). After that, we will most likely keep it a sunday-saturday thing. Every week we will make a new set of threads stating the date that thread is running/active. 

Here is where we want your help. What would you like the titles of the threads to be? Do you want them to stay the same or change every week? A couple examples I came up with are ""Shameless Self Promotion: Feb. 26-Mar. 04"" and ""Simple Questions

Any further ideas for the threads? Any issues you have with them? Comments? Suggestions? Question marks?

DSLRs from Canon got one very big advantage - register distance -- you can mount almost everything on them. Actually

I hope this will catch on and we can create really great list of manual lenses.

**Please add in comments everything I missed

NOTE: This is not a list of all lenses ever

If there's demand we can expand it for mirrorless system which have even shorter RD and can get more lenses

Technical info:  

You can get adapters with focus confirmation

Using these lenses on APSC without focusing screen and/or LiveWiev will be almost impossible even with focus confirmation. It's much easier on FF although if you are 5D user be careful for your mirror! Some lenses are not compatible. I wonder how it will look on 6D.  

When you buy an adapter

Usually these lenses are really good for video work because of very long and smooth focus rings. 

**M42 (Pentax Screwmount): 45.46mm**

I explore a lot of abandoned, have been in quite a few mines and tunnels, mainly in France and Belgium.  These are pitch black, extremely dusty, and great for playing with lights.

I've tried everything from strobe with bounce flash or diffuser, candles, and carbide lamps (the latter two give a really warm, yellow light, and carbide lamps last forever, which is why so many cavers and tunnel types here like them - even though they take a while to prepare).

I've gotten best results with layers in photoshop, so I'm limited to shorter exposures.  Most of my nicer results come with around 10 pics.

The gel flashes (&lt; $10 for a set from Strobist on ebay) are fun, iso 160, no IS (big heavy tripod) and a radio remote (simple Accessory Power, about $30 on Amazon, can't recommend it enough - oh right, no gear talk.)

The dust in these places is a problem, black electrical tape is a lifesaver, put it over your viewfinder to avoid light leak.

Composition - meh.  I'm terrible at it although I get lucky occasionally.  When you're in complete darkness, and generally in an ""OMG OMG OMG"" mood because of where you've ended up, aesthetics take second place :D

1339214425.0,usptx,"Pfft, I know what Fstops are.  But, the hell are Tstops?  Answers inside.",Scythels,262,66

However, the more actual elements of glass there are in a lens, the higher its max T-stop number is. That is not so easy to determine though, because elements are compounds of different glass types, and not every company uses the same compounds (eg: Canon's telephoto L lenses are usually white because fluorine glass - the primary type used in those lenses - suffers from thermal expansion at lower temperatures than whatever nikon/sigma/tamron use. I am not sure what the other makers use, but I know canon's white monsters use fluorine glass.)

Generally

The difference is in lenses with massive numbers of elements. Take, because the light transmission of those elements is lower than, say, a zeiss 14mm T1.6 with 15 elements, the T-stop is not actually 1.2. The 1.2's are extreme examples because their apertures are so massive, but a 85 f1.2L scores only T1.4 at its max aperture. Which is only a .33 EV loss in light; not a huge deal, but something to think about. Most lenses probably lose less than 1/8th of a stop (eg: an f2.8 would likely score T2.9 or T3).

F-stops are not perfect

But who cares? In one word; cinematographers. When they're shooting a film with a half dozen primes they want their exposures to match exactly with no variance, this lens gets exactly T2.8 at F2.7"" and set the click in the ring to F2.7 and label it T2.8. Because of this calibration, T2.8 is identical across all lenses, whereas F2.8 is not.

Oh, free of distortion, and freeish of CA.

What I like about it is the composition. The location of the objects in the frame like the number on the bottom right, etc.  I feel this is the most balanced street shot I've ever taken.  I also like that you don't see the top or bottom of the car.

I can't help but feel that this sentiment is somewhat counter-productive (for some photographers). Always carrying your camera around seems to me that it would encourage thoughtless photography, well-composed photographs (especially in this day and age where the cost of film isn't an issue). 

When I go out shooting

Obviously, you might have better luck ""hunting"" with your camera (I wouldn't be surprised if the ""always carry a camera"" advice had some link to the resurgence in, oftentimes fairly mediocre, street photography that is popular now), but it troubles me that this advice is being given to *everyone*, it seems to me that it, in some ways

&gt; This is Austrian athlete Mich Kemeter, 300m off the deck, without a rope or any protection device. From the first time I met and shot with Mich, a few years ago in Yosemite, he has performed impressive feats in climbing and highlining with and without ropes. On this particular trip to Verdon, he climbed, roped, BASE jumped several times and walked several new highlines

&gt; I shot this while hanging from a 25m highline. I used a Nikon D4 and a Nikkor 16-35 f/4 VR at 16mm

&gt; I shot this at about 6am at Kirby Cove in the Marin Headlands. Walking down a dirt trail in the pitch black isn't my favorite thing to do, sharpness, NR, and the adjustment brush), but I also used Nik's LR plug-in to bring out the shadows and a bit more color. I also snagged this shot when it was still a bit darker: http://flickr.com/photos/tsipes/8512073038/. Glad you all have liked the photo, win or lose, it's always good to know that a few people have appreciated it!

&gt; I shot this photo in early April of this year while coming back to my home in Juneau from a visit to Skagway, you will usually have some good lighting during part of your ride.  Just past Haines, you sail past the Davidson Glacier, and on this occasion, the lighting made me stop the conversation I was having mid sentence and start shooting. In post, I boosted saturation, did some work with levels and curves

&gt; This photograph was taken during Thunder Over Louisville, hoping to get something interesting from one or the other. This shot was taken handheld during the finale of the fireworks. There was so much smoke that the explosions made sky look like it was full of galaxies, and luckily I was able to capture that on camera.

&gt; This was taken just after the England v Brazil game in February. I had the shot on my mind for some time since I passed the spot every day when commuting to university. It actually took me a while to shoot because I kept missing the games (Big thanks here to my flatmate who reminded me). This was initally going to be just a quick timelapse but I figured it might be more striking as a photo. Also

&gt; Heather Dufty on her splitboard, we noticed there had been a fairly large avalanche on an extremely popular traverse on the ridge next to us.  We decided we would head in that direction to see if we could offer any help, but by the time we got there everything had been taken care of.  There had been a few people caught in the avalanche, one of them buried for up to four minutes and had been dug out just in the nick of time.

&gt; I took this shot on Christmas Eve, and sometimes you can see almost nothing of the monkeys. There is also a continuous jostle between other tourists. What makes this shot interesting is the human-like expression as if the juvenile macaque was enjoying slipping into a warmth bath, but in fact, it was in the middle of eating seeds thrown in by staff.

**First Place**

http://i.minus.com/iblPbNHQTlDnc.jpg

&gt;I've had it that day. Bad day at work, grabbed my camera that I luckily took with me (best tip ever: just take the cam with you all the time, especially when you are into street photography) and started shooting. My dark blue jacket was snow white after 30 minutes out there. People thought I was crazy for just standing there in the snow storm. Turns out I am. Crazy about photography.

Just learnt a very expensive lesson and thought I would share in the hope that one of you beautiful people will avoid such a costly mistake. 

Being a wedding photog I tend to push my flash hard and as such I was going through batteries and quite a rate. Looking around it turned out it was *much* cheaper to buy Duracells in bulk off eBay rather than in a shop (50p a unit rather than £1.50 a unit) so I purchased about a 100 batteries. 

Big mistake. 

Within a few days the batteries leaked and have ruined my speedlight. Just got  the repair quote back from Nikon and it is, despite perfect packaging and looking legit the batteries were fakes. 

Moral of the story is avoid bulk batteries

Tl:DR - Fake Duracells leaked in my flash and ruined it

Back up your stuff

I'm not a professional photographer. So I guess I'm thankful that I'm only losing photos and not clients on top of money or whatever compensation that I'd have to provide for them. 

My drive was partitioned so that I had about 300GB on my C drive and my D drive was all neat (with school stuff too). On the D drive there were some 200GB in photos and another 300GB or so of video work that I've done... that's photos with my girlfriend, etc. Photos that I want to recover but am really, really considering if I can afford the data recovery (they're more expensive than I thought) as an undergrad. 

What's pissing me off the most I guess is that there were some 5000 photos of a timelapse project that I was working on. Ka-put! I thought I had backed this up to my external HDD but apparently not. 

Some of these photos are up on Facebook but more's on my hard drive than not online. 

So folks, I'm stumped now. I know people are going to say, ""Oh why didn't you do this earlier, blah blah"" but I spent most of my $$$s on the laptop and camera gear. 

Cheers and hope this doesn't happen to you. 

PS: Anyone know of any cheap data recovery centres located in Korea?

There are several things you can and should do to get the most out of the images from your P&amp;S. If you use it correctly people won't know with what camera the shot was taken. [Here's an image](http://polarlightssvalbard.com/Svalbard_small.jpg)

Now; the first thing you'll need to learn are the general limitations of P&amp;S cameras. Here's a list.

* Low dynamic range (Range of tones of gray that the camera can see; or what the brightest and darkest thing in an image can be where you still see detail)

* Slow autofocus

* Often poor manual controls

* Large depth of field

* Doesn't capture raw images

* Poor high ISO performance (noise in images taken in low light)

The big issues are the low dynamic range and the large depth of field. These two are the biggest issues which make images taken from a P&amp;S look ""amateur"" compared to images taken with a DSLR.

**How do I work around these problems?**

First we'll tackle the low dynamic range. This issue produces two symptoms in images. The first one is that you often get your foreground underexposed and sky overexposed which makes the photo look unpleasent.  [Here's an example](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/77620/example2.jpg). This is an image taken outside during a cloudy day. As you can see the ground and people are a bit dark and the sky is nearly totally white. Not really a pretty photo. What caused this to happen?

This image was taken quite up north in Svalbard during the summer when the sun is always up high. But in a normal part of the world this would equate to taking a photo at around noon. This is when the sun is at it's brightest which means the clouds are at their brightest. The second thing that creates this scene with a lot of dynamic range (difference between light and dark) is the fact that the photographer is shooting towards where the sun would be. This is the brightest part of an already bright sky. And since the ground is mostly dark rocks which reflect little light you have a scene with more dynamic range than what a P&amp;S can show you. How do you work around this? Simple, the unedited image is also better than the other one, simply for shooting in a different direction. Here the reason the ground is so dark is because the camera exposed the scene with 18% grey in mind, but that's for another lesson. The second problem of lack of dynamic range in P&amp;S cameras is that the blown out area is oftentimes VERY unappealing. Instead of just loosing information to light you get weird colorshifts at the border of the overexposed area. [Here's one showing a cyan shift](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/77620/example5.jpg). This is almost impossible to fix. Avoid it.
[Here's a shot almost against the sun that DOES work

Onwards.

The problem with slow autofocus is easy. Don't shoot moving things

Onwards.

Often poor manual controls. This is also quite an easy problem. Either shoot in auto mode or if your camera has it use aperture priority. You only need to adjust the exposure compensation anyway. Most P&amp;S cameras aren't designed with manual use in mind and therefore are very difficult and time consuming to use if you use them in manual mode. Most however work quite well in aperture priority mode since the exposure compensation feature is often just a button press away.

Onwards. Large depth of field.
One thing with cameras with large sensors (DSLRs et. al.) is that the area that is sharp is quite thin and the area which is blurry is quite large. This is an effect of a large sensor and a large aperture. You can only recreate this using post processing. Simply avoid taking photos where you would like this effect. This means when you're taking portraits you'll have to think A LOT more about your backgrounds because you can't hide them in the blur of a large aperture. You're backgrounds will show in all their ugliness. Try to find pretty backgrounds.

Onwards. Doesn't capture raw images. This is a bit of biggie too

Onwards. Poor high ISO performance. Just don't shoot when it's dark. Or if you have to do it like this. Before going out and shooting test your camera at home. Set the ISO from 100 all the way to the maximum your camera has. Choose highest one that you find still acceptable as the highest you'll ever use. Now when you're at your friends party put your camera to this ISO

And now download photoshop (the trial version) and search youtube for photoshop curves tutorials and photoshop layer mask tutorials. Boom

I've read a bunch of blogs and books by self-proclaimed street photographers

1. People use the term to be a jackass and invade others' personal space. That ""uncomfortable"" feeling that all the workshops are trying to get you to overcome? I think maybe you should listen to that. Maybe this is a symptom of me not living in NYC or Paris or London. 
2. Abusive use of black+white. In cooking,"" but most chefs will consider that cheating of sorts. B+W seems a bit like cheating in the same way. Family Guy riffed on this, but it seems like the formula is ""Oh, this photo is boring. Let's make it black and white and pump the contrast!"" Along those lines...
3. Abusive post-processing. I generally hate HDR, then it's a crutch, then it's horrible. 
3. It's a wrapper term to excuse some really terrible photographs. Badly composed scenes, angled horizons... but call it ""street"" and suddenly people seem to love this stuff? 
4. Finally, at all. I generally try to take pictures where I might want the end result hung up in my house, and there are practically zero street photographs where that's true. 

Now

1. The focus on the photographer and their bond with the equipment. One camera
2. Focus on taking photos everywhere, than using it all the time. 
3. Focusing more on the artistic aspects of photography. Some people can take better photos

**Pairings have started going out today (Jan. 12) and I hope to get as many sent out as I can. This is turning out to be much more time intensive than I originally thought but I think most people are getting great matches. Bear with me and I'll update when all matches have been sent out.**
