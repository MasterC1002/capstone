1345110431.0,ybabv,A week ago I knew nothing about SEO... here’s what I’ve learned.,s13_eisbaer,122,16,48,"About twelve years ago I built a few websites; mostly for myself, Ask Jeeves


Recently I was given the opportunity to start in the role of SEO Assistant at [VroomVroomVroom](http://www.vroomvroomvroom.com.au). It’s been a long time since I was au fait with the world of website development and search engines


I thought I knew the basics of SEO. I was wrong. The landscape of search has changed so much in the last ten or so years. Even my Luddite mother knows that Google has a tight grip on the search market these days, and the search engines focus on the end-user, not on the webmaster. This was a whole new world for me to discover, and here’s what I found:

* SEO is hugely important to the success of a website. The top three results on the search engine results page (SERP) attract [nearly 60% of the clicks](http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2049695/Top-Google-Result-Gets-36.4-of-Clicks-Study). If you can manage to get your website to rank in the top results for your desired keywords

* Keyword research is vitally important to the success of SEO. It should be the first step in any SEO plan

* Search indexing and ranking is a lot smarter than it used to be. Search engines like Google display sites they believe are authoritative and relevant

* Instead of using the old &lt;META&gt; keywords tags in the code of websites, and these crawlers can even tell the difference between content that is relevant and has been written by a human, and a page simply stuffed full of keywords to try and rank higher in search results. They also pay attention to the layout of the page, and will rank keywords depending on where they appear on the page. Certain things like number of links can also affect results.

* Whilst the technical side of SEO is very important (after all, content is king when it comes to search engine rankings. Search engines these days are geared towards the end user and what they want, rather than just organising websites by keywords.

* Content needs to be well written and contain keywords and phrases that users will search for. However, content should be useful and relevant, and something that keeps users coming back. Regular updates are important for SEO as well. Search algorithms like “FreshRank” test to see how recent/up-to-date the contents of the page are, and will rank more recently updated pages higher (depending on the topic). Blog posts are a good way to keep content updated on a regular basis.

* In addition to content (which provides the keywords for search), the more weight their links will hold (e.g. if your website is linked to by Wikipedia or the New York Times, those links will increase your PageRank a lot more than a link from someone’s personal blog). Building links is an important part of SEO, however building the wrong links can be detrimental to your website’s ranking. If the links coming to or from your website are low-ranking or untrustworthy sites (e.g. known for spam) then your ranking on the SERP will decrease.


So really at the end of the day, but it will keep the users coming back! Search engines are getting a lot smarter, and with machine learning they’re becoming more “human-like” in their assessment of websites. Page layout should also be built with the customer in mind, not aimed specifically at trying to rank higher in search engines. Panda and Penguin could spell the beginning of the end in terms of black-hat SEO techniques, which can only be a good thing for both the customer and the legitimate business website.


**tl;dr** What I’ve learned about SEO in the last week could really be boiled down into two important points:

1. **Build your website with the customer in mind**; and
2. **SEO is a constantly changing field.** If you’re out of the loop

Since I began producing content specifically for Pinterest in the last month, when, and how to submit to Pinterest I quickly began to take over the “popular” section of Pinterest and grow her site to over 100,000 visitors within the first month.
So what did I learn from these first 100

**Lesson 1: Be Pretty:**

If you’re planning to submit a traditional infographic to Pinterest with the hopes of it going big (assuming it’s not about Ryan Gosling) then the graphic will probably need a redesign. I have found that with Pinterest, and yellows) have far more success than those that keep their neutral layout. Why is this? Once your infographic hits the “new” page in any specific category there is only a small 10 minute window for the content to be repinned or liked. If you’re a new user with a small follower base this method is your only chance at going viral. If it doesn’t happen, you will have to wait another hour to try the submission again (see my blog for the Pinterest algorithm update). Since Pinterest is a visual pinboard, it will be in your best interest to redesign the infographic to be as color coordinated and appealing from far away as possible. I have also found that including actual pictures as opposed to graphics works significantly better on the boards.

**Lesson 2: Size Matters:**

When submitting any graphic to Pinterest, it doesn’t belong. Why is this so important? Because the REPIN and LIKE buttons are at the TOP of the submission. If a user has to scroll a mile just to see the entire image then it’s very unlikely they will scroll back up to press the buttons that really matter. But not to worry, it is still possible to go viral on Pinterest with that monster of a graphic. To combat the “size” problem, create a simple, square image in photoshop outlining the graphics title. Make it simple, pretty, and to the point. If you’ve been on Pinterest for any time at all

**Lesson 3: Perfect Timing:**

When it comes to other social networks the timing of submission is somewhat arbitrary. However, this happens. With the exception of Fridays, when the spike tends to hit at 4PM.
What does this mean? First of all, however, in that lately Pinterest’s servers have been having trouble keeping up with the large influx in traffic during these times. If Pinterest seems to be loading slowly or is going in or out, it’s best to just hold off on the submission for another time.

**Lesson 4: Honesty Goes a Long Ways**

I would be a liar if I said I didn’t have more than one Pinterest account. As a matter of fact, I just cruise the popular section handing out free advice and honest opinions. By doing this on the popular boards, with a novel name (I used a picture of Ryan Gosling just for the heck of it) I was able to establish over 100 followers within a week. Just like on every other social network I can confirm that novelty accounts do work on Pinterest.

**Lesson 5: Be a Creative Friend**

Every morning when I wake up, and a Ryan Gosling “Hey Girl” for good measures. However, every once and a while I will see an infographic of viral that made it through the pits to “Popular” page glory. If I see anything on the popular page that I think I would ever possibly make in the future, I make a note of it in my notebook and go about my business. The point is: I would never want to burden the Pinterest community with something that’s been done before. Much like the other social networks, the users of Pinterest recognize copies or reposted material. While you may have some immediate success in the short run, a well thought-out and creative post will bring in 100x the traffic than cheating your way. This also means, however

**Lesson 6: Don't Suffocate**

This lesson is where probably 90% of the new businesses I see trying to make an impact on Pinterest fail. If you have a business account on Pinterest and someone has chosen to follow your pins, insights, or something funny that relates to the industry and account itself. Whole Foodsnever pins any sort of products to their boards, and for good reason. They have chosen to remain true to their core values and only pin about:
Caring about the community and the environment Promoting healthy eating and education to our stakeholders Selling the highest quality organic and natural foods available Creating ongoing win-win partnerships with our suppliers By using this approach they have gained over 15,,False,,t5_2qhbx,True,,True

SEO companies are full of “experts” who have no grounding in traditional marketing techniques – for example, most of them have never even heard about them.

For those of you who don’t know, and to whom.

We all know that to get a site ranked, monotonous, soul destroying process if you follow conventional wisdom, which goes something like this: write great content and magical internet fairies will link to your site.

What a load of bollocks.

People who bend the rules might buy links or use software to spam

What you need to do is get your link on high profile

PR agencies who have adapted to online publications are rejoicing

If you want to have a go at doing this yourself, news outlets and blogs in your niche and find their editorial calendars.

Remember: your links should generate targeted traffic. If they’re not doing that, adding forum signatures or any other of the low level link building techniques, you're doomed to failure.

Instead of spending 20 hours a week doing that, spend days researching your target journalist and you will get a result which will blow your and your clients socks off.

One link can result in hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of visitors and the snowball effect will be the social media world sharing the article, this will also boost your ranks.

Hello everyone! 

I hope y'all are having a wonderful Tuesday. 

As the community grows larger and larger

Another factor that comes into play with our community is our knowledge of backlinks. We love getting new backlinks. Because of this, because of how many people are submitting their own blogs/sites. If you submit your own site, there is more of a chance that it will get filtered. 

We don't mind if you submit your own site, I am all for it. 

**There are rules to submitting your own site.**

*If you are submitting your own site, put it on your own site, and then submit it. This is just rude, and it isn't tolerated here at [r/SEO](http://reddit.com/r/SEO).

*You must be contributing something to the community. This subreddit was originally intended for SEO enthusiasts. The idea being that everyone had a good general concept of SEO already. This subreddit is for things that you have found out or tested or news on SEO. There needs to be a contribution, and I will shake my fist at your username. Don't make me shake my fist! 

If you are looking for a beginners guide

Generally all self.posts will be approved, **USE THE URL**. There is no need to use anchor text. We know what you're doing. 

The last thing

Happy SEOing!

I have just created my first website, I know) and I am trying to make a start on SEO. I'm aware that SEO is a long and complicated process which is always a work in progress, my problem is in knowing where to effectively spend my time.


Thus far my time spent on SEO has been spent:


**On site:**
Added relevant title and description tags to all pages. I had difficulty not just copying the titles and description content from the bigger sites since they clearly know what they are doing.

Added prev and next tags to paginated content. I have a large amount of paginated content (for example all quotes with the word ""love"" in (http://www.quotegoat.com/keyword/love). I have read that it is worthwhile adding prev and next tags to all the pages within these page series however this has caused google to show random pages within the series and not the first page as expected.

Created site maps for the site. The site maps came in at about 500

User-agent: Twitterbot
Disallow:

As far as I’m aware shouldn’t be blocking anything at all. I have also submitted the exact same sitemaps to Bing

Added open graph and other meta tags to single quote pages. To try and boost my social media presence (see below) I added a bunch of meta tags to single quotes pages. They work well on Facebook and I am still waiting for Twitter to get back to me about my cards application (I've been waiting a month and not even an email saying they have received my application.)


**Creating a social media presence:**
Twitter account (@QuoteGoats) - 1000 followers
Facebook page - 10 followers
Pintrest - 10 followers
Tumblr

Whilst I have had moderate success on Twitter


**Creating unique content:**
Browsing twitter has made me aware that creating content

I then went about creating a Valentine's Day picture quote gallery (http://www.quotegoat.com/valentines-day) which faired slightly better. I only got it up a couple of days before V-day which was still too late in my opinion but it proved fairly popular. I posted some of the images I created to other sites such as reddit (/r/QuotesPorn)

I think that the content I am creating is good and I will definitely continue down with this avenue (especially picture quotes)


**Paid advertisement:**
Having grown frustrated with gaining little to no views for the site via unpaid methods, most people who have come to the site through this means have spent a good amount of time on the site and are interacting with it like I hoped. Whilst encouraging, it is also frustrating in that I do not want to be paying for this traffic, yet the only way I can get it organically is through SEO which I am having very little success with.


**Link Building**
I am aware that link building should be high on my list of priorities however I am completely clueless as to how to go about doing this. I have read that you should do a search for keywords you wish to rank highly for

As far as I can tell, page 5 onwards on Google for the keyword ""quotes"" is almost entirely their own pages. As would be expected the majority of the quotes on my site are also on these other sites, how do you think this is viewed by Google? If it is deemed as duplicated content, most quote sites would fall foul of this as they all seem to have exactly the same quotes.

I am aware that this is getting to be more of an essay than a question so I shall conclude. The more time I spend doing SEO the more disillusioned I get that what I am doing is futile. What steps should I be taking to start effectively boosting my way up the search ladder? If you have read this far I am incredibly grateful

All of that being said

**Pricing**

Know how to price your business. Don't charge $15 an hour because that's what you want to make at a full-time job. Don't charge $35 an hour because it undercuts what other ""agencies"" charge and you think you can peel away clients. **SEO is a valuable service** and should be treated as such. You wouldn't go to a doctor who said he could do a liver transplant for $99.95, or other specialists time, and in some cases even more so.

So, or do your own tile, hang your own door, or anything like that? On cable shows they make it seem like it's a 15 minute - 1 hour job, then you try it yourself and you have a fucked up kitchen floor with a door that won't close right and a ceiling fan that isn't balanced.

Why? Because you aren't a professional builder

I will gladly pay a carpenter $1 for the parts and $99 for the know-how to get it done right

On a recent project for a friend I charged $1, but I would never tell them that. They got indexed, ranked, and made a huge amount of on-page fixes for a measly $1,000, and they loved it.

That's concept one - good SEO is worth a lot of money

Concept two is this: how to price when you do need an hourly rate? If you're looking to sell your services or your employees services, profit margin, benefits, taxes, etc. An agency follows this approach this way:

* Take yearly salary: $50
* Multiply by 1.3 (30%): $65, time off, sick days, etc. You can also go slimmer here and do 1.2 (20%).
* Divide by 2,080 being the number of hours in a year that you pay for.
* Multiple by **at least** 2: $62.50

You may look at that and think you're making a shit-ton of money, for 2,080 hours of actual work. There's time spent estimating, getting new clients, accounting, writing e-mails, and the list goes on. You can expect an employee making $31.25 per hour, to make you about a 10% profit margin

**Coding**

If you don't know how to code a basic web-page, yet when I go over their code it's absolute garbage. You should be able to speak intelligently on code, and I'm not talking about just H1 tags and title tags, I'm talking stuff like:

* URL structures
* How web services work
* How to create an internal linking structure for a site with 100k+ pages
* How a sitemap works for both normal pages and video
* How to approach CSS so that content is higher up in the code

**Playing the game**

I grew up online, natural search, or what the Intertubes are. This means you need to be able to show **value** to your services.

What's the best way? With their wallet. Get information on what a customer/lead/sale is worth to them

I'll add more to this later

I asked him all of this and he basically said hes focusing on link building and submitting our site to different places.  Thats fine I guess.

* **Spam comments** - CLEARLYREBEL and myself are both very active moderators. We haven't had spam last more than a few hours on average. Comment and story spam is usually picked out by the filter. I would say about 90% of the time.

## About this RFC:

Got a little bored doing guest posts and outreach so I created a 4 panel style rage comic about design and pointed the image credit to my affiliate money site

The good: 
- Shit ton of likes, 60 in the first day. Then a trickle, until an ""influential"" design guy with a big following reblogged it, resulting in ~500 reblogs.
- Even on the more esoteric templates where it was reblogged
- As the image and links propagate
- Literally took 5 minutes to put together in paint.net

The bad:
- For ~500 reblogs GA tracked only 100 referral clicks, or just a bunch of fat finger mobile clicks. Nothing tracked to any revenue, nor did I expect it to.
- The vast majority of these tumble blogs are indexed but carry no influence
- It's my understanding the value of Tumblr links has been minimized greatly with recent algo updates.

The CEO of our company has returned from his xmas holiday full of ""fresh ideas"" and one of these ideas is that we produce a monthly analytics report for him regarding our B2B site.

The site isn't transactional and through some fluke receives a good amount of traffic despite following no seo best practices.

It basically said that Google [hires a certain number of quality raters who look at websites and determine whether they are high or low quality

While I can see how that is useful to weed out junk I also think that it indirectly can censor a lot of important views. I think that ultimately means that Google gives lower rankings to people who want to blog anonymously and that can include people who have a good reason to blog anonymously.

Somebody who wants to talk about sexuality or a person who is gay and doesn't want others to know are not going to want to blog under their real name. Actually somebody who wants to sound off on political issues that their employer happens to disagree with shouldn't have to avoid blogging anonymous just so that they can get a higher ranking in Google.

I wonder if Google has algorithms that can determine if a person is using a real identity by using other webpages that can verify their identity? So even if a person uses a fake name they might still get dinged by Google.

Anyways I can't find that page? Can somebody point me to a page that says that?

Is this something that would be useful to the community? Can you see yourself using this tool when working on a SEO project? Let me know what you think and if you would like to see any other features added to this SEO tool.

If this is something you guys would be interested in I can create a user interface for it add it to one of my sites and let the community use it for free.

Let me know what you think


**============
UPDATE
============**


So it seems some people would be interested and others are already using existing applications like screaming frog


I already was able to create a basic UI for this and will be adding it to an existing website that was started by a colleague of mine.  It will be free and also AD free (for the moment).  I currently have 2 extra dedicated servers that I will be using to host the site and run the crawls.  over the weekend I tested the crawler and was able to crawl 400 sites and generate reports for them using those 2 servers.  I will be adding daily limits to the amount of sites each user can crawl and for now I will be adding a 1


If it becomes more popular and crawls start to back up I will add more servers.  However in order to cover the cost of the additional servers I will have to put up ads =( sorry.  FYI this is just a side project of mine


If in the future this thing takes off and the community really enjoys using it

Most of the clients we have gotten have been referrals and we have not had to really do any cold calling or talk to any cold leads as most have been referred to us from friends and are existing clients who have been really happy with the results they have gotten from us so far.

However

· Does anyone have any suggestions/resources for doing a killer presentation and proposal for SEO and Social Media Services?

· Does anyone have a killer presentation or proposal they would like to white label/give/sell to us?

Basically,000 a month for services so having a tight proposal and presentation that stands out is absolutely essential. I know we can do a great job handling the workload and our team has been terrific so far.
Also, or words of wisdom would be extremely appreciated! Thanks. ",,False,,t5_2qhbx,False,,

I launched http://supplementnerd.com last Wednesday (before Thanksgiving actually) and did the following:

-Bought a domain I liked
-Bought a cheap hosting package I liked
-Bought a theme I liked
-Installed WP and the theme
-Added some plugins and created Twitter, Stumble and Delicious accounts
-Used curation and creative writing to publish about 7 articles or so
-Used Yoast to optimize
-Added some other bells and whistles

Even though I am not targeting ""cross fit"" I do include it in some things and within 7 days I am on front street on Yahoo.

Nothing epic but I thought I would share some stuff I have done with Reddit. I am open to Q/A and also suggestions!

So here are my questions..

1) Will having a link from a high page rank site like forbes.com really help? I do have several other backlinks

2) I've been working on my local seo

Kind of like in this picture:

Does it just take time?

3) How many keywords can I realistically go after?  My business performs around 10 KEY services. Is going after 10 keywords going to hurt my changes of ranking highly? or should I be focusing on fewer?



4 ) I also have a couple of other domains that I bought about 3 years ago and ran with some friends. We are no longer actively updating the site nor selling the product we used to on those sites. The 2 sites in questions had a fair amount of back links.  THe only problem

We have setup webmaster tools, changed passwords, scanned the database for javascript injections and, scanned the files for malicious content. We have even contacted google, without much help.

Could it be that malicious content is not on our website

Thanks in advance for any pointers!


UPDATE: 
I found that the site has been compromised through a 777 permission setting and I found out how they got more files on it. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3328235/how-does-this-giant-regex-work.
Working on figuring out quite how they did it.

UPDATE2:
I found out that cracker gained access and installed some kind of cache that loads a ""custom"" copy of the site when the user agent contains googlebot. I'm trying to figure out what exactly it is.

UPDATE3:
I found the uploaded code. It was cleverly hidden as an image include in the index.php file. Only when I clicked that image it wasn't an image

**I used a similar pattern for page titles

In the past I used a very generic

    Page Name » Site Name

Which would end up being something like

    Get a Quote » Random Company

Lately

    Get a [keyword] Quote from Random Company

Questions:

* Am I on the right track?
* Do I need to stay under the 70 character limit or just make sure the important stuff is before the 70 mark?
* Is there a character limit for link titles and image alts?
* Should I even include the company name? Or would it make more sense to focus on what keywords are most important and figure if somebody is searching for the company name it will take care of itself?
* Do link title tags matter that much?
* Or is the text/image that is linked that is important?
* Should I follow the same general rules for all three?
* Should I use a different methodology if a link is going on-site or off-site?
* Should the title describe the text linked or the page it is linked to?
* Good idea to plug some keywords into the slug? (/get-keyword-quote instead of /get-quote)
* Do I need to approach link titles in menus differently than those in the copy?

So

I'm just trying to do my best for my clients and feel like I'm guessing most times. Thank you.

* Submitting Twitter to WeFollow

I thought I knew all the important things to do in SEO until I hit a wall. None of my efforts are bringing any organic traffic on the website I am trying to create and grow (I am a developer).
This is the link towards my website: http://bit.ly/crxixT

I need your suggestions for what to do next. (Please don't suggest to write great content

Here is what I have done so far: (Might give some ideas to other people)


::::::::: On-page

- Submitted a sitemap to Google

- Studied what keywords I want to target (high volume / low competition

- Have keywords in &lt;title&gt; / &lt;h1&gt; / &lt;meta description / &lt;meta keywords

- Have internal links with keywords as anchor texts

- Have a lot of content

- Have keywords in urls

- Have fresh content regularly

- Created keyword targetted articles (30 or so)

- I don't have several urls pointing to the same content

- I put nofollow attribute on links like login/logout/register and other crap

- Had the domain name for more than a year to bypass sandbox

- (I should use alt attribute on my images


:::::::: Off-page

- Used keywords in anchor texts in backlinks in adequate forums and comments

- Looked at the top PR free directories and submitted there

- Submitted to crappy directories too

- Created a Squidoo Lens

- Created a Hubpage

- Created a Wordpress blog / Blogger blog / Tumblr blog / identi.ca account with tag noindex

UPDATE: All blogs receive same content as website. But they are marked as noindex.

- Submitted some pages to Digg / StumbleUpon

- Subscribed to keywords in Google Alerts to find blogs where to comment

- Looked for websites that gave backlinks to my competitors

- (I haven't done any article marketing yet)

::::::::::::::::::::

What else should I do? What am I doing wrong?

Thank you everyone.

There are too many people spouting about “writing great content” and “getting social media buzz going” but the truth of the matter is that they’re all talking out of their arse. People in the know are too afraid to share their techniques for fear of losing their ranks or getting their site sandboxed.

Well, you’re going to have to get your hands dirty.

What nobody will ever tell you is that in order to get top ranks for your friendly local accountants firm you have to enter the dark side. White hat is great in theory, no matter what you try to do to build links to your site, you will be using a technique that isn’t approved by Google at some point or another.

The “holier than thou” Matt Cutts will talk about guidelines and best practices when in reality he is there to distract you from what’s really going on.

If you’re reading this

* A cog in the machine at a marketing agency where your boss doesn’t understand the first thing about SEO and demands results for 15 clients all vying for insanely difficult terms without giving you enough budget to do anything
* A marketing manager bullshitting your way through your day – let’s face it
* A designer or programmer and you’ve been given the job of getting your company website ranked – you have no idea where to begin and you think it’s unfair you’ve been given this task
* A business owner who thinks they can do it by themselves – stop deluding yourself

So Padiwan

So, add me as a friend and wait for the aftermath.

* Social Media Galore - Owning our branded name across all sites. Currently we do not have ANY of our social media sites appearing in the top 10

* Link Wheel for Facebook, tumblr, soup.io, posterous - I'm going to try to push up our YouTube, Facebook and Twitter on these more so than the actual content on our main site.

i'd like to ask you for a little advice:

I set up an online shop for my mothers *housewares retail store* (we 
currently only ship to germany).
I've automated quantity- &amp; price-updates which happen on a daily basis. 
(Basically a cronjob that executes a php script
and processes an email with an csv-attachment

There are currently over 3200 products in approximately 300 categories.
This is dauntingly massive if you consider building landing pages for
each of these or writing supportive content.
Additionaly getting good backlinks is not that easy.
I've read a lot about SEO and i've tried to act regarding whereever i
could
therefore can't do it all at once.

Therefore i am looking for other ways to make an noticeable impact in
gaining more visitors
As i/we couldn't spare the time to calculate proper/better prices we
currently sell all articles at the *recommended retail price*
sure is one bad factor for sales

Is beeing listed in non-free-directories like yahoo or similar worth
the money?
What should i do next? What could be done with low-efforts but high-
impact? 

I (and my mom and my dad and my 2 brothers and my 2 sisters and everyone
i know and everyone you know) would be really happy if you would help me 
out with some experienced insights.

I'd like to simply throw money at this problem
spare much at the moment :/

About you: You are a nice and charming person. Additionally i find you very attractive and honor your humble but striving mind.

Rather than relying on a standard Google search to find a site's competitors I've been choosing popular products from the site's inventory and searching for them.

I seem to find a much wider variety of competitor sites by doing this. I keep a note of them all with catch.com or in a spreadsheet.

Once I've exhausted this avenue I then do more product searches

When the list has a decent amount of competitor sites I open SEO Spyglass and stick them in one-by-one. It goes and finds the relevant backlinks and checks the PR and number of links of each one. This usually takes about 20 mins. It then divides the page's PR by it's number of links to give me the 'Link Value' of each page. 

It's surprising how low the link value can often be for a PR2 or PR3 page because of the number of links. I know this is basic stuff

I then pick the best pages and add my links. I know this isn't exactly cutting edge, and I find the whole thing interesting. You guys have helped me immensely, by the way, and I'm very grateful.

Seo Spyglass is about $100 but can be found for *cough* blackhatworld *cough* free.

Would be interested to get any feedback about this or any tips or techniques you guys may have. Let's all share one nugget. It's a fucking big world

So those related to the service that I'm using, if they find us - we'll provide a free listing for them in our ""Favorite Local Sites"" - maybe a quick blurb as well.

I've put up pages with some basic on page optimization (page title, alt text, and so on) and they can rank on page 1 of the appropriate SERPs without more than a paragraph of text or any back links.

I've put up pages with nothing but two pictures and literally no text except for a header that can rank within the first two pages. Again

These are pretty soft keywords that don't seem to require much work to get ranking + traffic.

Then

**None of these pages have a 1000 blog post about these products.** 

My case is unique as is everyone else here. For me, a paragraph about the product, owners' manuals and diagrams all in PDF format, and h1 + h2 text, and page titles. It's a solid mix of content that people actually interact with and can use versus just a lengthy wall of text.

**The information that people are looking for isn't necessarily what you can write an essay about.** Sometime all people want to see is a picture of how beautiful the product's stainless steel finish is or the warm glow of lights from its face. Maybe they just need a video of how this service makes their lives more comfortable. Maybe they just ultimately need a phone number to call and talk to someone.

Of course

It would take an insane amount of time to do that.

I'm not saying writing insightful blog posts doesn't help or is a waste of time at all. But not everything on the internet deserves 1000 words extolling the incremental improvement in features and quality of product X5 over product X3.

* Label categories on the sidebar (I've left this as normal). There's about 15 labels in total. These labelled categories will list posts that have been tagged as such. Sometimes
* A typical archive list on the sidebar (this list is getting larger and larger as time goes on because it basically displays a link to every single post I've ever created).

What I've done so far:

I recently added ""noindex, a February archive page, a March archive page and so on. It will then list all posts that were published during those months under the relevant monthly archive. Problem I noticed: This would lead to duplicate content and in some cases, visitors were landing on the archive pages instead of the actual posts.

Suspicions:

* I should probably add a ""noarchive, which means that Google might penalize me for duplicate content. For example, if I make a post and list it under 4 labels, that means that Google will come across the exact same content on 5 different pages. Surely, that's not a good thing?

Hopefully you can help me. The problem is that a close friend of mine had an incident a couple of years ago. He went through a real nasty divorce which went through court and it really took it's toll on him. 

One time during the court hearings he failed to show up and the judge convicted him on contempt of court. So he got arrested and was brought to the hearing. A mugshot was taken.

Now a couple of years ago the state he resides in made all arrest records public and websites like mugshot.com started to sprout. Now when you google his name the mugshot is usually the #1 or #2 link.

I do realize he made a mistake by not showing up

You can ask the website to remove the mugshot but it's really expensive because the site basically charges lawyer fees for it.

Do you guys have any ideas or is this a lost fight? What I'm trying to accomplish is to move the mugshot website to maybe page 2-3 on Google.

Thank you so much

If the blog was for status updates (like a blog on a major e-commerce site) then it would make sense to have separate hosting in case the main site is down. The blog I want to add is not for this purpose. It does not have to be the ""voice"" of the company. This is purely to get more link juice.

Therefore: subfolder is the only thing that makes sense. Even if I create a subdomain and then link to the main domain from there

The company is a small non-profit in central Florida of health care clinics; www.chcfl.org is our site.  The site was originally built by an outside marketing company who did no SEO work and I've been put in place to manage the site


So far I've...


-Added or claimed all of our locations (9) on the top mapping and local search sites; Yelp, Google Places, Bing Places, Localeeze, Infogroup.  With most of these site's i've tried to add as much information to each individual locations page without keyword stuffing.  Mainly trying to keep consistency of the business across the whole internet

-Removed a few incorrect listing on google maps that had our old phone #'s

-Setup our facebook, pintrist and linkedin and actively post 5-10 posts on the more popular ones a week to draw in customers.  (facebook.com/chcfl.org)

-Installed SEO Yoast and went through a few pages on our website

-Redesigned a few pages on our website that were getting the most traffic to include more useful content and photos. 

-Sorted through a lot of the images on our site


Thats about all I can think of at the moment,000 hits a month for the past 6 months.  Most of these changes were done in the past two months.  We've met with a few marketing companies the past few weeks that swear they can get us drastic increase in site traffic but we're a non-profit and cant really afford to use a marketing company.


Can I get some opinions or advice on what im doing wrong?  What needs to be fixed or shouldn't exist at all?  I know &lt;h1&gt; tags need work and a few pages on our site are in drastic need of content.  I also think that our Google Places listings are probably getting down ranked for keyword stuffing


On our location pages, so I believe this is something I need to fix, BUT are these even good H1 tags?  Should it just be ""Eatonville""?  We're mainly trying to get traffic to each locations individual page so patients can see that community clinics for medicaid and medicare patients arnt always ugly and using old equipment.

I also noticed that if I try and make a google+ page for a business using one of my me@domain.com google accounts it requires me to join google+ first and wants name, etc, so maybe the best practice would be to have one google+ account for authorship and setting up google+ pages..

I was chatting to a friend earlier today who has a site that has been on page 1 in Google's organic search results since the beginning of time.  After penguin came in, nothing has been done.  The fall in rank also coincided with him retaining a new SEO - in the course of one of their conversations

I ran the site through Backlink Watch and compared it to his competitors - he has about 3, directories etc and high quality/PR/relevance sites.  

Any chance someone could confirm my suspicion that his backlink profile is the cause of his demise or whether there could be another issue?  Any ideas as to how to turn it around?  I'm a total SEO amateur so the only thing I can think of is removing each listing in directories

1336597095.0,tfb5d,A bit of advice starting an SEO digital marketing internship and the first week is not what I expected....,thrillho111,8,0,32,"So after graduating from university and taking care of an ill family member for most of the last year, I decided to try and make this a career and do something that has given me a lot of pleasure in my leisure time. 

So I started the internship last week. I've been slowly learning basics on my own up to now, such as basic computer tech stuff like HTML but I'm getting their slowly as I can see it is quite a bit essential especially when looking at websites and advising what can be changed (I'm able to pick up things from just appearance at the moment). I studied English and Media, so I do not have a computing background (so any advice on things to read or look at to get me up to speed at a level that is at least satisfactory would be of much help). 

Anyway, I can tell that this isn't right and I understand that it is a slow and steady process to get results for anyone in SEO and social media.

My boss seems a bit flighty and while planning a wedding

The internship goes on till the end of July so I'm confident that I still have ages to learn new things and it HAS only been the first week and a bit. I'm not getting coffee or doing many of the usual remedial tasks that an internship usually consists of

I'm not sure what the point of this post is. I think partly to ask for advice or ask if there is something I should watch out for. Has anyone else had previous bad experience within companies who are not exactly using White Hat strategies or are kosher? Also is there anything I ought to be reading/listening to as far as starting out and keeping updated in the world of SEO and social media? I already listening to SEO 101 and SEO Advisor while I work so I am making the most of my day. I've already made up my mind that, I'll make it known that I do as I don't want to be pressured into doing something that will come back to me and I'll be blamed for.

Anything I should be listening to/reading?
Anything to cover the detailed techy stuff such as HTML to get me to an OK level.
Should I be worried or is this just another case of starting out in an industry and ""paying dues""?
Anything I should watch out for?
Am I asking the right questions or is there anything I've missed?

This post is a bit all over the place I know; I guess I just have quite a bit on my mind at the moment.
Thanks in advance

Many people were laid off and the guy that set up the Google Adwords turned it over to me before he quit. I have been reading books, I think that we had an idiot running the Adwords, but the owners aren't tech savvy by a long shot. But I digress.  

I have watched the free StomperNet videos, blackhat/whitehat techniques etc. I can't say I understand everything, but I can say that I am desperate to try to use the *much smaller* ad budget to get more people to the site, which directly correlates to people in the door and conversions.

If things don't turn around, no one noticed the inefficiency of the previous guy.  Now I said I'd take this on and my co-workers are counting on me to get this in order to boost sales and keep our jobs.

Our company has used Elance and Vworker to do work for us, you obviously didn't get it. If I wanted to use them for SEO, I am too ignorant of SEO/SEM to know what I am asking for specifically. I can't just say give me customers. We get 5 calls a week from local SEO companies that want more than our ad budget to help us, so that just isn't an option.

Here's the data:
I've worked with two different websites that have, if you know what I mean).

The first (pre-penguin 1) received a notice and then we noticed that all the sites for their major keyword (a keyword which is competitive in their niche but not overall extremely competitive) shifted around in the SERPs

The second (post-pengun 2) received a notice and all the serps for their major keyword shifted (this keyword is much more competitive and filled with some pretty aggressive spammers). One of their closest competitors in particular fell very fast. According to Majestic's data that competitor in particular was removing links like mad (losing 4000 in a week) which suggests that they were ""renting"" those links (not only because they could remove them so quickly but because it was one of those circumstances where you ask your self, to me, that they might have gotten a notice as well.

Here's my theory: 
When Google sends a notice to a website for unnatural links it not only checks that sites backlinks but determines their most important keywords. It then puts the whole serps for that keyword under scrutiny. Not only does this mean other sites might also receive notices (hence the shakeup in the serps I noticed each time) but also increases the money Google can make from Adwords (as companies attempt to buy traffic to make up the difference they lose from organic search).

Now we know Google's motto is ""do no evil (to your investors)"" so anti-spam efforts to raise revenue from Adwords makes sense and is an obvious move for them. At the same time tt seems to me that a great way for Google to catch spammers is to attack areas for which they are focusing on. It's a way for them to stop the ""arms race"" that sometimes happens in the serps- one person spams and dominates so everyone else has to be more aggressive to compete.

One of my clients is paying nearly a grand a moth for link building and so far he's got very few links (albeit on very targeted sites for his industry) with very little page rank.  By very little I mean from 0 to 2.  

Questions:

How important is page rank nowadays?  I know it used to be the be-all-and-end-all.  They’ve been working on the site for 4 months now and last month I had a total of only 7 links!  I’m due to speak with them tomorrow about their performance and want to know if I should start to kick ass.
