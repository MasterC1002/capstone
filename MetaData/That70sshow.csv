At this point in my life I am deeply in love with my SO after only a short period of time and I am finding Eric extremely relate able. I have just watched the last few episodes of season 3 and the first couple of season 4. Now I am warning you now there are going to be some spoilers so please decide for yourself if you want to continue.


So as you know this is around when Eric and Donna break up. Eric is so crushed by the loss of Donna so much that he gives up on life
   Now at this point I should say that one thing I did envy was the relationship that Eric and Red had because my relationship with my father is terrible. And I secretly wish it were much better.
   So Red buys him a beer and tells him the story of his first real heartbreak. And then The waterworks started I was sobbing like a little baby

We know that Eric and a few others jokingly say that she's evil throughout the series, the Lord of Darkness.  

Fact: She was born with a tail.

Fact: in ""Red Gets A Job"" she has Kelso look into her eyes to see images of Satan.

Fact: Eric mentions a neighborhood child who was abducted for use in ""one of Laurie's black masses.""

Fact: Eric and Donna seem genuinely surprised that she shows emotion and concern for someone other than herself.

Fact: St Peter seems to know Laurie in Kitty's daydream in episode ""Holy Crap"" and seems tempted by her. She then flashes an evil/mischievous grin. 

Fact: She changes her appearance after season 5 and no one notices.

Fact:  In ""Holy Crap"" she tries to tempt a holy man

Next, I really didn't miss him. I feel like he turned into a huge douche, all season long. I also don't feel like his character really does change much, through the entire series.

**Kelso**

Overall though, they both grew up a lot. I also liked seeing more of Hyde. His stripper wife got annoying eventually, but she left. And his Dad is always a riot.

**What do you guys think?**

**TL;DR:** Randy isn't that bad

*I'm hoping we can get some more conversation going in this subreddit
