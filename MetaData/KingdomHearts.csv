Long story short:

Aqua from BBS gave me my spark back after my mother died of breast cancer. I finally feel like myself again after years of deep depression. 

Long story:


I originally picked up Kingdom Hearts for my birthday years ago when I was younger. Like many of you


Around the time Chain of Memories came out, due in no small part because of the influence of Sora’s continuously optimistic outlook, I took it in stride. It was early enough to be treatable and, despite some hard times ahead we would get through it. 


Kingdom Hearts II was the first game I ever pre-ordered. I picked that up the day of its release and controller in hand, who was always very sensitive, and my parents’ marriage. The fights I overheard were incredible. My father even confided in me that he was thinking of divorcing my Mom at one point. While it fortunately never came to pass, it was a terrifying thought. So, I dove into Kingdom Hearts. There, life was a struggle, and dark and downright depressing. But you just moved through it. And Sora’s journey kept me sane.


As time went on, I lost my memory card. It was a bit of a hit and I didn’t want to start over, so I left the series for a while. I still haven’t gotten around to finishing it...


Having a DS, because I was beginning university I didn’t get much time to play it. I chose to study Biomedical science, so my free time was very sparse. It also remains unfinished. I really fell away from the series after that.


Since then


In the summer of 2010, one of the results was a false negative. It was in her bones, and this time there was nothing they could do but buy time. We were given 5 to 20 years, which is short enough to worry about, but too vague to know exactly when it would happen. This threw us all for a loop and I started spending more time at home. 


But


All the while though, all my achievements were hollow, and I was emotionally disconnected from my family and friend. And this only worsened over time.


In September of 2012, after 3 weeks of the most unbearable misery anyone should have to endure, she passed away on October 9. She survived only two and a half years instead of the minimum of five we were promised at the start. 


I wanted to stay strong during all this and, I buried my emotions and only released them when I was alone. But, the apathy I had for her passing spread towards my studies. I was half-assing my work and only I started to not care if I passed or not. I had no motivation to work or to do much of anything but stare at a wall for hours on end. I wanted to drop out mere months from graduation.


It was in one of these bouts of boredom that I decided to look up Birth By Sleep. Lacking a PSP
 She reminded me a lot of... well... me. As cliché as it sounds, but defensively very weak. She also relies on brain over brawn.

There are a number of other traits too


She is given nothing but negative feedback in her travels. Her one goal, in the end, Terra was dead as far she knew and Ventus was in a permanent coma.  She could have left Ventus in Yen Sid’s care. She could have just gone on her way as a Keyblade Master should, and just treated them both as memories. But she didn’t. She stayed and finished what she started. She used her knowledge to shelter Ven. She even saved Terra using a tactic that she didn’t know would work or not. 


But... in the end she was stuck in darkness. The same as me. Her four lines of dialogue in there snapped me back to who I was.


&gt;“I feel like I’ve been walking for ages. How long have I been down here?”
 
Perfectly described my feelings ever since my mother’s terminal diagnosis in 2010. It was almost as if I was always this way; Disconnected and alone.

&gt; “Maybe...I should fade into the darkness here.”

It reflected my deep sense of surrender I felt since then. Why should I bother continuing to study medicine? It’s not going to help anyone. As well as every other dark thought that I ever had


Then...that moment. Light in the darkness.

&gt; “I guess it's been so long

 During her flashback sequences, happy smiles since October. 


&gt;""There's always a way.""

 Her words resonated perfectly in a way I can’t describe. Just because darkness is everywhere it doesn’t mean I have to give in to it.  And for the first time in nearly two years


Aqua saved me from... me. Her story restored me to who I was before all this happened. It was hope. Not Sora’s corny


Since then, and I'm looking forward to my graduation. I'm running on all cylinders for the first time in recent memory. I've been through too much, and I'm still standing. I'm not stopping now. Aqua didn't succumb to the darkness and I won't either.

What I have learned is the Guardian is in fact Terra. People say that this is just a apart of Xehanort's powers

Now, but what was inside him. It is true Xehanort wanted a new vessel so he could live longer, but he could've chosen anyone. He chose Terra not for his strength, but the immense power hidden inside him. Now, it is relevant that Master Xehanort never summoned the Guardian in his original state hinting it was not his power to begin with, only after Aqua confronts him as Terra-Xehanort does he summon it. 
    
What I have concluded is, he pushed Terra's heart out of his body which would create the Guardian. This would also explain the way Xehanort/Ansem position themselves when they summon him. They cross their arms as if the put them in a position where they won't just hang there. When the Guardian is summoned they have full control over it, as in they stop motion in there own arms so they could control its arms. Also take into the fact that it's mouth is covered in bandage perhaps from Xehanort's doing to prevent it from talking. This could prove Xehanort has full control over Terra's darkness while he can only watch. 
    

During certain scenes there is shown conflict between the Guardian and the user which add the proof of the Guardians identity. 

* The battle scene right after Xehanort first summons it and before he and aqua fight, a point a which Xehanort is in control. Now, after the battle Terra has begun fighting over control over his own body, **note** the Guardian had already disappeared at this point. During that conflict Xehanort had won by locking his heart and stopping Terra, and caused him to loses his keyblade in the process. At that moment Xehanort was weak enough for Terra to summon himself as the Guardian. I believe he purposefully opened the portal to try to take his body to the Realm of Darkness to prevent any more harm. But Aqua saved him and was trapped there instead. 

* The only form in which Xehanort can summon the Guardian is ""Terranort"" and Ansem SOD. Every other form of Xehanort has not had Terra's heart in it, Terra's and Xehanort's heart were in one vessel and when they separated, Xemnas could not access Terra's heart and Xemnas mind had full control because Terra's mind was in his armor.

* Terra's ceremony with Riku had always stayed true

* During Dream Drop Distance after their battle between Riku and Ansem with Guardian


This is what I have concluded from playing all the games. The last point really made me think about it and I came to this as my answer. The Guardian is Terra's heart and darkness.

In the first game, Destiny Islands were swallowed by darkness. We see first in traverse town, and later throughout the story as he falls more and more to the darkness through Malificent’s influence (remember the scenes with Pinocchio). We see him working with the villains, all for Kairi. He rightfully views Sora’s adventure as a childish waste of time, and takes the burden of Kairi’s rescue to himself. He eventually steals the Keyblade and even allows Ansem to use his body, (basically selling his soul to Satan). But the worlds are saved by Sora, and Riku pays the ultimate price by being locked away in kingdom hearts. His final words are “take care of her.”

When he is given half the story in Chain of Memories, eventually comes head to head against Ansem, and accepts his darkness as part of himself. He decides to use the darkness for a righteous cause: 

Riku: What are you making me choose now? 

DiZ: Between the road to light and the road to darkness. 

Riku: Neither suits me. I'm taking the middle road. 

DiZ: Do you mean the twilight road to nightfall? 

Riku: No. It's the road to dawn.

Riku ends the game so much stronger than he begins it. He grows up

It is such a wonderful story that it could not end; In 356/2 days, urging her to make the choice that would be the best for everyone. Riku continues working with DIZ and Namine to basically jumpstart the story again. He even accepts his fate of using Ansem’s power when he beats Roxas. 

In Kingdom Hearts 2, utilizing his dark powers to help Sora. In the final battle, players get to control him with a few limited functions. He is wounded, but manages to make it home with Sora. 

In 3DS, dark splicer, dark roll, and dark barrier, which are some of his best attacks. Finally, Riku saves Sora from Xehanort and beats Ansem one last time for shits and giggles. At the current part in the story, Riku is now the leader of the keyblade wielders

His character growth is amazing. From best friend to enemy to Satan’s lackey

Compare this all to Sora, and is in this way a classic hero. Sora is simply dragged along for the ride, and accepts his destiny rather easily. Kairi was not even an issue in his mind until Riku brought it up at traverse town, then in monstro, then on Captain Hook’s ship – he was simply going from world to world defeating evil. His lowest point in the series (nadir) was at the entrance to Hollow Bastion in KH1, when Riku takes the keyblade in the ultimate betrayal. But even here, Sora just says “I’ve come too far to give up now, but remove the all-important backstory. That is Sora. 

Riku is a very human character, and maybe even surpassed Xehanort, who became so corrupted that he is the main villain. In fact, Riku may be one of the best written modern video game characters because we see him fall due to noble intentions, and his rise back up to where he was always meant to be.

Hello, however, we feel it's time for a bit of discussion in terms of the policies we enforce on the subreddit, and we want to know what you, the user, want.

 Currently, these two sites have not been playing nice ever since they've started posting on the subreddit: they've been suspected of vote gaming (with the mods receiving messages from each side accusing the other on different occasions); and they definitely use the subreddit as a way to increase page views (which is no crime, but is occurring at the expense of other users and sites being able to post their own content here). Often they race to be the first to post their link in order to avoid being caught by the spam filter or having one of the mods remove their link from the page (we often get up to 4 or 5 links with the same information at any given time). Personally, I have liked the fact that they provide access to informative news content like translated interviews, which is always good to balance the amount of image posts and fan videos that get on the front page every day. However, I wonder if this is the best model for the subreddit to run on.


So we're going to ask you guys what you think we should do. 

Here are some options:

1. Do nothing

2. Remove the post that is submitted second regardless of which was upvoted more. -This is what we've been doing in the past

3. Ban both users with the warning that if we ever suspect gaming the subreddit again that user will be banned while encouraging non partisan users to submit the news from their prefered site.

4. Blacklist both sites and tell users to find their KH info from somewhere else (possibly offer to put both links in the sidebar as severance).


5. Ban all blog and news sites and run a mod submitted news circle. This option would be very time consuming for us and we might not be as quick or efficient as the other ones. It also discourages user submissions.


Please discuss and give us feedback! Also

For anyone looking for the KH games put into movie form (I put them in chronological story order):

[Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWcrrhZB1XM)


* Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep events occur 10 years prior to Kingdom Hearts and has 3 different protagonists.


[Kingdom Hearts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QFYcuzRHSI)


* [Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ3SIAHIhJ8&amp;list=PLody2_ff0Vs7Ia7-Z-U2wQ_nKiqNCY13Y) begins during the events at the end of Kingdom Hearts when [Sora uses the Keyblade of People's Hearts to remove both his and Kairi's heart so that Kairi could be woken up


    * **Note pertinent to the length of the video:** It should be noted that the [""original"" 358/2 Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAEoejIhW8I) is a little more than 2 hours shorter, but will be coming to North America, Europe, and Australia on the PS3 later this year in September.


[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMahBvtckFs)


* Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days runs concurrently with the events of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories.

1362952144.0,1a1lo2,Uncover Your Organization XIII Name,Kuxir,55,4,195,"It came to my attention that some people have a hard time figuring out how to make their organization name

Basic formula is just your name + x i.e. Sora=Roxas

This may seem like a daunting task but the first thing to consider is that in most cases youll aim for separating the consonants as much as possible. In Roxas you see the pattern is  c v c v c (C=consonant

With c v c v c sora could also have turned into

* Sorax Sarox
* soxar saxor
* rosax rasox
* roxas raxas
* xosar xasor
* xoras xaros

This is further complicated when you have a name with 2 or more consonants than you have vowels or vice versa

Take for example the name ""Slava""
There are 3 consonants, and V and 2 vowels
c v c v c is impossible so youll go with 

* cc v c v c

&gt;A useful patter would be (lets assume the name is Slava, V=C3, X=C4, A=V1, A=V2)

&gt;C1 C2 V1 C3 V2 C4 - C1 C2 V1 C4 V2 C3 (switching last 2 Cs)

&gt;C1 C2 V2 C3 V1 C4 - C1 C2 V2 C4 V1 C3 (switching last 2 vowels)

&gt;C2 C1 V1 C3 V2 C4 - C1 C2 V1 C4 V2 C3 (switching first 2 Cs)

&gt;C1 C3 V2 C2 V1 C4 - C1 C3 V2 C4 V1 C2 (switching out a later C with C2

&gt;C2 C1 V1 C3 V2 C4 - C2 C1 V1 C4 V2 C3 (then start process with a diff C first)

* Here is an example

&gt;Slavax Slaxav

&gt;lsavax lsaxav

&gt;Svalax Svaxal

&gt;Vsalax Vsaxal 

&gt;Sxaval Sxalav

&gt;Xsaval Xsalav

&gt;Then pair the others

&gt;Lvaxas Lvasax

&gt;Vlaxas Vlasax

&gt;Lxavas Lxasav

&gt;Xlavas Xlasav

&gt;Vxasal Vxalas

&gt;Xvasal Xvalas

&gt;A smart move would be to immediatly throw out the combinations which have bad sounding consonants together

&gt;there would be 4 in each row if the vowels were diff and you would have to switch them

* c v cc v c
* c v c v cc

These are more likely to be gibberish and take longer to map out so that's why c v c v c is preffered. But even with balanced names

* cc vv c

&gt;Sroax

&gt;Sraox

&gt;Sxoar

&gt;Sxaor

&gt;etc

So my theory is that, I believe the final battle is going to be Sora vs. Xehanort with Sora wielding the X-blade, since, being neither a Guardian nor a Seeker, his heart was not used to create it. He balances the light and darkness in his own heart, making the X-blade choose him instead of *DARKNESS*-obsessed Xehanort.

Now. In BBS, so I started replaying KH1 last night and I got to like the introductory dream 'this is how you play the game' type part when thought popped in my head.

The voice that's like telling Sora what to do and like the whole ""Don't be afraid. You hold the mightiest weapon of all"" and all that. Not like the directions but the voice of whoever is talking to Sora. Well at the part where you're choosing your alignment (strength

Now maybe I'm taking this a little far-fetched (and also haven't slept in a few days) but is it possible that it could be Ven's voice? Like he's technically within Sora right? Thats why Roxas looked so much like him nd whatnot. So it wouldn't be too far of a stretch since it seems like SquareEnix is usually pretty good about having most the storyline before making all the games. I mean Sora talked to Ventus in the same sort of way in the beginning of BBS as well. I don't know. Maybe I'm overthinking it,False,self,t5_2s3jo,False,,Ultima2,t3_1afg96

While doing a 7th playthrough of the series to date, and see what games fill in what details, and in the end, we can come to our opinions and share in the comments what you think I missed or perhaps why you feel I am wrong.


Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days.

This game gets a lot of flack for ""Not bringing anything new"" and ""Not pushing the story in any forward direction."" and most importantly ""You want me to buy another console to continue the series?!"" While I agree that they really need to stop putting these games out each on a separate console, who we later find out is Sora's Nobody from his time as a Heartless. I'm going to skip the first 5 days of the tutorial because it is just that, tiny bits of story with a lot of learning. But the sixth day is different. As we walk through Roxas' shoes, we learn little about who he really is, and KH2 would leave us with that. The moment when he stands before Sora and realizes it is over for him means little because this is a character we only knew for two hours. 358 changes that. We learn more about the Organization, Roxas, and Axel in 358 than we do in any other game and while this may not seem like a big deal


Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep

This game is well known for being great to I will keep this one fairly short. BBS at first looks to be just another delay and side story that fails to tie in with the rest of the series, best game play, and most interesting protagonists! Ven, Tera, and Aqua are arguably the best keyblade wielders simply because their story is one that is constantly pressed forward, even when they do not appear in the games. BBS explains where each of the new trio got their keyblades (Even if they do not expressly say it for two of them.) and explains where the villain of the series, xehanort came from. It shows the eternal struggle of light vs dark and expands on the KH universe


Kingdom Hearts: Coded

Okay, we will keep it short. This game is really more of a sequel to BBS than any game but takes place after KH2. This game is fairly important in the aspect of Ven's heart. At the very end of this drawn out and rather boring plot, we find out that hidden within the page's of Jimney's Journal, Namine has hidden the location of Ven's heart. While they could have done this far better, at least we know that we will see this expanded upon.


Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance

This game gets way more flack than it should, not to gather and open Kingdom Hearts to gain hearts, but instead to give power to the enemy, xehanort. Not only this but to become darkness itself and have 13 little xehanort clones running about! It explains the true clash of the 7 lights and 13 darks. Plus it has a conversation between Roxas and Sora which has always been something I've wanted... Oh and the characters from the best DS game of all time, The World Ends with You. Most people did not like the game play, which is totally within their right, but I found the flow motion to be fun. Story wise, I think not.


In conclusion (because I've already given you all a wall of text to read) most of these spin off games are not to delay us or simply keep KH fever going, giving beginnings to the series, and setting up for the next game in a way that does for feel rehashed. Every game adds something new to the plot and in my opinion, expands on the universe that is Kingdom Hearts... Except you Coded... you get out of here.",,False,self,False,t3_1fzrp4

1338856264.0,ul6y3,I wrote all this up as a summary to the entire series in another forum and thought you guys might appreciate it.  SPOILERS,electrikyle,47,7,17,"**Birth By Sleep:**

Old man Xehanort doesn't want to die, Terra, and Aqua go on a journey and pass their abilities to children named Sora, Riku, and Kairi. Old man Xehanort possesses Terra's body but loses his memory and ends up an apprentice of a scientist named Ansem. Ventus's spirit ends up in Sora's heart.

**Kingdom Hearts:**

Sora, Kairi loses her heart, and Sora ends up transforming himself into a Heartless to restore Kairi's heart (just go with it). They eventually defeat Maleficent and find the man behind the curtain, ""Ansem."" However.. Ansem is ACTUALLY Xehanort's heartless and has just borrowed his former mentor's name. ""Ansem"" is obliterated by the doorway to Kingdom Hearts. On the other side of the door is... King Mickey, who has been missing the entire game. Riku decides to go with him on the other side of the door, while Sora promises to stay behind and protect Kairi.

**Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (Part 1):**

It turns out, walk, talk, and look exactly like their pre-nobody counterparts; only they don't have hearts and therefore can't feel emotions. The strongest Nobodies have a club called Organization XIII, and their mission is to collect hearts for Kingdom Hearts, 
in the hopes that they can reclaim their hearts and be complete again. Their leader is Xemnas (an anagram of Ansem+X), who was created (but not shown) when Sora made himself a Heartless in KH1. The only catch is that Roxas actually looks like Ventus - who has been residing in Sora's heart this entire time (since Birth by Sleep). After Roxas has been with the Organization for 30 days or so, about half of them leave to go to Castle Oblivion

**Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories**

Sora, and end up at Castle Oblivion. While in the castle, Sora's memory is rewritten by Kairi's Nobody, Namine, who is being used as a pawn by the Organization. One by one, the members in the castle are defeated, except for Axel (who is Roxas's best friend). Sora finally meets Namine, Donald

**Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (Part 2):**

Using Sora's memories and Roxas's power, in desperation, fights Riku, who has been submerged in (but not succumbed by) the darkness in his heart. Riku has to give into the darkness to defeat Roxas, but in doing so becomes trapped in the body of ""Ansem"" (the heartless of old man Xehanort from way back when). Roxas is captured and placed in a digitized version of the town where Sora is being kept until Sora is ready to wake up.

**Kingdom Hearts II:**

Roxas awakens in the digital town with no memory of the Organization or who he was. Eventually he finds Sora, and is attacked by what's left of the Organization. On a quest to find answers, find Riku, and save Kairi, he finally meets King Mickey, who introduces them to Ansem the Wise - the guy who took in the possessed Terra-Xehanort as his apprentice back in Birth By Sleep. Ansem the Wise has been masquerading in bandages as DiZ, and is responsible for helping restore Sora's memory. Sora and the gang discover that by defeating Heatless, but Xemnas (the organization leader) isn't ready to give up, causing the Door of Light to open and creates a pathway back to their homeworld.

**Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded**

Jiminy Cricket's journal has been corrupted by a virus, the gang goes to meet with Yensid (the wizard from Fantasia), who has discovered reason to believe that Terra, Ventus, and Aqua are still rescue-able, but to do so, Sora and Riku will have to become ""true"" Keyblade Masters (which will be the plot of KH3D).

This is pretty much where the story is currently. Ansem the Wise and Aqua (from BBS) are still trapped on the Shores of Darkness,,False,self,t5_2s3jo,False,,True

       I was around 6 when the first KH was released and even though i couldnt buy it my friend Cole did. We obsessed over it I would spend every weekend at his house playing it from friday night to sunday evening . We played the shit out of that game and he became my best friend over it. One day when i came home from his house my parents surprised me with my very own ps2 and copy of KH! I was absolutely ecstatic and so was Cole. He had already beaten it at his house and he loaned me his strategy guide. And oh god did i play that game, spending an entire night trying to kill the stealth-sneak, storming through hollow bastion and kicking Maleficents ass, Trying to flank those fat heartless. All of it came back in one tidal wave of nostalgia. And i cried reddit, I cried like a little bitch. Ive spent all day reading this guide and now i have some buisness to attend to. Im going to go kick Ansem's ass to honor our childhood spent stopping the heartless. Im sorry for all of my shitty grammar and if this is hard to read but i just wanted to share this.

If you want to play everything chronologically, and while the stories are not up to par in importance with the other titles, they are a part of the KH story line and do reveal details that will show up in other games. Chain of Memories is also technically a side story, but it is a necessary one if you want to understand many elements present in Kingdom Hearts II. Also, 358/2 Days intersects with Chain of Memories, as both happen simultaneously (with Days actually starting before and ending *after* Chain of Memories).  ",,self,Ultima2,moderator

His failures.

I don't think we have seen him have an actual failure, but I dont think I have. Sora has battled and saved worlds countless times, but thats a trial he overcomes with a smile on his face and friends by his side. I argue that for Sora to really flesh out what it means to be the best of us, we need to see him tackle the darkness alone. For any of his words to carry weight for me, there needs to be some kind of baggage weighing over his heart. 

it may sound depressing as hell

Sora then through trying to do good, if they carried another, more hidden meaning. It would be easy to manipulate Sora into acting upon it. 

SO essentially Sora ends up trying to do good, OR Sora follows a Cloud Strife sort of route and finds himself half way through. (I'm talking about the original persona of Strife from VII, not the my life is over nonstop strife of the more recent editions.)

In doing this through whatever plot is thrown, however when KH II came out, the Org was used to amp up the maturity. 

In the end all I'm saying is, with the rest of the cast making up for the dark side of the world, or should he himself experience it, have the rest of the cast support him, and then really enrich the symbolism this brilliant series has to offer!

**STORY**

The story in every KH game has been fairly well done

* Final Fantasy Characters

The last couple games (358/2, and Yuffie, but some new characters. Why not add in Batheir, and Lightening? How about some characters from older games like Terra and Bartz.

**GAMEPLAY**

* A Trio

The thing I loved most about KH1 and KH2 was the trio, and Goofy. In more recant titles we've seen that a trio (in gameplay at least) has been sorrily missed. However, how the current story has progressed, I believe it would be better to set up a different trio. Sora, Riku and, Kari. Three best friends, and three keyblade masters. This brings me to my next point

* Leveling

I have really enjoyed the leveling systems added the games such as 358/2 and BBS. I would love to see one in KH3

* The Gummi Ship

The Gummi Ship was one of my favorite parts of KH1 and KH2

**ONLINE**

Putting KH online

* Multiplayer 

358/2 tried this by allowing you to repeat missions with Organization members, and a PvP. An arena would allow players to battle challenging monsters together (not a new concept for KH, just integrated with Multiplayer) and PvP would have players duking it out against each other in several different maps.

* Customization

Assuming an Online Multiplayer was added

Just follow the black line at first. The alpha and gamma segments are when Ansem SoD and Xemnas

So here's what I think is going on:


1. Young Xehanort grows up on Destiny Islands.
2. Young Xehanort meets his future self
3. Young Xehanort gathers everyone and brings them to TWTNW in KH3D.
4. Young Xehanort goes back to his original time and forgets everything that happened in the future.
5. Young Xehanort grows up to become the Master Xehanort we've seen in Birth By Sleep.
6. Master Xehanort abandons his body and takes over Terra's.
7. Aqua fights him in Radiant Garden
8. Xehanort becomes Ansem the Wise's apprentice.
9. Ansem tells him to stop his experiments
10. Xehanort willingly gives himself over to the darkness

**Ansem

1. Time-travelling Young Xehanort brings Ansem SoD to the future.
2. Ansem SoD participates in the events of Dream Drop Distance and KH3.
3. Ansem SoD returns to his original timeline for some yet unrevealed reason and forgets what happened in the future.
4. Time-travelling Young Xehanort tells Ansem SoD about their meeting in his past (Ansem's future)

[Isa: turquoise eyes.](http://i.imgur.com/KyyXh.jpg)

[Saix... yellow eyes.](http://i.imgur.com/tErgy.jpg)

It's a little bit less clear with Braig

But Xigbar's are definitely (as we were shown in DDD) [yellow.](http://i.imgur.com/USAGd.jpg)

The obvious conclusion is that there is some connection between yellow eyes and Xehanort, the definition of a Heartless is also thrown into question. Let's leave that tidbit aside for now. 

Members of the Organization with yellow eyes: Xemnas, Vanitas, Master Xehanort, Terra-Xehanort (only the one wearing Terra's clothes created at the end of Birth by Sleep), and Young Xehanort. This could have been planned as far back as the beginning of KHII. Maleficent had yellow eyes in the movie, but not as noticeably in the games, so she's [iffy](http://i.imgur.com/6ZHkj.png).


So anyone with yellow eyes is a potential Darkness. That brings the list up to 8 (maybe 9); still short 5.


It's interesting to note that apprentice-Xehanort, as evidenced by [Blank Points](http://i.imgur.com/gWx6Q.png) *and* [the portrait in Radiant Garden.](http://i.imgur.com/Ip0NY.jpg)

In addition, his eyes are more [orange.](http://i.imgur.com/CST9G.png) Master Xehanort's eyes are [very clearly pointed out,](http://i.imgur.com/toPdC.png) and they are not very similar to Ansem's.


This might also lead us in new directions searching for the lights--perhaps Lea, Kairi, Xion, Namine, Roxas, Ven, Aqua, but this is one too many. Namine's are different from the rest

1349162677.0,10t1v2,A bunch of assorted questions about the KH story (Spoilers inside),Amablue,33,5,65,"Why did Kingdom Hearts show up in the keyblade graveyard during that fight at the end of BBS? Was that the real KH? 

Why did Sora need to use the keyblade forged from the heart of the Princesses to get Kairi's Heart out himself? Why couldn't he use his own keyblade to do that?

When he stabbed himself with that keyblade

Why did Mickey have to go away prior to KH1? He already had a keyblade.

Whats the difference between the Lanes Between and the Corridors of Darkness? Or are they just different names for the same thing?

If Roxas is Sora's body

When Terra-Xehanort aka Ansem, what happened to the body? It became Xemnas right? What happened to Terra's heart, which should have still been residing in the body? Shouldn't Terra have regained control of himself at that point?

Why does killing Ansem at the end of KH1 restore the worlds?

The worlds that Sora visted in DDD were worlds that were consumed by heartless at one point but have since been restored due to Sora's efforts - Why then do you visit Traverse Town and The Mysterious Tower? Those worlds were never consumed. 

Why does the door to kingdom hearts lead to the world of darkness? How does Riku end up there?

Was that even the real kingdom hearts? What is Kingdom Hearts? 

Why did Ven go to Sora's heart after the battle with Vanitas in his mind? Since he became whole

When Young Xehanort was collecting the various iterations of himself from different points in time, and he only existed in that form for a relatively short period of time - did he swing by between Riku getting consumed by darkness and Sora showing up to defeat him?

Also in DDD

When they were visiting worlds in DDD

If Xehanort didn't lose his memory after the fight with Aqua in BBS

How did DiZ end up in the World of Darkness after his death? I thought he exploded.

Roxas

Why did Roxas and Naminé have to merge with Sora and Kairi? What purpose did that serve? They were already their own beings with their own existences (And apparently their own hearts too)

--After showing a new CGI introduction, and asks them who that could've been. Their eyes widen, and Yen Sid says ""Riku, I believe Sora was not the only one you had awaken from a deep sleep...""

--We're then brought to Castle Oblivion, his eyes open. After looking around for a minute, he realizes he has no memories. Ventus then gets out of the chair, and starts walking towards a door. Once on the other side of the door, the door vanishes and we see that he is standing in the same room where Sora had fought Marluxia.

--As he aimlessly wanders the 13th floor
""Well isn't this a nice surprise. They told me that the room you've been asleep in has been impossible to find; glad to see you've saved me the trouble of looking for it"".
Ventus
""Yeah...they also told me that you'd need help getting your memories back
The two then walk towards the staircase leading to the 12th floor.
""In order to retrieve all of your memories
The man then pushes Ventus towards the stairs.

--*12th floor:*
Ventus is suddenly in Twilight Town, and begins to explain to Ventus what a Keyblade is and how he could use it to travel to many different worlds. He then offers to make Ventus his pupil.
Ventus is then standing in the middle of a desert

Ventus is then back in Castle Oblivion
""So you've remembered how to summon a Keyblade. Well congratulations...now keep going

--*11th floor:*
Ventus and Master Xehanort are seen sitting in the mansion in Twilight Town. Xehanort is teaching Ventus about the darkness within everyone's hearts
Ventus is then back in the desert with Master Xehanort, [which leads into a remastered version of this cut-scene.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOK2BeHVhTU)
We're then shown Master Xehanort carrying Ventus's unconscious body through Destiny Island

Back to Castle Oblivion...
""Master Xehanort....why would he do that to me?""
""Because you're weak. You weren't strong enough to handle your darkness, things right now would be a whole lot different.""
""W-What does that mean?""
""Never mind that. Now make your way to the 10th floor
""Wait...who was the boy that saved me that night?""
""You'll find out soon enough. Now

--*10th floor:*
Master Xehanort is seen walking Ventus through the Land of Departure
Time goes by
We're then shown a rapid succession of scenes from Birth By Sleep.

Before Ventus appears back in Castle Oblivion
“So how's he doin'?”
“Fine. What are you doing here? Don't you have your own work to be doing?”
“As if, where'd you find him? Our old crew searched this place for days and couldn't find a trace of him.”
“Your old 'crew' was also filled with weaklings
“HA! Can't argue with that!”
“...I found him just walking around the Castle
Suddenly, anxious to find out what happened to his friends”.
“I guess that's my cue to go.”
The other cloaked man then summons a Dark Corridor

--*9th floor:*
More flash-backs to BBS are shown

--*8th floor:*
We're shown more rapid-successions of scenes from Birth By Sleep
The last few scenes of BBS are then shown

In Castle Oblivion...
“I...I remember everything! Terra...Aqua...I have to find them!”
“Ha! It's been over 10 years since that battle in the desert. Your friends are long-gone; they just dropped your worthless body off in this Castle
“Shut up! Terra and Aqua would never forget about me! Even if Terra lost his memory to the darkness
“You really are naive. I can guarantee you that the Terra you once knew is never coming back. And as for the other one
“So then...now what do I do?”
“Continue regaining the rest of your memories. You say that you “remember everything”
“W-What do you-”
“Just keep going”.

--*7th floor:*
This floor is just a rapid-succession of scenes from Kingdom Hearts.

--*6th floor:*
More flash-backs of Kingdom Hearts

Back at the Castle...
“Sora...that was the boy who saved me
“And then he went and stabbed himself with that Keyblade. When he did that, but your heart continued to live. But as usual, you had no memory of your true self. So...now it's time for you to learn what your heart has been up to for the last year and a half.”

--*5th floor:*
Ventus is standing outside of the mansion in Twilight Town

--*4th floor:*
Scenes of Ventus/Roxas interacting with all of the members of Organization 13 (Xion isn't mentioned)

--*3rd floor:*
Ventus/Roxas begins to question who he is

--*2nd floor:*
We see DiZ and Riku putting Ventus/Roxas in the Virtual Twilight Town

Back in Castle Oblivion...
“And there you have it...the life of Ventus. How sad; you've had two different lives
“Alright
“Hahaha
The cloaked man removes his hood
“W-What!? That's impossible! How are you here!?” *backs away slowly*
“Don't think too much about it
“....Why should I listen to you? I don't need to be afraid anymore. If my memories are right

* In BBS, Isa says ""Well, I can tell you are"", and Lea, with a big smile, says ""Yeah."" The two of them then walk towards the castle.
* During the BBS credits
* We know that when a person's Heartless &amp; Nobody are defeated, he was already wearing an Organization Cloak.
* In Chain of Memories, Axel says *""Vexen was caught in the middle. Pitiable, but unavoidable. I could not risk his Program falling into their hands. Of greater concern are the traitors. Not the obvious turncoats, but the ones who will get in his and my way. The Keyblade master is not our enemy.""* So it seems like there's more to it than that.
* In 358/2 Days, Lea.""
* A Secret Report written by Saix: *""I doubt Axel would be among those lost [in Castle Oblivion]
* A Secret Report written by Axel: *""I've lost track of the Keyblade master and the other intruders. I'm the only one left in the castle. Everybody else has been destroyed. My orders were to end the traitors
* A Secret Report from Xigbar: *""Saïx had a hand in what went down at Castle Oblivion - well, but naturally Xemnas knew who the turncoats were right from the get-go.""*
* A Secret Report from Axel: *""I feel like I've been spending more time talking to Roxas and Xion lately than my old friend
* A Secret Report from Axel: *""I ought to be able to share all this with Saïx
* A Secret Report from Saix: *""Our plans never accounted for the possibility of both Xion and Roxas leaving. How did this come to pass? When did Roxas grow strong enough to outmuscle me? What were you really after, it's just and idle fantasy. Everything changed. You, and me.""*

Terra: ""You smell nice.""

And Sora's probably like, I can control 2 Keyblades WITH MY GODDAMN MIND, so I think I've grasped the concept of using a Keyblade a little. so unless your'e gonna get off your old ass and save a world anytime soon, I'll save the worlds with the Gummi Ship shoved up my ass if I really want to!""
