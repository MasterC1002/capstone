Happy new year, you crazy music lovers. :)",evilnight,535, the mods of /r/music asked us to find a couple of obscure artists to promote to the rest of reddit. That request [took on a life of its own](http://redd.it/13d3j0) and has culminated with this submission. We figured new years was the best time to submit

We have several incredible artists to recommend, live performances and interviews with the artists have also been included in these playlists.

* [Shakey Graves](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMynWkfFi4ApstMd4GT8Q5c1T) (blues, Roger Miller, Hank Williams

Links to artist websites and places to purchase the music can be found in the *playlist descriptions.*

Out of all of these artists

---

Of course, and put them into playlists so that everyone could easily surf through the resulting tsunami of music. We also visited some of the other music subreddits and included artists from threads they had already run. Turns out youtube has a playlist limit of 200 items, so the results were broken up into several playlists grouped loosely by the styles of music. Some are more effectively sorted than others due to the time it takes to arrange them using youtube's abysmal editing interface. Apologies to the metal, prog, electro, and post-rock fans for those lists being a bit messy - this was a learning experience and we know better what to do next time around. We might even have it automated. :)

* [Modern](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMynck4QCPMjAOQr79Ot1yRDJ) (post-1980 styles, electro, hiphop etc) 173 artists, 11.47 hours
* [Sounds Vintage](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMynU3rNYtRH-5z-MoZF8xcBv) (pre-1980 styles, rockabilly, folk, bluegrass etc) 167 artists, 11.33 hours
* [Heavy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMyk0BrQGk4moCWQPr6Hfo8ks) (hard rock
* [Electronic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMynnRITRY89z5a1yGkMNkNYr) (instrumentals, 6.31 hours
* [Prog &amp; Post-Rock](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMykWk-xy8IBcqDFqH17_DxnK) (instrumental post-rock and some progressive rock) 50 artists

We have two more end of the year additions that aren't dedicated to obscure artists.

* [Subscriber's Favorites](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMymJSx2v5jTkq9h3s0k7E4un) (top voted tracks of 2012) 62 tracks
* [ListenToThis 2012 Music Awards](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMymc5_PuQShrh76BI-nLPFc-) (because we love to be smartasses) 37 tracks

This is really just the tip of the iceberg

Some folks are converting the youtube playlists into other formats. I'll link them here as they become available. 

Keep in mind that these *will not* be as complete at the ones on youtube. :)

The results of this discussion will become the baseline for our band blacklist

In addition to suggesting bands that should be placed on the initial blacklist, ""I nominate this band for the Blacklist"" and then requiring a certain number (10? 20?) of ""yea"" replies to that nomination. Any band that meets the threshold is added to the blacklist and we never see it again.

By never, or new music.

**The Blacklist page itself will include links to audio on these bands (for example

Keep in mind that this is NOT THE HOTLIST. We will have another list generated by another discussion like this LATER that will be for bands that aren't necessarily well known, prevent new submissions from artists who have been posted more than twice in the past seven days. All of this comes later. For now, concentrate on the blacklist. :)

So

---

Updates from the excellent discussions below...

* We will expand the use of the rare tag

* We will be using a base metric to check for popularity. So far, or Z youtube views on their videos in order to be on the list. The exact values of X/Y/Z are a matter of discussion below, but we will arrive at firm and fair values. At first brush, that appears to be something like meeting two of: 3 million google hits, 2 million last.fm listeners, or three youtube videos that total more than 5 million views.

* The blacklist page will include links to streams of the music from those bands

---

One thing I need to point out to the rest of reddit coming in from /r/all - this is not asking for permission to implement the blacklist. That was asked and answered (and given a yea vote with a massive majority) in two previous rule review threads. You didn't see them? Not our problem, right up to when I put up *this* announcement you are reading now. The list is not even a new idea. We're very late to this particular party.

It is being implemented, focus on being constructive and helping us figure that out. Many of these bands have been removed by the report system for the last two years *and you never even knew about that* unless you read the sub's rules... you know, the ones linked in the sidebar since day five of listentothis' existence. The blacklist will simply be automating that process. If you want it to be less restrictive, then say so, help us figure out where to draw the line, and it will be.

Before you flip out about this

**TL;DR: Popular music will be posted once and for all.**

We'd appreciate feedback. If there are music subs out there that are active (more than 5 posts a month) and we've missed them

So

---

* **[Agora Musica](http://www.reddit.com/user/evilnight/m/agoramusica)** We'll start with the ones that aren't about listening. This multi contains all of the various *musical discussion* subreddits, bands, news, and trading recommendations is the norm. It's a great set. If you've been looking for a community of music lovers to *talk* to, this is what you're after.

* **[Music Makers](http://www.reddit.com/user/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** This second set of discussion subreddits is dedicated to people working in the industry or creating music, teaching, playing in a band or just learning how to play an instrument. This multi represents reddit's cumulative musical knowledge set.

---

Topping the listening list is a trio of multis that contain every active listening sub on reddit. These are here for your own personal discovery. They are broken down by *activity level* not by subscribers! What's most active may surprise you. It certainly surprised us

* **[The Firehose](http://www.reddit.com/user/evilnight/m/thefirehose) ([Play](http://radd.it/user/evilnight/m/thefirehose?only=music))** View this one by new and refresh

* **[The Fountain](http://www.reddit.com/user/evilnight/m/thefountain) ([Play](http://radd.it/user/evilnight/m/thefountain?only=music))** The next 100 by activity level. These move at a leisurely pace, dedicated to niche genres and off the wall concepts.

* **[The Drip](http://www.reddit.com/user/evilnight/m/thedrip) ([Play](http://radd.it/user/evilnight/m/thedrip?only=music))** These are the lowest, or a lack of readership. Hopefully getting some of these overlooked gems a bit of exposure will get them moving again. In the aggregate they still produce enough content to justify looking at this one at least once a day.

The multis below have a heavy overlap with this trio

---

We have a few multis dedicated to broad topics.

* **[TrueMusic](http://www.reddit.com/user/evilnight/m/truemusic) ([Play](http://radd.it/user/evilnight/m/truemusic?only=music))** This is our crown jewel. All of the most unique, please recommend that it be included.

* **[Redditunes](http://www.reddit.com/user/evilnight/m/redditunes) ([Play](http://radd.it/user/evilnight/m/redditunes?only=music))** One hundred percent redditor-created content

* **[Vintage](http://www.reddit.com/user/evilnight/m/vintage) ([Play](http://radd.it/user/evilnight/m/vintage?only=music))** My own little guilty pleasure. All of these subreddits are dedicated, indie, and other modern forms of music have on reddit, it seemed like a good idea to round up the classics, new and old, into their own set.

---

The most useful way to break these down is by genre. These multis are rather broad. We felt this was best so that people could see all a genre has to offer and then narrow their copies down to suit their tastes on their own. Some are small, *please* reply here and let us know! I am certain there are a few unintentional omissions.

All of these will soon be replacing the traditional /r/Listentothis sidebar subreddit links. You will always be able to find the most up to date versions here. Thanks to the multis we finally can include everyone! These may change slightly over the next couple of days as we update them based on your suggestions. Any new music listening communities on reddit should feel free to [PM the mods of /r/Listentothis](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flistentothis) at any time. We will add them to the appropriate multis. 

We may also add a few new multis to this list over the course of the day.

We would greatly appreciate it if everyone would leave a comment on each artist that they feel deserves the reddit bump. It'll help us narrow the list with something more meaningful than simple upvotes.

Edit: You guys are amazing. This thread is on *fire* with excellent submissions. 

[Playlists are taking shape at this link.](http://www.youtube.com/user/ListenToThisOfficial/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=1) They aren't in any sort of order at this point and change frequently as I shuffle videos around in a feeble attempt to mix them. Don't go sharing this around until it's actually finished. :) I got every artist mentioned in this thread

The total haul here for the playlists was *four hundred and forty five under-appreciated artists.* Truly epic work

I still have to do two things - first, create separate playlists focusing on each artist we're picking out as winners. It'll be more than five... perhaps as many as twenty, and with an effort to diversify genres in the results. If you see a playlist titled 'artist spotlight' appear you'll know that artist is going on the list.

We'd like your opinion on the wisdom or foolishness of this idea and how best to implement it if we go forward.,evilnight,423,74,199,"Reddit has a little known feature... you can prefix reddit.com with any two alphabetic characters and it will still work. You can have http://aa.reddit.com/r/listentothis and http://ab.reddit.com/r/listentothis et cetera. That's a total of 676 combinations. Each of these can have its own unique CSS stylesheet. This has been used quite a bit in other subreddits to load different themes

/u/multi-mod mentioned he could use this to create different *editions* of listentothis in combination with clever use of flair. After we made him explain what this means and how it works

Imagine something like this...

* http://hv.reddit.com/r/listentothis - The 'Heavy' Edition. Only submissions containing genre tags like metal, hardcore, punk, etc are visible. The sub looks similar, but styled more in line with heavy music and darker colors.

* http://in.reddit.com/r/listentothis - The 'Indie' Edition. Anything tagged with indie, etc.

* http://em.reddit.com/r/listentothis - The 'Electronic' edition. Only electronic music submissions are visible.

* http://os.reddit.com/r/listentothis - The 'Obscure' edition. Only tracks with fewer than 100k last.fm listeners. This gets a bit tricky but it should still be doable. ~~(It's a flair-multiplication problem).~~ We could even run a mainstream edition and *relax* the popularity rules. 

~~By flair multiplication I mean this... if we have a heavy edition, we need flair for heavy, heavy-curated, heavy-obscure-curated, heavy-obscure. Getting all of these tags to work and look good is a major time consuming pain in the ass, so we need to be careful how we set this up.~~

You get the idea. The main /r/Listentothis would of course remain unaffected and still contain all submissions. Bots can *very easily* manage the flair tagging needed to make this happen - as long as our submitters continue to use genre tags it'll work no problem.

Why would we want to do this? 

* People here for just one group of sounds/styles will be more easily able to find them
* This may reduce the love/hate genre problem that has driven metal into /r/headbangtothis and most hip-hop out of listentothis. Love/hate genres don't do well here. Too much downvoting even though it is against the rules.
* Our submission rate is now hovering just over 200 tracks a day. On January 1 it was at 120. Care to guess what it will be in 2014? 2015? It's getting beyond our ability to control. Splitting it up into subgroups helps keep people focused on what they like and reduces the noise from things they aren't interested in. It slows things down a bit even though the total submission count continues to rise.
* We can put genre champions in charge of each of these editions. These are special mods that are meant to represent the interests of that particular sub-group and be knowledgeable about that particular sphere of music.

If we had thought of this two years ago... we might have had a lot fewer splinter subreddits

There would be a series of tabs up at the top in the header

One side note: These editions *would not function* unless you have subreddit styles enabled. They rely on the CSS changes for their functionality. I don't think this would work out well on any of the mobile reddit apps

Yes

As far as I know

Obviously

---

So, and what groups of music lovers are most comfortable being neighbors with each other in the various editions? What kind of editions would you like to see?

This is very much in the brainstorming phase right now

---

**Ok, then allow users to exclude 4, would require more than a thousand links. We can't have more than about 600 within reddit's framework nor are we able to put in that much work on something that amounts to a gross CSS hack. We might be able to do a couple of exclusion editions, but only a couple. We can tell you how to roll your own with the search, though. There will be a wiki page for that in the future.~~

Haha

* [No POP
* [Rock edition](http://zb.reddit.com/r/listentothis/search?q=rock&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)
* 2013 edition implemented via /r/listentonew 
* [Punk edition](http://zz.reddit.com/r/listentothis/search?q=punk&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)

Note: Curated content system is being removed and reimplemented as something an order of magnitude better than the previous incarnation. It will be its own edition at /r/listentocurated

The submission in the original YSK thread was a bit misleading. If you want to see what listentothis is all about, it's quite a timesink. There's another one of these coming along tentatively next weekend. We eventually want to do these every three months, but we need a larger team of music lovers to handle that kind of workload.

I *strongly* suggest you check out the subreddits linked in [our sidebar.](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/about/sidebar) You'll find that whatever your musical taste, dedicated to that kind of music.

If you check out the 'listening tools' section of the sidebar you will find free mobile apps and various websites that can turn the content of any musical subreddit into an ongoing playlist for easy listening. radd.it is the best of these and was created by one of our moderators.

You may notice we have a ['curated' tab](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/search?q=flair%3A%22curated%22&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on) up top (unless you have styles disabled) which is [an ongoing project](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/wiki/curators) here to shine a spotlight on the best submissions. We have 200 redditors with curator access

Listentothis encourages *all* styles of music, and pop tracks. Don't downvote the genres you dislike, just move on or click hide. Try out some of these other genres from time to time and you may surprise yourself with what you like.

We do get a lot of *bad* music submitted here. Part of what listentothis does is wade through all of that and try to find the gems for you so that you don't have to put in the time it takes to listen to 120 submissions a day. The best gems our mods and curators can find end up on the curated tab and in these large roundup threads like the best of 2012 linked above.

All submissions should be artists whose first releases happened in 2011. It's ok if they had a few tracks or an EP prior to 2011

I suspect many of the artists you will wish to submit have tracks up on [bandcamp,](http://www.reverbnation.com/) and [grooveshark,](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=grooveshark&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CC8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgrooveshark.com%2F&amp;ei=A_DcTtzuBem2sQL87ZXwDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFwPgcAlOqhAZcXe49L7my_KUv2bg&amp;cad=rja) if you are looking for links to share.

i just genuinely like the fact that i have somewhere to come and have people give me their thoughts about what ive been working on. sometimes at 3am, its hard to think of a reason to try one more take, one more song, one more minute. but knowing that there is atleast  one person out there who will give it a listen and give me their thoughts makes a difference. it seems small. but its one hell of a difference. 


just felt like sharing. thanks again.

Q. How is this any different than [/r/listentothis](/r/listentothis)?

A. Really, and are interested in hearing some artists that they'd probably not hear otherwise. I love [/r/listentothis](/r/listentothis), but I often see the posts that are fitting for [/r/under10k](/r/under10k) get no comments or upvotes here. This new subreddit is a place for those posts, and those posts only.

I'd be happy to answer any other questions you all may have.

----------

The second subreddit is [/r/recordstore](/r/recordstore). If you've ever wanted to work in a record store, or what artists you'd like if you enjoyed X artist, and all the many other questions that you may have. I'm trying to figure out how to setup flair, and as soon as I do I am going to use flair to designate experts in particular genres. Do you know a lot about post-punk? Come show that knowledge off and you'll get flair letting people know you work in the post-punk section.",,False,self,False,t3_n67qu

- One song per comment. 
- I will only take parent comments (so if you suggest a song as a reply to another song
- After this post is 48 hours old I will compile a list of the top voted songs and give you Spotify
- Songs must be from at least December 1
- Let's focus on tracks that are somewhat forgotten or haven't had 'their break' (see: sidebar). Use some discretion here (or the search bar). For reference: let's assume everyone has well and truly heard Daft Punk.

Yabish?

I'll get us going: [√ìlafur Arnalds ft. Arn√≥r Dan - Old Skin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXkc2GLPl6I)

In the past couple of years I've listened to around 2000 different albums. I found a lot of great and relatively unknown stuff. I've decided to post a daily song to Reddit ([r/themvoices](http://www.reddit.com/r/themvoices)).

After about 150 such posts

I thought that the greater Reddit community might be interested in them

The playlists: (each has around 25-30 songs).

The [last thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/j3bm8/some_tips_to_get_your_submissions_through/) has expired and no longer accepts new comments. This is the new thread.

**If you want the TL;DR version

---

**Statistics**

**We're gaining ~180 subscribers a day** (up from 100 six months ago) and we've added 20, around 10 are blocked for being too popular or too frequently posted. The remaining 40 are blocked because they are missing the required artist, title, and genre tags. 

Generally, morning is the best time to submit.**

Out of the 125 submissions approved, or nostalgia posts of bands that were popular years ago. Then there are ten that are fairly well known to everyone, typically the most popular artists on internet sites during the last month, or something that was on television or in the movies recently.

Even after two years

That's an average day in the life of listentothis.

**Reddiquette**

**Listentothis is *heavily* moderated** - one of the most heavily moderated communities on reddit, broken up into three groups.

**For our listeners...**

* **We *are biased against* music that is already popular by definition here. If you've already heard the track, not relive past favorites.

* **We depend on the community for our definition of popularity.** **If you see a track that, heard on radio frequently, got a band into the hall of fame, top40, see the artist here five times in a week, etc) then **click on ""report""** under the submission title. The mods review the report list frequently. Note: a report doesn't guarantee removal. It just guarantees a mod will look at it and make a decision. The more people who report, the more even-handed the moderation becomes

* **We make three exceptions to the popularity rule.** **New** music by popular bands (by anyone, but are, as their name implies, rare.

* **We prefer to err on the too-permissive side of things.** Don't flip out if the occasional popular track or two are at the top of the hot page. Flip out when they *dominate* the hot page. Then report. 

* **Viewing by [new](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/new/) is a better way to enjoy listentothis if you are interested in the obscure music. The majority of the freshest, and you're missing out.**

**For our submitters...**

* **Submissions are *required* to contain three things:** The name of the **artist, no excuses, no exceptions.

* **The submission title format of: 'artistName - trackName [genre tags] comments' is now *strictly* enforced by the [automoderator bot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/q50ba/the_automoderator_bot_is_now_active_in_this/)** Submissions that don't match will be auto-removed

* **Avoid using *indie* or *alternative* or tags that do not describe the *sound* of the band.**  We prefer tags like folk, upbeat, ambient, shoegaze, classical, jazz, bluegrass, acoustic, chiptune

* **If it's your own music or your friend's band

* **If it is *new* or *rare* or *live* or *nsfw* please tag it as such.** These tags help us make sure that those tracks get special consideration during moderation. If you submit a new release from a popular artist without tagging it as new, and love a good video.

* **Remixes and covers are fine, please provide more genre information than just [remix] or [cover] or [mashup]. Try for [acoustic cover] or [electro mashup.]

* Your submission titles are not limited to just those bits of information - feel free to say anything else you like

* **Please check the search box on the right to see if the band or track you are posting has been posted recently. If it's been over a month, or have hundreds of upvotes, post something else or at least a different track by that band. When in doubt, a good live performance is always a safe bet. **If you get pages of results for a band, we aren't interested in them unless it's *new* or *live* material.**

* **Do *not* flood us with multiple tracks from the same band all at once.** If you want to share multiple tracks

* **Submitting entire albums as a *single* submission is fine

* **Submitting [playlists](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/search?q=playlist&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on) or your own mixtape compilations is fine** as well

* *Other* content is allowed provided it pertains to music in some way - such as documentaries on genres or bands

* **Our sidebar over there ==&gt; contains links to many of reddit's best musical communities. Take the time to pay some of them a visit.** Chances are if you have a specific genre you love

**For promoters...**

* There's been a rise in bands (and agents) spamming submissions and comments (which we actively block if it becomes abusive). **Artists are welcome to submit their own tracks as long as they follow the aforementioned rules. Other interests, guaranteeing they get noticed.

The floor is open for discussion about the rules, and it'll be linked in the sidebar.

Enjoy the music. :)

We have a new job for our users - particularly

If you're getting sick of seeing a particular band over and over, does not belong here (too popular, bad formatting, blogspam, etc) click on the report link under the post.  The more people we have registering these reports, the easier it is for the moderators to manage the content and keep the front page clear for new musical discoveries. 

These reports act like a poll and help us to tell when listentothis is tired of seeing specific bands. We do not want to get into a position where we have to rely solely on moderators to determine what content stays or goes. Users who are worried they will be missing out on bands we consider to be too popular only need to click the [top](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/top/) link. The original posts and discussions are still there. 

There are three exceptions we'd like you to make for this popularity rule...

* Brand new music by popular bands
* Exceptional live clips of popular bands
* New remixes or good covers of popular band's music

* **Post a reply to this thread that is a [genre]** you are interested in seeing on the charts. Vote these [genre] replies up so they float to the top of the thread. Please stick to *broad* genres for now, metal, hip-hop, rock, etc.
* **Post songs you think should be on the charts as replies to the [genre] threads.** So, post all of your hip-hop recommendations under that, one video/music link per post.
* **Vote UP the video/music links under each genre thread if you want that track to chart.** Feel free to upvote as many of them as you like. Don't bother downvoting

If you haven't listened to a track

There are no restrictions to what you can submit for consideration on the charts - not even the usual restrictions against popular bands. Don't let the popularity of a track in listentothis or other music reddits influence your pick - these charts are for people who don't care to spend all day slogging through the tsunami of music flowing through reddit.

There are no restrictions on [genre] - you can just as easily start a thread for [wtf] or [bestof2010] or [christmas] as anything else. The genres that are the most upvoted and have a large overall response will be the ones that make the chart.

**WTF is this doing here clogging up my audiostream?**

There's been some chatter lately about putting together a tl;dr-style best of the month music chart in the vein of billboard top40 (with less suck of course)

We will likely go with something like 10 per popular genre, and how many people choose to participate. We're also linking this thread in the sidebar so it won't get lost. Voting will be open for at least a week, perhaps longer. Maybe we should leave it open for the entire month? You tell us.

We're thinking that if a given artist wins a spot on the chart on one month

If this goes well we'll probably be doing this once a month starting during the first week of each month. After voting closes

---

**My picks are better than this feeble hipster hivemind.**

There will undoubtedly be people who think we are full of shit and that they can do a better job than the hivemind. Some of them are probably right. That's good news becase we have a job for them too. While we're compiling our community charts, and post them as replies to ours. We'll see how it goes and decide if we need to change the format/rules from there.

This is a work-in-progress
