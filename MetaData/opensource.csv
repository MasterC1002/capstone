You've probably read about the [resynthesizer](http://www.logarithmic.net/pfh/resynthesizer)

I now have proof that resynthesizer is witchcraft:

* [This is the image I started with.](http://i.imgur.com/tHzBg.jpg) There's a large stupid logo that I wanted to remove.

* I selected by colour with various thresholds

* But now:  
I simply went *Filters -- Map -- Resynthesize* [and had this](http://i.imgur.com/FprYw.png).  
That's what it came up with on its own, IMHO, that hand and leg look entirely believable as is. 

Take

PS:

There actually are even more filters by the same author:

""Stolen"" app: http://itunes.apple.com/app/stampus/id431052564?mt=8

I find this quite funny because it's an app for a student radio and is mainly targeted for students at the campus here in the small city of Helsingborg (southern Sweden). So I don't think the thief will sell that much :P 
Looking at the thief's website (very ugly) makes me think he/she steals everything he shows on there. 

I'm very new to open sourcing stuff and thought GPL v.3 sounded good. Though I haven't really learned everything about the license my impression was that you couldn't just take the code
I realize there's always a risk open sourcing stuff and putting the code out there

I'm not really sure what to do. I'm not that angry as Stampus FM isn't that big of a project for me

So I'm just looking for some advice :)
I have his/hers/their e-mail address and thinking my first action will be to try that one (though will be very surprised if I get an answer). Then

I will take this as a lesson (especially if my impression of GPL was wrong).

Thanks reddit!
Love / sawadee

Edit: There are some graphical changes to the app

Edit 2: Apparently my understanding of GPL was a little bit wrong

Edit 3: directhex's comment was very enlighting and makes me rethink my whole open source approach. I really need to study this before I open source iOS apps in the future.

Edit 4: Whoa

Your source code unlocked an elemental force of entropy reduction when it was released. A gem that can sustain other intrepid creators until they too release new source code and decrease the entropy of the universe in their turn.

You have made an indelible contribution to the beauty of the universe that will forever be your legacy.

Want a logo?,Rainfly_X,79,17,45,"After making logos for [Chromitude](https://github.com/Blackglasses/Chromitude) ([logo](http://orchard.crabdance.com/i/Chromitude.svg)) and [Piglet](https://github.com/Dervall/Piglet) ([logo](http://orchard.crabdance.com/i/piglet.svg))

**EDIT**: I managed to forget to include [my own project](https://github.com/campadrenalin/ConcurrenTree) ([logo](http://orchard.crabdance.com/i/OrchardLogo.svg)) in this list. I feel a bit silly now

**EDIT 2**: Wow, and such a positive response. It's gonna be a challenge to do all of these - some projects have ""obvious"" logos (like Piglet), but others, it feels like I'm playing pictionary and got tasked with drawing ""love"" or ""financial instability."" So those of you whose projects don't lend to any obvious logo, I'm going to have to consult with to understand your project better, until some idea ""clicks"" with me.

Also, or my real name. But if you want my real name I prefer you PM me about it, since I don't necessarily want people making a connection between ""reddit me"" and ""potential employee"" me.

A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace

by John Perry Barlow &lt;barlow@eff.org&gt;

Governments of the Industrial World, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.

We have no elected government

Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us

You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could be obtained by any of your impositions.

You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't exist. Where there are real conflicts, not yours. Our world is different.

Cyberspace consists of transactions, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.

We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, or station of birth.

We are creating a world where anyone, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.

Your legal concepts of property, movement, and context do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no matter here.

Our identities have no bodies, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge . Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis. But we cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.

In the United States, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These dreams must now be born anew in us.

You are terrified of your own children, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.

In China, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States, you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media.

Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish.

These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the authorities of distant

We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.

Please help me write it,FOSSthrowaway,82,32,34,"I recently learned that, but I want to start with someone a little closer to me in the school hierarchy. I want to know what people here think and if they think I could do something differently. Here is what I have written so far:

&gt;Dear [dean] and [dean's assistant]
&gt;
&gt;I am writing to express my disapproval regarding the use of the mandatory ALEKS test for placement within mathematics courses and within the CNS. [college of natural sciences]
&gt;
&gt;   As you may know, the University of Texas at Austin should not force its students to use any unfree (*non-libre*) software, and should especially not force students to use non-free (*non-gratis*) software. It is unfair and unjust that students are forced to pay money to use private software to attend a public institution. At the very least, whatever software students are forced to use should be available to them at zero cost. 
&gt;
&gt;   There are many reasons that asking students to use non-gratis (paid) software is wrong. The first of which is that the use of such software benefits a private corporation instead of the public university. Not only are the students being harmed by the compulsory purchase of paid software
&gt;
&gt;   It is especially unfair that students must pay to use the ALEKS software because using the ALEKS software is absolutely mandatory. If using ALEKS is truly necessary for the smooth operation of UT Austin, it's misleading, and for those students who are struggling to afford the university already, it's hurtful. 
&gt;
&gt;   Finally, you are putting private interests before public interests. As a governmental entity, this is completely unacceptable. Governmental entities should strive towards openness, transparency, and fairness to people of all economic means. Requiring the use of unfree software is detrimental towards this end.
&gt;
&gt;   I would like to request that the University of Texas at Austin, the Taxpayers, and the Students) switch to administering such tests using free software.
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely
&gt;[me]
&gt;

UT seems to be pretty good about FOSS in some regards. All of the computer lab computers (that I've seen) boot Ubuntu by default and Windows because Microsoft paid for all the licenses. I just wish that they didn't force every single student to pay for closed software *just to get in* to the university.",self,t5_2qh4n,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1fmkzw/im_writing_a_letter_to_the_dean_of_my_college/

1365426194.0,1bwxu4,I just had a crazy idea: I want to create an Open Source Workout.,DroidLogician,86,32,21,"Downvote me if you want

I was sitting on the couch watching an infomercial for one of those dime-a-dozen fitness systems created by a &lt;fitness expert/doctor/kinesiologist/special forces veteran/etc&gt; and I had a thought:

Who knows if this crap really works? And who wants to actually pay for it?

It's the same with a gym membership

Like a lot of people

So here's my crazy idea: I want to create an open source workout. Not some expensive system created by some guy you've never heard of who's supposed to be an expert. It would be an ongoing, figuring out what works and what doesn't. Maybe occasionally assisted by some actual experts.

It will be just like a regular project on GitHub. Maybe even structured like an object-oriented application.

There can be ""packages"" for different areas, endurance, diet, etc. You could have ""interfaces"" or ""protocols"" (depending on the terminology of your best known OO language) for standard archetype workouts or routines (or recipes, in the case of diets), and then ""implementations"" that give detailed instructions on how to perform the workouts, the time it takes, etc. Workouts that require certain equipment can specify for that.

GitHub would be a great platform to host it on. Want to contribute a workout? Fork the project

It would be totally free and open source. No DVD sets

What do you guys think? Am I really crazy? Is it a stupid idea or could it actually be something?

As I am quite far away from my loved ones

Just after I got linphone account and set everything up, there are many other alternatives let's try some other big one for the Windows - Ekiga. After another half an hour trying to figure out which settings are uselessly rebranded, we manage to set it up, and finally I hear ringing sound. *""Now I can relax and enjoy the conversation""*, as I have thought.

After around 30 seconds of bad quality sound and 10 frames of picture later, let's call again,""* I have thought, the next dozens of times, until it get very hard on my nerves.

One Linphone to Ekiga conversation time (read: ~30 seonds) later

O.K., I have Ekiga, managed to set it up, after getting Ekiga account, due to ""Authentication failure""'s with linphone account, I am very excited to get the call again. This time the picture freezes at the first frame it shows, it would be quite hard to describe the sound ""quality"" because it was beyond any description and everything froze just after a minute of talking [...]. many tries later and totally one day spent just dicking around with software, forums
