Your personality **type** is not your personality. An MBTI type is like an empty bowl if you wish and your *personality* is the content of that bowl. Your experiences, everything that defines you as a person. The bowl shapes the content, but the content is by far more important than the bowl.

I've always felt extremely different from my friends/family/peers

I am utilizing my artistic nature by writing a book series. It's taken a long time and dedication to get the ball rolling... 7 years just building up lore

I am a chameleon; capable of becoming anything anyone needs or wants me to be in order to gain a deeper insight into their souls but more often than not I already know what people are thinking or going to say before they speak -- something that I find incredibly frustrating most of the time.

My ability to sum up and understand people as well as I do has become almost a heavy burden

I originally found out I was an INFJ after taking a personality test in my first year of college (abnormal psychology course) and my professor was thrilled because I was the only other INFJ she'd met (she even made me take 2 different tests after the first.) She was someone I connected with. It's been a few years and I was reading a magazine that mentioned personality types so I decided to retake the test and sure enough

This might sound dumb or hokey, and had a hard time communicating my deep thoughts and feelings with others. This has turned me into sort of a jaded person, and also feel scared very often that I will never find people who truly understand me or connect with me. This past year has been especially hard - I've lost my grandfather (who I was very close to), struggled spiritually, broken up with my first and only boyfriend (who I still love), lost my childhood home, been through a lot of family issues, and it makes me sad to feel so intensely about so much and have no sort of outlet for it and nothing good to hope for. I have no friends who understand what I've gone through

This subreddit gives me hope, and that the possibility of having friends who truly ""get"" me is really just that: a possibility, and not just some far-away dream. It's good to know that despite living in such an extroverted world that feels full of shallow and uncaring people, the truth is that other people who think like me are hiding out there somewhere, and even if it takes me a while to find them, they do truly exist and it's possible for me to build new (better?) relationships someday.

That said, and I'm happy to have been reminded that I am not alone in this world.  :')

We've got to interact with our fellow man most of the time but so much of that is in a painfully shallow way.  We can't tell them about our real thoughts or they might be afraid of us or worse

There's nothing worse than someone staring at you blankly after you've just tried to communicate a multi-layered emotional concept which has hounded you for days.  Our intensity can be frightening so we hide it behind a mask of neutrality.  

We might live interesting lives (often despite our best efforts) because we accept people immediately so long as they don't set off our alarms.  We accept but do not trust.  Trust can take years except between other INFJ's.  Even then

Words are painfully inadequate.  Language fails us.  We dumb down every concept for those who don't intuit and hide the truth in every sentence.  We obscure what we see in each other and in the world around us under layers of carefully constructed masks.  

Underneath all of that and within the inner world there are infinite planes.  Imagination in an INFJ is a living force.  Our creative capacity borders on divinity.  

Unfortunately that leaves us in a tough spot where telling other people what's going on in our head-meats is concerned.  Thankfully we can tell each other.  I've noticed other INFJ's tend to...simply understand.  I don't know how or why.  It may have something to do with the scaling nature of language.  We generate a small web of words and it suggests a much larger one.

Third, however, are born with an internal value system that responds to your situation. It is why you can easily break laws and have no guilt, but suffer extreme guilt when you betray your value system. However, be wary of your romantic side. Your idealism can make you stray from reality and this can lead you to make decisions that are not rational. Understand this is not a perfect world and you will not change that.


Fourth, kind, and honest are defeated. This will cause you to go war, when most of the time your strong negotiating skills bring peace. Learn to control this side. Use your spiritual side to balance the rage and know that these suffering people are just fulfilling their karma. But still help them. You will find failure and no satisfaction in a corporate career. Status means little to you, it is your value system you need. Your keen perception tells you that status stems from the insecurity people have about themselves and how they need to prove themselves to others. As such, you rid yourself of this foolish desire for status and because you answer to no one but your value system. You want the experience, the truth


Fifth, but someone you can trust. Someone who also has the ability to make money. This is important to you although you may not know it yet. You are attracted to this not for materialistic concerns but because it shows they can stand on their own two feet and are strong people. In addition, they will be able to counter your strong personality and bring harmony, which is what brings you pleasure. You will back down to them in an admiringly way. For men, you are likely to be impressed by a female executive, a college professor, someone that helps the down trodden in her spare time. One who can engage in deep conversation because your knowledge on issues is vast.
Few people understand the power of your mind, and loyalty. Women will be impressed by your emotionality when they get through to you. They will enjoy how you avoid machismo for deeper conversation and they will be delighted to experience the full range of emotions you can provide. Likely, you will talk to your significant other about the beauty of Paris as the men in the next room rally behind the local football game. They will be stunned at your sincerity and honesty. And it takes time for them to get inside you. When they do, and you let them in, these people are guarded for life. They will have access to some of the deepest and most stimulating conversations of their lives, climaxing in love-making. The void of their own insecurity will be filled with you and your ability to understand them. And make sure to let them in. Don’t block for too long, this will drive them away. To do this say what you are thinking. You have the ability to disappear in thought. Bring that thought o the front and speak it.

It's hard to pin down exactly. I've taken the tests, and I realize that as an INTJ I'm also egotistical and walled-off in communication. I don't like most of the other INTJ's that I meet, but I have loved every INFJ that I've ever met. 

INFJ's seem to me to be very thoughtful and deep people, whereas INTJ's can only solve rational problems and then go on to create a slew of emotional dilemmas. They may not care, but not everyone is an INTJ and the problems still exist. INFJ's are aided in intuition, they can solve rational problems in addition to emotional ones. 

The first girl I ever met that was INFJ, capable of succeeding in anything she set her mind to, but where she really shined was art history and literature. She had a natural sense for fostering a comfortable environment of kindness and good nature. If anyone set out to offend her, she just smiled and withdrew, never communicating with them again and not furthering the hostility. While she was a deeply empathetic person, she never turned away from things or people that she found unsettling and cruel. She just took an effort to understand why that was, and attempted to fix anything that she saw. Horrible assholes were not just evil people to be avoided to her. They were individuals

Every INFJ I've ever met seemed to possess the analytical skills of a scientist with the deep empathy and emotional understanding of a poet. Some of this may be a huge generalization; I am aware that not all personalities are exactly the same

Anyway, I aim to stay in their lives for as long as possible. Most people are too fickle and shallow for me to want to get close to, but the stereotypical INFJ personality brings out a sentimental side in me that hardly anyone ever sees.

1367191681.0,1dauop,3 years ago...,tekprodfx16,45,4,21,"I don't know why I'm writing this. I don't know why I'm not using a throwaway. I could get into really really solid details about the entire thing (it would take a really long time though

3 years ago, someone who I had spent 3 years idealizing and visualizing this sweet married future with someone who I thought was so caring and most importantly someone who got me, cared for me, was patient with me and dearly loved me back, broke up with me 10 days before our wedding, and the day after we bought our wedding rings together. 2.5 years later I found out she was most likely cheating on me with the person she would ultimately marry less than a year after they broke up. Last Dec someone who would know said they had their first child. My whole life I've idealized humans, how we should act, it really hurts when I see people in pain, clean the fucking car"" I've always idealized love. I could never do casual relationships even though sometimes my sexual energy makes me want to grab certain prospects and fuck the living shit out of them like a rabid mad dog who just escaped the loony bin. I value love and the type of care, harsh

I'm really sorry for this sudden emesis of words. Someone close to me has really hurt me today. I'm 29 right now, I could not believe how the person whose tears I wiped away so many times, the person I tried so hard to be the best guy for, spent 3 years changing my life for so the family I wanted to have so quickly with her, so I could just wake up next to that beautiful face and kind person and just hug the shit out of and say to hell with work today I'm sleeping in, I could not believe that person just left me high and dry like that. I always just wanted to find one awesome person, marry her, sweet, we will fight to the fucking death having your back. But why the fuck is it SO HARD to find someone to be with who is EXACTLY like that. Do people not get or forget how to be a loyal partner anymore and good person? I can't even begin to describe the depths of my efforts for this person. One year at college it was her birthday but the end of the semester so I had no money. I was stressing about finals but I was stressing out about the fact that I couldn't do anything for her on her special day, at least she'll still have me watching out for her. I in a moment of brilliant resourcefulness

I'm sorry if this goes in 30, but especially not from a particular person whom I made myself so vulnerable to because I CARED so much for, not from a person who could so thoroughly eviscerate my heart. I've wanted to make a throwaway and just tell the whole story on reddit so many times, but always told myself it's not neccessary because I was over it or it was too painful to even think about. I guess the reason I'm doing it here is because spending the little time I have on this subreddit, I can truly see how uncannily similar to each other we all are. There's no denying it. So my reasoning for this post was maybe to vent a little, but also gauge whether anyone here could truly understand the depths of my heartbreak, let down, how I was able to literally sleep in my car for a month after it happened and dropped everything important in my life, but one who now feels so pessimistic about love, but I don't know if I could ever love someone truly as much and am even more fearful that I will never find someone who could match the capacity of love


Btw, to get over the heartbreak and see if I could love like that again. It didn't, and I couldn't. Not with these people at least. My ex was truly special to me. I loved everything about her. It just shocked me to find out what kind of person she turned out to be. It was a true, true mind fuck. After all this time, that's the best way to describe it all. I thought was had such a real connection, I was convinced. I guess I was too stupid, or naive. Maybe both. 



**Edit** - Thank you all so much for the kind words. I think what compelled me here to give you all a small snippet of the story was the fact that obviously a lot of us think and care about other people in many of the same ways. People surrounding me could never understand how I could love her so much or could understand how loyal and committed to her I was, but just go with it. I'm pretty confident I would have always loved her as much, so she had nothing to worry about in terms of me changing my love for her because she is all not all that great. I had fought for this girl after countless hours of analyzing whether or not it was worth it for me, and after I determined it was, I just fought for her. That's it. What bothers me most though is that she had always felt I didn't fight enough, and was especially upset sometimes about how I didn't stand up to my parents for her. I was kicked out of my house a few times during our relationship because I was so upset my parents made her feel so uncomfortable, that it was killing my relationship. In the end I realized it was her, congratulations. I hope you two have a very happy life together"" was actually the person that ended up marrying her. So yeah, enroll back into medical classes and slowly but surely enroll in a good PA program and finish that. That's what my ultimate goal was when we were together. I want to finish it because it will allow me to have the family I always wanted, I could at least finish

**Edit 2** - I am going to reply to each one of you beautiful people. It's hard to consecutively though.

1372982218.0,1hnvu1,I used to think that I'm a little bit crazy (and that I was the only one)...,skyfly3r,46,8,20,"...until I just learned about different personality types

My entire life I felt... weird... and out of place... I found it very difficult to connect with people around me. My ideas and my thought process were always more complex and deep than those of my peers. The few friends that I've had in my life were always either 3-5 years younger than me or 10-50 years older than me. No matter who they were

By the time I got to college, I had no problem of getting up in front of a hundred people and giving a speech on the subject of interest, and people would actually listen. I recognized people's emotions and I could easily see sadness and pain around me. I also felt an inner desire to do something about people's suffering. The way I processed situations around me was also fundamentally different from others' processes. I always saw something ""bigger"" and ""deeper"" in every situation. I relentlessly looked for ""hidden meaning"" in just about everything. I never talked to anyone about me and who I was inside. I fully realized that I had never met anyone else like me before. I also knew that if I were ever to say that to anyone else, I'd sound like the most egoistical, full-of-herself, cliched person. I never wanted that. So I kept it all to myself. 

There were other self-realizations, and self-guided by strong sense of empathy towards others. **And I felt so alone because of that.** I felt like no one else around me was fighting the fight I was fighting. No one else saw what I saw. All of that pain. And suffering. Nobody else even *cared* about the depth of life and connections that we can have as humans. I've come to terms with who I was. But it was so damn lonely here in my head.

When I did that test, so to speak. 

So if you're like me, in your shelter, you seem to be alone. But you are not alone. You are not alone.

That's what I realized upon taking that test and coming to this subreddit. There are others who can understand me and the complexity in my head.

I'm a very lucky person. I was gifted great genes that have made me a pretty attractive guy.
I have countless opportunities to pursue women and if I desired could probably have a lot of sex. All my friends think I get laid all the time and are shocked when I tell them I choose not to.

 I'm not like my friends, have sex with her and then say goodbye forever. I can't help but feel guilty, feeling that I used her, so I don't. I have to get to know her, otherwise it's empty for me, meaningless and hollow. 

I can charm and flirt with the best but if you slip me your number I probably won't call. Intimacy is something that I crave but becomes desecrated if I don't know her inside and out.

I guess what I'm saying is

Do you have to truly be connected to someone to feel anything?

are all you out there picking up partners left and right? Or do you go for long relationship to relationship?

I think I'm INFJ but I don't always act like it. When I'm around large groups of people (that I know, shock and absurdist stuff with a splash of self-deprication. Sometimes, I'm almost an attention whore. Then, when I get home I feel exhausted. People sometimes ask me if when I'm home do I just come up with that ""stuff"" in a joking manner and I tell them yeah, I'm actually super boring. I'll say it like a joke too but it's kinda true. I've always enjoyed acting silly and making people laugh and, for someone who isn't planning on going into comedy, I put alot of work into it... Also, conversations about sports and the weather, or how Kubrick revolutionized filmmaking, I can't tell if this is really me or not


Then there's the other persona I take on. My dad and I are really different. We have different views on philosophy, do-nothing person. We hardly speak because of the way he reacts when I tell him things. One time, we were discussing drugs and I told him I don't think any drugs should be illegal and he got really mad at me. It turned into this big argument, not because I was doing drugs but because I had an opinion. I can;t joke around with him. We have very conflicting views.I have no idea what to do there. I'm not the extroverted jokester but I'm not myself either...although maybe the jokester person is who I am. My dad is hardly aware I have a sense of humor. That dates all the way back to late elementary school and early midle school, when I made a joke about a possessed cat or lighting something on fire. Looking back on it, I think he was more concerned about the fact I told it in school and he didn't want me to get in trouble but he was still appalled at the comment. He doesn't get absurdist jokes or self deprecation either. I'm not very comfortable with the way we rarely communicate. We spend time together but conversations aren't to common, meaningful ones even rarer. The person that I act like for my father is who that entire side of the family thinks I am...and I don't like that but I don't know how to, change it.

I also seek out a lot of new experiences on own initiative after pondering over goals and meaning. I strike these low points after a lot of these. The post is kind of vague but at the same time it's a true depiction of what goes on in my mind after being more social/less scornful/more humble/down to earth than I'm used to. I turned here for guidance through the mess my life is at the moment and I got what I came for.

I remember talking with a girl once about why women never approach men and she said something like all girls are really insecure about themselves so that's why when a confident man come up and talks to her they are really into it.  What they don't know is that I am just as fucking insecure as they are!

And this whole thing about being a dominant male.  It's just not me.  I have no idea what it means to be a man.  There's a great scene in The Master where Joaquin Phoenix character gets mad at this one guy and he explodes: ""do something! say something! be a man!""  I just feel completely lost about being a typical male.

Anyways I guess I kind of got off topic but there is my rant.  I feel lost as an INFJ male and don't really have anyone to talk to.

It appears that there is a very large amount of self-described INFJs who exhibit Fi traits. They hold their own uniqueness

This is not Fe. Fe is diplomatic. It is people-centered and considers others before the self, rather than standing out from it. It reaches out to people and seeks to form connections and relationships. It is also willing to conform to social norms in order to reach this goal. *In some cases, it will even bend internal/personal rules for someone else.*

So, a value - and when they see the world through the lenses of that value, they believe they're using Ni when they take in data and mold it to fit into their belief system. While it's possible that Ni could be used in such a manner, I believe this is more indicative of Fi behavior, and Ni is not concerned with the moral implications of an interpretation. It is the foreseeing function - the ""gut feeling"" evaluation of the deeper meaning behind something, or how something will be. The problem is that symbolic, beneath-the-surface analysis can be meshed with emotional judgment and morals

I notice that many self-typed INFJs also struggle with being social and don't know how to open themselves up or form connections with others. Now...this *could* be due to high Ni and its nature of needing to think for a long time before coming out with a statement. However, using Ni to sense what the other is thinking and combining it with Fe to effectively form a connection. This isn't to say that INFJs should be extraverts; they still need to be alone to recharge, and mostly live in their own inner world of perception. However, introvert =/= socially inept, especially in the case of an INFJ with their Fe.",,False,t5_2r39a,True

* Never lie to others. Always be honest.

* Understanding is key in life. Be open about your concerns and problems. Even if you don't agree with one another

* Knowing and accepting your flaws makes you perfect.

* Be kind to others. We are all human and thus we all feel the pain others can inflict.

* You may be loyal

* Always seek to do the greatest good.

* You are defined by your actions; stay true to yourself and display it through what you do.

* Emotions are human’s greatest strength and greatest weakness. Always be mindful of yours. Ask yourself if what you feel is justified.

* Life is irreplaceable. If it is taken it can never be returned. Such choices should be made with the greatest of care.

* Remember that property is fleeting. Do not put material possessions above others.

* Help others whenever possible. People remember good deeds.

* Seek to improve yourself

* Always chose truth and knowledge over ignorance. Though accepting it may be hard

* Be humble. Everyone around you should be treated as an equal.

 I don't mean to say that that's all I have to talk about, when people ask me if I'm reading something or what I'm reading, I usually don't answer with an in depth description because they probably don't want to hear it. I don't like people knowing that I read philosophy, poetry or foreign literature, because most people don't read those things and can't relate. How am I supposed to answer what my favorite film is when my real answer is it's an existential Russian film that can't be summed up in a sentence? I've found myself really skirting around these kind of questions and straight up lying by giving generic answers. Even when I have something to say in conversations about politics or history (which I never start now) I usually keep it to myself because whatever I have to say often shuts down or hijacks the conversation. Another example, some friends were having a conversation about how great they thought the idea of communism is, but they were pretty new to the whole idea. Throughout the whole conversation I wanted to give my researched opinion that contradicted theirs and would have derailed the whole conversation. 

I have this whole other side to me that isn't appropriate to share. I can't share my interests because they won't be accepted or engaged. It's almost like living two lives at once. I like socializing with people, go to parties and have a good time, but I feel like a whole side of me is never engaged. I've tried breaching these deeper conversations with people who'd seem interested, but I haven't had a lot of success so I've become more reserved with what I talk about. I know that I can't justs drop philosophical tidbits into conversation and expect people to engage them, so I have to censor myself, but it's causing issues.

DAE have an extremely visual-based memory? I know I don't have a photographic memory, which deteriorated pretty quickly it seems, it was good when I was younger). I often do not take notes during my classes because I find myself linking the ideas of the lesson to what's being written on the board, or projected on the screen. Often times, I feel very distracted if I try to take notes, especially if the instructor writes on a board - I remember things far better if I pay attention to the visuals.

I also seem to have a very relative ""scenic"" memory, but some of the ways I've described remembering things to people led them to beleive that it was photographic memory (it's not) or unusually strong visual memory. 

I also have a way of visualizing everything in shapes (music and writing being two prominent ones). I know this is already somewhat of an INFJ trait as we see things in shapes

About a decade ago, he felt the same way I did yet could explain his views with completely different and logical reasons from my own. He also spoke with an almost Mark Twain/Southern Gentleman-esque sort of sound which is strange to see coming out of an Hispanic considering the stereotypes Hollywood has branded upon us. What bothered me is that he was much more considerate of other people's feelings than my own.  His public face was non-judgemental and socially considerate, while his private face was critical and hurtful. I eventually discovered during one session, he was ***measuring me by standards that weren't my own*** and quite impossible to ever achieve.  And so he was wrong. But he was right in trying to knock me out of the complacency and comfort zone that I'd come to depend on as my shelter in my day-to-day life. 

He is what happens when too much self-critiscism turns into self-loathing. Self-criticism when constructive and brief, right? Why the hell should you allow it to happen in your head?

However, I feel like I’m stuck on the nostalgia of the friends and adventures I had while in college and it’s been difficult for me to move on from that and just let go. 

I also have a huge problem with my confidence. I always had, no better than a speck of dust, you get the picture. It just wasn’t a very good time, and the fact that I wanted to go to art school just made it even worse. (My Father supported me, but since my Mother had failed out of art school herself, I ALWAYS heard shit from her, and my younger sister who was going to school for international business.) I’m not sure why, but I’m attracted to objects that are defected. (Only sometimes now

When my mother and I went in to see the vet they weighed him. My dog was shaking because he was so scared. The vet wrapped an elastic around his front leg like a heroine junkie. 

My dog had this head-in-the-sand reflex in pressure situations where he would put his face between your legs and he liked if you brushed his soft ears. He immediately buried his face into my mothers legs. He was a baby just looking for reassurance of safety from his mother. 

When they injected the poisons

That's how he stayed. An empty body on the cold linoleum floor. I don't know if he know it was coming.

And for us INFJs

One of my major struggles with this has been my labeling of people, I can be extremely judgmental of some people's actions if I see them as fake, or irresponsible.

I'll use my most recent relationship as an example here. I'm not 100% sure, and is probably the most extroverted person I know. She is very naturally flirty, and thrives on meeting people. She gets upset if she feels like she doesn't ""know"" enough people. Because of her extreme tendancy to live almost exclusively in the moment, and her introverted F function, at times she comes across as uncaring and out for instant gratification. To an INFJ like myself, this drives me absolutely balistic - the way it seems on the surface is that she isn't thinking about the consequences of her actions, because she's not able to see ahead to their consequences as well as I can. And her lack of ability to show her emotions deeply and outwardly makes it hard to know weather she actually cares or not. This is just one example of a person who I care about deeply, as an INFJ see as fake

I think any behavior is changeable, it won't change.

If I changed it (how easily people and relationships affect me), if I did decide that I wanted to change it, the only way I can think of doing it would be to just keep myself farther removed from people, which I've done most of my life, and I don't feel is genuine, but a really immature defense mechanism as well as an excuse for keeping people at a distance.

Here's the deal: I usually have no problem having small talk with strangers, so I can adapt to the situation without much effort and act as my more extravert and witty self. In addition, I often feel like I have nothing to lose here: I just view it as having a nice encounter with a perfect stranger, nothing more, nothing less. If it does get awkward or boring, I feel like I have every right to say goodbye and leave.
With acquaintances and friends (okay not my closest ones), perhaps because I feel like there is a lot more to discuss and I also have the idea that I have to prove myself more or something. So for example, I feel really uncomfortable talking about the weather or random superficial stuff with people I know well, precisely because I know them and I know that there are more meaningful topics to discuss. 

I figured this might be an INFJ 'thing' when I talked about this with my bf who's an ENFP, whereas for me they need to be deep and meaningful, and I would rather discuss intimate feelings than the latest episode of Girls (for example).

To avoid heartbreak or at least, post them in the comments.

1.No matter how much you love someone if you want different things out of the relationship it just will not work. Ever.

2.No amount of freedom will bring someone back if they're determined to leave.

3.Listen to your friends. Even your dumbest

4.Listen to your instincts. Self control is only worth so much if you're not willing to actually tilt an ear to the loud voices in the back of your head that tell you something is a huge bloody mistake.

5.If being around someone starts to make you feel low, your body, your music, or your friends aren't good enough and you find yourself under criticism for those things then it's best to find another person rather than try to change those things about yourself.

6.Giving in is necessary sometimes...but not all the time. If you find yourself giving in or supporting someone continuously

7.Your lover should ADD to your life rather than take away. Love isn't just give and take. It operates best when it's two people giving mightily.

8.Instead of permanence

But it reminded me of something I was contemplating last night, nuanced immensely complex culmination of a person's being. It's kind of like the difference between genotype and phenotype -- the genotype is the code, the underlying genes that make up your physicality, while the phenotype is the expression of these genes, the outward physical manifestation.

It serves as a good reminder that, in some ways, it is our differences that make our similarities all the more miraculous.

I was raised in a mind-fuck home of verbal and physical abuse.  I remember as a child I was really sensitive and empathetic.  I still am, because as a child I was constantly being mindfucked by my father (always twisting situations to make it seem like I was in the wrong, always justifying anything he was against as bad, forcing me into situations I hated, etc).  So rational thought was my refuge, my safeguard, because otherwise I was always getting sucked into the mindgames my father played.

As I grew older though, it doesn't resonate with my 'natural' side.

For example, it's only after I feel compassion.  My friends have always told me I'm really soft at heart, that I only seemed hard on the outside.

Most INFJ are no strangers to anxiety, I have addressed this issue and helped myself a great deal with a few realizations.

Big picture:  The key here is to use our extremely powerful INFJ value systems to overcome the anxieties that we consider to be limiting.  Our anxieties are a result of our perfectionism--so just create in yourself a deep, awkwardness, *imperfection* and you will be able to shut down the anxieties of almost any situation.

Since writing that post, but you can just as easily replace masculine with feminine here (hehe):  **A real man does not beat himself up over events transpired.  Rather, a real man speaks, acts, thinks with conviction--he takes full responsibility for his words, actions, ideas.  In every day of life

Edit:  The tendency of some (certainly used to be true for me) might be to try to avoid thinking about something that happened--definitely *don't* do this; the memory of the event and the anxiety/regret/self-deprecation will only pop back into your head at a later time.

***INFJ Identity Status Update:***

**Over the course of the past month:**

* Discovered /r/mbti, anger, painful emotional event, breakthrough, acceptance, revelation, empowerment

* Discovered limits

* I know myself a little better now than I have ever before. 

* I've redefined the direction of my life and my short/long term goals to accommodate to my personality type.

**The Real World Change:**

* I've learned that love is not just a feeling but also an action. So when I wake each morning

* I've changed my approach from; self-absorbed, to benevolent, grateful, and smart enough to know I should probably just shut up and listen without judgement or wisecracks. 

* I've learned by setting 3 alarms everyday to take 3 minutes to think about the important people in my life for whom I love and value. 

* At the end of each day

* I finish everyday with an ice cold shower. We have hot water but I've started using cold water to remind myself that if I am to get anywhere in life

* I've also influenced a couple of my coworkers on the drilling rig to jog with me every other day. At first they gave me excuses when I asked if they wanted to go. I told them that I wasn't trying to tease them or embarrass them. I just wanted to help them actually push for their health and fitness goals so the could spend a little more time on this earth with their loved ones.

* I no longer drink, podcasts and audiobooks.(I don't want facebook to become one.) 

* I seek out conversation with my peers whom have different or opposite views from my own. I do this to sharpen my communication skill and get a perspective different from my own. My belief is that I will never grow if I am around like-minded people. I am also very careful to never offend other's views when reaching a subject they're passionate about.

I feel if we are the couriers of a deeper truth, I struggle with anxiety and depression, but these are the torments of an artistic personality. We are all artists with different canvases, and we need to paint the world with our vision.

Roughly four or five years ago I met this friend through the internet through a mutual fandom.  I'll call her C.  I was going through a really hard time in my life, and I knew how scary it was to be in my situation.

My mother died, no place.  I'd had to take care of my mom while she was dying of cancer, and had nothing to show for it.

Finally, she pushed the timetable up, saying it had to be that night.

So my sister and I drove over 600 miles in one night to pick her up and bring her back with us to live in my new apartment with my ex-bf and me.

It took C three months to even find a job.  In that time, but I never got mad at her because I wanted to shelter her from the stress she'd had in the past.  She finally got a job that I had to drive her to and pick her up from (at 2 in the morning).

Changes happened.  My ex-bf moved out, like I was her mom or something.

Suddenly, so she isn't going to be paying rent while she's gone.  She isn't even willing to find someone to temporarily take her place in the apartment.

At this point, and I make sure she knows she needs to find a place by the time she gets back because my new place will be too small for her to stay in.

Not only do I have to move and store all of her belongings

C eventually finds her own place, I cosign on her place, assuming she'd hopefully be able to keep up such a small payment.  (Her entire payments per month, bills, rent etc come out to less than $500).

Not the case.  She fails out of school.  Loses financial aid.  And doesn't even TRY to find a job before her rent is due again.  She told me she had money for rent

Now I'm struggling to help her find cash to keep her apartment

I'm sick, and I feel terribly guilty about it.

1371133504.0,1g9ore,How do you cut someone out of your life?,firezeemissles,17,2,45,"I apologize in advance if this turns in to a wall of text. 

My ex and I were together long distance for 6 years. Toward the end of our relationship, and the way that he was treating me was bordering emotional abuse. Things got worse and worse until I was ready to break up, and I also believe that he was doing things to try to force me to break up with him. We finally split up in early spring of last year and I began dating someone new in June.

Fast forward to today. My new SO and I are so happy together. He is completely different than my ex - he is respectful of me and my needs and always looks out for my best interest. Things feel so natural and comfortable. We can sit in silence and it's not awkward, he has quickly become my best friend and I truly feel like he is my soul mate. 

The only problem is that my ex is still hanging on to the false hope that I will come back to him. He texts me randomly to say that he misses me, only to call back 10 minutes later and say that he loves and and that he's so sorry for being mean. I feel horrible knowing how much he's going through and how badly he's hurting, but I love my SO so much, and I feel guilty every time my ex tries to contact me. When he does talk to me, I will sometimes respond because I feel like I'm hurting him if I don't. However, I've made it clear to him on at least 3 occasions that I have no plans of getting back together. I don't mind him checking in with me or saying hi every now and then, but this isn't working anymore... he does not understand boundaries

I understand that I am allowing (or maybe even encouraging?) this to an extent, and I'm really dreading having to do it. I feel so guilty, and I can feel the pain that it will cause him and it makes me sick to my stomach. What is the correct way to end communication completely?

""We ""just know"" a lot of information that we can never fully explain. Many sensing types and a few intuitive types cannot fully grasp our level of intuition and easily discredit our knowledge. Without any explanation as to why

But I think it is fair for others and ourselves to question our intuition.  Perhaps our intuition will be accurate in reading feelings of individuals we know fairly well

I just worry that r/INFJ and the MBTI test may overly boost our confidence in our intuitive skills when we should always be cautious of them.  I worry that sometimes we might use the word ""intuition"" when ""assumption"" might be more appropriate.  Now I'm not saying this is always the case

To start off, again, I apologize, in case I share anything that may be considered tmi:


**When and how I found out I was an INFJ:** Took one of the many mandatory counselling tests in college. Didn't really care much for it, it's not. I learned more about myself after learning what type I am. Also, it triggered a lot of internal (mental, but due to the immensity of it all, it manifested in the physical) crisis in me.


**How other people perceive me:** Weirdly enough, against all forms of physical contact, part-time vice grip for someone's problems.


**How I perceive myself:** Mostly negative stuff like selfish, fickle-minded, judgemental. Most of it stem out of my so-called intuition (I say so-called because I can't even seem to bring myself to trust, well, myself) ie. Me trying to understand another person = me being judgemental, not really intuition.


**How I interact with people:** *I don't*. Not if I can help it. But if I have to, it can range from what would probably sound respectful (when I talk to someone I don't know) or what would probably sound like what they'd wanna hear (when I talk to someone who I know, like a friend of sorts).


**Your ideal type/past/current significant other:** Someone who will be the rock to my everything. I feel like I'm in shambles very often and I need someone to constantly hold me and tell me that I have to trust myself because it's a gift


**Other stuff that I just wanna share/get off my chest/figure out if you guys feel/do the same lol:**

- Feeling of not being able to identify who I am as a person. I can understand other people

- I recently have come to a realization that I am all for intimacy. I crave it. Although it must be said that I've never been intimate with anyone, or mentally. So I'm not sure if that's strictly 'cause I'm basically a virgin (ha, there it is) or it's really an INFJ thing. But yeah, I feel like if I ever find the right person, I want to be really intimate with him on every level. I read/watch a lot of things that involve different kinds of intimacy, and it always pulls out the same feelings from me.

- As much as I think I'm more judgemental than intuitive, not just the same level most people trust me to be lol) or really friendly.

- I'm passive-aggressive and I hate confrontation. I try to be mature about it but when things pile up, in turn, is useful at times, because I tend to become more focused on the task at hand (which is a weird reaction).

- I'm at a loss, which I thought I would find repetitive and mundane, but it turns out, I have a knack for it! Which kind of helps because I've always wanted to be a chef when I was a kid, and whether or not I wanna pursue that, this job earns me some cash and builds my resume a bit. I'm planning on going to school, but I'm not sure which career path I should take. I'm torn between chef, teacher

Negative interaction:  I always seem to misread him, I tend to go introvert and need alone time to figure out my feelings and then figure out where to go from there.  He, on the other hand, would rather handle it in a more logical fashion and talk things out then and there, which can sometimes overstimulate me, cause me stress, and make me almost desperate to get alone time; this sometimes causes me to lash out - nice me goes away and my inner bad comes out, he tends to take it personally because he reads it as me being angry at him

Positive interaction is us basically being ourselves with each other, and so our thoughts can match up and we can have a good time with it; sometimes our feelings will match up and he will bring out his feelings, albeit very rarely, but when there is an understanding between us with our feelings, it goes really well.

Well, I go visit my bf, and sometimes this means that I have to work every day for 2 entire weeks in order to get my work done. I have no social life where I'm currently living, and so my only down days are the days I spend with him. Basically, I'm giving this relationship everything I've got, but he rarely, if ever, I've been trying to juggle my coursework and relationship for far too long

I came up to visit him this past weekend for a music festival, he came back tired as hell, but he also cast me aside. He didn't want me to touch him or really be anywhere near him. That hurt so much more than not seeing him for 2 weeks. Needless to say, I was not warm with him by Monday morning, and vice versa. We didn't fight, we were just cold. Anyways, he ended up hurting himself at work and had to go to the hospital, and everything is fine now.

The term Asperger syndrome is sometimes used in the same sense as HFA, and HFA varies. There are a range of deficiencies and talents in HFA, the precise configuration of which can vary widely from individual to individual, ranged along a continuum.

There is a high correlation between HFA characteristics and those described in the Myers-Briggs INTP profile [1] description. Another theory states that Asperger's correlates to the INTJ personality type

Many of the other INFJ's I know seem to share this aversion to normalcy.  We might like calm and quiet but the facade that constitutes 'average' behavior seems nothing short of sickening to our spirits should we expose ourselves to it for too long.  

I'd like to know how you've coped or if you've managed.  My method was to abandon all pretense.  I shaved off my right eyebrow on a laugh

  So.  I live in a college town at a big state school so there are any sorts of ""crowds"" and people you can imagine.  I'd guess that INFJs are either keeping to themselves or hanging out with creative types

  My question for you basically is... where do you like to hang out?  And if you have any other tips on how I could meet some INFJs, but I realize that some of the most genuine and fulfilling relationships I've ever had (platonic or otherwise) were with INFJs... so I would like to meet more, seeing that I don't have many in my life now.  I understand you are introverts and like to keep to yourselves a decent amount, so I respect that, but when you *do* go out to places where you might meet new people... where do you like to go?

The desire to help, even when facing conflict, to do it in a sane and rational way.  If our negotiating abilities can help with that then excellent.  We have fulfilled some portion of our purpose in life.

People pleasing is another creature.  People pleasing is attempting to diffuse conflict by any means necessary, we have to make sure we have a healthy emotional base to do it from.  Constant stress will wear us down until we simply begin throwing ourselves away from any more pain of any kind.

&gt; Do any of you INFJ's have a feeling or belief that everything is connected?

I do and probably more so than many others. 

Before I start to elaborate

Yes, we already were all one at least once before. A long time ago, just moments before the big bang, we were all nothing but a blinding flash of light. One concentrated point of pure energy, seconds before this universe of ours was created by cosmic expansion. Only after the energy-density of the universe was low enough for matter to freely move around in space - allowing it to clump - could the galaxies, stars and planets form.

I think it's no coincidence that the dynamics of change &amp; progress as well as the structures of our universe, of cells, bacteria and of the internet all share very similar patterns. We (in fact *everything* there is and isn't) are nothing more but energy in heightened states of physical harmony. 

So everything is connected. We humans are connected among each other via our subconsciousness and with the internet we are now starting to connect via a conscious, nature does this too: It took around 900 million years to create life's building blocks, the DNA, but after that it only took 20 million years for it to spread around the earth's flora and fauna during a period referred to as the cambrian explosion).  

Most people aren’t able to comprehend today's developments in such a way that they could even begin to fathom their long-term implications. With an internet-capable smartphone

Smartphones put the entirety of information available on the internet at our fingertips. Wikipedia alone is an encyclopedia larger than anything there ever was (larger than the library of Alexandria) with hierarchies far flatter than anything that came before it. The monopoly on information and knowledge is crumbling before our eyes. Anyone can contribute, Wikipedia, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, you name it. We have transcended the old means of knowledge-transfer and information-sharing and are witnessing the birth of humanity’s expressive meta-consciousness.

We are somewhere at the very beginning of a long chain of causalities, as a species.

Think about it: If we are the universe experiencing itself subjectively, introducing technological evolution as a species to the aforementioned process of cosmic evolution, where this energy we once all were is starting to gain consciousness. First through the individual, through us, and now it's the species' turn. Call it the 21. century enlightenment if you want but this is happening. 

I got a little off track but I think it's necessary to understand the above to really get a grasp of what it means that we're all one and interconnected. Why we should care more about each other (this includes *everyone* and *everything*) and why we should make the best of every day we have on this earth.
I don't believe in an afterlife. I'm pretty sure that once you're dead

That's the beauty of my narrative: From the individual's perspective it encourages you to just go out into this world and live your life to the fullest - enjoy every second and regret no decision because it's your one and only life and it's yours to do with whatever you want. Your sole responsibility for having received this gift is to create the most positive and unique experience possible for you and everyone around you.  

On the other hand there's also the holistic perspective where I see this gradual development towards something truly whole (Pierre de Chardin talked about a concept like this in his Omega Point theory)

To this effect

I myself would find it highly ironic if we should ever become these glorified gods we have fantasized about and subsequently subdued to for centuries. We even created them in our image. They are the products of our minds and only by freeing ourselves and taking full responsibility for our individual and holistic existence will we be able to leap to the next stage of (physical and intellectual) evolution. Which - seen in the grand scheme of things - I'm confident we someday will.  

Until then

I've heard it repeated by plenty of people and it really appalls me to think this is how a significant part of our society *thinks*.  

You can't change people.  

Bollocks.  You change people every day.  INFJs are better at it than anyone *else* mind you

I took a girl with Borderline Personality Disorder from an annual suicide attempt since she was eleven to living on her own, right?  I changed her.  She's still screwed up, but she's *still alive* and happier than she's ever been now that she understands that somebody cares.  

Cowards think you can't change people.  Fools think you can't change people. 

People change themselves every day.  They're changed by their surroundings.  A person with enormous self-awareness can change the circumstances of everyone around them.  They can change themselves.  They can stop

A raped lesbian from Japan who lost her daughter to her insane parents who'd paid local boys *to rape her* then taken her child from her at birth by having her committed.  I helped her get her new girlfriend.  I pushed her through getting her daughter back

I changed her fucking life.  

A young transexual with her suicide *planned out* and a date set.  I dragged her out of her parent's home and into mine.  That was *six years ago*.  She's transitioned, paid her rent, and has money in the bank.   She's still my room-mate and my best friend.

Have been reading through a few posts and I really love the positive vibe and support in this subreddit. When I got my result I thought instantly that other INFJs would find comfort in each other's presence and that's what I've seen.

I'm actually nervous in that I'm thinking 'what if I'm not an INFJ' but it's weird because that alienation feeling is a characteristic being one it would seem. All of the advice and experiences shared that I've read  (just a little bit

My belief system values hard evidence over ambiguity typically, so that's okay because personality is a complex beast. 

Just had a few questions for you all. Kind of whacky but hopefully coherent. 

Do you ever feel like you are over-concerned with 'meta-problems?' Kind of like questioning the mechanism that would generate the problem in the first place. I enjoy the way I dress/look in that I feel it reflects the ""real me"" or whatever. But

What are some of the positive belief systems that govern your outlook on the world?

Do you worry about the idea of a thing more than the thing itself to the point that they become two different things? (hope that makes sense)

I find I do this in relationships and just little nitpicky signs of human respect.


Anyway I'm sorry for super long text, not a law to live by) I just felt at home and want to feel at home with people who are like-minded in some way, whatever it may be. I'm excited to see if we have drastically different beliefs that are generated from a shared underlying, unrealized belief system. Also, will update with hopefully good additional questions. I look forward to meaningful, spirited conversation to make anybody else, and myself feel respected, valued

1371788645.0,1grxq6,Please help me understand my boyfriends very confusing behavior,SpankingConfessions,15,4,17,"Hi guys

I have a boyfriend that I have been dating for over 4 years. We are in our 20's. I love him, very much. I'm just curious if any of you 'get' or do or understand these things. 

- He is moody and negative to an extent that is unusual. If he gets into a funk it is extraordinarily hard to lift him out of. 
- He criticizes me a lot, he doesn't seem to get why he shouldn't criticize me and wants to voice it rather than just letting it go; he views stuff quite dramatically a lot.
- Yet he can't take criticism
- He thinks he acts rationally
- He never feels good about himself. He hides this so well and acts so normal
- He is bitter that his friends aren't as close to him as he is to them (but by normal standards
- Almost no one but me knows this. He doesn't tell anyone else these things. I've learned this be peeling back the layers of years and years of knowing him. 
- I know he becomes frustrated with me. He almost broke up with me because our relationship wasn't 'magical' enough. He seemed sort of floored that I woke up each day, I think he learned that he really, truly loved me but just didn't APPRECIATE me.
- I must be strong. Something very disturbing in my life happened and I started to have panic attacks. He looked after me for 3 days, not just to make my life better, but to be there for him too. 
- Forgives me but struggles to forgive everyone else; the grudges thing

That is the thing. He loves people deeply and cares about them. But he also has unrealistic expectations and he doesn't appreciate them enough. I find this sad because if he did

He also doesn't love himself. If he loved himself, and I've seen that happen to him too. When he is down - and it can happen a lot because he is moody - he sabotages his relationships and thinks there is a problem with them; but then when he TRULY loses them, like how he lost me, he realized he really did love them, and they were actually great, he just didn't appreciate them enough.

And its so strange

In saying all of this I am madly in-love with him. For all of his faults (who doesn't have a truckload?!) he is deeply intelligent, has been through EVERYTHING with me, on everything that is important he is very accepting. I just find these things CONFUSING because, again, he wants relationships with people but he also seems to not like them much when he gets to know them, which I find CONFUSING! If this is INFJ behavior and any of you can relate, let me know, thanks :)

People give me the impression that they think being so honest and kind is a liability.  I even remember my grandfather shaking his head once and saying 'ahh

Anyway

My wife and sister and I are going to a concert tomorrow.  My father remarried 6 years ago to a woman 20 years his junior, as a bunch of people failed it.  They said most of the failures were passing grades, so in August, she found out she graduated.  No graduatiion ceremony, no grad party.  

So she decides to have one in september - the day of our concert.  no worries, so no chance to go on rides before the concert.  

Now, nothing else), and have food available.  She and my sister want to go.  My wife tells my sister, ""well I would like to skip the party too, but you know how 44441 is, Ill have to see what he thinks"".  

I actually dont care about amusement parks, apparently this sensitivity is related to empathy?  And is an INFJ trait?  

Sooo... my relationship with my dad has been strained over the years, but to show my dad and his wife we care.  My sister says 'well its her fault she had a party in september and not when most people have it'  except... it wasn't truly her fault, other than doing bad in class.  My wife rides the fence, and claims to be in the middle, but I know if she werent sure I want to take the high road, she would agree with my sister.  She pointed out that if the park had been open, we would have gone to the park anyway

And... I try to look hard at my own thoughts

So here is what bugs me about being an INFJ: why is it so hard for other people to 'take the high road' and do the right thing?  And why do I always get to be the LONE voice that says 'do the right thing'?  And.. it also seems most people don't seem to take honest looks at their own actions

So ultimately I have worked hard all my life to be a good person and take the high road

1370232394.0,1fk7u1,I've been listening to Brene Brown's *The Power of Vulnerability* audiobook and summarizing the book's key ideas for better understanding of the content. This applies to everyone but I figured INFJ's benefit the most from it.,NotThatRG3,14,1,4,"The book opens with this [talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7o) and leads into a talk she does at a national conference in front of a audience of colleagues. Her [audiobook](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_5?asin=B00CYKDYBQ&amp;qid=1370226808&amp;sr=1-5) is a more of talk in front of a crowd and not actually a book.

**Key Points**:

* **Embarrassment** - Embarrassment is doing something stupid which others have also probably done. Embarrassment is fleeting

* **Shame** vs *Guilt* - **Shame** is individualized to the person. What is **shaming** for me, and not even register to another person.**Shame** is a focus on self. *Guilt* is a focus on behavior. Come into work hungover, 1 hr late, and missing an important client, and you'll feel **shame**. Come into work hungover, but still manage to see the important client, and you'll feel *guilt*. **Shame** is negative as it focuses on the self. *Guilt* is positive as it focuses on the behavior. *Guilt*: I'm sorry I made a mistake. **Shame**: I am sorry I am a mistake. *Guilt* is productive and useful. **Shame** is useless and **dangerous**. ***A addict needs shame like a man dying of thirst needs salt water***.

* **Humiliation** is shame that does not feel deserved. *Some student forgets to write her name on her paper in a 4th grade math class. The teacher decides to make an example of her. 'Let me help you out by writing your name on the paper, and be carried with her all of her life.

* **Handling Shame** - Shame is like a gremlin. It dies when it's exposed to light. Shame is also like a dementor as it will suck all the life out of you. Shame has 2 phrases it repeats: 'You're never good enough.' 'Who do you think you are?' Say you're hearing these 2 phrases over and over in your head while you're trying to work and keep second guessing yourself. The minute you call a friend and admit to them what sort of gremlins are bothering you, Silence, and Judgement. It will creep to each corner of your life.  Empathy will make the environment hostile to shame and prevent it from growing and spreading.

* **Empathy** - **Empathy is the ability to see the world as others see it.** Known as perspective-taking or critical awareness.
**Empathy is to be non-judgmental**. People always judge in areas in which we are most susceptible to shame and always pick people who are doing worse than they are in that category. This is done to feel better. **Empathy is to understand another's feelings and to convey your understanding of those feelings**. Look people in the eye when they tell you something shameful. The best response is 'me too.' **Empathy is a skill**. Empathy can only be improved by offering it to and receiving it from others. Sympathy is seeing someone is in a hole and offering condolences. Empathy is jumping in the darkness of the hole and helping that person out. While sympathy worsens feelings of shame

**Myths about Vulnerability**

* **Vulnerability is weakness.** Surveyed examples of what people claimed was vulnerability: Asking for help. Saying I don't know. Sitting with my wife who has stage 4 breast cancer to make decisions about our kids' future. Calling a good friend whose child died in a car accident. Loving someone who struggles with addiction. Getting promoted when being unsure of worthiness of it. Getting fired. Initiating sex with a spouse. Sending your child to school knowing they're struggling but letting them do their 'thing'. Taking responsibility for a mistake. It's the courage to empathize and be present with someone in a horrible situation.

* **Vulnerability is something I don't do.** Often times people give excuses as to why they don't deal with vulnerability. I'm a; man, etc. Vulnerability is defined as uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure. Everyone does vulnerability every single day. If you have someone you love, can you control whether or not they'll love you back? Their personal safety? Their health? Vulnerability can be ignored or embraced, but never removed.
Life cannot be lived without vulnerability.

* **I can do this alone.** Not asking for help as seen as a huge strength in our society. Being vulnerable takes much more courage than to isolate or hide ourselves. Most people shut down parts of themselves after dealing with the pain of shame in not being themselves. Ex: I'd like to quit football and join theater but dad won't like it. I want to quit cheer and join the Klingon club but mom won't like it. Later on in middle age it's much more difficult to reactivate these parts. 

* **The trust required to be truly vulnerability is easy to obtain.** Trust requires a number of gestures, you take out a coin. The fuller it get's the more you trust and can trust that person. The more empty it gets the less you can trust them. 

**Betrayal of vulnerability**

* **Betrayal of vulnerability with someone and they use that vulnerability against them.** Having a secret shared. Having been cheated on by a loved one. Blaming. Judging. and Shaming

* **Disengagement from loved ones.** When people stop being vulnerable and fully engaged with each other. Texting or watching TV during a conversations involving emotions. Ignoring a loved one's emotions or needs outright. 

**10 Guide Posts of Wholehearted Living**

1. **Cultivate Authenticity** by letting go of *what others think.*
2. **Cultivate Self-Compassion** by letting go of *perfectionism.*
3. **Cultivate a Resilient Spirit** by letting go of *numbing yourself and your feelings of powerlessness.*
4. **Cultivate Gratitude and Joy** by letting go of *scarcity and fear of the dark.*
5. **Cultivate Intuition and Trusting Faith** by letting go of *the need for certainty.*
6. **Cultivate Creativity** by letting go of *comparison to others.*
7. **Cultivate Play and Rest** by letting go of *exhaustion as a status symbol and productivity as self-worth.*
8. **Cultivate Calm and Stillness** by letting go of *anxiety as a lifestyle.*
9. **Cultivate Meaningful Work** by letting go of *self-doubt and ""supposed to.""*
10. **Cultivate Laughter

I'm the oldest of three siblings, who is very much a ""tough-love"" kind of person, (her father was a retired army general, and she was raised much the same way.) Her natural inclination is to encourage and favor strength and self-discipline, rather than warmth and comfort, and I take after her a lot in the sense that we both see ourselves as highly responsible people, and are both a bit awkward with comforting others.  Instead, and perseverance to resolve.)  

As an adult with a job that regularly becomes quite stressful (I work as an analyst in a call center environment, and today I had my first panic attack in years due to the stress building up in several areas of my life (work, family, a recently-developed biomechanical imbalance issue with my hips causing a low-level but constant pain in my lower back and hips.)  

My experience of having a panic attack is interesting because as it is happening, that I forget to breath.  It usually takes until I'm literally hyperventilating before I recognize the physical truth that I'm having an attack.  In that moment, my mind switches from this super introverted, hyperactive panic mode, to an acute state of calm, self-awareness where the presence of other people (even those I am close to and trust, such as my boyfriend, allowing my body to self-comfort (e.g. rocking or shaking.)  I know I've always been very ""sensitive"" to the external world

This has always been my MO, but to my horror, my inclination to push him away took over.  Honestly, I have an intense discomfort with being comforted.  He is also an introvert, and cares for me deeply, and it broke my heart when he admitted that it hurt him to have me push him away, emotionally and physically.  I think my way of dealing with stress has carried over from childhood, not to deal with it at all

So, I'd love to hear from anyone who can relate, or offer practical advice for dealing with stress in a productive, non-destructive way.  I'm going to call my health care provider tonight and see about making an appointment with a therapist who can help me develop some tools for dealing with stress in a healthy way, because today I think I realized that the loneliness and shame are killing me.

The comment:

http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/16e89y/famous_infjs/c7vg1w2

My response:

Most of this response is a personal philosophy but I hope it can give some insight into an INFJs mind and if not and INFJs mind then at least my own mind and I hope it has some effect on you all. Whether it's to agree with me or to disagree and try to not be me

I'd think, and probably most of you are, just strongly in tune with what we (humans) truly want as ""an individual versus the universe"" and have the ability to separate it from what would be considered ""normal"" attitudes as to avoid brow raising. Erasing our problems from existence would be ideal in any persons eyes but the majority of the population ""buries"" these emotions because it is only one step away from going on a killing spree most people would say. We all have the thoughts but we don't act on them. I embrace these feelings and I assume it's an INFJ thing. Either that or I'm a psychopath in the making or maybe it's normal and I'm high on my self/personality. In any case, I've never done anything like that and have no intention of doing so in the future outside of self defense in regards to killing. The fact that we embrace these feelings is what makes us able to ""read"" people so well. We know what we truly want as human beings so we can easily identify what others want especially when they try to cover it up, as that is sometimes our specialty. We hunger and envy. We want to fuck, eat, laze and feed our ego. We want to amass happiness and obliterate anything we disagree with. Some have better control of these than others, as far as killing and most material goes that isn't under guard by fifty armed men. 

When it comes to ""If I ruled the world"" type of situation, I think it's safe to say that immortality is of relevance in a reasonable manner such as no one objectifying you. No one trying to stop you when you say something is to be done. I guess, having an army to act on your will is a good way to put it.

Our time on this earth in a state of equilibrium and lack of power has humbled most of us. We see what it's like to be at the bottom and then at the top and back and forth your entire life. Pain and happiness we've experienced has bestowed empathy, and luck. That empathy is what would stop some of us from obliterating things we disagree which that I mentioned earlier. Some of us feel that it doesn't have to be removed from existence and would actually ""better"" us if it were around and we learned to deal with it. My personal philosophy is that it doesn't matter what we obliterate or exalt. We are always in equilibrium. When one thing is is attained we are on the hunt for the next best thing.

I feel like my interactions with other people are *always* contrived. In other words


Probably because of this

[this comment that I posted summarizes my experience pretty well](http://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/15f7q7/ive_started_to_realise_that_i_dont_actually_like/c7m010p?context=3)

My friends aren't bad people. I just wouldn't ever tell them anything. I went through a three or four year long family crisis and never even hinted at its existence. Anyway, and I don't think that's an exaggeration. In return, this guy convinced me to believe that I'm creative and intelligent and capable and deserve attention (kinda worked), and I discovered myself that I have considerably less trouble expressing myself through writing. He was also someone I was able to help. It's not true, but I feel like I've gone through almost every possible emotion because of him. We still talk.

Now, I liked him because he seemed genuine. Then he held my hand ! so there wasn't really anything I could do to prevent myself from falling for him, at least initially. But I'm a terrible conversationalist anyway, and although I don't feel particularly uncomfortable around him, there's absolutely nothing for us to talk about. It's just weird. There's nothing except physical attraction, but even that's dwindling because it's stupid if that's all that exists. I sense that he doesn't even have stuff that he wants to say, and neither do I.  It's a disappointment. No idea whether or not it's worth it to keep trying.

Everyone! I'm also an interesting person! I have a deep appreciation for art and I take advantage of that by creating it myself. I'm not hesitant to say that I have at least some degree of talent. I'm constantly amazed by the world around me. I have the *ability* to have great conversations and be spontaneous and sarcastic and fun

* When I try to be at all introspective

* I like to think that I have the ability to fully comprehend? absorb? appreciate? the embodiment of a piece of art. I can 'be the artist' and understand exactly what they were doing. That being said
 
* I think I have a good sense of balance and organization

* I only approach people I feel superior to. Don't get the wrong impression

* Since I was young

* Nature, procrastination, perceived control, ambiguous gestures that actually mean a whole lot

* I'd like to think that I'm above being awkward. 

* I'm still not good enough. 

* I have a lot of trouble watching movies or television shows

* On-and-off nervous habits

* I used to be (in my opinion) debilitatingly shy. Then when I started high school, my self confidence was so low that I felt bad for people who even had to look at me. I keep all of this to myself. Working through it is an ongoing process but I've definitely improved.

* I still get really

* Also since I was young, I only agreed with other people and acted like his or her point of view was coincidentally also my own. 

* I affectionately refer to the method of everyday interaction with people

* I hate being late

* I can't help but defend universities, but that's different.

* I collect things. For that reason

* I cannot tell a lie when confronted directly. My failure to tell a good lie can be ignored. I can hide things. But even when I'm not lying people think I'm lying

* People never expect me to joke

* I'm patient.

* I like you.

* I probably think you're mostly nice.

My main goal in telling you all of this is to be understood. So if you do, so I sincerely apologize if a subreddit about people's personalities is an inappropriate place. On the other hand, this shouldn't be too hard to just ignore. I'm glad you guys are here, you've already helped me.

(WARNING: LONG POST)",cheatingINFJ,14,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/y4vti/i_want_to_share_a_story_i_cheated_multiple_times/

Some background is required for me to really begin. I was a loner in high school. I was the weird girl that always doodled dragons in class. I had almost no friends except for my boyfriend at the time (who was my best friend beforehand). He was the only person that had ever given me any romantic attention

My boyfriend (let's call him Sam) had a terrible case of depression. We had been dating for 2 years, completely devastated. In my emotional instability, I desperately tried making new friends at college, joining clubs, *trying* to get my mind off Sam.

One of the first people I met at college was a guy I'll call Alan. Alan was one of those charismatic, everything. I was desperate for someone to listen to me, and it seemed like he was the perfect person to just pour myself out to. I wanted to date him, but it seemed at the time that he wasn't yet ready for a romantic relationship.

In one of my classes, Rick asked me to come over to his place and hang out. After that, we went on a date and...he kissed me. Now, both of us established that we were *not* looking for anything serious yet. I liked him, certainly, but part of my desire to date him was due to wanting a rebound. He, too, so it seemed to work out for us both.

We did not expect to fall in love after just 2 months of seeing each other. He told me he loved me

...And then Sam found out about my new relationship. This is where things get messy...

He wanted to meet up with me and talk, it was extremely difficult for me to just throw our relationship away. He admitted that he still had feelings for me and that he wanted to try again. He was taking depression medication and was getting back on the right track. After all we'd been through together, I wanted to go back to him.

The problem was that my feelings were divided. I cared for Rick, but I broke up with him and explained why. It was a horrible, horrible breakup. We were both in tears. He was utterly devastated...because he found love after being dumped, and then I just took it away.

I continued talking to Alan about my life

So I settled into an uneasy relationship back with Sam. We were together, I was getting *attention* that I had barely received before, and I craved more of it.

I still also talked to Rick occasionally. He still had feelings for me

On the last day of college, things were getting really bad...

I found myself really wanting to date him. To have ""fun."" To receive MORE attention from ANOTHER guy who was willing to connect to me, as you can imagine.

Well

But, I cheated.

So...this is the part where I start to feel extremely guilty about all this *shit* I've been pulling. I had been cheating

I don't fucking know why or how, and get some kind of closure with Sam too.

So...I did that. I told Alan the truth. While it was not a serious relationship per see, amicable break). It was also at this point where I realized that I couldn't stay with Sam after all I'd put him through. So much had been broken between us, and it couldn't be put back together again. It was extremely difficult for both of us, but we completely separated. I learned that he had become a *much* happier person later on.

Well...Rick and I still had feelings for each other. Even though I should have waited longer to do it

Alan invited me over and I moronically agreed. Because we were both still emotionally close, I had cheated again...on the person who kept on sticking with me.

I felt utterly horrible. How could I do it again? I never learned at all

So I told Rick what I did, but he forgave me on the spot. I was in fucking tears. I was *amazed* at how he loved me despite what I'd done. I'm tearing up a little just typing this.

It was Rick's astonishing love and patience that changed me. I stopped cheating. I stopped wanting attention from other men. I learned that just because you're close with multiple people

I ended up burning bridges with Alan. It just had to be done

I have been going strong with Rick for 2 years now. He's graduating college soon

**So...my advice to young INFJs everywhere: *DO NOT* let yourself be overwhelmed by multiple, *very* difficult to burn bridges with those you really connect with. It was especially bad for me, because I had almost no friends in high school - and when I got to college and experienced these new connections with guys, I didn't want to throw any of them away. Wanting to be with everyone just ended up hurting everyone in the process. DO NOT try to rebound. If you get dumped, HEAL before you try another relationship. It will take lots of time, but it's so much better than rebounding and hurting people and yourself. INFJs want, badly, selfish,,False

Funny thing is, people keep telling me I might be bisexual, but afaik that would mean I'd be interested in hooking up with girls, which I am not. (**edit: fell in love with girls**, jeez, major point missed)

So. uh. I guess my questions are:

* What's your gender? What's your sexual orientation?
* Have you ever felt any sort of attraction towards the same (for heterosexual infjs) / opposite (for homosexual infjs) sex? How did you react to it? Was it an uncomfortable thought/experience? If not
* Do you think infjs are bisexual/biromantic on the most basic level? Do we really have a capability to fall in love with any person (granted they pass all the stages we like putting people through)?
* Regardless of our sexual orientation

After doing some research on the differences between INFJs and INFPs

I've long considered myself an INFJ, and make it a point to put myself in their shoes to better understand their perspective. I'm very intuitive, a pattern seeker, focused on the big picture and read between the lines.

I'm pretty selective about who I share myself with, I recently made a friend who was VERY open with me about himself. Somehow, he was comfortable enough with me to tell me that he did the same act I once committed, and that he was guilty about it. Normally, I would never tell others about what I did (especially not someone I haven't known long), but I told him that I'd been in his shoes before. I felt the need to assure him that he wasn't alone, that I completely understood, it's normally with purpose: I seek relation with others. I want to connect to people, it's incredibly hard to connect.

So, I might come across as distant and aloof. I often want to just be left alone, especially if I don't personally care for someone. It's a bit paradoxical. I like listening to people, yet...if I don't personally LIKE someone, I'll probably disconnect from them. And I feel really selfish for it; I feel like I SHOULD be there for everyone I get to know, even if I turn out to not entirely care for them. I WANT to care, but oftentimes I don't.

Now, I am also quite...well, selfish. I focus a TON on myself, who I really am, where I'm going in life (for instance, I'm just FASCINATED about which type I really am). I seethe inside if I feel that my values are being threatened, and if I'm pushed too hard, I war with myself: Half of me wants to reach out

And then there's Ni vs. Ne. While I believe I use Ni more often, it seems...

I'm unsure about whether I'm more Si or Se (could someone explain the difference?)

Some other tidbits about me... I like categories, but I'm constantly wracked by laziness. I have an innate desire to travel overseas and help people in third world countries. I think about the future all the time - the future with my boyfriend, if he'll still love me in the coming years, if my career life will be successful, if I'll have children, if I'll travel, if I'll do good in the world... I have a lot of trouble living in the here and now. I'm a worrywart. When I'm upset, I'll probably just burn it off while listening to music). I'm really bad with directions. I'm not fond of small talk (I much prefer deeper conversations), ""Can I get you something?"". I tend to expect people to tell me if they need anything. I have a really hard time ending deep relationships. Finishing creative things I start is extremely challenging for me. I don't mind deadlines (I probably wouldn't finish anything without deadlines).

Often I feel that operating my personality is like navigating through a dark maze-- the only way of finding my way is feeling this ""path"", noticing coincidences, etc. I feel like my consciousness lies in a galaxy far, far away, and that I'm not always the one in control, better put: I'm a third party observer to the beauty and chaos that is life. Do I sound like an INFJ to you?


Though life is uncertain, and in the past this has excited me and perpetuated me forward. Yet, the past few months I feel like I've been observing life through a cloud, as if my ""maze"" is filled with a smoke, so to speak. I feel like I've lost my drive to pursue my arts (I create films). 


The weirdest thing is that I have a voice telling me that despite my mentality, actually, this is correct. I haven't stopped making films, finding work, writing, exercising, etc. Considering that, the internal world is another story.


I feel as my intuitiveness is diminishing, and an illusion of uncertainty, because I'm certainly still pressing on towards my ambitions, but I don't feel as passionate nor driven towards it, if that makes any sense.

INTJs express things (especially emotions) somewhat differently than other types and everyone seems to have problems with these expressions (except maybe other INTJs). In my opinion, how do you know when you are wrong about what you've ""read"" from them?  From an INTJ perspective, a well thought out, logical argument seems to do little to convince an INFJ that they're mistaken about an INTJ expression (as well as other things but that's a different story). Seems that in order for an INFJ to be convinced that they were wrong, they have to ""feel"" that they were wrong. Which seems like nothing short of time traveling to re-experience an event will give that feeling.

In all my introspection and soul searching I do believe I have come to an understanding that I am satisfied with. I dont really fear death or the dark and I dont believe that humanity can go down the wrong path for too long. I am sure that others have reached similar conclusions and some people on this Earth can probably take it a step further

I look at religion and dont really get anything from it. It all seems too petty and small minded and human. So tossing out religion I am left with Atheism and that leaves me with ""The world is shit and everyone is shit

In my bad space I begin to ponder. I stop to think about how crazy huge our universe is and all that good stuff. Then I move to our lowly planet and all its life. The bacteria in my gut, myself all have life in common. We all aim to reproduce and better survive and we all work together to do so. 

Even if we dont have an understanding of how life started or a definite ""purpose"", and cover it with a foot of asphalt, but leave it for a couple years and youll have some weeds popping up in some cracks. You cannot stop it. Not even a meteor. 

Humans are at that point where laying our seed down isn't a primary concern. If we dont need to reproduce and we have access to basic resources


Technology doubles in speed and power every 18 months or so ( [moore's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law) ). Knowing this we should reach a point where discoveries are almost instant. That said


Energy is the main source of evil as far as I can see in the world. Gas costs money, but you get it. With technological advances so quickly arriving at our doors, free energy is inevitable even if the greedy bastards dont like it. 

You have an energy source that costs nothing and you then have people working an awful lot less to get what they need. This gives them the opportunity to learn more

Say you trip acid and write a song. I am driving home from my shitty day at work all stressed out

I've had a few friends pass away that were pretty close to me recently

Back to the free energy thing. Socialism and Communism in theory work well

Well say we have to work a lot less because we dont have to pay as much for things. I can work a little extra at my job and get that Porsche and so can my neighbor if he wants. Everyone would have a much more fair opportunity at life. People would have a much more level playing field because you dont have someone holding all the power


I think about the greedy fucks at the top and I wonder. You have to be pretty smart to get to the top of the world in terms of power. If you are there, these people would come to a similar conclusion about everything. Maybe they are just messed up in the head, but I almost wonder if things arent being pushed by these folks into something better. I guess I dont understand all that. 


My whole point though

I think if we continue on our path though

Perhaps some other life forms have done that and that is how life on Earth started. 

People talk about aliens and how they would bomb us and destroy our planet or take our resources if they found us. I don think this is the case. In order to come here


In our lifetime we will see some crazy shit and I think that everything is on the brink of a calm positivity. Probably not without struggle

What I learned about exposing yourself to close friends:

* Be damn well sure they are a close friend
* Inform them of your sensitivity on the subject and that if they wish to hear it
* Or say ""No."" 
* What learned to say: ""Some people get embarrassed when talking about themselves. I can slide into a full-on, to not put me through that ordeal. Maybe one day in the future but not today.""

In terms of my personal timeline- I have a very long way to go. 50, I'm not pressed- I don't 'hurry' when it comes to personal task. I frequently lose chunks of time(I.e. growing out a haircut, the time between health appointments). I'll be going for my post secondary after we decide on if we're having a third, at the moment it's not high priority. I'm a SAHM so my time sense is a bit skewed by that as well, totally admit it. I have to set reminders for playgroups etc. because otherwise I'm not sure what day of the week I'm on. Husbands shifts make for screwy time keeping as well, although he's a well oiled clock.

I take appointments/meeting times very seriously and am present 5-10 minutes ahead of time- the only time I was late to work was my ride never showed up and I walked. Punctuality= courtesy for me.

Then, hurry, stop, weekend, speed up again. It baffles me why everyone around me works their asses off to run away to someplace sunny for two weeks of the year- then the rest of the year is spent fantasizing about those weeks off. I know, vacations are nice. I just know too many folk that work themselves into this frenzy instead of being able to relax(gotta go sightseeing, try all the available activities/amenities) that frankly? Their vacation is more work than being able to process any one thing. If they are processing I have no idea how. Or relaxing. Don't get it.

Now, and ended up with a rather noticeable hole in her dress. But, I remembered my identical shirts which were pretty much the exact shade of her dress.

I told him to call me if anything went wrong with his car and I'd be more than happy to take him and his brother to Houston, and, even though I SHOULD have just gone home (after having spent the night at his place), instead I went and filled up on gas, bought a couple bottles of water, and was on my way to a nearby coffee shop to wait for his phone call

I didn't even make it to the coffee shop before he called and asked if I'd still be willing to take them


To me, and it's sort of a weird feeling.

Well when I see someone post on facebook I usually look at it from a different angle and like an idiot post my thoughts.  Some things can make basic logical sense

Just look at the idea of free will.  If we had it... why do people worry how their kids are raised?  Aren't they going to just turn out how they want to anyway?  And if you admit that kids are a product of their environment... how can you hate a kid who grows up to be someone following those environmental factors.  Science is proving this, than I am fine with it no matter how unwelcome it is.  But.. it seems that every other human being is not like this, at all.  The idea of free will applies to so many ideas in society, it pops into my head in almost every conversation.  ""That guy is scum, he deserves to go to prison and get raped""  All I can think is ""damn if that guy was born in Bill Gates' household, it is almost assured he would not be where he is.  How can we really hate that guy""?

My favorite example: I read once about a woman who had trouble with relationships, friendships, and holds a job.  Well, what about someone halfway between that woman and 'normal'?  That woman just gets labeled a bitch, and written off by everyone.  But she is likely not having enough problems to get a test or think there is something really wrong with her.  And there might not be, she just has more of a hormone in her body than most people.  But, it makes her personality clash with others.  She drew the unlucky straw out of the gene pool.  Bad enough to cause problems, or are likely to even look for a medical reason for the problem.  And no one cares.  

Anyway, and then I am the guy that ruins the party.  My dad is a thinker like I am but he avoids unwelcome truths like this, so even someone who seems to have a similar personality to me ends up getting irritated.  

Sigh.  Anyone else like this?  This INFJ forum is my only hope to maybe find someone who understands and can maybe offer advice.

He's an extrovert, something to thrive for. He seems to not grasp this concept in any regard. I've always felt he's not as good of a person as I would like to be. I love helping, going the extra mile for others, caring, letting them lead if that's what they seem to like... but with him, if I let myself be this way even for a tiny moment he seems to instantly take this for granted, demand for even more and never once return any sort of similar courtesy.  
I feel like I have to be on full guard alpha male 24/7 while with him, I'm just trying to be a good person and I *like* being kind. On the same time I'm feeling as above his level of intelligence, too. Perhaps he's feeling threatened? Everything is always a competition, or am I causing it myself by the very *""feeling above his intelligence""*? Can we never be just equals then, must it always be rivalry? If I ""win"" I would actually like to *let him win*, which I can't do, so instead I'll try to be as humble about it as possible, he'll be as if it's the normal

He has no problem farting whenever it's just the two of us (asserting dominance? :D), just for a little while.  
Yesterday I didn't say a word to him during a 50 minute bus ride, but after months of being the sole recipient to this vocalization of near constant stream of thought I've grown extremely annoyed at it) and also to myself for becoming such a person who's letting myself be annoyed by all this...  
One time he said I'm grumpy and bitchy like I'm on period, but rather because it shifts all the blame on me, like I'm the weirdo and it's my fault feeling trapped, worn down and squeezed out. I'm not saying it's his fault either, I'm just looking for a way out of it. I don't want to start any kind of confrontation, I don't want to talk it out with him because this way I'm admitting there's something annoying me and again instantly I'm the whiny one with the issue. I feel like screaming ""shut the fuck up and let me be, I can simulate every single fucking reaction you make in my head and it's driving me insane because I could literally say what you're going to say next a second before you do because we've spent almost every minute of every day together for the last half a years and my head is filled up of *you* to the last drop."" Instead I keep my mouth shut and say something along the lines of ""ah fuck off what ever man."" 

He seems to effortlessly keep going, while I feel like an empty sack of a last endangered animal withering away having been pumped free of some odd sparkly juice. 

So what the hell do I do. There's still months before we can even hope to go our separate path. I'm really losing myself here, feeling terrorized, trying to think my way into accepting the situation, searching for solutions while slowly feeling the core *me* changing into something I despise.

For background, but the conversations lack the depth I need.  About five years ago, I underwent some significant life changes that involved the sudden ability to lucid dream.  

Now

Now, about myself, about anything.  Here’s the funny thing that I imagine you’ll appreciate: at least half of the dream characters I encounter have NO IDEA what I’m talking about.  Some blankly stare at me, some cry, some run away, etc.  For example, I might say, sir.  Do you have a moment to talk?  Great…well I wanted to inform you that we are inside of a dream

I have somewhat of an idea for the reason this occurs, I believe some of the traits of INFJs – restrained emotion, composure, an interest in the esoteric – make us ideal candidates for lucid dreaming, given the right circumstances.  I have to be in a healthy routine and avoid too much stress during the day.  Yoga and meditation certainly help on that front.  If dreaming is not something pay much attention at the present, I would encourage you to give it a second thought.

I posted here a while back

1) Nearly all the profiles and many self-descriptions say that INFJs tend to dislike conflict and to avoid it as much as possible.  For me, but I have no qualms about getting into passionate debates about moral or political issues.  When I was on my university's SGA executive board, I was usually the person picked to defend the board's ideas when we took them to the floor.  This ""love of battle"" seems non-INFJ to me, but maybe I'm wrong.

2) After reading [this post](http://personalitycafe.com/infj-articles/68718-really-me-how-stress-brings-out-infjs-hidden-personality.html) on PersonalityCafe, and the one I would use if I could, is to separate from the situation and recharge in solitude.  Unfortunately, I'm currently living with my parents to help them take care of my grandmother, and the small house and nearly daily ""babysitting"" duty do not allow for much privacy.  For instance, I can hear my grandmother's TV from anywhere in the house, and she watches it nearly all day, because I'm constantly getting called to help her with something.  To be clear

I have a story for you. Its about my self perception of being an INFJ

In my teenage years I labeled myself an INFJ. I cried a lot in my younger years. I thought I was an emotional person who was reserved. Sounds about right - I'm an INFJ.

As a result, I learned to really embrace it and develop strong empathy for others who undergo emotionally traumatic events. I learned to dig deep into myself and 'feel' the reason of the way I ticked.

Ten years after finding out what I am

What?

Certainly this couldn't be right - I know I act extroverted, but how else could I explain my *emotional* childhood...?

Then, reserved childhood and adolescence was not all me. Upon reflection, my tears and being shy wasn't because I couldn't make friends. Or that friends would make fun of me. Or that I wasn't good at school or that people hated me. 

I was an emotional reserved child and adolescent because I was emotionally abused.

It has been such a long time since I've thought about it - that stuff has been tucked away for over a decade. But all the times I've felt bad and cried severely was because my father would verbally abuse me. 

The abuse turned me inward. The abuse made me emotional. As a young child who only blamed himself for weakness, MLK and Plato in high regard and are values that guide my life.

But in many ways, I was often called the ""Bossy kid"" on the playground. 

Teachers loved me, and in college I became a club president and led a small group of student-veterans for the Occupy Los Angeles movement. In most classes in High School and College, I get to know at least half the people in a class.

Interestingly

In everything I did, therefore I should do it too. Nah, I was just developing my inferior functions. No wonder it was so hard!

I don't know if there really is a point to this post. If anything, teaches how to learn how other's tick. 

Now that I've been working on my tertiary and inferior functions for so long

* I *think* I'm fairly empathetic for an INTJ. I generally try not to hurt peoples' feelings. If my thoughts are going to upset things
* I get upset about stuff like such as womens' political issues (ex: rape cases)
* I'm emotionally expressive with people I'm close with and am able to analyze and clearly describe how I feel. I would describe myself as very in touch with emotions. 
* My feelings can and do get hurt
* I value sincerity and genuineness in people
* I strive to be compassionate and believe it should be one of the highest values for all humans (this is kind of a religious/spiritual thing though).

My main theory as to why I'm like this is that I'm a woman, which forced me to observe my feelings. I also have taken plenty of shrooms and MDMA, which I believe gave me a mellowness about life among other qualities that other INTJs stereotypically lack.

However, I don't feel like expressing emotions over it because there's nothing I can do about it, and so it would be a waste of time and energy. I love these two, but from my perspective, they feel too much sometimes when they don't have to and could be conserving their mental energy.

Of course

I know I'm very Te because I LOVE efficiency and planning and tend towards it even without thinking

I don't think I'm Fe because I just don't really care about people. I'm just not really interested in them unless I think they could be useful/interesting to me, but I think small talk and the flirting/dating game are total wastes of time. I don't adjust my behavior to others unless it's a survival thing (ex: the workplace). The Fe characteristics apply to me when I'm with people I care about, otherwise it's not me at all.

The INTJ's Fi quality allows me to determine if people are fake or good or whatever

It goes from trance to rap, country, folk, soundtrack, dance, classical, 40's &amp; 50's music all the way to 90's and 00's. Oriental music? No problem. Some old school french bal-musette? No problem! Listening to scottish bagpipes or soviet red army choir? Jazz? Funk? Soul? Reggae? Harder styles of electronic music? I just can't hate a music genre. If a song is good I'll listen to it, Rebecca Black's friday was so bad it was actually good in some way. And then I'm off to listen to some Sabaton

That's why I hate questions like ""What music do you listen to?"". And when I say everything they imagine like pop and rock. No! I mean literally everything!

It's same with movies. I can sit through a tear jerking drama (yes, horror, cartoons, comedy, old classic movies... It just doesn't matter!

And because of all this, unusual, etc. by people. I don't mind.. maybe I even like it. Maybe that's why I can't find a girlfriend.. I'm looking for one who shares all this... One I can listen to everything with. Watch every movie. I dont' like it when people are narrow-minded.

I'm not the kind of guy who shoves you his CDs into your face yelling ""LISTEN TO THIS

Despite my introverted and social shyness personality I chose an interesting profession. Ambulance nurse (it's an european thing). No problem with seeing tons of blood, piss, puke and awful smells. But seeing an animal hurt or being tortured? Can't stand it! Fills me with rage!

I am more self aware and I try to be as much as possible. I can talk myself away from things most of the time

I spend most of my time in my office working on electronics and occasionally have to go into the world with other people which is fine. I consider that an outlet. 

My problem comes when I have situations of uncertainty and I start to over analyze things and I get negative and spin down into a state of anxiousness where I feel like I might explode. I cant sit still, but I shouldnt do that all the time. Occasionally I will lay down on the floor and sort of meditate for a minute, but that could get me in trouble too. 

Note that this is not all the time and I dont think I should be put on anti depressants or whatever. I dont want to be on them at least. 

I will say that since I have ""figured myself out"" or rather learned that I am an INFJ and what that means and understand why I do and think what I do. My life has changed a bit. I used to take naps every day after work because I was so exhausted

Again Im sure I am preaching to the choir

Back to the question at hand. I have noticed that I have started to have anger issues over things I think should really be trivial. The only reason I bring them up now is because there is a chance you all may have advice to help, especially when what I said wasn't wrong to begin with or doesn't really warrant said correction.

For example: you say the sky looks really blue today. Someone chimes in with, it is more of a periwinkle."" Is that really necessary? Was I really so wrong I needed to be corrected? It may be who I hang out with, but I feel like I am constantly told I am wrong. People say things all the time that are incorrect, or they use the wrong word for something, but I GET what they mean and I just don't think pointing out to someone the subtle differences between what they said and what the mean is really helpful or productive. If you understand me, can we just move on? Also, why do people feel like they are such authorities on everything? No one knows everything

Anyways, rarely contribute to a conversation unless I know what I am talking about or can back up something I am going to say. So, when someone ""corrects"" me, I can't help but feel slighted, especially when the correction really isn't adding anything or the correction is wrong to begin with. Another example is I will be studying with friends, I say something, they tell me I am wrong, then I come to find out that I was in fact correct. It is just such a mindfuck for me. I start doubting myself and feeling stupid for saying something incorrect

The second half of my title deals with me not liking advice. Of course, like their way is the only way.

So for a quick introduction -- I'm new here and I just recently got into personality profiling. I've taken the MBTI personality tests in the past and I've always gotten INFJ, but I want to dig deeper and no, I won't pay to learn more about what I already know about myself.* 

Then, I've started to become more aware of what I do in my day to day life and how I feel in my interactions with others. 

This brings me to how I felt when I was shopping yesterday because I was reminded of how I used to really hate shopping in my teens (which, I would always end up buying something I **didn't want** because I felt like they'd be hurt if I didn't buy whatever it was they were helping me with. Now this person didn't have to be the best salesperson in the world, they just had to be nice &amp; kind and I'd feel bad if I didn't buy anything. Obviously, I've grown a lot and now I can say that it isn't exactly what I want and walk away feeling okay, but when I was younger I could've never done that. 

So I'm wondering if any other INFJs out there have experienced similar feelings while shopping. Did you feel compelled to purchase something you didn't want because you didn't want to make the salesperson feel bad? I guess I'm wondering is this an INFJ thing or just a me thing?

Then the other day I was looking at descriptions of the [cognitive functions](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/213-MBTI-Descriptions-of-cognitive-functions-from-various-sources) linked from /r/intp and realized that though Ne did resemble me, even my Ti. Funnily enough, Ni isn't supposed to be one of the functions of an INTP. I took a cognitive functions test that confirmed my suspicions and asked on /r/intp for advice. The three biggest lines of suggestion were:

* You're an ISTP. (I think I can pretty safely rule this one out; N is the descriptor I am most certain about of them all)
* You're really an INTJ. (Same problems as before)
* You're an INFJ.

""INFJ"" as a static label

* I-E is where we get our energy from

* N-S is how we perceive the world and take in information

* F-T is how we prefer to make decisions (do we go to the head or the heart space?)

* J-P is our orientation towards the external world. 

All of these energies are available to us. Strange

Not so much ""high esteem"" or ""low esteem"" but instead ""esteem"" towards yourself. There is no need for labels, because you already have esteem which opens up the gateway to others.

That you don't need to put what you know and see deeply into words. It is fine as it is. You know in your knowing. Sit with it. Hold it. The opportunity to voice those deep answers come in their own time

My girlfriend / the girl I am talking to (we dont have a specific title) is an INTJ. She and I talked about 2 years ago and things didnt work for a lot of reasons

At the time I was completely shocked. ME? I DONT SHOW ENOUGH EMOTION? I have more emotions than anyone else I know. How the hell is this possible? I am crazy about this girl and she thinks I dont like her. Upon looking at things I was pretty reserved

This time around I decided to make a better effort at saying what was on my mind and not thinking about it or worrying about it. That has gotten me further than I anticipated. 

Anyway, new products, just everything was pretty cool. I was having a good time taking everything in and following her around for grocery shopping. 

I told her to ask me any time I was outwardly confusing or looked upset. She asked me how I was feeling at lunch and I take that to mean that I look troubled. 

So after we get food and were in line she apologizes for putting me through the act of grocery shopping. I am pretty confused. She said I didnt look like I was having a good time. That I looked a bit miserable. I understand thinking I am not excited because I never get excited about much of anything

At that point I just felt bad and awkward. Trying to think about how to show how I felt on the outside. It seemed kind of impossible to do without seeming completely fake and wrong if even then. 

I brought up the whole situation and said that it made me worry I dont show enough emotion all the time / unintentionally give her the wrong idea about ""US"". 

She said she feels like this about half of the time we are hanging out. That I am just completely unable to be read. I asked some of my friends and they said the same thing. 

I know that sometimes I shell up intentionally

I will tailspin when asked about how I feel sometimes just because I am expected to put words together quickly about emotions and emotions are hard to explain. More than that

That hyperbole and a half comic that came up the other day pretty well explains myself for the past couple years. I never really looked at life as being depressed

Lately I have been feeling some pretty strong emotions. The first one would be anger. I get REALLY angry pretty easy now. I have almost no patience for bullshit and inconsiderate people. I get hypersensitive to everything around me even the guy punching numbers in the ATM. Every little number tone makes me angry for instance. 

The next would be just a feeling of calmness. I am not depressed about the world

I find it easier to get up for work in the morning, but I dont get any extra sleep either. 

The past couple days especially I have noticed myself laughing pretty hard. Two occasions I caught myself laughing probably too hard at things like a youtube video. I dont really emote much even when something is hilarious

The last and most notable feeling is probably the bond I feel with her. I would say this is most definitely love. I promised her I would try to get things down and explain them to her

I have never felt so deeply for anyone person in my life. I am absolutely crazy about her. Not in an unhealthy way either. I tried to explain things last night, but how am I supposed to sum that up? I wish I could give her a box with my emotions in it so that she could be blown away with understanding (actually that might be a bit scary, but fuck it.) I do know that in some of our  harder times I could feel this welling inside of me as I held her that felt like an indescribable mix of excitement, fear, care, and just raw emotion. A totally new emotion that I can seriously only describe as love. A feeling that at that moment she was all that mattered and that she cared about me and that everything would be okay because we had each other. 

I could probably go on and on

A lot of the things I feel with her are new, but I really dont want to fuck things up with her. I cant. 

Sorry for the novel; and even if nobody reads it


Edit: I feel the need to add that she is quite good at understanding me. We are on the same page most of the time. We have similar thought processes and reach the same conclusions and if I am really troubled about something she ""knows"". This is about the times where she doesnt know. She is a thinking type and I am a feeling type and I think that is the issue here in addition to us just being tough to crack.

  NTPs are the playful geniuses of the world. Everything is an experiment, respectively, seems very apt when describing these optimistic system builders. This optimism isn’t without great cause though: An NTP may see a single flower growing on war-torn dead land and feel hope, because they know a flower could repopulate the lands as opposed to the symbolic joy an NFP may feel.

  NTPs have the power to teach and show an NFJ how to utilize this ability to evaluate new situations fairly and accurately use their logic to make good decisions. NFJs strong dedication to cause may be revealed to be misplaced and better warranted elsewhere. Many NFJs fail to realize their sense of what they want and need to realize goals is often as weak/under-nurtured as their critical thinking

  So how can you start? Try to start your day with a different perspective, through the symbolism NFJs seem to grasp. If something makes you uncomfortable there, chances are it has a real life parallel, or a change in perception is required. I recommend sitting down with relaxing music on and letting your mind wander; visualize yourself in a different world and explore.

How I relate to INFJ:

* I'm always paying attention to the emotions of the people around me. The Fe in me feels pretty strong even though I have a rough time articulating.

* I crave meaning in my work. Sometimes this means I have to invent meaning. Other times it means I have to work by proxy (I'm doing this now because it means I can do that later.)

* Definitely an introvert who feels weird a lot. While I enjoy manifesting a little weirdness in front of close friends

* I've noticed I have a tendency to fall in synch with all my relationships. While the ESP I feel is not as intense as those experienced by many of you

* I do not live in the ""destroyer of worlds"" mindset, there are times it feels like a blissful alternative ...

How I don't relate to INFJ:

* I don't trust my ability to think into the future. Whether it's a manifestation of upbringing or what, if I think about a situation too long, I tend to dwell and let it fester. I end up so upset in the contemplation that I'm derailed.

* I feel like an open book ... except I don't. This one is a little harder to explain since it's the area where I'm really unsure. I have an incredibly difficult time suppressing emotions. You'd know if I don't like you. Also, it tends to be reductive. I feel as though my emotions are being simplified - but I wonder if the problem before was that I was inflating them. In short, are there really layers or am I complicating things in hopes of creating personal depth?

* Then another part of me feels like any of this simplification is done as a function of the Fe. I know the feelings of the people with whom I'm discussing emotions. So when they offer advice or insight, not the whole string.

I'm having a hard time sorting this out and trying to make it as brief as possible (yeah

I don't want to be deluded in thinking that I'm a complex and special snowflake just because of a few tests and feeling some connection to what a lot of your posts have said. I'm fascinated by INFJ and how it can implode through the sheer force of its own gifts. And if I really am INFJ

This is something that feels correct to me

As an INFJ, so on and so forth. But where does this guilt come from? 

Often times, and, if I'm not doing it, I start to feel like I'm not a good person. I'm not formally thinking it, but that knowledge has become an essential part of who I am. My brain, without my knowledge, makes all of my decisions within a framework that contains and considers the many facts and judgments I have obtained. 

So, and I'm finding it surprisingly successful.

The first example that comes to mind involves leadership. I've always been reluctant to take on a leadership role, or to really sheepishly lead if forced. Perhaps because I had the knowledge that other people, NOT like myself, desire leadership, I should just leave it to them to enjoy. I perceived leadership as something desirable, so denied myself it.

Then, and is not at all desirable. In fact, most people prefer being led and being told what to do (within reason/decency). This is, of coursed, based on reading which I considered to be factual and scientific. 

Because, unless you reject them, my brain redid my associations with the concept of leadership. Instead of being something that other people desired, and that I should let them have, I began to view it as a burden to be taken up for the good of others. And, therefore, good people take up leadership when in situations where others do not appear to want it, logically

Now, hey, maybe I'll be a leader more often"". What I think makes this sort of thing especially powerful for us is that... I never tried to logic myself into taking on a leadership role. Ever since I made these new associations, I've felt emotionally driven to take on the leadership role when I should-- I feel guilty for rejecting the burden, and so I must take it on in appropriate situations.

So, but that I believe makes up the most of who I am... has shifted.

I lock my door upon myself

And start self-purged upon the race  
That all must run ! Death runs apace.

And start with lightened heart upon  
The road by all men overgone!

Can roll the strangling load from me

About a month ago, but I didn't mind once that it could possibly be my only one. Anyway, we broke up and I pushed through finals; it was the toughest month of my life. 

This whole summer, and working out. In the break up, I lost all my best friends, so I have no close friends here I can talk to or go to for support. I have friends I can hang out with, but it's not the same. No one quite understands me like my INFJ best friends used to. 

I've read tons on /r/breakups, and wondering how she is doing.

I know it's not true, but I feel like I'll never anything that matches up to what I had with her. We clicked on every level, from our basic interests to politics/religion/sexuality. I never really got a proper closure either, so maybe that is why I'm still hung up on it. I'm trying my best to move on by constantly engaging my mind in other things, and I know she would've been delighted. It's just so hard for me to snap out of it

I feel so pressured for my MCAT, and I'm really afraid of what I could find there. I know the experience can be amazing, but what if it's actually horrifying? All that money would be going to waste. There's no guarantee for medicine there or anything.

Over time, you can learn which pursuits are likely to be rewarding.” Players may seek points alone or in the company of a life partner. Neither way is more correct than the other: travel and treasure gathering are easier for the agile solo player, there are no multiple lives. “Your score looks pretty meaningless hovering there above your little tombstone

I recently joined a community where I meet up with other high schoolers and a couple adults a few times a week, I mean I consider them my friends. I don't dare to try and unload the stuff that fills my head just yet. However, there's a lot of things that happen with these people.

1. There is this one person who is supposed to be my mentor. I've looked up to him and almost idolized him for a while

2. The people in this community are VERY nice people. Or at least the ones I care about. So I know they won't tell me if I'm being a burden on them. So I worry and I worry and I worry that this whole time they're thinking

3. No one in this community, is an INFJ. No one can understand me and that frustrates or confuses them sometimes. Or, it just slides off of them and they don't sense it at all and they do something that just hurts me further.

1348951053.0,10ojgk,"How seriously do you take typology? How do you use it, view it, and on how deep a level do you identify as your type?",Valkyrian,10,5, how you use it

When I was younger, I didn't fully understand who I was. It was a time where I was trying to figure myself out, but simultaneously, I had an *ideal* of who I wanted to be, which was really nothing like who I am at all. It's kind of hard to explain, but this ideal was something that I *thought* I was like, but it wasn't actually true. For example, I liked those silly personality quizzes (""What element are you?"" ""What animal would you be?"" ""What is your superpower?"")

Eventually I grew out of that, and I wanted to. Note, I was not the type of person who hated labels; while I was aware that the human mind is an extremely complex web that goes far beyond ""typology"", I also believed that there had to be certain ways to categorize common thought patterns and mannerisms. I noticed similarities between people as well as differences, and I was interested in these similar tendencies.

A friend of mine had me take the MBTI test; I'd taken it a few times before, and all of a sudden, I'm reading articles all about myself - no bullshit, things that *actually* fit. It was an extremely interesting and strange sensation, discovering accurate descriptions of your mind when you've never been able to describe it yourself, and gaining a better comprehension of your thought patterns and how they work.

I like identifying as an INFJ, I am aware that it isn't *all* of who I am. It describes many things about me accurately, and that's what I find really interesting, but I remind myself that type is not what truly defines a person. Because I'm a person who loves categories, I'm more prone to boxing people in, but I've been trying to not fall into that nowadays. Identity and authenticity are things I will always still value, but I've been trying to keep MBTI at a safe distance of study rather than treating it as the Human Mind Bible.

Nowadays, be-all of one's being. I think it's a fantastic way to start learning more about yourself and gain a deeper understanding of why your mind might function the way it does. It can offer explanations for why people think in certain ways. There are disagreements I have with some of the deeper aspects of the system and how functions are ""supposed"" to work, and there are many other things I don't quite understand either. It's flawed, no doubt; but it still offers many interesting concepts that I find really fun to speculate about. Am I obsessive? Well, most would probably assume I am from this super long post and the frequency of my activity here. I guess I just like talking about myself, and INFJ characteristics are parts of me that I can more easily discuss with those of a common mindset.",,,,

3. Confidence is absolute key in this life. It's how we get our causes across. Forever we live with an ounce of burning anxiety in our chests and we learn to conquer it. How would you chaps vent your confidence towards life?

This story was about a sweet girl who was given to live for thousands of years to save the lives of everyone on her world.  Her friends and family weren't.  They died around her of old age.

I don't know about you but I spend most of my days quietly hiding from inevitability of this kind.  We are in the most interesting century in the most interesting eon that there has ever been.  The Singularity is breathing down our necks.  Total social collapse could happen at any moment.  Financial ruin is coming this year. 
Transcension theory says that within what could be our extremely long lives we might develop technologically and intellectually to the point we're no longer bound by space and time.  

We might exist in almost endless security living in inner-space.  We could become product of our own will rather than the whim of physics.  This nebulae wherein we have been birthed from star-stuff might be womb and cradle for a new collective of entities breathing neutrons and dancing with quarks. 

I find this at odds with so much of conventional wisdom.  Death is inevitable.  Change is always for the worse.  Pain is part of living.  

Why?  We have but one life and therein we're told these things are permanent and unchangeable yet the car has existed less than a hundred and fifty years.  The cell phone

Why should I have been told so much to fear impermanence?  Why this insistence on accepting death or escaping it through 'divine favor'.  Pray and God will make sure there's a happy ending.  

Fuck God.  

Why can we not make this ending ourselves?  We may live to transcend.  You and I

What will it feel like?  What sensation will there be?  

Will we fear?

Will that be the end?

You’re 49 today

Because this is harder than expected

I just want to be family

I grin and laugh and I live a life that is truly mine
But I’m just buying time

Do you care that I exist?

I’m your only child
I’ve tried to be good and never considered going wild
I’ve tried to make you smile

But now I’m out of plans
I have loved you
I can’t make you into a new man

So this is goodbye for now
If you decide I’m worth my salt I’ll be around
But I can’t let you hold me down

You don’t miss me

About a month before the LSAT, he asks for space (he's an INTJ), and the relationship and friendship ends just like that.  He eventually comes back and rejoins my group of friends, but still ignores me and somehow my life fell into ruins.  I had to move in with my parents for the year (and had zero structure in my days, which was extremely stressful for me-i took up yoga and went to the gym daily), he got to stay on campus close to our friends who were still living there, some times we can be friendly towards each other and at other times I can tell that he wants me to not be there. I have also seen him get a lot closer with one of the other women in the group.

This is the issue at hand: I became really needy with my friends, but this one I didn't know how to handle and I broke down.

There once was a man with a subtle smile and kind features

He would bend over backwards and deliver his best

And many a time would hinder himself for the good of the rest

He never lacked for company or hoards of good friends

He enjoyed drinking and merriment and a good roast now and then

He made sure everyone possible would be having a good time

He heckled and chortled and knew perfectly all of his lines

He was sweet and emotional and was coined a ""nice guy""

He pretended to be tough

He was loyal and honest and would do anything for those close

Friends and his family loved him

But underneath it all brewed a stormy interior

Far away from the laughs

He longed for passion

But alas everywhere he looked he was met with none

His face would never say it
misery

His soul cried out for someone to help and relieve him from this tyranny

But his outer shell was as masterful and thick as could be

It was impenetrable

He contemplated death often

So many people would be confused and angry with this unforeseen happening

So he continued to live

A world

He lived each day like the last

He wished more than anything for death

More often than not he sat by himself in the bleachers

There are differences between us obviously with the greatest difference being our experiences leading up to where we are now as well as my continual introspection as well as mind-set changes since the age of around 20. 

I feel at times there are so many things I should be telling her

What would the best approach to this be? How does your personality type adjust to new information? Critical thinking? Paradigm shifts? Devils advocate arguments? I'm just not sure of the best way to present new information or if I should be mentioning it instead of possibly letting her come to her own conclusions.

hi /r/INFJ, has been exploding/imploding for hours. though its usually standard for INTPs to suppress this type of intangible perception, the overwhelming response is not something i can ignore. i'm not really sure why I'm even posting here, but this isn't something i can share on /r/INTP with much credibility. 

to begin

one thing that should be noted: my mental state has always been rather robust. aside from a period of depression during my teenage years, ADHD, and other common complaints from INTPs are illnesses i have researched in detail. i do not suffer from the symptoms outlined in these and other disorders. as evidence here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGsFCvq0cMg) of me from march where i talk about being an INTP.

We met in college a few years back, but as we spent more time together in classes and outside of class, I started developing feelings for her. She broke up with her boyfriend, and 2 months after, I decided to tell her (stupid decision on my part), but anyway she rejected me nicely and we're still really good friends. I moved on.

We have ZERO mutual friends, so it's become this thing where we see each other 2-3 times a month and it's almost always scheduled in advance.

We don't talk daily (I like it like this), sometimes I don't. The times I do reply, the conversation lasts for HOURS. Don't get me wrong, I love our conversations but sometimes I need to sleep to wake up for work. We've talked about anything and everything. Animals, space exploration, philosophies, religion, future goals, watching movies

It's a cycle with her. We don't talk for a long time, and talk for consecutive days sending stupid stuff to each other, and then we'll go cold again with no conversation, and repeat.
