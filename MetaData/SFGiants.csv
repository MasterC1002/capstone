If you were to tell me at the beginning of the season

Melky was going to be all star MVP - then suspended for the rest of the year

That the dodgers were going to make the biggest trade in MLB history and the Giants blew them out in the west

That marco scutaro was going to finish 7th overall in NL batting average and become NLCS MVP

That the Giants would beat the Reds in the postseason after dropping the first two and winning three on the road

That the Giants  would come back from a 3-1 deficit in the NLCS and outscore their opponents they way they did in the last 3 games

That Barry Fuckin Zito would start Game 1 of the world series

That Pablo Sandoval would hit not 1

That we would have a 3-0 lead in the World Series against the best pitcher in baseball and the triple crown winner

Well if you told me all of that I would of probably told you to shut up.

This is amazing!!!!!

One more game guys

Lets Fucking Go!!!!!!!!!!!!

1358995883.0,175zr9,How i fell in love with San Francisco.,t_dip,121,10,43,"I thought I'd share my story about how profoundly the SF Giants have influenced and affected me. It might be long-winded but I promise I'll make my point :)

I'm an Australian who fell in love with and played baseball since I was 7 and followed MLB since I was old enough to know what it was. When I was 10 some family friends went to the US on a holiday and they brought me back a Boston Red Sox cap and from the day I received it I started following them passionately and proudly. This developed into a full blown obsession. I have 2 Red Sox tattoos and a room &amp; closet at home packed to the brim with Sox merch and memorabilia. I spend every waking moment checking scores

About 6 years ago, I could groom her to be a Red Sox fan and have someone to share my passion for my team with. This did not work.

In 2009 she watched her first Giants game on TV. It was a Lincecum start against Pittsburgh and she loved him and the team and the atmosphere and she decided that she'd follow them. Until that point

We made it to San Francisco with a week or so left in the season and I surprised her with seats 10 rows behind home plate for Lincecum's start against the Diamondbacks. She cried... and she loved getting to see him pitch. She didn't care that he got the L and didn't last more than a few innings. It was an irrelevant thing. Watching her excitement that night was one of the happier baseball moments I've had. For me

I'd started to find myself really caring about the Giants' results and their path to the playoffs before this and being in the city and feeling the buzz at games and hearing the M-V-P chants when Posey came up to the plate was infectious and inspiring and I was loving being a part of it

The crowning moments for me were first in a hotel room in LA as our journey wound down watching Game 5 of the NLDS and leaping up and down on the bed screaming as Posey's grand slam left the park. Secondly, back in Australia and watched all 4 World Series games from our couch. When Cabrera took that last strike, the smile on my GF's face was bigger than I'd ever seen it. Much bigger than when we'd watched them do it in 2010.

The reason I felt the need to share all this is because since I spent my time in San Francisco, passionate supporter-base. Your team and your city have brought me closer to the love of my life and helped introduce her to a game that has shaped me into who I am today. While I'll always be a Red Sox fan, the Giants will hold a special place in my heart and every year from here on out, through thick and thin, I'll hope that the Giants conquer the NL and the MLB, if we don't beat them to the punch.",,,1num,

so

1. the search bar is up in the header
2. the submit link is up in the header -- right below it
3. the rules are not fewer

overall

THAT SAID, if you're seeing an issue LOOK HERE AND SEE IF ANYONE HAS SEEN IT ALSO -- and add any details you can. if you can upload a screenshhot of the problem to imgur.com that would be fantastically useful. it would also help to know if you're on Windows or Mac, what browser you're using and what version. I will try very hard to fix bugs but so far I have had no CSS helpers step forward so my plate's pretty full...

hope you like the new design. we have some more ideas in the hopper.

oh

thanks to Jack for putting together our bitching new FAQ (link is in the ""rules of conduct"" area of the sidebar) and to all the help from the mod team. also

I think that covers it.


EDIT: let's post bugs here -- just please try to tack on your info to the already reported bug. thanks!

EDIT #2: thanks to everyone who has responded with bugs so far. hopefully the big ones have been crushed for all of you -- but keep them coming. I'll do my best to respond in a timely manner. I've also gotten some great constructive criticism... more on that later. but feel free to chime in on any thoughts like that here.

An additional idea created by the mod team was perhaps we do our own IAMAs if anyone is interested in hearing us talk about ourselves.

The voting/submission process for the /r/sfg awards will most likely come in the next monthish. 

IAMAs will be done whenever if people want us to do them.

You are getting my favorite baseball player ever. I'm still trying to gather my thoughts here. We've been expecting this trade all year but it's still a shock. Quite frankly

He's the 2nd best position player the Mets have ever had, walk a ton, play incredible defense to boot (he can still play center, right-field has been a joke for him all year) but most importantly, get the big fucking hit. His career with the Mets has been viewed in a really ridiculous way - the final out of the 2006 NLCS. What idiot Met fans wont tell you is that he should have won MVP that year (at the very least 2nd to Pujols) and was far and above the best player for the Mets. 

I will be rooting for you guys more than I have ever rooted for another team. As long as you have Carlos

The entire broadcast was a love-fest and sob story about the Phillies travails/injuries of the 2012 season.

TOP EDIT: [Meetup this Friday](http://www.reddit.com/r/SFGiants/comments/vpuo1/have_a_beer_with_us_rsfgiants_this_friday/)

So it’s been a few days since my last update. It’s not because I’ve gone into hiding or anything like that, update on the Monday Giants vs Dodgers game!



So, where to sit and what to eat and drink. I’d like you to know that I considered everything you guys suggested - and I think what I ended up with was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!



I was really looking forward to the game, if anyone is wondering). The game was everything I could think about, I read about baseball up front, I tried to figure out what game to go to on my own - but ended up getting a greater understanding from you guys than anything I could find online - I asked around first thing when I arrived at the airport. I did as much as I possibly could to further enhance my experience.



Being a tourist I went to Pier 39, a glove and a few balls too.



Also



Anyway - game night is here. I met up wit sfbayareagirl - who was nice enough to join me for the game - just outside of the Willie Mays gate. I was there just after 5:30, got a Norwegian priced beer from the open bar behind the bleachers, got my garlic fries and was feeling psyched for the game.



Cap on



I was on section 127, feel the mood climbing amongst the still emerging crowds and talking to everyone around me. The way americans are to complete strangers is very different from what I’m used to from Norway. We’re a very quiet and isolated people - we don’t usually talk to people we don’t know, we rarely cheer and it’s completely frowned upon to shout at games. You guys would hate going to a soccer game in Norway ;-)



After the warmup, is completely different from what you see from the seat anyway.



I was surprised by the amount of balls that ended up in the audience - and one ball landed between 127 and 128 at my row. Sadly, he gave the ball to some kid - which is very commendable. The thing he didn’t consider, though, was that the Dodgers-fan sitting two seats away from me wanted the ball. Badly. He ended up buying the ball from the kid for $100... Bet the guy that got the ball felt like crap about that one. This episode didn’t exactly make me feel bad about being a Born Again Giants Fan(tm) and not a neutral or Dodgers fan. (the same Dodgers fan that bombed the old dude doing the silly dance on the big screen by the way)



You all know how the game ended, let’s just say that I felt like one of you guys at that moment. I can easily relate to that on so many levels.



The game was incredibly exciting for me



Coming back to the hotel and reading all the comments and reliving the game again was great.



The day after I was at a pre-party for the conference, I got to see the game from Public House instead, and that in itself was an experience I will cherish. After the game I placed myself behind the outside ad-hoc TV studio, cheering and shouting BEAT LA as loud as I could. So if anyone of you watched the post game broadcast, you probably saw me there without knowing.



I’d like to extend my biggest gratitude to you guys. You’ve taken me under your wing and made me feel like one of you. Seeing all the crazy variations of my “doing it right”-post has been a blast. I’ve sent the screenshots to my family in Norway and they’ve probably had their share of laughs about it too :-)



I was going to the game to experience something American, beating their biggest rivals, the sense of community at /r/sfgiants - and most importantly - I became a fan. 



I’m here till July 3rd, after 6pm on Saturday, all of Sunday and all of Monday. I’d love to meet some of you guys, and I hope that I can continue being a part of /r/sfgiants. I can be reached at 415-702-5790.



THANK YOU!!

I am sorely disappointed in last night's Gameday Thread. There was overwhelming negativity about the team, I know how frustrating it is to be here as do all Giants fans who have followed the team for more than the past 3 years. June Swoon SUCKS. It does. But that is no excuse to attack players like Crawford who have played their career best up to this point and who only played tonight because Arias got hurt. So what about someone who hasn't played up to snuff like Kontos? Think about our bullpen options right now. Casilla hurt, Romo being kept alive for the potential save, Dunning and Rosario untested arms, Lopez needed for a tough LH out, Gaudin a starter (and hurt), and Kontos just called up from the minors with something to prove. You really think there was a better option for Bochy to use? That is why Kontos is on the team right now, Aubrey Huff, a huge part of being a Giants fan is SUPPORTING THE TEAM! Yes, and it took a rookie hitting .448 to carry the trolley dodgers to an 8th inning victory. That's still a tough loss

2. We're not watch the San Francisco Giants. Last night we saw the Dodgers beat Mike Kickham. Then we saw Jake Dunning throw a pick-off into right field with the Stephen Fife at the plate. Then we saw Juan Perez fail to get a bunt down with runners on 1st &amp; 2nd with no outs. Again

1369422619.0,1ezkoj,How To Get Great Seats and How To Get an Autograph,aardvarkarmorer,66,5,19,"So you want nice seats?

I’m going to tell you how to get great seats to a Giants game for cheap.  Cheap in this context means $50-$75 per seat for something in field club or premium field club. That’s not chump change, quick and a little bit adventurous.

The single most important thing for getting a good price on tickets is picking the right day. That means a good day of the week, then Monday, then Wednesday day games and Thursday night games are pretty close. The team they’re playing is important too. Division teams (except the Dodgers of course) are the best. You’re going to pay a premium for the A’s, Yankees, Red Sox and other super popular teams. Doesn’t mean it’s impossible, I’ve seen great deals even against the Phillies. So, look at the Giants schedule and pick a day that’s not a major holiday and not against one of those teams.

Next, you have to keep in mind that their map is not an exact representation. What I like to do is look at their map and this picture: http://anotherheader.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/dsc_9797.jpg to get a true representation.

A little about different seats: Field Club and Premium Field Club are the same thing. Premium Field Club is just anything row E or closer. There’s no barrier or anything. So a row F seat can be a great deal since it will show up as just regular field club.

The Lexus Dugout Club are the front row seats, I think they’re too low and wouldn’t spend the money on them unless they were 115 (which is higher) or 119 row AAA (right next to the on deck circle). The “Batter’s Box” is just the center section of 115 and is usually sold as a group.

Row AA seats anywhere are going to be freaking amazing. They’re usually their own tiny private row. 121 and 122 have a great view near the dugout and are unobstructed by the net.

I don’t have as much to say about Club Level except I think it’s great. It’s got a great view and great amenities. You can also save a good amount if you don’t get caught in the “right behind home plate” mentality. I like being between home and first on Club Level.

Ok, it’s too slow. Pick one type of ticket that you’re interested in (Premium Field Club, Field Club and Club Level) and sort by price. Right now, you’re just trying to get a base line. But, if you see something amazing, go ahead and get it. You should know what all the symbols next to a ticket mean. The ones you’re looking for are isle and parking pass. If you need a parking pass, getting it with your tickets can be a great deal. They’re $35 from the Giants.

There are four times to look for tickets for a 7:15pm game: anytime the day before, and 90 to 30 minutes before the game. That might sound like I’m just listing the whole day, but you’ll see tickets come in “waves”. A lot of people list them around lunch when they realize they can’t go. The 90 to 30 range is where you’ll find the best deals. I once saw 4 tickets in PFC 121 for $35 each. It’s rare for anything to come up closer than 30 minutes, though.

To give you an idea on price

If you buy your tickets last minute

The other option is Craiglist. For that

How do you find the tickets on Craigslist? I have bookmarks for a bunch of searches in a folder in Chrome. I middle click and they all open as new tabs. I search for Giants AA, AAA, BBB, CCC and Field Club. Those are all the nicest rows. It takes me less than a minute to look over everything. A lot people try to overcharge on CL and you can usually find a better deal on Stub Hub. But all you need is that one listing. That’s how I got my last tickets.

That’s basically it. The single best thing to do is practice once. Pick a day that you’re not going,False,,t5_2s5xr,False,,2nums,t3_1ezkoj
