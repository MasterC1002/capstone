Anyways, and mixed in some little things from the newer design, and thanks to the revised code I was able to add stuff I wasn't able to before because some things would interfere with others due to my shoddy coding.

Here's a short list of some of the stuff that *did* make it:

* Link Karma Score Color Change for better visibility

* Upvote/Downvote Buttons (Temporary)

* Self Post / Link Post Thumbnails

* All of the colors are now coordinated ex: green used in tab menu is same green in links

* Sidebar section dividers have been simplified, it'll take time.

* Neat little image change thingy when you hover over the Bravest Warriors link in the header.

* Reverted back to Reddit default font size/style

* Reverted back to Reddit default text entry field

That's all the things I can remember adding for now.

So that's that. Again

Anyways

How about Danny nipples showing though his shirt? 

And how about that strobe light party time robot?

And why does the Martian badlands have to be new Miami? Miami isn't *that* bad. I was born there

So about flair....

**FLAIR ADDED:**

* Young Danny

* Laser Party Robot

* Hans Christian Teet-Phanters

* Danny's dad/mom

* Fish President

**Emotes to be added:**

* Danny's ""juicy"" lips

* Young Danny's spiritual experence face

* Young Danny's scared face

* Young Danny barfing

1361593776.0,192c75,"Theory about the Concierge, the Emotion Lord, and time shenanigans",hiero_,26,11

We know the Concierge follows the Emotion Lord around taking notes. The Bravest Warriors wiki states that he follows the EL around taking notes of whatever he does. This is only *partially* true; he's actually taking notes on what Chris does, looking at him and his concern for Beth, and jotting down some notes before walking back through the portal with a smug look on his face. I don't know why or what his relationship with the EL truly is, perhaps there are some darker reasons at bay from the powers that be that we may not yet be aware of, and perhaps he is involved. And with the visions seen in this episode, it looks like some bad mojo is ""pre-determined"" to hit Chris someday, each piece possibly being the remaining major events that will affect him (namely whatever happens to Beth

However, the Emotion Lord immediately grew hair back. This means that in the Bravest Warriors universe, time does not branch off into separate timelines, but it is one fixed line that can be altered. Chris doesn't necessarily have to fulfill all of the events of the future; otherwise, why would the Concierge be taking notes to make sure he is completing each task?

Going off of that, entirely - thus, the Chris we know would never become the Emotion Lord. That said, the Emotion Lord and the Concierge might even be in antagonistic positions if this were to occur.

Basically


TL;DR - The Concierge and the EL are laying the seeds for Chris to become the EL, Chris may not end up becoming the EL after all (and it will probably all boil down to something like 'I didn't confess my feelings to her when I should have')

It's really crazy when you start to think about it just how contrived this show's plot is getting for a five minute long silly cartoon. Welp

EDIT: I want to take this ONE step further. Just re-watched episode two and Chris yells at the Emotion Lord ""And you're the reason Danny's going to die, I know if a ruse is a distaction when I see one. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Chew on *that*.",,False,self,t5_2tl4p,1361609198.0,cuteguy,

He wears the exact same suit as Chris. He knows the entire team's names. He know's Chris' destiny, he said he was kidding at the end, but that could be yet another lie.)  He seemed to know everything Chris was going to do, and knew EXACTLY how to push his buttons and make him become overly emotional.

And perhaps the most solid piece of evidence was when Beth said ""These scans don't make sense. Chris, meaning the Emotion Lord IS Chris.

There were at least two instances in which when Plum was slightly emotional around the warriors that they would lose their memory for a few seconds before gaining it back. At one point, and no one ever seems to talk about it.

It's also plausible that whoever is her second brain is/was a memory donk.

I was browsing Reddit when [this](http://www.reddit.com/tb/18yx27) popped up (Thanks willplaykazooforfood for making my mind wander). Since AT and BW occurs in the same universe (and solar system), but I highly doubt they're in the same time.

Bravest Warriors is **at least** in the [31^st century (30XX)](http://www.reddit.com/r/BravestWarriors/comments/18gl2j/tomorrow_is_wallows_birthday/). When does AT occur?

I also have seen some debate on what occurs first

A.) Adventure Time is set in the future (after Bravest Warriors) and refuses to use the advanced technology (besides the mind-powered teleportation device)

B.) Bravest Warriors is set in the future (after Adventure Time), and even build time machines

C.) They could be in parallel universes (M-Theory/Multiverse Theory)

D.) Chris could have had a flash-back for that one split second

Other than that I probably just over thought everything ^^^:(",self,t5_2tl4p,False,,bee,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/BravestWarriors/comments/18zvbg/we_need_a_discussion_about_adventure_time_bravest/

The first thing I have found is in episode 10 of Bravest Warriors. At 3:53 if you pause at the perfect timing you can see something familiar. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/qtpgi0Y) Now I believe that is a reference to this (Sorry for all the links) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/GDvjMqy) Now if you still haven't caught on I'll explain it.
The second picture I showed you is a picture of the world in Adventure Time, it is just a theory, but I'd like to think this could happen.

If you want more evidence I have one other piece. In the episode that was just released, when we live. And if you add the 1000 years of time from after the Mushroom War you get to be near the begninning of the 3000s. So if Bravest warriors and Adventure Time both take place near the same time period, and if we saw what would possibly be the Adventure Time world in a flashforward, I believe that there will be more references and maybe a small crossover to come.

TLDR; Adventure time world was seen in a flashforward in Bravest Warriors and they both take place around the same time so there is a possibility for crossovers.",self,t5_2tl4p,False,,horse,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/BravestWarriors/comments/19vnak/bravest_warriors_and_adventure_time_possible/

He's waiting for his less-cool friend to make a move. The thing is

------------------------------------------------------

Chris *thinks* he's head-over-heels for Beth. 

But if he never acts on his feelings

Chris is so stuck in his own head he can't even see Danny's feelings for her. Danny flirts with her in **ep. 8**, and dances with her in **5**.

------------------------------------------------------

Who's to say Danny doesn't care about Beth more than Chris? 

Can their affections be measured or compared?

Maybe Danny is *just as terrified* as Chris

------------------------------------------------------

It's okay though. Chris is going to realize truly loving Beth means respecting her decisions and friend-zoning himself means he has decided that she *is not allowed* to choose a boyfriend for herself. It's going to be good for him.

Personally if BW ended up just being a prequel to adventure time I would feel let down that something so awesome was just a part of some bigger more popular show. 

Also, implying that if BW is a prequel to Adventure time our beloved warriors will meet grizzly ends from some war. I don't know a lot about the Adventure time lore so I may be wrong, but still I would hate to see Bravest warriors try to become a part of something it doesnt need to. Anywhoseir, because I like to drum up conversation I would love to hear and discuss all your opinions on the matter. If I upset anyone with my dislike of adventure time, I am sorry.

TL;DR I LOVE bravest warriors as it's own stand alone thing and will be disappointed if it is tied to adventure time. Discuss",self,t5_2tl4p,False,,shuckle,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/BravestWarriors/comments/18zer3/does_anyone_else_not_want_an_adventure_time/

1363622759.0,1aj36q,I would like to file a formal complaint about the character known as 'Catbug'.,Prezombie,2,4,5,"Bugs and beetles may sometimes look similar at first glance

**Mouthparts**

Bugs: mouthparts modified into piercing stylet (i.e. needle-like).

Beetles: chewing mouthparts.

Catbug chews his food.

**Wings**

Bugs: wings (if present) are membranous or partially thickened.

Beetles: forewings modified to form hard

Catbug's wings are clearly in the latter category. 

**Diet**

Bugs: liquid diet: mostly plant-feeders (nectar/sap)

Beetles: wide range of plant and animal materials eaten.


Catbug does not subsist on liquids

**Lifecycle**

Bugs: incomplete metamorphosis - juveniles resemble adults except smaller and lack wings.

Beetles: complete metamorphosis - larvae with hardened head

Catbug's unknown origins leave this one up to debate, or at least addressing this issue, would greatly improve Entomologist relations.
