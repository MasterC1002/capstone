I'm not posting this to brag

To me

Sure, but as a father and husband I simply didn't have 80 hours a week to throw at bar exam prep. More importantly, I found that many of the assignments on the BarBri paced program were a complete waste of time for me and therefore counterproductive if they are taking away from time that could be better used.

When I searched the web I found several other study programs that seemed a little absurd as well. For example, that 75 hours would account only for reading and answering the questions, so add in another 20-30 hours reviewing the answers. This seemed like major overkill on practice questions to me as well.

That said

Here's what I did:

- I studied for approximately 40 hours a week. For the most part I took the weekends off. When I did study on the weekends it was brief... maybe an hour or two or a set of multiple choice questions, I treated bar prep as a full time job with no overtime. I didn't take any weekdays off.
 
- I studied for 9 weeks

- During the first month of BarBri when you are scheduled to receive lectures I would watch the lecture every morning. One way to make them go faster is to download the lectures and play them at 1.5x speed. You miss nothing from the class and can save an hour+ a day this way. There's other places online where you can find info on this.

- During the lectures I would fill out the lecture notes. I think this is important for keeping you focused and understanding how the rules fit together.

- Every afternoon I would spend about 3-4 hours making flash cards from the morning's lecture. Simply put, but this was the place where I learned the rules. I found after completing this process daily that the material was 70-80% in my head and understood. Regarding flashcards... It's important to note that flashcards were always the best memory device for me in law school. I rarely made an effective outline for any law school class... usually I would try and get an outline from someone else and make cards from those... However, if you are an outline maker you may rather use these 3-4 hours a day making an outline and reviewing it... Some people like to make little condensed outlines that put the rules on a few pages. If that works for you, I recommend you use your time to do that. The important thing is that you do something to process the information and learn it rather than assume you learned it because you sat through the lecture. This was a major complaint I had with the BarBri program. If you follow their schedule they would tell you watch the lecture, review quickly then just take a bunch of practice questions. It never made sense to me- why should I be writing out answers to essay questions if I haven't learned the law first? To me, taking the time to process the information is the key to success on the bar, and is far more important than knocking out practice questions to hit some arbitrary number.

- After completing notecards, jot out an outline of what I thought the answer would be, and then read the model answer to check to see how I did vs. the model.

- In the last few weeks of BarBri the lectures end. When there were no more lectures I would sit down and go through flash cards

- The only exceptions to the above study schedule were when I took the major exams offered in BarBri

- All told, doing practice exams is all about getting used to the timing. Once you have timing there isn't much value in practicing when you could be learning the law.

- All told, and the 100 question BarBri Final. I only used BarBri questions and no other questions to supplement (PMBR, purchasing released questions, etc.)

- I only completed 2 full MPTs before the exam. Since I had some concern about the MPT

- I did not complete the BarBri AMP modules. I tried to at first

- The bar exam started on a Tuesday. I didn't do a great deal of review after the preceding Friday. I did a little bit on the last weekend but by then I knew everything

- I did not use my Conviser mini review or large course outline books at all. The only books I used were the completed lecture handout sheets

So that is what worked for me. Boiling all of this down

- Do your best to learn every rule covered in the lectures

- Even trying your best to memorize just material in the lecture notes

- Take practice tests

One final caveat-
Don't sweat the BarBri Scores, so seeing myself drop closer to average in the BarBri scores was a shot to my confidence: Why was I scoring comparatively worse than I was before? Anyways, A few days later, without any additional studying I did just fine on the MBE as you can see above.

I know we are all stressed out law students facing imposing debt and bleak job prospects.  We are also generally people, and I hope it brightens everyone's day.

I am currently working in an immigration law clinical program at my law school. We represent low-income immigrants facing deportation proceedings.  This is sometimes asylum proceedings, however, was a legal permanent resident guilty of accidentally taking his wife's prescription pain medication because he hurt his shoulder in a work related injury.  He was on probation for drunk driving at the time, and failed a mandatory drug test.  He never had taken drugs in his life (other than alcohol) prior to this, and is a loving husband and father to his 7 year old daughter.

I argued his case before an immigration judge last week.  I have never argued a case in court before, and even his two little terrier dogs.  They all came to the trial (except for the dogs) and looked just as scared as I was when I walked into the courtroom.

Long story short, and we won the case.  Our client is free.  He's back home with his family tonight.  This is the best thing I've ever done in my life, and I feel so much better about myself now than I have since I started law school.  The moral of the story is that while I have grown pretty cynical about law school and the legal profession, we can and will make a difference in peoples' lives by virtue of what we do as lawyers in the future!

About me, and I have received about a half dozen unsolicited job offers this year.  So I'm an average student, with above average job prospects. 

**Things I did wrong (the longer list):** 

* Slept with law students. Every time I have done this it's blown up in my face.  One of these accidents I anticipate running into for the rest of my career. Needless to say

* It took me awhile to figure out how to study.  Like many law students I breezed through undergrad without having to study.  Learning how to study is something I'm still refining, techno and push ups seem to help me.  I typically hate these things.  Also, non-crunchy library snacks and headphones.  

* pre-1L stressing out.  I spent a few months trying to prep for 1L

* I didn't get a solid exercise routine down before school started.  Let's call it the 1L 12lbs.  But my fitness suffered 1L

* Same goes with high speed cooking. Sometimes I would just get super busy and start eating out.  This didn't really save time, and be able to cook them quickly (rice cooker, slow cooker, and microwave are your friends). 

* I lost touch with a lot of my friends.  I would get so stressed out that I wouldn't hang out with my friends

* I didn't buy enough nice clothes.  I've found myself under-dressed on a number of occasions


**Things I did right (I think)**

* Kept booze at my house.  Not only did I need it on more than a few occasions

* Worked my ass off in classes.  I briefed every case, but it helped me.  

* Worked my ass off outside of classes.  I did a ton of volunteering outside of the school with legal organizations my 1L year.  It adds a lot of stress to the school week

* I was focused on the type of law I wanted to do before school started.  When attorneys asked me what I wanted to do I had a short and direct answer for them.  This allowed me to start networking in the field I want to work in

* I'm good at faking confidence, and so will their rivals.  Look confident without looking cocky. 

* I lost touch with my friends (This was in the things I did wrong column too).  I put 100% of my energy into my 1L year

* I didn't spend to much time on this subreddit.  This subreddit is filled with half awesome advice, and not having an in with biglaw.  If what I just described works for you, fantastic, but it sure doesn't work for me.  Maybe I closed myself off from the truth, but staying positive was important for me my first year, and not going onto this subreddit helped (I prefer lurking on /r/funny).  

If you're already committed to law school it's time to stop stressing.  You'll do fine.  Just try and identify the class idiot to make sure it's not you.  

EDIT: I almost forgot to say how much I fucking love law school.  Yeah 1L takes a toll on your sanity, but it feels awesome to be on a track to doing exactly what you want to do.  As the bumper sticker says, the difference between ordeal and adventure is ATTITUDE!

My father and his best friend would rape me repeatedly.  

I grew up decently, jail, etc.  You name the situation and I've likely been in it.  I've dealt with everything from substance addictions to sex addictions.  No joke.  

My mother always thought she failed me.  My mother always had some idea of what I might have gone through when she caught me ""fucking"" my teddy bear as a child, the most shaping experience of my life; whether I was conscious of it or not.  

Nobody else in this world will give me props.  I just wanted to come somewhere and declare that I am an individual who has survived horrible things that, but I am still here.  I am not only here, but I am on top of my proverbial game.  On top of everyone's game.  I managed to beat the odds.  I am not in porn.  I am not a stripper.

You are in for a very hard fight. You have to give yourself every advantage you can. Network with members of the bar as much as you can, you're hurting your odds of making it. Also, you'll need to dick around a little in class and spend some time drinking and chasing tail just to stay sane, but you know, try to keep these things in check.

But here's the real advice that I wish I'd gotten: You can do everything right, network, charm your professors, everything, and still fail. There's about 45,000 law grads and 25,000 law jobs,000-25

And even if you don't do everything right you're not necessarily a bad person. It's a fucked up world that says if you didn't give 110% then you deserve any bad thing that happens. We're people,* not three years of Adderall-fueled inhuman cram sessions.

I see so many questions on how to go through the law job process. I thought I can provide some insight from someone who went through the exact process and who has been involved in hiring side too.

_So What Should You Be Doing_.

Critically review your Resume and Cover Letter. I mean _really_ review and ask yourself: is my resume and cover letter giving the hiring manager and HR rep the _right_ information to make an informed decision? If your resume is not drafted to fit the job listing or description it is useless to the hiring manager. You need to ""seed"" your resume with the ""code words"" and ""tags"" that are in the job description. You should have at least 4-5 different resumes emphasizing different areas and strengths to meet the requirements of the job. If you are using a generic resume you are not helping the hiring manager make a decision. A generic resume is bound for the trash bin because they are inundated with resumes. Also

In addition

Networking. You should network, print out a set of business cards with all of your contact information to give to people that can make a difference. I love it when candidates have their own cards because I have it _right_ there and don't need to fuss with writing information down. I can organize it immediately at my office. Just put a title down as ""juris doctorate"" or ""juris doctorate candidate"". Whatever. It's the contact information you need to convey. The people you meet will have an impact. The regional bars are a small group. 

Differentiate yourself. Think very critically on what makes you different from all the other candidates. What's your background? What's your undergraduate degree. What practical business or industry experience to you have? The more differences and practical skills you can list it makes you stand out. If you have coding experience put it down. If you have specialized application experience

Get any temp/contract job you can. Even at the temp contract legal firms

I can go on and on but I think I wrote too long anyway. I will be checking in to anwer questions as they come.

2. Did you know about its reputation before your decision to attend?

3. What is your current attitude towards the school? Do you regret attending it?

4. What's the general attitude of the student body towards the school? Are they aware of what other people think of the school? Are they aware of their job prospects? 

5. What do you think of Cooley calling itself the second best law school in the nation?

6. What are the professors like? How do they feel about Cooley's reputation?

&gt;Dear students
&gt;
For more than 90 years, adding and enhancing practical training opportunities and modifying the curriculum to prepare students to meet the challenges of today’s world.
&gt; 
The Law School works every day to ensure that our students are primed to succeed in the current job market. We have decided that reducing our 1L class size by approximately 10 percent over the next three years will help achieve this goal. Reducing class size will allow the Law School to deliver to every student the practical skills training and personalized approach that have become cornerstones of the curriculum. Simply put
&gt; 
A reduction in 1L class size requires a corresponding adjustment to our long-term budget strategy. Now, developing new revenue and possibly even devoting more resources to certain areas to advance the academic and strategic goals of the Law School.
&gt; 
All of this work depends on input from you: our students, process or practice you think could be improved, now is your chance to effect that change. Suggestions may be provided in several ways:
&gt; 
&gt;·         Website submission form at https://my.lls.edu/innovation (LLS IDM credentials required for log in)
&gt;
·         Direct email submission to members of the Innovation Task Force Working Group (listed at https://my.lls.edu/innovation)
&gt;
&gt;·         Informational meetings with open comment periods later this spring semester

**Deciding to go to law school:**

Going to law school is a poor choice for the majority of people who attend or are thinking about attending. That being said, then you should know that these are generally very crappy reasons. What kind of law do you want to do? If you want to work at a big law firm I would say you shouldn’t go anywhere outside the T14, and even then you should know that there is a very good chance you won’t get a biglaw job. I love my school, and I think it’s a very good school by a lot of measures, but I also know that probably 85% of the people who wanted a big law job (which is a lot of people at my school) didn’t get a summer associate position for the summer. 

 I’m also of the opinion that anything ranked lower than the T25 or so is (almost) never worth paying full price for, schools, law firms, class rank, etc. This is a very shitty, but real part of the profession. 
If you can

**Summer before law school:**

Don’t do a damn thing to prepare. Don’t even think about it. Relax, work out, get your life in order. 

**So you’re a 1L:**

The best advice I can give you is this: find out what method of learning and studying works for you and do it. Don’t think that because something worked for me or someone else that it will work for you. With that said

Read every page assigned and go to every class. Pay very close attention. Read slowly and carefully, and don’t play the “I don’t really get this, but I’ll figure it out later” game. I read the assignments for class the day before they are covered in the class, and I generally spend a lot of time on the reading (maybe ~1.5 hours per 10 pages depending on how dense the reading is). Take notes on what you read. Look for what rules are coming out of the case and how the facts of the case played into the rule. Other than doing the assigned reading I didn’t do any other review or studying until finals time.

 Don’t go on facebook in class, and I take notes by hand. I think taking notes by hand has several benefits: it’s less distracting, you have to think more and distill things before you write, and it means you have to read everything again when you go to outline later. 

Remember that you aren’t learning the law as much as you are learning your professor’s version of the law. For this reason

**Outlining and exams:** 

I start outlining about 2 weeks before each exam. I go through and type up my hand written notes and organize them a bit. This outline is generally 70-100 pages long. I then go back through and try to make a condensed outline that is under 15 pages

After your outline is done

Reread your outlines several times. Prepare for every exam like it is a closed book exam. 

The traditional law school exam will give you a narrative that is maybe 3-10 pages long, but is about viewing the narrative given from different angles and saying which angle will lead to the most likely outcome. 

**Finding a 1L summer job:**

Early in the year, and invest a lot of time in the process. Finding a 1Lsummer job was probably the worst part about the first year.

**Transferring schools:**

After my 1L year I thought about transferring

**The writing competition:**

Take 1 day off after your finals are over, it helps to more or less read the bluebook. The writing competition is about attention to detail, and it’s likely that it will force you to use some of the most obscure and minute bluebook rules. 

**OCI:**

Again, above the law career center/lateral link, the firm’s website, and NALP. Know the basics of the firm and make of list of three things you like about the firm, the more specific to the particular firm the better. These things shouldn’t be general like: “I like that you work with big name clients/Bank of America/etc,”(most big corporations work with a ton of different law firms at once) or “I like that your firm gives a lot of responsibility to new associates”(all firms say this). 

Look up your interviewer and note anything particularly interesting about him/her or anything you might have in common with him/her. Overall
If anyone has any questions about any of this I will be happy to answer.

Personally, and even though that has nothing to do with the kind of law I'm building my career around (Criminal), its still fascinating and interesting.

**I'm a 1L
 
***Classes:***

Everyone knows that your 1L grades are far and away the best way of landing a gig.  The question here is really

The best way to figure this out is looking through the eyes of a law professor.  Think about their circumstances.  Law professors are expected to research

All the while, tear-soaked essays.  Just like most everyone else in the legal community, they do not have a lot of time to work with, and they want to do their job as quickly as possible while covering their responsibilities (read: butts).  

As for those responsibilities, how do you go about ranking 200 essay exams?  You have to employ some kind of metric.  That metric winds up involving some sort of point system.  

Against this backdrop

1) identify issues (points); 

2) accurately state the law (points); 

3) apply the law (points);

 4) apply the law differently (points); 

5) make an overall assessment (points).  

Let's break this down further.

1) identify issues:  The act of communicating a spotted issue should net you at least one point.  However

2) accurately state the law:  This should be the easiest class of points to get.  Make sure you can concisely, brainless memorization.  

3) apply the law:  You have to demonstrate that you actually understand the nuances of the applicable rule of law

4) apply the law differently:  This embodies the Getting to Maybe branches.  You need to make all reasonable alternative arguments, Billy gets two points while you only get one.  

5) make an overall assessment:  Pick your favorite application of law discussed.  The actual choice matters very little.  You just have to make one.  

So now you know what the goals are.  As for the plan for execution, what you should do is keep tasks 1-5 in mind, and figure out how to develop your ability to execute these five tasks efficiently and effectively.  If you don't think your study plan is helping you improve on these five tasks, change it up.  Presumably, you're smart, and you can figure this out.  


***Networking:***

If you haven't heard people talk about the importance of networking

I'm assuming you've heard stories about how some job posting was up for all of a day and the employer was flooded with 200

As an analogy, your moot court partner John tells you that his pal Billy, despite getting a higher grade in torts than him, is a good guy who's looking for a place. John says that he lived with Billy a while back, and Billy is respectful, responsible, will clean your bathrooms, and stock the fridge both with food and beer before you even think about asking.  What are you going to do first

Think about this further--what if you call up Billy, what if you go ahead and have Billy sign a lease and he trashes your house?  These events reflect poorly not only on Billy, but on John as well.  

This is obviously obvious

How this immediately relates to you is, and your summer employers are generally really well connected.  You're networking on day 1 of class, each time you get called on, and each visit to a professor's office hours.  You want to present yourself well because these people are potentially able to recommend you to people who can do something about your employment situation.  You don't want them to wonder if you're going to sully their reputation to the recommendee.  

However, know-it-all gunner.  In my limited experience, professors are much more receptive to students who are just genuinely interested in learning from them.  Think about it--by expressing interest in that professor's field of expertise, you're essentially feeding their ego.  Not in a bad way--people enjoy feeling knowledgeable and that their life's work is interesting.  

How this is relates to you in the medium to long term is, and coworkers will eventually be in a position to recommend you to potential clients, employers and opportunities.  You want to be known and remembered as the capable, personable, professional guy/gal that so-and-so went to school/worked with.

1) Make business cards for yourself. Vistaprint makes like 1000 for five bucks. 

2) Attend every single event your school has that you have even a slight interest in. Stay after

3) Offer to help set up these events! Two of my job offers came from people I originally met by scheduling them to speak at my school. 

4) Make an excel sheet numbered 1-100. Go to your school, and find some attorneys in the current field you are interested in. Email every single one of them. Every one. Simply ask if you can buy them a cup of coffee and pick their brain. Of the 50 or so times I did this, only 3 said no. 2 never got back. It works. 

At these small interviews, ask them for a referral of others you should speak with. 

Full that excel sheet 1-100. I promise you'll find something promising before 50, I have ZERO money, and I'm not a minority of any kind. I did this on my own. This works. 

Do it. Many here will say

Screw them. This actually DOES create jobs. One of my offers was a new position the CEO had been wanting to add and he felt I'd be good for it. Even if it doesn't for you

I don't have great grades, and just sort of gravitated toward it from the beginning. So both of my summers were in local government law offices (City Attorney/DA sort of thing). I also have a part-time job with the DOT in my city. So I have a fair amount of experience, but it's all in city government in one localized area of the country. I didn't do OCI--I never wanted to do biglaw and I didn't have the grades for most of the firms coming to my school anyway. That's a decision I still do not regret.

I really hoped that the job market would open up a bit more by the time I graduated, and they'll pull their CAs from there. Every local government office around here is in a similar situation. The ones who are hiring have the pick of the litter and apparently I ain't it. I got a snazzy opportunity with a DA's office in the next county over, but at the second interview they told me there were over eighty candidates for the position. How the fuck do I compete with that?

I'm just feeling utterly hopeless. I paid sticker to go to my school because I thought the rank would help my job prospects. Now I'm almost $200k in debt and even with what I think are reasonable goals (local yokel government jobs...), I'd be removing myself from the legal networking pool and my chances would only diminish further.

The one thing that has kept me going is that I know I love being an attorney. I've never been happier than the summers when I was actually doing real work with these local offices. But at this point I don't know how to make that career happen when I graduate. I really

Law School Transparency, personalized approach, especially when it comes to financial data.

Rather than sitting around theorycrafting about what y'all would find useful, some ideas are more feasible than others, but we're still largely in the brainstorming phase, so maybe your wacky idea will lead to something more productive.

Also, that's about how much we *do* have. We're thinking about doing a KickStarter for the new batch of updates. What do y'all think about that? Is that a service you'd be willing to contribute through? And, what if any incentives would you like to see offered? Physical things like a t-shirt or coffee mug would obviously start to dig in to our funds pretty quick. But, this isn't like producing a music album where we can offer a copy for free to donors. Actually, it is like that, except we're going to keep LST free for everyone, so it's not much of an incentive.

I got accepted to Oklahoma City University Law. With my scholarship, but I just did not perform well enough on my LSAT this time.

Here's what scares me about going to OCU: geting a fair to middlin' law job, and hate it for the same reasons, but also have around $80K in debt that I don't have now. 

Here's why I wanted to go to law school: not to be rich, you're so much more likely to succeed and be satisfied.

I don't like my accounting job (not real accounting like CPA or Tax, the pressure and stress are nearly constant. I spend long hours in a cubicle crunching numbers and doing extremely tedious and repetitive work, and it is crushing my soul. From what I'm reading around the web, that doesn't sound too far off from what the typical lawyer does. 

Maybe I ought to just look at a career change before plunging into the lake of debt that is law school.

I read the FAQ, I'm desperate for some insight, and my brain is raw from mulling it over for a few weeks now.",,False,self,t5_2rb9g,,http://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1cvlmk/in_at_a_34_tier_school_starting_to_think_it_might/

Below is Dean Gold's message to students:


&gt;Dear students:
 
&gt;U.S. News &amp; World Report has released its newest law school rankings. The 2014 list places us at No. 68 overall out of more than 190 law schools. The Law School’s Evening Division Program was ranked No. 6 out of 82 part-time programs
 
&gt;Our drop from No. 51 is a big disappointment – especially on the heels of three straight years of rising in the rankings. In the latest rankings
 
&gt;All of this underscores the fact that the law school must work harder for its students and grads. We will devote additional resources to career services for current students and to programs aimed at assisting recent graduates get jobs.  As announced earlier this month, clinics and practica, Loyola now provides students with the opportunity to put knowledge into practice in a huge variety of real-world contexts.
 
&gt;We will do a careful study of the new ranking methodology and work to improve. For a perspective on Loyola’s U.S. News ranking over the last decade or so

I entered law school full of bluster and gumption

What I didn't realize was that the students who lack native legal reasoning skills attempt to make up for this deficit by increasing their participation

I'm so tired of all of the off-the-wall hypos and questions from people who obviously didn't do the reading that I keep my hand down in the hopes that we can move along more quickly to a productive area of discussion.

My law school has come down hard on the professors to be ""nicer"" and avoid being the stereotypical hard-assed law prof.  What that has translated to so far is that the professors are less likely to shut down the useless comments.  I'm hoping they start to reign in the serial offenders as the weeks go on because many studious people like myself just give up trying to get questions answered in class and head to the T.A. afterward if something isn't too clear.

This isn't the time to take your foot off the gas. Put it this way: Failing the bar exam is a terrible feeling, ""What if I had done more, and then waiting another 2/3 months for results. Do it right the first time

* *Dress for winter* I can't speak for other testing centers, including a jacket. Point is, don't dress for July weather. You can always take layers off if your center is at a comfortable temp, but if you walk in with shorts and a T-shirt, and you're wrong, you're done. For context, I love it to be freezing, and I was *shivering* in that room.

* *Take whatever time you were planning on leaving for the testing center and leave 45+ minutes earlier than that.*
I had a 10 minute drive to the testing center, and that wasn't the end of it. There was ONE parking lot cashier working that morning! Point is, you don't know what it's gonna be like that morning. I planned for traffic into the testing center, but it was 10x worse than I expected. Maybe there's a wreck on the highway that morning, or some unexpected construction (on that note, it might not be a bad idea to drive by the center the day before to check). Getting there by the seat of your pants will only add to your anxiety. Leave yourself some time to get seated, acclimated

* *Study smart
Many instructors in my bar review course (Kaplan) said that the bar examiners were cognizant of antiquated areas of law, because, well, it's worthless. Conversely, they were putting more emphasis on topics such as mortgages, given its practical nature. There were a ton of mortgage questions on the MBE. Maybe that happens again, maybe it doesn't, but don't spend much time on it either. If it's on there

First - thanks to the new mods of the hypobank. You guys have been really on the ball with adding people.  

Our AMA series is doing really well.  We've had some really excellent attorneys come and do AMAs

Thank you to EVERYONE who worked on the FAQ.  It's now using the new wiki page and we can easily approve new editors if anyone wants to clean it up or add sections for the upper division students.  

---

**On that note - 0Ls - please read the FAQ.**  The community wrote it specifically with you in mind.  Bl1y was kind enough to have us use his team's research for job prospects around the country which is sourced from NALP data

---

**One more new subreddit rule:** (we only have one other hard and fast rule in the sidebar) if a 0L asks a question about law school, and unhelpful.  Please, just point them to the FAQ.  

If you give someone a legitimate answer and they get combative

---

**A note about memes.**

I know memes can be fun, scumbag scalia writes a lot of mean dissenting opinions.  Yes, undergrads are annoying.  Yes, you don't do all the reading and you have no job. 

Memes aren't banned or anything like that


---

**New Community Project**

* I'd like to take advantage of the new wiki system.  Initially when I wanted to launch the outline bank I wanted to have a wiki people could edit into 'reddit commercial outlines'. It would be easy to keep updated with regular editors/ people sifting through it BUT there weren't enough people here (at the time there were maybe 5 posts/ day).  

Now we have a lot more traffic and after the success of the FAQ

After the basic outline is up

The new wiki system is very intuitive.  The table of contents creates itself using hash tags from headlines 1 (#) to headline 6(######).  (i.e. #this would be headline 1.  ##This would be headline two).  The CSS is already in place to make the headlines different colors

* Bl1y suggested we have a 'reddit journal' for people who want to post their publications



I think that's it.  We're also open to feedback. If you think something is awful - let us know.  If you report something - please send a message saying why it's reported.  If you want to do something fun with the traffic here

Again - thank you guys for making this place what it is.  It's come a LONG way from it's tiny beginning a couple years ago.

I figured after all my practice I should take a course just to be sure so I took the blueprint course.  I walked in thinking that I was going to score high.  The logic games crushed me. I barely finished the first question. It was like all of a sudden I was looking at something I had never seen before. 
I had no other plans besides law school. My undergrad was polsci and prelaw. I have a 3.9 GPA but this score crushes my chance of getting into a top school. I figure if I go to a school like Florida coastal I will find it hard to get a job after.  My life is spiraling.

0Ls:
While I commend you for your unbridled enthusiasm for wanting to get ahead

1. What should I read to prepare for law school?

	Anything but law. Seriously get caught up on all those books you want to read

2. Is there anything I can do to better prepare for law school?

	Yes. 

a.) Think REALLY hard about why you are there. Honestly the economy is SATURATED with law school grads right now with minimal jobs available. Do you really want to take on 80, but as a 3L with many friends long since graduated and still working for free, I would reconsider your career choice, or at least your timing. 

b.) Spend time with your family and friends. Because during the first year you will not be able to. Make sure your significant other knows that they will not be your #1 priority for at least the next year and you will be busy as hell for the 2 after. I saw many many a relationship fail during the first year...second year and in third year they are still dropping like flies. So be prepared for that. This is not coming from bitterness

Some tips for 1Ls that I wish someone told me:

1. Don’t get wrapped up in all the stress. Worry about yourself

2. Don’t talk about how much you studied or what obscure issue you spotted on that exam. Actually, no one cares. Write it on the top of your word document if it makes you feel better. 

These are the main things i think people fall into. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to act.  I will answer with brutal honesty based on my own opinion. This might be downvoted into oblivion,False,self,t5_2rb9g,False,,Default,t3_m0pg5

I'm not from the US but I recently just finished my undergraduate on Communication (specializing in advertising and public relations) last March. I was accepted in the top law school of my country for a Juris Doctor degree and am currently into our 2nd/3rd week.

I wasn't sure what else I would do after graduation so when I found out that I passed exams I didn't bother studying for, paid attention as if it was something I had always wanted to do. 

Except now

The thing is, and father were all lawyers. They and the rest of my family encouraged me to take it because they believed that I would be good at it. I have no problem with going through the codals or comprehension of the cases.

But I have no motivation to stick around. Not personally

I'm not a fan of the constant stress, of course). I never fancied working in a law firm, or hacking it out at a court, or becoming a judge/justice, or becoming a politician (where any form of formal education isn't even required). 

Everyone I'm asking now is telling me to stay. Every single member of my family is telling me that I'll regret quitting.

And that's part of why I'm hesitating. I don't want to disappoint them. The first thing my grandfather said when he found out I passed was: ""Thank God

My friends are telling me to get out. To find out what I really want to do and do it. Even if it means a job that isn't quite as grand as that of a lawyer. Even if I'm not quite a fan of what career options are immediately available to my undergraduate course.

There's more risk in getting out now. But I think I'll be happier. I think. (Would I regret it? And think: ""what if I had stayed?"")

I don't know.

0L Prep
Don't do it. If you insist on doing something
Why?

1) You could be learning the material wrong! Even in supplements that were recommended by my professors, in Torts, my professor used the RST 3d approach to proximate cause, which is completely different from the way you would learn it in a supplement! You shouldn't know what that means, suffice to say the variation among professors and supplements is significant enough that you should not start reading substantive material. In every single class I took, there were times when the supplement and my professor outright contradicted one another on the exact same point (hint: your professor is always right).

2) You're wasting your time! Most of the material you would spend your time going over will never be covered. Further, you might be tempted to write about it anyway for extra points. That's a mistake because no professor will give you credit for discussing material that was not in the reading or class discussions.

3) You will burn out. This is not a question of if, the sooner your enthusiasm will deplete. This will make it considerably harder to push yourself to study and learn even when you desperately need to. And in these times, you will wonder why you did not enjoy to the fullest every moment you had before coming to law school.

4) This is your last moment of freedom. You're going to be busy until next May. Really busy. Not only that, this is your last chance to take time off and hike/travel/whatever for the foreseeable future.",,False,self,t5_2rb9g,False,Default,
