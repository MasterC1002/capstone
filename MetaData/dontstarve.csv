It is a new ranged weapon

 **You are able to catch it

**Twist**: It hurts you if you can't catch it and it loses 10% more durability.

Catching the boomerang is possible by clicking it

**Twist2**: It's very difficult to click

**Solution:** As it's getting close to you, cutting down trees(only if axe is equipped) or **catching the boomerang**, thus taking no damage and preserving the boomerang's durability.

It all went pretty good. I had tons of materials
I made a campfire for the night and finally made a shovel. Suddenly my health started decreasing and I lasted with just one seed. I gotta say that it saved my life because when the morning came I didn't have any plan at all so I ran out in the wild hoping for a miracle. I went to the tombstone and desperately digged it. I was wearing my backpack what came from the ground was an ""Amulet"". I had no idea what the item did but as the last seconds of my life were running out I put it on. I died.
I thought it was over in just that second. But my mind was blown up when the amulet I just put on in that VERY second I died
That has probably been one of the most intense gaming experiences for me. Ever.

I am loving this game! I can't wait to get on with my first playthrough now that I am still alive!

1366685782.0,1cwt6r,The story of my last playthrough and the Beefalo,spellsy,45,2,11,"Hello

The round started normal, I did not know what this meant but since they had been so loyal with their poop and they defended me against these demon hounds, I wanted to somehow heal their butts. After searching for a possible remedy in the recipes I found this magic flute that I thought could soothe them. I had all the materials except for a mandrake, and while I had seen and gotten these before I did not know where to look. I set off on an adventure to find a mandrake and cure the red butts, I spent several days away from my base camp to try and find a mandrake, scouring my entire map from swamps to forests. I was unsuccessful, I failed my friendly beefalo :(, when I returned I discovered a new member to our family that I had never seen before - the baby beefalo! Maybe this was why they were so angry! Either way I adored him

Over the next 10-15 days or so I returned to normal

So, and tonight the beefalo all slept together in the forest. Desperate, low on health and food, I lit the forest on fire. It burned so bright that it seemed like it was already day; however, when the fire subsided there was only burned trees, ashes, and meat. I rushed for the meat; however, beefalo :(.

RIP Beefalo. RIP Wilson. ",self,t5_2v1jr,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/dontstarve/comments/1cwt6r/the_story_of_my_last_playthrough_and_the_beefalo/

When winter hit, and with nearby trees and plenty of boomerangs I had plenty of morsels from birds and wood to stock the fire. But my time spent actively playing the game was only ~1/4 of a day cycle, and I just surfed reddit during dusk/night with the game volume on in the background in case hounds or eyeclops showed up. I think that's a pretty pitiful way to ""play"" a video game.  

I think winter should be much shorter when compared to summer. I mean

I grabbed the trayfull of stale frog legs from the ice box and dashed to the nearest pig village. Their friendship

At first sight of the silky vermin the pigs charged forward with valor. I myself donned my Logsuit and jumped into the fray! Alas, nest after nest we fought! The pigs, barbaric creatures, would smash in a spiders head and then devour its raw, bleeding remains whole. I couldn't watch! 

When the dust settled, extremely hairy, and then started clawing wildly at me. My two companions fled the scene, shouting for home. Of course, the beast was no match for my skill with a pike.

Returning home, stumbled into a spider den we had missed earlier, and were quickly overun. Serves them right!

At the end of the day, and a large patch of leather from the hairy beast. I think I'll make a helmet out of it.

It's gotten to the point where I'm not really mad or upset when I die honestly.  Which is weird.  I usually do NOT like permadeath games or overly punishing games.  I always thought this kind of thing would make me really upset.

Now I'm just sort of surprised (as I imagine many other people are) when I die.  You get so good at it that you think you're invincible

You will need:

* 4 monster meat
* A spear or tentacle spike
* 2 free slots in your inventory (for drops)

Step 1) Feed a pig 1 monster meat.

Step 2) (optional) hang out close to the pig to regain some sanity if you need it.

Step 3) lure your pig away from other pigs if they are nearby.

Step 4) Feed the pig three more monster meat. This will prompt it to turn into a werewolf.

Step 5) **As the pig is transforming

Step 6) Gather the loot. They drop 2 meats and 1 pig skin.

This technique is good for a lot of reasons.

* Very easy to kill
* Doesn't contribute to your ""naughtiness"" 
* Consistent drops of both meat and pig skin

However

Now what if the science machine required 1 nitre instead of a golden nugget? Nitre drops off of every regular boulder at 40% which means I usually have a few at the end of my first day. I think this would allow players to set up a base a little sooner and spend time in tier one instead of jumping straight to tier two.

I don't think it would affect the balance of Wickerbottom too much as the change would allow her to put off searching for golden nuggets for a much longer time.

I'd be interested to hear what you guys think. Do you think it would make the early game too easy? I rather have the option to set up a early camp if I'm having bad luck exploring. I've had games where it took me 7 days to find one.

I have no health and it's getting late so I try to gey back to camp.  On my way back however I manage to get too close to some spiders and they follow me.  They came.  It started off small with one hound (which I managed to kill) bit the second one got me.  As I lay there the two hounds on screen began attacking the spiders.  I respawned at a touchstone beginning day 44.  I made a garland so I could get my sanity back up. Decide at that moment that I will swoop in and grab tentacle spike so that I can kill the remaining fiends.  So I approach the site and was greeted by six hounds on top of my gear (one ice hound and one fiery hound).  Instantly killed.  Respawn at my last touchstone and formulate a plan.  I headed back to base to grab some monster meat and recruited two pigmen.  We made our advance from the south and engaged the hounds.  The beasts ignored me and the battle began.  In the confusion I grabbed all of my gear and equipped my armor and tentacle spike.  I returned to help my friends fight the hounds but thwre was no-one around, and slayed the beast

Krampus spawned after 60+ bunny kills without me leaving any time for my naughtiness level to decrease. He managed to pick up a total of three items that were lying on the ground before I was able to chase him down and kill him. He took 6% of a tentacle spike to kill and hit me twice before I dropped him

I performed this test because I was:  
1. Bored  
2. Scared shitless during my last winter because I thought I was killing too many innocent creatures to survive

My consensus on this matter is this: Krampus doesn't even lift, run him down and punch him until he falls over, he's not to be feared.

King - Maxwell (Duh).
Queen - Spider Queen.
King's Bishop - Mechanical Bishop.
King's Knight - Mechanical Knight.
King's Rook - Obelisk.
Queen's Bishop - Tallbird.
Queen's Knight - Hound.
Queen's Rook - Treeguard.

White (Wilson's Side):
King - Wilson. 
Queen - Wendy.
King's Bishop - Science Machine.
King's Knight - Chester.
King's Rook - Pighouse.
Queen's Bishop - Teenbird.
Queen's Knight - Beefalo!
Queen's Rook - ???
Pawns - Pigs!

Edit 2: Just got back from the workshop
This is the start for the Obelisk and the Tallbird. Pieces will be 3x4.5x9 cm so it's gonna be a big board!

Hey guys! This run is still going strong. My goals are to finish off research and face the Spider Queen and Krumpus. 

Some tips for making a little further: 

**-Spend your first few days roaming and collecting.** 
Setting up a base can be done once you have sufficient supplies. I found that roaming the grassland and picking up as much grass, carrots, and doing some mining when you can on rocks you come across.

**-Once you are ready to set up camp
You will need to go science crazy on your first playthrough to unlock things. I would highly advise aiming for the Spear, and that wood will fuel a lot of other objectives.

**-Catch a bird
I would work on getting a bird cage (need to head to the swamp for the reeds)

**-Catch bees and build a few bee boxes.** Honey is an amazing counterpart to pumpkins as a stackable health consumable. Throw on your logging suit, they need it. 

**-Grow a manly beard, as one can be pulled from the heard and kited, with a much higher yield of the meat you need.

After this

Starting off with A Cold Reception, and explored a bit. Then I realized... There wasn't any flint. None. Nada. Not around anywhere. [A world without flint.](http://i.imgur.com/zQEirRf.png) Just that one flint I had to make an axe. I got scared. Then my priority was to explore to find flint.

I searched high and low. There was tons of rocks laying about, even 3 of the things! and this time I really needed that axe and spear left beside the things. At this point, I did attempt to make a base in between all the good stuff, but I didn't think of anything the science machine could help me with. (I still built one though, found some gold by the graves.)

Day 6, thought I'd burn it by some trees and lighting them on fire, but I had to be wary about the cold. Took a couple of days to finally get the job done. During that time I was out of food, starving, going insane, [trying to get killer bees to attack the spiders.](http://i.imgur.com/6gWuvJA.png) Got some honey out of it, but it wasn't gonna fill me up. I finally cross the bridge

But then I had to cross another bridge, but still needed the last thing. The potato thing. I hated that thing, it seems like the last thing I ever find. (Last run took me 100+ days to find) Had to go through the hound bridge again, but I was so glad the last thing was nearby, I just had to get through the night. Starving, but I had my just in case monster meat, but that might put me over the edge. Then rain

Attached the final thing. At this point I didn't care what I was bringing through, but surely it had to be under 20 days. That's a huge record for me. So nerve racking, at any moment I could've died, but despite the odds I did it! What an experience that was for me. Sorry if it wasn't interesting to read (or if some things didn't make sense), I'm not very good at writing out things, I am just so amazed and happy I got through.

* Giving pigs meat makes them help you! This includes mining and chopping down trees

* Farms will *not* help you survive winter. Get a berry plantation as a higher priority than farms

* One level three spider nest will match around ~4-6 pig houses in power. If you want continual farming of arachnids without all your pigs dying

* Fighting hounds is for suckers! Since monster meat is abundant, and save your traps for deerclops and Krampus.

* The more twigs, and if living in a plains biome, you now have unlimited twigs and grass for all your basic needs.

* Living near a road is handy for finding your way home

* The only thing worth farming is dragonfruit, are among the best food items in the game hunger/health versus resource wise.

* Spoiled food? Don't throw it out! Using **CTRL-Click!**, dropping each one and burning it. This is the best way to obtain ash in the game without destroying massive supplies of natural resources.

* Mandrakes don't have to die for you to survive. These adorable little creatures can be picked at dusk and will accompany you till dawn as the only creature cuter than Chester in the game. Defend your little green friends with a wall

* Keep track of a dirt pile nearby until the start of winter, along with a beard, can buy you around ~4 minutes of anti-freezing time. 

* Lastly, plus he has such a charming instrumental voice. Did I mention that he is **immortal**? Oh yeah. Once you start to accumulate beard hair and make it past day 16 for your first two-effigy-shave, you're *pretty much a god.*",,False,self,t5_2v1jr,,http://www.reddit.com/r/dontstarve/comments/1fka8w/handy_hints/

Firstly, tentacle spikes, and spiders ensued.

They're wonderful, and some could be refined. I think that my suggestions and improvements would be easy changes. 

(This all comes from a Wilson point of view. Let me know about the other characters in the comments)

**Periods**

I've noticed that some quotes lack periods. This isn't too bad

Quotes that lack periods:

* Stone Walls (placed)
* Fire Pit (unlit)
* Spear
* Pitchfork
* Cobblestones (aslo each words is capitalized)
* Papyrus
* Compass Directions 
* Others

**Missing Quotes**

Some things lack quotes. Wilson just says ""It's a... thing.""

Items that lack voice lines:

* Dapper Vest
* Ice Staff (fire staff has a quote. . .)
* Blow Dart


**My Suggestions**

I think should items need their own

* Individual Quotes for some clothing items (Wilson just says ""What a nice hat"")
* Different Levels of beeboxes
* Individual crock pot recipes (some have their own
* Proper quotes for feathers
* Mushtree stump
* Different spider ten tiers
* Turfs
* Traps

Also, and the noise should play.

1. The most effective way to take down a rabbit is to wait until it's a fair distance from its hole

2. Don't bait a trap because the net gain in food isn't worth the loss of a carrot (or whatever you use).

3. Drop traps near a rabbit (without scaring it) and then back up and drop a carrot so the trap is between the carrot and the rabbit. The rabbit should hop right into the trap as it goes for the carrot. Don't put the carrot too close to the trap or it will get eaten anyways.

* Hit one, smack it to death.

&gt; The **simplest** method. The problem I've found with this is that sometimes the other beefalo don't stop chasing you

* Plant trees/hay fences around a herd (possibly fenced in) and light it on fire when they have grown up enough

&gt; Pros: They won't attack you, is highly difficult to pull off without a horn. Unreliable. Note: Putting items (grass, charcoal) under them and lighting it on fire will damage them, but not very much, and will take many tries to actually get a kill. It is better if they are fenced in.

* Shave

&gt; Confirmed by [u/Ch-Shire](http://www.reddit.com/user/Ch-shire) to work. They might have to be in a large size herd to get the right amount of hair though.

* Pig Army

&gt; Beefalo usually outnumber your pig men

* Tooth Trap Line (credit: [u/vectorscopexy](http://www.reddit.com/user/vectorscopexy)

&gt; Highly effective

* Tooth Trap Placement (credit: [u/TeoSS69](http://www.reddit.com/user/TeoSS69))

&gt; The **safest** method. Place a tooth trap at a Beefalo's feet. It will go off and deal 60 damage. Pick it up

* Spiders / Hounds

&gt; Not reliable that they will actually kill any beefalo. At day 100+

* Gunpowder

&gt; I haven't seen anyone else do this yet, Gunpowder does more damage when stacked, so a stack of 3 should be able to kill an entire herd. Further testing is required.

* Lureplants (credit: [u/Ch-Shire](http://www.reddit.com/user/Ch-shire))

&gt; Adult Beefalos do quite a bit of damage and can take some punishment, Lureplant HP: 500, Eyeplant HP: 30, damage: 20, would take 25 hits by Eyeplants to kill one adult Beefalo, where as Eyeplants die in one hit. Baby Beefalo however will run away from the player, and thus can be 'herded' in to a field of Eyeplants which it will not retaliate against, one fur](http://dont-starve-game.wikia.com/wiki/Baby_Beefalo) per kill though).",t5_2v1jr,True

He starts out with 150 health

Next

* Starts with Lucy the axe
* He can cut trees at an accelerated rate
* Cutting trees too quickly will cause his curse to manifest
* His curse is a gift in many ways, mine boulders, uproot plants, destroy pig houses, regenerate beaver-health using the new ""Wood Meter""
* You can see very well at night in were-beaver form
* You cannot look at your map while in were-beaver form (at first I could but it seems now that you can't open the map)
* You can't pick anything up
* All it takes to return to his human self is time or damage
* Transforming back to human form causes him to lose 75 health

So far, because any trees around him can easily give him a ton of health, making his were-beaver form very sustainable. This was before the ""no-map nerf,"" which I'm still not sure really exists. If it does, I think that it should be reconsidered or removed because the map's function is too much to be removed, no matter what kind of curse you have. If it does not exist, Woodie may need some sort of nerf to make him less of a powerhouse, as a significant damage dealer will KO him more easily

Think about it. All of the characters are captured by Maxwell being, except for Wilson and Willow (a little). In the original promo video, there are skeletons in Wilson's lab. We can assume he was human testing, murdering people in the name of ""science."" For this, Maxwell plays Satan and decides to fuck with Wilson. Or, ""They"" put Maxwell up to it, and sitting on the Shadow Throne automatically turns him into a hellish judgment figure. We also know that Maxwell brought Willow from an insane asylum— she was probably there for her pyromania.

Last chance.. the second respawn point.. far far away from my base, save me! *Second screen crack!* I stop in my tracks, gaze upon my reflection in a frozen marsh and accept my faith, there is no coming back from this. I froze to death before I was even a third of the way home.

- Move lots of berry bushes to my base
- Farm silk
- Silk makes bird traps and birds are stored in chests for winter
- Collect many berries into the ice box
- Make Meatballs using berries

I can get wood nearby without too much problem. So I have two questions:

1) Should I be doing anything different?

2) Should I enjoy the world I have until I accidentally die somehow? (I also have touched a stone and could make meat effigies.)

It's almost like I can't die even if I wanted to. Not only does he have more health and hunger

And what's worse is that you unlock this character after playing long enough to become an expert.  

The progression from Willow to Wendy feels good. You survive for long enough by taking care to always have light and you unlock a character which removes the need for that grind

I haven't played Wendy much

Wolfgang on the other hand just seems OP. So here are my suggestions:

Wolfgang should perhaps starve faster and require more food? It seems odd

Or perhaps Wolfgang should be the first character you play, should be the final unlock-able characters. I feel that paradoxically the first characters is also the hardest to survive with and the last the easiest.

* **How to unlock [Maxwell](/spoiler) is at the bottom of the post**

* **How to enable console commands:**

1\. On Windows &amp; Mac go to *&lt;Documents&gt;\Klei\DoNotStarve\settings.ini* On Linux go to *~/.klei/DoNotStarve/settings.ini*

2\. In *settings.ini* change

    [MISC]

    ENABLECONSOLE = false

to

    [MISC]

    ENABLECONSOLE = true

(On a Mac use TextEdit to open settings.ini if you have to manually select an application for settings.ini to open on.)

* **Console Commands:**

Use the ""~"" key in game to open the console

Use the Enter/Return key to execute the command

**Warning: All commands will wear off upon leaving the game**

* **Creative Mode:**
 
*GetPlayer().components.builder:GiveAllRecipes()* This will give you the ability to craft every recipe wether you have the resources or not.

*GetPlayer().components.health:SetMaxHealth(insert number here)*

* **Skip days:** 

*for x = 1

Replace the 15 with the number corresponding to the number of days you want to skip. Be aware this is very slow because the game saves once everyday.

* **Reveal Full Map:** First execute

*minimap = TheSim:FindFirstEntityWithTag(""minimap"")* 

* Next execute

*minimap.MiniMap:ShowArea(0, 10000)*

* **Useful functions**

or


* You can enter adventure mode using console commands

*TestAdventureLevel(#)*

**I saw this on the wiki but I couldn't get it to work myself**

* **WARNING: In order to unlock Maxwell you will have to watch the endgame sequence which will spoil adventure mode** 

1. Start a **NEW** game with any character and find some open room

2. Execute *DebugSpawn(""maxwellthrone"")* This should spawn maxwell in his throne

3. Execute *DebugSpawn(""maxwelllock"")* This should spawn a lock

1366387325.0,1cojaz,Day 50 RIP Wilson (Survived my first Winter!),Chocolatechip_cookie,18,6,12,"This is the first time I've managed to survive winter (thought I would share my joy!) and the longest I've ever survived in general.

Wilson went through some pretty harsh stuff this time around:

- Discovering the Hand in the dark for the first time (easy peasy stuff
- Setting himself on fire and resurrecting *facepalm*
- Having the visit of a Spider Queen at his BASE
- Almost freezing to death
- Almost getting killed by the Koallefant
- Almost getting killed by spiders
- Having hardly ANY rocks to mine... still didn't find a single field of rocks

But there were also  some wonderful accomplishments:

- Building his first bee-box
- Stocking up a full icebox with all sorts of yummy recipies
- Catching a Koalefant and creating a puffy vest (YESSSS! Getting all that silk almost got me killed twice -_-)
- Having a nice stock of gold (in the two digits


After being well set up for the second winter (puffy vest, etc) Wilson went exploring to find Things (only had a Ring Thing so far)... he got attacked by spiders on his first night away from ""home"" aaaand died. No resurrection this time around =(",,False,self,t5_2v1jr,False,,
