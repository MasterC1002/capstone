For the past five hours I've read every scripture, getting your hair cut in particular styles, or wearing cotton/polyester shirts, which are all forbidden ""laws"" in the same book that forbids homosexuality. You don't get to choose which laws you want to enforce and which ones you don't. Those laws weren't even written for us, they were written for the people of Israel. The laws that we were supposed to abide with from the Old Testament was added to the New Testament. Forbidding shaving, haircuts and cotton shirts weren't added. Forbidding homosexuality wasn't either. 

Apart from the religious standpoint (which is only significant because it seems to be argued the most) Judging others and refusing them rights simply because they don't share the same beliefs as you, you have my full support. I only wish I'd realized years ago, how ignorant my mindset was. It probably doesn't mean much, but please know that as you all continue to fight for the rights and equality that you deserve, I'll be fighting just as hard.

This past friday, or Navy Chief. (To put this into perspective, and highlight the importance, around 6000 people took the test for advancement to E7 and less than 200 made it. It's the biggest and most important promotion in the Navy.) There were 9 from my command that were pinned on Friday. 

During the pinning, and pins the new Chief. It's a very formal and long-standing tradition. At one point, the MC said, ""Chief Select John Smith will be pinned by his partner Chris Smith."" And a man walked on stage, pinned the Chief, and then they shared a brief kiss and embrace before walking off the stage together.

I think this shocked a lot of people because, openly, in uniform. I was happy, though, there were no boos, whispers, or gasps. Everybody actually clapped. It was heartwarming.

1344652756.0,y13rs,A Straight Guy's Education in Gayitude,CitizenTed,156,22,12,"I'm a straight guy. But I once had a gay buddy named Leo.

Leo was from a conservative Mexican family. His father was one of those guys with a pencil-thin mustache and stern desire to see his two boys integrate fully and become educated

Leo still lived at home with his parents and their resentment was palpable. Gay

They didn't realize how sensitive Leo was about other people. I was his best friend and I was straight. He never made passes at me or made me feel uncomfortable. Just the opposite: he totally understood me and knew I just liked to smoke and joke and socialize downtown. We were friends and he was totally capable of maintaining the boundaries of two guys who were pals. 

Being an inquisitive sort

Of course he did. But he explained that his sexual attraction was tilted to a much higher degree toward men

To a certain extent yes and to another extent, too. He had no option and no choice. If only his parents could understand that. 

Leo was also a believer in ""gaydar"". He said when he met me he knew in a heartbeat I was hopelessly straight and there was no point in hitting on me

We had many conversations about gay and straight

One day

I remember visiting him in the hospital and being asked to wear a mask in his room. I didn't have the heart to tell the nurse I had smoked a hundred joints with the guy and if his saliva was deadly I was probably in deep shit already

Leo got out of the hospital, he was starting to get a little bit demented. He'd sometimes talk in circles and laugh at things that weren't funny. 

As the months went by he got worse. He was always cool around me but around other people (including our friendly weed connection) he would act surly and unreasonable. He started stealing money from people then denying it. I tried talking to him about it

Eventually

He called me once

In July of 1989, he'd be cremated and his ashes tossed. 

I just couldn't do it. And I wasn't even sure what Leo really wanted. We let the State do what it wanted. Leo was just a memory now. 

But I never forgot him. He put a human face on gay rights. And that's the most powerful tool you can have to win hearts and minds. I'm still straight as ever yet you won't find a more ardent supporter of gay rights. Denying gay people the right to marry then dismissing them as hopelessly promiscuous is the height of arrogance and hypocrisy. 

I'm not gay

**tl;dr:** my gay friend helped me understand what gay is all about. Then he died.

(Yeah I'm not good with titles),EccentricRavenclaw,112,15,10,I'm 14 years old and I had a crush on a guy for sometime now and we've been talking almost everyday and we told each other that we are gay. Him and I made each other jealous. I told him about guys that I liked and he did the same and I did it to make him jealous and he then started talking to my friend and he told her that whenever I bring up a guy he does the same thing. Yesterday I told him that I liked him and I cared deeply about him and he said that he liked me too. I was going to ask him to go out with me but I think that's kinda stupid so I said (insert full name here) will you be my boyfriend and he said yes.

I unloaded the shotgun and picked up the phone and went out with friends. Since that night things are still hard but i know I'll make it now. Once I get a job I can recover everything he stole from me, and the guy I am currently seeing is trying to work through my trust issues and pain.

I'm not saying that I always use protection but I do use it when I'm having sex with someone I barely know or trust and last night I got a shocking realisation that I should be more careful when meeting with guys.

What made me realise this? Well last night a random guy messaged me asking if I wanted to get fucked, for all I know they could of been raped so I politely told him that I wasn't interested in unprotected sex with a guy who had HIV. I didn't tell him to fuck off or anything and kept talking to him afterwards, I even asked him if he's ever *pozzed* someone which he replied saying he had fucked one *neg* guy. It's nice that he told me immediately that he's *poz* but he was persistent and kept trying to persuade me to meet up with him, for bare sex of course. After that I started ignoring him and he did leave me alone, though I'm not sure that's the last I'll hear from him.

That experience only made me think I should be more careful about the guys I'm meeting up with. Tonight I was telling this guy that I've been talking to a lot recently online about it and eventually we got on the topic of meeting up for fun

Now I'm not new to the scene and I've known all about these sort of acts for some time now but it's the first time someone's asked me stuff like this and I think that it's a good idea to tell you guys what sort of things you should be careful of.

**What you may need to know:**

- It's basic knowledge that *poz* means HIV+ and *neg* means HIV-.

- *Stealthing* is the act of fucking someone unprotected without their consent

*Stealthing* has another definition too

- There are men who identify as *bug chasers* which are men who are wanting to get HIV

- Some *gifters*, with long sharp fingernails or tearing your ass open by shoving either a big object like a dildo in or their cock without stretching you first or using lube). Saying all that some will refrain from using lube as it's counter-productive to their goal.

- Many *poz* men get a *biohazard tattoo* or a similar tattoo


So yea

I awoke 48 hours ago and set off to the local used book store/rad coffee shop. The place was busy, and I worked up the courage to ask if he would like to walk with me. He said yes, and the whirlwind had started. 

In the three hours that followed we traversed the open air viaduct above the train tracks. Here fluid conversation had me telling him the intimate details of my being. I knew this was the guy I could entrust more than my ideas with. We ended up at a park laying on our backs describing the things we could see in the clouds. We were briefly interrupted by a phone call saying he was late to an appointment

I had spent the past decade confused about my sexuality. I tried with women a few times but the experience was always excruciatingly forced. I dreaded that point where, this on the other hand, was natural. I was giddy. It had no bearing of resemblance to any first dates I had ever been on. I got home and we texted over the next few hours. He asked if he could pick me up after he got off of work, I agreed. I was hardly able to stop myself from jumping on him at the park.

He surprised me by taking me into the mountains in the dark. We bouldered up treacherous rocks until we were, a mere 8 hours after we first met, but we stayed until sunrise. I had gotten to peek at and feel his chest and abs, but as temperatures dropped and rocks dug into our backsides, the possibility of much more was ruled out. 

I had, and invited him back to my apartment. But by the time we made it back down from the mountain, with a mass of hesitation in his voice, he said needed to go home and get ready for work. It was 6 am.

The day passed and I tried to get some recovery sleep. There was absolutely no way I could not share the story among friends. Coming out to them was glorious. it was gleeful. There was not a shred of self doubt as I waited in anticipation of nightfall.

I will leave to the imagination all that happened last night(and this morning!). I got to use my breakfast ingredients.

I grew up in a baptist home and my dad is a baptist pastor. I was outed to my family and some people in the church this past October of 2012. While i'm still at home I've been in deep discussion with my dad on the Biblical stand piont on homosexuality. I identify myself as Christian and know how to apply the Bible properly as far as what I believe. Unlike many people who catagorize themselves as ""Christian"". I really like Matthew Vines lecture and have used this info as well as my own study to show my parents that the Bible does not condemn homosexuality. But I still need some help. Here is what I need answers to:

1. Are there any POSITIVE examples for homosexual relationships. Relationships between a man and a woman are clearly defined as right and also how to treat each other in a relationship. My position currently is that the Bible is neutral on homosexuality. It neither condemns nor vilifies it. 

2. Can someones inner core as a person (their sexual orientation) change. We know many people can change things about themselves but can their sexual orientation actually change. Matthew Vines says no but my dad says yes.

Well theres this guy whos name is Jake. Me and Jake have been bestfriends since sandbox times. When we entered High School Jake came out of the closet but no one was really surprised. Our mutual friends and myself treated him the same and accepted him completly. In the middle of our senior year Jake conessed that he loved me more than a friend or a brother and was convinced that I was the ONE. Now after this our relationship tarnished. I was completly straight and had no intention of ""breaking on through to the other side"". Please understand this. I am actracted to women 100%. I can recognize if a guy is good looking but nothing at all physically attracts me about a man. Well when me and Jake stopped hanging out I sort of hit a depression. I felt terrible for allowing my best friend to leave my life simply because he loved me. I contacted him and it wasnt long before we were best friends again. However something had changed. Our bro time stadted turning into dates and started to become emotionally dependent on one another. I began to what I can only describe as fall in love with him and last night he kissed more for the first time and surprisingly enough I kissed him back. Now this is where im confused. Im not sure if I would be able to have a realtionship with Jake. I love more than anyone I know but im not attracted to him in that way.

1362404509.0,19mxwy,Coming Out in the 80's: My Story (part one),ademnus,85,11,13,"Someone suggested I share my own coming out experiences with the next generation of gay men, and objects in mirror are closer than they appear.

I was born in 1970 and, Superheroes were [everywhere](http://loyalkng.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/wonder-woman-1.jpg) and children were raised to be [peaceful](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/11/10/arts/television/magic.span.jpg).

Then the 80's arrived.

Pop culture tried to be more sophisticated and lost the sequens and sparkles and disco balls. Television in general started to be more open and honest and people like Phil Donohue began speaking openly about subjects once only whispered about. But when AIDS appeared on the scene

And that's how I found out I was gay.

Previous to this, I thought something was wrong with me. I thought, if my parents found out, they'd put me in an asylum. It terrified me -but I also couldn't deny my feelings. Then, one afternoon in 1983, I was playing with my legos in my room when a tv news woman explained AIDS (still called GRIDS, Gay Related Immune Deficiency Syndrome) and said, a homosexual

I just stood there and stared at the screen. She was describing me. I wasn't the only one in the world. We had a name. And, I had a sense of belonging and no longer felt alone. There wasn't something wrong with me after all.

As the months went by, picture a 1950's style crewcuts-and-discipline boarding school minus the boarding). I was also very religious, as you might imagine, after spending nearly my entire life in parochial school. But, right down the street was a small convenience store that I frequented for my candy and gum. One afternoon, I wandered into the back area and found a hidden treasure trove of *all gay porn mags*. I was slack-jawed. Hot men graced the covers of dozens of slicks (what gay mags were called back then because their covers were shiny and slick, thick paper). I cautiously selected one as well as a newspaper and a puzzle magazine. I was absolutely terrified to bring it to the register. I slipped the mag between the newspaper and puzzle book, I was 13. i was shitting a brick at the counter as the fellow began ringing it up. He rang up the newspaper, took the bag with my items

Needless to say, I read the articles. I gained an understanding of being gay, coming out, politics, the gay communities around the country and so many things no one could have sat down and told me. I also got an eyeful of a sexuality I hadn't even dreamed up. I started getting into some of the leather mags too. I knew if my parents ever found my ever-increasing storehouse of porn I was truly doomed.

By 1984 I had come to understand myself and gayness well enough that I decided I had to start coming out. I couldn't take the lying and hiding and pretending. I couldn't just tell my mother and father right away, I told her.

She told me it was a sin and I'd go to hell.

She said she'd keep my secret, and she did -we are still friends to this day. But she shocked me. And I had never heard this notion that being gay was a sin. That afternoon, I sat in my religion class and brooded. I don't know how it happened, but someone mentioned it and I piped up and said that was a ridiculous notion. But the teacher said I was wrong, and promptly read the dreaded passage from Leviticus. I felt sick. I waited about 10 minutes, so as not to arouse suspicion, and excused myself to the boy's bathroom. I stood in a stall and cried my eyes out. How could God hate me for something I didn't do, and didn't hate? I felt very guilty and totally abandoned by God for quite a few years.

Still, I can't believe I told a teacher at a religious private school. She knew I had aspirations of being an actor and said, ""well, its something I was concerned about because theater attracts *those people*."" I didn't care for her tone. 

She tried to tell me that she thought the male penis was ugly and wondered how I could like that. I told her I thought it was beautiful. She said she hoped she'd never see me in a parade. I've walked in the pride parade of many cities for many decades since. But she didn't fly off the handle and she didn't smack me with the bible. She said she loved me anyway. I decided rehearsal was over

My mother was sitting and folding laundry when her youngest son came to her and said, I couldn't have said Gay?

Well

""Nothing, my parents have been married for exactly 60 years. They fell in love as teenagers and were married at 18. They eloped. They are approaching 80 now, and very ill. And they still hold hands. I've never known two people more in love than them. Its where I get my monogamousness from and my lfielong pursuit of true love. She'd never kept a secret from him in her life. But she kept mine. Maybe it was fear, maybe it was shame, I don't know -but she promised not to tell him and she didn't.

But the ensuing weeks were hard. She cried. She was depressed. She blamed herself. And she kept telling me it was just a phase. I couldn't take it. No boy wants to be the reason his mother cries. So, I told her, ""You were right mom, it was just a phase.""

She was delighted. ""See? I told you! Oh I'm so happy."" The words burned to hear. Me not being me made her happy. But she was happy and that was enough for me. At least I wouldn't feel like a total disappointment.

But I did decide to tell my oldest brother. I'm the youngest of 4 boys and while I'm farthest in age from my oldest brother I was always closest to him -and still am. I summoned up the courage -or at least tried to

""You're gay.""

I was stunned. We were driving together in his car and I stared at him in disbelief. ""How did you know?!""

He opened the glove compartment and pulled something out. He tossed it in my lap. I looked down. It was a gay slick. ""It takes one to know one.""

I was stunned. We were both gay. I was absolutely floored. Thereafter we spent a lot of time together. He took me to Fire Island for the first time and I got to see actual living

I remained quiet about it to my parents for a few more years. One day, so I didn't really relate to the drag-queen main character. But I related to what he had to say. And Anne Bancroft, who played his mother, somehow had managed to channel my own mother perfectly. Oh, her character was jewish and my mother is italian, but the differences are subtle at best. [This scene had a major impact on how I viewed myself as a gay man.](http://youtu.be/rOsH_pbfOV8?t=3m6s)

I had never heard anyone say things like this before. Prior to this, Arnold and his mother couldn't really repair their relationship. [This is how she left.](http://youtu.be/nCAxExyC69A?t=5m11s)

I couldn't stop crying. I didn't want that to be us. It took me a few hours of pacing in my room to decide I had to come out to her... again.

I sat down with her alone that night. Dad was already in bed. We talked about nothing for a while; the weather, ""Mom, do you remember what I told you when I was 14?""

She replied instantly and in a soft voice. ""I never forgot. ...Has anything changed?""

""Only my taste in men

""I figured. I've had a long time to think about this and I have a few things to say. First, God made you and He doesn't make mistakes. I don't care what the bible says. I love you and He loves you and don't even worry about what some stupid church says. I can't say I totally understand but I'll support you no matter what.""

It seems the seed I'd planted had bourne fruit in the intervening years. It hadn't been a mistake. It had given her time to think. And I don't think I've ever been more proud of my mom -or proud to be her son. Still

She did.

OK guys. I took all of your advice and I did come out to my friends. My friends supported me wholeheartedly. They love me for who I am and are the best friends I could ever have. I told one friend and she was absolutely fine with it. I know I can trust her, and they all accepted me and loved me even more (because you know, some girls want gay best friends for some reason). Some of the guys know (which will make gym class a whole lot more awkward). But overall, everyone at my school accepted me as being gay.
But the thing is my parents. My sister is already homosexual, and he didn't believe it was right for me to be gay. He still loves me, and that's all I wanted to happen. He won't support anything I do for being homosexual, but when i'm 18, he says I can do whatever I want! Since this happened, he won't let me male friend I was talking about come over to my house anymore. He says that if I was heterosexual, he wouldn't have let me have girls over. Now that i'm homosexual, guys.

Having been blessed enough to be born and raised in a family with absolutely liberal, he was raised a bit more traditionally but eventually in later life he quickly realised how dumb he had been), to me it was just and will always be just a normal and welcome condition of nature,just as there are apples and pears. 

But I also realise that many (if not all) of my own opinions and worldviews are just a result of the environment in which I was brought up, I could as well be a misogynistic homophobic had I been raised by a family of rednecks. 

When you are a straight

Now here is (what I believe to be) the most awesome thing about being gay: If you are gay and were born in a free-thinking family and/or live in a liberal city, I guess you will eventually face some kind of discrimination; but even more admiring is if you have the disgrace to be born gay in a hostile/religious/repressive environment. Only then you can turn that weakness into an advantage. Because realising about your own ""abnormal"" sexuality in a hostile environment means that, unless you are a total dumbass with a life devoid of purpose, you will have to face, confront and internally debate every aspect of your own social environment and you will break yourself free from it. This is a gift that is mostly granted to gay people-until a day comes when everyone loves and respects everybody and we all hold hands together while John Lennon plays the guitar. But until that day comes, you are given the true gift of free will and that only makes you stronger and more human, while the rest of us ""normal"" people just follow the herd because sheep don't have any reason to struggle.

I don't know about you but I find that awesome

Am I exaggerating?

1329505209.0,pu7si,Is it possible to be gay for just one guy?,concaution,68,8,53,"Context: I am a 17-year old son of two gay dads. My upbringing has been healthy

I firmly believe that I am straight. Given the environment I've lived in, because if I were gay, I'd still receive the same amount of love and support from the people around me. And I think my gay dads would be happier (it's sort of a joke, that me being straight is a ""disappointment""). They always said that it would be great if I just dated my best friend, because we look ""cute"" together.

Which brings me to my point. I have a guy best friend (we're both 17, we grew closer after that. We hung out more, he became less introverted, he talks about more stuff now other than COD and Skyrim. He tries to talk me about guys, but sometimes I feel uncomfortable (especially when things turn graphic, he can be vulgar lol), but I listen to him anyway. Once I asked him if he would date me if I was gay. He was like, I'd marry you

Until recently, and the only thing I'm waiting for is when we can skype next. It's only been a day since he left. This isn't the first time I've missed him though. I could chalk it up to feeling the same way as a brother would for his sibling, but I feel like that's not really it. There's just way too many things aside from that that makes me think I'm in love with him.

Don't get me wrong, but I felt so awkward the whole time, and I never got hard. I've also tried looking at other guys, but I feel no attraction (sexual or otherwise) towards them.

I do feel that way exclusively for my best friend though. I thought it was pretty harmless at first, try to relieve myself to gay porn, but it's still a no go. But when I fantasized about us doing, well, things together, that sure did it (and it was embarrassingly quick). And it wasn't so much that I imagined what it feels like to have sex with him as me wanting to be intimate with him. I think what got me off easy was the fact that I felt so close to him, like there was a feeling of deeper connection (pun not intended).

Which brings me to my question (and several follow-ups). Is it possible to be gay for one guy? Am I straight? Bisexual? Gay? Should I tell him about it? I feel like I'm being unfair claiming that I'm straight but I'm attracted to him. There are a lot of scary thoughts going through my mind right now

I know I'm young and I still have a long ways to go

**EDIT 1:** So idk if this is an update but i thought of asking my dads about it. i thought it was a good idea

also i'll be talking to my best friend tomorrow. please pray for my soul lol

**EDIT 2:** Finally got to talk. I could've probably executed my speech better, let's just say i stuttered a lot? he didn't say anything for a while, but then just when i was about to wordvomit ""loljok nvm i was just kidding when i told you i love you *love you* ten minutes ago"" he said it would be better for us to be just friends *for now* at least. broke my heart to pieces, not even going to lie. we're still hanging out tomorrow though, crossing my fingers that i don't feel too sad and awkward. ugh fml.",,False,t5_2qhef,True

I'm a closeted gay man who works at a gas station with a restaurant attached. My brother (who is openly gay) used to work at the restaurant
   When I got the job, especially since most of them thought he was a great guy. I started working with this guy who worked for the gas station while my brother was employed next store all the time. This coworker has a lot of problems, he's really negative and lazy with an alcohol problem. He loves playing warcraft and skyrim. He's the kind of guy to talk about every girl that walks in to the store.
   So, we got on the topic of my brother the other day. We talked about P's personality a little and I brought up a few stories from when were kids. Out of nowhere he said; ""So how's that faggot doing?"" Not sure how to react I snapped and said; "" Faggot? That faggot, or my brother P, is making 50k a year with amazing benefits and perks. That faggot P has a positive outlook for the future. That faggot doesn't have a drinking problem so bad, that he has to beg customers for tips. That faggot doesn't sit at home playing skyrim with nude mods attached like a pervert. P enjoys his life regardless of what other people think. What about you? Where are you in life? Do you have any ""problems"" that you want pointed out?"" He didn't know what to say, so I walked out and took my break. The rest of the day it was really awkward. He didn't talk and tried to avoid me when possible.
I realized later it was a little harsh, this situation made me realize I should be sticking up for them more. He eventually apologized after the manager found out and almost fired him. While I accepted his apology, I told him; ""No one is perfect. No one likes being ostracized for their choices or beliefs, that's why I follow the golden rule. My brother's sexuality is none of your concern, and your problems are not mine. I don't hate you, I have no problems with your choices. I only brought them up to prove a point.  Try respecting people for being different and you may enjoy life a little more.""
We really didn't talk much after that

What do you think?

Last day I was studying at my boyfriend's house when I opened the secontary browser (he usually uses Chrome and I thought I could use Safari so I wouldn't break his privacy) and the last results showed only porn. Gay porn at least. I then looked the browser history and all I found was porn. Every single one of the pages he visited. Like every two days even when we meet. I was looking for respecting his privacy and I ended up using his porn-only browser.

I know this is a normal thing. I myself use this kind of sites quite often and I think everyone does. What bothers me is the fact that he usually is very reluctant to having sex. He has this imaginary schedule; never after eating, etc. So basically quite boring when it comes to sex and quite unwilling to have it just when I feel like doing it. So finding that he usually watches porn almost every day and some days even more than once or twice is really bothering me.

For instance, he had just been watching porn! I mean he knew I was coming and yet he did it. I really wouldn't mind it if it wasn't that later I tried to have sex with him and he said to me he had no time and he had to sudy. Really?

I know watching porn is not bad in a relationship

**TL;DR** my boyfriend watches porn every day while he's unwilling to have good sex with me. My penis is depressed because of this.

I just thought I'd share my little tale with you all

I came out to my parents when I was 18. From about 15-17, chatting, kissing occasionally, but I just put it down to my own social awkwardness and geeky nature that I'd never thought to go any further than the peck-on-the-lips kissing. 

Then, and started talking to, a guy in a furry chatroom. Within the year we were dating, and to this day, we still are - infact, we've been living together for the past 6 years or so *(since I started University and got a flat with him in the Uni's city)*, and it's going great.

Now, because I was confident they'd be supportive, and thankfully, they were - my mom was apparently shocked and cried a bit when she found out *(I wasn't around when Dad told her)* but she quickly recovered and accepted it was who I was, and told me directly that she still loved me just the same, which was awesome to hear and helped me along a lot. My brothers also accepted me easily, as did their respective partners *(both female, although the younger of them

The sad point came when I found out that my Uncle *(my sister-in-law's dad)*, needless to say, both shocked and upset to find out he'd acted like that.

The blow was softened significantly when my sister-in-law explained that he didn't hate me - but having grown up himself in Brighton, he had seen the very flamboyant, in-your-face side of the gay community, and as much as anything, he was afraid he'd do or say something to offend me and ruin the christmas experience for everyone. I explained to her that I didn't care - I'm not a 'stereotypical' gay guy, and thus far I've not found a gay joke I didn't find funny, but apparently this didn't take.

For the next 3 years, my brothers and their partners, my parents and my Nan *(my mum's mum)*, and a second one with my sister-in-law's parents and her own biological family. It wasn't the way she wanted it, or I, but it sufficed to keep everyone happy.

And now the good bit.

Last year, along with my mum *(my dad having passed away two years previously)* and my nan, for an Easter BBQ and egg-hunt for their kids. I said yeah, of course we would, and on the day, my mother drove the three of us down to my sister in law's place for the planned event.

What I wasn't expecting was, sat on the grass and being instructed on the finer points of my youngest niece's newest doll by said niece. I looked at my sister in law with a raised eyebrow and before I could say anything, she called out to her Dad to tell him I and my partner had arrived.

It was at this point that he proceeded to do the bravest and most humbling thing I have ever seen a man do; which is to walk up to his gay nephew (me!), for his behaviour, admit he shouldn't have made everyone go to such lengths to help him avoid facing what he feared, and ask if I would forgive him. I didn't even hesitate in doing so, because god only knows I love my uncle like I love any member of my family and I was glad to see the split over and done with, but to this day I'm still proud to say that I bore witness to a member of the older generation bridging the gap and admitting they were wrong.

Then it happens.... I get horny for it again. 

I can't talk to anyone about this. Sometimes when I get the cravings my sex drive for women goes completely flat and I lose interest in any women in my life. The rest of the time I'm normally a horn ball for them.

This is really dangerous behavior. I don't want to end up meeting the next Jeffrey Dohmer (spelling) or similair homicidal gay maniac that likes submissive men. I'm scared I'm going to get myself seriously hurt, or given a nasty disease like HIV or another STD.

I got curious and made an ad

I was super nervous as i made my way over but excited all at the same time. I'm 23 meeting an older divorced man in his late 50's. He greeted me at the door and we did some small talk over a beer. i told him about myself and i learned he was a professor at a local university. If it wasn't kinky enough...

I sat finishing my beer trying to bring up the real reason i was there when he finally asked me if i wanted to go upstairs to the bedroom. I smiled and nodded as i felt the butterflies in my stomach. We walked up and as we got into the room he turned to me and kissed me.

I've never kissed a man and honestly

It was ok

We gently kissed as we tiptoed toward the bed and i layed ontop getting more into the kissing. I enjoyed the tickle of his moustach and began kissing down his chest and belly when i saw his cock.

Here goes nothing i thought and holding with one hand i licked the head of his penis and brought it into my mouth. He was uncut and tasted clean. Up and down i slurped his cock in a nice slow pace. I could begin to taste the salty precum and it made me more horny.

It felt great, suck and repeat. 

We got into 69 when he finally blew his load right down my throat. I never even saw it. He finished me off asking to cum in his mouth at the end. It was wild. We cuddled for a bit after

I wanted reddit to hear my story. May have found a new mature friend... Anyone else have a similar expience with someone older or same age?

Two years ago I had a stroke. I was very confused for a week or 2 and still find my brain acting strange on occasion. But I recovered. My personality seemed unchanged. And it was for awhile. Ok, might not. But I could still feel pleasure and get an orgasm. Just no erection. 

I started to notice weird things were turning me on. Weird for me anyways. I was seeing erotic undertones in movie dialog between males that wasn't there. I think I was making them up subconsciously and inserting them

This left me scared and confused. I have never had thoughts like these. I started reading story's. Watching porn. I still liked straight porn too. But I'm not sure which I prefer at this point?

So I told my wife. She thinks I've been a little rewired by the stroke. It happens. She's not angry or hurt or anything. She is a saint. Thats why I married her. But now I wonder what to do from here. I have no social circle to speak of. And none of the few friends I do have would be very understanding of my situation.

His exact words were, don't sit next to me at lunch, and don't talk to me in class. You're twisted."" And he meant it. For the entirety of senior year he would not say one word to me except for two instances. Once to tell me all gay people should be put on island to die and again to tell me I was sick. It absolutely destroyed me. However, as I told more of my friends, they turned out to accept me -and reject him for being an asshole. It taught me that some people you're sure will accept you may not -and those you are sure won't just might. You never know when you come out to someone. It lets you know who your real friends are.

I didn't know if they'd be friendly or if they'd like me or not. I was very nervous. But in time, we came to all be friends and it was a very positive experience for me. The leaders of the group taught us about safer sex, for one thing, and helped us deal with the social stigma we suffered that was very different from how things are today. Some states still had sodomy laws. Nowhere could you marry legally. And positive public opinion of us polled far, far lower than it does today.

Dad was always a big hunter and fisherman, and he pointed to the shotgun on the wall.

For weeks afterwards I kept asking her on the phone if she had told him. ""I still haven't found the right time."" I laughed. ""Two weeks and no time? See... it isnt easy, ""look, I don't think he needs to know. Just let it go."" But she wouldn't. Within a few days... she told him.

Now, she was sobbing crying when dad came home from work that day and he went pale, asking, ""what is it?! What's the matter?!"" She couldn't answer, she only cried. Dad assumed one of us, me or my brothers, was dead. He asked her if it was me. She nodded. ""Is he dead?!"" She shook her head. ""He's gay.""

Thanks mom, tough as shit father, who didn't cry at his own father's funeral...cried. 

Still, so I was absolutely terrified. He sounded terrible. But what he said has stuck with me for my entire life.

""Yeah. Your mom told me. You didn't have to be afraid to tell me. I'm your father. You're my son and I still love you

I instantly burst into tears, ""...and God willing, one day it'll go away.""

I laughed through my tears. ""Its not the flu

""Yeah

He handed back the phone and that was that. We didn't speak about it again for a very long time.

Fast forward out of the 80s...past the 90s... and its the year 2000. Y2k was the mayan prediction of the Oh's and 9/11 hadn't happened yet. My brother, felt being an out gay man was an impossibility -came out of the closet. He and wife amicably divorced and are still best friends. And then...so did another of my brothers. Three of the four of us are gay. We tell our one straight brother that its ok that he's straight; every family has one. I was proud to realize that I, the youngest, the ""baby,"" came out first and paved the way for the older brothers. Of course, they elected to both come out to our parents *one the same day* so its a miracle the two old folks survived. But they had had practice, and eventually handled it well.

I met a man whom I fell in love with beyond anyone I'd ever met. By this time I was living in Florida, as I now do. I brought my boyfriend to my parent's condo for dinner.

All the way up in the elevator I paced. He grinned at me and put his huge arm around my shoulders. ""Aw that's so cute -you're nervous

""Like you? I'm not worries they won't like you. I'm worried you'll meet them and ditch me."" We laughed. I wasn't really kidding. They're quite a comical pair

Well

Mom told me how handsome she thought my now ex was. She nattered on about how muscular he was and how nice he seemed and that I'd done well. I really couldn't believe my ears. Two decades of Oprah had really changed her.

But nothing -and I mean nothing

I walked back in to find my father... MY FATHER... with his arm around my boyfriend's shoulders, dad told me over the phone, ""he's one great guy. I really like him."" Who could have ever guessed we'd have that conversation.

Today, isn't doing very well. My father, who worked in a concrete yard his entire life, has had lung cancer from years of exposure to cement dust and other particulates. He lost one lung 2 years ago and last week we were told he has spots on his one remaining lung. Frankly, I don't know how long I will have either of them. But I am very, very proud of my parents and all they have dealt with from 3 gay sons and Im trying to enjoy the time I have left with them. All lives end, and most children must bury their parents. I'm proud to have had the ones I did and to be able to help care for them at the end of their lives. I still can't help but feel these two who have been on their honeymoon for 60 years will, somehow go as they always have -together.

You might have similar experiences to mine. Maybe you once thought you were the only one in the world who was gay. Maybe you went to a religious school. Or maybe you have gay sibling. Then again, and every relationship comes with its own set of unique complexities an variables. 

I can't tell you how and when you should come out and I can't tell you if your family will be supportive or abandon you. But there are a few things I *can* tell you

First, they can love you today because *you are the same person today that you were yesterday -they just know something different about you now.*

Second, ""its a phase,"" to, ""he's so handsome!"" Yours may too. Don't burn any bridges and don't reflect back to someone the hate they may show you. Tomorrow they might come to accept you.

But most of all, *it does get better.* Its easy to feel that it won't, especially when you're young. But take heart. You have a lot to live for and look forward to and things will change. Don't let it keep you down. Set aside those feelings and move forward with your life. Its a great big adventure full of wonderful things, terrible things, boring days, and thrilling moments that will crystallize in your memory forever. Don't give that all up over coming out. Tomorrow just might surprise you.

She knew what I was trying to tell her but she made me actually say and like walked me through it telling me once its out its easier and just to go right out and tell her. It was so amazing saying it out loud to another person. We talked for a good hour or so and then she had to go home.

After I talked to her I texted my best friend and said I needed to talk to her and it had to be in person

After I got it out she let me direct the conversation not really asking too much and just letting me say how much I needed/wanted to say. It was so liberating to get this off my chest. We ended up going to her house to watch some previews of upcoming shows we like to watch that start in the fall (Vampire Diaries and Arrow) and a couple times she asked about my interest in the guys and it was awkward at first because I have NEVER openly expressed interest towards another guy in my life but it was so nice to finally be able to be myself with someone. I asked her not to tell anyone until I gave her the okay and she understood. I asked her if anyone has ever asked if I was gay and she said both her sister and mom have so it seems like it might be easier to come out to them other than my oblivious parents. Driving home I truly realized how much happier I already was. I just couldn't believe I am finally starting to take these steps.

Unfortunately he had to leave a day before I had, but he said goodbye in a way I will never forget. He went in for a hug, (what I had hoped for :) ), but he held on, and then burst into tears.

Enter now, quiet, young, gay freshman who I began talking to on **January 28**. He was given my number by one of my peers who thought I'd be uncomfortable about talking with a gay guy (Note: Everybody at my school thinks I'm straight). But as time passed I began talking more and more with this freshman, offering him advice, making jokes, getting closer to him; he actually asked me to be his valentine for fun since both of us had nobody.

And it was this past Sunday that he revealed he likes me and he asked me to give him a chance. In my heart I said yes, whereas the freshman just asked one question and I said ""Yes""...not directly to him...not yet at least.

Thursday rolled around (I was busy Monday, secluded, grassy area and sat by a tree near an elementary school. There I revealed to him that I'm not straight, I'm bi (but more leaning towards gay), and that I agree to out with him. The smile that grew on his face lit up my heart. Good god, if only that one girl knew about this, I bet her self-esteem would plummet and hit the ground just by the mere fact that I chose a guy over her (And dammit I made the right choice!). And so then time flies by and we cover so many topics, we embrace. We stand there, love

I’m in my early 20s and just got out of a 4-month relationship a few weeks ago. The relationship – while fun at first – had really begun to suck my soul in the last month. Basically

Throughout the time I knew him, my ex was neurotic/delusional &amp; I was/am extremely glad to be single &amp; free &amp; rediscovering my true self – unhindered by a 1-sided relationship with a self-absorbed asshole.

Fast forward to this past weekend. I – like every other single gay guy – am back on grindr, I said yes and asked how he knew me. He verified that he had, in fact, dated my ex, and that he had noticed that pictures of my ex and me had disappeared from my ex’s social networking profile. I playfully responded, “are you the pot-smoking child?” which sparked an interesting chain of events.

We messaged back and forth for about an hour until we finally exchanged phone numbers and continued the conversation via text. He told me his shift ended in soon and invited me over for dinner to chat. After consulting a trusted friend

Long story short, and we gossiped about our mutual ex &amp; got to know each other over the next few hours. Come to find out, he is a very mature &amp; cool individual [who turns out not to be a pothead] and seems to be one of the sweetest, most genuine guys I have ever met. We have already made plans to meet again very soon!

How common is it for someone’s exes to meet only to realize that they get along swimmingly &amp; have a lot in common [besides hating the mutual ex ;) ]?

1) Appearance. Dress well, ""I actually cared about you liking me."" Wear what works for your type but wear something nice; not your usual knock-around clothes. People notice footwear too. Even if you're a surfer bro, a good looking pair of nice flip flops beats those raggedy sneakers smelly enough to wander off of their own accord. But a nice shirt, pair of shoes, pants that aren't just holey blue jeans goes a long way. You want him to think, ""wow, he looks great, ""hey

2) Behavior. First, turn off your fucking phone. If you text during dinner may the gods set your fingers ablaze during the appetizer course! Thirdly, be a gentleman. You have no idea how hot this is to a lot of guys. When you see a hot guy, you want to do him. When you respect him, you want to marry him. Be the guy you'd look up to.

3) Eat and drink conservatively. No beans and you know why. Dont get stuffed so that going out afterwards sounds dreary. Eat light and fresh, maybe 2. But no one wants to date a lush so don't get smashed. You want him to compliment you on your hair -not hold it for you over the toilet.

4) Ask about him. One thing that turns me off on a date is when the conversation becomes a monologue from him about himself

5) Be the man. If you're going on a dinner date, just say, ""Ive got it. You can buy next time."" This is not only polite and a treat for him, it suggests you want a next time. Don't be that guy who stuffs his hands in his pockets when the bill comes and waits expectantly for a freebie.

6) Don't go home next. Suggest another activity after dinner, a museum, anything where you can go and have fun but still talk. Movies are silence in the dark and should only be a last resort.

7) No sex on the first date. No one wants to buy the cow when they get the milk for free. Cuddle. Kiss. Make out hardcore. But stop before the pants unbutton. Explain that you'd like to see him again and that you'd rather not spoil the first date. Most guys can handle that, that's fine but not the first or, as it tends to happen, there won't be a second. remember, you chose to go on an actual date. If you wanted a hookup instead that's what you should have been doing. What, brave comment-writer, you sexed up your man on the first date and now you're married with 17 adopted children and a dog? Awesome! Its not the norm, so I won't suggest it. Its not quite playing hard to get

8) Be a couple. Yes, I don't mean bring a suitcase and move in, arranging photos of your mom and dad on his mantle. I mean you can either mesh like the dynamic duo or be a pair of awkward mooks that just bump into each other. DO NOT talk about ""how hot that guy is."" Even if he's not in the room but just some movie star you like. You will instantly friendzone yourself. Keep it romantic and about each other. Compliment him a few times (do not be a slathering lap dog, just tell him he's cute for god's sake). The less you friendzone yourself the better.

9) Breathe. Fidgety dates can be cute

10) BE CONFIDENT. Nothing is so sexy as confidence. We all want a confident man to smile at us and pull us out of our shell. Take the initiative and be that man. Dont worry about what to do with your hands, move with purpose, draw him from his shell, and say what you mean. Its priceless.

So, its not big deal. Go on the date with an open mind and see what happens. But if he shows up late, texts throughout the meal, dresses like a bum, tells you he's lost his wallet when the bill arrives and gets trashed -don't bother with a second date.

But if he's hot,False,self,t5_2qhef,False,,GaFlair,t3_18zy34

Like total incapacitation, my brain is about to explode it hurts so much. I can't describe the feeling, but it is similar to gender dysphoria descriptions. I backed myself into a hole and feel like a trapped injured animal. I just want to crawl into some hole and cry until my eyes fall out. I need a hug. 

The Long Background (obviously shortened): 
I left my family when I was very young because I was gay and in total hiding from an extremely early age, to those who are gay. Growing up there were countless episodes of someone being discovered and things got messy real fast, some committed suicide, and other left after the whole community got embroiled in things. So. Many. Stories. Disgusting.  I learned to cover up real fast, really young. You just know you are different and even if I didn't exactly know what gay was or that I was gay I knew damn well that I was different in that environment, in a bad way. No tv or general pop culture so there wasn't any situations I could extrapolate or compare mine to. I grew up in shaking fear, and never came out, but there really were people all over including in the gay areas that would out you in a second). But, but well over 10 immediate siblings and I'm the oldest boy with a few older than me. I was missing on all sorts of life events, sex happened only like 4 times after the wedding and she wasn't into it at all so I tolerated it (lots of interesting stories here

Regardless, and many of our things resonate. I was there for him while he needed someone to lean on. He's a trans man and will be finally starting his testosterone soon. I am so excited for him. I am not looking to settle with him (i.e. that is not what is prompting me to get all ansty and dysphoric). I love him like a real brother not a sexual partner. He knows everything about me (although refuses to be around my wife for obvious reasons or my home because he knows the angst it causes me and my wife knows his name), and he has been a great listener while not always understanding my choices but knows just what to do when I tend to get close to snapping. I love kids, but really don't want to have kids with her. I want to be free. 

I want to be gay. I want to be openly gay. I want to love being gay. I want to not even think about the fact that I am gay. I just want to be me. I want to stop suppressing all my mannerism, love for art, love for music, love for life, love for genderqueer people and hot yummy gay men, I want to cook with gusto, and go to the pride parade, or approach a hot guy to chat when I see him at the gym or on the street, I want to suck a cock while moaning with it deep and finally play around enough to know if I am versatile or an exclusive top or bottom, I want to stop worrying about petty garbage and start living my life

Sniff...End cry. Thank you Reddit for your shoulder. I will now drop my head and go back to my miserable life which I created for myself.  ",self,t5_2qhef,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/taj7d/im_freaking_out_reddit_like_total_incapacitation/

1356060261.0,157g5k,I came out to my friends tonight. ,,42,7,6,"Hey gays everywhere sorry for the wall of text

Now this is the story all about how 
My life didn't get
And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there 
I'll tell you how I became the queen of a town called (wouldnt you like to know)

So there is a serious message after the Fresh Prince lyrics. I came out to my closest friends; about 10 guys. We are all part of a group that is tightly knit, and talk about conquests all the time, but in a light hearted way, so i posted on the fb thread that I had something to tell next time we met. We are all 20-21 and enjoy each others company and banter (especially the banter), especially after we are drinking. So tonight, when they steered the conversation through a drinking game at mine about my recent sexual exploits, I mentioned that I am gay, they found that me telling them first was very commendable

Later, we had a very frank discussion, he wanted to know how I knew, why I had decided, and when the group came together again out of a club and the certain moment had arisen, I said that I was so thankful for having such good friends that hadn't batted an eyelid to my remark. Many were inquisitive, and wanted to know why I had come out, before I was comfortable with my sexuality. They were overwhelmingly supportive, my friends have made me feel so, except that they have become more interested in my motivation and exploits. Its not only thrilling

I would like to say, so they could not have second guessed me. Also when I told them I was sober, so this is not down to alcohol consumption, for you doubters out there. I am incredibly lucky to have such a group of friends who are so happy with my orientation. When I told them, I felt so empowered, 1000 times more happy than I had before. I cant stop smiling, I am so happy. I have known for a while that I was gay, to tell my closest friends and for them to accept and endorse it

I know now that I am going to tell my parents in the New Year. They are deeply Catholic, whether it be a good response or bad, (it will be good), it will go on youtube to show the world how good it gets, and for people whom are struggling with these issues to empower themselves. 

I am sorry for this wall of text, and reiterates previous posts about how glad people feel after their sexual emancipation. I know its quite old to come out (20) but I felt it was the right time. There are a whole bunch of issues surrounding my family, least of all about inheritance, since I am the first born of the generation and male. I will keep you posted on my coming out to my mum with a link to youtube in the future, for those interested. Many thanks for taking the time out of your busy schedule to read my story. X

With the recent death of the co-owner of reddit a lot of his writings seem to have surfaced and I happened to see the one about him talking about how he is not gay

I feel like this is a common theme in many LGBT circles

I'm a person who thinks words are important, bisexual, and transexual are misplaced.  The problem is, and I agree, when the label becomes an identity.  In the context of the conversation that is going on the assumption is that these labels are identities, because after all they are merely attributes.  But of course with that said I am still gay categorically.  My identity is me as a whole, including the various attributes and the expression of those.  I am gay, rather a distinctive characteristic that I have.

I am bothered by people completely rejecting labels throughout, it is an attribute.

It is no different than saying that I have blue eyes.  We are all humans, some green, some red (Albino's anyone?).  We don't deny these exist, we just acknowledge the difference.  They are all eyes.

I hear that we need to start calling ourselves ""human"" or something like that: well of course we are all humans.  But with that said we are all humans with different attributes

I am just frustrated reading posts proposing being vague.  Words have a purpose and we need to use accurate and detailed words.

He knows his body pretty well, and we wait until at least 2 hours after his last bowel movement before doing anything. Does anyone have tips on how to make it less dirty? It's pretty unappealing, and the size of my urethra gives me concern for UTIs if we end up going bareback (after testing for STDs). Enemas are not out of the question, but we are frugal.

* I have bottomed for him several times as well, so I don't think it has to do with that, though I do have a small-ish frame, being 5' 10"" and weighing 140lb. Receiving is the weirdest disconnect for me, because even though I experience no conscious pleasure, I do remain hard and usually ejaculate pretty fiercely after the whole ordeal, telling me that my penis enjoyed it more than I did. Is this normal? Is there any way to perhaps make this experience more enjoyable for me?
* We frequently do oral, as I enjoy performing oral less right after I've ejaculated; and he enjoys it less (and his gag reflex acts up too) after he's just ejaculated. We've started taking turns on this and dealing with it in other ways. How do you deal with the post-orgasm lack of desire to continue sexy times?

I just want to get this off my chest and maybe some advice from those who can maybe relate. I feel terrible. I feel like I disappointed my friends and made them feel bad for something out of their control. 

I've been out of the closet for barely a year, I guess whatever it was that kept me smiling just failed on me. 

We were having our Cinco de Mayo dinner at a friends' place. Everything was great, a good friend, and the couple who owns the place who are also good friends of mine. Then good friend #1's girlfriend came over and we all talked and drank. I just kept telling myself ""Whatever, I'm with my best friends. I'm just enjoying the night"" Then another couple, of whom I am good friends with, came over and I just couldn't do it anymore.

I couldn't stay in a room full of my best friends who all happened to be  coupled up. I was a 7th wheel and everyone knew it. At that point

I've only been out to all of my friends for less than a year now

I've never intended to be as desperate as I probably sound like to you guys. I've always just let life happen and wholly been myself but I don't know anymore. Why does it have to be so difficult for me when it seems so easy for others? ",self,t5_2qhef,1367734515.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/1dpxz7/guys_im_a_mess/

Should i tell her and deal with the aftermath? or should I go about being a husband and father with a secret? I know that secrets and lies  are wrong

This whole situation makes me feel sick and I really just want to cry. Please help me.

So, and thought that since I joined the military, I'd have to hide that part of myself and continue playing straight. However, with the repeal of DADT and other anti-harassment organizations, I felt that my colleges would be accepting and supportive of my sexuality (unlike my friends from back home), and came out. In my experience so far, it's been great!

I am just arriving at my first duty station in Alabama. I'm pretty open about being gay, and I don't want to seem like I'm parading myself for attention or anything. My real concern is LGBT support in Alabama- actually, the lack of. 

Does anyone have any ways to find a supportive LGBT community in a state that largely opposes the lifestyle? I'm scared about trying to meet people or find things to do, and I've only met 1 other gay person (who was 30 years older than me). It's a pretty small base, so I'm pretty confident I make up 50% of the gay population here...

I've checked into local LGBT Pride websites

We chatted for a while through email and decided to go to the famous gay district of Tokyo. We wind up in the basement in the picture. It was called ""The boiler room underwear lounge."" and I didn't really know what it was because as you can see it looks like a utility room. So I open the door and go in and it's a dark room full of men in their underwear. They stop and just stare at me because I'm the only non-Asian and I'm way overdressed. Suddenly I realize that this means I have to get into my underwear too and it's too late to back out but all I'm wearing is a thong. Also I just shaved my legs smooth. So I strip in front of them and it's like dangling meat in front of lions. They just can't take their eyes off of me. Even the DJ and both bar tenders stopped. My dom puts his hand on the small of my back and pushes me up the small metal staircase to the loft overlooking the lounge and we sit down on one of the couches up there. They were still staring every step I took up the stairs and immediately 6 Japanese guys come up and just start hovering around. Two of them start touching on the couch next to me and this guy with a mohawk and really toned muscles is giving another guy a blowjob. He was really going to town giving his full effort. Another one sits down next to me and starts touching my leg. My dom takes his hand and puts it on my balls and he starts stroking me through my underwear. Now I had two men, I had to use just my index finger and thumb to stroke him, but he seems to lose face in the heat of the moment. It's confusing as hell for me too because I actually felt powerful and like I wanted to control him and the other Japanese boys that were there

OK

Click here to take part.

The Senate inquiry received more submissions than any other in history, and while most support ending marriage discrimination, the Australian Christian Lobby and others are asking conservative voices to flood the survey. The official results will be considered in Parliament, so it's obviously important that we speak up for equality.

http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees

Oh

Basically, and his bill was introduced to reflect the change in ALP party policy at the end of last year - policy which now supports marriage equality! Mr Bandt is a Greens MP and his bill, which is co-sponsored by Independent MP Andrew Wilkie, has a similar effect but includes additional language to ensure religious ministers will not be obliged to perform same-sex marriages.

Other than that

Well. Around a month in

Time passed and I was still friends with my Ex- but I noticed my feelings that had died down for him started growing again. This went on for some time until one day he blatantly told me ""I still like you."" I was taken back because I thought he had gotten over me. In actuality

And from there, all the students are is just a source of high API scores so that we stay open. Nothing more.)

I didn't give the warning much thought. I continued. Especially one day after school where I went with my boyfriend to go sit by a tree near the parking lot of the school, just taking in the moment. I buried my face in his neck. Just as we saw his car in the distance and as he was going to get up, I hold him down and we look at each other straight in the eyes and before we know it, our lips are locked.

On the last day of school (Just this past Thursday for me), and light gray gym shorts that defined his cute little ass. My heart fluttered. He crawled onto his bed and told me to sit lay down next to him.

I obviously complied. So I got next to him and he cuddles with me as we go on his ipod, and mess around. I won't lie, I got hard. And he knew it. When he would put something on his ipod for me to see, he would turn over on his other side, poke out his ass a bit, and say ""Tell me when you're done."" I'd finish whatever it was, then press up against him from behind and spoon with him. He would actually rhythmically move his hips and I'd go with his motion. I knew he got hard from it because he put a pillow in between his legs to cover his junk. 

His parents came home, as he moves his hands all around my neck, shoulders, shoulder blades, back, and hips as if he can't believe that I'm there. I say to him ""Yes...yes...I'm here. Dont worry. You don't have to keep feeling to make sure. I'm here....I'll always be here."" He held me even tighter, I don't think he would ever let go had his dad not call him for something

When he let go, kissing each other, both of us hard, he moves his hands all around my back again and even down to my ass. I move a hand up to the back of his head and use my fingers to grab and mess with his hair. And with just perfect timing as you'd expect in a movie, when we stop, his dad calls him again. He gets up to go and sit there, smiling

About two weeks after switching schools, he'd be looking back at me too, and I know this can be accidental but it felt as if something was there. I decided to ask one of his very close friends if he had any dating history, explaining that I was gay and interested in him, and she said that although she was under the impression he was straight, he'd never dated anyone and only spoke very rarely here or there about liking any girls.

I try not to read into stereotypes because I know I myself am I prime example of how they can be very misleading, or hanging out with groups of girls at night at one of their homes, even though according to his good friend he wasn't interested in any of them. I know this isn't necessarily indicative of sexuality, but I couldn't help but take note of the fact that he has a very abnormal level of platonic comfort with an entourage of girls and no guy friends whom are on a similar level.

As the weeks have gone on, there've been other very positive signs. When hanging out in groups, whenever I'd say anything I'd always notice his head turn so that he'd be looking right at me and got the sense that he was intently listening to every word I said. He'd laugh and smile at things I'd say even if they weren't that funny, and a couple of times when one of his friends would talk about him in front of me he'd smile, get very red in the face and look away as if he wasn't listening.

For some reason I felt different about him. In the past with these situations there was always a sense of doubt or risk, which is a new feeling for me. I was ready to slowly start breaching the topic of me being gay to see how he'd react until about last Friday. We were hanging out afterschool in a group talking about the softball team, when someone said ""isn't that girl x from y school on the team?"", and he turned to one of our mutual friends and quietly, so that only the two of them were supposed to hear, ""isn't she the one who's supposed to be super hot?"". In response, our friend somewhat louder said, to which he quickly said ""shhhh don't talk so loudly"" and ended the conversation.

Also, he seemed very flustered, surprised and caught off guard, and gave a very hesitant answer as if he was somewhat weirded out by the news.

Up until this point, but don't know if I should stick with it or give up prematurely to avoid the risk of ending up more hurt in the long run.

That night he calls me and I tell him what happens. He tells me that he was drunk and that it wasn't him. I tell him it was still his mouth that said it and that it pissed me off.

I answer back that I am too so we start talking a little bit about this. Keep in mind this is the first real conversation I've ever had with anyone on chatroulette. I start talking about what it's like over where I live

But he talks about the outskirts of houston and how it's completely the opposite there. By this time we've sort of got to know each other a little bit so he quietly says, ""haha man, no judgement."" 

He tells me he's never confessed that to ANYONE

He's mind blown by this, ""hey man, I'm all ears."" So because he doesn't want to say it, he types,
""I'm bi
and i can't even say that."" 

By this time things are getting pretty emotional. I'm shaking and I think he might be too. He can't believe he has never said this to anyone, I tell him how i care about him. 

So we talk about that and I tell him about my coming out story and how good it was. He tells me how his dad has Alzheimer's and his mind is still stuck in the 1930's when they would hang blacks and gays. After a few more hours talking

Basically to end it all, even if in a small way. And I still can't believe this happened. And it all started by being bored on a sunday night on chatroulette. 

TL;DR I go on chatroulette for the first time not expecting much. After two hours come across this guy and start talking. He ends up coming out to me,False,self,t5_2qhef,1343714045.0,,,t3_xeems
