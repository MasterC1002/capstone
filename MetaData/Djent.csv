Square preview: http://i.imgur.com/CmCzFao.jpg

I have created this artwork that I think would be cool for an album cover / theme for an album

The artwork currently says 'STORIES' just because it's a nice word to work with and I happened to be listening to the band Stories as I was working on the lettering

I don't mind too much what genre of music the artist/band that uses the artwork is, /r/progmetal and /r/postrock, purely due to preference of taste. 

Everything in the image that I didn't either create myself or photograph myself was copyright free

I guess if you are interested drop me a private message. Also if anyone knows anywhere else I could try posting this I would be very thankful. I am fully aware that this isn't really the correct order to create artwork but still. 

Thanks for your time! 

UPDATE: I have found a good home for the artwork, if anyone needs any artwork for their stuff feel free to send me a pm. ",,False,self,t5_2s8xc,1365857852.0,,

1355689952.0,14yelg,r/Djent Top 10 Albums and EPs of 2012 ,djent_illini,49,6,131,"Hi everyone

Let's vote on the top 10 albums and EPs of 2012. I think full length albums and EPs should be in different categories since there were many great albums and EPs out this year. So there will be two Top 10 lists to make the list fair.

I will use *chris-music's* voting system from last year as it worked well.

**How it works:**

* **ctrl+f** to find the album you like; upvote it. You can upvote as many as you like. Downvotes will not be counted.

* If it is not there

* If you are not sure if the band is djent

*example*:

Band - [Album](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqLPb0_ygKk)

*Progressive Metal*

**Finally:**

* Reply to the comments about why you think the album was good or not.

* If you have not heard majority of the bands on this thread

*All the Sumerian Records bands are not on my playlist so Youtube them!*

**Voting will end close to the New Year so there is plenty of time!**

""Hey guys. 
We've got some pretty terrible news to report. Upon returning home to our house in LA we discovered that we'd been robbed while were out on tour. The thieves were able to get away with Javier's Chevy Blazer and all of the equipment we didn't have on tour with us. 10 guitars in total. This includes many of our one of a kind custom instruments (Stranberg
This is beyond devastating. We know so many of you have been beyond supportive with Javier's legal troubles. We may need more of your help now to potentially find some of these one of a kind instruments that may pop up on Ebay, used music stores etc. 
We're adding an album containing photos and detailed descriptions of the stolen gear to our profile. Please take a look and keep your eyes open for anything that looks close to this stuff. I truly think that with your help we have an exponentially better chance of tracking some of this down. 

Thanks

Before I caught onto Progressive Metal, Dissection (More Black Metal), and The Haunted. I found Dark Tranquility a little bit too electronic for my tastes, although a lot of it is pretty sweet still.

Two of my favorite Haunted tracks; I love their tone. It's so gritty and full.

* [The Fallout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B_EzXRh1sE)
* [All Against All](http://www.youtube.co/watch?v=H7I_P2QsTyU)

I'm sure a lot of you have heard of In Flames

* [The Quiet Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9PL4Xy4wrk)

I also really dig Opeth. If you guys don't listen to Opeth you're seriously missing out. Not only do they have some of the best Progressive metal riffs to offer

In celebration of our 800th member population for this page, as for now I'd like to just name two;

- Some people were asking for a change in the sidebar definition of ""Djent"". Do you guys find it accurate? If you would change it how would you?
- I was thinking of doing some sort of ""album discussion of the month/term"" or something like just so we could have an organized structure on album reviews/comments that we all had about big time albums.

Again

Anyway
