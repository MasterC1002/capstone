1367210476.0,1dbi5u,[Suggestion] Airing Anime [Spring 2013],JBHUTT09,56,6,30,"I'm sorry this is so late and incomplete. I've been very busy with college as the semester is coming to a close. I'll try and finish what I haven't yet completed within the next few days. Here's what I have so far:

***

As you all probably know

* **[Attack on Titan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin):** Attack on Titan is amazing so far. It's set in a world where humans live in fear of giant human-like creatures called ""Titans"". Humanity lives behing three massive walls designed to keep the Titans out. However, and the story is interesting. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes action shows in a despairing setting.

* **[Hataraku Maou-sama!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15809/Hataraku_Maou-sama!):** Hataraku Maou-sama! is currently my favorite show airing. It is about the Demon Lord Sadao who is forced to flee to another world in order to escape the hero Emilia. What world does he end up in? Modern Tokyo. Hilarity ensues. The language barrier and lack of money make things hard for him and his General, guess who... Emilia suddenly appears before them. Things get really complicated. It's a great show. The comedy is top notch, the characters are great in their interactions and development, and the premise itself is beyond amazing. I've given it a 10/10 on MAL. I highly recommend everyone check it out.

* **[Yuyushiki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15911/Yuyushiki):** Yuyushiki is one of my favorites this season. It's a light-hearted comedy centered around 3 freshmen girls in highschool. If I had to describe it I'd call it a cross between [Nichijou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10165/Nichijou) and [A-Channel](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9776/A-Channel). It's really funny and really relaxing. I can't recommend it enough!

* **[Aiura](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17082/Aiura):** A short SoL centered around three girls. Since it's a short (only 5 mins per episode). After two episodes I can say that I really like it. It's cute, once again, of [A-Channel](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9776/A-Channel) and a bit of [Yama no Susume](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14355/Yama_no_Susume). Great little show to just watch and unwind.

* **[Suisei no Gargantia](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16524/Suisei_no_Gargantia):** Gargantia is incredible so far. I'm not exactly sure how to describe it. The main character ends up stranded on Earth, the characters are well done, and the writing is amazing. I can't recommend this show enough and my little blurb here is not doing it justice at all.

* **[Toaru Kagaku no Railgun S](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16049/Toaru_Kagaku_no_Railgun_S):** I'm not going to say much about Railgun because since it's the fourth season of the Toaru Series it's most likely that everyone who would watch it already is. Basically, from Misaka's point of view. Having read the manga I can say that this arc is awesome. I can't wait for The Railgun v.s. The Meltdowner! So far it's been about as good an adaptation as the first season of Railgun. it has filler but it doesn't interfere with the canon material. If you're not familiar with the Toaru Series I highly recommend it. I'd recommend watching the series in this order:
 1. [Toaru Majutsu no Index](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4654/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index)
 2. [Toaru Kagaku no Railgun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6213/Toaru_Kagaku_no_Railgun) (Spin-off prequel to Index)
 3. [Toaru Majutsu no Index](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8937/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index_II) (Sequel to Index)
 4. [Toaru Kagaku no Railgun S](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16049/Toaru_Kagaku_no_Railgun_S)

     It's an incredibly fun series that builds a complex and complete world full of interesting characters. [Here is an AMV](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B88Fws5MEPs) I made to give people a feel for the show. I also highly recommend reading the [Index light novels](http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index#The_Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index_series) after watch the series.

* **[Namiuchigiwa no Muromi-san](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16910/Namiuchigiwa_no_Muromi-san):** A short about a mermaid named Muromi. It's very similar to [Senyuu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15751/Senyuu.) with its ridiculous comedy mixed with some pretty awesome battle scenes.

* **[Date A Live](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15583/Date_A_Live):** Date A Live is a parody (or at least I hope it's a parody) of your typical dating sim game. For the past 30 years Earth has been plagued by strange phenomena known as ""spacequakes"". These ""spacequakes"" completely obliterate anything in the immediate area and cause major damage to the surrounding areas. They're caused by spirits coming to Earth. Now, because that's the plan. It's hilarious, the art is great, the characters are good, and the story is interesting to say the least. The premise actually reminds me a bit of [The World God Only Knows](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8525/Kami_nomi_zo_Shiru_Sekai), but it's not as good so far. It's nothing groundbreaking but it's a fun watch.

* **[Kakumeiki Valvrave](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16668/Kakumeiki_Valvrave):** Valvrave is one of you ""mecha series with a twist"". I'm not going to go into what the twist is because I don't want to spoil it even though you find it out in the first two episodes. What I will say is that this show is good. It has great art, based on the end of the third episode the ""antagonist"" just became really *really* interesting. I can't wait for more of this to come out. Anyone who likes mechas, hell even those who don't (the twist may be enough to keep you interested), should check out Valvrave.

* **[Hentai Ouji no Warawanai Neko](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15225/Hentai_Ouji_to_Warawanai_Neko.):** This show is funny and well written so far. Basically it's your typical ""be careful what you wish for"" story. In an attempt to make their lives easier the main characters end up making them hundreds of times more difficult as they completely lose their ability to effectively interact with others. People who like drama comedies will like HenNeko.

* **[Photokano](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16397/Photokano):** Photokano is another SoL show. I have to say I'm not very impressed by it so far. It's about a boy who gets a camera from his father and begins photographing things (mostly girls at school). So far it seems to be a generic school anime with your usual mix of cliched character types and fanservice. There hasn't really been much character development in the first three episodes and that's not usually a good sign. I'm finding it relatively enjoyable but it's nothing special.

* **[Ginga Kikoutai Majestic Prince](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15863/Ginga_Kikoutai_Majestic_Prince):** Like mechas? You'll probably enjoy Majestic Prince. Hate mechas? This isn't the show for you. Nothing quite special about MJP but it's enjoyable for mecha fans. Plus Sawashiro Miyuki is always a good reason to watch something. The art is so-so. The mechas are pretty cool but the characters themselves are a bit lacking

* **[Aku no Hana](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16201/Aku_no_Hana):** After the first episode this show was about the seventh lowest rated shows on MAL. Why? Because people hated the animation because it was ""ugly"". Ako no Hana is rotoscope animation. This means it was filmed live-action and then animated based on the film. I personally don't love this style but it shouldn't be condemned because of it. It fits with the show's dark atmosphere. The plot is rather interesting. The MC

* **[Arata Kangatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16518/Arata_Kangatari):** A bullied highschooler with no friends and a boy from another world who has been framed for murder. What connection could these two possibly have? Well, and I like the story so far.

* **[Mushibugyou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17505/Mushibugyou):** This is a show about a samurai in ancient Japan who joins a group dedicated to protecting people from the giant man-eating insects that appeared 100 years earlier. In the first discussion thread over in /r/anime someone described Mushibugyou as ""So shounen it hurts"". I'm inclined to agree with this

* **[Karneval](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16035/Karneval_(TV):** Karneval feels to me like a cross between [Pandora Hearts](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5530/Pandora_Hearts) and [[K]](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14467/K). The character designs are really cool

***

Very brief opinion of shows I haven't gotten around to writing up:

* **[Devil Survivor 2 The Animation](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16512/Devil_Survivor_2_The_Animation):** Adaptation of the game of the same name. It's from the same series as the Persona games. I'm liking it quite a bit.

* **[Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16355/Dansai_Bunri_no_Crime_Edge):** Very original

* **[OreImo S2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13659/Ore_no_Imouto_ga_Konnani_Kawaii_Wake_ga_Nai.):** Second season of OreImo.

* **[Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14813/Yahari_Ore_no_Seishun_Love_Come_wa_Machigatteiru.):** Comedy with your typical cynical MC. Good so far. Pretty funny.

* **[Zettai Bouei Leviathan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17681/Zettai_Bouei_Leviathan):** Ok so far. Not too special. Nice art.

The cast

The show's premise might remind you of Minority Report and Gattaca, it is way better than any of these movies.

The films strong points are the characters. They actually seem like high school kids and not their caricatures.

You could meet these people everyday and not notice anything weird about them.

Be smart and don't read the entire ""plot"" section because wikipedia does not hide spoilers. Read the first few sentances of the plot to get the gist of the anime.

* [Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist#Fullmetal_Alchemist:_Brotherhood) This is an amazing mix of science and magic that explores the concept of Alchemy: the process of deconstructing matter and reconstructing it into a different form, compound, or state of matter. The laws of alchemy must strictly adhere to the law that matter cannot be created or destroyed. The story follows Edward Elric: a young alchemist working for the military who is trying to find a way to restore his brother's body, which was taken when the two tried to use alchemy to transmute a human being. Anime is around 60 episodes.

* [Angel Beats:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Beats!) A shorter anime that takes place in a purgatory-ish world. The story follows a group of deceased high-school kids (specifically a boy named Otonashi

* [Death Note:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note) This story follows Light Yagami, soon learns that the Death Note can be used by humans, and, under the alias ""Kira"", uses it to try to rid the world of evil. This is a great anime for fans of something a bit darker and supernatural. It is very dialogue-driven and it is very interesting to observe Light planning his actions 3 moves ahead of his opponents. the anime is about 40 episodes.

* [Clannad:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clannad_(visual_novel) This series begins very slowly as a cute high-school comedy/romance with a minor paranormal background. The first half of the first season can be very slow, and both have an OVA.

* [Spirited Away:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away) not a series

* [Soul Eater:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Eater_(manga)) a less serious anime that still has a pretty good plot. The story follows 7 students at the DWMA, at which point the weapon will be considered worthy of use by Lord Death himself. The art style in this series is great, and the series is consistently funny. The only downside is that the ending really isn't too good. The anime is about 50 episodes

* [Samurai Champloo:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai_Champloo) This series lacks the supernatural elements that the other anime in this list have, influence of modern day hip-hop themes, which go surprisingly well with the anime's setting. The story follows Mugen and Jin, two incredibly skilled samurai with fighting styles and personalities that are polar opposites of each other. The two become indebted to a 15 year-old girl named Fuu, who makes them act as bodyguards for her as they journey to find a ""Samurai who smells of sunflowers."" The anime is 26 episodes, with a few of them being filler episodes intended to present alternative fictional origin stories of japanese culture (for example: a made up account of the introduction of baseball to japan).

* [Kaze No Stigma:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaze_no_Stigma) An anime focusing heavily on the concept of elemental magic. Great choice for anyone who enjoyed Avatar: The Last Airbender. The story follows a wind magic user who is disowned by his family because of his inability to use fire magic The series is 24 episodes and focuses heavily on the spirit world and the elements.

* [Cowboy Bebop:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop) Cowboys in space? This series is a Western and Sci-Fi blend that is accompanied with a jazz soundtrack. The story follows Spike Spiegel, Jet. Along the way they meet some interesting folks and get into tough situations when claiming bounties. The anime is 26 episodes long. *Thanks to /u/KrazyKomrade for contributing!*

* [Full Metal Panic!:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Metal_Panic!)In short it's a 'boy meets girl' type of story with the twist that the boy is a child soldier who is almost completely incapable of acting 'normally'. Add in some international espionage and giant robots and you have Full Metal Panic! It has 3 seasons with the first clocking in at 24 episodes and the other 2 clocking in at 12-13 episodes. The mecha action is pretty good

* [Sword Art Online:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Art_Online) Anime based on a series of light novels. The story revolves around a teenager boy named Kirito who has rejected the real world and spends his time playing a VRMMORPG (Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) called Sword Art Online using a helmet called the NerveGear. One day he finds out that he and other players find out that they cannot log out of the game and must beat the game in order to log out and take the helmet off safely. Anyone who dies inside the game dies in real life. The anime is 25 episodes long and is split into two arcs each containing a separate game. Enjoyable for anyone that likes to play games or wants to see a decent action/romance combination. *Thanks to /u/LolCakeLazors for contributing!*

* [AnoHana:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anohana:_The_Flower_We_Saw_That_Day) A short, Jinta, rejects society and spends his life inside his house. Jinta soon finds that he can see the spirit of Menma who wishes to get the group of friends back together. Has a great cast of likable characters. Recommended for anyone that enjoyed Angel Beats or Clannad. **Note:**This isn't available in english, only Japanese with english subtitles *Thanks to /u/LolCakeLazors for contributing!*

* [High School of the Dead:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highschool_of_the_Dead) **WARNING: NSFW** This anime is set in a zombie apocalypse, and a young girl as they fight their way to safety through the deadly streets of Japan during the worldwide catastrophic event known as the ""Outbreak"". As the cast tries to survive the zombie apocalypse, they must also face the additional threats of societal collapse, in the form of dangerous fellow survivors, and the possible decay of their own moral codes. This anime is 12 episodes long. **WARNING:** This anime contains tons of nudity. Additionally, almost every other camera angle is an upskirt. The majority of anime are not this sexually explicit. Not reccomended if you are uncomfortable with cartoon boobies and upskirts distracting you from the actual story. If you're into that stuff, by all means watch for the boobies

* [Mushishi: ""Mushi"":](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushishi) the most basic forms of life in the world. They exist without any goals or purposes aside from simply ""being."" They are beyond the shackles of the words ""good"" and ""evil"". This is, as to even call them a form of life would be an oversimplification. Detailed information on Mushi is scarce because the majority of humans are unaware of their existence. So what are Mushi and why do they exist? This is the question that a ""Mushi-shi"", Ginko, ponders constantly. Mushi-shi are those who research Mushi in hopes of understanding their place in the world's hierarchy of life. Ginko chases rumors of occurrences that could be tied to Mushi, all for the sake of finding an answer. A series of 24 stand alone episodes that follow Ginko's travels and experiences, Mushishi is a beautiful and slow paced show that provides a very relaxing feeling. *Thanks to /u/JBHUTT09 for contributing!*

* [FLCL:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fooly_Cooly) Fooly Cooly FLCL revolves around Naota Nandaba, who runs over Naota with her Vespa scooter, gives him CPR, then hits him on the head with a blue vintage Rickenbacker 4001 left-handed electric bass guitar. Naota discovers that the blow to his head created an ""N.O."" portal, from which giant robots produced by a company known as Medical Mechanica emerge periodically. *Thanks to /u/sexyagentdingdong for contributing!*

* [Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Geass) The series is set in an alternative timeline where the world is split into three superpowers, and the European Union. The story takes place after the Holy Britannian Empire's conquest on Japan in August 10, 2010 a.t.b., by means of Britannia's newest weapon, the ""Autonomous Armored Knight"", or Knightmare Frame. In turn, Britannia effectively strips Japan and its citizens of all rights and freedoms and renames the country Area 11 with its citizens referred to as Elevens.
Lelouch Lamperouge, along with his sister Nunnally Lamperouge, by his father, Emperor Charles zi Britannia, after his mother, Marianne vi Britannia, was murdered. When Marianne was murdered, Lelouch gets caught up in a terrorist attack and finds a girl called C.C. (C2), whether bending their will to live, Nunnally. Lelouch in the process becomes the leader of the resistance movement known as The Black Knights under the alter-ego Zero

* Hunter x hunter (2011): A boy called Gon decided to become a Hunter to search for his missing father, that tests strength but also fast thinking and strategy. Hunters are a elite group that travels the world doing dangerous tasks and have permission to enter special areas and have access to a huge information network.

If anyone else has some good suggestions, feel free to explain why in the comments.

*Note:* Remember that anime, definitely google a summary AFTER you finish the series.




EDIT: grammar, added Cowboy Bebop, added Full Metal Panic!, added Sword Art Online, added AnoHana

EDIT 2: I'm considering adding **Highschool of the Dead** to this list. The reason being that its a short anime, which is very western. I'm hesitating because of the amount of upskirts, cleavage, full-frontal nudity, bouncing titties, boob grabbing, full-rear nudity, naked females in a bathtub together

EDIT 3: Fuck it

Edit 4: Added FLCL

Also, I had time to do all that because it was a slow work day. Now that its the weekend I won't be able to add things to the list as efficiantly. Thanks!

You will probably like it if you like other Mamoru Oshii's movies like Jin-Roh, Gibson's novels, Egan's diaspora and The Matrix live action movie.",ownworldman,6, smart story on a grand scale with gorgeous [art](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18lja1vhqwc3cjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg) and [breathtaking music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z64HCi2rQkE&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=890s).

It is not subtle

The movie has 2004 sequel called [Ghost in the Shell: Innocence](http://myanimelist.net/anime/468/Ghost_in_the_Shell_2:_Innocence). It split the fans of the show

There is a digital retouch [Ghost in the Shell 2.0](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4672/Ghost_in_the_Shell_2.0) that you can skip. It is redundant like coloring Twelve Angry Men to feel more modern. The original classic animation is awesome

1350250823.0,11h905,[Suggestion] Airing Anime,JBHUTT09,32,8,25,"As I'm sure many of you know

Here are the currently airing shows that I'd highly recommend

* ***FINISHED*** [BTOOOM!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14345/Btooom!) BTOOOM! is similar to [Sword Art Online](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online) and [Accel World](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11759/Accel_World). In fact

* ***FINISHED*** [**Busou Shinki**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14237/Busou_Shinki) If I had to describe Busou Shinki I would compare it to Pokemon with the difference being that instead of monster-like creatures

* ***FINISHED*** [Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14741/Chuunibyou_demo_Koi_ga_Shitai!) Now this one kind of angered me at first. I was all set to watch [this show](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YdYdaYBHzo) but instead I got a painfully funny slice-of-life. I still enjoy it and plan to continue it but I felt a bit cheated. KyoAni really got me good with that one. Anyway

* ***FINISHED*** **[CØDE:BREAKER](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11703/Code:Breaker)** CØDE:BREAKER addresses the issue of whether 'evil' people should be killed as punishment for the public good. The main character encounters an eliminator who can burn anything out of existence with a touch of his left hand. She swears to follow him to try to prevent him from killing anyone as she doesn't believe what he is doing is justified. At the same time an even greater conflict begins. It's very interesting and I highly recommend it.

* [Ixion Saga DT](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14765/Ixion_Saga_DT) Now I just watched the first episode this morning without any preconceived notions about the show. I saw it on commiesubs' torrent page and though ""Ahn

* ***FINISHED*** [K](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14467/K) K seems to be the high production show of this season. Similar in appearance to [Guilty Crown](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10793/Guilty_Crown), and the seemingly aloof and goofy but ultimately cool and calculating MC of [Trigun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6/Trigun), K is a unique project. Because the first episode is largely serious and the second episode is more of a comedy, it's unclear of what this show really wants to be. The only thing I'm sure of at this point is that it'll be a fun watch. Anyone who wants beautiful artwork and music should check it out as well.

* [Little Busters!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13655/Little_Busters!) Based on an extremely popular VN that I've never heard of

* [Magi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14513/Magi) A new take on the Arabian Nights story. Don't know what else to say besides it's pretty and fun.

* ***FINISHED*** [**Medaka Box Abnormal**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14527/Medaka_Box_Abnormal) Now I have not watched MBA yet but I have just started the first season

* [Psycho-Pass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13601/Psycho-Pass) Now this show looks like it's gonna be one hell of a ride. A very Orwellian setting where even your thoughts could land you in ""rehabilitation"" and if the scanning system doesn't think you're worth the trouble? Well

* [Robotics;Notes](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13599/Robotics;Notes) This one is an alternative setting to ChaoS;Head and Steins;Gate (the very first thing you see is a world line number). This means that it takes place in the same universe but has nothing to do with the events of the other two. The premise is pretty interesting. A high school robotics club is attempting to recreate a giant mecha from a popular anime for a robotics expo. Based on the ending scene of the first episode something strange is about to happen and shit may or may not hit the fan. If you liked the other semicolon series you should check this one out. It has nice animation and character designs as well as an awesome opening song.

* [Sakurasao no Pet na Kanjou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13759/Sakurasou_no_Pet_na_Kanojo) Now since I am currently attending a liberal arts college in order to get a computer science degree

* [Shinsekai Yori](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori) From the New World is quickly becoming my favorite all time anime (a spot previously held by [Ano Natsu de Matteru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11433/Ano_Natsu_de_Matteru) for reasons unknown even to me). This show is overflowing with a deep sense of despair the likes of which I've never felt before. As I watched the first few episodes it felt as though someone was kneeling on my chest

* ***FINISHED*** [**Sukitte Ii na yo**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14289/Sukitte_Ii_na_yo.) 'Say ""I love you""' is a high school romance drama. There is nothing out of the ordinary and no silly shenanigans. I think the reason this show is so good is because it's so normal. It's just a story about two teens who are new to love trying to figure out just what it is they are doing. I'm really enjoying it and anyone who likes romances should check it out.

* ***FINISHED*** [Sword Art Online](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online) This has been airing since July so not much really needs to be said about it I don't think. It's very good and everyone should give it a chance.

* ***FINISHED*** [Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14227/Tonari_no_Kaibutsu-kun) A slice-of-life romcom. Pretty funny and very nice artwork. Anyone who wants to laugh should watch it.

* **[Zetsuen no Tempest: The Civilization Blaster](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14075/Zetsuen_no_Tempest)** If you like Accelerator from Toaru Majutsu no Index you're gonna love the co-MC of this show. Same insanity, with nothing but a few talismans and the instruction of the world's most powerful mage (who currently has been stranded on a deserted island), Zetsuen no Tempest promises to be thrilling.

And that's all I have. I wrote this massive post in part because I like helping people find things they might like

I saw the anime first and it is very good with great [soundtrack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_zuLGYzd-U). They left out some more disturbing parts of manga, which is shame. Manga also wins in bluntness of the message and despair. I did not read the light novels but I really want to.

This show's pastel art style is unique and lends a hand to all the craziness of the show itself making it that much more believable... but making it all that much more surreal. The music for the show throughout always fits and never is out of place and the antics of the fairies and the voices they have makes everything they do all the more comedic. The heroine of the story constantly playing the straight man to the other character and the army of fairies she looks over

This show isn't without any actual meaning however; it is in fact fairly interesting due to the fairies being a caricature of humanities current unsustainable personalities or how we are so easily lead into consumerism there's quite a few of these and looking out for them and noticing it can increase the enjoy-ability. The social commentary is quite damning to the way we act and in the show usually ends up with the fairies abandoning ship for greener pastures. Whether you care for this is another subject but if you do like this sort of social commentary then it can only be a plus.  

Overall the show is a bit off its rocker. I haven't even mentioned the bread

Anyway

1361890623.0,199eg5,Searious anime for adults,MrSchnieke,25,3,56,"So I was wondering if there are serious anime that are aimed for adults. By that I do not want to hear Steins;Gate eventhough those kind of anime are great they are not what I am looking for.

To give you a couple more hints of what I am looking for:

- it should contain a serious topic (I know this one isn't hard)

- it should contain interesting characters (an awesome example would be Hisoka who is the creepiest motherfucker on earth but I wouldn't say Hunter X Hunter is what I am looking for either)

- It should be a little gruesome like Elfenlied (not that I am looking for a splatter I would prefer a non splatter but storywise it was pretty dark/mature and this was supported by the brutallity which shouldn't be the main topic though)

-I don't care about nudity

I hope you get a rough idea of what I am looking for.. I think Monster (not watched yet) would be the anime to watch because it seems to me to be rather dark. And if your suggestion doesn't fit this completely I still want you to post it.

1358055202.0,16h8pb,[Suggestion] Airing Anime Winter 2013,JBHUTT09,23,2,8,"I made a [thread of airing anime](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/11h905/suggestion_airing_anime/) in the fall because I was bored and really didn't want to work on an essay and it was a huge hit so I figured I'd make it a regular thing. This post contains brief descriptions of all the original anime (by original I mean not sequels

* **[Ai Mai Mi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16169/Ai_Mai_Mi)** Ai Mai Mi is a comedic short (3 min per episode) about three girls who draw manga... or at least that's what they're *supposed* to be doing. It's fairly funny and the art is definitely different

* **[AMESIA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15085/Amnesia)** I really like AMNESIA based on the first episode. The premise is simple enough: A girl suddenly becomes self-aware and realizes she has no memories at all. A spirit named Orion informs her that her amnesia is a result of his screw up and that he intends to help her regain her memories. The catch is that for her to regain her memories she must interact with people. This means she can't let anyone know she has amnesia or she'll risk being confined to a hospital where her memory will continue to degrade. The art is really nice (I'd say it looks like a cross between [Pandora Hearts](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5530/Pandora_Hearts) and [[K]](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14467/K) and the opening is an instant favorite of mine. It's a bit confusing but I feel like that is on purpose to allow the viewer to sympathize with the Heroine's confusion. [ChäoS;HEAd](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4975/Ch%C3%A4oS;HEAd) did something very similar. I have very high hopes for this show and recommend it to anyone who likes psychological anime.

* **[Cuticle Tantei Inaba](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15109/Cuticle_Tantei_Inaba)** Cuticle Detective Inaba is... strange. Inaba is a werewolf detective who can track down people using a single strand of their hair and also gain different powers from different types of hair. He's also searching for his missing brother and trusting to a fault. Don't give up after only the first episode. The second one's humor feels much more natural and the pacing is much better as well. The comedy is beyond ridiculous and leaves you wondering ""What did I just watch?... And why did I like it?"" It moves very quickly and the humor is very out there. I'd compare it to [Joshiraku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12679/Joshiraku) but with more physical comedy. Also [Azusa](http://i.imgur.com/I1QAy.gif) is the cutest thing I have ever seen! I want one so badly!

* **[GJ-bu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14811/GJ-bu)** Good Job Club is another strange show. It seems to be a mash-up of many successful female protagonists from other shows and your average straight-man male. Though it's a bit formulaic I still enjoyed it. It's quite a bit of fun and just a nice relaxing show to simple watch and laugh at. I don't expect it to be ground breaking but I think it's going to be fun.

* **[Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15613/Hakkenden:_Touhou_Hakken_Ibun)** Hakkenden seems to be your average shounen. That being said it's definitely not uninteresting. The MCs' seem to have some sort of spirits living inside of them and the Church seems to be after them because of it. There also seems to be a darker secret involving their past. It's exciting and action packed. I look forward to finding out more about the plot in weeks to come.

* **[Kotoura-san](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15379/Kotoura-san)** I went into Kotoura-san with no prior knowledge of it and let me tell you: the first half of episode 1 is incredibly depressing. It's one of the saddest

* **[Love Live! School Idol Project](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15051/Love_Live!_School_Idol_Project)** Love Live! is an idol show about a group of girls trying to form an idol group in order to increase applications to their highschool which is in danger of closing. So far it's cute and light-hearted. I'm not really sure what else to say about it after just one episode other than that it's piqued my interest.

* **[Mangirl!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14045/Mangirl!)** No, they are not drawing the manga themselves. They are attempting to start a manga magazine like Jump! but their lacking attention spans are hindering progress. It's another cute and funny short (3 min per episode).

* **[Maoyuu Maou Yuusha](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14833/Maoyuu_Maou_Yuusha)** Maoyuu is about medieval economics. To me it feels like a combination of [Spice and Wolf](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2966/Ookami_to_Koushinryou)'s story and [Fractale](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9314/Fractale)'s artwork. The first episode is a bit [fanservice-y](http://i.imgur.com/XhRsC.gif) but the second episode turns it way down and the plot really begins. I'm really enjoying Maoyuu and expect good things from it. Anyone who like Spice and Wolf should check it out.

* **[Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15315/Mondaiji-tachi_ga_Isekai_kara_Kuru_Sou_Desu_yo)** Mondaiji feels a lot like a more serious version of [Dog Days](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10155/Dog_Days). I don't want to spoil anything so I won't say much about the plot but let me say I really REALLY like this show so far. Only one episode in and it's managed to hook me completely. It's a combination of action and comedy and I cannot wait for more.

* **[Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14749/Ore_no_Kanojo_to_Osananajimi_ga_Shuraba_Sugiru)** OreShura is a rom-com about a highschool boy

* **[Senran Kagura](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15119/Senran_Kagura)** I honestly am not enjoying Senran that much. It's a lot like [Sekirei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4063/Sekirei) but without the interesting premise that allowed me to ignore the fan-service. I'm not going to drop it because I try not to drop anything but if it doesn't pick up I'm definitely going to have to force myself to finish it. Hopefully it was just a weak first episode. However if you like busty ninjas and lots of fan-service

* **[Senyuu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15751/Senyuu)** Another short (3 mins per episode)

* **[Tamako Market](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16417/Tamako_Market)** Holy crap is this bird funny. I've watched the first episode three times already it's so good. I would kill for that bird. Tamako is completely ridiculous and a lot of fun. I have really high hopes for it. Also KyoAni is as beautiful as always. Anyone who likes comedy should check it out.

* **[Vividred Operation](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14283/Vividred_Operation)** After the first episode Vividred feels like [Strike Witches](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3667/Strike_Witches) mixed with [Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha](http://myanimelist.net/anime/76/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha). Lots of [close up shots of young girls' asses](http://i.imgur.com/MgZMC.jpg ""Well that's *one* way to watch the sunrise..."") and these girls have to protect the world from some unknown enemy with a power that blurs the line between magic and technology. The enemy (called [Alones](http://i.imgur.com/zKViQ.jpg)) even look very similar to the [Neuroi](http://i.imgur.com/rQ6At.jpg) in Strike Witches

* **[Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16005/Zettai_Karen_Children:_The_Unlimited_-_Hyoubu_Kyousuke)** This show is awesome. It feels a lot like a combination of [CODE:BREAKER](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11703/Code:Breaker)

Well that's all I'm watching

---
**EDIT:**

I figured for the hell of it I'd add shows that continued from the fall season:

* **[Ixion Saga DT](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14765/Ixion_Saga_DT)** Ixion Saga DT is funny. Funny as hell. It's utterly ridiculous. It's a parody and makes a lot of references to many popular shows but also maintains its originality. Imagine your typical old school cynical high school student flung into a strange fantastical world that's eerily similar to the video game he was playing only moments earlier. Shenanigans begin and hilarity ensues. A sillier version of [Zero no Tsukaima](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1195/Zero_no_Tsukaima)

* **[Little Busters!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13655/Little_Busters!)** Little Busters! is extremely similar to [Angel Beats!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6547/Angel_Beats!). I'm not saying the story is similar

* **[Magi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14513/Magi)** Magi is an original take on The Arabian Nights. It's a lot of fun and the pacing is absolutely perfect. It has great characters and a lot of action. It's a wonderful show.

* **[Psycho-Pass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13601/Psycho-Pass)** Oh my god this show... This show is ***NOT*** for the weak of heart. Set in an Orwellian future where a person's mental state can be quantified instantly

* **[Robotics;Notes](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13599/Robotics;Notes)** The latest installment in the Semi;Colon Series

* **[Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13759/Sakurasou_no_Pet_na_Kanojo)** Sakurasou is the best slice of life airing this fall season. The characters are fun, and the back-and-forths are the best I have ever seen. It's a story about the effect talented people have on those around them, be it crushing their spirit or inspiring them to try harder. I love it and look forward to every new episode.

* **[Shinsekai Yori](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori)** From the New World is an amazing story about how a seemingly perfect world almost never is as good as it seems. Set in the far future

* **[Zetsuen no Tempest](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14075/Zetsuen_no_Tempest)** Zetsuen is the most underrated show of the fall season in my opinion. It's an amazingly interesting story about the struggle between two sides who are fighting desperately for what they honestly believe is right. It's full of Shakespeare quotes and the main characters are even based on Hamlet and Romeo fro their respective play. The action is intense but it's the dialogue that will keep you on the edge of your seat,False,self,t5_2ssl0,1358102664.0,suggest,MAL,t3_16h8pb

Especially adults who have gone trough really difficult puberty. This put it to the difficult spot.

The series features two things prominently:

- well-animated transforming space fighter jets battling alien swarms

- catchy J-pop songs written for the series by Yoko Kanno (Cowboy Bebop

The songs are well integrated into the series, a private military company that is often called to defend the colony, and Ranka the aspiring idol. Sheryl Nome, and popular idol from a nearby colony, also visits for a brief stopover on her tour and is an inspiration to Ranka.

The voice cast includes:

- Yuuichi Nakamura (Tomoya from Clannad

The show starts a fair bit peculiarly, quickly establishes the rules of how the supernatural elements work and allows the watcher to understand the personality of the characters involved a little.

I won't lie to you - this series isn't for everyone. It's very slow-paced and there isn't much drama or action to infuse the plot with adrenaline. Neo-Venezia, heartwarming, and beautiful. You can sit back, turn off your brain for a while, and appreciate the little things in life.

What really makes the series is its cast of characters. For the most part, Aika and Alice, or her mentor, Alicia. Each of them have their own distinct personality and play off each other very well, not to mention the fact that, by the end of the third season, each of the three apprentice Undines we follow have developed and grown as characters in some way or another.

Even the soundtrack is fantastic and one of the best I've heard - for example

Unfortunately, but that's about it.

1373480561.0,1i0uoo,I just want to Recommend Rec. One of my favourite romances.,rinen,19,2,15,"[Rec](http://myanimelist.net/anime/710/Rec) is a fairly short 10 episode series (including the ova) that last 15 minutes each episode.

The story is about the relationship between a man who is trying to do his job and had always previously failed and pushed around in his company

The girl later ends up being part of his promotional campaign and they get along really well but the relationship between them becomes strained.  

Its a far more realistic portrayal of characters than your average anime.  

If you enjoy comedy romances but preferred if there was more of a conclusion or the relationship wasn't stupid or explainable then this show would be for you. 

Somehow this show pulls of more emotional depth than most anime pull off in 24 episodes.

**[Higurashi no Naku Koro ni](http://myanimelist.net/anime/934/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni)** and **[Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1889/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni_Kai)**

Higurashi is a horror mystery thriller that makes you the detective. Can you piece together the seemingly random and chaotic events to figure out just *what* is going on before Kai spells it all out for you? I sure as hell couldn't.

Higurashi's first season is something a lot of people don't make it through. Whether it's the occasional graphic scenes or the apparent lack of a plot, and character development. As I said above, Higurashi makes *you* the detective. When I say this I mean that it throws bits and pieces of information at you and leaves it up to you to put them together into the greater story. A piece of information you get may not be relevant to the information given directly before and after it, but chances are it fits in somewhere. As for the character development, it's top notch. You see these characters through so many different situations, and get to know them so well, that by the time Kai comes around you're pretty much able to accurately predict their actions. They really grow on you and you can't help but root for them.

Then comes Kai. Kai is all about the plot, but it is incredible. You'll find yourself on the edge of your seat and it'll be hard not to watch it all in one sitting.

Another great thing about Higurashi is its rewatch value. While you already know all the twists, everything ties together.

***

While I thoroughly enjoyed Higurashi while going in blind and usually recommend others do the same

1. [Mildish spoiler. Not central to the plot but will help figure out a twist prior to the reveal:](/s ""Pay attention to the eyes. When do they change? Whose eyes change at different points?"")

2. [Bigger spoiler. Will almost guarantee you will figure out the twist mentioned above before the reveal:](/s ""Who is it that is actually insane? Who is sick and who's trying to help?"") [Big tip for figuring this out. Be warned it's a decent sized spoiler:](/s ""Pay close attention to the actual content of the dialogue over the tone in which it is said."")

It's just a reminder that we can 'see the world' with more than just our eyes, and a little girl's imagination can truly be a powerful thing.

Kaiba is a truly unique work of art.  It's experimental through and through and tackles an area of anime that we don't see very often.  Very ponderous and thoughtful in nature

The first thing about Kaiba that stands out is the [odd art style](http://thenullset.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/editkaiba31054.jpg?w=600). The art is devoid of any real textures or depth and feels very retro.  It captures a style very reminiscent to that of Osamu Tezuka.  While it seems childish and lazy at first

The show is very much hard sci-fi and thus should not be picked up by those who do not have the patience to stick through the bizarre art or are more into lighthearted and simple shows. However,False,self,t5_2ssl0,1376184969.0,suggest,,t3_1k4d0d

Meeramera's story is pretty typical. The head of Hell, Prince Enma, along with his two friends, Princess Yukiko and Kapaeru, to unleash judgment on mischievous demons living in the human world. The story isn't really what makes Meeramera great, though it does have its moments; it's the series’ sense of humor that makes it worthwhile.
 
The series' humor is outlandish and adheres to the tone of Uncle Go's original work. To give an example of just how outlandish Meeramera's humor is, but Enma destroys him anyway and reverts everyone back to their old selves.

1346209637.0,z00ig,"[Request] Anime with well-written adult characters, believable character interactions, and a cohesive, engaging plot.",justgivingsomeadvice,0,
My request is pretty straightforward
FMA:B 9.2/10
Steins;Gate (9.1/10)
A:TLA (9.1/10) It's not anime
Cowboy Bebop (8.8/10)
Samurai Champloo (7.7/10)
Baccano! (6.8/10)

What I'm looking for is an adult-aimed anime. No cutesy high school slice-of-life with no greater point. I don't mind slice-of-life if there's a greater plot going on (think S;G first 11 episodes).

I want something heavy on character development, I'm ok. Furthermore, I like stuff heavy in themes. This is prevalent in FMA:B and A:TLA moreso than the other ones. It's not a requirement, but thinking critically about what I've just watched is nice.
Another thing is

The second big thing I'm looking for a cohesive plot. The plot shouldn't get in the way of the characters (this is why I didn't enjoy Baccano as much as the others; didn't care for anyone besides Isaac/Miria), and Chekhov's guns. It can be complicated like FMA:B, or simple like Champloo, or somewhere in the middle. But I want it to be 'smart.' This is one big reason why I adore S;G. The plot is very, very clean, but it never gets in the way of the characters.  In fact, the plot is generally a medium through which character interaction occurs. 

So yeah, etc., where you train to get stronger. I personally am not a big fan of that.

So yeah

Edit: I thought I would add a little background about myself. I literally started watching anime late July. I'm just 18, but I acknowledge there are some good/great shows (and the fact that it's anime really stretches the limits for what's possible) that are anime. That's why I'm looking for 'adult' shows, because I imagine Moe/cutesy stuff to appeal to people who like anime for the sake of it being anime.

Kotoura-San is an anime about a girl named Kotoura, that's all I'm telling you, since the show itself takes pride in making the viewers think it's a typical slice of life show.  The male lead isn't stupid, he's witty and makes the first move.  The female lead, Kotoura, isn't a hidden otaku or just average or nosebleeds at the sight of a shirtless boy; She is somebody who has the ability to read minds and has, at some points

**But wait, minus the last episode, is poor and predictable.  The beginning, however, is full of betrayal, twists and turns, and boasts a male lead so in touch with reality that he makes Araragi look like a boy who couldn't get in the robot.  The last episode is really only there if you want to tie up the loose ends the first four episodes created

I really do think everybody should watch the first four episodes of this series (and optionally episode 12) if they are even remotely interested in a tragic romance

The opening and the fact that this show was aired at “Kids Station” is the biggest deceive in anime history. The first episode suggests an easy to watch kid’s anime with some supernatural creatures like Pokemon. BUT this series is totally not for children. After 2-3 episodes the main focus changes from happy slice of life to despair, suicide and despair.  




  Plot:   
The main character, which she names Hoshimaru, can fly and change its appearance. After returning home she realizes that there are many other kids who met creatures like Hoshimaru. 




Who should watch this?  
If you like shows such as Bokurano


Don’t watch this show if you don’t like depressing anime with horrible things and various brutal deaths happening especially to minors.

In between episodes of Shingeki no Kyojin I watched Haibane Renmei which I loved, funny, heart breaking, and the ending literally made me cry manly tears.

Today I started watching Stiens;Gate now and I'm downloading Psycho Pass and Death Note and Full Metal Alchemist.

I think that's enough to keep me busy for a little while :) So far all of your suggestions have been amazing. But I think I need a little comedy in my life. Is there an Anime equivalent to Spongebob Squarepants? I admit I am a fan of SpongeBob, annoying style of it and was wondering if there exists something like it in the Anime world. Maybe something I can watch with my kids.

When I first looked at Cross Game I thought: baseball, but in a way that it didn't feel like baseball itself was a focus. Baseball was a Vehicle that allowed the characters to grow. It could've been another sport, or a club, or something else entirely and I think you could have essentially the same story.


Cross game is character centric. You're not going to have giant conspiracies, etc.... The plot isn't full of twists and unseen turns. You watch Cross Game for the Characters. They might not be extremely complex, but I didn't ever feel as if the characters weren't compelling enough to continue to the story. I would say the character development was slow (as there are 50 episodes) but it never really *felt* that way watching it. I always wanted to go right into the next episode. 


I'd recommend this to you if you're a fan of animes like Toradora, is it doesn't feel awkward, as so often highschool animes do. There isn't a whole lot of romance in cross game, and when it's there its subtle. But it is there (more so towards the end) and it has a very nice sweet ending.


Oh, and hopefully it'll be a Home Run!

I watched an anime back when I was in High School, or what I remember of it and hopefully we can come up with the title!

First off: This one is a Romance, I am sorry if my details are messed up here, its been a great long time since I have watched it. If anyone could help letting me know the name of this it would be wonderful! I am not really sure if it was subbed or dubbed, I do know it was a short series maybe 13, 24, 26 episodes long. 

I had another that I could not quite remember the name of but it eludes me on how the story even went, I remember a scene from it: They were all sitting in a restaurant eating soup maybe? Sorry, Like I said I could just be making the first anime into two different ones, but I am pretty sure that I am not, its just been years and I just cant remember at all. 

Would there be a way to search for something like this ? I think both were romance. Thank you for all the help that people provide. I also can answer questions if need be

**Edit: First one is Kimi ga Nozomu Eien - Thank you Silverhydra and Randomize17**

**Edit 2: UPDATE** I have been trying to think about the second Anime and have pretty much given up on trying to remember it. I think I am coming back with some information or maybe I am just blending things all together with the first one. Here is some more info: 

Setting was in College or in High School, that was the scene in the shop of them eating soup/dinner together. I think they end up getting together/ maybe they don't. I they guy having a very important phone conversation outside in the rain/sunshine on a cellphone or phone booth. They highlighted this conversation because it was very important information on one of the parties sides. It was a serious art style and all like present day, nothing futuristic and abnormal at all. 

I am trying to provide as much information as possible. Also anything from 2010-2013 will not be it. Also the series was shorter 13-24 and its completed. 

**Edit 3:** Some of its coming back to me. Guy likes the girl but never could get the courage to ask her out maybe ? Then they were dating other people and went out for dinner together or lunch together. The second Anime was a  drama relationship anime,False,self,t5_2ssl0,1371817609.0,,,t3_1gq34d

**What is this thread about?**

Hello there!  Everybody has their favorite genre of anime.  Some prefer action, Mirai Nikki, and even Baccano in some cases.

For a long while now on /r/animesuggest, you can always say Higurashi or Mirai Nikki, but part of the experience of watching psychological anime is that you give yourself space in between each episode to build suspense.  Those who actually watched Steins;Gate while it was airing know this kind of excitement.  Rarely do I get the chance to suggest a good psychological anime while it is airing, but Sasami-san@Ganbaranai has given me that opportunity, and I'm here to suggest it to you.

**What is Sasami-san@Ganbaranai?**

Sasami-San is a psychological anime produced by SHAFT, they also produced Madoka Magica and the Bakemonogatari series.  It follows the life of Sasami-San (get it?  Her name is half the title!) and her brother as they fight to not only protect themselves but others in a battle against their own powers.  It has fan-service in the first few episodes, but it's almost entirely dropped about five or six episodes into the series.

Did that sound vague?  It should be, people sadly get the wrong idea from the anime, dismissing it as being just filler space until better anime airs since they give it up before it gets good, but you have the chance to break that chain of ignorance!

For those of you who weren't around at the time, people dismissed it before it had the chance to reach its climax.  Higurashi and Mirai Nikki didn't suffer from this as much since they showed their action ASAP and made the confusion happen in the middle/late end of the series.

**Isn't Sasami-san@Ganbaranai still airing?**

Yes it is, the better it tastes.

**TL;DR:**  Combine some of the fanservice/supernatural of Nisemonogatari with the story-telling of Steins;Gate and you come up with a beautiful creature known as Sasami-San.  Great music,[Suggestion],False,self,t5_2ssl0,False,suggest,True

He's a 23 year old guy I've known for a few years. I can't remember exactly what the conversation was, he's got this idea that all anime follow the dbz formula, where the heroes train and find some tough guy and get beaten up (but get better) and proceed to train til they kick the bad guy's butt and then it repeats.

I asked him what show's he's watched, he's stuck to fairly filler-heavy shounen quite a bit, which makes it understandable for him to assume all anime drags on quite a bit and has an always-rising power-curve. 

I want to show him a series or two that would help him understand that lumping all anime together is like lumping all western animation together. He's expressed interest in shows like Adventure Time and Avatar

One other problem is simply that I'm not *hugely* into anime myself. I mean

So that being said, or if there's been any really good newer shows I've somehow missed. 

He'd probably not want to watch shows about high school kids  or long-runner shounens like One Piece or Fairy Tail (which I consider quite good

A couple other ones I had also considered showing him were TTGL (I decided maybe to hold off til he's watched one or two other anime

Kaiji is a no good low life, and he can't really pay back the debt except over many years of menial labor, which he hates. So he accepts an ambiguous offer and so starts the show.

It centers around gambles and quick thinking in times of need, train of thought which leads him to an epiphany in a time of need. You will like it even more if you are into anime which is about battles of the mind and psychology, a bit like the ones in Legend of the Galactic Heroes's battles.

The best way to describe Kaiji as an experience is that it is immensely tense, it gets really dark at times, and it cannot be clearly expressed. If you have a need to view the immense spectrum of feelings and the message the medium of anime has to offer then watch this anime.

I'm looking to try and get back into anime now and hope there's a few hidden gems thats released within the last few years I might have not known; preferably short anime that are under 24 eps.
to give some info on my taste; my favourite anime that i can recall are Cowboy Bebop, Planetes. and recently, Time of Eve.


So I'm preferring anime thats similar
Or dystopian setting but still serious like Cowboy Bebope or last exile.

Stuff I **like**:

* Seinen, TV Tropes link =P), Slice of Life

* Anime that make you think

* Character studies

* No clear-cut good and evil

* For reference

TV - Mushishi

Movies - Mononoke Hime

Others I liked include Steins;Gate, Aku no Hana


Stuff I **dislike**:

* Fanservice

* The cliché Shounen art style with all that funky-colored spiky hairdo and whatnot (like Dangan Ronpa; quite a shame since the story has tons of potential). I'll take Aku no Hana art over that any day of the week.

* Non-permanent death. Unless there are very good in-universe reasons (as in Steins;Gate)

(For clarification on that...My sister was really the person who wanted to see that, as long as they realize I'm spending time with friends and not with them...and if I asked them not to go, they wouldn't have, or would have went to another showing)

Surprisingly (or at least she tells me) she enjoyed it, and watched the show in its entirety twice that night, and has since bought shit tons of Madoka merch.

My mom has some experience with other magical girl shows due to my little sister

I tell you this to sort of give you an idea of what experience she has with anime.  She now wants to watch something else

My mother has never been a fan of fantasy of any kind...so I have trouble understanding why she enjoyed the madoka movies. She is very into crime dramas

My father is very much into things like Harry Potter, and various other fantasy settings.  He however is very xenophobic, so I really want to pick something without too many anime cliches.  Because of this, I am more aiming for something he would be into...since if my mother learned to enjoy the madoka movies, she will probably learn to enjoy almost anything I picked out.

Both of them are very christian, or a series that has cliffhanger after cliffhanger so they don't feel like they are really watching a massive series.

I also would prefer the series/movie be dubbed.

The things I have considered


**TV Series**

* **Attack on Titan** - I think if my dad can get used to subtitles

* **Cowboy Bebop**  - I know for a fact my dad will enjoy this

* **Steins;Gate** - If I can get through the first 8 episodes as fast as possible

* **Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex** - slightly episodic, I am worried that will really throw them off.

* **Fate/Zero** - I know they will both find something to enjoy about this show


**Movies**

* **The Wolf children Ame and Yuki** - I think they will both really like this after they adjust to the subtitles...but the beastiality undertones are going to make things really awkward for them.

* **Summer Wars** - At the moment, but it's also very unbelievable...

* **The girl who leapt through time** - I'm not sure about this.  It has quite a few cliches

* **Spirited Away** - Everyone always seems to suggest this one...I have a feeling they will probably LIKE it


So tell me /r/animesuggest what do you think? Have you been put into a similar situation?

I would prefer single season shows, it may just take longer, but at least she'd watch it. Keeping that in mind, again don't hesitate if the show doesn't have a (good) dub.

In your suggestions, but if you don't/can't no problem, just trying to save myself some time. Links are also helpful, but again, nothing I can't do on my own once I get the name.

My ideas so far (feel free to discount ones that I put here)

*Steins;Gate* (yes i know right outa the bat

***Serial Experiments: Lain*** (although

***Baccano*** (this is my favorite as of now. its got a little bit of everything, comedy, tragedy, action. it doesn't hold back on the blood or gore, but its never excessive. the story doesn't hand much if anything out to the watching and it zooms by at a breakneck pace)

**Madoka Magica** (proof that even if you have a cute characters and it starts off all innocent and such that it won't stay/be that way forever.)

Fate/Zero (i guess similar to Baccano, [b] its 2 seasons, and [c] its sub not dub. 2 season+dub doesn't make a great combination.)

ShinSekai Yori (kinda like Madoka

*Welcome to the NHK* (its dark

*Neon Genesis Evangelion* (well *I* thought the dub was good....however Shinji being Shinji may make her want to stop watching)

That's all I got. Thank you

**TL;DR**: Recommend me something a bit mature that would prove to my mother that anime is not just children's cartoons. Preferably something that is one season and has a above average English dub.

So! I'm looking for anime (or even manga) that:  

* A) focuses on **strong, between friends/family/teammates/epic rivals/whatever), **even/especially to the exclusion of romance**; and  
* B) is **character-consistent**: it doesn't matter if the series has an overarching multi-episode plot or is broken up into self-encapsulated episodes as long as the characters develop over time; I get frustrated and lose interest when characters backslide meaninglessly or actions taken in one episode have no consequence in the next one. Actions should matter

Big ol' bonus points for:

* I) strong
* II) a really compelling art style with sick
* III) HILARITY; and  
* IV) more light-hearted than super heavy drama

The Studio Ghibli movies are my holy grail of character creation/growth

I'm willing to try any genre except horror; while I tend to favor the intimacy of slice-of-life, maybe it actually sucked? it's been a while)!! Basically, romance is OK but I like it much better when love takes the form of tearful bro-hugs instead of tearful make-outs.

Anyway!

**Anime/manga I've loved because of the aforementioned elements:**  

* Hikaru no Go  
* Ookiku Furikabutte/Big Windup!
* One Piece 
* Sakamichi no Apollon/Kids on the Slope  
* anything by Studio Ghibli
* Tekkon Kinkreet 
* Yotsuba&amp;!

**Anime/manga I found OK:**  

* Baccano!  
* FMA  
* Paprika  

**Anime I gave up on a couple of episodes in:**

* Ao no Exorcist  
* Arakawa Under the Bridge   
* Giant Killing  
* Ouran High School Host Club   
* Summer Wars  

**Anime I've had recommended to me/plan on watching?:**  

* 5 Centimeters Per Second  
* Azumanga Daioh  
* Bakemonogatari
* Cowboy Bebop   
* Durarara!!  
* Eyeshield 21  
* Fate Zero  
* FLCL   
* The Girl Who Leapt Through Time  
* Gurren Lagann  
* House of Five Leaves  
* Mushishi
* Natsume Yuujincho  
* Piano Forest  
* Princess Tutu  
* Puella Magi Madoka Magica  
* Revolutionary Girl Utena  
* Samurai Champloo    
* anything by Satoshi Kon  
* Space Brothers  
* Tiger and Bunny  
* The Tatami Galaxy/Yojōhan Shinwa Taikei    
* Tsuritama  
* Un-Go  
* Usagi Drop  

**If it's helpful

* Avatar: The Last Airbender (amazing well-developed characters who undergo significant growth; also features an incredible plot and superb worldbuilding and fucking sick animation; *my perfect show*)  
* Adventure Time 
* Gravity Falls

-High School of the Dead: First recommended to me by a friend. While seeing zombie fighting was entertaining at first

-Death Note: This was my first full series and I found it phenomenal. The art style

-Speed Grapher: The premise, and the series always had a sense of humour. I also liked the dynamic between the principle cast. Once again, I loved the music as well.

-Cowboy Bebop: A classic

With that said there are certain criteria I'm looking for in the next series: 

-Mature art style (think Death Note, but the cutesy design doesn't work for me :/ 
-No mecha. I've heard that Code Geass would be perfect for me
-No high school. I know that's a tall order by anime standards. I'm fine if high school plays a minor role in things
-Plot. Basically, something emotional. -I would also really like it (though not required) if there were a romance side-plot. I like love stories :) 
-Also
-No 600 episode series please! 75 episodes is probably my limit
Now I know I've painted myself into a corner with those criteria
-Completed series! Attack on Titan looks amazing

1375589017.0,1jnwu0,[request] Looking for a new anime to watch,Nagisan,8,2,9,"I tend to enjoy anime where people have unique powers along with a good storyline, but do not mind reading subs if it's the only option.

Following this is a list of anime I have watched

* **Code Geass** - Love everything about this anime (the entire series), the action is great. I love the different Geass powers and the battles involving them, possibly most importantly I love how Lelouch uses his genius throughout to battle his enemies.

* **Death Note** - Love this one too, most importantly, how Light uses his genius to battle N and his other enemies.

* **Full Metal Alchemist / Brotherhood** - I liked FMA on its own, and again like the previous two this one was for the action, and the similar but unique powers that each alchemist had. Though I feel the storyline in this was better than Bleach and Naruto.

* **Bleach** - This one was more about the action than story. Don't get me wrong

* **Nartuo** - Similar to Bleach

* **Yu Yu Hakusho** - Recommended by a friend I enjoyed this quite a bit. The battles were great

* **Darker Than Black** - Very good story, it wasn't just use your powers at-will with no drawbacks.

* **Steins;Gate** - Excellent story and an interesting take on time travel. The characters were great and while it wasn't action packed like some of the other anime I've enjoyed but the story and concept was interesting enough to me to keep me highly interested.

* **Sword Art Online** - Good story

* **Mobile Suit Gundam 00** - A bit outside my normal zone (more mech focused than I generally prefer), followed by the good guys getting a powerup in the following episode. I guess that's how it goes but it didn't seem like it took any effort, the powerups were just there but inactive until needed. It was enjoyable, but mech combat is not my favorite.

* **Future Diary** - Watched this on a whim

1374650206.0,1ixyj8,"[Suggestion] Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere (Kyoukai Senjou no Horizon) - romance, comedy, action, adventure, fantasy",9,"So, background

The MAL links are as follows: [Season 1](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10456/Kyoukaisenjou_no_Horizon) [Season 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12487/Kyoukaisenjou_no_Horizon_II)  

Based off the description, Thomas Shakespeare = William Shakespeare, and so on. Also, the faction names. Tres Espana. Svet Rus. Far East. England. Hexagone Francaise. And so on.  

Aoi Toori is the main protagonist of both seasons, happy, perverted, cheerful guy who does absolutely batshit insane things. He gropes and undresses woman without hesitation. He is literally naked the entire second season. Yet, he is very respected by his comrades. His girl, Horizon, lost her emotions and they are used to create Mortal Sin Armaments

What are the good things about this series? Cast. Absolutely huge cast. You have Musashi's crew, P.A. Oda, and more. Not just numbers, but variety. Each user has their own rather unique ability (seriously), which is very refreshing to see.  

BGM. The soundtrack, especially Tenzou's ""magnificent scene"" as I like to call it without spoiling much. The track itself is called ""Hiding Determination"".  

Animation and background. Absolutely fantastic. The fight scenes are very well done, and action is very well done.  

Now, weird, out of place, slow paced. And honestly, it probably is unless you read the LN's. But believe me, when you get past those first few episodes, you'll be in for a blast. If by episode, let's say 10 of the first season and you still don't like it

So to those who have already watched this series, therefore a third season (heck, probably a fourth as well since there IS that much material left. The LN's are still ongoing.) is very likely. In addition, sales are reportedly doing pretty well."")

Overall, you might get really attached to it. It's rather unique cast, story, and amazing soundtrack, fight scenes, and animation really shows what this series is all about.",[Suggestion],self,,

A lot of people die, and the show fills up with more feelings. I kinda entered in denial when it was hinted that Nia wouldn't survive if the anti-spirals were defeated, but I just assumed the ""power of love"" would make everything okay. I was glad up until the last few minutes when they get married and she just goes away. Again, the ending makes sense, Nia disappears, but that doesn't make it any less sad :( "")

[Code Geass](/s ""Watching Leleouch misfiring his Geass on Euphemia, and then losing her too was hearth-breaking. To make it all worse, he never drops his act in front of other characters. I almost lost it on how he reacts to Shirley being killed. It all makes sense at the end, when his plan is revealed, but that doesn't make the anime any less fucked up, specially when only a few understood why he did what he did. I don't like remembering Code Geass that much, it messes me up so I will just stop here."")

[Death Note](/s ""The way that Light used and abused people was very sickening, but that didn't stop me from wishing for his victory. The way that the anime wraps up is pretty cool. I'm was really okay with Light getting totally outplayed by Near, and it was very satisfying seeing Light and Mikami losing their shit. Seeing Light running with his body full of bullets and Ryuk laughing and writing his name down was pretty cool and fitting, and then, after Light dies, it cuts to Misa. God fucking dammit, why :( Seeing her just broke me. The sad song, so watching that that ending really messed me up. Great

As for ""happy endings"", great final battle, many tears ) but actually ends very well. I've not watched anything past the Shishio fight, since they are all fillers and I was advised to not watch the ""anime final OVA"" since according to people is complete garbage.

* Smart: Smart animes make good use of every episode. I'm okay for an anime having a few fun

* Soul Crushing: Happy endings or sad endings, at some points in the series I just had to pause mid episode and take a walk because of the roller-coaster of emotions, specially towards the ending.

* Satisfactory ending: This is the most important thing. The anime has to have a satisfactory ending. Closure is the most important thing after watching it all. I hate how some animes make shit up to add ""depth"" to the story, when most of them never played a big role at the end.

I'm also not interested in ""incomplete"" animes. That means if the anime is currently airing the 1st season or the 2nd season, but S1 alone is very good. I want to know more about the anime, but if Season 2 doesn't happen for some reason, I'll be satisfied.

FMA: Tried hard to watch that, even though it seems to have a spot in about every top 3...

Blackrockshooter: If there's more anime with such good story and artstyle

DBZ: Only on the list because I watched it ages ago.

Bleach/OnePiece, especially the last arc was great, one piece's long-term plot for some reason intrigues me a ton, and I love how everything is connected in the end), with lots of action, and a fair bit of random fun in general. Bleach maybe became a bit dark near the end, but I actually quite liked it.

Naruto: Mainly only watching because it seems like the series will end soon

Hunter x Hunter: Enjoying this anime a ton

Fairy Tail: Way too childish for me to pick this up again
