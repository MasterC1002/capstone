1361143237.0,18pt71,ZaZa insiders question - what's up with room 322?,joelikesmusic,3409,831,2198,"stay here frequently when on business.  Hotel was booked solid and my colleague managed to score a room unplanned.  We all had normal zaza style rooms (swank) and he ended up in this goth dungeon closet.

Seriously- the room had a chain holding the bed to wall, bed and window.    

We asked about it at the front desk and the clerk looked it up and said "" that room isn't supposed to be rented.' and immediately moved him.

Anyone know whats up with this room?

Edit to add the follow up from the Houston Press.  [Link](http://blogs.houstonpress.com/hairballs/2013/02/hotel_za_za_secret_room_creepy.php).

Now I have to go and see if I can make reservations in the yacht room.  

Edit 2:  Chronicle emailed and I put them in touch with my friend who stayed in this room.  [Link](http://www.chron.com/life/article/Story-behind-ZaZa-s-Hard-Times-room-AKA-the-4288247.php).
 His name isn't max but that isn't the point of the story.  I still don't understand why these rooms aren't on the website (when all the other themed rooms are and this is a hotel - meaning they want to rent rooms).

Edit 3: This thread has been fun.  I'm not much for conspiracy theories and don't really buy all the skull and bones stuff. 
I just wanted to know what was up with the room and figured someone on here might know a bit.  
lots of the posts are asking questions about the pictures - they were taken months ago and no staging was involved. I'm not the photographer

And to the very new redditor offering me a bounty to delete this thread  - I'll totally do it because cash is cash.  But i don't want to die either.  So let's do this publicly - I'm posting your message you sent me.  And we can meet at the Monarch bar next week  - I'll be in town on Monday &amp; will update this thread when I get to Monarch so we can meet.

1342711787.0,wtjzj,I moved to Houston 3 Days Ago. Here Are Some Things I've Learned.,dead2writes,508,77,652,"Hey /r/Houston

I just made the move to the city from Pennsylvania. This is my first time living in a major city. I made the move because 1) My girlfriend got a job as a high school English teacher

So here are some things this small-town young gentleman has noticed about his new home after a few days of residency.

1) Whataburger. Is. Amazing.

2) Mexican food. Is. Amazing. 

3) 610 is nuts. Just liquid insanity nuts. But besides that

4) My ""meh"" quality apartment has central air

5) Your DPS is new to me. Everything was handled by the DMV in PA. Just thinking about trying to get my TX  license makes my head hurt. 

6) ZOMG NO STATE INCOME TAX!

7) All political candidates are Republican or The Other Republican.

8) Galleria is totally overpriced.

9) It rains here like once a day for 30 minutes. Which might explain why it feels like we're living in a swamp.

10) Galveston beach water is so warm and heavenly. 

11) I was expecting everyone to have a southern accent like my family in Virginia. This is not so. Most people speak just like me

12) I love saying ""Y'all."" Absolutely love it.

13) Man the Astros are terrible.

14) The Texans are going to dominate the AFC South this year. I'm a Redskins fan by birth (VA-born) but will support the Texans happily.

15) Lone Star is just like Keystone Light

16) WTF Sideways Traffic Lights.

17) Ozarka Water &gt; Tap Water. 

18) Everyone has a pair of cowboy boots. I seriously did not know they were this popular. I kind of want a pair of cowboy boots. 

19) There are hot peppers on everything and I love it. 

20) BBQ = OMFG. 

So /r/Houston, where to go or where to hang out I'd love to hear it! I'm getting a motorcycle next month, and hope to find a casual riding club somewhere in SW Houston. I also played regular bar shows in a band back in PA, so I'm hoping to find some musically inclined people here as well. 

**EDIT:** GF just informed me that we are NOT in River Oaks but in the Galleria area. Flair changed appropriately.

1363963827.0,1asufm,Best Idea for the Astrodome I've Heard,smellyhoustonian,459,61,122,"****Edit**** The architecture student who did the project is going to sign up fr reddit and hopefully try and answer some questions. Username: UHArch

I saw a masters project from a UH Architecture student that essentially deconstructed the dome down to its metal frame and having it be essentially Houston's Eiffel Tower.

Underneath the steel skeleton of the Astrodome, it can be exhibition space, or outdoor grazing land for the Livestock show part of the HLSR. 3) During the year, it's just a ton of greenspace that can be chalked off for a sports complex (Imagine having your kickball beer league underneath the old astrodome)

The cost of deconstruction is much less than the current demolition costs being proposed (You can't blow it up because it's so close to Reliant Stadium)

I don't know how to make this idea get any traction where it matters

Edit: Another user asked me to put up this info for how to hopefully get this idea some traction. He had City Council and the Mayor listed, so the County officials are listed at the bottom. Hit them all up, because council members can lobby the county, and so can the Mayor.

For this sale, I will Reddit at the front desk for a few hours instead of at home, it’s really no big deal. I love having new people find the store). 

We are a very old school bookstore that is doing well in this tough climate for independent bookstores because we do a lot of business on the internet. We have no gimmicks and rarely do events. It’s just a deceptively large, front-to-back packed-with-books bookstore. If you like books you should probably budget a few hours just for browsing. 

If it’s a pretty day we have nice patios in front, so feel free to bring some food or grab a cup of coffee and set up to eat something or have a drink in the sunshine. The last two were a big success and both my parents and everyone who I talked to who made it to the sale were really excited. I hope to see some of y’all there!

Edit:  More info from Pat Greer:  Vicky was complaining on Saturday of a head injury.  Vicky was scheduled to help in the kitchen but had to lie down.  One of my current best case scenarios has Vicky suffering from a concussion and simply walking off into an unknown city.  If anyone in Houston is willing to put up flyers

The Pharmacy manager will refuse to sell you either the Plan B or a Pregnancy Test

So my GF and I like to keep a PB pill at home just in case something happens, it's no big deal. 

Today was different, I bought them here before without issue. She then tells me she wont sell it to men. I ask her if this is a policy of CVS or if it's a personal belief and she straight face tells me it's her personal belief. I then ask to speak to her supervisor or manager and she informs me she is the manager, a quick glance at her name tag corroborates this. I then ask for the general store manager but seems she has authority when it comes to medications. I then ask her if there is another employee (I did not see any) or store I can go to buy them and she said ""only the woman can"". 

After a quick Goggling it does appear that [men over 18 can buy them](http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/what-fda-says.html)

EDIT: Just got a call back from the CVS Corp offices. I explained to them the same stuff as noted above and she put me on hold while she called the store/pharmacist. The corp rep told me this was in no way a policy of CVS and said the pharmacist said she was actually out of stock of the PB pill, it’s because you called Corp, but if you want we can order the pill for you and have it by Saturday [PB Pill needs to be taken within 72 hours of conception]. I replied that I will never shop at a CVS again so long as that woman is employed there, and that I already contacted my local news stations with the story. She continued with some platitudes and I collected her contact information and we needed the conversation cordially. 

EDIT #2, however from my reading there does appear to be a refusal clause for pharmacists, that they can refuse to provide medication, but they HAVE to get another employee or store to help you. 

EDIT #3: So looks like it's getting a bit of traction with the local news agencies.

Then you veered toward me and started angrily waving me back.  I was confounded!  I was not in the lane you were cycling in, you were intending to take to the sidewalk and I was blocking your access to it.  When I did not put my vehicle in reverse, you came right up to it and hit it yelling some obscenity and taking off through the park.

**Firstly

You dick.  I am a huge proponent of sharing the road.  Not only do I ride my bicycle for fun, I roller skate on the street, in short: I am rather committed to the idea that we do not need to drive everywhere. I am very bicycle aware when I am driving and am extra cautious around those on the road from motorcycles to pedal-powered.  I am an excellent driver who has had maybe 5 tickets in his life time. You, sir, are a chip-on-the-shoulder jerk face with a little man complex.  Were we standing in line and you behaved that way, you would likely not even have the stones to look me in the eye let alone express yourself like a man.

**Secondly

You douche!  When you break the rules, broke the rules. [Section 45-302](http://library.municode.com/HTML/10123/level4/COOR_CH45TR_ARTXIIBI_DIV1GE.html#COOR_CH45TR_ARTXIIBI_DIV1GE_S45-302RISI): “No person shall ride a bicycle upon a sidewalk in the City of Houston within a business district or where prohibited by sign.” 

Cyclists who break the rules make it dangerous for everybody even for cars who might swerve to avoid hitting you.  But especially pedestrians suffer.  I have been hit on crosswalks and sidewalks by couriers on bike.  It is a two way street to share the road and you must do your part.

**Thirdly

Nice shirt, I can understand your frustration about having to live in a world with motor vehicles, but sharing goes both ways.  You could have very easily continued forward and entered the park from Walker.  You were taking a short cut through the park to get to the court building, I think.  And your short cut puts people in danger. I was busy making eye-contact with you so you would know that I saw you and froze so you could make your way.  Instead, you chose to approach my vehicle (into the cross walk) and accost me. 

You do not get to hit my property because you have to share the road or because I was in the way of your short cut.  You have your head so far up your own ass, I will likely tell you this as I am not a coward.

**TL;DR Bike guy is a coward and an asshole unwilling to share the road.**

There's NO need to spend $25 to park in a lot for Astros/Rockets games etc. You can park on the street for FREE and it will probably be easier and more convenient. 

I never have a problem finding a spot a few blocks away. Plus its good to walk. And I hate trying to get out of parking garages. Most of the time if you park on a good street you can walk right to your car and get out of downtown with minimal hassle. 

I have been doing this for years and have ZERO problems. Street parking is just as safe or secure as a lot. In fact

Don't get suckered in by the guys waving orange flags! You can park on the street free and easy. One time I went to MMP with another couple. They pulled into a $15 lot and I parked on the street literally 10 feet from them. I'll save that money thanks.

The store is Becker's Books about five minutes west of the Loop off the Katy Freeway. Exit Antoine. Go North on Antoine. Turn Left (headed West) on Westview. It will be on the left with a big sign that says BOOKS and you can get to it by U-turning at the second median break. 

We’re open Monday through Saturday 11-6. We’re about as Mom and Pop as you get

Despite the fact that we have about two employees outside the family we have a pretty big online presence due to my parents both having written books about the Houston area and my Mom being an aggressive promoter of the store. You can check us out

FYI and your thoughts on the matter...",reasonable_,128,28,195,"I wanted to gather some feedback and inform fellow Houstonians of what occured this past weekend at a midtown bar (Drinkery).

So my friends and I go to this bar in midtown we've visited multiple times. It wasn't a crazy night but more of a casual one (my roommate had a 5k in the morning and had to be back early). So we go up to the door, Kenneth Cole, and Express for reference).

Odd, who seemed surprisingly against me going in at the door in the first place, walks by and says ""it's cause you not white"" and walks away.

I was pretty dumbfounded and speechless that this would happen in this day and age (I'm Asian btw). So we go to another bar.

30 minutes later, as we had expected. The guy that made the initial comment wasn't present at the door. And then he happens to see us inside as we walk in and proceeds to kick me and my roommate (who is also not white).

I posted this story on their facebook page

[PROOF](http://i.imgur.com/LpvXqSP.png)

What do you guys think? I think this is pretty f'd up. First time receiving such a blatantly discriminatory comment (not counting jokes from friends lol) and action against me because of my race.

If any of your live in the area you know that cars and trucks park along the street all hours of the day, he screamed at her and asked for her license and registration.  My wife asked why and he told her it didn’t matter, just give them to him.  He then proceeded to write her a ticket for driving on the wrong side of the road.  She then asked to speak to the supervisor since this seemed rather unfair, so the cop huffed off.  At that moment the truck was still there and 10+ cars drove around the truck.  Did those cars get a ticket?  Of course not.  She spoke with the owner and he just went on and on as to why they ended up having to hire cops, blah blah blah.  He said he also has a video camera pointing in the street and tried to bring it up so they could watch the incident, but conveniently he couldn’t get it working.  Basically in the end the owner said it was the cops word against hers as the truck driver couldn’t even vouch if he was moving at that instant or not.


My incident was less severe, but I assumed since the street was clear and you walked away it was okay to go.”  He then says “Well I’m the one directing traffic here, not you.  I never said you could go.”  I just apologized and he gave me a few more choice words about how he’s the shit, then let me go.


This cop is absolute douche canoe, there’s no way this can hold up, but regardless it’s a hassle.

I'll go in order of things that angered me.

The traffic/parking there is always terrible there

The line to get in was substantially longer than it needed to be. I felt like the TSA was running security there. Pat down? Lift up your pants? Show your waist? Take everything out of my pockets? Take off my hat? I saw a girl literally turn her purse upside down and dump everything onto the ground in frustration. She just left it all lying there and walked in. 

The beer prices are expected to be terrible at these places

Other than that everything was excellent except for the Woodlands noise ordinance which made the concert end at 10:20, screaming, distorted guitar and booming drums (see Thickfreakness) . I play louder music in my office. 

Again guys, but this time I will. I am never going back to the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion....Except maybe if Daft Punk played, then I guess I would have to go.

I would love it if someone had any info on parts being sold or the car itself. Thanks a lot if you have any info and thanks a lot to the emailer who reminded me to post it here on reddit.

A few weeks ago, lowering costs. I picked up a box, and wow, I was impressed. I got a huge box full of zucchini, beets, lettuce, kale, peaches, plums

They offer pickup Tuesdays, and eats a raw vegan diet every day, and teaches others how to prepare their food in such a way.

I'm very much a meat eater

Anyhow

Because of this, our call was initially qualified by 911 dispatch as a generic low-level disturbance, which is logged but not broadcast over the radio to the HPD.  When I called back and told dispatch my husband had a loaded weapon, this obviously moved our call up the priority list and it was then transmitted over police radio.  They were essentially unaware of our situation until after the second call - this is what caused multiple police cars to arrive simultaneously.

Concerning the private property v. public roadways discussion

So really our only recourse at this point is to sue for damages to our property

I hope this information is useful

So Ernesto is tracking right to the gulf, and FL.  He's tracking fast, but if he hits us it's still a week out.

Also

Some people got butthurt with the south park reference in my last title.  Suck it.  You live in Houston, and don't let your fuel tank get below half full.  If you're especially preparation-oriented, get a generator and a trifuel kit so you can hook it to your natural gas.  That pretty much never goes out.
