Today I can reveal that it is indeed Quentin Skinner!

I will come back with a post where I invite you to post your questions -- for now I just wanted to share the good news

Until then -- here's a [**collection of previously posted**](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/search?q=skinner&amp;restrict_sr=on) links about Skinner

***
&gt; **Quentin Robert Duthie Skinner** (born 26 November 1940, University of London. 

&gt; Professor Skinner is the author or co-author of more than 20 books, the Balzan Prize (2006) and the Bielefelder Wissenschaftspreis (2008).  

&gt; He has been the recipient of honorary degrees from 12 leading Universities, Harvard and Oxford.  He is a Fellow of the British Academy, the Royal Historical Society and the Academia Europea, and is a foreign member of the national academies of Austria, Ireland, Italy and the United states.  

&gt; His scholarship is available in 24 languages

&gt; **The 'Cambridge School'**

&gt; He is generally regarded as one of the two principal members of the influential 'Cambridge School' of the study of the history of political thought. The 'Cambridge School' is best known for its attention to the 'languages' of political thought and the contextual focus this gives its distinctive blend of intellectual history and the history of political thought. Skinner's particular contribution was to articulate a theory of interpretation which concentrated on recovering the 'speech acts' embedded in the 'illocutionary' statements of specific individuals in writing works of political theory (Machiavelli

&gt; One of the consequences of this account of interpretation is an emphasis on the necessity of studying less well-known political writers as a means of shedding light on the classic authors - although it also consciously questions the extent to which it is possible to distinguish 'classic' texts from the contexts, particularly on that of Leo Strauss.

&gt; **Research interests:** Professor Skinner works on early-modern European intellectual history, and about several issues in contemporary political theory, including the concept of political liberty and the character of the State.

So far, and it'll stay that way for the foreseeable future.

However

* Material about the history of ideas (surprisingly)

&gt; &gt; * the study of the history of ideas, of the natural and social sciences, of religion, and of political thought!


* That means it can be about

&gt; &gt; * one or more particular ideas/concepts or ways of thinking, traditions, social or intellectual movements, at a *particular time* in history, or *throughout* history, or

&gt; &gt; * the relevance of any such mentioned above — *today*

* Articles (including PDFs), podcasts, lectures, audiobooks (preferably signified by a [tag]) are welcome



* Explanatory post titles. The original title of the article isn't necessarily the best suited for posting to r/HoI. We're intellectual omnivores



* Many readers prefer to check the comments before clicking the link. If you think your link is worth posting

* If you post a scholarly article

* The convention I use for book titles when posting reviews is 'Title of the Book' (2013)

* For further guidance and inspiration

I suppose that is all.

I

Hinduism is one of the world's oldest religions. Statistically

These are simple facts about Hinduism as a world religion today.  However

Some interesting details about Hinduism:  

* It is more a philosophy than a religion.  Hinduism is a set of guidelines to lead a righteous and devout life.  
* Hinduism is not a conquest oriented religion.  There is no system of conversion. Any believers/followers are free to choose Hinduism as a way of life. They simply need to put into practice what Hinduism explains.
* Hinduism has a pantheon of Gods and Goddesses and the number is rumored to be 330 Million. Some count that.
* Hinduism lends it's name to India. The other names India is known by are **Bharat** after a legendary emperor of India and **Hindustan**

Hindu Mythology is rich and varied. Going into the details, The Mahabharata and The Ramayana.  The Sacred Text for all Hindus is the Bhagwad Gita which is a beautiful composition believed to be recited by Lord Krishna, one of the Avatars of Lord Vishnu to Prince Arjuna.

We will embark on a journey and discuss these characters

We shall have 6 lectures as part of this series.  I will post my first lecture tomorrow and we shall continue discussions on the lecture for one week till the next lecture is online.  As and when the lectures are posted online

In order to account for reader interest

(I promise to be less over-the-top with metaphor in the actual course)

The French Revolution was a series of events equal parts fascinating, is history condensed and sped up. Political and cultural changes which have taken decades to centuries in other places took their course in the six years from 1789 to 1795, and the aftershocks of those changes could be felt in French society and politics for almost a hundred years after the first Revolution died down.

My course will include a short analysis of the events which led up to the French Revolution, there will also be a particular focus on revolutionary ideas and movements and how they influenced the course of political, economic and social change.

The Revolution has also led to a huge and diverse range of academic analysis, to the immediate lead up to the Revolution from 1785 - 1789, to the course of the Revolution and its attempt to restructure society 1789 - 1795, as well as historiography of the Revolution and revolutionary ideas and movements.

Why study the French Revolution? Because it offers a significant insight into the nature of humanity. It encompasses all the extremes of political thought, I hold on to the hope that someone, somewhere will learn a profound lesson from those extraordinary times.

The theme of this documentary revolves heavily around the school of philosophical thought known as existentialism, although the term had not been coined at the time of Nietzsche's writing, and Heidegger declaimed the label. The documentary is named after the 1878 book written by Nietzsche, titled Human, All Too Human: A Book for Free Spirits.

&gt; Each episode runs at 60 minutes

&gt; The first episode is titled **[Beyond Good and Evil](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-184240591461103528)**, and finally to insanity. His sister presented the National Socialists (Nazis) with heavily modified versions of Nietzsche's writings that were interpreted as a pro-Nazi agenda; to advance the superior race of the Übermensch, the ""superman"", the perfect Aryan.

&gt; **[Thinking the Unthinkable](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-858369328131624007)** is the next episode that centers around Martin Heidegger, his works were dismissed by his critics as Nazi propaganda.

&gt; The final episode in this series, Jean-Paul Sartre. This is when the term existentialism begins to enter the realm of philosophy. The documentary shows that Sartre believes it is up to each individual human being to give his or her own life a meaning and a purpose.

Here's some info from the [presentation post](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/105a5l/in_two_weeks_time_rhistoryofideas_that_means_you/):

&gt; **Quentin Robert Duthie Skinner** (born 26 November 1940, University of London.

&gt; Professor Skinner is the author or co-author of more than 20 books, the Balzan Prize (2006) and the Bielefelder Wissenschaftspreis (2008).

&gt; He has been the recipient of honorary degrees from 12 leading Universities, Harvard and Oxford. He is a Fellow of the British Academy, the Royal Historical Society and the Academia Europea, and is a foreign member of the national academies of Austria, Ireland, Italy and the United states.

&gt; His scholarship is available in 24 languages

&gt; **The 'Cambridge School'**

&gt; He is generally regarded as one of the two principal members of the influential 'Cambridge School' of the study of the history of political thought. The 'Cambridge School' is best known for its attention to the 'languages' of political thought and the contextual focus this gives its distinctive blend of intellectual history and the history of political thought. Skinner's particular contribution was to articulate a theory of interpretation which concentrated on recovering the 'speech acts' embedded in the 'illocutionary' statements of specific individuals in writing works of political theory (Machiavelli

&gt; One of the consequences of this account of interpretation is an emphasis on the necessity of studying less well-known political writers as a means of shedding light on the classic authors - although it also consciously questions the extent to which it is possible to distinguish 'classic' texts from the contexts, particularly on that of Leo Strauss.

&gt; **Research interests:** Professor Skinner works on early-modern European intellectual history, and about several issues in contemporary political theory, including the concept of political liberty and the character of the State.

* M. Cary and H. H. Scullard, but as I've also restarted my listening to [Mike Duncan's podcast](http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/the_history_of_rome/2007/07/index.html) to compensate, I'm all good.

* Ola Åmodt, if you happen to have any good advice on where to *eat* and *sleep* in Rome, that'd be great... 

* Antonio Gramsci

* Hans Jonas, I really wonder whether the rest of the book can deliver anything either new or necessary for his thesis. It's from 1979, so possibly the subsequent wave of environmentalism have made most of his arguments common sense? Not that this has had enough of an effect on real policy and behaviour, though...

~~As I'm leaving for a 2-week holiday in a few days, or Erving Goffman's [*The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Presentation_of_Self_in_Everyday_Life). I'd be grateful for any advice...~~

Ended up bringing H. H. Scullard's [*From the Gracchi to Nero: A History of Rome 133 BC to AD 68*](http://www.amazon.com/Gracchi-Nero-History-Routledge-Classics/dp/0415584884/)
Marcel Mauss' [*The Gift*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gift_%28book%29)

I'll start:

* I've recently started reading a copy of Milton Erikson's [*Young Man Luther, with Erikson's brand of mid-20th century psychoanalysis. The two complement each other surprisingly well.

* I've also made it to midway through Milton's [*Paradise Lost

* That interest in the English language also led me to oddities like [William Barnes'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barnes) book [*An Outline of English Speechcraft, but strangely beautiful, and it goes well with the poems of [Gerard Manley Hopkins.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Manley_Hopkins)

* That's all led me to an interest in the High Modernist writers of the 20th century, once I have a break from classes, I'm hoping to tackle Joyce's [*Ulysses.*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_%28novel%29)

I plan to go through some of the major topics that I think are very misunderstood or just really interesting. The outline of my course is below

* **History of Haiti** - It is really more interesting (and fucked up) than you'd think

* **Vodou/Voodoo** - Strong female leadership

* **The People** - Being Haitian is more than just being poor and living in a tent city. I promise.

* **The Republic of NGOs** - The international presence in Haiti or in other words what happened to that $10 you texted after the earthquake?

* **Top Hats

* **Haiti's Future** - Hope



**Edit just to provide some more information:**
This will be part of the new History of Ideas Academy courses. The idea is that scholars, make comments, and request anything related to the topic that you're interested in. Once it begins you can follow the entire course or just check in on the week you find most interesting. You can check the right hand side of the HOI subreddit at any time to see what courses are going on. 

The format of my course will be a post each week on the relevant topic along with links to photos I've taken and suggestions for further reading. Then

And in case you're wondering, politics, religion, kinship, language, etc. in order to put it in context. Looking at just one aspect out of context can result in a flawed understanding of the situation and poor decisions if you're trying to fix it (as is evidenced by some of the UN, USAID, you have to understand what is wrong before you can fix it. But more than that, and a fascinating culture.

Take the Old Testament. The common idea is that during the time it was written

For example the ""light"" spoken of in Genesis. Somehow there seems to be an agreement that its early meaning or at least understanding was that of physical light, this light is taken also to mean good deeds, in explicit reference to the bible; from there it gets interpreted as the neoplatonic essence of world and man – and so on through the development of various exegetical methods.

My point is: Do we know for sure whether people ever read the bible only literally? If so

He looked for a scribe and Lord Ganesha agreed to undertake the task. He laid a condition that Vyasa would never stop reciting. Vyasa agreed on the condition that Ganesha wouldn't write down anything without first understanding it.
So began this marvellous journey of complex and intricate poetry and diction and understanding and penmanship.
It is said that Vyasa deliberately constructed increasingly complicated verses when he wanted a breather so that he could think about the next one.

Some facts about the Mahabharata:

It consists of 18 books or Parvas.
It is the story of the struggle between cousins which includes several undercurrents in the form of lust, anger and all the known human vices.

The primary characters in the Epic are Krishna
The other characters are their families and supporters.

I look forward to your responses. I have not turned this into a lecture as such because the Mahabharat is very vast and in itself would take weeks to fully do justice to.

Buddhism

Hinduism is also known by the names Sanatana-Dharma(The eternal Law) and Vaidika-Dharma. (Vedic Law)  
Sanatana-Dharma means eternal religion. Hinduism is as old as the world itself. Hinduism is said to be the mother of all religions. Hindu scriptures are the oldest in the world, but also because it is protected by God and because it can make us eternal.  

Vaidika-Dharma means the religion of the Vedas. The Vedas are the foundational scriptures of Hinduism. The ancient Rishis and sages of India have expressed their intuitive spiritual experiences (Aparoksha-Anubhuti) in the Upanishads. These experiences are direct and infallible. 
Hinduism regards the spiritual experiences of the Rishis of yore as its authority. The priceless truths that have been discovered by the Hindu Rishis and sages through millennia constitute the glory of Hinduism. Therefore

These are the words of Swami Sivananda.  

**Who is a Hindu?**

In a meeting of the Sanatana Dharma Sabha
The Hindu Maha Sabha has given another definition: “A Hindu is one who believes in a religion which has originated in India.”


**HINDU RELIGION**

“Those who burn the dead are Hindus.” This is another definition given by some.
“He who protects the cows and the Brahmins is a Hindu.” This is another definition given by some.  

Some define: “A Hindu is one who regards India as his motherland and the most sacred spot on earth.”  

Some others define: “He who calls and considers himself a Hindu is a Hindu.”
Some define: “He who accepts the Vedas, and believes in one Supreme God (Brahman), in the Law of Karma or retributive justice, and in reincarnation (Punarjanma), is a Hindu.”  

“He who follows the Vedic or Sanatana-Dharma is a Hindu.” This is the definition by some.  

“He who is a follower of the Vedanta is a Hindu.” This is another definition given by some others.  

“He who has perfect faith in the Law of Karma, Varnashrama Dharma (The system with 4 Varnas or castes), Vedas and existence of God, he who practises the instructions given in the Vedas with faith and earnestness, he who does Sandhya (Oblations and Prayer),  Sraaddha (Last Rites), Pitri-Tarpana(Water Oblations to God) and the Pancha-Maha-Yajnas(5 Great Sacrifices), he who worships the Avataras and studies the Vedas


**Origin:**

That part of the great Aryan race which migrated from Central Asia, now called the Indus, on the other side of the river. The Persians pronounced the word Sindhu as Hindu, and named their Aryan brethren Hindus. Hindu is only a corrupt form of Sindhu.
The Hindu Aryans spread themselves over the plains of the Ganga. Then the Persians gave the name Hindustan
The classical name for India which is used in Sanskrit literature is Bharata-Varsha(Varsha = Country) or Bharata-Khanda (Khanda = Province)
is Aryavarta
Hindu is not a mere name. This name Hindu is not only of geographical

All our ideas and ideals are so intimately connected with it that it is difficult to give a simple definition of it. Poets, nobility, generosity, philosophy, religious bent of mind, Yoga, religious tolerance, devotion

These are some basic facts related to the Religion.  I would like this to be more of a discussion post as philosophy is vast and however much I post

I hope this will be an active discussion and I'm looking forward to all your views and comments.

* **1** - [**Global reach**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/sep/28/calvin-christian-church)  
Calvin's influence is still being felt today. But the reformer was a complex man

* **2** - [**A practical theology**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/oct/05/calvin-christian-theology)  
Calvin taught that Christianity is not genuine if its ideas 'flit in the brain'

* **3** - [**Knowledge of God and of ourselves**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/oct/12/calvin-theology-religion-institutes)  
Calvin's basic idea about human nature is that it is innately religious and that mankind is in rebellion against its creator

* **4** - [**Word and spirit**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/oct/19/calvin-reformation-theology-spirit)  
Calvin was against the idea that it's possible to meet God half way

* **5** - [**Predestination**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/oct/25/religion-philosophy)  
Calvin's doctrine of predestination was not a mania. It was the only alternative to a God who plays dice

* **6** - [**The world**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/nov/02/calvin-theology-philosophy)  
People have a picture of Calvin as an unrelenting puritan. But he is also strongly sensitivity to human liberty

* **7** - [**Heresy and death**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/nov/06/calvin-church-state-servetus)  
Calvin thought natural knowledge of God makes us inexcusable. That makes his own part in the death of Servetus inexcusable

* **8** - [**The legacy**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/nov/13/calvinism-calvin-legacy-influence)  
Would Calvin have recognised or welcomed Calvinism? What are the elements of his teachings that are still alive?

[**Walter Kaufmann**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Kaufmann_%28philosopher%29)'s wiki page


--------------------------------------

**Set of 3 lectures from 1960:**

------------------------------------------

* [Kierkegaard and the Crisis in Religion](http://www.archive.org/details/KierkegaardAndTheCrisisInReligion)

&gt; Dr. Walter Kaufmann begins this series by explaining that existentialists share as many differences as other schools of philosophy. First coined to refer to the theories of Jaspers and Heidegger, and Nietzsche all radical individualists who found previous philosophical systems lacking. He explains their writings as an answer to the modern crisis in religious philosophy and morality.

* [Nietzsche and the Crisis in Philosophy](http://www.archive.org/details/NietzscheAndTheCrisisInPhilosophy)^1

&gt; Dr. Walter Kaufmann focuses on the contribution of Friedrich Nietzsche to the philosophical world, and ultimately, his madness, ascribed to having ""burned himself out.""

* [Sartre and the Crisis in Morality](http://www.archive.org/details/SartreAndTheCrisisInMorality)

&gt; Since it has not kept up with the results of science, in this examination of Sartre, suggests the breakdown of morals, institutionalized anonymity, permissiveness, and the population explosion have brought us to a crucial point of decision. This was forseen by the existentialists who did not share the vast optimism about scientific progress. The work of Sartre and Heidegger is contrasted along with a discussion of Jaspers and Tillich. He suggests both Sartre and Camus failed to alleviate the current moral vacuum.



---------------------------------------


**A lecture from 1973:**

-----------------------------------------

* [Prof. Kaufmann discusses Sartre, Kierkegaard](http://www.archive.org/details/Prof.KaufmannDiscussesSartreJaspersHeideggerKierkegaard)

&gt; Dr. Walter Kaufmann explores the origins, and relation to Christianity of existentialism, illustrating with Kierkegaard, Jaspers, Heidegger, and Sartre in comparison to empiricism, rationalism

*The idea is to discuss a topic that came up in one ore more recent posts in r/HoI but not to limit the discussion on that original post but instead to open it up for further ideas and contributions.*

*Also

*I plan to have this discussion visible for some time

**This week's topic: ""Are you certain?"":**

Inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/1k6zfr/podcast_deborah_black_joins_peter_adamson_to_talk/) submission by /u/Qwill2


- What does it mean to be absolute certain of something as an individual? What are neurological, religious etc. implications?



- What is interrsubjective or social certainty? What are some moral implications? E.g. the death penalty (""We are certain



- How does certainty and security go together? (War on terror

- Is lying for the sake of security justified? (Iraq war

- What is the connection between knowledge and certainty? 

- What function does certainty fulfil in the discourse of science and humanities?


This topic also touches other thinkers that have appeared frequently in HoI:


**example #1:**

- “All good things were at one time bad things; every original sin has
developed into an original virtue.” *Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900)

- [more on Nietzsche and knowledge](http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie/vol9/Nietzsche.html)

**example #2:**

- H. Arendt and Derrida [on witnessing](http://psc.sagepub.com/content/37/6/629.short)

and of course

**example #3:**

- L. Wittgenstein


There are, yet concrete enought to get an enlightening discussion going.

So

Where do you see similarities and differences

How would you feel as a witness (Derrida/Arendt) in a trial that could result in death penalty?

What would you reply if Nietzsche told you to be the source of your own certainty?

1352646743.0,130evn,[HoI Course] - Hindu Religion and Mythology - [HinduMyth 6/6],srx_god,16,4,0,"As the last lecture on this series

Let's start with the name Diwali. Also called Deepavali in some parts
Let's elaborate some more.  There have been multiple significant events in Hinduism that need to be commemorated.  From our past lectures, the Pandavas, ended their period of exile to return and stake their claim to the kingdom of Indraprastha.  It is also the festival which celebrates the death of Narakasura.  Unlike most christian festivals which celebrate births, most Hindu festivals celebrate deaths. Dassehra, Diwali etc.  

Talking about these old texts.  The books that we read today are highly sensitized and they try to gloss over many 'facts' or let's just say they try to mould it so that it fits with the poets world view for whichever era he wrote the text in.
For eg, though young and untested ascended owing to Bhishma's vow of relinquishing all claims to any kingship.  Bhisma fought and won him 3 wives. Amba, Ambika and Ambalika. This wasn't uncommon. A king could rightfully stake claim to wives in this manner.  He defeats the armies of the defending father in law after all. Fruits of war.  Amba however, had a thing on the side going with the King of Salva. Bhishma hence, turned her loose. Amba went running to the King of her heart. The king, enraged at Bhishma and doubting her chastity, turned her down. It might also have been a result of male ego. We can never know for sure can we?  Consumed with Rage, my vow will be upheld. Also

Here's the interesting part. Our translations tell us that he LOOKED upon them once and they were with child. Truth is, was blind from birth.  Ambalika though frightened too, turned pale and as a result, her son Pandu was born pale and weak. When Ambika was asked to get on the merry go round a 2nd time, she sent her maid instead. The maid was unabashed and went whole heartedly. She had a son Vidura who was the best amongst the 3. Wisest man and advisor to Pandu and then Dhritarashtra after him.
Remember how the Pandavas were born? The 5 gods? Yeah. Ring a bell doesn't it?  

Similar to Bhishma, popular Gods in Hinduism. Hanuman. The son of the wind. We might even go as far as to call him the first ever superhero. There are several aspects of Hanuman which endear him and are the reason why he is immensely respected. He is the greatest friend, most loyal servant and fiercest enemy. He never did wrong and accorded due respect to his enemies, even on the battlefield when faced with death. It is even believed that Hanuman is not dead. It is said he is immortal and that he lives in the mountains and the lucky few who have accumulated enough juice through years of penance and righteousness are gifted with a sighting.  

There are several instances in Hindu mythology where Gods are shown as lecherous. Take for instance, there are several instances like with Indra and Ahilya (you can check the story out on Wiki) where Gods are enchanted by beauty and just can't help themselves. Ditto with Anjani and Marut (Parents of Hanuman).
This might strike you as very similar to several stories from Greek Mythology. Like the birth of Hercules. The tryst between Indra and Ahilya has several parallels with the affair between Zeus and Alcmene. Both imitated the woman's husbands and the difference is

There are several accounts of such illicit sexual transactions carried out by horny Devas. Indra in particular. If viewed purely as a character

In today's society

Another great point to note is the mastery of the authors in enforcing a point of view upon the readers. When we read the Ramayan or the Mahabharata
Here are a couple of incidents I'd like to point out.  

Rama is comparatively pretty straightforward. He has little or no room for straying from the path of righteousness. However

Remember the training of the Pandavas? How Bhishma and Arjuna would repeatedly make fun of the Kauravas? It's a subtext. It can even be said to be a commentary on current times. If the Pandavas were present day

Krishna, the clay elephant was beheaded to fool Drona. He ignored battle code of conduct while Karna was trying to free his Chariot and also cheated by blocking the sun (Yes, they DID fight in the shade) when Jayadratha was to be slain. Here, you find several points in the story where you could really choose to pick a side, but the author, masterly provides the right justification, time and again. Note how all the characters have shades of gray, the Mahabharata is much darker than the Ramayan.    

I would suggest that you pick up Ashok Banker's version of the Ramayan and read till book 6. This is a brilliant adaptation and thoroughly entertaining. Just till book 6 however. After that

Ravana himself is originally said to be handsome and resplendant. He is a monster only by virtue and deed. Not appearance. He was also known as Sundar Ravana or Beautiful Ravana. There are several good parts to him too. He might've abducted Sita

As of today

To end this post and summarily, when kids go berserk with firecrackers and strut around wearing new clothes. In my mind, it's not about who died or who lived. It's about spreading cheer. Watching dozens of people come together to light the country up even though it's only once a year.  What I like best about Diwali is that it doesn't matter what religion you follow, you celebrate it. I celebrate Diwali, Id and Christmas with gusto. Also tried to sneak into a Parsi fire temple on Pateti but got a stern warning and was told not to try such stunts again. (My bad). I just love reading and trying to understand what goes into each religion. I'm not sure how to classify myself. But yes, I find my lack of faith disturbing. (Kudos Lord Vader). But watching other people who have faith and belief comforts me and I try to find that something which I can believe in.

Till then, criticised and commented, thank you very much. It's been a pleasure to have interacted with all of you. I wish you all a very happy Diwali and all other festivals to come.

Cheers!

This is srx_god signing off on Hinduism. (Atleast for now)

Hello all

Find it on youtube:
http://youtu.be/c0r4TgksHSM0

Please make comments here on reddit.

This time I talk about:
What is religion? Is it really a cross cultural universal? Where do the modern European words for religion--from the German ""religion"" to the Portuguese ""religião""--come from? (Hint: the Latin ""religio""). I also discuss the history of most modern Euro-American terms for religion and gesture at the double-abstraction which has produced the modern category of religion. 

Hope you enjoy!

This is my second last lecture on Hindu Mythology.  Here is a link to read up on Hinduism's view on the afterlife.  

http://www.dlshq.org/download/afterdeath.htm  

I'd like to point out a few things.

Like the ancient River Styx in Greek Mythology
Hinduism refers to multiple levels of hell. Each hell performing a specific function of purgatory for the sinners based upon their sins.
Hindus believe in the concept of Karma where a soul has to pay for it's actions. In Hinduism
After a cycle of 7 births and deaths

Hindus perform last rites for the dead in order to ensure that they are provided for in the journey to the halls of Yama who is the God of Death.
Offerings of rice, clothing and convenience for the dead in their journey across the Vaitarni.

The link has a lot more detail and discusses many points.  Again
I invite discussion and would really appreciate any and all questions so that we may expand on topics that do interest you.",self,t5_2swgc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/12pxhi/hoi_course_hindu_religion_the_hindu_concept_of/

If you have not been following along you can see the outline [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/10dk1n/haiti_today_teaser_for_upcoming_course/)

This lecture tries to get at what it means to live in Haiti through the lenses of gender, and economy. It is by no means a complete view despite its length, but hopefully it will provide you with a general understanding of the island nation that goes beyond what you see on the news. If you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below and we'll have a discussion.
