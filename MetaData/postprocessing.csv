So happy that there is an active interest in this!  
I am by no means a pro - I'm actually studying to be a librarian
Split toning techniques are used to obtain different colours for the highlight and shadow areas of your images.  
I must confess that I love it a bit too much. Once I began shooting RAW and using Lightroom
It is an old film effect, when film photographers decided to use sepia toning, they found their image to have not completely bleached and this left a multi toned style image which was given the name split toning.^1  
It is simple to use
Split toning can be used to quickly and dramatically enhance an image

**It is most often used for three purposes:**  

* [Simulating Toning upon Monochrome Images](http://i.imgur.com/Q2xAO.jpg)

* [Getting that Cross-Processed

* [Correcting Stubborn Color Casts](http://i.imgur.com/AJN0Y.jpg)

There seems to be a lot of confusion about how [these double exposure portraits](http://www.christofferrelander.com/projects/we-are-nature/) were created. Most are slamming it as a simple Photoshop

I went out to duplicate the effect after work this evening: [example 1](http://www.flickr.com/photos/biehl/7682103690/) &amp; [example 2](http://www.flickr.com/photos/biehl/7682103354/). This was all [in camera with RAW and Lightroom/ACR. ](http://i.imgur.com/5RC3T.jpg) It doesn't require adjustment brushes

**In Camera How to Guide:**

Note: This is just a rough first draft of the tutorial. I may take a more in-depth stab at it (and other alternatives) if people take interest in this post.

You will need a copy of Lightroom or Photoshop. My examples are using LR v4.1; but you should be able to duplicate these edits in ACR

You'll need a camera that can take multiple exposure photos. I'm using a D800 image for this example


1. First you will need to setup the camera to take a double exposure (for Nikons: Menu-&gt; Shooting Menu -&gt; Multiple Exposures). This mode will add light values together to make the final exposure (e.g. 50% gray exposure + %50 gray exposure will create a final image of white). Note: make sure any 'Auto Gain' or similar auto modes turned off (It will muck with the in camera exposure blending and you may loose the masking effect). You may also want to shoot in Manual mode to keep exposures consistent.  

2. For the first exposure

3. For the second exposure

4. Now you should be able to view the multiple exposure image in camera. Rinse and repeat step #2 &amp; #3 until you have some keepers. 

4. Import images into Adobe Camera Raw or Lightroom. 

5. [Convert the image to B&amp;W and tone to taste.](http://i.imgur.com/XxUmh.png) You may want to clip the highlights a little to clean up the borders and any area that  have exposure issues. 

6. Now you need to adjust the 'Tone Curve'. Using a custom point curve

7. Finally

You should end up with something [simlar to this.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/biehl/7682795464)


**Edit: Quick Photoshop How To...**

&gt;unfortunately some of us can't do multiple exposures... is there an easy way to do this without using that method?

Shoot the images separately in the same manner as above. Stack the images in Photoshop and set the top layer to 'Screen' or 'Add'/'Linear Dodge' blend mode. Then apply a[ B&amp;W adjustment layer,False,self,t5_2smai,1375113111.0,,,t3_xfqxe

I also encourage you to use this thread to share your own light painted photos along with a little info as to how you shot and edited them.


----------------------------------------------------


First a few basics:

-You're going to need a dark location without a lot of ambient lighting

-You will of course need a bright handheld light to paint your subject

-To get a decent shot you're going to need a decent tripod

{If you do get a few small differences due to movement between exposures you can use Photoshop's ""load files into stack"" script (File&gt;Scripts)

-Be sure to set your white balance to match the color of your painting light, but in this case you can use your light to paint a virtual white card a few feet in front of the lens.

-You will need to figure out how long of an exposure you can take at the location you've chosen

-It helps to wear dark clothing so that you don't end up in the shot

-Unless you want them in your shot be sure to watch out for light trails coming from your painting light when it's facing the camera or reflecting on your subject

-Light as much as you can in each exposure to reduce the amount of blending you'll have to do in post but at the same time make sure you don't ""nuke"" or completely overexpose any areas.

-Make sure you have a lot of time to get the shot and it always helps to have a few friends with you if you're shooting in a not so safe part of town(which is where the best locations always seem to be)

-I'm sure I've forgotten a few so if I remember any I'll be sure to add them.

The following photos where made using [this light](http://www.amazon.com/Cooper-Lighting-LED130-Might-D-Light-Rechargeable/dp/B002T4AEGK/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1330238238&amp;sr=8-5)

If you followed the tips above then you should be ready to shoot! 

The Harley picture was made from three shots and the others were made up of anywhere from 7 to 20 shots each. I first take a long exposure of the scene without any light to get my ""background"" shot, side top, front top, front bottom, wheels, hood, roof

I've found that the hardest part of most cars to light is the hood, I freaking love em. On the other end dark and reflective cars are a huge pain, however when they're done right the resulting photos can be amazing!

So now that you're done shooting and you've packed up all your gear and walked the area to make sure you didn't leave anything behind(I learned that one the hard way) you get to head home for the ""not so fun"" part.

In Photoshop I load all the layers and, then I use layer masks to bring in just the areas I want from each layer. In the BMW shot I didn't change the blending mode and on the other shots I used a combination of ""lighten"" or ""screen"". I'm still trying to figure out which method works best for me but I have noticed that when using ""lighten"" you might get some faint borders along the newly lit areas and with ""screen"" you will be doubling up on any stray colors in the paint caused from ambient lighting during the shoot. You want to get a nicely exposed car with little to no light trails, easier said than done but you'll get the hang of it and develop your own techniques after doing a few.

After I'm happy with the blending I merge them all together and do a little cleanup with the ""cloning"" and ""healing brush/patch"" tools, painted lines or trash from the concrete as well as any sign/light poles or other background elements that might be too distracting. Then using a combination of the ""brightness and contrast"" and ""levels"" adjustments and some masking I try to smooth out the lighting and bring out or hide details in both the car and background. These are usually set to a ""luminosity"" blending mode so they don't interfere with the color. 

Next I use ""hue and saturation"" and ""color balance"" adjustments to tone down distracting reflections and get the overall color I want for the shot

Finally I'll add a little sharpening, and resize/watermark/save the photo. I then proceed to whore it out on forums, Reddit, and Facebook :P

Light painting is also a great way to get evenly exposed product shots and the best part is you can usually get away with a single shot if the item your shooting isn't too big which means less or no time spent editing. Here are a few that I've done.

These were shot with a small led flashlight similar to [this one.](http://www.amazon.com/Super-Bright-Heavy-Duty-Compact-Aluminum-Flashlight/dp/B000LIQQ7M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1330238227&amp;sr=8-1) Find an area to shoot where you can shut out all the lighting

Just wanted to share one super quick way that I use to add contrast in Photoshop. 

**Tutorial:** http://imgur.com/a/8LY9y

* 1.) Open image in Photoshop.

* 2.) Create new Hue/Saturation adjustment layer.

* 3.) Set adjustment layer to Soft Light blending mode.

* 4.) Adjust opacity/lightness/saturation. 

* (Try out the different channels as well!)



BONUS! (Easy little color grade): Select Colorize in the Hue/Sat adjustment panel and mess with those settings. Try something like Hue:40 Sat: 15: Lightness: 0

Settings: http://i.imgur.com/En78WEH.png 

Result: http://i.imgur.com/D1lWXkd.jpg

Hope this helps! :)


P.S.-Try different layer blending modes as well. O and different adjustment layers w/ blending modes. You never know what you'll figure out by just messing around! :)

1360752048.0,18ft89,My Two Year Project,Ovaltine-Jenkins,34,3,22,"I have always loved the look of Kodachrome film.  I grew up looking at the beautiful images on the pages of my Grandmother's old copies of the National Geographic.  

Upon diving into digital photography several years ago I have looked for ways to emulate those tones and colors.  I found Alienskin and used that for a while, too contrasty.

I then found some presets from the X-Equals (then Life In Digital...I believe) which, aqua, magenta, and purple in the Kodachrome 64 variety.

I became slightly disheartened until very recently.  The advent of Lightroom 4 was a giant leap forward with its ability to change the individual R, comparing images I knew to be shot on Kodachrome to my own digital work as I fiddled with my sliders.  The last piece of the puzzle was when I discovered a digital DNG recipe that had been color matched on a chart.  This seemed to be the last piece.

So this is the accumulation of a couple of years of work to try and get a preset that resembles Kodachrome.  I have four presets, the third lowers contrast slightly and tweaks the curve more, and the fourth is just the third but with a slight brown of split toning added to the shadows.

I'm going to guess that these really don't look like Kodachrome, or ideas you have would be welcome!  Thanks for looking!

As it turns out, while fill only works only on the content of the layer. Changing the fill will not change the opacity of any effects that layer might have.  In the video, Natalia creates a light flare effect on a model, by blending a brush to color dodge, then reducing the fill.

One of the most tedious tasks in photography is coming home with more than 500 photos from a shoot
 
My first pass through will usually be heavy on deleting. I'll hit x to mark the most clearly bad (out of focus
 
Next I'll go to the filters bar
 
This pass through
 
Here is how I decide to rate photos:
 
x: Rejected
 
0: No reason to delete this photo. Not artistic and you might not ever do anything with it, but not bad enough to delete.
 
1: Good photos. Well composed, these will be included if they want a ton of photos to look through.
 
2: These photos are the best of each set. Ie
 
3: Great photos. This is a little more arbitrary, they'll be all 3s.
 
4: Excellent photos. I only pick a couple of these
 
5: The best photos. I reseverve a rating of 5 for the best of the best out of the entire project. A photo rated 5 will be worthy of being in the collecton of the best photos I've ever taken.
 
So I make a couple more passes through the library this way, then not rated at least 3 so I get things rated pretty well.
 
At this point I'll see how many photos I have in each catigory

It's something I've noticed before, it looks much worse in Chrome.  I'll admit I don't really know anything about color profiles, beyond the fact that ""color profiles"" is a thing, and assuredly involves profiles of color.

In this pic as posted online, it's clear.  How do I get on the web to look like it does for me when I processed it?

[side-by-side](http://i.imgur.com/CYqNL.jpg): http://i.imgur.com/CYqNL.jpg

When looking at the ""save for web"" options, terrible).  So which color profile do I trust?  Photoshop's uncorrected one, or what Windows thinks it should be?  Which is going to be closer to what everyone else sees?  

**Edit**: So if I take a *screen grab* of the open image, right?

I hope this is the right place to ask this question. 

I recently started working with a professional model on a one on one basis and I've done about 4 shoots with her within the last month and thankfully it's a paid gig.

She really likes my photos but she always asks for specific things to be ""photoshopped"" she's been in the industry for about 15+ years working with all kinds of magazines and catalogs big and small so I trust her opinion but at the same I feel at a loss. I'm not very experienced with photoshop

I mostly edit in adobe Lightroom 3 and use presets to the results I see fit.

How do I get better at photoshop and making my photos look more up to the ""industry standard""?

I get that that is kind of a loaded question.. And I know that a lot has to with lighting

Hopefully this doesn't get downvoted into oblivion. Just a young photographer looking for some help. 

Thanks!



**EDIT:** sorry about not responding I've been at work all day and I have two jobs so it's been a little hectic. I'll definitely add some specific photos of mine and what I'm looking for or who I think embodies work I'd like mine to eventually be at at least on a post processing level.

I'm a California resident and will be at work till midnight so I'll make another edit later tonight. 

Thank you all so much!

[Another photo she likes in skin tones](http://imgur.com/JrVJS)


Just to clarify a little... she likes the skin tones. How they look ""equal"" more or less around the whole body. The coloring of the skin and how it looks the same all over. Personally I don't see it exactly

My photos she just wanted basic touch ups.
That I have no problem... Cloning and such.

It's just the skin tones issue I'm not very good at I guess.

* **CPU**: important for speed of rendering and export; ~~number of cores matters less than speed of the processor~~ [NoisyZenMaster](http://www.reddit.com/r/postprocessing/comments/zigp2/things_to_know_in_buildingpurchasing_a/c64v6il) keeps me honest: # of cores does matter for preview rendering and mass developer changes; 64-bit support is important for more RAM  
* **RAM**: go for capacity (8GB+); 64-bit OS for higher capacity (also varies among 64-bit OS options; eg. Home Basic vs. Premium)  
* **SSD**: helps minimize bottleneck caused by hard-disk storage performance; install OS (disable pagefile and hiberfil
* **GPU**: LR and PS6 is not really impacted by this
* **Monitor**: critical since it's your main interface
* **Storage**: [NoisyZenMaster](http://www.reddit.com/r/postprocessing/comments/zigp2/things_to_know_in_buildingpurchasing_a/c64v6il) adds that extra redundant storage (automated backups) is critical in the long-run; affordable considering low-cost.

I've not been taking pictures for a very long time but I'm already starting to see myself getting stuck in a certain pattern: I take pictures, think the results are okay, save them, play a bit more, save these results as well and am then never sure which pictures I should keep.

That way

So my questions would be:

Do you try to get for a certain result and try everything to achieve this? 
As I said

What do you do with the RAW files after you're done editing?
Should I just delete them so I can consider the photo to be finished?

What's the one thing that should be done to every single photo taken?
I personally find that a bit more contrast and the „s-curve“ improves pretty much any picture I've ever taken (there probably are situations where this doesn't apply but I haven't run into them). So is there any routine you just go through with basically any random photo you've taken? Do you sometimes not do anything and still consider them really worth keeping? 

I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit but since this is more about the postprocessing process rather than the photography itself, of course.

If you've ever dropped by the photography board on 4chan
His informative but somewhat advanced (at least for me) blog can be found at [Photoshop® Archives](http://photoshoparchives.blogspot.com/).  
Last week, (so many post processing goodies there!) but I'm also inserting the 'article' here:

***

&gt; This was a post I made to a thread where someone was stating that they don't post process their image and feel it takes more skill on the part of the photographer to work this way. I told them to post a picture that's straight out of camera and I'm sure I can improve it. They post an image

* Jpeg post processing has a hard time with separation of hue and saturation. There are ways to manipulate how we perceive color and saturation intensity (as long as you understand the theory of color relativity) but this takes a human mind to pull off. All the hues in your image were very red/yellow with a hint of green

* Jpeg sharpening is very unreliable. Sometimes stuff will end up under-sharpened, but this brought out the aliasing. Had I had the raw file to sharpen, this would look leagues more appealing.  

* Composition adjustment by far in my opinion, then saturation), we can fine-tune these to help guide the eye of the viewer to what we feel is the reason we took the picture, prevent their eye from naturally falling on random crap that distracts them, and keep their eyes from leaving the frame so they'll savour the detail and appreciate your image more. In the case of your image I added a subtle vignette to keep the contrast at the edges of the image lower than the middle to discourage them from ""escaping"" out the sides, also slightly decreased the saturation along the frame, removed all the random crap that their eyes would naturally fall on instead of looking at the good stuff (I'll get into more detail regarding this controversial move in a moment), improve compositional lines

* So why would we want to do manipulate the image this way? Isn't removing some of the scratches and stuff cheating? It was there when you took the picture, repetition of shapes/lines...etc), your brain ""defocused"" on the rest of the stuff/details that you weren't specifically looking at. I don't mean that it literally blurred your vision, you probably didn't even notice this was happening. This is why pictures typically have all kinds of stuff that we didn't notice at the time of the shoot (until you've trained yourself to make an effort to look for distractions like branches growing out of heads). Why shouldn't the viewer have the same experience I did when I was actually there? That's why I personally choose to remove compositional snags. If removing the scratches, nicks, and parts sticking out that caught a distracting highlight isn't something you'd do, then just ignore that and look at the other changes I made to your image. (I'm also not mentioning loads of ways our brains correct what we see in real life that isn't corrected by jpeg conversion like perspective and white balance - white balance in camera is good but not nearly as good as manually tweaking the temperature and tint sliders bla bla bla)  

* That's why I said I know I can improve an image that's been post processed by the computer in your camera rather than a human mind. The chances of you presenting an image that doesn't have anything that could be fine-tuned to more closely emulate the experience you had at the time of the shoot is so unlikely that it wasn't worth considering. As technology progresses and cameras become capable of recording higher dynamic ranges, this still wont be able to do the stuff that a good old fashioned human being can do by looking at the image in photoshop and thinking ""so let's see how I can make this picture more like the experience of viewing it in-person...""

Does anybody know how this can be done in using Photoshop? 

I guess there's an obvious aspect of how the initial photograph is taken - for example the time of day the photograph is taken to get an even balance of the colour/brightness of the sky. But I'm also assuming that it won't look nearly as 'clean' when it comes straight out of the camera. Is it just a case of some very well considered gradients?

I got a great response when I posted about some colour 120 negs that I had scanned but I have got a bit confused when trying to do the post work on my recently scanned B&amp;W shots. 

The negs themselves are quite low in contrast and therefore I am struggling slightly to get them looking more natural whilst also keeping detail in the highlights and shadows! 

The negs have also been scanned as 16bit Grey tiffs which has made the layout in PS a little odd as well as suddenly curves seems to be upside and other tools aren't usable at all! 

As per before

Has anyone got any tips on processing these? They obviously start a bit dark due to scanning but I find it really difficult to get the exposure up without losing all the highlights. I was particularly struggling with the group shot in front of the house and the two shot at the table!

http://imgur.com/7TJezfa

I am fairly certain I can achieve an amount of lightning and beautyretouch that suits her needs. What I am really worried about is that gray-blue-ish skintone.. i absolutely have no idea how to achieve that..

What I will be looking at is a gray background that is slightly lid up and a portrait that is lid by a small softbox with grid from above and a bouncer from below. Also there will be a very subtle hairlight.

Hope u guys can help me :D

How did you guys out there in redditland get into post? Would it be valuable for me to learn film processing with the explicit intent of carrying that knowledge over to a digital workflow? Should I prioritize learning that over learning digital post? For instance the Ansel Adams trinity has been on my to-read list for a long while

* Import the images and then do a photomerge to align them.
* Put them in reverse order in the layer stack.  The primary picture goes at the bottom.
* Add a layer mask to each layer except the bottom one (the main image).
* Fill each layer mask with black
* Move your way up from the bottom and paint white in the layer mask to reveal the hands on the next layer.
* You might need to tweak the alignment of individual layers to get it right.  I had to duplicate some layers to put a left hand on one and a right hand on another to get things aligned correctly.

I'm stuck with an image that I took in the [harsh Zambian sun which has left a harsh blow out on the forehead of my subject](http://i.imgur.com/nbJrw.jpg). The image was shot in raw but there isn't much detail to be recovered from using highlight recovery as most of the spot was fully blown out. Here is the shot out of the camera for reference [without recovery](http://i.imgur.com/e5yC1.jpg) and [with 100% recovery and the exposure lowered a bit.](http://i.imgur.com/8tPrL.jpg). 

How would you go about getting detail into that spot on his head? I was thinking of blending the recovered original with the edited photo, etc) . Any ideas of the steps I should take? 

I can upload a raw if that helps

Thanks!

I'm looking into getting my wedding photos edited by a professional and it looks like all the services online are more for photographers. I guess that would be because most people ended up with a professional photographer.

Quick back story: My husband and I has a tiny destination wedding in Iceland in April with 5 of our friends there, always have snow tires on!), oh and my husband fell over and cut his hands up, and almost fainted.

We were lucky that we got there safely and the priest arrived! It turned out it was the worst snow storm they had in years.

We had two friends who like to take pictures so they were on photo duty. But, (Which is fine because we didn't pay her, and she is doing it in exchange for me baking her 3 tier wedding cake in October) but when I look at other peoples photos I get a little sad. Almost to the point of wanting to go back and do a re-shoot with the professional.

Looking for any tips anyone has on colour correcting colour negs that are pretty much raw from the scanner. 

I have inverted them but apart from that they are untouched. 

So far from my attempts I can't seem to get the skin tones to look natural and there is always a little to much of a colour cast in different areas of the photo. 

Is there are proper method or do I have to do it all by eye. 

So far my process has been to bring the negs into PS and apply a general levels preset that I have created. Then I check the RGB values for a the closest colour to neutral grey I can find and adjust the levels based on what colour it needs more/less of. 

After that it's exposure with brightness and contrast

The photos are actually worth keeping too - I did 9 months of rock climbing

Now, so our photos are pretty much all 10 megapixel jpegs.

I want to retouch a selection of the photos (~100 or so) to make a book out of them to remember my holiday by.  I have attempted to retouch a few of the photos myself and even printed one or two of them out however it was a very time consuming process and I didn't really know what I was doing.

I don't mind spending a bit of time on this

What is the best way to go about creating a book, then a caption for each photo?  I have CS Collection 5 but don't know how to use it.

When I have printed out photos

Are there a few simply ways processes which basically help any photo?   

Most importantly

Is there an easy option?  Are their services online where you send them a bunch of photos and they send you the fixed up ones back.

I have a Dell Studio 15 laptop with a W-LED screen. I calibrated the screen some time ago with a Spyder 3 Express. That calibrated color profile is correctly loaded. I shot the picture with a D300, etc. in Photoshop CS5. I am quite pleased with the result, but now I doubt if my screen will give an accurate result for the print. When I turn the Spyder 3 calibrated profile off, the image looks very cold/bland. I don't have the hardware here anymore, so can't recalibrate, and I cannot make a test print. So I ask you to check the image on your own screen and judge the colors, tint, etc. **Does the image look good on your screen?** . Secondary question; are the girl's eyes the correct shade of brown?
