Rotterdam is also known for it's history in WWII. The city was bombed to bits leaving nearly all of the city centre ravaged. After the war came the 'Wederopbouw' (rebuilding) of Rotterdam

A few other interesting things about Rotterdam:

- Together with Frankfurt it is the only European city that can be considered a highrise city. Although the highest building is only 165m

- Rotterdam has a reputation of hosting great festivals. Currently the International Film Festival Rotterdam is being held. It has a reputation quite like the Sundance filmfestival

- Rotterdam is a city in which the majority of people is of foreign descent. This makes it very much a multi cultural city, Surinamese, Chinese, Cape Verdian and many other immigrants.

1259373643.0,a8ug7,"ILiveIn Project! Let's get people representing every continent and ask them cultural questions, world news opinions and compare them. We could learn a lot from the contrast!",IceX,22,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/ILiveIn/comments/a8ug7/ilivein_project_lets_get_people_representing/, is particularly bizarre or has appeared on a recent news piece. 

Most of the time when someone says ""I live in SomeWhere, I live there too! nice!"" and honestly sometimes is hard to find a relevant question regarding the location (whileas IAmA lacks that issue by being always able to ask ""what kind of cheese do you like the most"").

By getting a few people altogether, can generate better answers, debate and laughs in general.

So, and once we have a few, we pick the best and the people willing to answer can start a new self post with the answers to those questions and allow people to follow up on them.

**EDIT**

Up to now we have:

danilosaur/cartola: Brazil

TheLeaderIsGood: England/Ireland

fangus: Scotland

olihahe: Iceland

thecapitalc: Canada

odddrums: Norcal/Hollywood

fleg: Poland

IceX: Argentina

random_pattern: Bushwick

BritishEnglishPolice: UK

And many more that will pop up.
That is more than great! We even have an UK trifecta
I'd love to see someone from Africa, and of course someone from Oceania, so we would have a lot of diversity. Later today I'll think of an initial block of questions, and invite everyone to participate!

I hope you like the idea


**EDIT 2** 

Ok, with youtube videos, songs, links and all!). I'll now create a new ILiveIn post with the questions cartola and I have been thinking about. Feel free to add your own or tweak/criticize (in a respectful manner) the existing questions. Once we have a solid set of the best questions there, we can move to step 3 of a comparative answering of the questions and enlightenment will ensue!


Oh, I don't want you to think this is my idea and I'm running the show and calling the shots. Please Feel free to criticize, suggest ways to improve all this, or even say ""Hey, I'd do a better job than you organizing this stuff!""

For some background information regarding how I ended up on this odd little island let me tell you a bit about myself. I've been constantly moving all of my life due to my fathers job and when I was living in Georgia he got a job offer to work here in Jamaica for the company he worked for. He accepted that offer and four months later we were here in Kingston. I'm actually moving back to the states in eight days sadly

I was also here during the assault on Tivoli Gardens to capture Dudus Coke. Here is a news article from CNN if anyone is interested on the turbulent event for the country. [Link](http://articles.cnn.com/2010-05-24/world/jamaica.violence_1_security-forces-tivoli-gardens-drug-lord?_s=PM:WORLD)

All you have to do is include your ""country code"" at the beginning of your post title (self-posts only).

There are some potential issues I can think of using the flags: 
 
* People might just not want to use them so it would be a waste of time to set up.  
* Since most users only make one post in /r/IliveIn they might not bother figuring out how to get the flag to show up.  
* The fact that you have to add your ""country code"" at the beginning of every post might clutter up how /r/ILiveIn looks.  
* Not every user has custom styles enabled.
