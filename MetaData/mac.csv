1361209218.0,18re5z,Run Windows 8 off USB on your Mac,phiber232,80,8,19,"I just got Windows 8 to go working on my mid 2012 Mac Book Air. Like many people with this laptop I have a puny 128GB SSD and don't want to waste space for Windows when I only need it from time to time. It's not easy but with a little time you can install Windows 8 to USB and run it from your flash drive instead of your main harddrive. The speed is not bad. My Mac doesn't have usb 3.0 so the speed is limited by 2.0 but its definitely usable and I was playing world of warcraft on windows 8 with minor slow downs.



**What You'll Need**

1) A usb drive. The faster the better. It will fit on 16GB but 32GB will give you more space to install applications. An external hard drive will also work. Some flash manufacturers sell certified Windows to go flash drives for a premium. They are not necessary but do make it easier.

2) Windows 8 disk or iso

3) Windows 7 or 8 computer. I did it on a Windows 8 computer but I don't think Windows 7 would be a problem.



**Copy Boot Camp drivers to your build computer**

1) Format your usb drive as FAT

2) Start boot camp assistant and select ""download the latest windows support software from apple""

3) Use your newly formatted usb drive as the destination

4) Remove from MAC and stick in Windows build computer

5) Copy WindowsSupport directory to your windows build computer



**Preparing your USB drive**

All These instructions come from : http://www.rmprepusb.com/tutorials/win8togo


1) Download RMPrepUSB from here: http://www.rmprepusb.com/documents/release-2-0

2) Format your flash drive using the following options: 3. Win bootable (BOOTMGR)

3) Download Windows 8 Waik tools here: http://www.rmprepusb.com/tutorials/getwaiktools/GetWaikTools.zip?attredirects=0

4) Open a administrator command prompt and go to the new downloaded tools folder

5) Assuming your windows 8 source is at k: and your usb flash drive is at u

                ImageX.exe /apply k:\Sources\Install.wim 1 u:

6) That takes 20-60 minutes depending on speed then type:

               BCDBOOT u:\Windows /s u: /v

7) Slip the Boot camp drivers into the installation

               dism u:\ /add-driver /driver:*BootCamp Directory*\Drivers /recurse

8) Copy the WindowsSupport bootcamp directory to the new USB



**Starting Windows 8 to go**

1) Insert usb drive into Mac

2) Hold down the option key while the Mac is booting

3) Select the windows drive and hit enter

4) Wait



**After Windows is running**

If you're not using one of the designated certified windows to go drives then Windows doesn't work as expected in some cases. To trick Windows into thinking the flash drive is standard non-removable drive do the following:

1) Download the cfadisk usb filter driver here: http://www.fileden.com/files/2011/12/22/3242144/microdrive.7z

2) Open an administrator command prompt and type the following:

            bcdedit /set loadoptions DISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS
            bcdedit /set testsigning ON

3) Go to device manager and update the usb flash driver with the downloaded one

4) Reboot while holding down the option button

5) Go to windows explorer



**Completing the Boot Camp installation**

1) Go to your bootcamp directory and run setup.exe. That should get all your hardware recognized



Hopefully these instructions are somewhat clear.

but i must admit

I used to love my sony vaio. i work my laptops to the bone, my tech-savvy (geek) friends bore down on me to invest in a $1200 macbook, despite being pc-users for the most part. i paid $250 for the extended warranty just in case, and it was one of the best decisions i'd made as a professional student, 2nd only to buying a mac. this will become clear in a minute.
now this mac and me were like twins. i do EVERYTHING with it. Programming, and a myriad of other skills i thought would make my purchase worthwhile. i went through 2 screens (one paid for by apple, which NO manufacturer will do), cd drive, airport cards, keyboards, power chords. god damn
in the meantime, mind you) the last communication with toshiba went like this:
toshiba - ""because your computer was purchased in singapore
me - ""I'VE NEVER BEEN TO SINGAPORE!!!"" it was purchased in  indiana.""
toshiba - well
click

finally best buy piped in and said they would replace the computer because it had been repaired 3 times (cf. no lemon law). but they didn't make that model anymore

back to my butchered mac. i REALLY beat the hell out of that thing. my warranty expired on October 23
i sent it in

Apple - ""Mr. Anderson

(at this point i'm thinking, typical customer service i've experienced elsewhere. ""even Apple has a 'screw you' policy"" , i thought.
Apple - ""we are very sorry for the inconvenience""
me - ""here it comes..."" i thought.
Apple - we can offer to try to repair it again
me - okay
Apple - we would like to GIVE you a new macbook with the same specs. unfortunately we stopped making that model

1295665175.0,f6uv4,Performance Tips,turboboss,67,12,26,"Has your mac been running slowly lately? After nearly two years of daily use, 160GB

Hardware:

I replaced the 160GB

I upgraded the 2GB of 1066MHz DDR3 to 8GB ($102

I swapped the optical drive for another HDD. I got the optical bay to SATA converter on eBay for $15 and a 500GB Western Digital HDD on Amazon for $53.

Software:

I ran a fresh install of Snow Leopard on the SSD using the DVD

I used the magic of Mac OS X's Symlink feature. A symlink is like a shortcut/alias except the system doesn't see it as a file; it treats a symlink as if it were the folder if was linking to. Creating a symlink for your documents

Having 8GBs of RAM is overkill for most applications

The speed boost comes when you copy your computer's most-requested files to the RamDisk and fool it into thinking they are on the boot drive. Again, copy that to your RamDisk, delete the original folder and create a symlink that points to the RamDisk. The result? Everything is much much faster. Simple, everyday tasks such as web browsing, managing folders, etc become instant. I have even noticed a difference in entering text.

I also moved Google Chrome, just the database) to the RamDisk. The result is around 600MB less of usable RAM, but extreme improvements in everyday computing tasks.

Then, it killed off all those annoying transitions that are cool to watch the first time, but kill productivity.

Finally, I checked the 'quick increase' box. This changes some settings and optimizes your internet connection for high-speed service (no, I'm not sure exactly what it does. Something to do with time-out values). It resulted in a very noticeable acceleration in page load time.

For $290

Yes, for everyday tasks such as web browsing, it is many times faster.

Note: Some of the procedures I outlined here are probably risky, you should probably not attempt this. But if you are, have fun!

Symlink Instructions:
The best way (that I know of) to efficiently create a working symbolic link is by using the terminal.
Here is a list of what each of these four commands do:

1. Copy all files in your 'documents' folder into a new 'Documents' folder onto Macintosh Data HD (note
2. Modify the old Documents folder to allow it to be removed (usually Mac OS X prohibits this)
3. Remove the old Documents folder
4. Create a symbolic link where the old Documents folder used to be

cp -Rp ~/Documents /Volumes/Macintosh*Data*HD

chmod -R -N ~/Documents

rm -rf ~/Documents

ln -s /Volumes/Macintosh*Data*HD/Documents ~/Documents

The same procedure can be used to move the user cache to your ramdisk,,False,self,t5_2qh4u,True,,True

Yes

Not that new announcements always have to be about grand gestures.  There's more than a few little things we've been looking forward to Apple fixing for some time too—like the pop-up error message you get if you remove a USB device without ejecting it properly—which even Windows stopped doing years ago—and the lack of a fully integrated backup and restore application that doesn't require the user to manually fetch and carry every Preference Pane and Library folder from a Time Machine archive.  Or the way Finder will stop an operation if just one of the files you want to move or copy from one volume to another is currently open—even if this is a false positive.  Disk Utility still doesn't fix file permissions properly unless you run it from the OS X installer disc.  The wish list is almost endless.

Then there's customisation.  I've been a Mac user for nearly 20 years and I still have no idea how to use Automator.  I know it should be drag and drop simple and I know people who understand AppleScript already say it is, before finding out that Automator doesn't fully support TextEdit scripting and has a strange bug which records every mouse movement in ultra-slow motion which can only be stopped by forcing the entire machine to restart.

I suppose what we long-time Mac users ultimately wished for from OS X Lion, no customisation, retrogressive changes to fullscreen controls, a lack of professional level import / export capabilities, and so on.

I'm sure when it eventually arrives

It would have been nice to finally bury at least one of these myths

Apparently a slug crawled inside the back left-hand vent (underneath the screen hinge) and committed a violent act of martyrdom all over my nearly-new machine.

He said I could take it to a non-Apple store if I wanted to, but that was the end of it as far as they were concerned. It's also not covered by my personal insurance.

* Beg for an exception to be made. Is this possible? Would they listen to my pitiful tale? 
* Try to get it fixed by someone not connected to Apple. This is a possibility

* So, it will show you the location of the item without having to go to Finder. This was the main reason I used to use the open in Finder feature anyway!

* Did you know you can Get Info on an item in the search list by highlighting it and pressing Command+I? Not all system shortcuts work - Command+C doesn't copy the item

* You can drag an item from the search list directly into an application (e.g. to add a mail attachment

* If you drag an item from the search list onto your Desktop, and you will make a copy instead.

* Dragging an item from the search list into a File-&gt;Open dialog box *doesn't* automatically select the file's location for you (like it would if you dragged an item from a Finder window). Instead it seems to copy the item into the folder that is currently selected in the dialog box. Weird.

* You can perform a Spotlight search *while you are dragging items*. Let's say you have 3 images you want to open in Photoshop, press Command+Space, type your search to bring up Photoshop, hit Enter. The app will open, and you can now drop your files into the Dock icon. (I use this for quickly creating zip files with the 3rd-party archiver Keka).

Here is my checklist (Plus other unmentioned stuff I have mentally retained):

* ~~A Name~~
* ~~Plan for a native user interface~~
* ~~An open source licensing plan~~
* ~~JSON Querying~~
* ~~Authentication into Reddit~~
* Basic Functionality: Reading posts and comments
* Advanced functionality: Upvote, comments
* Icons for subreddits
* Native page navigation: NSPageController with two finger swiping

As a community, criticisms, questions, programming assistance, graphical assistance; anything. You can fork it on Github and help out too.

Well, the scholarship committee 'decided' to throw in a 2011 Macbook Air. The scholarship itself was a more than welcome surprise, but the additional Mac topped it off.

After the excitement of the surprise died down

My initial experience(s) with the Mac have been great. OSX Lion is phenomenal - the intuitiveness of its design as well as the user-friendliness has made learning it a breeze. Additionally, as I find them both to be wonderful. Also, my experience with installing Windows on it was easier than I could have imagined - Boot Camp allowed me to instantly mount my Windows Iso onto a flash drive and boot right from there. It also supplied me with all of the necessary fixes that made the Mac much more compatible/usable with Windows.

TL;DR: I, I can honestly say that the OS and the build quality are top notch and I now understand why so many people love them. I am now a happy Mac/PC hybrid user, and love both for their respective qualities.

For this example

1. Open Terminal (Apps/Utilities/Terminal).
2. Figure out the actual process name of your program. For me, instead it was 'webide'.
3. In the terminal, like webide.
4. With your name, example 'sudo opensnoop -n webide'. 
5. Open the program. When the app gets to the license denial screen
6. Examine the files accessed when the program was launched. Check the ones loaded just before you stopped it. I saw a few of interest:

'/var/folders/5g/5g5enqVqELOpC63u3oBrFk+++TI/-Caches-//mds/mdsDirectory.db ' - In the var folder with 'caches' in the path. Probably something temporary and perhaps related to licenses. Delete this folder with the command (be careful with this one): 'rm -r -f /var/folders/5g/'. 

The most obvious of these is the one containing 'eval.key'
'/Users/username/Library/Preferences/WebIde50/eval/PhpStorm5.evaluation.key' among a few others. Delete this folder (the library/prefs/webide50 folder). 

Do this for any files that appear temporary

List of (free) apps needed:

* AppCleaner - http://www.freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/
* CCleaner - http://www.piriform.com/mac/ccleaner
* OnyX - http://www.titanium.free.fr/downloadonyx.php
* Disk Utility - In-built

Pre-1 - **Make a backup**. I'm not responsible for any screw-up. Nor will I help you fix it. Boo-hoo. I also won't explain anything further

1 - Start by running CCleaner

2 - Run OnyX, in ""Permissions"", check ""Reset home directory and ACLs"" and execute. In Scripts, check all the boxes and execute. On ""Rebuild"", leave everything default and execute it.

3 - **THIS ONE IS OPTIONAL**

Follow what is described [here](http://james.brooks.so/blog/fixing-slow-osx-startup/)
&gt; * Restart your Mac
&gt;* Run *fsck -y* to check the boot volume’s file system
&gt; * Next run *mount -uw /* which mounts the boot volume
&gt;* To fix the ACLs run *chmod -R -N /Volumes*
&gt;* Type reboot


4 -  Reboot into your recovery partition. Run Disk Utility. Verify (and if needed repair permissions) and Verify (and if needed repair) your main HD (usually ""Macintosh HD"").

5 -  Reset your [SMC](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964) and [PRAM](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1379)

That's it! This should speed things up (it did for me).

I recently purchased the new 27in iMac and I opted to get 8gb of RAM and purchase the upgrade from an external site.

My question:

would there be a downside to upgrading the RAM with 2 8 GB sticks for a total of 24? This would equal 2 x 4gb RAM sticks and 2 x 8gb RAM  sticks.

Here's what I think.

For home use I'll probably never go back. If I had to sum up the quite frankly beautiful operating system in one word it would be *""quiet""*. There's no extraneous noise

But here also are my gripes.

You can't really operate OS X using *just* the keyboard. Stay with me here. I'm writing this on a little Asus eeePC running Windows XP, maximise it to, alt+tab of course, all of the /alt + *a* + *a* combinations, add in the windows key combinations. CUT AND PASTE using keyboard only (I'm talking files here). Paste a file or folder with same name and Windows will handle it, elegently. F2 to rename a file, This I miss from OS X. You just learn this stuff over 15 years and the keyboard is like *heaps* faster than the mouse. heaps (weird choice of vernacular there).

If I could just hit the Alt key, since forever, OS X would not just be better, but perfect. Also I'd like to be able to resize windows from *any* edge, but I hear this is (finally) coming in Lion. Fuck, that seems like a major oversight for a long time.

OK, they are at an angle to each other. Perhaps 120 degrees. Windows/PC is work (and it really is), and Mac is play. For example Windows will maybe never have any connection to something like the B &amp; W Zeppelin Air playing Groove Salad (Soma FM App) over AirPlay, like I'm listening to right now. This is typical Mac sexiness (btw airplay don't sound as good as when the iPod is connected, damn it) 
...But Windows has hot keys.

I got a Macbook Pro back in April for the usual reasons, so our collection has grown exponentially since 2011. One thing we definitely wanted to do was make DVD's that we could send to parents and grandparents. I consider myself computer-savvy, but not creative or patient enough to spend hours editing transitions and music cues, etc.

Immediately, I need to import every photo or video I need to use into iMovie, which slows things down and wastes space. Once imported, it is hard to find, since videos are organized into events, and I don't know how to add my entire back catalog of media. There doesn't seem to be an easy to way add a video to a project in one click.

So:

1) Do I really need to import every single media file into iMovie to use it?

2) Is there a simpler way to create movies in iMovie (or another software) without all the tools I will never need or understand?

Safari isn't terrible. It's somewhat fast, it's also addon-retarded and not quite as fast as some of its competitors.

After quickly glancing through their site I figured I'd order another case for my 13"" MBP. I like the aluminum look of the MBP, the case and what it looked like after being applied.

[Album!](http://imgur.com/a/OxhNZ#0)

As you can see, but the speck was removed in less than a minute. Double edged sword, but I feel like this is a plus since with the speck I sometimes felt myself wondering if I ever did accidentally knock my computer down if the case would just pop off. Not the case at all here.

I ordered the case with standard shipping at 2:30am on Monday the 13th. It was delivered before noon today, though still nowhere near as slick as other ""hard cases"". It grips tables and clothing (on my lap) comfortably instead of sliding everywhere like a normal hard case.

    while [ 1 ];do vardate=$(date +%d\-%m\-%Y\_%H.%M.%S); screencapture -t jpg -x ~/Desktop/ScreenRecord/$vardate.jpg; sleep 1; done

Every 1 second (or whatever value you set after the 'sleep' command) a screenshot of your main screen will be placed in the ScreenRecord folder on your desktop.

When you've captured all the images you want

Now open Quicktime Player 7 (regular Quicktime Player that ships with Snow Leopard onwards is feature crippled but you can still download version 7 from Apple.com).

In the file menu choose 'Open image sequence'.  Choose the first image in the folder and click OK.  Then choose the frame rate.

You can now Save As or Export your video into whatever format your currently installed Codecs will allow.  Badda bing!

I've been living with it until now and just decided to see if there's anything I can do. All you're gonna need is a little piece of electrical tape. 

Cut about a 1"" segment of electrical tape and cut it into a shape like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ric6plr.jpg). The coin is the same size as the US quarter. 

Insert the tape into the headphone jack like [this](http://i.imgur.com/cHaurRu.jpg). Make sure the skinny part of the tape goes on the bottom side of the headphone jack. Also make sure only about half of the skinny section of the tape actually goes inside the jack so it doesn't cover the metal on the inside. The pictures should be self explanatory.

Hope this helps!

Just cross-posting a comment I made earlier on the Dota2 board about how I repaired my 2011 MBP.  Went from 800mHz @ 75-80C idle and &gt;100C load (causing crashes/shutdown) to 56-60C idle and 80-85C 100%load (2.5gHz with boost)

This thing is finally running like the product I had intended on owning YEARS back when I purchased it.  If you're having similar issues, overheating, etc... I would be willing to bet you have the same issue and can fix it just as cheaply as I did.  I know the problem has been known about for many years (and denied by PLENTY of apple employees lololol) but it's there.  It looked like someone built a fortress of thermal paste in a wall AROUND my chip and the ship itself had practically nothing on it.  Pathetic.  Anyways, $30 for tools, canned air, and good paste, and now it feels like I own a brand new machine.  

Props to the guys I quoted from macrumors and youtube
_______________________________________________
Those models have a manufacturing defect.  The factory over-applied thermal paste to the CPU/GPU, my CPU was clocking down to 800mHz, and heating up over 95C until the sensors kicked in and shutdown the system (to avoid heat damage).


Apple doesn't recognize this as a recall or manufacturing issue (typical apple nonsense), replace if necessary, re-apply thermal paste, etc)

I am of the mentality that the ""geniuses"" are just googlers with a knack for working on computers, I already had everything else) and thermal paste, and did the tear-down and re-application this weekend and have seen an improvement that I didn't think was possible.  I'm idling at ~55C, with 20% fan speed (cant even hear them), and under load, my 2.2 i7 is boosting up around 2.6gHz, and with max fan speed keeping itself around 85-88C (which is perfect temp for these chips).

I used Antec Formula 7 thermal compound and it worked flawlessly.  

Here's a [walkthrough](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1105643) on a forum that shows you the problem and what to expect.  Here's a [youtube walkthrough](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlMxoHK0Os4) of the same process.  The pictures you see in that forum post were MUCH better than what I found in mine.  It looked like they had put a dollop of thermal paste the size of a wasabi serving at a sushi restaurant and just squashed it with the heatsink.  

I have never seen this computer run so perfectly.  I've had it since it was new, but it's not out of reach for anyone who's done similar work.  Feel free to PM me with any issues, questions, etc and I'd be more than happy to help.  (Because we all know apple won't)",,False,self,1365869796.0,t3_1c9i9h

But rather than being patient when it came to dragging and dropping the whole mess back onto iPhoto

After having no choice but to force the computer to restart

So I did something I've never done before but was surprised to find how easy it was

If Finder gets stuck on something that won't allow you to boot normally—or boot for long enough to fix something that prevents normal operation—boot from the OS X installer CDROM and choose Terminal from the Utilities menu.

Even though you can't see any of your hard drives on the desktop (because the installer CDROM doesn't launch Finder) you can still mount and unmount your connected hard drives from inside Disk Utilities and Terminal.

In Terminal type:

    cd /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD
    
to navigate to the folder or folders you think are causing the issue.  In my case it was the Desktop folder in my user directory.  Once there I used the UNIX command mv to move all image files to another folder

    mkdir /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/JPEGMoved
    mv *.jpg /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/JPEGMoved
    mkdir /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/RawMoved
    mv *.crw /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/RawMoved

You can then reboot as normal and everything inadvertently moved to the Desktop will have been moved into a folder inside your main Macintosh HD

Modern battery technology (general and not specific to Macs) has a ""recharge count, and then goes upstairs to plug it in, you're essentially wasting a charge. He has also said that there is a ""trickle charge"" feature, which does not use one of the finite charges -- but that is only used when you're already at, say, 95% (not sure of real number).

I ve been seriously considering buying my next machine and I m really confused which way to go. Basically I'm a developer doing loads of coding... so I'm really after good performance. This is what I've narrowed down to 

-MBA | 1.7GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7 | Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz | 8GB 1600MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM | 256GB Flash Storage

-MBP | 2.9GHz Dual-core Intel Core i7 | Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz | 8GB 1600MHz DDR3 SDRAM — 2x4GB | 750GB Serial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpm | SuperDrive 8x (DVD±R DL/DVD±RW/CD-RW)


- Is the MBA developer friendly? 
- Does Retina Display make a huge world of difference? 
- SSD performance v normal HDD?

1368244861.0,1e41xh,A sad and desperate request for help,madhatr,21,5,14,"Sadly my 46 year old brother passed away on the 19th of last month. Being the ""computer guy"" of the family I have had to job of closing down accounts and getting all of his online affairs in order. Most of the information is on his 2008 Macbook Pro running 10.8.3. He also has a iPad 2

Now I believe I need access to his keychain for accessing his email account to start closing accounts and such. The only options I am given is to make a new keychain that will delete it and make a new keychain

I found some program that could find out what the user password is

Can someone please help. I am at my wits end. Is there anyway to un-reset his login password or any other way that I can get in there. Any help would be great.

[Update 1]: Oh yea

[Update 2]: I called Applecare because the battery in it was also swollen and popped out of the lower cover. The person on the phone told me to go to Keychain and reset it. Not sure if this will fix it of not but the woman on the phone said they will replace the battery for me and she was so very kind.

1364844567.0,1bg0n4,MacBook Pro R printing problems,rcns,20,4,6,"Hi. I have a MBPr and I am having an issue printing.

I am running 10.8.3 and have a Cannon MFC8380 laser printer. On a regular basis when attempting to print

I have had the same results regardless of weather I setup the printer via USB (MacBook directly) or try to access via ethernet (wired from router

On various occasions I have removed the printing system (holding option while selecting the ""-"" on Print &amp; Scan in System Prefs) and added the printer again. Some of the times this has worked for awhile but within a few print jobs I am back to the job stalling in the queue and the RESUME button becoming available but with no success.

So this problem is intermittent. But mostly a situation with no printing.

I also have a MacMini (current generation) which has no problem printing the same jobs to the same printer via ethernet. While illogical

My last thought was to reinstall OS X on the MacBook Pro R from the restore system on the SSD (holding Command R while restarting). This will provide me with an option to reinstall the system software but when I go any further I am told that my installed OS (the active 10.8.3) is newer than the restore files so I cannot proceed.

Based on the fact that the printer works fine from the Mini running the same version of the 10.8.3 I am assuming I have a software issue on the MacBook Pro R but I can't reinstall my 10.8.3 from restore.

Hope I didn't leave out any information. Any ideas where I go from here?

I've pretty much tried everything up to reformatting, which I'm hesitant to try since I just did that a year back and I don't really want to go through the hassle if I'm not sure it's even going to touch my problem.

Frequent Google searches have told me this isn't an isolated problem. Hundreds of threads pop up when I search for this issue

1376332069.0,1k806w,iTunes replacement for better enjoyment/management of large music library,SeasonFinale,29,13,8,"**WANTED**: iTunes replacement for better enjoyment/management of large music library

**BACKGROUND**

I have a large library of well tagged ALAC (lossless) music ripped from thousands of CDs.

I took the plunge from Sonos into iTunes and Apple a few years ago because iTunes was stable, Remote, and Home Sharing seemed appealing.  I wanted to have everything under one umbrella, but with Sonos for example I couldn't rate a song I was listening to because playing was separate from library management.

But all this Apple music stuff is a joke -- features checked off a list that don't really work in the real world.  Home Sharing loses 90% of my collection all the time forcing me to deactivate and reactivate it (of course having to type my password in again every time).  Remote never provides UI feedback so I end up tapping

And even the basic desktop iTunes app, and in the latest version they eliminated the ability to even have more than 1 window open at once which makes building playlists very difficult.  I could go on...

But bitter rambling aside

Some features on my wishlist:
 - browsing by album art
 - support for multiple genre tags
 - support for multiple artist tags
 - good playlist management
 - import/export data (including playlists) from/to iTunes

And ideally it would work with AirPlay and Remote (since I have those set up already)

If nothing exists

I've recently got my hands on an old G4 Cube running OS 9.2.2 and have been trying to come up with some fun uses for it. To start, Sega Genesis, or really whatever I can find that works. Problem is, it's not really easy to find older versions of these emulators that will run on this version of OS.

I'd prefer to keep the original OS as a sort of fun piece of history if I can, does anyone have any idea where I can find such old software? (Keep in mind .dmg files are not supported in this old system.)

(Using MacBook6

After following many tutorials and attempting to fix the contents of BootCamp to allow my mac to create a USB boot disk to run windows
The fix was meant to add an option to BootCamp to create the disk for you

1) Right click ""open package contents"" Applications&gt;Utilities&gt;Boot Camp Assistant.

2) Create a duplicate of info.plist and save to desktop. Rename original as infoOLD.plist.

3) Open info.plist with a text editor. Locate the sections where the model identifiers are listed (I had three). Open ""About This Mac""

4) For my system the content of &lt;strings&gt;&lt;/strings&gt; are written using the model identifier found in the system report. Other tutorials listed the content as the first 4 symbols of the Boot Rom Version (i.e. MB61 for MacBook6,1&lt;/string&gt; if the others are in that style or &lt;string&gt;MB61&lt;/string&gt; alternatively).

5) My info.plist had a section called PreUSBSupportedModels, and along with the other additions you make, save to the Package folder, then reload BootCamp Assistant. Then follow Boot Camps instructions.
