**The BackStory**
Growing up with the original and being young I learned to see past the dated graphics that many stopped at and experienced the depth of the game's plots
With growing Maturity growing up and Several replays later I was enjoying each play though as a new experience!
One day I got linked to that tiny teaser for DX3 this sparked my constant hunting for any and all news related to it. the following years of development for the game exposed me to its amazing art decor and design which ultimately must of caused this desire to live and breath in a space that directly inspires me of such a world.
So to the part that's most interesting. the finished product.
I'm currently sat in the room now typing this away being able to appreciate its company meaning i could post pictures now!
However Being quite the showman! ( And dead proud how well it looks!) I'm going to wait for one more component to arrive (Keyboard)to be 100% finished then I'll Create the DSLR album! (both night and day
Hope you Guys Enjoy the Room as much as I had watching it being built!

**TLDR: Room Album will be up tomorrow! I'm won over by it! hopefully you are too!**

1365479585.0,1byvet,why I chose the Sarif Ending (major spoilers),ChromeGhost,51,5,20,"So at the end of the game I was presented with the option of Telling people the truth as Darrow suggested

Now all these options have their flaws but I will explain my reasoning.  I would have been tempted to choose to destroy panchea but I didnt want to kill the innocent people I spent the whole level trying to save and protect(and that poor LIMB clinic girl!).  It would also leave people grieving for their lost love ones and leave them without answers.  I felt the was a cop out so I didn/t go with it

So that leaves Hugh, but despite his flaws he was the only one who was honest about fighting for what he believed in.  Taggart and Hugh played games and switched their stories too often.  I felt their outlook was too negative for my taste, while Sarif was the only one who tried to be consistently optimistic.   Not only that, but I felt they were a bit callous about the innocent people they were affecting. For example, taggart calls the innocent victims in panchea ""augmented monsters"". while Sarif's first concern was about the wounded.  It is also revealed that Hugh was bitter about being one of the rare few who's genetics would reject augmentation.  I felt this made his ""truth"" too biased, and would set technology and progress backwards.  And while someone may bring up that Sarif was funded by the DOD, I feel that this was a necessity in order for the greater good to be achieved.  If it wasn't Sarif it would be some other company.  Finally, you would see that he has turned down DeBeers many times for ethical reasons.  I got the sense that he really wanted what was best for the world

Now lets talk about society in the grand scheme.  Its in our nature to evolve.  People get so hung up about their fears of people turning themselves into weapons that they fail to see one of the biggest benefits to augmentations.  Neural augs.  Imagine the progress that would be made possible if everyone could be neural augmented.  It would really help doctors, one of the biggest barriers to augmentation would be removed; neuropozine.  Having to pay for anti rejection drugs would keep augmentation out of reach for the poor.  Even if they could save money and get augmented, they would have struggle to pay for a lifetime of drugs.  But Megan's research would change that.

So that was the rationale behind my decision.",,t5_2r0qr,1365491511.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/1byvet/why_i_chose_the_sarif_ending_major_spoilers/

Anyway, nice of them to answer some questions. 

Here's what JFD said about the dialogues ([source](http://forums.eidosgames.com/showpost.php?p=1929326&amp;postcount=42)):

Just to set the record straight - When we say it took us 6 months

There were many things to take into consideration. We need to figure out a lot of aspects:

1. Who is this character and what is the conflict with him? (why Jensen cares and vice versa). It was easier with characters such as Haas because we were able to build a background story about him and Jensen. However, there are a lot of brainstorms about finding the ""thing"" that will make the social fight work.

2. Once it's figured out, the NPC reacts than counter attack. His counter attack is picked from a pool randomly for each round of the social battle. Thus, it makes each encounter playable more than once. What all that means? We had to write about 20 mins of dialog for each social battles even though they last less than 5 mins when you play them. Making all the possible connections blend naturally in each other was quite a challenge.

3. We build the system in Excel (playable version) and send it to most of the Eidos Montreal studio. People play it and send us back their Excel sheet with their track record and their additional feedback. It allows us to see what works and what doesn't. We can go through several iterations (or not) depending on the feedback we receive.

4. Once we're pretty comfortable with the results, the movement, etc. So, now it's time to brainstorm on this and figure out the drama. Then we draw a top-down view of the basic layout of the room and we add the choreography on top of it. We do it in 3D - we take the measurements, etc.

5. Now

6. then we have to put it in the engine, added, etc.

In the glorious yearr of Deus Ex's release I was in middle school. I started playing DXSP and due to hardware problems I always GPFed when trying to transfer to Tonnochi_Road from the Canals. I tried going through that little 128x128 hallway so many times in a desperate hope that I may make it through *once*. My god

**best Christmas ever.**

Fastforward a bit and I started playing DXMP. I ran into this guy named... *sigh* Playerbigdick and for some reason started joining servers with the guy regularly and we would always be on the same team (usually NSF).* I ran through the hood by the name of ""FBI"" around this time and yes... that was ""Female Body Inspector."" But anyway, who is uh... ""Edwin"" from here on out introduced me to the Unreal Editor and I took to it like crazy.

 Here

I want to formally appologize for him and his maps such as... ""Jazz's_Torture_Castle_v1"" v2, but come on...

Anyway

Sometime during all this I started working on TNM. Some of my worst and best mapping was done in this mod and I'm happy I was a part of it. Just another chapter in my fond memories of this game and how it had an effect on me. Trestkon

I'm always gonna wonder what happened to Edwin and the other guys from [NSF]. I know that Edwin went by another name ""Gheist"" on DeusExEditing and created that Tactical mod that I still see on servers from time to time to this day. If any of you goof balls are here give me a shout. Also

*: You have no idea how many times I rewrote this sentence.

I decided to put myself through this for a number of reasons.

First and foremost, partially because of the high level of freedom the player is given in achieving objectives.

The other reason is that there are things people seem to take for granted about this game; like that the boss fights are almost impossible without the Typhoon

1317363911.0,kw7h0,The consensus was right...,Boarder22345,35,3,16,"Brief history: 

I gave Deus Ex multiple shots. I loaded up the character

I come across my first enemy: try to shoot him with a pistol...miss. I keep firing waiting for him to drop. A bullet to the head finally lands and he's dead. My leg completely immobile from the enemy fire.

But wait a second

The enemy acted completely retarded. First, stops. After his line dance he resumes firing at me.

What the hell

I press on to encounter more of these NPC's

After about an hour of playing

'It's Outdated

So

But I was severely short sighted. This game is one of a kind. It took me 2 years of ignoring

My latest play through I loaded up my character. I picked skills that I knew would come in handy from the times before that I played and was on my way.

The moment I knew it was an experience to cherish is when I broke into the Statue of Liberty building and

The choice

I've been hooked ever since. This is my 4th play through and I'm gearing up for the fifth afterwords.

I wrote this because I feel there are a lot of players who want to appreciate the consensus

So to those gamers who want to appreciate what eventually will be considered one of the greatest pieces of gaming all I can say is: keep trying to play it

Slowly ease your way into familiarity with its controls, etc. until you feel confident and you find that ""moment."" You'll find an incredibly complex, remarkable experience to be had.

Think about it, but due to limited resources it's hard to find a good opportunity.

If you're like me

And why are resources in the game so limited? Two words- candy bars. Fuck Neuropozyne

Despite the game's limited resources, we all make mistakes. It's not like the game wants you to *starve*. Sometimes you just don't have a candy bar on-hand and you need a little hand-out, or a bail-out if you will, to keep yourself afloat. But as a result *you never eat any of the super-rare candy bars and you subsist the entire game on ~~government~~ energy handouts.* But the ~~welfare check~~ extra energy bar doesn't always come exactly when you need it and you have to ~~kill your kids~~ wait next to the guard for a few seconds before you can melee him.

Near the end of the game, ""an opportunity to use all these resources I've accumulated."" Unfortunately, what awaits him is nothing more than a bunch of pseudo-zombies and a lackluster boss fight- both of which present very few opportunities to actually utilize his massive accumulation of resources. The end, for Adam, is the same as the end for all of us- no matter how cool your robot arms, how retractable your sunglasses, or how 1337 your h4x,,True,t3_kojbo

This is something that has been bothering me for a while. Throughout the game, and unopposed augmentation.

Each choice was supposed to have a 'bad' aspect to it - but I never saw an issue with allowing Sarif to have full and free control over augs. He genuinely seemed to be a force for good, getting Adam augmented without consent, and likely a few other things too).

I felt though, Sarif was a much, much morally worthy character, and so to pursue his objectives is not as difficult as the others to justify. 

On the one hand, etc) but the others - such as Taggart, were actively involved in things involving the Tyrants, with full knowledge of the consequences. 

I find that Sarif could have easily been given a darker, activated by Pritchard would be much better, in terms of questionable morality).

I am wondering what you guys think. I've thought about this for a while, while a bit too Utilitarian, hasn't really committed anything anywhere near the level of Darrow or Taggart, and therefore 'his' ending, in which biotech corporations are free to do whatever they want (Which face it, will basically be SI, as the driving force behind Tai-Yong is dead).",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/1aipey/why_i_believe_the_best_ending_is_the_sarif_ending/

An interesting reply about The Fall from moderator Jerion:

&gt;Deus Ex: The Fall is a tangent game. It is not the future of the core of the series. It is designed to bring the core of Human Revolution's gameplay and an expansion of the universe lore to the iPad while providing an additional avenue to expose new fans to the series- and it does this with surprisingly strong execution. What it is not is a sequel to Human Revolution; That game has yet to make an appearance. No, it doesn't impact things in a substantial way. Between the controls being simplified a bit for the touch interface and the level design taking this into account, it is a considered removal. There is a vaulting button which allows for jump-like behavior where contextually reasonable.",,False,,t5_2r0qr,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/1gerjx/eidos_forum_moderators_answer_questions_about_the/

The long

You may be wondering why I bring this up in the DE forums...  

I think they put a LOT of the spirit of Deus Ex into Black Mesa.  It's wonderful!  They added so much more depth

Here's an example of what reminds me of DE about Black Mesa:

Early in the Black Mesa mod, I was wrong, you could have followers in the original game).  At this point, you do not have a weapon yet (in the original game, you'd just run for your life or whack the shit out of them with your crowbar).  I thought, ""wow, that's pretty cool... let's do this!""  

My new BFF proceeded to back me up like a madman

**Repawn** So I'm trying to protect my bodyguard a little better this time.  We're doing great, feeling strong.  The hallway in front of us looks clear.  Right as that happy thought crosses my mind, a flaming headcrabbie comes up behind my buddy, flattening him instantly.  I cannot believe the horror I have just witnessed - again.  In frustration, knowing I am going to die, I rush at them.  The demon (pretty sure that was Shirley from cybernetics) and my buddy were only 10 steps away, but both were ashes by the time I reached them.  I'm about to yell at the sky, I spin around and empty the clip in a panic.  Two headcrabbies drop.  I reload and drop three more.  Woot.  I reach for another clip... Oh shit...   Nothing.  That was a lot fewer bullets than I thought would be in there.  I should run...  I'm in a side-office

**Respawn** Now I know I can get a gun, but  became a tour guide all of the along the way, bringing all sorts of fun commentary.    

All of that took place in what was originally one long winding hallway.  

It's entirely possible that many players will miss that first ""teammate"" completely.  That same teammate might get killed really quickly

It's not that they turned Half-Life into DE

Sorry to go on like that

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
From IOS:

**Good**

-Opening cutscene was fantastic

-Excellent musical score

-Extensive character customization 

-Levels clearly have hidden/multiple paths and secrets similar to the original game

-The Detroit hub is huge

-The social ""boss fight"" was excellent
well written

-Played through without cover and had no problems. 

-Hacking is very enjoyable

**Bad**

-The opening sequence sucked. You're walking on rails half the time
-Sariff Industries is kind of dull

Pritchard/Sariff/Malik are the only people you really get to know and they aren't as interesting (so far) as the UNATCO crew. Its also kind of...bland looking for the most part

-Head bobbing. Needs to go.

-Graphics are underwhelming but everyone already knows that

-Pre-rendered cutscenes kind of take you out of the immersion

-An overall disconnect from the world. You walk into an office filled with items

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Uberjann

I might get banned for this. 8) Couldn't resist fetching the leak, but you get used to them. Everything is just soaked in atmosphere and detail. Shooting and movement feel excellent. And the music, . Cut-scenes are pre-rendered, but the transitions between them and gameplay are very smooth.

Yeah

There's some cool graphical effects going on. Floors and walls glimmer when you're standing still. The smoke and lighting effects somehow seem unique. I mean, but this is really working for me. It's not realistic, but it's as if it has a unique style (which I also normally hate). It's kind of two-sided, though. It seems almost like they've been using older technology, but have put more work into things. It looks different from everything else. But like I said, I think the visuals as a whole are very impressive. Also, ragdolls here seem really good just from the fact I haven't actually noticed them.

On the gameplay-side of things, it's very smooth and responsive. 8) You won't get killed if you're fast. I like the way enemies react and move, though. That said, gunplay feels fun and rewarding.

The coolest thing for me is all the detail. Every room is different. There's tons of books, just looking at stuff, soaking in the atmosphere.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
From Gvaz

I noticed that you can't get the config menu to come up again unless you force one of your two monitors off and if you mess it up the first time

Also can't mousewheel through the keyboard hotkey menu.

Also can't mousewheel the stuff like volume or mouse sensitivity up or down.

Everything else seems pretty standard for the UI though.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
From Numinous (this one is pretty crude)

Some comments on things that it seems mostly nobody else has made or noticed

- Mouse lag is gross
- Y axis movement is slowed down as the game doesn't want you looking up or down
- Strafing is twice as fast as sprinting - why did this make it past playtesting...
- Whoever was in charge of setting the default controls should be placed back in Barbie Adventures. CTRL for walk? Right click for cover? 
- Combat is... ridiculously easy - our fears have been realized. Cover makes the entire gameplay experience a joke. Headshots insta kill and there's nothing stopping you lining up a shot and pressing shoot. On ""Deus Ex"" mode.
- Story and characters are reaaaally thin and obvious. I could probably correctly guess the entire story and all of the twists by the first hour.
- The aug menu and such are gross gross gross gross gross
- Heard a hint of Deus Ex music near the start
- I feel like after 1 hour of play I've solved the whole game. With all the overpowered augs I can't imagine there being much fun to be had in the combat/stealth in the rest
- When you holster your weapon then press sprint it cancels the holster
- People that are telling you ""it's totally playable without cover it's great"" are wrong. Period. The only reason it ""works"" is due to the AI being slow to react and telegraphing their animations constantly so you just crouch slide walk out of cover and pop heads everywhere. When you actually play like this though it just feels wrong.
- Pet peeve - why the hell
- Why cutscenes why

- Jumping is cool - hold for higher jump
- Enemies feel really solid and the death animations and physics are heavy. They also drop their guns which you have to loot separately which I like
- Main hub city is pretty cool and npc's say lots of varied things (though nothing of any importance)
- The details and style are really nice. However
- I like how you have to actually look at things to interact with them - as opposed to ""stand in the general vicinity and press X"" - though this coolness was quite lessened when I realized the reason it was like this was probably because of the highlighting

I sort of feel that this preview leak was a bit of karma - making up for the lack of information over the past couple years. I hope Eidos aren't fretting about it too much

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit : user Numinous had a change of heart.

Heavy gameplay spoilers that have led to my pre-order;

I zoomed in with a tranq rifle and said... this is Deus Ex

Heard someone whistling the DX1 menu theme.

Knocked a cop out in the police station with noone around. Someone heard it, and go back to their business. Awesome.

Nobody else needs to say anything. If the preview has convinced me

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit : User IOS 

Alright

The police station mission was great. I chose to do the social boss fight to get in (although I stumbled upon at least two other entrances besides the front door

In a way this reminds me a bit more of** Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines** for a few reasons. Obviously there's the third person/regenerating health/takedown/limited interactivity comparisons. But also the way the sidequests are handled. They're so long and indepth that they completely distract you from the main mission. Plus the way conversations are handled

I just upgraded Hacking to Lvl 3 so I'm going to go hack into the restricted area of the police station and hack some offices in Sariff Industries to read some email. More to come.

* An EMP damage upgrade for one of the weapons (probably machine pistol
* More bots in more areas with computers that are better guarded and so harder to hack.
* Enemies responding better to bots. Hacking bots seemed to be a instant win button when I did it. Some enemies thrown EMP grenades at you but I never saw one throwing one at a bot.
* When a bot is hacked the stealth enemies should cloak and run to the computer and unhack it instead of just shooting it like idiots.
* Enemies that thrown gas grenades should have the gas immunity aug or at least gasmasks.
* Enemies with the x-ray vision aug. They should have no helmets and obviously augmented vision (like Gunther in Deus Ex) so you can pick them out and their cone of vision should be a special colour on the radar whenever they turned the aug on. This would have the dual effect of adding another layer of difficulty to stealth and also making the cone of vision aug more useful.
* Make the aug that doubles the radar range also make the map details show up on the radar.
* Make the radar an upgrade rather than given. Have Sarif give you a paraxis in the flight over to the first mission and ask you how you want to handle it. If you say sneak he advises you to buy radar and if you say go in fighting he suggests aim stabilization or something.
* Make the pheromone release a separate aug to the social enhancer.
* Make the punch through walls upgrade also give the option to punch through locked doors. This would make it a bit of an alternative to having to run around for codes (or waste explosives) for non-hacking characters and make up a bit for the lack of lockpicking.
* Enemies with sprint aug.
* Built in alternative ways of beating the bosses. Something as drastic as the kill phrases from Deus Ex isn't necessary but things like having a hackable security system in a boss arena or some system to be able to flood part of the arena with gas.
* More sidequests including some that are simply impossible to complete without certain playstyles. A sidequest where you have to kill somone. A sidequest where if you're seen it's an instant failure. A sidequest that requires level 4 or 5 hacking etc.
* Heavy-grade enemies using a rocket launcher occasionally in the more open areas (especially in accompanied by large bots)


Edit: I forgot:

* Split the social aug into two seperate augs. One for the pheromones
* More gameplay/climactic/whatever you call them conversations. Loved them.

I started making Let's Plays on YouTube a few months ago, things to pay special attention to, etc.  It made for an amazing experience for myself, and I would receive a lot of messages saying that they rather enjoyed watching someone play through one of their favorite games for the first time.  Since then, I've played through all of the Half Life series, moved on to Portal, Bioshock

I'm not here to just drop my channel name looking for views or anything.  I'm looking to invite any willing participants to partake in my first play through of a game that slipped WAY under my radar.  The original Deus Ex is incredibly deep in so many ways.  I often find myself forgetting that this game was created in 2000!  I'd love to have some you Deus Ex veterans come over and see if it's something you'd be interested in following/participating in.

Some of you may remember that ""dzabb"" was really awesome some while back in a reddit post ([LINK](http://redd.it/k2i4i)) putting up some of the Ebooks that can be read in DX:HR.  They can be found here ([LINK](http://dzabb.cba.pl/deusex/books.html)).

Which were ripped by ""paulanerspezi"" in his reddit post here ([LINK](http://redd.it/k1e4c)).

I just wanted to point out those reddit posts and point you all towards ""dzabb's"" and ""paulanerspezi's"" links for any of the new folks that have recently joined us.  

As well

I would be quite willing to copy down from my PS3 and put them into a word doc and pass them along or jump into the wiki to help out.  Just wondering if any of you fine folks have attempted at something akin to a collecting of the Ebooks?  

I'm really itching to find every Ebook possible so that we can have a pretty comprehensive ""Lore"" of the DX:HR universe.

Hey everyone! So per the post from last week, rather then the entire game (for now). (For example, if I die in Detroit I have to restart to where you first get there, or if I die in Highland Park I have to restart that mission.) I decided to record it and include tips/info as well, in case anybody is interested at all. I'm hoping it will be interesting to both newbies to the game, and those that have played it before.

I'm thinking of new challenges for the game, on Give Me Deus Ex, you can easily get one shot by a shotgun or a headshot with a pistol. It doesn't help that the AI is really accurate at shooting (unrealistically so, honestly). Still, I can't shake the hankering to try it. I think it's definitely possible.

It would need to be largely stealth, and enjoyable. Trying to think what augs to get, and I think something like this would be a priority:

* Hacking (always
* Dermal Armor
* Icarus (because there are way too many times where I've accidentally died from fall damage)
* Cloaking
* See through walls

I think those would be the most important

What do you guys think? Anyone want to try it with me? Also, it just takes a lot of time to punch everybody, and I feel like I kind of need a bit of variety before moving on with that playthrough. (Honestly I'm a tad burnt out on the punching everybody thing at the moment.)

-----------------------------------------------------------
* **here's some suggestions I have that aren't platform specific: see how much you have to commit to playing one way through a level. For example

If you get surrounded by enemies and get detected



* **Check out the skill tree

Some really powerful augs have been announced
Praxis points are pretty hard to come by so far. After ~two hours of playtime I've received a total of two. Most upgrades already cost two points. Hard to say how it'll scale later on.


*** If you get to see it

Haven't tried that yet


* **The latest round of f--ing sperging discussion about this game is that every room has you hiding behind a crate playing whack-a-mole. If you could confirm/deny this

Kind of yes. I mean it's a cover shooter. You sit in cover and shoot dudes. But you can't sit in place. Enemies pack so much firepower and know how to aim at your hiding place that you'll get your ass off if you sit in place and pop up to shoot

But like I said


*  **Just a practical overview of how both sneaking and gunplay work and feel

Sneaking works much like in Deus Ex. Move while crouched, letting go unglues you. As long as enemies don't actually see you, you can move around them to flank while they blast at your old hiding place.


* **Any info on how much the story changes and how people treat you depending on what you do would be awesome

Haven't seen reactions change yet. I've been a sarcastic and argumentative  towards my boss but his attitude hasn't changed. 


* **- If you'll be playing a sufficient slice of the story

The writing and story seem very cyberpunk 101. Evil corporations


* ** - As others have mentioned


10K is a decent chunk of change


* **- Ammo

 Haven't seen any non-standard ammo yet, so ammo for those is plentiful. Ammo for everything else is hell of scarce.


* **Grenades, how does the mechanic of make-your-own-mines work.**

Haven't tried making mines yet


* **Praxis points, trying out various loop-holes like knocking out a guard, letting a buddy revive him, separate them and knocking him out again aka does it still generate XP, if they can be purchased as software and how much does it cost if you go that route.**

Praxis points come slow, traveling through hidden routes etc. I'll try that exploit 


* **- Inventory, possible foodstuffs, drinks, booze etc.**

Inventory kind of sucks. Playing Tetris with all the stuff you come across isn't very much fun and there's so much  you come across that you have to dump most of it.

* **A general take on level design and routes, how feasible would making your own routes be, etc...**

Levels feel good. A facility might have two or three corridors leading into the same warehouse


* **How aggressive the AI is in flanking or flushing you out

The AI isn't very aggressive. They're happy to sit in cover and take potshots while one dude tries to rush you. Maybe this changes as they go from low level thugs to professionals


* **- If you'll be playing the PC version

Playing PC

* **A bit of an insight into the rewards for being an explorationist would be nice

So far the rewards seem to be mostly fluff


* **...how does the purchasing system actually work? Is is in-conversation or a Fallout-style buying screen (or something completely different)? Do you mainly buy from respectable shops

It's a buying screen which works much like the PS3's XMB. You scroll horizontally between categories and vertically through items in that category. So far I've bought mostly from shady street dealers


* **I know it's kind of an abstract question, have to think out an approach, plan, etc. Or are the alternate paths so obviously pointed out it's usually a decision of 'well do I fight or stealth' through this section.**

No


* **More importantly though

It's fun. I'm not quite in the ""amazing"" territory yet but I'm hoping it'll get there.

* **also how stupid are the takedowns? does that animation get old?**

There seem to be quite a few of them. 


* **One last question

Oh yes

The first level is a large office building / warehouse and the shelves


* **What difficulty are you playing at

Normal. I always play review games on normal the first time around

Nonetheless I liked the ending videos themselves a lot! I struggled between Hugh Darrow's ending and the destruction of panchea - in the end I chose the *Destruct Panchea*-ending for myself. Of course I watched them all but that was the one I *really* chose. I felt like it was the most fitting for my Adam after all the struggle and self-hatred he's had with himself becoming augmented (broken mirror) and especially all the things he came to know during the course of the game. About himself and his involvement in all this and especially about the irresponsible and/or despotic agendas all those puppet masters on Panchea pursue. May the world get rid of them and find a thoughtful moment to breathe and reflect on the implications of these world-changing technologies and how to use them.

1314594961.0,jxoop,Regarding weapon upgrades and item-management,Terr_,17,1,9,"There was another post on this

* When you upgrade a weapon
* When you pick up a weapon and already have another of the same type
* AFAIK you will never ever find an already-upgraded weapon ""in the wild"". The only way for an upgraded weapon to be on the ground is if you were the one who dropped it.
* Arms-dealers will *not* give you any extra money when you sell them a ""generically"" upgraded weapon

Merging Example:

0. Start with Shorgun #1 in you inventory.
1. Upgrade Shotgun #1 with a damage mod.
2. Drop Shotgun #1.
3. Pick up Shotgun #2.
4. Upgrade Shotgun #2 with a burst-fire mod.
5. Pick up Shotgun #1 again

I'm attempting to go much

A little more background: I did a standard playthrough of DX -- stealthy, book, terminal, e-mail, PSA...everything, and writing down anything I thought to be significant. Undoubtedly, this was quite a lot (57 8.5x11's [albeit in a decent sized handwriting!]). I'm now going through, and analyzing everything as holistically as possible -- linking everything back and forth through the game's plot and backstory. I'm taking hints from a script dump on GameFAQs

The project is to be hosted on shoutwiki or wikia

I hope to be done in time for the launch of DX3 (which I sadly will not be able to partake in). I am ** *not* ** treating DX2 as canon.

Anyway
&gt; ==Further Analysis==

&gt; The Universal Constructor, everything, in seconds, on command. Astonishing -- the possibilities would be endless. As a class of Von Neumann devices, ""Molecular Assemblers"", being the central idea behind a UC, but not a UC itself

&gt; The technology which powers a large portion of this game's narrative is also central to the player character and primary antagonists. Replication of the cells behind nano-augged agents, JC, Page, Simons, and Tong are all ** *Universal Constructors* **. I think one of the biggest cases in point is the killswitch: an unchecked, exponential replication of cells and machines, resulting in such a powerful shock to the system that the human itself shuts down. Not only are JC and Paul killing machines, more or less, essentially creating more of itself with the whole world as its petri dish. 24 hours is also fairly arbitrary and slow; UNATCO could simply have programmed it to be an instantaneous replication of every machine and every cell

And [here's a link to the project itself, so edits have been impossible beyond page 7.

However, NSF, or why Megan has suddenly or perhaps been backstabbing Adam all this time.  It shouldn't have to take a scene after the credits to show who she really was.  The game also barely explains the origins of Manderly or Bob Page.  I can only believe this may confuse players who never played the first game as to who Bob even is since they only showed him once in the beginning.  More importantly, who really is Adam Jensen?  We are left not to know how he was made into what he is.  Why is a superior being with DNA that doesn't have rejection effects to augmentations?  Spontaneous evolution?  His background is pretty brief in a sidequest and in explained in some e-mails but I feel like this was overlooked a lot.  We learn little of the Illuminati's plan from augmentation to suddenly changes focus to the Grey Death in the first for population control nor the birth of nanotechnology.  While this is explained in some backstory readings of DX1, I still feel it is left out in DX:HR.  There are some other weird plot issues I found to be bothering me but nothing as big as those."")
