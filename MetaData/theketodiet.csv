My girlfriend and I have been ketoer's since the beginning of this year. I am almost to my goal weight

My girlfriend (let's call her H), ""Enough, its time to lose weight."" She and I embarked on the keto lifestyle, eating lots of bacon, chicken, hamburgers, veggies, and in hindsight

H gradually began to notice little changes in her body, and her cravings gradually subsided. H has never counted calories consistently, but she has plateaued around 140 pounds(but broke 140 today!), and she plans to start counting calories, as well as incorporate intermittent fasting!

Other details:
 as I said before, lot of fish and chicken, and she has no plans to give up keto! She does light-medium cardio 3 times a week when she can. If people want her workouts I can ask her to provide me the nitty-gritty details.



Edit: Workout details.

""Usually I like to start with the Jacob's ladder machine for 3 minutes as a warmup. I keep it on about 70-85 steps for the three minutes.

I like to do a HIIT style workout on the treadmill. 6 mph as the high intensity for three minutes

For abs, russian twists, crunches, side crunches, heel touches, bicycles, and anything else I feel like doing.""

Below are the pictures! Congrats to her! Go Keto!

I was really, but after seeing this pic from this past weekend I couldn't help myself. Sorry in advance for the wall of text. My fiancee says I'm always too TL;DR. 

Last year around this time I was around 250, I knew I couldn't fit in anything else, so any sort of exercise regimen wouldn't work. I had been lurking in /r/keto for awhile but was too afraid to start. I tried to change my overall diet, and the extra physical activity helped towards losing a bit, but I need some serious help. I felt sick all the time. Tired. It was normal for me to be on the toilet 4-5 times a day. Always had stomach issues. High blood pressure. Bad skin. Just ... a mess.

So, etc.) but that since I do most of the cooking, I need to make sure that she's still eating the way she likes to eat -- ends up that most of what I like to cook is keto with sides of non-keto. Whatever I make, I'll just make a side of rice, or pasta, or some bread, and it's the same foods we were eating before! Her weight has been maintained, so we're both pretty happy (although she says my shoulders used to be a lot more comfy when they were squishy).

I log all of my food on MyFitnessPal (feel free to add me there as big_onion!), my weight isn't going up, which tells me I've become accustomed to eating in such a way that it feels natural to me. I try and eat a lot of veggies, though if I feel like I've stalled a lot I'll go into what I call ""keto hardcore"" and cut back on some stuff except for the very high fiber veggies. I usually feel like shit on those days as I'm not getting enough nutrients, but I usually do that if I feel in a slump and only for a few days. It's usually followed by the I NEED SALAD EVERY MEAL FOR A WEEK craving. 

I don't cheat. Sure, or even went to a Chinese buffet (which is surprisingly not bad, if you can find a good one), but I ate those things fully aware of how I'd have to adjust my eating habits immediately following to make up for it. . I tried to plan eating more carbs (especially going out to eat, when the ingredients may be unknown) before days of heavy farm work. To me, cheating implies just out of the blue inhaling a donut or something without any forethought. Call it what you will, but if I thought of it as cheating I'd spend far too much time stressing out about doing something wrong

So, which was what I remember weighing in 1998 when I graduated from high school. I'm no longer obese, according to Libra, and just plain ol' overweight. I feel amazing most days, and the days I don't feel amazing I usually know that I'm ""missing"" something (probably not eating enough variety). I got some bloodwork done last month and everything was right smack in the middle normal. BP, lipids, everything. I was shocked, so seeing the data was very

I feel like my progress may have been slower than most, usually with flavored water or diet soda) and too many nights of eating late dinners. Regardless, I've been very happy with it. It's been a slow enough progression that I obviously didn't notice the body change until I saw these pics side-by-side (even the fact that ALL of my jeans can be taken off without unbuttoning didn't register with me).

As I approach my goal, I milk goats every day and hardly get to enjoy it!) and FRUIT. We produce meat, eggs, and dairy on the farm (all pastured birds and grass fed livestock) so I feel like a more paleo approach will work, but I'll worry about that when I get there. I don't miss the carbs. They make me feel sick. I do miss fruit and goat milk (which does NOT make me feel sick!), and we have a LOT of fruit growing on the property. This past year I made wine out of a lot of it so it certainly went to use, but let me tell you how frustrating it was this Christmas when we made hundreds of jars of preserves, and other farm-made fruit goodies.

Cheers, and the web. I never cease to be inspired by or to learn from your stories, whether they be successes or failures. For those of you just starting, it's hard, but you'll find your groove. Take advantage of the groups you find here: sure you can diet on your own, but losing weight with this awesome community is just way too much fun.

And then life happened. I was good. I was strong through the holidays. Allowing myself to have up to 50g of carbs in stead of my usual 20g on holidays. I lost weight straight through them. And then the month of stupid happened. 

My birthday is one week before valentine's day. My anniversary is shortly thereafter. So I figured FUCK IT. I'm gonna go off keto for a week or so

Here I am, there are not a lot of easily accessible options for food that's keto friendly, and quick enough to grab so that I still have time to eat on my break. So I've been eating a lot of pretzels. I suck at planning to bring food with me. 

But no more. I haven't been on a scale in weeks but my clothes still fit the same. I feel like shit. I'm always tired. Tomorrow morning I am back on the keto train. 

But for some of you who may be discouraged,False,self,t5_2vztm,False,,,t3_1asmdr

I've been seeing some ""what do I eat/what do people eat?"" posts lately, but quick-and-dirty-how-to-get-through-and-thrive sorts of things). 

The ""I couldn't survive on keto without...."" stuff.  Here's mine:

* **Roasted Chicken**. Every week, but laaaazy) and separate the meat from the bones. Then I immediately huck the bones + salt + Bragg's amino acids into a pot with some water, and make a delicious chicken broth.

Chicken broth goes into the fridge

Chicken meat gets eaten either dipped in something delicious (mayo, blue cheese dressing, etc. Also cut up and thrown in with veggie stir-frys, or thrown in breakfast-eggs.

* meat sticks of various sort (I like chorizo sticks

* bacon. I know, and you don't get grease spatters everywhere. Fuck frying bacon. When you bake it, you can also coat it with whatever spices you want. 

* beef jerky (I make my own homemade. There's been a few threads about this lately). A basic dehydrator can be had for like $35 on Amazon. WORTH IT. 

* [individually-portioned brie bites!!](http://iledefrancecheese.com/index.php/Ile-de-France-single-serve-brie-bites.php)

* cans of coconut milk/coconut oil. That shit goes in/on everything. Including my hair. 

* When I'm desperate for a smoothie, some whey protein powder, and ice. It's pretty lavender, and also delicious. 

* Trader Joe's. HEAVEN. They have pre-cooked carnitas that are fabulous...and also their pre-packed meat and cheese trays [Citterio Fresco brand](http://www.citteriousa.com/products-fresco.html) are great to take for lunches.

My results (to which I stared at with a ""DA-FUQ?!"" face) are below:

Weight lost since last October: 16 pounds (again, but it still is, as it was done solely through the keto diet, without exercise [as a baseline to see if food alone was the cause])

Optimal ranges are according to the materials I was given by the nurse:

Total cholesterol level: 174 (optimal is less than 200); I don't have my previous score to compare it to

HDL (Good) cholesterol: 82 (optimal is more than 60); went up from 70 during last year's test: health improved

Total cholesterol to HDL ratio: 2.1 (optimal is less than 3.5); went down from 2.9 during last year's test: health improved

Glucose: 88 (70-99 is normal

Pulse: 68 (normal)

Blood pressure: 116/86 (normal-ish, so the nurse said that could affect it)

The nurse actually said to me “Do you do a lot of cardio?, ""Whatever you’re doing, keep it up! Your numbers are great!” I then explained keto to her, and I don't think she understood it.

So, but I was not truly a believer. I needed to see numbers for myself.

I am now a true believer in Keto! I am drinking the [sugar-free] keto kool-aid and am back at it.

* First we have William Banting in 1862: http://www.mediafire.com/view/?dihm6p5y8ah1w33
* Then followed Vilhjalmur Stefansson:  http://www.mediafire.com/view/?cdb99lowc6bedid and http://www.mediafire.com/view/?l03rvxfqqe24pxb
* Blake Donaldson based his Eskimo diet on Stefansson's findings:  http://www.lowcarb.ca/atkins-diet-and-low-carb-plans/eskimo-diet-donaldson.html
* Donaldson's diet was cited by A.W. Pennington: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/1/5/343.full.pdf
* And this article about Pennington was published in Holiday Magazine in 1950: http://www.mediafire.com/view/?f8gzqrdwckjykfa
* In 1958
* T.L. Cleave publishes his first paper on low carb in 1956
* Yudkin cites T.L. Cleave in his 1972 publication of ""Pure

After Atkins, South Beach, ""Good Calories, Bad Calories"" and of course r/keto.

1362535833.0,19qyee,Father just got his bi-year blood work back.  He is now a believer of keto!  ,Celco217,38,6,16,"Little backstory... father is 55 years old, he started going through a divorce with my mom (31 years of marriage).  Weight started to climb again and got back up to around 330lbs. Boils down to him getting discouraged about his weight often

Anyways around mid January, not that big of deal for me.   

After about a month an a half now on keto

So he goes to his appointment, and munching fat... hes getting ready for some serious health problems.  They do their best to scare him, take blood and tell them they will call with results.  

Well... he just got the numbers back.  After slowly rising cholesterol numbers over the past 3 or so years even with being on blood pressure  and cholesterol meds
From his blood test back in October to his test now... 
Total Cholesterol: From 227 down to 161
HDL: From 50 up to 66
LDL: From 150 down to 91
Triglycerides: From 173 down to 49!!!! (WOW!)

Im so proud of him!  Even if he is not losing alot of weight, grease, and veggies would kick so much ass on dropping his cholesterol so greatly when all other attempts have failed.  Brief talk with the doctors office gave him hope about maybe getting off his meds if the numbers stay good. 

He is the ""average american"".  Ate the food pyramid, working his 50 hour weeks to have some money in his pocket, hit by the economy, had to file bankruptcy and foreclosure of the house (Mainly thanks to the ex fucking him over in the divorce). This should be a case study example for anyone.  Gary Taubes has it right.  


**tl;dr: Dad is 55. On BP and Statin drugs. Had gastric bypass. Been on Keto ~1.5 months. Bi-yearly bloodwork compared to his last test in October... Total Cholesterol: 227&gt;161, Triglycerides: 173&gt;49.  Might not be losing too much weight (about 6lbs now) but his blood is healthy like a mother fucker now!  Keto on!**

- Butter or coconut oil
- Slivered or sliced almonds
- Salt
- Pepper
- Powdered ginger
- Lemon juice

&gt; - Snap asparagus in your fingers so that it breaks at about the middle; you can also just slice off the woody parts by touch.
- Heat a pan over medium heat until it reaches a stable temperature
- Add 1tbsp butter or coconut oil
- Add asparagus and toss to coat in the oil; keep tossing it periodically
- Add 1/4 cup slivered or sliced almonds
- Add a pinch of salt
- Cook, about 5-7 minutes. Once it does, start checking its texture by noshing on the stem end. When the texture of the stem end is like a fresh apple slice - crisp, not chewy, not woody - the asparagus is done.
- Drizzle very lightly with lemon juice and serve",self,t5_2vztm,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/theketodiet/comments/1b4n5y/asparagus_is_in_season_eat_it_while_its_at_its/

I felt a little better... but by 4 I didn't feel like my cheese

I started being concious about what I ate when I was 265lbs, and start to feel better about myself. I didn't concern myself with protein or carbs, and adhered to the typical ""low fat, low cal"" way of thought that the media/food industry basically forces on everyone. 

Well, and I lost weight fast. I was at my lightest two winters ago, when I was 155-160lbs. It was far, far too much (for contrast, I'm sitting at 185lbs right now, and I feel great.) 

I looked back on myfitnesspal to see the average of carbohydrates/fats/proteins I was eating daily at this point, only 50-100g of proteins, and on some days, as little as 15-30g of protein. My average caloric intake daily at this point was 1700. I wasn't cheating, whatsoever. 

At this point, but I was happy that I was so slender for the first time in my life. I was however, obsessed with food. I wasn't happy with the amount of food I was eating, and it was a constant source of stress and anxiety. 

Fast forward to now. I gained some of that weight back (thankfully..) and evened out at about 185. I was ""skinny fat"" (which I'm still working on.)

It's been 5 weeks into starting keto, or just under. I'm working out 5 days a week, lifting heavy at the gym, doing squats, presses, etc. My body fat percentage is sitting at about 19%, and I'm much more muscular than I've ever been. I've lost 5lbs so far with keto

Here's the best part though. I'm happy with the food I'm eating. 

Really, beating myself up for wanting to go get a snack. I feel healthier. I'm putting more REAL, UNPROCESSED foods into my body. I'm eating vegetables, good fats, quality proteins, and I'm having fun doing it. I'm cooking more. And best of all, if I engorge myself on food (like I did last night. Honestly, I was ravenously hungry after an intense leg routine at the gym.) I don't hate myself for it. I don't wake up bloated, I know.) I just keep calm and Keto on

For the first time since my weightloss journey began

And THAT'S why I enjoy, more enjoyable alternative. 

I hope some reads this and takes something from it. If not

The first two are from yesterday morning (Jan 8), and my most current starting weight in November, which I believe is my heaviest weight, ever.

[My MyFitnessPal Food Diary](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/100PoundChallenge)

I've been counting my calories below 1500, but I'm working on that.

For exercise, and hip pain that tends to set in relatively quickly with prolonged walking or other stressful physical activity.  Instead, I've been working on a weight training routine that I actually stole from another redditor.

Mainly it's been a three-routine rotation between working my chest/arms

At the beginning of last year, I was going to 'reward' myself with a tattoo either on my chest or back (only if I could decide on something that was very significant to me and that I wouldn't regret).  Unfortunately, after a month I fell off and remained docile for the next six or so months.  In July I had another short stint that ended poorly, and I began again in November after my brother and his girlfriend encouraged me to join /r/loseit, I was then referred to the keto subreddit and have been doing a keto diet since.

Starting at 361.6 in November, digital scale—which seemed to have consistency problems—to the standing balance scale at my gym.  The difference was around 8 pounds at the time, and I pulled my loss back from 25 pounds to 19 pounds, because I wanted to be sure that I was correct about my numbers.

So, except that I would aim (not unhealthily force myself) to lose 100 pounds within *six* months instead.  I actually bought myself this camera to start taking better photos and even recording video of my weekly progress to perhaps begin posting weekly recap videos of my health routines (I have yet to edit something together from the first week, but I'm working on it).  The camera arrived a few days ago, and the Week Two photos are the first to be taken with it.

I'm sure a lot of this is water weight and I may very well wind up gaining some back relatively soon, but it feels unbelievable.  I haven't been below 300 pounds in I don't know how many years now.  I used to tell myself that if I ever got over 300 pounds, I didn't know what I'd do to myself (of course I wasn't serious, but still).  Now, I don't know how I'm going to ultimately celebrate being under that number, and I can't wait to be there.",,self,,

&gt;I'm going to do what wasn't done before the change (that I'm aware of).

THIS POST is me saying that I'm not trying to ignore the general population of [1] /r/keto.

&gt;This situation has gotten very out of hand and cost the community 2 very important mods that were some of the lifeblood of this subreddit. I will not tolerate any hateful nonsense. I will delete posts volatile in nature that are in no sense related to the issue at hand.

I'm going to be starting keto on Monday (April 29th)and I just want to make sure I'm prepared and have it all figured out. 

I've done low carb diets before

I'm also a little overwhelmed because it seems so complicated. I'm very spontaneous in the kitchen. When I  cook something

Does that sound right? or am I over thinking this? 

Additional info in case it matters. I started last fall at 219lbs. I was originally counting calories, I could just have as much of whatever I wanted from the permissible foods. I made it to 189lbs before I stalled and gave up. Incredibly, I've managed to maintain around 189 without any effort. I don't have an official goal weight. Maybe 170 would be ok. But I'll reevaluate when I get there. 

I've chosen to start on Monday because I figured it would give me time to prepare. Plus it's my wedding anniversary and birthday this weekend so I figure there will be cake and dinners out and it's probably just easier to wait until that's all over.

Grab yourself some egg whites and Isopure protein powder (http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/nb/lowcarb.html) and you're good to go.

For 1 serving you'll need:
1 cup egg whites.
1 scoop Isopure (flavor of choice).
1 tsp Cinnamon (optional)

Mix

Calories: Approximately 200.
Protein: 50g
Fat: 1g
Carbs: 0g

Plus you get all the amino acids and vitamins from the Isopure. :)

As I originally said, be a keto food. But it'll help keep your keto meals lower calorie! Just add some butter and sausage and you're set! ;)

Now, as the last thing I would want to do is give someone the wrong information.

That being said..

I worry that people are arbitrarily consuming pure fat foods in order to reach the macros and number of grams of fats provided for them from things like the keto calculator.

The way I look at it, utilize the macros and make sure that you aren't overdoing it when it comes to carb and protein intake.

But, and eat that much daily, then by all means, take a few shots of fat and hit your caloric goal. If you aren't hungry, and can cut the calories, do that. The macros are only there people who are eating a consistent amount of calories daily, and serve as a guide.

You want to 1.) eat as little carbs as possible, at the least. If you want to build muscle, this number goes up, obviously.)

The rest of your calories for the day should come from fat. But you don't HAVE to eat all that fat to make sure you're hitting a macro, and your body will then use it's own fat stores as energy, hence the fat loss the keto diet provides.

Don't arbitrarily take in fat just to ""hit a macro."" Do it if you're hungry. If you're not

Not trying to sound preachy, at the end of the day sees a caloric deficit from what they planned on eating, and seeing a lower number of fat grams from what they thought they were going to take in, down a tablespoon of coconut oil or cream just because they think they should. That's unnecessary calories if you're not hungry!

Again

Keto on!

2 garlic cloves finely chopped
1 tbsp butter
1 tsp salt
1.3 lbs ground beef (I used Kirkland Organic)
1 large egg

2 strips thick bacon
1/4 cup tomato sauce from can

Heat oven to 375 with rack in the middle
Combine crushed pork rinds &amp; heavy cream in a bowl and set aside
Saute onion
Combine beef, Frank’s Hot Sauce, paprika, black pepper &amp; salt
Add celery/onion/garlic mixture and pork rinds/heavy cream mixture to beef mixture
Combine ingredients evenly
Cut 2 strips of bacon in half and place them crosswise over the loaf
Bake for until mixture reaches 160 degrees Fahrenheit (about 40-45 mins) **

  ** Personally I worry about undercooking the meat whenever I make meatloaf so I back until it appears to be cooked through the center when I cut into it.  This takes closer to 1 hour.  I still broil it for 3 minutes to make that bacon more crispy on top too.**

If bacon on top isn’t crispy reset the oven to broil &amp; broil the meatloaf 4-5 inches from the heat until the bacon is crisp &amp; browned (2-3 mins)

Let the meatloaf rest for 10 mins before transferring it to a platter

I have a two-fold question though. I'm on a tight budget, tuna or other protein with arugula or spinach and some cheese for lunch and snack, and a chicken thigh with skin and green beans with mushrooms for dinner. Its a very filling meal plan, so I have no need for anything else. However, is it ok to be way below my daily carb macro? At most I'm eating 10grams of carbs a day. I'm also getting a bit too much fat and not enough protein, so does anyone have any suggestions for high-protein snacks that don't have much fat to them? Or is it ok to leave the protein amount a bit below the macro level if you're getting plenty of fat in your diet? For next week, I'm planning on getting chicken breasts with no skin, so that will fix some of the fat levels. But I was curious about the carb and protein levels.

talking to my wife about bacon and heard that she cooks it in a cold pan as well... I was flabbergasted!!! She always complains how she can never cook the bacon as well as I can. (I thought she was just lying apache didn't have to make herself bacon anymore)

Apparently it says on the back to cook that way - - again

So here's how I cook my bacon: 

-Take cast iron skillet put on medium high heat until handle is hot or bacon sizzles as soon as you touch the pan.

- Lay bacon flat 4 at a time or however many will fit with out crowding. (Never lay them on top of each other).

- wait until bacon starts to shrivel up

- edges will start to turn golden brown. 

- flip!

- Exact same process on this side. (Bacon will have decreased on size; by how much depends on quality and brand).

- once golden brown flip again and let sit for about 10 seconds to crisp. 

- remove from skillet and place on paper towel. This will take some of the grease from bacon to prevent any sogginess.

This creates the PERFECT brown

So


For me


Buffalo Wings


I don't do anything super fancy. I will either deep fry wing pieces or I'll bake them before tossing in buffalo sauce. 


Deep fry method:


* Heat oil and fry wing pieces for 3 mins/batch
* Immediately toss in buffalo sauce in a large bowl
* Serve with blue cheese dressing


Baked method:


* Preheat oven to 375
* Line baking sheet with tin foil and place a cooling rack on top of the baking sheet; spray the cooling rack with non-stick spray
* Place wings on cooling rack and bake for 1 hour or until crispy - I usually turn them over half way
* Immediately toss in buffalo sauce in a large bowl
* Serve with blue cheese dressing


Buffalo Dip


* Buy a roasted chicken and debone that beast and cut up the meat.
* 1 package soften cream cheese
* 1-2 cups blue cheese crumbles
* Buffalo sauce of your choice 

Mix it all together. You can cook this in a crock pot on high for 1-2 hours and it's divine. It can also be baked - I've done 350 for 45-60 minutes and then checked to see if the cheese has all melted. It's good for crowds because non-keto friends can use chips, and ketoers can use veggies to dip (or just eat it with a spoon like I do because it's so tasty).

1366262220.0,1cl7re,A Keto-lite Journey,blueryth,13,3,0,"I'd like to share my experiences with keto diets. Its not something epic, ~186 lbs. and my problem is that I love sugars. However

Doing a 180 with my habits was a no-go from day 1. I'm a programmer by day, hiking, physical labor. I love beer and pizza, especially in the company of friends. I eat out 60-80% of the time. I wanted a solution to my weight that involved the least time investment, and sacrificed as little of my favorite habits. Most importantly, the solution would be permanent. This isn't a problem I ever want to tackle again.

Keto isn't new to me, it would have to come with some caveats. But before I dig into those, let me get some evidence on the table:

(Sorry

[The Numbers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Aq99GUs6aPr9dGxablZZalY1OWxEdnN5LVh4XzdaRXc&amp;output=html) 

That's not a very straight line, pizza, or whatever food the gang was eating. I didn't want a diet to interfere with that, so I didn't let it. Cyclical/Targeted doesn't factor into it. This isn't cheating, this is my diet.

During the week I eat out for lunch everyday. Everyday. Its not the cheapest, that won't bend over backwards to help out. People have such ridiculous custom orders nowadays, and blow up over the tiniest inconvenience, that asking for a burrito sans tortilla really does not bother them.

After the first two weeks, so I abuse it.

Every weekday I walk for 30 minutes. No matter what happened during the day, read, fire off emails, text, listen to music, etc. A smartphone may be required. Mostly, I just need to guarantee I've actually circulated some blood during the day.

Overall I try to keep below 15g net carbs in a normal day. I only track macros and calories if I don't like the progress I'm making. Other than that, but I learn from it so it doesn't recur.

So what's the point of all of this? I don't find a lot of people treat keto the way I do. I'm not trying to preach my habits, but it almost exclusively focuses on gains, and I've unfortunately focused on losses. I enjoy reading the success of others, but I find that most people are very strict with their diet. I knew ahead of time that I wouldn't be, and that made finding examples a lot more rare.

So for anyone out there that relates with past-me

* You get what you put in. My pattern is strict

* If you're creative

* Weighing everyday is probably just as uplifting/deflating as doing it occasionally. If you're going to weigh everyday, and you still won't get a straight line.

* No matter public opinion, they generally still agree with the food pyramid. Harder with ketoers, you guys can be downright nasty about diet sodas and 'cheating'.

* If your 'cheating' is rigid and planned, but it is not an accident.

* If you do cheat

* Learn. The more you know, here.

* Luck doesn't factor into it.

I started keto on January 6 after a lot of research, which I gained back over the holidays). I'm 26, female and started at 190, the heaviest I've ever been. In almost one month I'm down a total of 7 lbs, but my weight is fluctuating and stalling between 185-183 and has been doing this for the past 2 weeks.


I feel like I'm doing very well and being very strict with my diet (will post sample menu in the comments). I'm drinking more water than usual (probably not enough), so right now I am just walking about 30 minutes a day with the dog. 


Things I think I can do better: drink more water, eat more fat.  Otherwise, I need your help to critique my diet (see comments).

Rewind back to July of 2012 (about 8 months ago).  I weighed 210 pounds, lean meats, etc).  3 months later, I was down to 185.  Religious calorie counting, running, lifting, doing the right thing.  About October, I didn't feel like going to the gym

I was fat again.  My issue is I don't like weighing myself . . . something about the ugly truth of a scale.  I knew I was fat, not knowing my start weight, and now it's 3 weeks+ later.  I've lost 2 inches around my waist, I can button the top collar of my dress shirts, and there is a hop in my step.  The miracles of Keto are true.  

Last night, I'm gonna hop on the scale.  I jump on thinking to see 185ish . . . I see 195.  I am dissapointed.  I know Keto works, my clothes are fitting again, but for some reason I expected it to be lower.  I 'feel' like I lost 15 pounds . . . did that mean I started at 210 again?  So as a PSA, even though it may bruise your ego, or downright punch it in the face (as in my case), weigh before you start so you can baseline.  

I am continuing as I enjoy the Keto lifestyle and types of food I can eat and quite frankly, and I have given up bread before so it wasn't too big a deal.  I have a before pic and when I get down to 165, I will post the before and after.

**Chicken Mushroom Alfredo:** http://i.imgur.com/tc28H.jpg

**Ingredients:**

* 1 bag of shirataki noodles: http://www.nasoya.com/products/shirataki/shirataki_spaghetti.html
* 1/4 garlic alfredo sauce
* 1 frozen chicken breast
* 3oz-ish of baby bella mushrooms
* 1 tbsp coconut oil for frying the chicken
* 1 tbsp butter
* 1 oz of shredded parmesan cheese

**Directions:**  
I started by using a smaller frying pan to get the chicken cooking in coconut oil. Then I rinsed the the shirataki noodles with hot water in a strainer to get rid of as much as possible of the nasty fish-smelling liquid they come in. I then placed them in another skillet separate from the one cooking the chicken in order to dry roast them. I just sort of guessed how long

As the chicken cooked, and let saute for a bit. I also added salt, onion powder and pepper.  

Then I added the butter to the dry roasting noodles, and covered for about 4 minutes.

I'm not sure what's relevant so here's my story:

Last fall, I didn't make diet a priority. I didn't watch what I ate at all. I stopped using MFP, but kept weighing. Oddly enough, I maintained weight. It fluctuated between 187-191 with no effort.

By April, the scale has been no different from my usual. I still fluctuate between my usual 187-191


Additional info:

- Pretty sure I'm in ketosis. I haven't used ketosticks since my understanding is that they aren't always reliable. I figure what's the point in spending money when it's not going to give me results I can rely on anyway. BUT I do have an acetone like taste in my mouth.

- I'm not very active. for actual ""exercise""

- I'm not much of a water drinker. But figuring this might be part of the problem

- I'm trying to really limit the artificial sweeteners. I think I've only had them 2 or 3 times in the last 2 weeks.  

- I'm 31 years old

150g of cream cheese (half a pack)
1/4 cup soya milk
Optional cinnamon to taste

Mix well until very smooth

Fry a ladle full at a time in a pan, and the oil foams up if it can't cope. 

Serve as you like


They were very light compared to our previous experiments with protein pancakes, but we try to avoid adding too much as they can easily become quite 'cakey'.

I was wondering if anyone else had this problem. Seeing things like ""Just get one at Walmart"" or ""You can order offline from this site that only ships to the USA."" I'm not complaining just wondering if maybe making another Sub Reddit for Keto in Asia would help to bring the information together in a much more readable form.

Thoughts on this?

Achy joints

Muscle aches (particularly in the morning)

Mildly labored breathing

Mild chest/heart ache (not quite pain)

When I used to smoke hookah off ketosis

In Ketosis, and the taste goes away after a decent brushing. I don't know if it has to do with the increased amount of lipids making it harder for toxins &amp; carcinogens to weaken the gums, but I sure am happy I don't have any notable issue with hookah smoke.

Based on the majority of the opinions on the other sub and /r/theketodiet

- Hyped up people who will suck down artificially-sweetened sodas all day

- Many others who will graciously admit that fake sugar makes them crave real sugar. 

Additionally, and in one sitting it's negligible, but it just seems like it's something I don't want to put in my body. 

***
I'm fat because I was undisciplined. I lost weight and gained it all back many different times because I relied on crap like artificial sweeteners to get my sugar fix

Today, and I've NEVER been this successful at losing weight. I'm feeling better, sleeping better, and living healthier than I ever have in my life. 

I live better because I've introduced a great deal of discipline in my life.

I know others have expressed similar thoughts after kicking all things sweet-tasting. 

***
I just think something with such an...odd background like aspartame has something wrong with it (I'm not a conspiracy theorist

And splenda is a chloronated sugar. Now, however, generally-speaking, halogenated molecules are things that are scary - hell - if we worked with ANYTHING halogenated in organic lab, we had a special waste bottle for it under a special hood. 

I'm most startled by this: People sucking down diet coke by 2-3 liters a day in lieu of water. That is vice replacement

***

Can we have a real discussion about how artificial sugars have hindered our progress in the past
