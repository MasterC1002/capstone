I went to the bar I work at after that. Everyone is giving me some of their shifts so I can get back on my feet faster plus a ton of couches and guest beds to crash on. Also they got me good and wasted.

Yesterday I get a call from my old bar, bought me dinner, and the bar manager gave me two work shirts and an open tab as well.

We take care of our own and that's why I love the service industry. We're hard

So to my brothers and sisters that have shared that proverbial shift beer with me after three doubles in a row I say thank you for making this kind of job bearable enough by simply caring for each other.

1361855632.0,198r7n,I do the dishes (x-post from r/pettyrevenge),macgillweer,189,17,38,"I was told to post this here as well.

I started off working in kitchens as a dishwasher. In case you don't know, because nobody wants to do that if they quit. I actually liked it. Turn on the music, load up the wrack, dirty dishes in, clean out, wax on, wax off... you get the picture. I would actually use the time to go over my college homework, and even design D&amp;D worlds, etc... and moved to a bigger, and took the job

I was good at this, lazy bitch who threw temper tantrums in my kitchen. 6 nights a week, 60+ hours, and I loved it. Things were great, I got a few awards, it was awesome. Then I asked for a raise. ""Sure, its in the works"" was the reply for about 8 months. Then they switched bosses, yeah, then I say ""Look

So I kept doing the job, at a salary much higher than my old rate, and I ask if I can get that salary as a sous chef. ""Well, you have to apply for the job,"" which I had been doing for 5 years. ""Fine, I'm no longer a sous chef. Find somebody else to close the kitchen 6 nights a week. I'm paid the same as a line cook, so that's what I'm going to do now.""

Time passes. I am back on the line, and he starts trying to bully the staff. I, as a former manager, know what is and isn't allowed by company policy. People start coming to me when they question his instructions, I tell them what the actual policy is, and what they can do to counter him. Chef, understandably, but most of the people we work with don't speak english too well, but stuff our company frowns upon. My outspoken defiance gets me transfered off the line and into the ""steward"" position. I don't care, plus I no longer work nights. Awesome. Angry that I haven't quit

First I've been a mod for something close to a year now. In that time KC has grown from a 2k plus subscriber base to a nearly 7k plus sub. On our current path

In March of last year we averaged something like 9k unique pageviews a month. Thanks to a KC post that frontpaged through /r/bestof, especially ones eager to post and comment, there are bound to be sudden shifts in the culture of the subreddit.

Cheffie and I have always had a handsoff approach to modding the sub. We do our best to keep posts out of the spam filter (and sometimes fail at that, simply because we are all so different in terms of what we do/did. 

One thing that will most likely be happening soon is the addition of another moderator. I'm also considering doing confirmed flair

Naturally anything is on the table

*Gluten-gate* is just part of the reason for the general feeling cooks, our clientele.  Some call it disdain or hatred...but it's really not.  It's more of a dull feeling of mistrust, ingrained in our core after years of dealing with the tiny fraction of you that have, at times, **single-handedly ruined our entire service**.   Like a stray cat that's been mistreated all of its life by the neighborhood kids...I flinch.

But those customers are only a tiny fraction!  Why would I feel this way everyday when such a small percentage cause problems?  Because I serve well over 300 people a day.  Some of my colleagues serve many times that.  Meaning on average the 0.5% of you come in **EVERY DAY**.  I know it's coming

At the same time though, ordering for them, hiring and training staff, executing and delivering the product you get on the table.  

**This shit is hard.**  It's hard even when things are going *well*.  I'm not sure if you can understand

So there I am

What happens?  It doesn't matter!  Could be anything.  We have all of these things going on and you (not really you) send in something altered or isn't on the menu.   

**Actually

The point is

But remember:  **I sincerely want you to be happy.**  These combined feelings result in an insane inner torment as I simultaneously curse your existence and rack my brain for how I can put a smile on your fat face.  

This is the thing that many people just don't get.  I know because people regularly ask if I or anyone I know has ever gotten pissed and spit in someone's food.

I guarantee the absolute last thing 99.9999% of our industry would do is sabotage your food.  It's our own product for fucks sake and anyone that is capable of doing so is weeded out by the job long before they get a chance.  We know that by all accounts we should want to ruin your day like you did ours

And that's why when people tell me or any of us that we should lighten up or treat our customers better

1363568781.0,1ahw3n,Relax...,WhosWhosWho,140,18,36,"We all have those seldom days where we are completely off from work, and even a bunny rabbit. Creepy as fuck


We went to a nice place; although for 30 dollars an entree I'd hope it would be. Normally I have issues going to other restaurants because all I can think about when I sit down is whats going on in the back. My girl is the same way



Anyway, steamed veg, and gnocchi. I ordered a braised lamb shank with roasted veg, and au gratin potatoes. We waited a decent amount, before we asked our waitress when the food was going to be served. They weren't busy, only three 2 tops, and a handful of 4 tops, we understood


Now, but broiled, tough and overcooked, my veg was poached in butter (Nothing wrong with that), and my potatoes were deep fried, and raw. My girlfriend's duck was grilled, and over cooked, and grill marks. Her veg was deep fried


So I ask the waitress if the kitchen was weeded out. She said has actually been slow, and I hear a very loud, very angry, and very annoying yell, ""That's how we serve it! If they don't like it then fuck them!"" 


I'm sort of disappointed, but truth in menu is a legal contract after all. So the waitress comes back out, almost in tears, and tells us that the kitchen would not be able to fix the problem...at which point the FOH manager comes up, and asks us what the problem was. I tell him, and then I ask, politely, which is understandable


So I ask to speak with the chef. Now my rainbows and butterflies are turning into dark clouds, and well...I promised to behave. He came out ready to fight, which caught me off guard a little bit, because Not only is this place not busy, but right now my girl and I are the only ones in the dining room. So I was confused as to were the hostility was coming from.



The chef was a skinny man, I tried to calm him down, and explain that I was also a chef, and although we weren't upset with the meal, we were upset that it was not what we had ordered. 


He then picks up my plate, let alone unprofessional. So I look at the FOH manager, and demand that I speak with the owner. This kid decides that the best course of action is to kick me and my girl out of his restaurant claiming they had the right to serve. I'm done with this kid, so I push him out of the way, and make my way to the kitchen. Turns out the oven was on death row, the kitchen was disgusting, and the line was in the back smoking weed and cigs. The lamb shanks were prefabricated, and all the duck in house was raw....they par cooked it in the fryer than finished on the grill. The veg was scattered all over the place: mostly on the floor. The dish pit was non functional


Again this kid claiming to be a chef is now just screaming at me, and an exec or a sous position is obviously too much for him right now. I tell him to relax, and find something more his speed. He doesn't listen and kicks me out of his restaurant by force (pushing, shoving, little love punches). I went back in shortly after, because the waitress still deserved her tip...it wasn't her fault the chef was a little shit.



I honestly felt bad for the kid, you just so happened to find me on a day off... And if you are reading this, I'm calling your owner as I'm typing this to tell him the state of your kitchen,and your level of skill and profession: if you still have a job after I talk to him, I'll also call the health dept...because my girl and I both got food poisoning. Find a better job suited for you...and relax...Why they hired a culinary student to be an exec is beyond me...you should be doing externships as a pantry boy, or dishwasher...



On the bright side

Chef is like, tell K how to do those shallots like you did the other night.""  So I'm like, word, just keep the fryer at around 220-240 so you get a light golden color and avoid the carryover that will turn them bitter.

So he starts the first load and checks to see if they're coming out right and I'm like, yeah but you could stand to drop a lot more in there at a time.  Five minutes later he's decided that it's taking too long and just starts putting them in the other fryer that I hadn't turned down from 375 and fairly mangles the entire batch.  I mean, they're not inedible but they're not right and there are a ton of burny bits.  So I'm like, all right, why don't you use these first?

Later in service I notice that he's serving his shit batch and I'm like, I don't know, I had them right here on the cutting board,"" and looks in the trash can and kind of shrugs.  I'm kind of baffled and go looking around and find them in the other trash can that he didn't inspect, and they are in there still in the quart containers.  I pull one out and I'm like ""Did you seriously just throw the shallots I made in the garbage?"" and he denies it.  Then like half an hour later out of nowhere he says ""Oh, yeah, I couldn't use those because they didn't have paprika on them.""    O_______________0

This is your friendly FOH bartender aka the woman who pours your shift drinks.  After seeing the recent Gluten-phobic table post and the ensuing chaos

&gt;What does it mean to “think about the guest”?  It means having cut/burned/scarred hands and forearms every day from cooking and prepping in a kitchen that can reach temperatures hot enough to seem like a living hell.

&gt;It means dissecting and mutilating a perfectly created dish to suit the special requests

&gt;That server that just fucked up ringing in 2 entrees on your 12 top?  (I know she told you it was the kitchens fault – they can't do anything right back there)  Yea

&gt;You know what's putting the guest first?  When my KM gets up from his freshly poured shifty because you just came and sat at my bar and you're famished.  No where else is open.  Guess what?  We're not either – but he'll cook you some wings or a sandwich if you like because he's here and you're hungry.

&gt;Hey, just in case one of those tickets is for an actual guest.  (It's not.)

&gt;Thinking about the guest is when everyone else gets sent home on a snowy night except the closing me and the owner. You're one of only 6 customers in the restaurant and we're definitely not making a profit at that point

&gt;Now, but what he REALLY means is medium well.  And that's ok! The grill-master will be happy to cook the perfectly prepared meaty goodness some more for you.  And as your server, I'm sorry again that it was “bloody.”  Why?  Because that's what it means to care about what the guest wants.  

&gt;After a 12 hour shift on the line churning out dish after dish of awesomely prepared and tasty food

&gt;But even after all that time and effort the guys and lady in the kitchen spent “thinking about the guest


And that really is the sad thing about it.  As much as customers can drive me completely fucking insane sometimes (especially the dozens of regulars who ALL think they're the most special) – sometimes the people who sit at my bar or at a table I'm serving really do make me enjoy my job.  As much as we ALL hate the people sometimes, let me just say thank you on behalf of all the friendly bartenders out front.  Imaginary drinks on me!

So a couple nights ago this guy broke into our building. We don't have a camera on the point of entry he used but

So at 4:45am the 20 year old naive dish guy shows up with our 22 year veteran line cook to open the place for breakfast. The cook goes into the office to get the notes from last night, at one point he looks at the prep list and lays back in the chair and stares at the ceiling without moving for 52 seconds (of course we timed it). So while he's fucking around in the office, the dishy walks up the line and sees the drunk guy playing the empty pots in the steam table like a set of bongos and walks by thinking ""Must be a new hire"" and even waves and says ""hey what up?"", walks right on by and continues going about his opening duties like nothing is up.

About 15 minutes later the cook comes out and sees some random shitfaced dude on the saute station with all 12 burners cranked high and a skillet on one of them while holding two handfuls of raw diced chicken. The cook asks him who he is and the guy explains that it's cool and that he knows the owner (he doesn't) while he's slowly dropping those chicken cubes as he talks. So the cook says ""Oh! Ok then, so he said ok, and went to the walk in to gather ingredients/call the cops. 

He then proceeds to sear a sirloin on the hot as fuck skillet and actually pour pancake batter on the motherfucker. He keeps talking the drunk guy up about how he's gonna ""get this motherfucker on the menu!"" He bullshits for another minute or so and the cops walk in the back and take the dumbass without a fight. (we're about 2 blocks from a police station in a small town so they get here fast).

So, and convinced me that this was not normal practice. I managed to get through to my area manager. She listened to me, and the next day I got to work and it seemed like she'd already got involved, though bizarrely not in the areas I'd highlighted. Every one seemed very angry that she had concerns about our food safety, and was doing things like checking we had correctly colour coded chopping boards, but no one mentioned the way we label the food. I kept quiet about what I'd told her.

Anyway, I sat down to ‘dutifully’ change the date labels, and then I thought back to what some of you guys had said.

I looked at myself, I'd already changed most of the labels by this point, but I resolved that next time they needed doing, I wouldn't.

Now, and the kitchen manager has been promoted and moved to a posher pub as assistant manager (would you believe it?). The culture of bad practice however has certainly remained, and the assistant managers and team leaders still enforce the label forging. However, we now have a new stand-in general manager.

At work today, I'd always assumed he was part of the dodgy system we have here. But I asked him for a word, and asked him if he knew ‘how the labelling works here’. He said he didn't, which surprised me, but I guess he hasn't taken much notice of the kitchen, despite us being currently without kitchen management. (Unless of course, as my partner has suggested

I told him what was going on, just to write it down for him.

I took that to heart. However, based on a mix of manufacturer's guidelines, company policy, and common sense. Part of the problem was that all food was having a 2 day label slapped on, regardless of how long it would actually keep. This meant, of course, that some food which has a shorter shelf life than 2 days was being served when it shouldn't, and goodness knows how many times before it was finally served. I made a list of all food and when it actually needed to be thrown away. Since I'd been on AFD for the last 3 days

The manager agreed to laminate and mount my new plan on the wall

Then

Now it is my goal to change the culture in my kitchen. There's one woman who has been working in the same kitchen for 15 years

I'm leaving this job soon, and introduce them to my new plan — most of them aren't actually careless; they've just had the same piss-poor training as me. And whenever a colleague goes to forge a label, I will call them out. I have 7 weeks to try to turn this around before I leave.

This has been a character-building day. It's possibly the first time in my adult working life that I've had to to show moral courage and do the right thing, and I thought I'd share it with the guys who inspired me to do it. Thanks.

But that's not it. There is an older guy who comes in 3-4 times/week at lunch and requests female servers. He touches their asses and sides

They fired our team leader server and all around great guy for touching someone's shoulder and leaning too close to them. But this old guy comes in 4 times a week and harasses our servers and the manager still joke around with him and buy him drinks occasionally.

I have worked there for 3 years and I am also considered senior as far as the servers go. I take huge sections, all that stuff. Someone called and said I was rude for saying I would bring a water pitcher right over but I forgot. I got a warning and if I get a second warning I get fired. The stories go on and on and everyone seems to be quitting.

But our GM is a great guy and he is just pressured by the corporate managers who make rules about taking the phone calls seriously, even other tables bothering them, our restaurant is giving out hundreds and hundreds of dollars of gift cards and free entrees. But they REFUSE to pay servers overtime (from 2.13 to 4.26/hr ON WEEKENDS and leave us short staffed). They don't stick up for us and fire the best team members for one customer complaint in 5 years. And they expect the best out of us with a high turnover and this corporate bullshit.

First

But the story goes as this. 
i have worked my way up the chain of command from salad bitch to exec chef in this small family owned restaurant. I've been through 5 other chefs and countless other employees. 
Until recently we have been doing very well and then my boss's wife was diagnosed with breast cancer last year. many trips and treatments later at Mayo clinic she was deemed cleaned this year in August. Only to have my boss need another knee replacement and could not work the hours he used to as bartender
During the last month a rather well to do gentleman has been visiting the restaurant rather frequently and so i found out today
As our lease contract is just about up
Hence

My boss then told me to go file for unemployment and he wouldnt deny the claim. Yay me. 

I have never seen the man cry before in all my time working there

i could use a cheering up KitchenConfidential

I have been working here for about 4 years now
We do mostly fine dining a la carte and weddings/conferences but every summer we open the front balcony up as a cafe to pull in the tourists.

For years we just did average cafe food, fish and chips all that crap. We would get so busy over summer and be so under prepared that almost every second table complained about their food. You knew you were sending out shit food but you could do nothing about it.

About 9 months ago the head chef got fired

The Head Chef and Food and Beverage manager convinced the owners to fork out $50
 I put myself in charge of music, low-fi beats and most importantly lots of Fela Kuti.

First day of the new bar and it is the week end of a music festival held in town,000 people, trail by fire. 
We took double the profit from the previous year and not one complaint about the food. 
After that it was steady all through summer

So now it's autumn,125 in the bar, the most we have made in one day since opening, whilst catering a 150 head wedding on a 37ºC/98ºF day with 2 qualified chefs and 2 apprentices.

Getting clocked out without your knowledge?

Not getting paid? 

Underage labor?

Dangerous conditions?

No holiday pay

These are some pretty basic worker's rights denied to restaurant workers. Do we put up with it because we are too drunk, and complacent from years of hearing ""this is how it is? or ""you just aren't tough enough for this industry? and ""you just need a thicker skin?"" 

Are we too broke to get lawyers

1355936920.0,154716,First Night Running The Kitchen,Soulbishop,70,13,15,"The Background info:

I have been working at this bistro by day wine bar by night place for about 2 years. I came in on the ground floor dish boy and pantry during the day. We eventually evolved into a wine bar with bistro style dishes and more. All of my experience up till the addition of night service had been under the owner (executive chef?) simple things like cooking pasta, very little cooking other than philly steaks, reuben sandwiches, and burgers. Well after some pleading and really putting my two jewels on the line; I negotiated a 30 day trial period where I would work doubles, day and night service and if I couldn't perform to par I would get my day shifts back if I hadn't been replaced.

My culinary training at this point was nil minus what I learned on the job, I live in central florida a lil backwoodsy area and came up in the ghetto for the most part so I had very lil exposure to gourmet/bistro food. The first Head/sous chef we had come in, had just finished a tour with the PGA tourney and taught me nothing more than to taste everything, he was very particular about his dish was his dish and no one could do it other than him. . . he ""had"" to leave within a week; ""it wasn't a right fit for him."" 

So now I'm under a 3 week deadline floundering; I need to say cooking, took me on every trip to local food distributors and my first trip to a whole foods. Meanwhile my day shift has been filled by a kid from Johnson and Wales. No Pressure right. Then the 4th week arrives and I'm given a simple task, make an app special. I pull panko crusted pan fried scallops out my ass, with creamy Jamaican sauce (I used a jerk blend my parents make at home). It sold out! The owner and her husband both made lil remarks as to that weekend being a test I got a decent raise and we sailed forward with the saute chef for a time approximately 9 months or so. During that time we added a fry station and one more body in the kitchen. We also trimmed and fluffed the menu and started 3 specials motif a catch, butchers, and pasta of the day, in addition to the regular menu. We even began doing monthly 5 course wine and beer dinners. But right before the saute left he made a comment as to me not loving cooking

So when our new and current chef got there I was a lil jaded 22 year old prick. But somehow he and our new pastry chef got through to me, and stuff that the other guys missed, like basic shit. Like the importance to being early, knowing how many covers are expected, how to use what we have in inventory to make profit, mise en place!!! How can you forget to teach that? Chef did alot to make me better even went to bat for me with the owner who wanted to look for other help. But he didn't tell me that till much later. So we plowed on till recently.

The Main point:
Our kitchen is a grill, 2 ovens, and salads on one side of the line and a fry station and pizza prep on the other side of the kitchen a bit convoluted I know and we have no pass to boot. I set up a tray jack and some trays and yell for pick up at the end of the line. There is only the two of us on the line me and chef. I work expo salads grill and part of saute, chef works saute and grills on his flat top; and ovens and ticket calls we split. We seat sixty in front of house and seat 50 in the backroom and we are mostly responsible for all catering food that goes out. We have 3rd guy on fry and pizza station but the pizzas cook in our ovens so yea. We had 4th guy hop on the line with us for a few weeks but he only slowed me and chef down. So as of late chef has been pushing me to come up with specials and has me penned for gastro cooking i guess is what its called, bridging flavors in weird ways he's really encouraging me to do more of it like pork medallions over risotto made with apple steeped veggie broth, and served with buttery sauteed apple chunks mixed in. 

Well last night he couldn’t make it to work because a family emergency, and Blackened Orange Citrus Mahi with a blood orange balsamic drizzle, both served with Sesame Honey Carrots. The whole thing went swimmingly! The fry station complimented me for handling the night so well the owner said I have come a long way from where I started. And chef called me late that nite after close as I am pulling into my parking spot to tell me he was proud and happy we were at the point as a brigade that a man down we still produced. I’m crying as I type this. I just wanted to share this with you guys cause I have had my doubts this whole time if I was making the cut or just about to get cut. I hope this encourages someone to stick with cooking.

TLDR; I have been slugging it out with my job to come up to the point where I can run the kitchen sans chef and last night I did and everyone acknowledged it.",self,t5_2sa8b,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/154716/first_night_running_the_kitchen/

Friday nights are the worst because I have to drive through downtown to get home. I end up going to this little Chinese restaurant and chill for a while by myself as traffic dies down.

The staff all know me there and I always order the same thing. However

Tonight, Orange Chicken, Chow Mein, and Beef and Broccoli. After taking their order, the server went in the back and the couple started arguing back and forth about something. The server came around and they called him back and asked what was in the Wor Won Ton soup. Basically they couldn't eat shrimp, and there were shrimp in their soup. Mind you, it hasn't been made yet. The server said it wasn't a problem and that their soup wouldn't have shrimp in it. The guy got mad and said ""look I don't want you picking shrimp out of the pot. I literally don't want it in the soup period, and the server walked away. The couple started arguing again and the guy gets up and walks to the kitchen, they order egg drop soup. Okay. The guy sits down and the server is about to walk away when the guy says ""oh and cancel the orange chicken."" The server double-checks that they still want their chow mein and beef and broccoli dish, and the guy gets up *again* to say that this has all been way too complicated and that they're leaving. The server says if they'll just be a bit patient their food will be right out. ""No

My best friends whom i graduated with work 45 hours a week, and truffles. Sounds great to the office worker who wants to be a cook, right? Until it's 1 am and you have 2 hours of breaking down your station and you have to be back at 7 am to make 10 gallons of hollandaise for lunch. 

Every idealistic vision I had of kitchens when I was in school and waiting tables was wrong. I idolized the cooks. I thought all I wanted to do was cook. And this was fine dining. We made composed plates with expensive ingredients. This was what every office worker foodie dreams of.

My rant of the week

3's been having big problems since they opened and seem to fire someone every 2 weeks.  I've had the same staff for almost 3 years.  We share a couple employees between restaurants and they needed Jaime (who works the 5 weekdays for Restaurant 1 and  Thursday-Saturday nights for Restaurant 3 ) to pick up Sunday nights as a kitchen manager.  They don't even respect him

They then decide they have no option but to fire him from both restaurants (severely fucking up my schedule).  I saved his ass by convincing my Sunday KM to move to restaurant 3 and my Sous to cover Sundays at Restaurant 1.  I had a verbal agreement that this would be temporary (3 months) until they found someone suited to run Sundays for them.  

5 months later and lots of emailing and stalling back and forth and the owners tell me that they're keeping him because they are still struggling to work the scheduling out over there and it'd be easier for me to just train someone new in.

I have a lot of loyal cooks who have stuck with me through lean years but noone else who can do the KM job correctly.  They expect me to hire someone brand new and promote him past all these people?  Rage coursing through my varicose veins right now....

Seriously. Clean the hot top, let it run, flip the door and pull the tray to air dry while everything's hot. Finding new things to do in that little window is a great way to pass the time and get your shit done.

So this is the 2.5 month update I guess. In my last two posts I hedged about revealing which restaurants I staged at but then I realized it's really not that big of a deal and besides

So far:

* Two weeks at Pied a Terre
* One month at Murano
* Two months and going at Viajante

I've also gone in once a week at a butcher's shop in Holborn. It's a traditional English place

I'm currently at Viajante and the butcher's

I feel like I'm accomplishing exactly what I hoped for. I've worked in kitchens since I was 16 (29 now) and always wondered what it was like in a Michelin kitchen and whether or not I could hack it. I'm confident enough to say that so far, be a maniac with the mise and make sure it never even makes it in. Obviously there's more to it than that but coming from a background where numbers and cover volume was a big issue, and lack of labor a significant factor in what could be accomplished, this is a different world. But it's not a different universe.

I feel privileged to say I learn something every day. It's a surprisingly nice feeling not to have the hammer down on you when you're at work. That's not to say I don't push as much as a guy who's getting paid, after a length of time has passed, that I know more about someone's station than another chef de partie - who might be responsible for something completely different - would know.

A significant concern of mine was getting put on onions or the equivalent all day. I don't mind, so I've gotten to do a lot of things. I was surprised and encouraged by how quickly I was allowed to plate at all three restaurants. I've even run a few stations, either out of necessity or, now, because they have enough confidence in me to do so - with supervision always hovering around the corner of course.

Techniques? Learning a lot of stuff. Simple things that never would have cropped up at the places I've worked for whatever reason, and could do a passable one, but when a Michelin star pastry section gets weeded there's still no room for a shitty quenelle and after just a single day of instruction mine are looking pretty cold blooded. I can crank them out fairly fast, but not nearly as fast as the chef de cuisine who is a total badass that can do two at a time perfectly. I had never used an immersion circulator. Agar clarification? Holy shit, so much better. The list goes on, and it's been something cool every day. There are also days where I shake my head and laugh a bit, like the difficulty a guy had poaching more than two eggs at a time. I understand they need to be perfect, the fryolator arts are a mysterious one for some of the guys and gals I've met. It's honestly shocked me how often I'll see someone try to ""dry"" fried food on a paper towel. But then I'll see the same guy absolutely destroy whole salmon in a matter of minutes

(I imagine this is what I must look like with chicken

My goal right now is to take a holiday in Portugal starting on the 8th, find a restaurant in Spain, Germany or a Scandinavian country to stage at until about March or April. If all goes well my budget should support me that far with enough to spare when I come back home to the states. By enough, I mean an amount that won't leave me living like a hobo. Well, maybe a well off hobo.

After that

Oh and another thing: BOH here gets paid holidays and tip money. Talk about a revelation.

I emailed the owner today and told him the story. He responded immediately thanking me for coming to him and promising to handle 'the situation'. He said the company in no way condones this sort of behavior



****edit take two!**** alright, so I went in through the back and avoided that. the story is that he was let go before dinner today after a meeting last night discussing what happened among the staff, many of whom came out with awkward or inappropriate encounters that they'd had with him. apparently other servers had decided to quit with me if he wasn't fired. he might work another couple shifts (without his manager privileges) while they work out his replacement, but never closing alone again, and no longer than a week. I spoke to the owner who wanted to make sure that I understood what was happening and that I was ok with the guy still being around. I said something along the lines of 'I ain't scared"", and that was that. got a lot of reassuring hugs from all my co-workers, rocked the Friday shift and made a bunch of money - life is good! thanks again,,1371885547.0,t3_1gqgb8

What I do not not not not love, and the second I try to run back and check, the reception starts cutting out and I have to hear the customer going 'oh um... hello? hello? are you there?' etc. 

And then, the conversations I have to have. We have our special order menu posted online. We have paper copies at the front of the restaurant. It's all very simple, and all the information is there. But whenever anybody calls, they want to be talked through this crap like it's a one-on-one extraspecial wedding cake consultation. 

ANYWAY MY QUESTION IS THIS: how can I possibly streamline this process? I'd like it to be entirely through email, prices laid out, couldn't be easier... how can I force these guys to check out the menu and not have to drop what I'm doing to talk on the phone. That is what I need to know. Imagine somebody saying the word 'cake' as slowly and tentatively and questioningly as possible 40 times a day over the phone until you hate the word and it no longer makes sense. 

The rest is an example of the conversations I have every day

""Hi! Oh! Um, your desserts are SO GOOD and I just KNEW I wanted a cake from you oh you will? You'll do it? Oh good!'

""what kind of cake do you want. shit! my marconas!""

""Um... what kind of cakes do you have?""

""we have... sigh... chocolate...? white? lemon

""Oh! oh carrot, haha, sorry, she's coming in on Friday? But we'd like the cake for Saturday. She loves your carrot cake. Can you make it vegan?""

""Yes.""

""If it's vegan will it be dry? We have 30 people coming and one is vegan

""It won't be dry

""Will it taste like a regular carrot cake?""

""I have 4 timers all going off at the same time and all the bread dough I have going back there is just rising out of control right now. It will taste good, and it's vegan.""

""Oh.""

""...""

""What about gluten free

""What? Um

""Can it be both? Will it be dry?""

""It will be different.""

""Ok

""k. vanilla frosting?""

""Oh

""no frosting?""

""we want it to be lighter

""a carrot cake with jam on it?""

""yes. do you think that'll be good?""

""... do... you?""

""I mean

""I think I would stick with frosting.""

""Could you frost it with ... the jam?""

""I... would recommend against doing that.""

Shit, they were all hanging out together, drunk as shit, dicking around, partying and such... And they were begging me to come back. Apparently their new lead cook is a piece of shit, their hours are harder, their ticket times are shit, I considered it. I even talked with the boss

That's what's so fucking crazy about this business. I could go back to a job where I'd be making a decent wage, and being shat on constantly, day in and day out. If it could be described as bitch work, it's my responsibility. I work pantry, and I feel like even if I kick ass, I consider myself lucky if I don't get bitched at for SOMETHING. Compliments or recognition are out of the fucking question.  

For context, by MY FUCKING SELF. Sure, I hated the world for awhile afterward. But you can't shake the badass feeling of, ""Fuck yeah, I just pulled that off""

Fast forward to where I am now, which is about 8 months. The other cooks hated my fucking guts when I first came here, because, I'll be honest, I had an ego. I was the lead cook at a big ass chain restaurant. I was trusted by the boss to be able to do the work of three cooks. I got more hours, and got higher pay. And that was because, unlike the other cooks

Three words... Superbowl. Sunday. Brunch. When both my prep-cook AND my fry-cook no-showed on me? Fuck that, it's a busy night? *LAUGH.* Give me your worst."" 

And there I stayed. That was my fucking problem, but that was just frying and grilling shit. Now, I'm preparing specifically prepared dishes a la minute, and plating them exactly how the chef wants. Fucking Christ that was an adjustment. I couldn't tell you how many dishes got sent back because they weren't pretty enough, and all the while I'm thinking, ""Shit, all I had to do before was cook shit

I've gotten better

I guess this turned into more of a drunken rant than a memoir... But eh... Fuck it

Edit: I guess the moral of the story is, and need to move your ass to something more challenging. The job I'm at now, I curse and bless it every day, because pretty much as soon as I become comfortable with my station, and my prep becomes routine, they change shit up on me.

The premise of my post was pretty simple - when making scrambled eggs, salt, pepper, with butter being used on the pan. I also argued that the only reason for the addition of milk was that milk is cheaper than eggs - evidenced by the fact that as far as I can tell, pre-depression era recipes do not include milk (or water, as used in the military and some modern recipes). Careme and and Escoffier do not include milk while it was readily available to them. 

So

&gt;Adding milk to eggs makes a world of difference. The reason for this is the same reason why Mayonnaise is made with BOILING HOT WATER. It doesn't take a genius to figure out why this is. If you genuinely believe that adding milk or water to eggs merely waters them down then I would have to assert that you are missing out on a quality plate of scrambled eggs. Please stop spreading your ignorance.

Chef de Cuisine (hereafter known as CdC) was given the restaurant week menu to develop and he had his name on it.  One of the items was a Paella which CdC was known for in town due to his previous position and he had a following

Little did I know CdC and Exec had been arguing for some time and things were not going well between then at that point.  So anyway, but he didn't fucking feel like it.  I know this is completely fucked, but what am I gonna say to the guy who threatened to fire me for not drinking with him all night?  This is where I begin to imagine the conversation with CdC the next day and start forming explanations.

So anyway, probably to blow lines, and drinking heavily on the line? 

So next day comes and I get there and CdC is standing by a prep table with a fish flat of fucked up rice FUMING.  Asks me what went on the night before.  I tell him the whole story:  record night, but I need to show you something"" and show him the knife.  At this point dude absolutely explodes, and he's like 6'5"", beefy, tattooed, into hardcore and shit.  Starts looking around the place for Exec, but exec is nowhere to be found.  Don't you know Exec LITERALLY AVOIDS THE RESTAURANT FOR DAYS BECAUSE HE KNOWS CDC IS GOING TO GIVE HIS NOTICE.  Finally I come in one day and one of the salad girls isn't there (usually two) and the one who showed up doesn't speak a lick of English and my Spanish is not so hot at the time.  Two other guys on the line didn't show and Chef de Cuisine makes his ultimatum:  if he didn't see Exec by 3:30, don't ya know 3:30 comes along and Chef de Cuisine walks the fuck out.

Aftermath:  Exec showed up but eventually disappeared during the rush and I ended up running the kitchen with two other people, big ups to those in FOH who have a heart and give a shit.  I put in my notice the next day because CdC was the only thing keeping me there.

1371409463.0,1ggv2f,O DEAR GOD HOW I HATE WORKING BRUNCH!!!,Derring-Do_Dan,53,9,35,"First of all I hate getting up early.  That's one reason I'm a cook in the first place.  Doesn't help that I close Saturday nights, to be at work by seven.  More often I'm up til two or later

If I'm lucky I won't have a fryer to clean, setting up isn't so bad.  I'm the only one here until a half hour before we open, unless the owner rolls through for a bit, but he never bugs me.

But then it starts.  We open at 10, cramped phone booth of a kitchen.  We have a six burner; in the back left corner is the poached egg pot, the other two burners have a range-top griddle for french toast and the like.  So I have three burners for shit like eggs and hash and so on and so forth. Which is just lovely when we keep getting big parties(in the context of where I work, that means 5 or more) who all want omelettes and hash and eggs and scrambles etc etc etc, and suddenly I need 15 burners and pans all at once.

Of course, we serve booze, and most people are content to have a drink or two and wait a little longer than they would at the local greasy spoon.  Our food is WAY better than that, and worth the wait.

The worst part tho is the servers.  We have, one server has been there longer than me and still doesn't know a damn thing about our menu.  Always forgets to ask what toast they want, always offers HF or fruit with dishes that don't get it, and keeps giving me tickets with items we don't have.  ""What do you mean we don't have feta?  Since when?""  ""Since TWO FUCKING YEARS AGO WHEN WE CHANGED THE MENU YOU STUPID FUCKING TWAT!!!""  And all it takes is one little screw up to monkeywrench the whole operation.

Plus they love to ticket-stack.  I have watched them, then take the ticket back behind the bar, rather than to the kitchen, so they can wait for more tables to order so they can run two or three tickets in at once.  So it might be ten or more minutes between order being taken and us seeing it in the kitchen.  Or they'll just ignore tables that are ready to order.  Of course, getting multiple tickets all at once is much more of a PITA than one at a time, but they don't give a damn how their actions affect the kitchen or their customers.  And then they have the nerve to complain about how long a ticket is taking, or why one ticket came out before the other one, plus we have no POS system

Then there's this crew of regulars, obnoxious, foul-mouthed bore.  He yells and curses and think's he's being the coolest guy in the room, completely oblivious to the other patrons who are trying to quietly enjoy a nice brunch.  And he loves to come up with crazy orders just to see if we can pull it off.  French dip panini with over easy eggs IN the panini?  Dick.  This stuff is really annoying from laypeople, it's infuriating coming from industry people who know better.  Lucky for me we see less of them lately due to golf season.

And then

So now I'm exhausted, and could cheerfully strangle most of our FOH crew.  With a smile on my face, whistling a jaunty tune.  The one thing that keeps me from exploding is, almost every time I come out of the kitchen, someone stops me to tell me how much they LOVED their food, how it was the best benny/omelette/whatever they've ever had.  Plus we got really good drinks when I get off at 2.

So that's my rant for the day

TL;DR: OP is a faggot

My restaurant recently opened a fast-food style fishbar to compliment our bit of the waterfront. The menu is simple- fried food and tacos on the grill. Most of the line guys cook there once a week for shits-and-giggles

It's worth noting that my place is casual-fine to exquisite-fine dining. The kind of place that accepts button-up shirts in the bar and requires guests to wear a jacket for dining room service. Most of the cooks here have been sous chefs or leads elsewhere

We like to call a shift at the fishbar ""Easy money"" even on high volume days- The menu is only 7 items long and none of us are new cooks.

Well the GM decided that, and it physically can't be done.

Don't get me wrong, even if it's just fry food.

The sous chef when I started left for a couple of years and came back about 12 months ago as a casual (mostly breakfast/conference food and prep work). A lot has changed since he left
Though I am an apprentice I am basically one step bellow the current sous chef as I know the menus and the kitchen back to front.
So the old sous chef has been giving me a lot of attitude over the last 6 months. Saying ""Yes Chef"" when I ask him to do something
During a wedding service one night I asked him to portion the balotine (he was standing around doing nothing 5 minutes before go time) he said ""I don't take orders from you"" 30 seconds later the head chef told him to portion the balotine.

Dear restaurant owners and operators, but let me tell you that a good ad is even more scarce. Here are a few pointers:

1. Include the name of your restaurant and its location. Most people want to know where they are applying to before they send out their resume

2. If you do not feel comfortable including your restaurant's name

3. Be descriptive. Don't post an ad that simply says ""busy restaurant in Prov seeks cook."" Tell me about your place

4. ""Seeking an individual with experience working grill, and garde manger. Must be able to work independently. Starting pay is $10/hr."" If you want quality help, then you're going to have to pay for it. 

5. While we're on the subject of money, or nonexistent. 

6. I can't pay my rent with valuable job experience, but I also love having a roof over my head and gas in my car. You are on glue if you think that any cook out there is passionate enough about cooking to disagree with me on those points. 

7. DO NOT POST AN AD WITH ALL CAPS AND NO PUNCTUATION IT WILL MAKE ME WONDER ABOUT THE MENTAL STATUS OF THE PERSON I COULD POTENTIALLY BE WORKING FOR AND I READ IT AS IF YOURE SHOUTING AT ME.

8. Seriously

9. Know the difference between a sous chef and a prep cook

1370851972.0,1g18tq,Dipping my toes into the kiddy pool,thrownawaydishes,47,12,29,"I was interested in working in the industry. I was just so curious how difficult it can be. How bad it can really be.

I walked into the local brewery and got a job as a dishwasher. Had two interviews, it's not gonna be that difficult"". By the end of the first day I was doing prep work as the prep cook filled in on the line. There was some talk of putting ME, the dishwasher, on the line because they were getting slammed (tourist season had just picked up that week). I eventually had to stop prepping the green beans and get back to washing dishes. 

The lunch rush ends, I was to work the night shift. I show up in the prep and dishwashing trailer to see the prep cook leaving. There was no prep/appetizer person to work with me. I had to make the pizza dough, salsa, dressings, roasted garlic, etc, prepare and run the appetizers out to the customers (all 200 of them)

The rush comes and I stay ontop of everything. The place was packed because there was a folk festival in town that weekend. Most of the diners are Texans with big appetites. They order everything on the menu and make a mess of whatever they eat. I get them there appetizers and clean their plates until the kitchen closes. That's where I get pissed off. I realize that the line is exhausting, but don't walk out on me the minute printer stops.

I do not know how to close up. The prep cook asked you guys to help me out and said that they would be around cleaning out their kitchen. It was pretty clear that they had to clean out their own kitchen, and figuring out how to clean out the fryer (I had some random server teach me how to do that). After I scrubbed everything in their kitchen and gathered the dishes into my kitchen to be cleaned I was exhausted. It was 11pm (kitchen closed at 9:15) and I had been running around like crazy since I showed up at noon. I was tired, hungry, and a little more tired. I had five piles at about shoulder height of dishes filled with everything needed to run a service. I just stared at it for a minute and decided that I did not want to do this.

For $7.00 an hour I was running three jobs with two days training on one job, ""Fuck this, I quit"" or ""This is bullshit, I quit"". That would portray me as scared and weak. I was thinking about making a list of reasons why this is ridiculous, but I didn't feel like explaining myself to them. I don't want them to know why I quit. I eventually went with:

"" *I QUIT*

*this is not worth minimum wage*

*don't call me

edit: to be accurate

There is a dude at my restaurant who does brunch. He is in his late sixties, grew up in the deep South as a black guy and spent time in prison for drug use and still carries the emotional baggage from those events. He also has to walk with a cane or supporting himself on surfaces like the stoves or counters due to chronic hip pain, and can't really bend over without a lot of pain. He is extremely short with waitstaff and has a history of abruptly ceasing communication with people for years at a time. He will decide one day that he doesn't like somebody and just stop talking to them. This includes not responding to direct questions like ""Hey, I'm placing an order with the fish company because I heard you say we were out of salmon. How much salmon should I order?"" and safety calls like 'behind you', 'corner', etc. The reasons he has for 'the silent treatment' run the gamut from 'I don't like that new manager, she looks like a girly-girl', to 'they taught the pastry chef to work the brunch station because I requested a day off

Pastry chef came on a year ago. She was hired to replace the former baker of 20 years as well as for her mixed experience with kitchen management, front of house and alternative diets. Once she got settled into the bakery, after a few months, she started suggesting changes. She noticed the chicken breasts we were selling for $5 were COSTING us almost $4.50 and we're now ordering some at less than a third of that cost. She noticed our lemonade, orange juice, chutney, flavor syrups, she is probably saving the restaurant close to 30, etc to go in a display case) in 6 hours and still have time to cost out the menu. 

The brunch fellow decided one day to stop talking to her, etc. This is driving her nuts, slowly, because she is the first recipient in close to 15 years of his 'silent treatments' to have to work in close proximity to him, in the kitchen. She feels her work is being actively devalued and that he is antagonizing her. We as a restaurant can tell that she is at the end of her rope with this guy, but we don't really fire people here, ever

What options is everybody left with?

Ok, but oh my gooooooood this guy has been buggin' me for almost a year now. He's run into me with hot trays so many times and the only reason it didn't burn me is because he's so damn slow that by the time he got to me they'd cooled a little.

Anyway

Not so long story short: not gonna happen.

So what now? I do some Google-fu. It yields a lot of hits, right? Just kidding. Sort of.

I end up visiting a cool little spot: tasting menu only, Michelin star and rising, etc. Except they're full on stages so they direct me next door, to the newly opened sister restaurant that does only small plates. The chef there instantly asks what I'm doing tomorrow night. My initial thought is, due to his eagerness/hopefullness, they are in the shits.

So I show up at the agreed time and, somehow pulling fish duty. Kinda. Not really fish duty but not the meat station either. Anyway I show up and they're like, ""Oh yeah, by the way, you'll be cooking these seven dishes tonight. We don't have any mise en place sheets, but you're prepped out,"" the last four words being the worst four words in the English language but these froggies don't give a fuck. Also when the chef told me the night before that everyone speaks English, but it's the way I speak Spanish. Which is to say

So that's it. When I ask, ""Night before our holidays man, we're empty, fuck yeah let's drink!"" but to him means ""We're full."" So yeah, there's that. Also, Saturday.

The whole time I'm trying to be a nice stage and keep asking anyone if they need help with their mise. Everyone seems to run out of stuff for me to do fairly quick

The first 30 minutes of service is predictably chaotic as they try to show me how to cook and plate these seven dishes as they're rung in

But everything got better. It was a lot of fun, oysters, squid, mushrooms and a carrot veloute; the only one that needed time was something called courge which was a kind of squash). After a while I forgot I was in Paris and just assembled my mise and added heat to things in the order the chef wanted it. That's it.

I got to work stations in London but obviously everyone - except maybe the Spanish guys - spoke English. It was pretty intimidating the first time but I got the hang of it. This was such a profoundly different experience. It could've gone tits up at any moment. I'm not saying this place was Michelin level, and the produce and ingredients are good. (And I got to learn techniques too, like how to open an oyster through the side and not at the hinge so you don't damage the belly. The chef used a turning knife and I imagine if I could see my face it would've been a gnarled up WTF expression but holy shit it works.) More importantly it reminded me that fundamentals see you through the day. If I hadn't shoved my nose into every nook and cranny trying to figure out what exactly was in my fridges before service I would've been such a burden mid-rush to my co-workers, who were also getting slammed. I got a couple of ""Don't worry, we'll help you during service"" answers during the day so of course the first thing I did was ignore them and exhaustively catalog what I could. I may not have the proper perspective on this because we of course drank afterwards aka an hour ago but one fundamental I stand behind is learning how to unfuck yourself.

Fast forward to now - place has unfortunately been a joke for awhile.  Food started off shit, owners have stopped showing up most days, usually only for a few hours around dinner time.  They put me on every day to open but just let me clock in as a bus boy (which I was alright with, they bumped my hourly a bit).  Mon-Sat I would open as bus boy, host, and functionally, manager.  I got manager pay only Sunday nights.  

Paychecks stopped coming on time about 3 months ago.  Suppliers stopped delivering except for COD around the same time.  Last month has been very depressing - numerous people have quit.  Bosses rarely come or call.  I finally took it upon myself to book all of our private parties as my bosses would never call them back if I passed it on to them.  I'm technically FOH, which is our main draw still.  Right after that, a call came in for a 30 person rez for brunch tomorrow, I figured this might be the end so I put her on hold and got the chef.  ""Sorry ma'am, we have a 600 person catering tomorrow so we need all the staff and will be closed.""  I knew that was it.  Chef looked at me as if to confirm - we were both okay with it.  Both frustrated with the direction the owners have led us.  Chef knows his cooking isn't up to par, also.  

Fast forward to my clock-out at 5pm today.  Owner shows up, admits I helped us carry on even when he was not present.  ""Not bad for your first time."" (He's been in the industry, for better or for worse, for about 40 years).  He said he'd send out an email at midnight tonight.  Until then, only myself, him , the chef and the GM knew.  

KC, even in as fucked up a place as I was in.  No regrets.  Going to enjoy my first Sunday off in nearly 2 years tomorrow.  Monday, time to find new work.

May I start by stating I was hired to bartend at a $$ family restaurant. I am actually a waitress. There is no management. Just the owner and his wife. He runs the kitchen, created the display, properly trained the staff, and created sidework sheets, and that was the biggest deal of them all. After all this, I have to deal with my tips being pooled with other servers who give bad to mediocre service on a slow night. It's been rough, but like I said

It's slowly dawned on me that one of the servers has been whispering in the owners wife's ear for quite a while. I believe she's responsible for 2other staff firings -- which did happen because of her hear-say. I also believe she's been stealing from the register we all use. 40-60 bucks a night. I don't like her. I don't hide it. I still give her tables refills. She tells the boss -get this- I've been ringing up drinks


I am the only positive face in that restaurant. I have worked 3 months with 6 off days. I do every job - bartend, bussing, dishwasher, and rarely cook. I am there every day. She was fired and rehired and now pushing the owners wife to make her GM. She couldn't make a kamikaze shot (she said she had been 'bartendering for years in a college town,' didn't know what an amaretto sour was, never completes her sidework (she hides it, actually)

I'm not a shmooser. I like to work hard. I can't afford NOT to work that double

End rant. Thank you. I can sleep now.

Edit :: I thought I was going to get fired because I overheard what she was saying to boss lady, boss lady said she needed to make schedule changes for next week because of 'waitress mistake,' and my boss lady has a certain look and acts a certain way when she's about to fire someone. Don't know if it matters, but it's an Asian style restaurant and the owners are Korean and very expressive.

Last Wednesday, this waitress decides to wait until 1045 to order her meal, after sitting around in an empty restaurant for 45 minutes and with full knowledge that we were closing down. Not just that, also a shift meal with several substitutions. Obviously, I was pissed, but made her meal. The pantry girl decided to call her out on the bullshit.

Now, I'll give her that, and this is her first kitchen job. But she is the fucking slowest at prepping her mise en place, slow during service, slow during closing. I usually close two stations and she closes her own. She can't follow directions or recipes, doesn't have common sense, poor math skills (multiplying recipes), horrible communication (never says ""behind"" or ""hot""), after no change

Anyways, after the server already has her meal, and tells her it's bullshit that she always orders so late and too cut that shit out. So the waitress runs to the owners and tells them what happened, so they come to the kitchen to see what the fuck happened. I was in charge (Chef's night off), and of course at this moment the pantry girl disappeared, so I discussed it with the owners. They said servers are free to order at any time the kitchen was open, and since we were still open, no one told the server we wouldn't make it

Fast forward to now. I get called into the office at the end of my shift. The owners explain that *obviously* things haven't been working out, and I reminded them that I said nothing to the server, and that I did nothing more than state my observations when asked about the situation. One of the owners said ""It's the story that wasn't being told that tells the whole story"". I don't even know what that means. I was dazed by the whole scenario so I just walked out. 

The chef followed me to my car and said that he had no control over it

I don't understand KC. What the fuck just happened? Did I really just get fired because of the pantry girl that I hate?

Edit: I texted with the chef and asked him to call me after the weekend and tell me the honest story of why I was let go. I told him that it's important to me for self development.

I'm young, not great, but my father decided it was the best place that wasn't a 45 minuet drive away), and was sitting at the bar in front of the open kitchen there. It's the same seat I've sat in umpteen times. I'm watching the cooks doing the same thing I've come to love, and remember seeing them when I was 5-6 years old doing it. I believe it was there that I first thought ""That's so cool! I want to do that some day!"" The thought was then misplaced, and filled in by the usual boyhood dreams (army man, cop, tractor driver), and reading culinary related books (guess who wrote them). Eventually, that permeate the field I realized that it was something I really wanted to do

About 3 months before I have to actually go to it I'm already setting it up. I first walk into a local gastropub in Winter Park, and still to this day I haven't gotten one back. Next place I go it one of the best establishments in town, on there corner of Park Ave. and New England. The bar is open, but they don't start the dinner service for another hour. I ask one of the girls standing behind the podium if I could speak with the manager. The manager come sour 5 minuets later and asks what's going on, and I tell him about the internship and how I'd like to spend those three days working there. He says that sounds more like a deal for the Chef de Cuisine, and that he'll send him right out. I'm standing there waiting (for only about 2 minuets) thinking it'll be some mid 30-something, clean cut, bearded

 I reply ""yes
""Well
""well sir.."" 
""Chef.""
 ""well chef, but I want to see what it's like to work in real kitchen."" 
""What days?""
 ""march 13th through the 15th."" 
""Do you have a chef's jacket?"" 
""no
""Okay, and give me a call. My cell number is on the card."" 
""yes chef."" 

I leave, I get my jacket, I get my mother's knife sharpened, and I get my biked fixed up so I can ride to work. I pop by the restaurant a few times for dinner and send Derek several texts to get info on what to do for the internship. 
Before I know it the day is upon me. I was told be in by noon. It's 11:15 and I walk through the back door into the kitchen, and sets me on my first job. Pizza sauce. From the moment on I barely stopped until 5 that afternoon for family meal. I stayed that night until 10:30 and rode my bike home. The next two days were about the same. However, on that final Friday Derek is talking bout the art festival the next day, and I j ump on the opportunity. I tell him that if he needs me I can come in. After a little back and forth I convince him. He says ""lunch starts at 11."" 
""I'll be in by 10:15."" 

9:55 that next morning I walk in and encounter two guys in the kitchen that I haven't met yet (due to their schedules), and drink and smoke my way home on my bike. 

A week or two goes by and I text Derek and let him know I can come in on my spring break. I intern all of my spring break (save the last weekend which was Easter

 May, two days on the clock and at least one more off of it. It's hard, dirty, and not always the nicest environment. But I tough it out, dealing with an asshole sous chef and an executive chef that can be even worse. But through all of it I still would wake up on days that I got to go in and was happy and proud of what I had. Eventually summer came to a close and it was back to school for my senior year. I didn't have as much time to work. But I still kept in touch with all the guys, and on breaks I'd go in.

Through the whole thing I was unsure of myself and if I was worthy enough of being proud. I was slow, even through all the shit they gave me and all the hard times. My friend replied with:

&gt;Jordan...it's part of the industry. we need to weed out the weak links and unsaturate our beautiful profession from all the bullshit artists and wannabes. And bring it back to the misfits the ones that belong in a world of hurt... Those that bleed and smile about it...the ones that give up everything in the name of love...and since people can't handle that devotion we chefs live alone and love what we do....chef life...chef love...chef.


That

I'm now headed off to college to get a degree in business before I go to culinary school. People have told me that I won't be making that much. I know, I don't want to do anything else. I love it. It's a rush like nothing else. It not going to be easy, and it won't always be fun. But those times when it is, and the satisfaction I'll get from serving people good food will make up for the crap. I just wanted to share this with r/kitchenconfidential, and see what you guys think.


P.S. Later in my college career I'll be picking up a job in a kitchen somewhere in town.

Our boss is constantly down our neck that we should prep faster. His goal times are way off though. His solution is not ""work faster"" or ""be more efficient"" but ""work sloppier"". He is chef/owner/manager and whenever he works in the kitchen he makes a mess. He is self taught and has never worked in a different kitchen. I feel he has no understanding that you have to put extra care into food to take it to the next level. Instead he is constantly looking to cut corners in order to save labour. When a recipe calls for diced peppers he tells us we should just roughly chop them
Yesterday was the worst so far, I feel embarrassed putting such food out. 

My problem is not only the difficulty to accept such bad practices, and now the boss came to me and said that he would prefer to train everybody himself so that they wouldn't be ""too precise"". The kicker: even if we would shave off five minutes labour every day by working shitty, we consistently waste time every day because he messed up the order and he has to drive to a shop or to our supplier to buy essential ingredients. Every single day.

I was tasked with making kielbasas to smoke tomorrow. I stuffed the casings fine and my first batch of 18 sausages came out fine. The second batch I decided to relax with my measuring of the sausages because I felt like I knew how long to make them. 1/2 of the sausages in the second batch were 1/4 - 1/2"" longer than the first batch. 18 sausages means I missed the equivalent of around 3 sausages which we could sell for around 6 dollars each.

We had the day cook, who was training a new employee, myself, the kitchen manager, peeing constantly from chugging water


Oh, one has pepper jack and jalepenos, one is ground in house corned beef with saurkraut and swiss inside, one is ground in house chicken/bacon with ham and swiss inside, and then we do one that's two portabella caps together with cheese inside and deep fried] which are 1lb each (two 6oz patties, and 4 oz of filling), made in house, from an awesome butcher, and the par is much higher on Mondays for them so yeah. Fucking busy ass shitty day. The icing on the cake was that I left before they made milkshakes for everyone out of some ice cream we were gonna toss because we needed the space more than it. Who doesn't love free milkshakes?

This ever happen to you?,rustyshacklefordsha,35,6,31,"  I got a part-time job at a restaurant/venue in Little Rock over the summer. It became apparent after only a few days that A) the kitchen was in severe disrepair and was not properly equipped to handle the summer heat and B) the head chef was a complete idiot who had never even heard of food sanitation. After less than three weeks of working there the walk-in cooler broke down.I noticed it was not as cool as it should have been at the end of my shift but assumed someone from management had already noticed it. Two days later I went back to work and realized that not only had no one noticed that everything in the cooler was room temperature, and then continue putting the chicken in containers for service. 
    Naturally, I had never seen anyone blatantly ignore rotting meat. I immediately brought this to the attention of the manager, who did a temp check on the walk-in. The walk-in cooler had been at over 60 degrees for two days. She said it was fine because the chicken containers, ""felt cool."" I then insisted that she smell the chicken. Despite the look of disgust on her face, she continued to insist that the chicken was fine and that I should get back to work. I insisted that we needed to call the owners if the head chef was serving rotten meat. She called the owners who told us to SERVE THE SPOILED CHICKEN ANYWAY. The head chef came out and talked to me. He became very defensive. I told him serving meat that had been above 40 degrees for days was a very easy way to harm one of the customers. He said he did not want to throw away that much chicken. Upon realizing what stupid fucks they were, I thanked them for the chance to work in their kitchen and left. I will never put profits above food sanitation. I will never stake my reputation on a dirty-ass kitchen with low standards. 
    Needless to say, but what else could I do? Has anyone else been in a situation like this? Were you able to solve the problem without quitting?

Bonus tidbit:
The owners of this establishment who insisted that we serve the bad chicken got food poisoning from eating at their own restaurant less than a week after I quit. Yay karma! Unfortunately

Edit: Nothing wrong with the French place. Cleanest kitchen I have ever worked in. Sorry for the confusion.


Update: Spoke to an employee who still worked at the restaurant after I left. Apparently after I walked out someone quickly realized the threat of me calling the health department and got the walk-in fixed immediately.

I am currently working at a restaurant that is unorthodox at best. I've made a few posts here, or cook perform. I watched a dish go out to the wrong table, watched a person eat from the plate, watched said plate go back into the kitchen, and instead of going in the trash, where it should have gone....the cook grabbed it, set back down on the line

I have worked in restaurants for a long time. I have worked in a lot of restaurants. I have bussed, prepped, cooked on multiple lines (from grill to fry) washed dishes, and bartended....I have never seen a cook do this to save face. 

Here are the details if you want them:

The place I work is small. There is no expo

   Every other restaurant I have worked in, when you get a ticket. When I ask the cooks (one doesn't speak enough English to speak to you to communicate effectively) about which plates are mine (I don't want to take the wrong dishes) he just yells some shit like ""you should know what the fuck you ordered,"" or, ""they're not my fucking tables,"" you get the idea. Makes it a little difficult, and the owner wonders why there are so many mix ups. 

There were 4 plates sitting in the window, and there is no excuse for the response I get when I ask, if the 2 grouped to the right are my table. I get a blank stare, like I asked a stupid question, ""yeah, that's your fuckin' table."" I throw the garnish on the plates and head out. I take it to the table, and go to ring up a glass of wine for the table. I hear I am ""needed"" in the kitchen.

""What the fuck man? why did you take that food? You mixed up the fucking dishes."" This is in front of a kitchen full of people

""Seriously? I say, so I took the food. Don't try to blame me, you didn't even put the ticket up."" 

The mistake was a simple one. Dish A: a seafood francese

dish b: veal francese with prosciutto under the veal

The portions are similar size and shape

I run out to get the food, and take the plate she tasted back to the kitchen. I'm about to toss the veal, and the cook grabs it from me, and sets it down in front of him on the line. I stand there with my mouth open. 
I walk out of the kitchen debating on whether or not tell the owner what is going on. I walk back in the kitchen

I have never seen anyone pull that shit. If I was cooking in the kitchen 

My last day is tomorrow. I can't work at a place where the kitchen guys don't give a fuck on that level. I watch the dishwasher take plates that are ""clean"" from tables, and instead of tossing the tiny amount dishboy puts in a tray for the line to use to season foods. They also keep saucepans full of food, and flour for dredging on the floor, and sometimes move them around with their feet.

On to the main point of posting. I implore you folks around the US and around the world to please, we truly do make most of them happy, so keep on doing that. Increasing happiness in this world is so underrated and helps people more than you would ever know. For those of you that want to do something a little more tangible, the best thing you can do is take the time to get yourself certified in CPR and basic first aid training, and ask your staff to do the same. For those of you cooking in big cities, and even small ones, the more people know how to properly help in these situations, a coworker, the better it is for everyone.

I started 7 years ago at the age of 14 in a greasy spoon diner. As a dishwasher. Got the job through my best friend, massive language barrier between myself and my fellow cooks (everyone else was Chinese with the exception of one Greek frycook, and not one of them spoke English well), and ""shitty hours"" (I've since learned that 5 day work weeks and closing at 9 pm was a cakewalk). During downtime the cooks would teach me about their native cuisines which created the spark that would eventually ignite my passion for all cuisines.

2 and a half years later, I only viewed it as temporary, I figured I would graduate and find a job outside of the industry and never have to look back. 

As school went on I started to become disillusioned with my grand plan. Despite doing well in my classes and maintaining a 3.8 GPA, a lot of luck, and a lot of money. It was at about this time that I discovered this subreddit, and Anthony Bourdain, David Cheng, and Thomas Keller among others, and it further opened my eyes to the industry. Reading of both the good and the bad made me realise fully just how much I love being in this industry and gave me a small window into the world beyond the low end bar and diner kitchens I had been in.

About a year and a half ago I found a new job at a local bar &amp; grill that pushed me over the edge. The menu was typical bar food

6 months ago everything finally clicked. I informed the university of my desire to leave (a few of my proffs tried to convince me to stay but ultimately understood my desire to leave)

Fast forward to now and I've recently found myself working for the most respected chef in the city at his newest restaurant. I'm currently on prep but I learn something new everyday and it is already a step of from the dish pit that I initially started in there. To top it off

Us guys who work nights and afternoons don't care about any of this shit. If we get 10 consecutive bills we just put our heads down and make the food. If a 6 or 8 top comes in with no warning or on one bill, so why fret over the little details? 

I don't understand why it's so difficult to do work without knowing every little detail about what's going on in the restaurant. I might ask for a menu count if we're ready to cut somebody just to make sure we don't get fucked over later... might. Stressing over all these things can't be good for you.

- Douchebag table of 9 whose reservation was at 5:30, got wasted, and were literally the last table to leave, five hours later. There's a reason we booked you at 5:30, so you WOULDN'T clog up the peak traffic!

**I quit my job this last week…**

For the last seven months I've been busting my ass in a restaurant that does degustation/tasting only and is run/own by two of the best Chefs in the city.  I'm talking Michelin caliber boys that have worked in Top 10 restaurants in the world and started a little restaurant of their own.    

In my time there I've gone from the cunt to pretty much running the kitchen.  I've worked the four sections (Pastry, organize the ordering and inventory, organize other jr. staff and try to liaise with FOH (including taking phone call reservations), fixed equipment, helped with small improvements over the food and menu creation and more.  Unofficially, I've been introduced to people as the Sous Chef and Chef de Cuisine but on paper/pay I'm just Chef de Partie.  For seven months I was working 5.5 days a week (5 days, 1 prep day) and clocking about 80 hours/week for $600. 

The two Chef owners can be nuts, sleeping until 5:00PM because they were out partying, leaving a mess after a night partying in their restaurant, etc.

Favourite moments of mine include:  

1. Having to break into the restaurant because I didn't have a key.  The Chef that lived above the restaurant left that morning because he was too embarrassed to face us when he was still drinking with friends at 10AM.  I climbed in through a window and told the two other cooks to climb in as well.  We couldn't get any orders into the building or FOH staff when we were opening for a busy lunch at 12.

2. I left behind an ordering list to be called through as I normally do with notes.  Showed up the next morning and nothing was ordered because the Chef went out and got shitfaced and forgot to call in the ordering.  

3. Being put on Sauce and never trained (I've only ever done Entremetier/Garnish with very minimal Sauce) and then yelled at for not being good enough.  Sauce at this place does all its own garnish/veg.  I had 2 hot mid courses, heat the puree, cook the baby corn in beurre monte/emulsion, get the poussin out of the circulator, pan roast the poussin, saute wild mushrooms, carve off the poussin breasts and warm the sauce. And I'm the cunt for taking too long…

4.  I don't have Michelin experience.  But every single Michelin stage we've had gets more attention and training than I do in one day.  ""Here

5. When the previous Saucier left I was working Garde.  In the two weeks that we didn't have anyone I prepped for two stations and had to make sure Sauce was fully set up for the Chef to walk onto the station at 6PM.  After service I'd also had to break down and clean when he walked off his station.  And I'm the cunt if I forgot to do something or don't have his backup ready.  Did I also mention we almost NEVER had a dishwasher.  So the cooks wash all their own dishes and pans.  I've had to scrub my own pots/pans to order before. 

What finally broke me down and got me to quit is after a night where I was left in charge they trashed their own restaurant with a party.  I ran service for a night expediting/plating and after we locked up for the night the Chefs came back with friends of theirs and had a booze &amp; blow fest.  I got a text message the next day at 7AM saying we were closed for lunch and to come at 1PM with a ""sorry for the mess"" at the end.  Walked into work at 12PM and the restaurant was destroyed, bottles everywhere, cigarette packs on the ground, food smashed/strewn all over.  We were left to clean it up and expect to be ready for dinner service while the two Chefs slept it off.  People walking by on the street were starring at us as we cleaned - it was one of the most embarrassing moments of my professional career.  

I quit that night.  We didn't an apology from them at all.  What kills me is that the service I ran for them was one of the smoothest and best services the restaurant had in a while (according to FOH management and staff).

The worse part of this is that I may have lost a sponsorship visa from them.  I'm working somewhere else in the world and they had originally agreed to sponsor me to stay on longer.  Although I'm starting to doubt they were serious.  We were talking about it for 4+ months and never saw one piece of paperwork be done.  I'm about to get deported in four months leaving behind a city I've grown to love with friends and a gf.

At the end of it all I feel so damn broken and like I was wrong to have quit.  Like I should have just sucked it up and not said anything.  Working my last two weeks was hard because I didn't even have faith or confidence in cooking anymore! The whole thing wants me to leave the kitchen where cooking has been the one thing I've ever been good at and done for the last 5 years.  I've always been the strongest cook that's held it together but at the end of this place I feel like a fucking loser.  I've never felt so kicked when I'm down...

Anyone have any advice or input? Anyone been through this before?

**TL;DR:** Was working my ass off.  Chef/Owners are douchebags and I quit but I feel like I'm in the wrong and broken and lost career wise.  ",self,t5_2sa8b,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/rh429/help_me_kc_im_so_lost_and_damn_confused_was_i/

1296503258.0,fckkw,"Just got an ""A"" on our health inspection.  Here are some thoughts on the subject...",Cheffie,25,0,14,"*I'm Executive Chef of a fine dining restaurant in nyc

Everyone with any restaurant experience knows that health inspections are extremely stressful.  During inspection

Last summer NYC changed its system from what was essentially pass/fail to a letter grade system: 0-13 points for an A, requiring monthly re-inspections until the point total falls below 28 or the restaurant is shut down by the city.  The point system, inspection procedure or regulations didn't change at all...what changed was the letter grading and the added rule that the it had to be posted ""where they can easily be seen by
people passing by.""

And it's a critical change at that.  For every restaurant in the city to be required to post a [giant letter grade](http://i.imgur.com/7kKRp.jpg) from the department of health on the front door is no joke.  I've always run a very clean kitchen...for the benefit of sanitation and of staff discipline.  Even I was fucking scared as hell.  

Why soil ourselves so badly?  

Well, someone else is doing the same.  So, for taco restaurants the competition went from all *restaurants serving tacos* to *restaurants serving tacos that have an ""A"" hanging on their door*.  The other places are irrelevant and cannot compete to make real money and/or survive until they achieve the ""A"".

New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene knows this and it is in fact the point of it all.  They’re working to make restaurants take their inspections  even more seriously or risk going out of business.   Which sounds great to just about everyone too.  But there are a couple of major problems here…

**1) The outcome of health inspections are often unpredictable and depend on a number of uncontrollable factors.**

This. Is. Fact. Ever been to the DMV?  Or the post office?  Or the police station?  I'm not trying say people in civil service are all terrible, helpful with addressing your concerns.  The next time you get someone who couldn't care less about you and doesn't mind letting you know it.  Or sometimes you get pulled over for speeding and the officer lets you go with a warning.  Other times he/she gives you the ticket while looking for reasons for more, giving you a condescending lecture the whole time.  Not sure why but people in civil service seem to be the most inconsistent workforce anywhere.  Maybe it's the hiring procedure, or the candidates they receive, or the nature of the job and their salaries?  Or maybe they're just as inconsistent as any other group, it's just that we expect them to be otherwise.

Well, but use common sense and reason to guide their process making them fair.  Some of them seem to be out to find every single violation or hint of one in an effort to inflict the most damage on your business during their visit.  Some of them don't really care about any of it and breeze through the inspection.  I guess they're human, and the worst of them are technically abiding by the rules stated.  So is the cop that adds on a ticket for not using the turn signal while pulling over.  Just saying that the inspector you draw is a huge factor that you have no control over.

Also, customers, garbage, chemicals, fire, water and anything else you can think of.  A restaurant is like a living being and to judge it based on a snapshot taken at a random moment is a problem itself.  Again, we got an ""A"" on our inspection, and of course we deal with them quickly to get everything soignee again. But should you be having a bad day and the inspector arrives

**2) People have no fucking clue what an A

Decisions that affect small businesses.  Small businesses that each employ anywhere from a handful to hundreds of people.  It's not hard to predict a diner's thought process in relation to health department letter grades.

**I'm only going to restaurants with an A!**

*Um

**I don't care!  A's are better than B's!  Everyone knows that from years and years of school!!  Why would I go somewhere that's not as good?**

And that diner is right.  There's no reason for anyone to go to any restaurant without that **A**.  On top of that, and proceeds to think about rat droppings, cockroaches, fight club, etc and runs away disgusted.

But do you know what makes a **B**?  Well we said already it's 14 points.  Points come from violations.  Some examples (each violation's point value has a range

Side towel left on counter top - **5 to 7 points**

Refrigerator above 41°F (even 1°) - **7 to 10 points**

Refrigerator missing thermometer - **2 to 5 points**

Any fly (*food and/or non-food areas*) - **5 to 8 points (28 if it's really messed up like Temple of Doom style I guess)**

Aaaaand we're at around 20 points!  Don't forget that these violations' points sometimes stack too. So for instance

The point is that the letter grade **doesn't actually mean anything close to what is being perceived.**  How about a 13 point **A** vs a 14 point **B**?  Or two **B**s but one had rotten meat on the hot line and the other got 6 points because a line cook was drinking a cup of water in the kitchen? (Yes

Here's [Grace Green on Huff Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/19/city-inspections-reveal-n_n_810872.html) with a typical clueless blog post.  She gleefully says that Le Cirque and Gramercy Tavern (large, and we don't know how many violations.  Again, you don't know because you can't tell because the letter grade doesn't have that information.  This is someone writing an article on the subject and still has no idea how the system works and what the grades mean.   The hilarious thing is that they don't mean anything until you investigate the violations.  (You can find full details on each restaurant's inspection [online](http://a816-restaurantinspection.nyc.gov/RestaurantInspection/SearchBrowse.do) but I seriously doubt anyone is going to bother to look past the letter grade)

And so these are the grades that everyone in the city are now judging us on.  And it's a shame.  I'm all for strict health and safety standards for diners and employees everywhere.  But the DHMH didn't think this through before implementation.  It's made slipping on a health code a potential death blow to an entire business and the income of its employees.  


**tl;dr Health inspection letter grades are too vague and arbitrary to have the so large an impact on a restaurant's ability to compete and survive.**

I would be fine with all of this, I'm in charge of all the accounting relating to the kitchen: labor and food cost being the big two.

This stupid thin application layer over a SQL database that made no sense.  I remember trying to add a new employee for the first time and spent a few minutes searching through the tabs to find the required field I hadn't filled in and it was selecting 'Restaurant' from the 'Revenue Department' pulldown menu that had only that one single selection.  It couldn't give you a prompt to indicate which field was missing?  Then there was what I called the ""Poison Table"" issue that manifested when a server messed up splitting items on a check for a large table.  Sometimes they would split an item twice and there would be a charge for 1/72th of an entree or whatever on each check.  Well the database object in their system was only built to handle 255 items on a table so when this happened and the server tried to close out the terminal crash and be inoperable for a few minutes while it rebooted and every time the icon for that table was punched it would crash AGAIN and have to be rebooted AGAIN and the problem could only be resolved by them reimaging the terminal remotely.  FUCK.

So tonight I just needed a Timecard Detail report and the GM has to look through a couple hundred employee names (most of whom are no longer with the company) not once but twice.  And there's no fucking search function.  There's a text field at the top of the window but it only displays the currently selected name and has no input function.  Fuck you micros.

So we've got two more reservations after this party so we're pretty much quarting everything up around 8:45 and preclosing.  We bang out the last couple tables who keep ordering apps for entrees to make sure the two of us are spread out over all of the four stations at the same time.

Then around 10 we are informed that we had a 10 top walking in, and we are about 30 seconds away from dropping meat in the pan when someone from the FOH comes up and says ""They're leaving, cancel the order!""  And they were serious.  Apparently it was somebody's 21st birthday and they asked the bartender about some esoteric cocktail with blackberries in it, the bartender told them that we didn't have any in house (which we did, our bartenders are idiots) and they decided that since they couldn't have their blackberry cocktail that the entire party of 11 wanted to cancel their order that had just printed out on our tickets and leave.  Probably about $700 worth of food that thankfully we hadn't quite started cooking yet because we were grabbing what we needed out of the walkin having been mostly broken down.

And after cancelling their entire order they took the time to take pictures of the entire group in the dining room before they left.  Gotta have material for the twitter.
