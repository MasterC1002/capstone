To make it easier for us to review your game please follow these guidelines:

* Suitable formats are [SGF](http://www.gokgs.com/archives.jsp) and [Eidogo](http://eidogo.com/) (or both).  
* Do not post photos or screen grabs unless absolutely necessary.
* Post as *self text*.  That way you have extra room to ask questions and provide the game link.
* Be sure to tell us which side you played (black or white) and your estimated rank.
* Please remove chat comments from the game record (unless they are directly related to the review).
* When possible take the time to do your own review before posting. Include variations and comments in the game record. We can use this information to give you a more accurate review of the game and your reasoning.
* You will get the most out of reviews of slow
* It's usually best to submit games that are close (win or lose) instead of lopsided games.

Tips:

* In Eidogo
* [How to delete variations in Eidogo](http://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/17t268/how_to_delete_a_variation_in_eidogo)
* [Tools for getting SGF files into Eidogo](http://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/16grbt/how_do_i_use_eidogo/c7vza83)

* Several different board/stone skins
* Replace/insert moves and rearrange the mainline variation...highly convenient when recording games
* Navigate mode where tapping the board navigates the game rather than playing stones

The craftsman isn’t ever following a single line of instruction. He’s making decisions as he goes along. For that reason he’ll be absorbed and attentive to what he’s doing even though he doesn’t deliberately contrive this. His motions and the machine are in a kind of harmony. He isn’t following any set of written instructions because the nature of the material at hand determines his thoughts and motions

This struck me as being relevant to the differences between strong and weak Go players. The weak player is thinking move by move

* Do some life and death problems. [goproblems.com](http://www.goproblems.com/) is a great resource. You don't have to do them all the time

Also

* Read other books too. Your library or your library's network might have copies of go books that you can take out if you'd like. Or you might be able to borrow them from a local Go club. Otherwise

These books will help you work on your strategy. After reading books, you should improve fast.

- The board is nice and responsive

- The sound of the stones is really satisfying.

- Some of the functionality is wonky or broken

The basic idea is that each person on the ladder has a rung #. Players start at the bottom and try to work up to rung #1. Each time you win a challenge match you swap rungs with your opponent above.

The specific instructions of how to join the ladder are covered in detail on the [ladder web page](http://rbaduk.tigerjump.net/).

The Challenge Ladder is now open for business!  To get things started I joined as the first rung :)  That's right

That means the earlier you get in the more games you will get as challengers appear from below!

In the spirit of /r/baduk I hope stronger players will be able to offer some game reviews as they move up the ladder. And I encourage all players to post interesting games back here in /r/baduk.  [EidoGo](http://eidogo.com/upload) is a good option for this.

EDIT: Shidogo's Q/A will be discontinued

----

Hello redditers, as my website is soon to expire!

Let me explain. Nearly 9 months ago I decided to take advantage of Stack Overflow's Stack Exchange system and create a Q/A website for players of the wonderful game of Go. I worked for several days straight putting together a Stack Exchange website and hacking around its limitations to let players easily post game boards using Eidogo's open source goodness. I had never been so passionate working on a project before; nothing else was more important at the moment.

Finally getting the site to an acceptable state, or if I was willing to sign an agreement saying I would never try to make money from the site.

Advertising? Profit? These were subjects that had not even crossed my mind. My intentions were to create a go-player-friendly website where questions would get answered, a product no one wanted.

But alas, determination.

I write to you all asking for your help to **let Shidogo live**. Today I received an email saying Shidogo will **expire next Monday**. However

Visiting the website today and seeing even a mere few users gave me hope

1: Even games only

2:Ranks to be altered retroactively during the tournament if it is obvious there has been a levelling up (or down!). This effects results somewhat

3: There were problems with non-responders staying in the tourny

4:Games left unplayed can actually be played at any time with the software I'm using

5: For clarity, and who won. E.G. Player A Vs Player B, player B won. It took ages to find the winner as I had to actually open the SGF files and look at the winner then cross-reference KGS names with Reddit user names. Obviously this led to some errors.

**FINALLY**: Programmar has come up with what I think is an awesome suggestion

**Copy paste below:
**
I would like to try an ongoing ladder tournament. I would be willing to administer the ladder if Hellzapoppin has time pressures or simply wants to focus on regular tournaments.

Games would be played on KGS using handicap
players can challenge an opponent 1 or 2 rungs above (negotiable)
challenges must be accepted (or forfeited) within 1 week
if the challenger wins they swap places on the ladder
the loser must challenge someone else before re-challenging the same opponent
a player can only issue one challenge at a time
new players start at the bottom of the ladder
I think the effect of this would be a ladder that strongly favours participation over rank. 

Of course playing well and winning games is still the mechanism for moving up so it also rewards effort.

The biggest issue is accuracy of ranks for determining the proper handicap.

Also

A slight modification would be to play one less than the normal handicap (unless already even). This would create a hybrid ordering on the ladder so it follows rank to some degree while still emphasizing participation and effort.",,t5_2qhqe,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/mxqoz/tournament_discussion_and_suggestions_thread/

That Said:

+ The tournament will use the McMahon pairing system.


+ If we have 40 or more players then we will split into bands


+ We will follow the Japanese rule set and counting system.


+ Even game


+ Games should take place on KGS in the Reddit room.


+ Time limit: 30 mins plus five 30 second byoyomi periods per player.


+ Rounds: We have enough entrants for 4 rounds


+ When to play:  You and your opponent shall decide the time of your game


+ No Shows: No game played will result in a void



+ Winners: The winner of the tournament is the player with the highest McMahon score; if this produces a tie, then the winner is the player with the highest sum of opponents' scores. Ties not resolved by any of these methods shall remain unresolved. I believe the program I'm using does this automatically, lets see how it pans out.


+ It is the duty of the winner of each game to report the result of the game. Report to me (Hellzapoppin) by PM on reddit. No game results will be a default void game.


+ Please report any disputes to me (Hellzapoppin) by PM on reddit


+ Prizes: For now, to be displayed next to the user that achieves that position.

+ Review: Multiple methods have been suggested

Note: The decisions I'm making are to try and keep the tournament simple and accommodate potential time zone differences


Please give me some feedback on this suggested rule set

Hello everyone !

I've mentioned previously in the very first posts about the reddit tournament that I was interested in doing group tsumego so I'm offering everyone just that ! I've never done that yet so think of it as an experiment. If it goes well

**What's that ?** If you don't know what tsumego are, well a bunch of people get together and try to solve a particular problem together.

**So, though.

**When is that?** Unless most interested members of r/baduk cannot attend, I'll post the SGF somewhere. Not as cool as the real thing, I know, but you'll still be able to see the attempts of everyone.

**How will it work** For the exact details, I'll keep you guys updated.

**How do I join?** Anyone can join but as I mentioned anyone in the SDK or higher range will find this boring beyond hope. If you plan on being there

[http://eidogo.com/#30KzF4ZJ:0

Some background on the *jubango*:  We have only played this one game so far

* All games played using AGA ruleset;
* No *komi* (compensation points);
* Four hours of main time and ten periods of one-minute *byo-yomi* per player;
* Players begin alternatingly taking black and white
* When one player drops to four losses below the other
* Handicap levels are:
  * (1) Alternating black and white
  * (2) Black for all games
  * (3) Two-stone handicap for all games.

As you can see the rules allow for quite a lot of time -- and actually this game was played over 4 sessions totalling about 10 hours!  Also:  it is traditional for *jubango* games to be played with no *komi*, in tennis.

My opponent won the *nigiri*, which was made worse after an important opening mistake.  After that, I managed to hang tough and punish a few of his mistakes in the middlegame, bringing the game back to roughly even, and in the early endgame I pulled ahead by enough to force a desperate invasion and resignation.  The lesson for the game is:  Go is an endurance game, whoever makes the fewest mistakes over the course of the whole game wins, so never give up as long as the possibility of your opponent making mistakes remains -- there is still an opportunity to punish and make a comeback! ;)

Obviously there are many more possible constraints, I don't want my playstyle to be too rigid, but I feel as though I'm coming to understand how, for instance, those ancient Houses of Go used to have ""secret moves"" - certain beneficial shapes have made themselves known to me, and when I start to make those shapes a priority, my chances of victory increase.

However the Kingkiller Chronicles series by Patrick Rothfuss is the best fantasy I read in a long time. The first part ""The Name of the Wind"" was awesome and the second part just came out a little more than a week ago.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wise_Man's_Fear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wise_Man's_Fear)

I am about halfway through it and the main character is visiting the court of a foreign king. There he learns to play the game of tak from a somewhat mysterious nobleman. That game might very well be go or the author was inspired by go.

The rules are not explicitly mentioned but through anything I have learned it could hardly be anything else:

* The rules are very simple to learn
* Pretty soon they don't carry the playing equipment back and forth because the board seems to be big ;)
* They play with stones not any kind of special pieces
* They talk about sequences of moves in a corner and the teacher has a name for this sequence (not an actual name for a joseki or tesuji).
* After a while Kvothe thinks he has it all figured out
* The teacher says it is not about winning. Quote from the book: ""The point is to play a beautiful game. Why would I want to win anything other than a beautiful game?""

I might add more as I read on... anyhow I think the author captured the spirit of the game quite beautifully. Is he an AGA member or known go player? Anyone else read this?

Here are the rules for those who missed the first game post:

* All games played using AGA ruleset;
* White starts with 1 point of *komi* (compensation points);
    * This was 0 points for game 1
* Four hours of main time and ten periods of one-minute *byo-yomi* per player;
* Players begin alternatingly taking black and white
* When one player drops to four losses below the other
* Handicap levels are:

    * (1) Alternating black and white
    * (2) Black for all games
    * (3) Two-stone handicap for all games.

I won the first game, and since we spent a lot of time playing these games and thinking deeply about each move.  Even though there are still mistakes, there aren't really any ""misreads"" or mistakes due to moving too quickly -- I assure you they are interesting, quality games!

&gt; Couldn't find a way to delete any trees in eidogo

It took me a long time to figure out how to delete variations in Eidogo and I'm guessing the solution may not be well known.

Actually there is no ""button"" to delete a sub-tree.  However Eidogo will prompt you to do so if you remove all ""properties"" from a position.

In practical terms this means:

1. ""Edit Comment"" and delete all text 
2. use ""Clear Marker"" to remove Letter and Number marks
3. remove the actual stone (using ""Black Stone"" or ""White Stone"")
4. click OK on the ""Delete Position"" dialog box
5. click ""Save to Server""

Step 5 is important because the game tree display doesn't auto-refresh.

When you mark dead stones, but if he were to capture them like normal would he not have gotten less territory? 
He would capture the 2 stones but he would lose 1 territory from where he placed the last stone in the surround? This is only a problem with Japanese scoring rules?

Also, but will it never be worth it, just to make the other player place a lot of stones in his own territory to capture you? Will he always come out ahead even if he captures a few stones? if he needs 6 stones to capture my 2 stones would I not get ahead? If it was in his territory
Sure I lose 2 stones but he loses 6 territories? I guess this only matter with Japanese rules like the other case.

I was tolled Japanese scoring rules and Chinese scoring rules would always get the same game result
