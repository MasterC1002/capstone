1371192580.0,1gbp63,YSK that on Tuesday a judge confirmed what intern advocates have been alleging for years: a lot of upaid intership programs are illegal.,God_Wills_It_,5613,2980,480,"Unpaid internships* are increasingly a fact of life for college students. The National Association of Colleges and Employers found that 55 percent of the class of 2012 had an internship or co-op during their time in college. Almost half of those — 47 percent — were unpaid. A third of internships at for-profit companies were unpaid.

Depending on how you look at it

But whatever your moral leanings

Judge William Pauley, and that those interns can file a class action against the studio. He concluded:

They worked as paid employees work

The tests being hinted at there — of whether an internship provides valuable training and whether it benefits the firm or the intern more — reflect the reasoning of a 2010 fact sheet put out by the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Divison

1.The internship

2.The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern;

3.The intern does not displace regular employees

4.The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded;

5.The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship; and

6.The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship.

Pauley cites that fact sheet, effectively, as a binding interpretation of federal law around internships.

Some employment attorneys think that move is a mistake. “You’ve got to consider a lot of different factors including these six factors

A better analysis, a case in which Wang, a former unpaid intern at Harper’s Bazaar, tried to put together a class action on behalf of the Heart Corporation’s unpaid interns. The judge in that case, Harold Baer (also of the Southern District of New York), didn’t discount the six-factors in the fact sheet — “After all,” he writes

Baer ruled that Wang couldn’t file a class action, unlike Pauley, he declined to rule, without a trial, that Wang and her prospective co-plaintiffs were employees covered by minimum wage and overtime laws.

The trial has been adjourned indefinitely, which also represents the interns in the Fox case, confirms that they’re planning on going forward with a jury trial. All of which reinforces Olson’s point that Pauley is just just one judge, in just one district, and it’s hard to predict what appeals court judges will rule on any of these cases.

As you can imagine, author of “Intern Nation” and a critic of unpaid internships, says. That includes, he continues, the reasoning that for-profit companies’ interns are employees entitled to back pay, and that they constitute a class that can file a class action suit.

They also differ on which kinds of firms are breaking these laws. Perlin argues that even non-profit firms — which are allowed to have unpaid “volunteers” — are likely in violation of the law if they have actual unpaid interns. “Just because you’re working for somebody who’s been classified as a 501(c)3 doesn’t mean you don’t have to treat them like workers, “Interns would have the burden of proving they’re not volunteers. Somebody is going to have to step up and make the case.” A logical place to start, he says, would be D.C. “Congress has exempted its own interns from fair labor standards act,” he says. “That’s something waiting to be addressed.”

Olson thinks that’s far-fetched. “We’ve had volunteers at hospitals and not-for-profits that are performing responsibilities, but I don’t think there’s a strong argument to be made there.”

But the two agree that there are many for-profit companies currently in violation of the law, because they don’t want to run the risk that there’s not enough benefit for the worker,” she says. “Of the ones that do offer internships, many have revised them so they are paying minimum wage.”

That’s largely an effect of media scrutiny,” she says. “And that’s a really good thing.” That could be the most important way that cases like this change things. Neither Olson nor Perlin have noticed the Department of Labor stepping up enforcement lately, and lawsuits are a rather expensive and time-consuming way to protect your rights. Olson notes that some settlements in these cases have been as paltry as $1,100.

She advises interns who think their companies are running afoul of the law to talk to their human resources department, and whether the company is violating those rules. Potentially the matter could be resolved without the cost of a lawyer.

Of course, and the $0 in future compensation that you could have gotten from it. And if the reputational cost of being fired from the internship is too great to bear, then legal recourse is still available. Unpaid interns have nothing to lose but their chains.

\* Full disclosure: I’ve had three unpaid summer internships in my life

Update: The first version of this article said 52 percent of the class of 2012 had internships or co-op experiments in college. The actual number is 55 percent. We regret the error.

First, what it implies, or a SCOTUS case. 

So this post is going to be split into rights and privileges, so you need to read your state constitutions to find out if there's anything that goes past the federal constitution. Remember that we are 50 semi-sovereign states united, not a unitary government. 

###**Rights**

1) Some states require that you identify yourself, don't be a dick. At finish your conversation and move on. Do *not* become hostile just because someone stopped you. 

2) You have the right to refuse a search of yourself, then your car, then you. 

3) If you are arrested

4) You invoke the right to silence by explicitly stating what you're doing. 

5) If you're a photographer like me

###**Rights Subsequently Granted by SCOTUS**

**1959**

- *Bartkus v. Illinois* = Crimes that are tried in state court *and* in federal court do not violate Dual Jeopardy Clause due to the doctrine of dual sovereignty.

**1963**

- *Gideon v. Wainright* = All indigent persons must be given an attorney at the state's expense. 

**1966** 

- *Miranda v. Arizona* = Law enforcement required to inform suspect of right to remain silent and right to counsel.

**1984**

In my opinion

- *Nix v. Williams* = Inevitable discovery exception to exclusionary rule. Police may introduce unconstitutionally discovered evidence at trial if they can prove that they would have found the evidence anyway through constitutional means. 

**1987**

- *Arizona v. Hicks* = Established plain view doctrine. Irrelevant evidence in plain view may be legally gathered. 

**1990**

- *Horton v. California* = Expands the in plain view doctrine by removing the requirement that evidence was *inadvertently* discovered. 

**1998**

- *Knowles v. Iowa* Automobiles can not be searched on routine traffic stops because it counts as unreasonable search and seizure. 

**1999**

- *Wyoming v. Houghton* Police may search the belongings of all passengers in the car when lawfully seeking evidence against the driver. 

You are going to get in trouble if someone is doing something illegal in your car while you are driving. 

**2010**

- *Berghuis v. Thompkins* = Suspect's silence does not itself invoke right to silence. Suspect must explicitly state invocation of the right

###**Privileges**

- You *generally* have the right to photograph anything in plain view. People do not have a right to privacy when they're in public and that includes law enforcement. Exceptions are shooting into homes and on private property

- You *generally* have the right to not identify yourself to a police officer who does not suspect you of anything. 24 states have stop-and-identify laws. 

- You *generally* have the right to record what happens. 38 states are one-party-consent states. ",,t5_2r94o,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/1htgsr/ysk_your_actual_basic_rights_when_dealing_with/

1360074489.0,17xllp,YSK how to win at Scrabble.,richarizard,3471,1328,236,"After reading batgirl289’s awesome [summary on proper Monopoloy strategy](http://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/167x1g/ysk_how_to_win_at_monopoly/), the tiles aren’t everything.

Before I discuss strategy though, called (appropriately enough) the Tournament Word List (TWL). It’s the most recent edition of the *Official Scrabble Player’s Dictionary* with three important changes: (1) offensive words are included; (2) words with roots over 8 letters are added; and (3) definitions are removed (to save space). That’s the authority. If you play a word in the TWL, it’s valid. If your word isn’t in the TWL, it’s invalid. Although some players use word meanings as a memorization aid, no serious players remember all (or even most) of them. Nor are players particularly concerned with why such-and-such word is included or left out. You’ve gotta draw the line somewhere. With that said, here are a few general tips to up your Scrabble game.


**1. Know your 2-letter words.**

This *alone* boosts your average score by about 50 points and puts you at an enormous advantage against someone who doesn’t know the 2s. Knowing these words basically makes parallel plays--playing a word parallel to another word, this is probably more important than the rest of my tips combined.

**2. Stop playing defensively.**

How many times have you seen an awesome opening--an easy link to a triple word score, you’re actually hurting your score. Blocking a good opening not only stops your opponent from playing there, it also stops *you* from playing there in case your opponent can’t. This effect is compounded further if your opponent is good. Good players can work with whatever board they have, meaning the *only* person you’re blocking is yourself. Generally speaking, if you have a better move (worth at least around 8 more points), go for it.

**3. Save up for bingos.**

I’m always surprised when a casual player doesn’t realize there’s a 50-point incentive for using all of your tiles at once (called a bingo). That’s a lot of points. I’ve played a lot of games that essentially boiled down to who got the most bingos. The most valuable tiles for getting bingos are, S, and E. Think at least one move ahead! Whenever you make a move, pay equal attention to what tiles you leave behind. There’s a general rule of thumb, in fact. Don’t play an S unless the move you’re thinking of beats your next-best move by at least 8 points. And don’t use the blank unless it beats your next-best move by at least *20* points. Save them for bingos.

Here’s an example. Let’s say you have the rack AEIKRST. What words do you think you’d play? A lot of casual players would go for RAKES or SKATE, you’re actually hurting yourself! Look how awesome your letters are, aside from that pesky K. With no other information, I’d suggest just trying to get rid of the K or maybe playing one of the 2-letter words KI or KA (if you know your 2s) and keeping the rest. Let’s say you just play the K and draw a D. Do you see a common bingo in ADEIRST? (Answers at end.)

The single biggest thing that drives me nuts when playing against a casual opponent? When they use the blank for anything less than a 40- or 50-point word. It’s actually a little unusual for a competitive player to use a blank on something other than a bingo. Consider the rack AEIRST plus one blank. Do you see a common bingo there? (Answers at end.)

**4. Look for prefixes and suffixes.**

The act of actually moving tiles around, top-tier Scrabblers included. (Although at certain level, this strategy becomes a bit more nuanced.) Move RE or UN to the beginning of your rack. Or move ING or ED to the end. Even though it doesn’t seem like a huge difference, juggling 4 or 5 tiles in your head is *worlds* easier than juggling all 7. This is how you’ll find most bingos. To see what I mean, try and find the words in these letters. Watch what happens if you isolate common prefixes and suffixes: EINSWU, CEINORS, DEENSU. (Answers at end.)

**5. Treat your Q like the plague.**

Don’t let the ‘10’ on it deceive you. It’s one of the worst tiles. Probably *the* worst. It can outright cost you a game if you don’t draw it until the end. Having an additional U upgrades it from plague to minor cold, QADI, QANAT, SUQ, QUA, and so on. It’s a list worth memorizing, albeit not as game-changing as the 2-letter words.

One final note: an English degree doesn’t really help you at all. There are roughly 180,000 of them. Think about that: Over 80 percent of the acceptable words in Scrabble mean nothing to you. Moreover, consider what words are most useful in Scrabble. Words with lots of vowels (AALII, ILIA, URAEI). Seven- and eight-letter bingos with lots of common letters (ANESTRI, SEROTINE, AUDIENT). Words that help you dump an excess number of a particular tile (NINON, ABAYA). Words that hook on to common words (SPIRATE

Answers:

1. There are actually 8 valid bingos with ADEIRST. Here they are in approximate order of commonness: TIRADES, TARDIES (‘tardy’ can be a noun), STAIDER (more staid), DISRATE (to lower a rating), DIASTER (a stage in mitosis).
2. There are 70(!) valid bingos with ?AEIRST. (The blank is usually represented with a question mark.) I can’t speak to how many of them you know, SALTIER, TRIAGES, RETAILS, ATTIRES, and NASTIER, to name a few.

    As I have gone alone in there

    And with my treasures bold

    I can keep my secret where

    And hint of riches new and old.

    Begin it where warm waters halt

    And take it in the canyon down

    Not far

    Put in below the home of Brown.

    From there it’s no place for the meek

    The end is drawing ever nigh;

    There’ll be no paddle up your creek

    Just heavy loads and water high.

    If you’ve been wise and found the blaze

    Look quickly down

    But tarry scant with marvel gaze

    Just take the chest and go in peace.

    So why is it that I must go

    And leave my trove for all to seek?

    The answers I already know

    I’ve done it tired

    So hear me all and listen good

    Your effort will be worth the cold.

    If you are brave and in the wood

    I give you title to the gold.

* You wash your hands and dry them.

* You pick up a handful of meat

* You DO NOT smash the meat up and form it into a pretty ball and then shape it in to a pretty perfect patty.

* The more you handle the meat the more tough and not delicious your burger will be.  

** DO NOT MAN HANDLE THE MEAT!  **

* You take the handful of meat and you slap it between two hands like a meat high five so it is 1/2 inch thick.

* You do not make it pretty.  You do not handle the meat. 

* You sprinkle some salt and pepper on both sides and slap it on a hot grill

** DO NOT SMOOSH DOWN THE BURGERS WHILE THEY ARE COOKING FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY! **

Let us imagine a town with 1million inhabitants. 100 of those are dangerous terrorists. Fortunately

Citizen K is scanned, you have just committed the base-rate fallacy. Look:

In this town of 1million,999 of the remaining 999,900 citizens.  This gives us 10,998 people loaded onto a bus to Guantanamo, of which only 99 are actually terrorists, or roughly 1%.

Boring numbers aside, especially when collected en masse. Noise (useless data) can be incorrectly identified as signal when not properly studied.

1357694562.0,167x1g,YSK How to win at Monopoly,batgirl289,3484,1568,532,"I notice that every time something related to Monopoly hits the front page, they tend to be exciting and I nearly always win. Here's how to win at Monopoly.

[Here's the board for reference.](http://i.imgur.com/VMSlO.jpg)


##Which properties you should buy:

Nearly all of them. Seriously. Try to get as many properties as you can. The money they cost is worth considerably less than how much value you'll get out of them. If you offer a person $100 or Oriental Avenue in a trade, acquiring a specific property is rather difficult.

However, and you've now paid 50 dollars to make sure you don't have to pay up to 120 dollars to someone else later on. You can also use this card for trades if you'd like, although they aren't as useful as other properties for this.

You're also not going to win the game through the railroads. However, you may want to secure one of the railroads for yourself.

##Properties to invest in:

Every property on the first half of the board (in between Go and Free Parking) is very useful. They are often ignored by inexperienced players

Houses in the first half of the board go from only 50-100 dollars. That means that to get hotels on all of the light blue properties

Compare that to the red properties. Buying houses with 750 dollars for the reds will only  net you 5 measly houses. That means the most you can hope to reap in rent is 300. And with the higher price of acquiring all the red properties

Reds and greens and other properties on the other side of the board are good for one reason

##Gameplay:

You need to acquire a monopoly as soon as possible, and invest in some houses/hotels. Leave only about 100 dollars saved for emergencies (rent, luxury taxes, etc). The only thing that can screw you up now is if you're extremely unfortunate enough to get the property repairs tax card before anyone lands on your properties and you have nothing left to mortgage. Luckily, this rarely happens.

##Properties in order of importance:

1. Orange properties. Because of their positions on the board

2. Light blues. Hotels are the cheapest in the game and people are very likely to land on these properties

3. Pink properties

4. Red properties. Nice for trading purposes. Do not put houses on them except as a last resort

5. Purples. You're not going to bankrupt anyone with these

6. Yellows. Same rules as the red cards.

7. Railroads.


8. Greens and Navy blues. The only times I've ever put hotels on them was to speed up an imminent victory. It's simply too hard to win if you rely on *only* these monopolies.

9. Utilities

tl;dr: Get as many properties as you can. Invest houses/hotels in monopolies on the first half of the board (especially the oranges and light blues)

Hope this helps!

[A study conducted published in the British Medical Journal](http://www.bmj.com/content/332/7536/266)


**Abstract**

**Objective** To assess the effects of didgeridoo playing on daytime sleepiness and other outcomes related to sleep by reducing collapsibility of the upper airways in patients with moderate obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome and snoring.

**Design** Randomised controlled trial.

**Setting** Private practice of a didgeridoo instructor and a single centre for sleep medicine.

**Participants** 25 patients aged &gt; 18 years with an apnoea-hypopnoea index between 15 and 30 and who complained about snoring.

**Interventions** Didgeridoo lessons and daily practice at home with standardised instruments for four months. Participants in the control group remained on the waiting list for lessons.

**Main outcome measure** Daytime sleepiness (Epworth scale from 0 (no daytime sleepiness) to 24), apnoea-hypopnoea index, and health related quality of life (SF-36).

**Results** Participants in the didgeridoo group practised an average of 5.9 days a week (SD 0.86) for 25.3 minutes (SD 3.4). Compared with the control group in the didgeridoo group daytime sleepiness (difference −3.0, −12.3 to −0.1, P = 0.05) improved significantly and partners reported less sleep disturbance (difference −2.8, −4.7 to −0.9, P &lt; 0.01). There was no effect on the quality of sleep (difference −0.7, −2.1 to 0.6, P = 0.27). The combined analysis of sleep related outcomes showed a moderate to large effect of didgeridoo playing (difference between summary z scores −0.78 SD units, P &lt; 0.01). Changes in health related quality of life did not differ between groups.

**Conclusion** Regular didgeridoo playing is an effective treatment alternative well accepted by patients with moderate obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.

Quote from beekeeping on tumblr:
&gt; bees are one of the most important animals in the world and their job is a lot more than gathering honey but also because they are what scientists refer to as an “indicator species""

&gt; this means that when their populations start dwindling and then rapidly dropping, too. bees basically act as an indication that humans have a lot to worry about and when they start dying like this it deserves a lot more than a few headlines.

&gt; Without bees

&gt; your future life without kiwis, strawberries, blackberries, peaches, sunflowers, cotton, apples, pears, tomatoes, melons

&gt; Bees are amazing creatures who are responsible for the comfortable lives we lead in this country and we cannot sustain and feed our population without them.

&gt; Bees are literally some of the most important creatures on this planet. I am not usually one for valuing certain living things over other living things, especially in poorly developed areas, living too? Then you still like bees.

&gt; Same to that, bee keepers are the only reason hive roosting social bee species are even still in an area. They don’t just harvest honey. They take care of and maintain their bees tirelessly, and are a boon to the environment as a result, because their busy little honey makers are out there pollinating the fields of nearby flowers and farmers, pollinating small gardens and fruit trees. Bee diseases are also largely unregulated by governments and completely controlled by bee keepers. Never, ever turn your back on a bee keeper. For all you know, they are the heros of the human race

&gt; Also of concern are farmers planting massive fields of plants with beautiful, and becomes inedible to the bees as a result. Honeybees that belong to a bee keeper can be artificially fed through winter if the honey stores are bad… but wild honeybees do not have that luxury and the colony will die.

&gt; Want to help somehow? Consider keeping bees yourself, many lbs of honey, even with two harvests during a good summer. You can also become involved with your local bee keeping groups! However, bee keeping isn’t for everyone. There are much smaller things you can do:

* Have beekeeper and bees in mind when choosing what regulations you support. Be loud about the things you are against!
* Plant a variety of fragrant summer blooms in your garden. Attracting bees is both good for your flowers and good for the bees! The more variety they have
* Consider leaving out water for wild bees. Peat moss lightly flooded in a dish, especially in developed areas where water sources are few.
* Don’t treat your garden with pesticides!
* Support your local bee keepers! Buy your honey local from farmer’s markets.
* Can’t find local honey? Buying online from a small time beekeeper is your next best option. Actually, taste, and thickness.

Fresh food: Unless you're getting food during a rush period (Often 11am-1pm and 5pm-7pm) or at a very high volume store

- Ask for your meat with no salt. All burgers are sprinkled with a salt/pepper mixture after being cooked. Asking for it without salt will ensure your meat is freshly cooked. This rule applies to french fries and Filet O Fish as well. Any small meat (McDoubles) is around 40 seconds to cook

- Fried chicken items (Nuggets, most stores won't have much fuss over it, as it gives them more time to prepare your food, it is often prepared better as well. Be aware that cooking times for nuggets and mcchicken patties are around 4 minutes, and crispy chicken items are nearly 7 minutes.

- Order a McDouble/Dbl Cheeseburger without ketchup and mustard

- The same can be done with their most horrible new creation, onions and lettuce. It saves you quite a bit of money to just order as that. Around 60 cents. It amazes me how many people buy so many of these and don't realize it.

- Never buy a 10 piece nugget. Purchasing them as a 20pc or 4pc boxes is cheaper.

You probably did because you've walked through your local super-market or chain box store.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/kTgCblp.jpg) and [This](http://i.imgur.com/1U7wWeh.jpg) are **Cup Plungers** and are designed to unclog sink and bathtub drains. These are also the classic or original plunger designs and can be used for toliet bowls but are more suited for sinks/bathtubs because **your toilet bowl drain is curved** The bottom of these plungers is flat so it is more difficult to form a seal with the bowl

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/YQOdQGB.jpg) you can see the differences between a sink plunger (on the left) and a toilet plunger (on the right). Toilet plungers are also known as **flange plungers.** 

This more modern design is better for toliet bowl uncloggin because of it's curved shape it is significantly easier to get a seal between plunger and bowl and with the increase in size you trap a large volume of air in the seal which makes for a more powerful plunge.

You should also remember that as with anything price matters. Cheap plungers will not preform as good and for as long as ones that cost a more. 

Additionally you should have a cup plunger and flange plunger just because of the specific uses but also because you shouldn't be using a toilet plunger in the sink because of sanitation issues. 

------------------

Here are some steps for how to plunge a toilet properly. 

Place the plunger in the bowl so that it forms a seal.

Push down slowly until the cup of the plunger is completely compressed.
(WARNING: This is where people cause damage to their toilets! If you push down too hard

With a quick jerk

Repeat until the toilet drains.

So you’re wondering why on earth would you want to pull the clog back up? You’re trying to send it down the drain, just like a car that’s stuck in the snow, until it can move forward.

**Use fewer if you’re referring to people or things in the plural (e.g. houses, students, children). *Or calories ;)*.**

For example:
 
People these days are buying fewer newspapers. 
Fewer students are opting to study science-related subjects.
Fewer than thirty children each year develop the disease.
 
**Use less when you’re referring to something that can’t be counted or doesn’t have a plural (e.g. money, music, rain).**

For example:
 
It’s a better job but they pay you less money.
People want to spend less time in traffic jams.

Less is also used with numbers when they are on their own and with expressions of measurement or time

So

You're asking the expert here. I had trouble falling asleep for a long time

Before bed: 

1. Get off the internet at least 20-30 minutes prior. Also

2. If you can't get offline

3. If you're really hungry

4. Take some melatonin if you really have a hard time. Read [this link](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/17gffp/proper_use_of_melatonin_please_upvote/) for more information on dosage and long-term use. As always

5. Avoid eating a meal at least 3 hours before bed.

6. If you're super hungry

7. No caffeine at least 5 hours before bed. Seriously. Also, try stopping earlier and earlier until you figure out your personal timing.**

8. Brush and floss yo damn teeth.


Bedtime:

1. If you need to remember something for tomorrow, put the garbage can in front of the front door, or do what I do and set up reminders in Thunderbird (or Outlook, whatever.)) If you think of something you forgot to write on the list, immediately get up and write it down on the list. It will bug you and you WILL forget.

2. Be comfortable. Experiment with different thicknesses of pillows. Have a decent mattress. Use clean sheets. Clean sheets feel awesome. Don't be too hot or too cold. I like it a little cold at night

3. White noise. I use a white noise generator which is just a fan inside a plastic box, etc. If you have a loud neighborhood and cars or slamming doors wake you up, work on your soundproofing or white noise. Yes, you might have to pay some money to make life comfortable. Don't be a cheapskate; some things are worth it. Getting a good night's sleep is one of the most important things you can do for quality of life.

4. Don't think about shit you need to do tomorrow. Don't worry about bad stuff that might happen. Don't dwell on past mistakes. You won't remember anything in the morning anyway

5. Relax your muscles. All of them. Your jaw, your butt. Even your feet. Take a mental inventory of your whole body from your scalp to your toes and make sure they're all unclenched. A stressful life can mean you're clenching your muscles all day, and you may become used to it.

6. Breathe deeply and slowly for a few minutes. Get your heart rate down. You can't just jump into bed with your heart going 90 or 100bpm and expect to fall asleep.

7. Think about something enjoyable, but then you can end up with a mess to clean up.) Good options are: what you would do with lottery winnings, what would your perfect house be like, how would you build a zombie-proof mansion, what beach resort would you like to visit. Think about that TV show or movie you watched most recently, or your favorite. Go through it scene by scene in your mind. 

I have this one where I try to figure out how to find people in a world where all the people have disappeared. I run through a list of all the shit I'd do, etc. For me, picturing a world devoid of people is pretty relaxing.

A lot of times just reviewing the day's events
BUT

Once you find something that works


Sleep well.

OK, you can use that space for something else now if you'd like."" But the computer isn't actually going to *do* that until you have new files that it decides to put there. In short, nothing is ever really ""deleted"", it just gets eventually overwritten with something new. So if there's nothing new, the old file is still there.

So, and while YOU may not be able to see them by default (because that's how the OS is designed to work) people with file recovery software almost definitely can see them if they get access to your phone.

So if you want to actually delete something, I don't know about smartphones). [Here's a wikihow article that'll give you some places to start](http://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Files-Forever). These programs overwrite the file you want to delete with random 1s and 0s, and tell the computer that space is still free.

EDIT: NOPE ~~Now, some software can still read parts or all of old files even if they've been overwritten once or twice, so if you really need to be secure, you should use software that can overwrite the file a few times (I believe the DoD standard is 7). This makes deleting files take a *lot* longer, but it also means that when they're gone they're actually gone.~~

There are even programs that will help you do this with ALL your empty HDD space at once (or just use the erase free space option in Mac's disk util with the right settings). It takes forever, so there's very little chance of them being recovered.

While we sleep we lose a significant amount of water due to respiration and perspiration. We lose over twice the amount of water sleeping than we do resting awake. Which explains part of why we lose weight while we sleep.

So...when you sleep for a longer duration of time you lose even more water, are false. We simply just need to hydrate.

1339586697.0,uznlh,YSK the following about 911 services,FunInTheSun85,1698,478,409,"Hey there

A little background on me: I've been a 911 operator for 4 years for a large agency that services approximately 750

Of course every agency is different and what I say here might not be exactly how it works for other agencies but I'll try to keep it as broad as possible.

So here are a few tips in no particular order that might prove helpful to you if you ever have to dial 911

* The most important thing to give the 911 operator is your location, say, a 500 meter radius of the tower. Not very helpful if we're trying to locate you. Sometimes I will get a general area of where your actual phone is, but again, I've seen calls with a radius of up to 1700 meters. Pretty useless. Sometimes I can retransmit the signal and get those meters down to about 10 but that is hit or miss, plus if you're in an apartment complex it will not tell me which exact apartment you're in. Doing an actual cell ""ping"" or ""trace"" through the cell company can take anywhere between 10 and 30 minutes. Again, not helpful if you need the cops ASAP. If you really have no idea where you're at, numbers on buildings

* Calling 911 from a land line will result in your exact address popping up on my screen. If you have a choice between calling 911 from a cell or a land line, as stated above policies vary by agency but this seems to be a fairly common one across agencies). 

* Even if you dial 911 and hang up before you think it went through, do your operator a favor and just stay on the line and tell them it was a false alarm. Otherwise  we have to call back and make sure you're ok, and if you don't answer we have to send the cops to make sure you're ok (assuming it was as land line call and we have an address).

* Answer the questions the operator is asking you. I understand that if you're dialing 911 you're probably in stressful situation and it may be difficult for you, providing us the information we're asking for is going to keep you safer (and the officer safe too).

* Cell phones that have no active service **can** still dial 911

* Dialing 911 with a non-emergency is a serious issue. Keep in mind there are only so many operators answering calls at a given time and if you dial 911 because you're upset that the neighbor's sprinklers are getting your car wet (yep this is an actual 911 call I've taken),000 people and on a **good** staffing day we may have 7 people answering phones. So if only 7 people out of those 750,000 people call 911 because their neighbor's wind chimes are disturbing their peace (again, yes that is a real call one of my partners has taken) someone calling because their baby isn't breathing is going to have to wait. Please limit 911 calls to true emergencies, and if you need non-emergency police assistance call 411 or use google or use a phone book or or or or anything that doesn't tie up a 911 line unnecessarily. 

* When you dial 911 from your cell phone

* As with 911 operators like I mentioned above, which means the cops are going to respond to something like a fight before they're going to respond to something like a noisy party or an illegally parked vehicle. This might seem like a given but I receive countless calls from people complaining about the response time for non-emergencies (especially when it's a noise disturbance) even after they've been told the local units are tied up on an emergency and the response time is going to be extended. Sorry, but we have to deal with the people trying to beat each other to death before we come tell your neighbor to quiet their music down. That's just the way it is.

* EDIT Me continuing to ask you questions doesn't necessarily mean help isn't already on the way. Oftentimes I get your location and basic nature of the emergency

Here's the list of foods that can make your pets ill. Some of them can be fatal: 

* Chocolate-- fast heart rate, epileptic seizures, heart attacks, internal bleeding, and eventually death

* Ethanol (Alcohol)-- animals are generally more susceptible to alcohol than humans are. The caveats here are similar to alcohol poisoning in humans. 

* Raw yeast dough--  intestinal obstruction and/or ethanol poisoning 

* Hops (beer hops) Edit: the plant

* Avocados-- possible damage to the heart muscle cells

* Grapes/raisins-- acute kidney failure

* Macadamia nuts-- non-fatal stiffness, and abdominal pain

* Onions, etc.--  hemolytic anemia

* Xylitol (sweetner found in gum and other sugar-free things)-- toxic or even fatal liver damage

* Moldy or rotten food-- some molds produce toxins called tremorgenic mycotoxins

* Raw meats and raw eggs-- Salmonella and E. coli can be bad. Raw eggs contain an enzyme called avidin that decreases the absorption of biotin (a B vitamin)

* Salt-- Large amounts of salt can produce excessive thirst and urination, depression, tremors, elevated body temperature, seizures and even death.

* Milk-- mammals are naturally lactose intolerant 

* Bones-- choking hazard; splintering can cause damage to soft tissues.

This has gone almost entirely unreported

   Since they swept elections back in May of 2010 the Fidesz party, a relic of the Soviet days - people remember the secret police. To give you some idea of what is happening, one of the first things they did when they took power was rename the country itself to Hungary - from the Republic of Hungary.

   Symbolic, ""pro-government"" protestors had turned out to support the PM as he ""battles"" the EU. In reality it was a protest against *both* him and the EU, but with very little attention on 
Hungary, but you can begin high school early and do as much as 6 or 8 years of it, skipping grades to do more intense work (effectively) if you qualify for it with your test scores. When I was coming up (not that long ago) it was relatively easy to do 6 years (rather than the standard 4) and harder but not impossible to do 8. Now it's almost impossible to get into the 6 year programs, due to the changes they've made to the education system. More than that, though, they've also changed how the university system works. Previously, schools were allowed to give a certain number of their applicants free ride scholarships,000 applicants and 400 would get free rides. Under the new changes

   Hungary is in a bad way and the discontent is growing, but be mindful that most news out of Hungary isn't that reliable.

* [Africa is a lot bigger](http://strangemaps.files.wordpress.com/2006/11/africa_in_perspective_map.jpg) than it looks on your usual Mercador map, Western Europe, India and Argentina in there and still have lots of room left over.

* Africa is not the poorest place in the world. India is. [There are actually more people living in ""extreme poverty"" in India than in all of sub-Saharan Africa](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/14/poverty-india-africa-oxford)

* [Most of the French-speaking people in the world live in Africa.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language#Africa) French is at least one of the official languages of 31 countries in Africa, east and southern Africa. In almost all of those cases, ""local"" languages - Yoruba, Swahili, Xhosa, Zulu, Hausa

* Because it is such a huge continent, famine is very rare throughout most of the continent. Most issues with food security are market failures, not problems with supply.

* [Africa has some of the best economic growth rates in the world.](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/11/29/the_african_miracle) Like much of the developing world

* We are not really to blame for Africa's woes. This is some editorializing on my part, there is still a good deal of colonial influence, particularly in the Francophone countries - but 50 years after independence, African messes are more accurately blamed on leadership failures. One-party strongman rule has been the norm for much of the continent for a long time. Some strongmen were propped up by the West - Mobutu being one famous example - others were not (Kenyatta, Senghor, Eyadema). This dynamic is changing, but change is slow.

* ""Africans"" are an incredibly diverse group; probably more so than in any other geographic entity on earth. Culturally, even genetically, there is far greater diversity in Africa that you will find in Asia, and surely in Europe or North/South America. As the birthplace of human evolution, this shouldn't really be a surprise.

* Africa is often most associated with poverty. It's true - much of the continent is pretty poor. But ""poor"" means very different things for different people. In southern Cameroon, there is sometimes food insecurity, and there used to be a great deal of violence. In Mali, it's often difficult to find any job that allows you more than a subsistence level of income, but schooling and food is available. Access to basic healthcare varies greatly from region to region, country to country, and even town to town. ""Africans"" are not a large group of unhappy poor people.

* Lions, and prefer to shoot 'em on sight.

* Nigerians are not all email spammers. They're actually really nice.

* **Do you really want to ""help Africa?""** Don't give your money to some charity. Go visit! Much of Africa is a lovely place, and the stories you'll have will (hopefully!) help change the frankly awful and misleading image that Africa has been given. That will do more long-term good than almost anything else.

Plus he has a full head of black hair

When I came to the school, how to eat was one of them.  I'll split this into two parts, the **theory** behind how to eat and the **rules** one should follow.

**Benefits** (personal experience):  I've lost about 1kg a week so far even though I wasn't allowed to do any martial arts during the first week (I was told to observe).  Though I expect this to plateau when I get into the rhythm, if anything.  I feel fantastic and my brain is functioning with an incredible clarity.  I'm zooming through my books, my calc textbook and online coursera classes, and I don't feel any sleepiness after eating anymore.

**Theory**:

*We are designed to eat as if food was scarce*.

* Think about our not-too-distant past.  Food was unregulated, when it was available, people would stuff themselves beyond what they required in order to prepare for scarcity later on.

* That our bodies tell us we are full 30 minutes after we achieve ""fullness"" supports this idea

*Half the digestion process is manual*

* Chewing does a huge number of things including adding saliva to help break down food

* ""Food comas"" suggest that too much energy is being used in the automatic system, I haven't had a single food coma.

*Food should not be a mystery*

* In most of the civilized world

* Ideally

**Rules** (note that most of these are to create habits

*Food is no longer scarce*

* Chew 30 times per bite.  I'm serious.  I counted 3, your food should become a kind of porridge before it goes down.  Make sure it's evenly chewed by moving it around and don't bite too hard or your jaw will get sore.

* While you're chewing

* Eat everything on your plate.  Contrary to what you might think

* Really think before you go for seconds.  Do you want more food because you're hungry or because you want to taste more food? If it's the latter

* If possible

* Set up a time limit (around 20-30 minutes) within which you **cannot** finish your food.  You have to finish afterwards.  On the first day I finished in ten minutes and learned that the punishment was that you had to wash your own dishes with freezing cold water.  It's a good incentive to go slower.

When I first implemented these rules, but I know what the consistency of the food should be before I swallow.  

*Food shouldn't be a mystery*

* Cook using basic ingredients.  Most of you won't be able to grow your own food for obvious reasons.  The students here all take part in the growing process

I'll answer any questions you might have.  If there's something a lot of people want to know

1349529915.0,111gt0,YSK Some random useful tips,oliveboom,1512,627,137,"Reheat Pizza 
Heat up leftover pizza in a non-stick skillet on top of the stove
set heat to med-low and heat till warm. This keeps the crust crispy. No soggy micro pizza. I saw this on the cooking channel and it really works. 

Easy Deviled Eggs
Put cooked egg yolks in a zip lock bag. Seal, keep mashing it up mixing thoroughly, cut the tip of the baggy, squeeze mixture into egg. Just throw bag away when done easy clean up.

Expanding Frosting
When you buy a container of cake frosting from the store

Reheating refrigerated bread
To warm biscuits, place them in a microwave with a cup of water. The increased moisture will keep the food moist and help it reheat faster.

Newspaper weeds away
Start putting in your plants; work the nutrients in your soil. Wet 
newspapers put layers around the plants overlapping as you go cover with mulch and forget about weeds. Weeds will get through some gardening plastic they will not get through wet newspapers.

Broken Glass
Use a dry cotton ball to pick up little broken glass pieces of 
glass- the fibers catch ones you can't see!

No More Mosquitoes
Place a dryer sheet in your pocket. It will keep the mosquitoes away.

Squirrel Away!
To keep squirrels from eating your plants sprinkle your plants with cayenne pepper. The cayenne pepper doesn't hurt the plant and the squirrels won't come near it.

Flexible vacuum
To get something out of a heat register or under the fridge add an empty paper towel roll or empty gif wrap roll to your vacuum. It can be bent or flattened to get in narrow openings.

Reducing Static Cling
Pin a small safety pin to the seam of your slip and you will not 
have a clingy skirt or dress. Same thing works with slacks that cling when wearing panty hose. Place pin in seam of slacks and - voila - static is gone.

Measuring Cups
Before you pour sticky substances into a measuring cup, add your ingredient, such as peanut butter, and watch how easily it comes right out.

Foggy Windshield?
Hate foggy windshields? Buy a chalkboard eraser and keep it in the glove box of your car. When the windows fog

Reopening envelope
If you seal an envelope and then realize you forgot to include 
something inside

Conditioner
Use your hair conditioner to shave your legs. It's a lot cheaper 
than shaving cream and leaves your legs really smooth. It's also a great way to use up the conditioner you bought but didn't like when you tried it in your hair...

Goodbye Fruit Flies
To get rid of pesky fruit flies
with Apple Cider Vinegar and 2 drops of dishwashing liquid

Get Rid of Ants
Put small piles of cornmeal where you see ants. They eat it, esp. if it rains, but it works &amp; you don't have the worry about pets or small children being harmed!

Take baby powder to the beach
Keep a small bottle of baby powder in your beach bag. When your ready to leave the beach sprinkle yourself and kids with the powder and the sand will slide right off your skin.",,t5_2r94o,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/111gt0/ysk_some_random_useful_tips/

The real problem regarding ""bath salts"" is that there is no way of knowing what's in that mystery powder you're holding. So if you stop by a local liquor store and buy a counterfeit blend of unknown powder to insufflate, well, you might just decide to chew on someone's face.  
  
From what I hace read and seen, and methylone to reach an extremely psychotic mental state like the ones we have seen in recent events. These aren't new chemicals; these chemicals have been around for many years. The last releases of ""bath salts"" are of a new formula, and the crap that may circulate the streets has no classification whatsoever. It's most likely a completely unknown mix of powder nowadays so it's ignorant to assume that the name ""bath salts"" means the same thing in all cases.  
  
Also, even before ""bath salts"" hit the public. Interestingly enough, toxicology reports for Rudy Eugene haven't been released yet, and his family/friends claim that he never used such a thing. So, how can they automatically claim it was ""bath salts""? Likewise, why didn't they make the same claim about Wayne Carter, who threw intestines as a police officer and then stabbed himself?  
  
I don't condone the use of any drug, the desire to use these ""drug alternatives"" results from the illegality of the real substances they try to mimic, like cocaine, which is relatively a lot safer.

Edit: spelling   
  

**Update:** Rudy Eugene was not on ""bath salts""

Put it back in the bag and wait the full 48 hours if you are not in an immediate rush for the phone. Otherwise it's time for last ditch efforts.

This doesn't work. If you stay up all night you get ""sleep debt"" and you  will end up requiring more sleep in the following days to pay back your sleep debt. Sleep debt is a real phenomenon that has been discussed in academic journals. FYI If you oversleep one night you cannot expect to be able to sleep less the next night. There are no rollover hours.

You can survive 3 weeks without eating so it won't do you any permanent damage to fast until 7am.

Your circadian rhythm is mostly affected by two things:

1.) Sunlight

2.) Meal timings

Even ancient roman philosophers (I'm thinking of Epictetus the Stoic) said that one must first control his eating habits

I have found it relatively easy to force myself to eat once at 7am

Also consider if you are getting enough exercise.


**TL;DR** Don't try to stay up all night. Stop eating right now and fast until your target wake-up time. Eat a large healthy breakfast and get some sunlight in your retina at that time. Repeat until sleep schedule has been fixed

*****

**EDIT** I read the comments and I would like to add some of the things that helpful redditors have mentioned.

Yes

It's winter time so the sun rises late. Daylight savings times helps this however. If you still must rise before the sun consider buying a sun lamp.

Specifically BLUE light is what wakes you up. But any bright light source will stimulate your circadian cycle.

This technique is less effective if you body is used to sporadic meal times.

This technique is consistent with the old adage ""Eat breakfast like a king

Redditor ""ejactulator"" claims to be a physician and PhD student and vouches for this technique. He says he does it when he travels around the world to avoid jet lag. That is also how I learned of this technique. Instead of using it to cure jetlag

Avoid using the internet or watching tv in the hour or two before you go to bed. Find another activity to do during that time that does not require looking at a bright screen.

Consider Melatonin supplements but they are not for everyone. If you suspect your body might not react well then talk to your doctor first.

Be warned that fasting slows down your metabolism and while I say above it will not cause you permanent damage

It's a pro-life organization masquerading as a clinical resource for women contemplating abortion.  When is a clinic not a clinic?  When NO doctors actually work there.  Instead


Here's some of the ""help"" you can expect from these ""trained counsellors"":


~~Limited ultrasounds.  What is a limited ultrasound?  It's a FAKE ultrasound.~~ (CORRECTION: Just found out a ""limited ultrasound"" is not the same as a fake ultrasound.) **Fake ultrasounds.**  (You don't need to be a medical professional to operate these.)  They show you a fake image of a fake fetus waving, and telling you that's *your baby*, even if your fetus is just weeks old and little more than a peanut at that stage.  These people WILL and DO take advantage of ignorance and happily deceive and misinform where it suits their moral agenda.  Guilt and shame are their weapons of choice.


**Lying about the age of your fetus**.  Legal abortions can be obtained within a very limited timeframe (laws vary by state).  If the deadline is near, the deadline will have passed.


**Where can Crisis Pregnancy Centers be found?**  There's a good chance there's one near your local Planned Parenthood


This is how Crisis Pregnancy Centers reward the vulnerable and often distraught women who put their trust in them: **with lies**.  They represent everything evil and wrong with this kind of morality, cheat, and suppress individual choice as long as it is for the ""right"" reasons.


**In short



EDIT for **SOURCE**: I understand the skepticism

I didn't include sources because they're unofficial, since protestors treat anyone walking into a Planned Parenthood like a child murderer), I have only contempt for these extremist members of the pro-life movement.

You see,"" passengers, to use the vernacular of the day. Rosa Parks is famous because she was arrested for an event of ""civil disobedience,"" which transpired on one of these segregated buses.

Parks was sitting the colored section of the bus and the white section filled. When a white passenger told her to get up because he wanted her seat, I'm sure you all know.

--------------------------
###An explanation of what's happening:

reddit link syntax allows for title text: If you quote a string of text after you include the link

If the link itself is a superscript ""\\\[?\\\]""

For added functionality, if someone clicks the link, it won't take them off the page.

I figure this might be helpful for link citations in places such as /r/AskHistorians

----------------------------
EDIT:
[The comment system reddit uses is called Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link ""oh hey look you looked at this :)"")

&gt;     [Link text 1](/url/1/goes/here ""Title text goes here"") [Link text 2](/url/2/goes/here ""More title text!"")

is identical to this:

&gt;     [Link text 1][tag1] [Link text 2][tag2]
&gt;     
&gt;     [tag1]: /url/1/goes/here ""Title text goes here""
&gt;     [tag2]: /url/2/goes/here ""More title text!""

The second format lets you list the link information at the end (really anywhere) of the comment

1) **Everything depends on the restaurant's location and the manager.**
       At my McDonald's alone, with that; ** THIS IS FAST FOOD, THE FOOD CAN BE PERFECT BUT WILL MOST LIKELY NOT BE**
avoid ghetto ones

Food quality varies and Ronald McDonald gives no fucks.

2) **You can ask for your food fresh.**

cook times are small, as mostly we don't give a shit if you wait. ESPECIALLY with coffee, the shit sits there.

3) **You have a food allergy.**

Every order you place, we HAVE to change our gloves, and wipe down the table we make the food with a clean cloth.

4) **If the drink station isnt in view of us

seriously

5) **Free cups!**
  There is a way. Ask for a cup of ice

6) **Coffee has free refills.**

The rule is, we wont give a fuck

7) **Don't place larger orders.**
  Im not saying this so my job is just easier, it increases the chance i make the burger just ketchup and pickles, instead of mustard, ketchup, onions, pickles, and cheese. This especially applies on Burger Tuesday, ask for your sandwich with extra something

8) **Order your fries without salt.**
   Add your own salt

9)**The later at night it is
   like 11pm

10)**Most common old items**
This can change

-Angus
-Mushrooms
-Grilled Onions
-Filet

11)**if it touches the table
we only wipe down the table with a rag, that's not edible either.

12)**I'm a human being
The people differ from restaurant to restaurant, it's a good thing to be nice. Dick.

13) **The new McWraps are a pain in the ass to make**
   So please

14)**if your son/child/you got the wrong toy

chances are

With a quick Google search, haven't looked back.

I've always had problems with sweat and odor, flaky, and burning at times.

&gt;Be sure to follow the directions about mixing the dry stuff together, I used a microwave to heat them for about 20 seconds.

&gt;My mixture consists of:
* 3 Tbsp coconut oil
* 1 Tbsp baking soda
* 1 Tbsp cornstarch

&gt;... and the optional additions:
* 1/8 tsp Vitamin E oil
* 1/8 tsp Shea Butter
* 8-10 drops Tea Tree oil


&gt;I put the finished product in a small glass jar that used to hold pimentos, I just open it and apply because the mixture sits just above the lip of the jar. Note that you don't have to keep it in the fridge, but just know that it will liquefy in temperatures over 75 deg F (25 deg C).  You can add whatever oils suit your taste, but I love tea tree for its aroma, and anti-viral/anti-fungal properties.

I was skeptical at first when I made it because we hadn't hit hundred-degree temperatures yet here in Texas, no stains on clothing, and I've even made it for 5 people, which in turn, have made it for others. 

Of course, just like the website I linked first, I have also begun to sweat less, and I still can't believe it. I can actually skip a day and not put any deodorant on, and I don't sweat or have odor even half as much as I did when I was constantly re-applying with the store bought stuff. 

Seriously

It works!

Edit: Reporting in after running errands in 113 degree F heat. It's still working!
Edit 2: Forgot to mention how amazingly soft my skin is now. It used to be dry

*Edit 3: Alright guys, so chill. The point I was trying to get across was that if you've never thought of making your own deodorant, and you have issues with products that you've tried that have failed in some way, then I suggest you try this method. What will it hurt? For years I tried different things, and this works well FOR ME. It's obviously not for everyone. Unless you have an allergy to any of the ingredients mentioned, then you're set. See if this will work for you as amazingly as it has for myself and my friends. That's it.*",,,,

1294032688.0,ev9k8,10 tips before you sign a housing rental agreement (from a former landlord),JJJJShabadoo,584,79,268,"It seems like a couple of times a week there are AskReddit threads about landlord problems.  Having been a landlord

1.  Always, don't assume that because your buddy recommended the landlord that you've got nothing to worry about.  Read the entire thing.  A contract is a two-way agreement, so if you see terms in there that you're uncomfortable about, you can black them out. 

2.  Document/photograph the premises the second you move in.  Before you open a single box, of every door, every window, every shelf, every appliance from every angle, all the plumbing, all the tiles, cracks in the floor, etc.  At my last apartment

And again

3.  In the event of a problem, call 911 if there's a fire, but if your heater breaks down, call the landlord rather that calling a repairman.  At most properties, landlords have existing relationships with maintenance people.  If you call in for work done yourself, you're going to cause some real problems.  There is a caveat to this: state laws generally grant landlords a specific amount of time to repair certain things.  A heater, for example, *get it in writing.*

4.  In the event of conflict, obviously, and AG's spell out your rights and responsibilities.

5.  Communicate with your landlord.  You may find yourself unable to pay your rent on time one month.  Hey, tell the truth), and grant them an extension.  In some of the more extreme cases we did assess penalties, but they were for less than what the contract specified and it was because the tenant was habitually late or because the rent was paid unreasonably late (e.g. a month late).

6.  A security deposit is just that, it isn't leverage for them to hold against you because you didn't dust the blinds when you moved out.  It's to protect them against damages.  I've never heard of a state where this was not the case.  If your landlord takes *any* money from your security deposit, it must be documented, and in most cases, the difference returned to you within 30 days.  Check with the AG site for this one.  **Your rent covers wear and tear.**  Having the carpets shampooed once a year is generally something the courts will say is the landlord's responsibility, assuming you  haven't been disassembling a motorcycle in the living room.  In cases where a deduction is made, it must be reasonable.  I once had a landlord take $160 from my deposit because I did not dust the electrical outlets.  This is not reasonable, suppose that you wreck a wall in one of the bedrooms.  A contractor comes and patches the wall, or anything like that.  They can only deduct the $200

7.  Going to small claims: an unfortunate reality is that too many landlords are dishonest pricks.  You may find yourself getting screwed by one.  Good news, fill out a form, pay a fee, and a date is set.  Here's where your documentation comes into play.  I guarantee you that the landlord is going to paint you as the most awful tenant that ever walked the face of the earth, so you want to have dated pictures that demonstrate otherwise.  If you can get sworn statements from neighbors, that's good too.  Be calm, dress nice, give the court your evidence.  If you're in the right, they walk away.  Don't be passive about it.  

8.  Oral agreements: meaningless.  Get it in writing.  Exception: if you've already been there a while and are going to move to month-to-month tenancy.  Then

9.  Landlord rights: without a court order, or make unilateral changes to your contract.  They can't increase your rent halfway through, no matter what economic hardships they face.  Remember, your contract is a two-way agreement.  They can't change it without your consent any more than you can change it without their consent.

10.  Let your wallet do the talking.  This borders on ethics, and you've got parking enforcement that sits and waits for a car to show up without a sticker to boot them (and then charge $100 to remove it), don't stand for that crap.  Go to the landlord and say, ""If I have to pay $100 to get my own car unbooted because my parking sticker fell off, I'm going to deduct it from my rent.""  This is generally something to do for situations that fall outside contract terms.  Be reasonable, and let your landlord have some financial incentive to keep the cashflow coming.",,,,

My sister and I both have 3g phones so we actually weren't using that much data. The verizon rep LIED to me when he said that if I bought a 4g phone out of pocket that I would lose my grandfathered in data plan anyway.

That was a lie! The only way to lose the grandfathered in data plan is if you stop paying your bill or sign a new 2 year contract or give permission to change the plan. Activating a new 4g phone (even if you are using 3g) won't change your grandfathered in data plan.

* There are several ways to disagree, treat a disagreement as a competition, or try to trick or manipulate other people into accepting your point of view.
* The way you're communicating is (at least) as important as the information you're communicating. Perhaps you have a rock-solid formalized logical argument but you make everyone you know hate you. No one's going to be convinced by your argument if no one will talk to you.
* It's not anyone's job to ""fix"" other people. Correcting someone when they're about to make a life-threatening mistake is a moral obligation. Correcting someone when they mess up a minor detail in a story just makes you a tool.
* Treating a disagreement as a competition is a very bad idea.

And here are some practical applications he gave at the end of the talk:

* Suspend judgement until the argument is over. Even if you are convinced of your own correctness
* Agree to have the discussion before actually having it. If you are arguing with someone who doesn't want to argue
* Seek understanding before advocacy. Try to learn what it is
* Treat each other fairly. This is a no-brainer but important to remember. Don't treat someone in a way you wouldn't want to be treated.
* Assume good intentions. People rarely do bad things on purpose. Stealing is bad but people who steal are trying to accomplish something good like feeding themselves or having something they need. Other people might seem bad to you
* Before you respond

&gt;According to the same principles as a submission's score.

&gt;A comment's score is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the comment and three users don't it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not ""real"" numbers, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is correct, but the vote totals are ""fuzzed"".

The most important thing to realize is that chemicals aren't bad. Chemicals form every material thing, are natural! In addition, it doesn't matter if a certain chemical comes from ""natural sources"" or is synthesized in a factory. At the end of the day, it is the same chemical.

This isn't to say that all chemicals are good. Many chemicals are toxic, it is the identity of the chemical of interest (as well as how much of it is around) that determines whether or not you should keep it away from yourself or your children. Lead is quite toxic, but your drinking water will surely contain some of it. And this isn't necessarily a bad thing. There ARE safe levels of lead that can exist in drinking water, and it is unlikely that your drinking water contains an unsafe amount.

So two examples...

1. I want to reduce the amount of time I spend on reddit.  

Log in to your router

You are now free to reddit whenever you want.  But because it will take more than 20 seconds to allow you to do it you'll get bored before you get there and end up doing something useful instead.

2. Exercising in the morning.

This may seem like it should be harder because its a positive habit you have to learn not a negative one to avoid but it isn't.  Its actually really simple.

Before you go to bed, and then get dressed in your full gym kit.  I mean everything, socks included.

That way when you wake up, and you're already halfway to the gym.

First bits: I want you to be aware. The second bit will be all about how to get rid of us(as a person, I'll listen to them, until I'm sure they won't interest me.)

1. We're not a scam. Well

There are a lot of fields of telemarketing. Some you've asked for

2. We're sorry for interrupting dinner.

We're on an automated dialer system. We work hours that (most of) you don't work. Myself, it IS by accident, and we feel bad. So do our supervisors, which is why we offer to call back later.

So

1. First off - Let's get rid of telemarketing calls.

First step - [Put your number on the National Do Not Call List](https://www.donotcall.gov/register/reg.aspx)

There you go. We're done.

Well

Step 2:

2. You're going to still get calls.

There's a reason for this. With most places, because if you're smart enough to be a redditor, you're smart enough to do research. If you need a starting place, fcc.gov is a good place.

The basic breakdown is this:

*A charity(ie MADD or Special Olympics)

*Someone you've done business with (Sears with their stupid Shop Your Way Rewards program or A school you've been interested in.)

No matter what happens

You're on the DNC(do not call list)

Great, though, because a lot of people think that it's all the same person. In my organization, when you ask for us to stop calling, we're watching our asses and do it. Pay attention to the exact phone number. WE don't call again, and we're tired of being accused as such.

Working as a waiter was easier than this. We bow to your every wish

If you're on the DNC and ask us to stop calling, the phone companies would back us up, proving that we stopped after you asked us to.

Also, and when you ask to be taken off of our list, we're glad for you. Don't be an asshole, and tell your friends and especially your elder family the same.

It boils down to this:

DNC

After that: Please take me off of your calling list.

Also, CCNP, MCITP, Oracle, Medical/Legal Transcription, etc.) you can write us off or listen and schedule a callback while you research. I was skeptical of my company too until I researched.

According to the [army study guide](http://www.armystudyguide.com/content/Prep_For_Basic_Training/Prep_for_basic_first_aid/apply-a-tourniquet.shtml):

DANGER: A tourniquet is only used on an arm or leg where there is a danger of the casualty losing his life (bleeding to death).

A tourniquet is a constricting band placed around an arm or leg to control bleeding. A service member whose arm or leg has been completely amputated may not be bleeding when first discovered, lower leg, or arm and bleeding from multiple arteries (which occurs in a traumatic amputation) may prove to be beyond control by manual pressure. If the pressure dressing under firm hand pressure becomes soaked with blood and the wound continues to bleed, apply a tourniquet.

WARNING Casualty should be continually monitored for development of conditions which may require the performance of necessary basic lifesaving measures, preventing shock, and/or bleeding control. All open (or penetrating) wounds should be checked for a point of entry or exit and treated accordingly.

The tourniquet should not be used unless a pressure dressing has failed to stop the bleeding or an arm or leg has been cut off. On occasion, it must stay in place, and the casualty must be taken to the nearest MTF as soon as possible. DO NOT loosen or release a tourniquet after it has been applied as release could precipitate bleeding and potentially lead to shock.

Improvising a Tourniquet.
In the absence of a specially designed tourniquet, such as gauze or muslin bandages, clothing, or cravats. An improvised tourniquet is used with a rigid stick-like object. To minimize skin damage, ensure that the improvised tourniquet is at least 2 inches wide. 

WARNING The tourniquet must be easily identified or easily seen. 

WARNING DO NOT use wire or shoestring for a tourniquet band.

Placing the Improvised Tourniquet

a. Place the tourniquet around the limb, or joint. Tourniquets, for maximum effectiveness, should be placed on the upper arm or above the knee on the thigh

b. The tourniquet should be well-padded. If possible, keeping the material as flat as possible. Damaging the skin may deprive the surgeon of skin required to cover an amputation. Protection of the skin also reduces pain.

Applying the Tourniquet.

a. Tie a half-knot. (A half-knot is the same as the first part of tying a shoe lace.)

b. Place a stick (or similar rigid object) on top of the half-knot

c. Tie a full knot over the stick

d. Twist the stick until the tourniquet is tight around the limb and/or the bright red bleeding has stopped. In the case of amputation

e. Fasten the tourniquet to the limb by looping the free ends of the tourniquet over the ends of the stick. Then bring the ends around the limb to prevent the stick from loosening. Tie them together on the side of the limb

NOTE Other methods of securing the stick may be used as long as the stick does not unwind and no further injury results. NOTE If possible

f. DO NOT cover the tourniquet-you should leave it in full view. If the limb is missing (total amputation)

g. Mark the casualty's forehead with a ""T"" and the time to indicate a tourniquet has been applied. If necessary

h. Check and treat for shock.

i. Seek medical aid.

First off

- Put loose leaf tea in a teapot.

- Put boiling water in teapot.

- Cover teapot.

- Wait for 3~5 minutes.

- Pour some tea from the teapot to your cup

- Depending on the tea

- If you accidentally put too much loose leaf tea into the tea cup

- Whenever your tea is cold

- 95% of the time


Note: There will be loose leaf in your cup.  You don't finish the entire cup; by that I mean whenever you are close to finish

Tea Drinking (Yum Cha) and Dim Sum - You can read the [Wiki here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dim_sum)

Some basic table manner:

- The youngest person (except children) should always be pouring tea for everyone.  You always pour tea to the oldest person first

- When pouring tea

- Pour your cup **LAST**.  Never pour your cup first.  

- Only pour tea in tea cup

- After you finish pouring the tea, and the handle should always be facing you (implying you will always be pouring)

- Usually you don't pick up the tea cup to pour tea in; unless you have really shaky hands.

- When someone pour tea to your cup

Food ordering (dim sum):

- Most of the Western table manner applies here.

- When you run out of tea during Yum Cha

- Before eating the last piece

- If you are eating rice or noodle

- If there is a favorite piece of food on a plate that you like

- If there's a dish on the table that you really like, the table will have a spinning top that lets you rotate the food.  If it doesn't, then you shouldn't be standing up to intrude.

- Don't put the chopstick in your mouth.  Don't suck it.  Don't lick it.

- When ordering food (Dim Sum)

- When you are done eating, and you definitely don't leave it in the food.  You don't separate the chopsticks.

- Don't shake your leg.

- Try not to do too much with your hand (I guess that would be the same as Western Table manner).

- Eat on your small bowl.  Dispose of the bones or others on the plate.  Only noobs eat on the plates.

- Always try to pay... lol.

Accreditation is the #1 way to tell if you are attending a 'real' college.  If your school is [regionally accredited](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_accreditation) then it is almost certainly a real school.  If it is [nationally accredited](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_accreditation) then you should consider this school 'not' accredited; this may seem harsh

Also, but you aren't really considered an 'engineer' with out this accreditation.

* Website

This is an easy check, even if it *is* .edu that doesn't mean it's accredited or a good college.

* Credit transfer

This is a huge red flag.  If other colleges won't accept credit from this school

Go to the app's page using the links below and click the ""Block App"" link.  Ta-da

**How to Find the URL to Block Other News Apps**

  https://www.facebook.com/dialog/permissions.request?app_id=225771117449558&amp;display=page...

The only part you are interested in is the app_id

  https://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id= (followed by the app_id number you copied from the original URL)

Then post a comment with the URL here so I can add it to our list above to make it easier for other people to block the app as well.

Note:  Whatever you do, and perpetuating this system.  If you have friends who have added the apps, contact them and ask them to remove the apps.  If enough people do that we can force them to stop this annoying ""Open Graph"" crap.

1) There will be a wait.  A *long* wait.  This is mostly because of a lack of rooms/beds.  I usually give the restaurant analogy of table seating. We have to get someone out before we get you in. We can't just pump you full of dilaudid in the waiting room and send you home.  There might be a serious issue we have to address.

2) I know that you're out there for a long time but please don't send someone out for McD's if you say you have been throwing up all day.  It could possibly make things worse or delay a test you may need.

3) Speaking of long waits: If we let you sit out there for hours it probably means that you are not dying. There is an initial assessment done when you first check in and we will decide what your priority level is.  Basic rule of thumb that I've noticed: If you can repeatedly ask us why it's taking so long then you are not in mortal peril.  The ones that are really sick don't talk or move or complain.  To sum up-- If we don't rush you back immediately

4) If you are female under the age of 60 we will most likely need to know if you are pregnant

5) We know that your family and friends are important to you, we clean them ALOT. And thoroughly.  But it doesn't matter. It's gross.  You don't want them crawling around on it.

6) If you really can't breathe

7) Taking an ambulance will not get you seen faster.  Think of it as a limo ride to the hospital.  I've seen women take ambulances for bad menstrual cramps.

8) Certain things need to be done to figure out what is wrong with you.  Please just follow what we ask you to do.  We don't live in Harry Potter land and can just magically fix you by looking at you.  We'll need blood

That's all for now.  It's late.

Basically you sent up long term ""goals"" that you have and want to save money for. For myself, one for my renter's insurance, and one for my new computer I want to build.

What happens is, $10 for my renter's insurance etc out of my checking account. The goal is that at the end of 6 months (I get a discount for doing this instead of paying monthly), I'll be able to pay them entirely. So when my $360 car insurance bill comes, I don't say ""Oh shit, I don't have that right now."", I simply empty the account, pay the bill

The aim of this post will be to provide an objective answer. A PubMed search and some Googling turned up several studies in which the penis was measured by medical personnel. In the following list
    
    
Group 1: Studies specifically aimed at determining average penis size
    
[Study 1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8709382) - 80 American men:
NBPEL (100% erection induced by drug injection) = 5.08"". FSL = 4.88"".
It appears (from reading another source) that the 5.08"" figure is non-bone pressed.
    
[Study 2](http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/WolfFiles/story?id=90588) - 300 men
NBPEL = 5.88"". EG (midshaft) = 4.97"".

FSL = 5.31"".
    
[Study 5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=17151695)   - 1500 Iranian men
FSL = 4.56"".
    
[Study 6](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12350491)  - 52 Greek men
FSL = 4.80"".
    
[Study 7](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17568760)  - 301 Indian men:
FSL = 4.28"". A subset of 93 of these men were measured erect
    
[Study 8](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0021-75572007000600008&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=en)  - not included in calculations or discussion below) - 84 Brazilian men
BPFSL = 5.71"". The 90th percentile for BPFSL among these 18-year-old men was approximately 6.61"".
        
    
Group 2: Studies in which average penis size was not the primary goal of investigation (Some guys have expressed concern that doctors fake data in penis-size studies in order to relieve men's insecurities. The following studies should not be prone to this criticism.)
        
[Study 9](http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~msbm/list_of_publications/articles_in_journals/IJIR_12_328-333.pdf) - 55 Israeli men
        
[Study 10](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11182344) - 111 ""younger"" (18-19 years old) and 32 ""older"" (40-68 years old
    
[Study 11](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12230622) - 104 British men
FSL = 5.12"".
    
[Study 12](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12937799) - 123 Korean men

NBPEL = 5.01"".
    
[Study 14](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=17191423&amp;query_hl=25&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum) - 115 Nigerian men
FSL = 5.30"". Range: 2.95""-7.68"".
    
[Study 15](http://www.osbon.com.au/fraiman.pdf) - 100 American men who had had a prostatectomy (47-74 years old) and 130 who had not (47-74 years old)
BPEL (prostatectomy) = 6.06"". BPEL (no surgery) = 5.98"". EG (prostatectomy) = 4.65"". EG (no surgery) = 4.57"". 
    
    
Out of these high-quality studies, who probably had small fat pads). For the three studies that did not include erect measurements, we can estimate that the erect figure would have been about 0.25"" longer than the reported stretched flaccid length, judging from the differences in studies that included both FSL and EL. For these three additional studies, the average erect length can be inferred to range from 4.46"" BPEL to 5.37"" (might be NBP or BP).
    
Studies in which size is verified by a third party, the famous Kinsey self-report survey found an average NBPEL of 6.16"", while a Durex online survey showed an average of 6.4"" NBPEL. In my opinion, to trust men's anonymous self-reports over the data of seven objective medical studies demonstrates penis-size paranoia -- something to which we are prone here. If we look at the objective data instead, the average erect penis length appears to be no greater than 5.5 - 6.5"" BP -- and may even be smaller.

Because I had a line on our account that wasn't being used, and then re-activate it afterwards, but I'm not sure. Then all you need to do is ask to switch the phone numbers of your phone and the disabled one. BOOM, new phone same unlimited data plan.

If you already have one of these, then switch your number to it. What I'm not 100% sure about, is whether you can go in, disable a line on your account, do the same thing, then reactivate it.

This worked for me.  (scammer calling me constantly at work)

Tell them you need an original signed bill.  They will offer to fax you one.  Tell them you need ink on the paper and for it to be postmarked.  They will insist against this.  Tell them the only means of communication you authorize is through the mail.  They will threaten to send your 'case' to collections, to not call you until they've done so and hang up the phone (you can do this much earlier if you like).  Send a certified and notarized cease and dessist stating that the US mail is the only authorized means of communication, if they continue calling, but they probably won't.


Telephone or e-mail scammers do not want to send you anything through the post office because it is considered mail fraud and much more easy to prosecute than telephone/fax/e-mail scams.  If you are unsure of a bill collector that calls you (you should be), they probably won't.

Elevated blood sugar after meals could increase the risk of type-2 diabetes

Diabetes UK said there were ""small differences"" between exercise routines - but any activity was beneficial.

The US study was the first to test short bouts of exercise in the ""risky period"" following meals
 
She said high blood sugar after meals was a key risk factor in the progression from impaired glucose tolerance - what the study called ""pre-diabetes"" - to type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

The study found three 15-minute walks were as effective at reducing blood sugar over a 24-hour period as one 45-minute walk of the same ""easy-to-moderate"" pace.

But walking after food was ""significantly more effective"" at ""blunting the potentially damaging elevations in post-meal blood sugar commonly observed in older people"".

Older people may be ""particularly susceptible"" to poor blood sugar control after meals due to insulin resistance in the muscles and slow or low insulin secretion from the pancreas

They found the best time to walk was after the evening meal

This increase often lasted ""well into the night and early morning""

Researchers studied 10 people aged 60 and over who were at risk of developing type-2 diabetes due to higher-than-normal levels of fasting blood sugar and insufficient physical activity.

Dr DiPietro said the findings could lead to an ""inexpensive strategy"" for preventing type-2 diabetes

Weight loss and exercise are widely accepted as key ways to prevent type-2 diabetes

Diabetes UK estimates there are up to seven million UK people at ""high risk"" of developing type-2 diabetes.

Dr Matthew Hobbs

Talking about the comparison between one 45-minute walk and three 15-minute walks after meals, even at a low intensity, is good for you.""
