1374171814.0,1ikpjb,My basic lentils and rice + stir fry recipe,Maklodes,33,7,5,"This recipe is honestly nothing special (it's a basic rice and lentils dish), I might as well post it here.

**Ingredients**

* 1 cup rice (I prefer brown; white basmati, also works)

* 1 cup of lentils (any lentils other than red lentils work)

* 1 teaspoon ground cumin

* 1/2 teaspoon salt

* juice from 1 lemon

* 2 tablespoons of olive oil

* 1 medium onion

* 2 cloves of garlic

* 1 bell pepper (colors other than green preferred: red

* 1 potato (I prefer yukon gold or red; russet also works)

* 1 carrot

* 1 pack of Upton's Naturals seitan

**Instructions**

1. In saucepan, and salt.  Reduce heat to the point that the water is just barely boiling. The rice and lentils will cook for about 30-40 minutes, to taste: periodically check to see if the water has evaporated too much before the time is up. If so, add more, until about the last 5-10 minutes of cooking (you want the water to evaporate eventually).

2. While rice and lentils are boiling, potato, carrot, and garlic. Heat olive oil in large frying pan. Add potato, carrot, pepper, and onion. Stir-fry for about two minutes. Then add seitan and garlic. Cook until vegetables are lightly browned.

3. About five minutes before the rice and lentils and done cooking

4. Once rice and lentils are done and the water is mostly evaporated or absorbed

**Notes**

This dish is fairly flexible. The seitan isn't necesary if you have trouble finding it. Also

I prefer not to peel the potato,False,self,t5_2s5ei,1374173287.0,,,t3_1ikpjb

Almost fills a 500g pb jar

1/2 c unsweetened soy milk

1 1/8 c canola oil

1 - 1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice or white vinegar

1/2 - 3/4 tsp salt

Put everything in the blender and process until thick. In the Vitamix this takes about 10-15 seconds.

Note - don't sub in olive oil for canola - I did and the flavour is too strong.

EDIT - there is a lot of discussion here about needing an emulsifier.  I can only say, it can't help but emulsify.  I would be interested to hear if anyone else tries this recipe - nothing else added - and if it works for them.",,False,self,t5_2s5ei,1373806828.0,,

**Chocolate Chip Cookies**

* 1 tbsp ground flax seed
*  4 pitted dates
*  1 1/2c. walnuts
*  1/2c. pecans
*  1 tsp baking soda
*  salt
*  2 tbsp coconut oil (melted)
*  1 tsp vanilla
* 1/4c. unsweetened shredded coconut
*  1/4c. vegan chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 350F.  Mix 3tbsp water with your ground flax seed and set aside (this will be your ""egg"").  In a food processor, then enjoy!

Notes:  I've only ever made this with the flax seed as an egg replacer, cranberries, raisins...why not?  You could probably use different kinds of nuts too, I've replaced the pecans with almonds and it turned out just fine.

Cookies:
In a food processor pulse flour, salt, and baking soda to combine. (This can be done by hand too. It's just needs to be a very fine powder by the time it's done.) Add margarine, milk, vanilla, and mint. Pulse a few more times until the mixture comes together. Transfer to large bowl and knead with hands until it comes together and all the flour is incorporated. Chill the dough for 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silpats. Remove dough from refrigerator. Roll a heaping tsp of cookie dough into a ball and place onto prepared sheets leaving about 3 inches between each ball. Evenly flatten the dough with your fingertips so that it is about 1/4 inch thick and bake for 12-14 minutes. Let cool completely. 


Chocolate Coating:
Melt chocolate chips and margarine in a double boiler or microwave. Stir in mint extract and mix until completely smooth. Dip completely cooled cookie into the chocolate and remove with a fork,False,self,t5_2s5ei,False,,,t3_tn94y

The Flower Boy

http://imgur.com/A7JITFP

Wonton:
1 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
¼ cup Soymilk
½ cup water

Filling:
2 cups kale
½lb of Yves Veggie Ground
¼ of an onion finely chopped
4 tablespoons of Taco Seasoning
2 teaspoon Smart Balance Light with Flaxseed oil.
Oil: Vegetable 

Items you’ll need:
2 mixing bowls
1 small bowl
1 pan
1 sauce pan
Cutting board or baking sheet
Dough Roller (I used a cup to flatten the dough)
2 handtowels/kitchen cloths
1 medium cup	
Measuring utensils 


1.	In a bowl bring together flour, and mix well ( I cheated and used a blender which made the mixture fluffy) In another bowl combine soymilk and water. Pour the water soymilk combo slowly into the four mixture kneading as you go. Your dough should not me super wet/dry. If it is add flour/water til it’s easier to manage. Put aside dough bowl after kneading.  Place a cloth over it and let it sit for 10-15 minutes.
2.	Prep your onion, Yves veggie ground and heat up until onions have caramelized and become soft. Put in the taco seasoning and add ¼ cup of water, mix and coat evenly. By now your saucepan should be ready, add the kale and take out of water when wilted. 
3.	Kale prep: After finishing cooking (water is probably green) drain water. Bring out your second hand towel and put kale on it. Roll the kale like you make sushi
4.	When the veggie ground taco mixture and the kale is cooling down. Take the dough and roll it onto a floured surface (cutting board or baking sheet). Start at the dough with a rolling pin, cut out 6 circle pieces. 
5.	Bring the kale and veggie ground taco mixture together and combine. On the cookie sheet distribute mixture evenly to each wonton circle. Fold in half and pinch close. Think pie edges when pinching them
6.	When your finished take out another pan (or wash the one you used) and add a palm size amount of oil in pan. Swirl around and heat until oil is hot. 
7.	Take out your small bowl and add the butter to it

Marinade the pieces in vinegar, and then about a teaspon of maple syrup, but really this isn't an exact science).  Let them sit in the vinegar stuff for an hour or so then drain and pat dry.  

Now throw the cucumber in a baking dish (*toss in oil and spice) and throw said baking dish in a 450 F oven for 30-45 minutes.

I wanted to try a new recipe for supper tonight. So early this afternoon I made these burger buns. 

http://www.holycowvegan.net/2011/09/whole-wheat-burger-buns.html

Although they are time consuming

Then I made up a burger recipe with what I had available. The result was pretty spectacular. My wife and daughter who are very picky eaters both enjoyed the results! So I wanted to come here to share. I hope you enjoy. 

---------------------------------------------
Makes approximately 10 burgers. Can be cooked and frozen for later use. 

    2 tsp garlic powder
    1/2 tsp cumin
    1 tsp turmeric
    1 tsp sea salt
    1 tsp onion power 
    1 tsp smoked paprika
    
    8 dashes liquid smoke (optional) 
    1 12oz block silken tofu (extra firm) 
    2 C chickpeas
    1 C oats
    1 1/2 C rice flour
    
    1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil (for frying)
    
Puree the chickpeas in food processor. Add the tofu and blend together. In a separate bowl mix together the spices. Add the spices and remaining ingredients to the food processor and blend until even. The mixture will be very moist. Add olive oil to frying pan and preheat pan on medium heat. My suggestion is to drop a **large** spoonful into your preheated pan. Once the bottom starts to brown

**Vegan Cooking Utensils:**

* Quality Chef's Knife - Since you'll be chopping vegetables pretty much 24/7

* Food processor / Blender - This opens up all the wonderful worlds of hummus, dips, aioli, and countless other dishes you can only truly make well with the power of machines!

* Cast Iron Pan - You want to sear some tofu? Perfectly grill seitan? Make insane home fries? You pretty much need a cast iron pan! Proper care and maintenance is also important. 

* [Nut Milk Bag](http://www.amazon.com/Nut-Milk-Bag-New-Improved/dp/B00158U8DU) Essential for making almond milk and straining cashews and other types of delicious things.

**Know Your Vegetables**

I feel like when people make the lifestyle change to vegetarian/vegan they eschew the beauty of vegetables for the ease of tofu pups and daiya. Since we eat a plant-based diet we really need to be experts on what grows in the ground. I suggest loading up Youtube and watching as many episodes of Good Eats as possible to learn the exact science

**Replacing Eggs:**

We have a few options here and it depends on what you're doing.

* **Ground Flax Seed** (1 TBS + 2 TBS water = 1 egg) - This has an amazing eggy consistency that produces a lot of volume but also a nutty flavor. This is great when making cookies, but be aware that it does add a nutty flavor which may not always be desirable. Also Omega 3's are awesome and flax has a buttload.

* **[Egg Replacer](http://www.ener-g.com/gluten-free/egg-substitute.html)** - Great for not leaving any noticeable taste but doesn't have as much volume as the flax. Follow the instructions on the box and use a whisk to get better volume. Try not to make too watery.

* **Apple Sauce** (1/4 cup applesauce PLUS 1/2 teaspoon Baking Powder = 1 egg) - A healthy alternative that can be used in recipes requiring a sweet touch. The volume isn't as good as the flax

* **Tofu** - This is perfect for making tofu scramble, mustard, or nutritional yeast for coloring and flavor. Also smoked salt makes for an amazing eggy taste that tofu absorbs quite well.

**Replacing Milk**

There are so many different kinds of milk substitutes out there

* **Soy Milk** - To me this is the thickest and best used if you need a lot of texture in baking or making a sauce. When cooking savory make sure to get unsweetened. I try not using soy milk because there is already so much soy in everything.

* **Almond Milk** - My personal favorite. A little less viscous than soy milk but it makes it up in taste. I love using it in cereal and also when making pancakes and waffles.

* **Rice Milk** - I don't have a lot of experience with it

**Replacing Meat**

* **Tofu** - One could write a novel about tofu. There is a lot to discuss when exploring the wonderful world of soy bean blocks and all their potential tastiness. First and foremost is prep. Draining tofu can be a pain, wrap each piece generously in paper towels, place them between 2 plates, then put a heavy object on top. A tea kettle half full of water does the trick. Wait 20 minutes or so and you got some tofu ready to suck up any flavor you got. Freezing tofu overnight will deplete the water even further, but is not necessary. 

* **Tempeh** - Tempeh can be a little tricky. If not cooked enough it has the potential to make you sick and give you an upset stomach. When I buy tempeh in the store I try and cut it as thin as possible and then fry it until it's a deep golden brown. If it's cooked enough you're good to go and it's a great way to break up the monotony of eating tofu!

* **Seitan** - Seitan is a god send. It's not made of soy and you can make it in bulk. You can make 3lbs of it and freeze huge chunks for months. The [Post Punk Kitchen - Vegan With a Vengeance Recipe](http://www.theppk.com/2009/11/homemade-seitan/) is pretty much the standard. There are a million ways to cook seitan which you will find out there in the internet. I personally love making the PPK version then marinating it in BBQ sauce overnight. Fry it/grill it

Saffron - to taste and budget. A few threads.

Rose water: 1/2 cup

1 cardamom pod (optional)

1/2 cup soymilk or almond milk

1 cup pistachio kernels or pistachio kernel pieces - I get a bag of kernels from Trader Joe's for $5.99 and it lasts for several quarts of this recipe)

1 quart vanilla soy ice cream (I use Trader Joe's Soy Creamy Vanilla - $3.49)

1 tsp sugar (any coarse sugar; this will be used for grinding the saffron)

Directions:

1) Put your saffron threads in a mortar. Add a tiny amount of sugar and grind with the pestle. (Optional: grind a pod of cardamom seeds into it as well. I do this

If you have an ibrik or a tiny, move to 2b.

2a) Pour into an ibrik. (I bought mine from World Market - $20) Pour soymilk on top of the dry mixture. Heat until hot. DON'T LEAVE THE IBRIK! If you have one

2b) Pour the spice mixture and soy milk into a cup. Microwave for a minute or until hot. Take it out and stir it. Leave it be for 5 minutes. Move on to step 3.

3)Empty ice cream into a bowl. Stir rosewater into the saffron milk. Mix this mixture with the ice cream; blend it well to distribute it evenly. Stir in pistachios or pistachio pieces. Enjoy or freeze to enjoy later!

So I wanted to create a dish that had a real meaty quality but staying vegan. My roommates and I are newish to the vegan diet and we have pretty high expectations on food. This came together really well last night.

Roasted Green Beans

* 2 heads of broccoli
* 12oz green beans
* 1 red bell pepper
* 12oz white button mushrooms
* 2 tsp olive oil
* 1 tsp of salt
* 1 block tempeh
* 1 tbs tomato paste
* 1 cup red wine
* 2tbs soy sauce
* 2 tbs worcestershire sauce
* 2 tbs balsamic vinegar
* 1 tsp dry thyme
* 1tbs chopped fresh rosemary
* 1tbs chopped fresh parsley
* 2tbs coconut oil/vegetable oil
* 1 tbs flour
* 1 onion
* 2 carrots
* 2 ribs celery
* 4 cups vegetable stock (If you were ever going to do home made

* 1.5 lb sweet potato
* 1/4 cup smart balance vegan margarine
* 2tbs brown sugar
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/4 cup almond/soy milk

* 1 loaf french bread
* 1/3 cup vegan margarine
* 6 cloves garlic minced
* 1 tsp salt
* fresh black pepper
* 1 tbs chopped parsley (fresh)

 Heat the pan and the oil and saute the mushrooms until well browned. Add 1/2 cup red wine, you're supposed to be pan-frying the tempeh at this point. If when you're getting color on the tempeh you have a more than 2 tbs of oil in the pan, simply pour out the excess oil.)
Once the tempeh begins to color

While the sauce is simmering bring all the sweet potato ingredients together in a small pot to a simmer and cover. cook over low stirring occasionally until they come apart

Heat your oven to 450. Put a sheet pan in the oven to preheat. Toss the broccoli

For the garlic toast

To plate: Sweet potatoes go in the center with the roasted vegetables and the sauce poured over.

Enjoy!

I'm sorry the ingredients are out of order

I tend to thrive on simplicity. For example
I don't have any food allergies that I know of.

What I'm looking for here is help constructing a simple

Breakfast seems simple. Lately I've been going for Quakers oatmeal with banana

Snacks are trail mix (homemade: almonds, raisins, and sunflower seeds.), hummus (with carrots, broccoli, bell peppers), avocado with chips and salsa (recommendations?)

Lunches seem to be a combination of the snacks above with an almond butter and something sandwich or leftovers from dinner. Are there any good fruit spreads (ie no HFCS, any good whole grain (wheat but willing to try other grains) bread brands? If I'm home instead of packing a lunch I will sometimes go for rice, beans, and avocado with tortilla chips.

Dinners have the most room for variation it seems. I like to have a green leafy salad for starters (spring mix, brown rice, or quinoa. I can sprinkle on some nutritional yeast for B12. Is there a baseline set of vegetables I can/should use to always get all the nutrients I need? I have also taken a liking to cooking whole grain pasta, using some spices mixed in with some organic tomato sauce and again tossing in whatever veggies are lying around. On the more processed side, Dr. Praegers veggie burgers have grown onto me.

I feel lucky that I don't really crave most animal products any more. Desserts are more fruit (blackberries!!) or some dark chocolate.

Thanks in advance!

* A beer
* 5 or 6 canned chipotles in adobo sauce
* A couple tablespoons of tomato paste
* Half an onion
* A few cloves or garlic
* Vegetable bouillon 
* 2 drained cans of young
* Salt and pepper to taste

And then... Put the first 5 ingredients in a blender and liquefy them.  Add them to a sauce pan with the jackfruit and bouillon.  Bring it to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for an hour, cilantro, and avocado, but you know... whatevziez.)  Et voila.  You're done.  This makes enough for probably about a dozen tacos.  So if you want less, just halve the recipe.   

I forgot to take a picture

And really... you can just wing this with what you have on hand.  I had the onion, and chipotles already so that's what I used.  But you could really use water and whatever your mexican seasonings of choice are or just whatever you have on hand.  Next time I think I'll try roasted fresh chilis and then some toasted, ground dried chilis with maybe a little cumin instead of the chipotles in adobo.  I'll probably add some oil, too.  These were good, but could have been improved by some fat.  And remember, these are tacos, not angel food cake.  It's going to be hard to screw these up.
