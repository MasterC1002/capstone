1372195674.0,1h2c8b,My 25 very useful tips and tricks for backcountry backpacking,DonTago,223,28,62,"I have done a lot of backcountry camping/hiking, I would love to hear more from everyone else out there.

* **1:** On cold nights in your tent

* **2:** If you run out of mosquito repellent

* **3:** Always carry extra trash bags with you. Not only are they light and can be filled with trash

* **4:** Another Nalgene trick, use it as instant moleskin or just use it to pull cheat grass spines out of your socks.

* **5:** Telescoping hiking poles, river-fording, fighting off nuisance animals and most importantly reduce the impact on your legs, knees, ankles, and feet.

* **6:** Remember when you pack away your food at night into a bear-bag, moisturizers, insect sprays, etc. Animals are curious and may investigate any foreign smell, even if it is not food.

* **7:** Those thick plastic packages with zippers that are used as packaging for bed sheet-sets you get at the home-dept at box-stores make *great* make-shift dry-bag containers for packing toiletries or nick-knacks in the top of backpack. Because really

* **8:** When packing your pack, while placing heavy items at the bottom can throw off your center of gravity and could affect your ability to balance properly.

* **9:** Not drinking tons of water before going to bed and peeing before bed help keeps you warmer thru the night. Your body will waste great amounts of energy to first bring all that water up to body temperature and then keep it at that temperature all night long.

* **10:** Attach alligator or binder clips to the top of your pack

* **11:** One way you can lighten your load is to carry high-calorie foods. Suppose you need 12, dried apricots, nuts and cheese will give you thrice as many calories as bread, fresh vegetables or chips.

* **12:**  Freeze Dried Meals are very expensive

* **13:** Collect the lint from your dryer in a small plastic bag. It makes for a great kindling when attempting to start a fire. It is lightweight and catches easily.

* **14:** Do not spend a ton of money on a tent footprint

* **15:** Instead of carrying an expensive custom camp-pillow

* **16:** If you are using a pump filter for water

* **17:** Paint all your cooking pots with flat-black stove paint. A blackened pot will absorb heat faster than a shiny surfaced one. This will reduce the amount of fuel you use per meal.

* **18:** Do not attempt major hiking trips with new boots. If blisters or sore areas develop on your feet b/c of new boots

* **19:** If a lot of rain is expected, if you have room.

* **20:** Bungee cords have a million uses, they can be invaluable. 

* **21:** There is a lot of snobbery when it comes to the age-old sleeping bag debate: synthetic vs. down. But at the end of the day, buy down.

* **22:** I have personally found that the egg-carton foam [Thermarest](http://www.rei.com/product/829826/therm-a-rest-z-lite-sol-sleeping-pad) sleeping pads are the best. You don't have to fuss with inflating them or worry about getting holes in them. Also

* **23:** Backpacks come with huge amounts of extra long straps and even straps and buckles you don't need. Figure out what is useful and fits your needs

* **24:** Carry a whistle with you. It is good for scaring bears and essential when you get lost from a partner or in the wilderness. Also, it helps alert them to your presence. The last thing you wanna do is startle a bear with her cubs.

* **25:** Don't solely rely on technology. Be prepared and educated on how to find your way without the help of a cell-phone or GPS,,False,self,t5_2qpcz,1372206423.0,,True

1360865405.0,18izfv,"Giving it all up to backpack the world. Where should I start? S. America, Thailand, or US?",ElusiveReverie,60,58, and leave my home behind.

I'm a man in my late-20s, and have been to Mexico once for a vacation. I hike and backpack locally frequently.

I'm trying to figure out if I should explore my home country or branch out. I've got a few thousand USD saved

Thailand has the advantage of being cheap from what I understand. I can stretch a dollar a long way. I can also travel to Australia or up through Asia into Europe by mostly-foot. Though I'd have to start with a flight which cuts out a non-trivial amount of my savings. (~$600) Not to mention having to check baggage which I'm not too fond of.

South America (Brazil &amp; Chile specifically) has the advantage of being reachable by foot alone and I know enough Spanish to get by. I'm a little hesitant about crossing the US-Mexico border

Of course, and the potential to provide a whole new outlook from the eyes of a backpacker around places I've already been.

What do you guys suggest? Any relevant advice?",self,t5_2qpcz,1360865731.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/18izfv/giving_it_all_up_to_backpack_the_world_where/

I was there for two weeks, and it was absolutely amazing, even though my backpack was heavier than I thought it would.

* Plan on camping near rivers and lakes.
* Possibly going by myself or with 1-2 others.

I have my pack already. It's a 65L (extendable to 75) Deuter pack

* I've pretty much decided on a tent

* I'm torn on sleeping bags. I know down is the warmest and the most compact and lightweight (all ideal) but I also know that moisture and use can drastically reduce the loft and the overall performance. The bulk and weight of synthetics

* Clothing is probably my least informed area. I know cotton is ill-advised, but want to be prepared to spend the majority of my time walking. Can anyone over advice into the types of clothes that would be best; durability, comfort, least chafing, waterproof/resistance, etc?

* I plan to be in and out of, I have not yet purchased any equipment to store and carry water. While I'll have access to these resources, I don't want to be in and out of towns, stores and etc all the time so I do plan to carry a few days supplies at a time. Does anyone have recommendations for containers to carry water?

* Any other gear

***


There are a lot of motivations and inspirations behind this trip: some of it is just wanting to travel

I think we are, not changes led or enforced by religions or governments and I think a lot of it depends on individuals making the effort to engage each other differently and more positively. Along my journey I want to talk to people about the future, about how we can make it better - not how we can make government make it better, or how we can get this group or that religion to make improvements - but how WE can make it better. And I want to make life, even if just for that moment or day or whatever, better for those I come in contact with through words, actions

I began preparing for my trip in 2010 after I graduated college and decided I didn't want to get a real job yet. I worked at Starbucks

1. **Roundtrip Flight** LAX&lt;--&gt;Heathrow $820 STAtravel.com (you pay a $30 membership fee and you need a university ID

2. **Eurail Global Pass** for 2 months of consecutive travel days. If you plan to cross the English Channel, now it's about $1100 http://www.eurail.com/eurail-passes/global-pass

3. **50L Travel Pack** from REI. $129.99 (This is the link to the newer version: http://www.rei.com/product/809156/rei-grand-tour-85-travel-pack-mens) There are 3 compartments. The bottom compartment was used for dirty clothes. Also included is a detachable day pack. 

4. **NorthFace Waterproof Jacket.** Something durable and waterproof for those travel days it might be raining. $80

5. **Hostels.** Get the Hostel Hero and Hostel World apps. If you plan on kind of planning this trip on the fly, paris, brussels, berlin, zurich, rome, florence, then use the app to book the others when you think you know when you want to arrive and leave. You will stay in cool hostels and you will stay in borderline sketchy hostels. Take it in stride and pay attention and read the ratings from the apps I listed. They give great insight. Take a Sleep Sheet http://www.rei.com/product/627255/cocoon-cotton-bag-linertravel-sheet
This will allow you to not have to pay to rent sheet from some hostels that don't provide them. They usually charge 3-5 Euros. 

6. **Food.** Most hostels offer continental breakfasts. LOAD UP AND EAT THIS ""FREE"" MEAL. This will save you so much money. This way you won't be hungry til about 3 or 4 and you can manage most days on 2 full meals a day (leaves more money for alcohol ;)) My meals mostly consisted of baguettes, Lidl, Billa are the most common.) and cook in the hostel. Some hostels have kitchens to use at your disposal. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_supermarket_chains

7. **Alcohol.** Wine is UNBELIEVABLY CHEAP in Europe. In Paris I bought a 5 year old Bordeaux for 6 Euros at a local convenience store. In Italy it's embarrassingly cheap...obviously. Be weary of hostel-run pub crawls. Usually they get a cut of the initial charge and the drinks suck. It's best to ask about bars in the area and explore with your hostel-mates. 

8. **Best events of my trip.** Renting a Vespa in Siena

9. **Safety.** You will get a certain vibe from every hostel as soon as you walk in. I bought zipper locks for my backpack [Zipper Locks](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/9725907599102514207?hl=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=small%20locks%20for%20backpacks&amp;oq=small+locks+for+backpacks&amp;gs_l=serp.3...13294.13671.2.13797.5.5.0.0.0.2.122.396.3j2.5.0...0.0...1c.1.7.psy-ab.QO507D6FGYI&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2

because when you go out
(something conspicuous and not huge [Bike Lock](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/403814320875697102?q=bike%20locks&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;bav=on.2
and locked my backpack to my bed or bunk. Have a fanny pack (dont call it that when you're over there

**Documents.** I made copies of: reservations for hostels that I made before the trip, it's usually $5 per withdraw, no matter the amount. Chase does not charge international fees but also you want to be careful in leaving cc information with sketchy hostels or businesses. So use your best judgement. Best bet is to withdraw money for 3 or 4 days or if longer, about half of your stay per respective currency.) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_ATM_Alliance

**Things to take:** Locks- for lockers if provided by hostel, 2 pairs of shorts, 4 t shirts, 2 collared shirts, 6 pairs of socks, sandals, walking shoes, 8 pairs of underwear. Now you may be thinking that's a lot. BUY SPACE SAVER BAGS!!! They were my lifesaver. A Large and Medium size should do just fine. Passport (obviously)

**Souvenirs:** I took a freezer size bag and told myself I had to fit everything in that bag. I brought back bar coasters, museum pamphlets, basically anything that was made of paper. Those are the real souvenirs.

**General Advice:** I hope you are taking some kind of wifi device. I would definitely invest in a used ipod touch if you dont have one. I took my iphone and just used it for wifi. The Hostel Hero and Hostel World apps are AMAZING. Be sure and visit small towns that you may not have thought about. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE put Leuven

Bring along your favorite songs that make you feel inspired. I put together a Europe playlist on my iPhone that consisted of folky acoustic, and just other thought-provoking music. Also a great thing to share with people you meet. 

When in Florence stay at http://www.plushostels.com/pluscampingmichelangelo. You stay in a tent with actual beds looking down on the City of Florence and there is a cheap convenience store on the premises as well as a restaurant that serves the best pizza for 5 Euros. Buy a bus ticket at the train station at what looks like a souvenir shop window. You can take the number 12 or 13 bus (they both get you there) and it's the stop after Piazza Michelangelo (about 20 min bus ride). When you are able

You are going to meet so many amazing people on trains, a funny quote, etc. I still go through it and remember the awesome time I had. Your time over there is going to go by so fast, you want a way to look back. I took my Canon 7D and came back with 128GB worth of photos and video footage. I made a highlight video of every city my friend and I visited, you can check it out here https://vimeo.com/28495918

1. No hotels. All of my sleeping will be done on overnight trains. Using a sleeper car counts as cheating. As such, and what can I buy as I need it?
2. No flying. Land and sea based transportation only. With that in mind, but I'm sure I can make do with anything else.
3. Never have more than 200 USD worth of currency on my person at any given time. Because of that, switching currency, or needing to stock up on supplies. Can anyone help on that?

Other Information

I'll be starting in Columbus, what's a good city to start with from there? I'm mostly going to be traveling on a ""cheapest overnight train that's going somewhere new"" itinerary, but I'd like to kick off my adventure somewhere good. Further, when I finally get over to Europe, what are some good cities to shoot for?

So with all that in mind, I can cut the cost of hotels out of the equation, but I'm still not entirely sure how much I'll need other than that it'll be something of the order of several thousands of dollars.

1. I'm a 24 year old male
2. I live in New York
3. My budget is 8
4. I will be traveling alone (and have done a couple solo trips before in Paris and Argentina
5. I am an Asian American



So these are the 3 places I'm trying to choose between



**Australia / NZ**

Pros:

* English speaking - makes traveling easier
* Great Beaches in Australia for surfing
* Great Hiking in New Zeland
* Lots of other backpackers I could meet
* Could go to ""Splendour in the Grass"" which seems like an awesome music festival

Cons:

* Its winter in Australia - maybe not the best time to go?



**Peru**

Pros

* Can hike Macchu Picchu
* Can go surfing on the beach
* Rainforest
* I speak spanish
* Much cheaper

Cons

* Maybe not as safe to travel alone
* Probably could do in a week from New York


**Eastern Europe (Austria, &amp; Hungary)**

Pros:

* Beautiful countries
* I think easiest to travel around
* Lots of backpackers to meet

I am tossing up between a [One Planet](http://www.oneplanet.com.au/travel/longreach.html) (they are aussie and the quality of their bags seems to be second to none) and an [Osprey](http://www.ospreypacks.com/en/product/backpacking/waypoint_85_-_mens).

The Osprey is higher spec in that it has more pockets

My worry is that I am not the most caring person when it comes to my belongings and the bag will be knocked around a fair bit. There is also a good chance it will get wet at some point so a fair amount of water proofing would be useful (without a rain cover).


So Osprey owners: has you pack ever broken? Any clips broken? Any tears?
And how is the water proofing? If I get caught in a downpour will my stuff get wet in an Osprey bag?

**EDIT** 

Thanks for all the replys everybody! It has been super helpful! I decided to go with the Osprey Waypoint 85 even though you all said it is too big.

Should I schedule more nights in other bigger cities? I figure when I'm in Den Haag I'll visit Delft since it's close by

Also, France is not apart of the deal, so that makes things complicated. If I were to fly into Edinburgh, traverse south to London (using the Eurail??), then taking the chunnel to Paris, train to Angers, train to Antwerpen, then Berlin

At this point

For instance if you and your wife/SO are going backpacking dont buy a two person tent, buy a three person tent, especially if the weight diff. is small.  Most people end up taking a lot of crap inside the tent which can crowd things.  If you think you can handle keeping most of your stuff outside the by all means go lighter and get the two person version.  I'm all for lighter!

7.[Folding saw](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IAZDAO/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;cloe_id=50d3dc8b-6451-4d92-881f-a381520b483f&amp;attrMsgId=LPWidget-A1&amp;pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=B000EI0W0Q&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=00N8692ZCPYQMTFET5EP)  Don't bring an axe bring a pruning saw!!!  I can't stress this enough.  You will waste so much energy chopping through wood with an axe, don't bother cutting through the whole thing.  When we camp we have two people sawing logs, and one person jumping on the slices we make.  Firewood comes very quickly.  =P  

8.[sleeping pad](http://www.rei.com/product/778146)  Do not EVER go backpacking without one.  Even if it is just a foam pad.  The comfort level skyrockets with very little weight added.  Oh and i you are trying to introduce someone to backpacking let THEM use the pad.  Otherwise

1358341978.0,16olei,Looking for 30 L Backpack - What to look for &amp; Suggestions,sixtyfootersdude,15,4,27,"Looking for a 30 L backpack.  Want it primarily for: 

* Taking the train/bus for weekend trips in nearby cities
* Maybe light weekend overnight in the backcountry 
* Maybe an extended trip in Europe in the next couple years

Features: 

* Top loading - I am able to cram way more stuff into a top loader and packing seems much more flexible.  
* Comfortable hip straps - Even on my 10 L the hip straps are key to my happiness
* Able to carry a variable load - I don't always have exactly 30 L of stuff.  I would like to be able to carry the bag empty or half full and still have it be comfortable 
* Good back support.  

------------

Examples of what I am considering: 

**[MEC Spirit 30 Daypack](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/Packs/Daypacks/TopLoad/PRD~5024-833/mec-spirit-30-daypack.jsp)**

I actually bought this bag and used it for a weekend but am planning on returning it because of the following problems.  

* The hip strap is very uncomfortable.  It does not distribute weight well and is very sharp.  

* The bag doesn't carry 15 L of gear very well.  The two cinch straps will only tighten up the bottom 2/3 of the bag.  This leaves the top half uncinched and flopping around.  The bag doesn't hold its shape when it is not full. The back will bend.  Maybe something with a stronger more serious internal frame would help to address this..?

* The top zipper is very hard to close.  Very sticky.  Not sure if I have a defective bag or if it is poorly made.  

* The shoulder straps are too close together at the top of the back  unless you have an ultra thin neck this probably won't fit you.  


**[Black Diamond Speed 30 Daypack](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/Packs/Daypacks/TopLoad/PRD~5023-880/black-diamond-speed-30-daypack-unisex.jsp)**

* Looks more expandable.  Top can be filled or folded down
* Will try the hip belt to see if it is more comfortable.
* Had dynamic suspension.  Will need to try this out to see what it means or if it feels good.  


-----------

Side note: I have a [Mec Brio 70](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/Packs/WeekendAlpinePacks/PRD~4012-402/mec-brio-70-backpack.jsp) that has been great.  I guess what I am looking for is a big bag harness and frame on a little bag.  I don't mind a reasonable weight penalty.

packing: 

* you only need essentials. how essential this is is up to you. for example i met people with one set of clothing they washed in the sink every night.

* you will very very likely not need a sleepingbag

* i am fine without a second small bag, a knife and i keep a waterbottle in my hand.)

* get light trekking shoes. some you can also use for cycling/running and just sports in general. for the other 95% you'll probably wear flipflops or sandals. only take one of the previous

places to go:

* i met a lot of people who didn't like bangkok but others find it great. it's really hard to say.

* don't go directly from bangkok to chiang may

* if you go to laos, but you'll arrive in lauang prabang with a big group and you'll have a good time with them in the bowling alley.

* if you're in laos, but for the beauty of the mountains. stay in a bungalow on the other side of the river and just relax a few days.

* in the south go to the 4000 islands. don dett is a great hive for friendly backpackers and great to get a tan on.

* of course you have to visit ankor. you could push through it in a day

skams:

* you're in bangkok and it's buddha day? it's not. nothing is closed

* your tucktuck is ""only"" 100baht to the station? it should be more like 80. and no

* you travel by train and you're paying more than 300 baht? why did you buy the first class ticket? get second class

* if you buy something (except for electronics) that's the same price as in europe

* if you are considering booking something and want a night to think

* if you go to laos/thailand for less the 14 days it's free. don't pay 30$. and if you go to cambodia

dangers: 

* big fullmoon parties are VERY dangerous. watch for roofies and other drugs. even the guys. i met enough people who had blackouts after 2 or 3 drinks.

* watch you're stuff. it's not the asians on the street i worry about

* don't start a fight with an asian. he'll have more guys to back him up. usually they are very friendly

* malaria is an issue here

* drugs. don't try ""happy shakes"" when shrooms are involved and watch your barkeeper. ""what was that pill you just put in?"" -""MDMA""... also there are ""deet-cocktails"". cocktails with small amounts of insect repellent. people died just last week from that stuff. 

* deet95. it's the strongest insect repellent you can get

general advice:

* it's hard to stay alone. you'll always find someone with the same destination if you keep your eyes open. and traveling in pairs in cheaper

* watch your camera. you don't want to break it/loose it. vang vieng is a camera graveyard so don't take it tubing

* when you walk through a forest or ricefields always stomp a little. it scares the snakes away. 

* just because he's a monk doesn't mean he's not an asshole.

* don't buy souvenirs until you're getting to the end of your journey. you don't want them broken and every kilo of dead weight is annoying.  

* laos currently has a curfew

* don't take a whole laptop. netbooks are the best, you can just go to the next internet cafe. as a young backpacker it is nice to keep my family updated often enough, as they are a little worried. it depends on you, but a laptop is just dead weight",,False,self,1354266525.0,t3_141han

A buddy of mine and I were planning a trip up north on the Lost Coast Trail.  Plans are just not coming together for this tip.

Every ranger I've talked to says pushing a pace of 8miles per day on the sand is really moving.  Neither of us have any experience hiking or camping on the beach so we're a bit nervous of parking one car at one end and another at the other end and jumping in and committing to the whole 25miles without knowing what we're getting into.

So we planned on making a shorter trip

So.  That leaves us with 2 choices.  hiking in/out which to me seems kinda lame.  OR saddling up on a different trail.  We are starting out in the Bay Area so anything within 2-3 hours drive north/south of there would be awesome.  We'd like to do some beach trails and camping to give us a better idea of what we're getting into with the Lost Coast Trail which we plan on doing later when it's a bit more feasible.

TLDR:  Friend and I are nervous to do the 25mile Lost Coast Trail in 2 nights.  Looking for alternative 15-20 mile beach trail that will give us a better gauge of our ability and pace hiking in the sand.

1375979918.0,1jyqjc,Pros and Cons list: Solo backpacking across Europe,Red217,15,6,10,"Hey all! 

I need your help. I'm hoping that the title is pretty self explanatory as far as what I am about to ask. I would love to plan a backpacking trip across Europe. For those of you who have done it, I would LOVE (need) a list of the pros and cons of both. 

I would like to say that I did my best to research a post related to this topic specifically

Anywho, I know my list(s) will potentially be lacking, and so that is where I need all you veterans to throw your two cents in! 

Traveling SOLO:

Cons (that I'd imagine)-
--Being a young 20 something female
--Staying in hostels that are creepier than what I'd like to stay in alone
--Being lonely/not having anyone to immediately share my ""in awe"" reactions
--Not having anyone to talk to 24/7
--safety
--getting homesick more easily

Pros:
--I can move
--I can eat when and where I want without having to take extra time to ""figure out what we want to eat that we all agree on""
--I can see/do only the things I want
--I don't have to give  up sights I want to see to accommodate the rest of the group
--I don't have to see sights I don't want to see to accommodate the rest of the group. 
--I don't have to worry about ""getting sick of"" the people I'm traveling with. (You know what happens when you spend too much time with someone you've NEVER spent that much with with)

Okay

A few of the things I listed may seem selfish

I'm really interested in hearing your input on this! For those who have made a trip like this, even if you have something to add.

If you have any ideas about the following options

**Road Trip USA:** I've always wanted to drive from New York, and then through California--already have the itinerary planned (many national parks and iconic American landscapes). I have friends I could stay with in South Carolina and California, but I worry about making friends in other places. I imagine trucking through South Carolina --&gt; LA solo might get lonely.

**Crazy Hiking Expedition** Something completely off the wall, or the John Muir trail. I feel like these could be the most fulfilling, but also the loneliest. 

**Stay home:** Stay home,000), and do day-trips on the weekends. 

**Working Holiday, I'd find a summer position at a place that hopefully hires other young people, and explore the countryside. I'd also be able to visit my friends in the UK. Additionally, a friend may come with me for this trip. Downside? I've already been through Ireland from Dublin to Dingle, and rain isn't my favourite thing.
