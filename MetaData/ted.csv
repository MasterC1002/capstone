I have them in a 5 star ranking system in iTunes (with half stars), a life changer, something fascinating to ponder or something utterly original, a 4 1/2 is pretty close to that, a 4 is something overwhelmingly interesting or readily worthwhile to share, a 3 1/2 is something worth thinking about, though not necessarily in the exact form (i.e. maybe a topic worth looking into independently), a 2.5 is something that's perhaps a bit disappointing

Without further adieu (I'll update this hopefully as I watch more):

1327879792.0,p27o1,I've watched every TED talk. My opinion on TED ,Phlexonance,73,48,45,"I've seen every talk
I find fewer and fewer to be worthwhile. Maybe the quality has declined or it could be that my standards have increased. Probably the latter.    

Many talks are full of buzzwords but devoid of a message. Many talks are about the insecurity of the speaker and subsequently turn into ""look how awesome I am. Apploud! ""      
Some talks are done by awful public speakers and I won't watch.    
Some talks are about raising awareness about a problem and urging for action

I wonder whether TED talks have real world effects or are just a big  circlejerk. 

I still watch them all

If you wonder how one watches them all:   
Get the rss feed (hopefully it still contains them all)  and RSSowl to auto download them all + every new one.

Would you please recommend me some TED Talks? I know I can see Talks related to Global Issues

Here are some examples

* The limits of privacy on social networks

* Work in construction of human dignity

* The challenge of living with differences (among people)

* The power of transformation by reading

* Child work

* Violence

* The right to vote as a way to promote social transformations

* Development and environmental preservation

The topics are usually very broad so you we talk about its negative and positive sides.

Quotes are also a valuable tool that could give some extra points.
