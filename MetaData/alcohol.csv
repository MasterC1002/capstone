1326727527.0,ojcl7,I miss booze.,NakedTonyDanza,87,7,15,"tl;dr: Tell your bottle you love her tonight.

I miss booze.  When I was a kid I used to stutter, I stole a 1.75 liter bottle of Beefeater Gin from the country club I worked at (which became a habit), and started drinking assorted hard alcohol at school (which also became a habit).  It's been said that ""whiskey is the key that sets the monkey free"", and boy if that crazy little bastard didn't break me out of my shell and show everyone a good time.

Booze is also partially responsible for meeting the love of my life - she was attracted to the outgoing adventurous risk taking guy and fell in love with the inner nerd that never would have had the balls to ask her out.  Most of our funniest

Remember all of those awesome stories your grandparents told you?  And you know how you clean up your stories for kids?  Put 2 and 2 together.  Yup - your grandparents were boozing during all of those youthful adventures.  Your parents probably were too.  It's a long

But it helps for benign matters too.  Shitty jobs?  No problem.  The world's gone mad?  Great!  If it crashes down, and distill hard alcohol.  When they say it becomes a part of you, they're not just referring to the molecules.  Alcohol has personality.  Stick with it long enough and it takes on a life of its own, partially breathed by you.

I recall learning in college that the liver is the fastest regenerating organ in the body; you just have to give it a break every now and again from the nonstop abuse.  I'd liken that knowledge to teaching a novice computer user how to use regedit - it's just enough information given to someone that has just enough skill to royally fuck everything up.  Fueled by the somewhat errant knowledge that my liver would go back to normal after years of abuse if I'd just stop for a while kept me hammering it down with the general idea that I'd stop when I turned 30. 

On my 30th birthday my significant other and I got tatered at my party with the office hotties and had drunken debaucherous group sex.  That one never would have happened sober.  Maybe I forgot my self-promise to stop drinking after that.

And then last year after 17 years straight, but it's not like it was helping.  What this means though is that if I were to keep drinking the life expectancy goes to about a year.

I'm a firm believer in quality of life.  The candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long

A few things happened when I stopped - my male pattern baldness disappeared and my hair grew back so full and wild I look like Andrew Jackson.  My muscles (apparently atrophied) grew back on their own.  My blood pressure went back to normal.  Sex drive returned to teenage status.  A few other things.

Mentally is the bigger change.  Alcohol changed me, and it will get you laid; it's really underrated.  The stuttering is still gone.  The only thing that actually became worse is the short term memory.  But it is what it is.

It's generally at this point in the story that people tell you that it wasn't worth it - here's where it's supposed to become a cautionary tale.  But fuck that

Stopping drinking was like taking that friend of yours aside, and telling them you can't see them anymore.  It's depressing as hell.  Booze may be technically be an inanimate object, but it's still heart-wrenching.

So friends of alcohol, let your poor liver regenerate).

Cheers!",,t5_2qi6q,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/alcohol/comments/ojcl7/i_miss_booze/

Paul emails me back:

 *I apologize that you had this problem; the last thing we want to do is put bad product in the marketplace.  There are a few reasons why a can could go bad, please send me your address and I will reimburse you for the product.  Also, if you get a chance please give me a call, I would like to ask you a few questions, hopefully we can learn something that may help prevent this problem from reoccurring.  I appreciate the fact that you spent your money to try Whipahol and I want to do what I can to make sure you get your money's worth.*

* Grill 4 rashers of bacon until really crispy.

* Hand cut some chunky break for making french toast/eggy bread.

* When making the eggy part of the bread

* Soak the Bread until it is saturated

* Layer your bacon on the cooked (upwards facing) piece of toast. cover the bacon in grated cheese (and some hot sauce if you're into that

* Put the cooked side of your second piece of toast on top of the cheese and leave to sit for a second so the cheese starts to melt. 

* Then flip the whole damn thing over. Grate some cheese on the top side and leave it to melt while the under side of the sammich cooks. Once done

If you can get it, mebbe Canada as well). If you can't get it, I like to have root beer instead (harder to get in scotland/UK), but any soda will do really.

In 2009 I made a commitment to never buy the same bottle of liquor twice. It can be frustrating sometimes

I've gotten to the point now, so I wanted to see if you guys can spot any huge gaps, which I'm sure must be there. Here is a list of genres I've come up with looking through my past purchases (unfortunately half of my list is MIA at the moment, but hopefully I'm not missing too much):

* Whiskey (rye, Scotch, bourbon, honey)

* Vodka (various sources)

* Rum (dark, spiced, cachaca, aguardiente)

* Brandy/Congac/Brandy de Jerez

* Dark/sweet herbal digestifs (Jager/Unicum/etc)

* Light/dry herbal digestifs (*Chartreuse*/others?)

* Palinka/Rakia/Grappa/Slivovitz 

* Akvavit

* Moonshine/White Whiskey/Grain/Potcheen (Corn, etc) 

* Tequila (white

* Gin (Sloe)

* Sake/Soju

* Arak/Raki/Ouzo/Sambuca/Absinthe

Notes: I generally considering anything less than 30% ABV not really a liquor. Also, I tend to prefer to drink things neat or on the rocks, which excludes lots of extremely sweet liqueurs and mixed drinks (although that may be my next quest).

I feel like there are a lot of varieties of light digestif I'm missing, and when I looked up aguardiente to remember what country it was from, I found that pretty much every South American country has a distinct variety.

So

EDIT: 
Thanks all! Here are some ones you've suggested:

* Whiskey: Indian(Amrut), Suntory), Strait Wheat  (Bernheim), Oat (High West, Koval)
* Fenret
* Gins: Old Tom
* Pisco, Poire Williams, Apple Brandy
* Calvados
* Mextaxa
* Koshu Sake
* Pulque http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulque

Excited to start finding these :-)

So remember that bit about how I got off work earlier? It's been about two hours since I got off but I haven't taken my work shirt off yet. I took my pants off but to go to the store, and he's not wrong now. We hop in the car and drive off to Safeway. For the purposes of this story (and because it's the truth), I drive a 1980's Volvo station wagon that (admittedly) has a lot of trash in it -- fast food wrappers, empty soda bottles, etc. It kinda looks like I live in it...

So anywho, kind of jokingly to myself, how I would prove to the cashier that I'm sober if they give me any shit. As I'm walking towards the liquor, I start doing that thing where you touch your nose. A manager spots me and jokingly says ""doing a sobriety test?"". I laugh and tell him ""nah, I'm just messing around"" and go to grab my liquor. He walks off before I get on the aisle.

I get on the aisle, damn.""

Well apparantly that was enough for the manager to decide to follow me out to my car for whatever reason. The fake-sobriety-test, sees the shitty car. Sees the dog in the shitty car. Probably adds up even better now. Then I fumble with my keys a little bit (which I'm sure doesn't help my case) and unlock the door. As I open the door, two bits of trash fell out. Just what I needed to help my image. I scooped up the trash, tossed it back in the car and drove home. It wasn't until I started driving home that I realized how bad that all looked.

I just picked up the new Smirnoff Sorbet from the liquor store. Figured I'd try it out since I'm counting my calories to lose that winter fluff. LOL I opened it up and smelled it to see if it was going to be strong or not very flavorful so I knew what to expect. To my surprise it smelled just like a regular mango fruit type drink. If you really concentrate you can smell a hint of alcohol. The taste was pleasant as well. As someone who just started drinking again after a year or two off I did not need a chaser after this vodka. It tasted great, again very smooth liquor. If you have a girlfriend who you cannot get to drink with you BUY HER THIS! Or if you aren't a fan of alcohol flavor definitely pick this up. They have two other flavors as well. Guarantee you or whoever you get this for will enjoy it.

My favorite type of beer is the Belgian/Blue Moon type
I like clear liquors much more than darker ones. I enjoy a Long Island Iced Tea but I always feel silly and immature when I order one. I love amaretto and I like the taste of sweet, strong, and more adult than something like a Cosmo.

I know this post probably isn't the best written but I am a bit tipsy at the moment :P So

- I'll have to order three of them over the course of the night; so I'd prefer it not be insanely expensive.

As funny as this sounds, haha), who seems to appreciate finer alcohols. I decided I wanted to try again, in a similar fashion as someone like Hannibal.

My intentions aren't to drink just for the purpose of getting drunk. I've been to the college parties, but my goal isn't to get so wasted that I puke on my couch. Just a nice, fancy whisky or scotch or something, to have after dinner while watching Game of Thrones, you know?

So, that I'm going to try over this week. I know, I know, I should have come to you first, but I didn't think about asking reddit until my purchases had been made. I'm wondering if you all agree with what was suggested, where you would go next, and what you would recommend in general!

I was told to buy (and have now bought):

* Evan Williams Honey Whiskey
* Vanilla Rum + Vanilla Coke
* Blue Moon beer

How do those sound? Any specific foods I should eat with them? I feel so dumb, full glass of ice, and then fill with vanilla coke. The blue moon beer should be the whole thing in a bigger glass, along with an orange (kind of like a lemon slice in water).

Please

Ok so I am a pretty introverted and socially awkward guy with very low confidence, funny and social, it's quite bizarre really it's a complete change of personality. 

Now I'm more of a beer guy and the occasional scotch or wine however I have IBS and beer and wine really mess with my IBS so as an alternative I've been drinking a lot of vodka and energy drinks mixes

I have noticed that whenever I have these not only does my confidence level increase but my ""awareness"" levels also increase, I can for the life of me pick up any form of subtlety, at first I thought it was only a coincidence BUT I did an experiment and went one weekend without drinking any of these mixes and didn't notice any irregular levels of ""awareness"" and then the next time I went out(couple of weeks after that) had another one and surprise it came back!

1372288090.0,1h53dm,Drinking Beer in Egypt. (x-post r/beer),madhatter_13,15,4,1,"**Intro**

I've been doing a study abroad in Cairo, although there are a few locations where imported beer can be found, these are uncommon and expensive and not worth mentioning. (In the touristy coastal cities, this may be a little different).

Alcohol in Egypt is definitely under attack by the current Islamist government, however.

Beer itself is generally considered the least 'offensive' alcohol in Egypt - many Muslims who oppose the sale of liquor will tolerate beer.

*****

**The Breweries**

Most of the beer in Egypt is controlled by one company: Heineken. They brew several different brands of beer, originally founded in 1897 in Giza and now located in Obour City in northeast Cairo.

Al Ahram was nationalized in the 1960's under President Nasser and privatized again in 1997 under Mubarak. It was purchased by Heineken in 2002

There is another smaller and newer brewery called Egyptian International Beverages Company

I have also heard of [Al Masria](http://www.alibaba.com/showroom/almasria.html) brewery

*****

**The Beers**

*Heineken*

This is the same Heineken you will drink anywhere outside of Holland. It tastes like the Heineken I have had in Texas

*[Stella](http://i.imgur.com/MEgpfOZ.jpg)*

Stella is the preferred local beer. Some of the local bars are simply known as ""Stella bars."" The brand has been around for 115 years

No matter where you get your Stella

*[Sakara Gold](http://i.imgur.com/ApIAOCd.jpg)*

The major ""competitor"" to Stella

*[Sakara Weizen](http://i.imgur.com/rU7EAGc.jpg)*

Very hard to find

*[Sakara King](http://i.imgur.com/AuQpZQA.jpg)*

Sakara's ""high alcohol"" offering

*[Meister Max](http://i.imgur.com/VffNuvA.jpg)*

Meister Max is another high alcohol offering

******

**The Drinking Experience**

Decent bars in Egypt are few are far between, and you can smoke some shisha while drinking at many places. There are several 'baladi bars' downtown which combine belly dancing, Stella, shisha, music, and lots of begging for tips. These are fun to see once, and that's it. Actually, they suck.

The average price of a beer that I've paid in Cairo is around 15LE, while nicer restaurants will charge 30LE or higher. Don't bother drinking at a hotel bar or casino unless you're willing to pay with your right testicle and firstborn daughter.

There will be cigarrete smoke at every single bar in Cairo. ""No Smoking"" is almost impossible to find

Here's a [blog post](http://camelsandtacos.blogspot.com/2011/06/egyptian-beer-complete-list.html) I found which offers a little more detailed overviews of Egyptian beers

During that period


That is, I have recently found that I miss alcohol dearly, for some pretty good (I think) reasons. 


First


During the past two years, taverns, hole-in-the-wall eateries, etc, that I have desired to visit. My choice to abstain from drinking never prevented me from entering these places, but it did shorten most of the visits. After all, I can only graze for so long before I’ll begin to balloon into some sort of caricature of Governor Christie; a consequence I wish to avoid more than any associated with alcohol. 


I imagine that I have matured to the degree that I may now be able to prolong a drink sufficiently to fully appreciate my environment


Second, a Hefeweizen; a Pinot Noir from a Shiraz. Knowledge of alcohol appeals to my very core. I am a guy that once subscribed to Wine Spectator and, with a friend, during college, kept a long running review of beer varieties. 


And


Finally


I began abstaining from drinking two years ago


I am now about to transition again – from Washington, I think I will allow alcohol, in moderation, to reenter my life. 


I look forward to moving to Fredericksburg and socially embedding myself in the community in ways that I have not in D.C. I would like to have a regular watering hole

All of this may be written as if from the mind of a true alcoholic. You are a better judge than I. As this outlook’s owner


The bottom line is that I am financially stable in such a way that I should be really enjoying life. And perhaps I have not been doing so as much as I have let on. But I intend to change that ... in responsible

I have had plenty of practice but for some reason I tend to get shit faced wasted every time I drink. I do not become charming

A little about me...I am 5 foot 7

I will drink anything except tequila (taste) or rum (mildly allergic) but favor common light beer and good whiskey.

I used to drink 3-5 nights out of the week but do not do so anymore. However, after drinking, that I was not hungover.

When I get drunk I am the typical drunk. I get loud

1347782509.0,zyq4x,Guinness Punch:  Beer is bread.  This traditional Jamaican drink is an icing sandwich.,feylias,11,2,4,"I'm keeping this a text-post

I was watching the Britcom [""Chef!""](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009NSCU8/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i02) and heard about a miraculous bit of traditional [Jamaican cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaican_cuisine) called a [Guinness Punch](http://www.webtender.com/db/drink/5696) that involved sweetened condensed milk and Nutmeg.

I found several recipes and tried many of them.  Here's how I suggest making it (but YMMV):

**Ingredients:  Egg, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Guinness Stout**

Thoroughly beat an egg.

Add a halfcup or so of half-and-half, a tablespoon of cinnamon, and maybe some cocoa powder or vanilla extract.

Take a healthy swallow from a bottle of Guinness Stout and pour the rest in.  Mix it thoroughly (a blender would be favorite)

This tastes, but has the complexity that is concomitant with a stout.

I hear if you mix this in a certain way you can kill the aftertaste of Guinness.  I didn't pull it off and don't mind.

Is it good?  Brownie scouts would drink this stuff.  I suggest serving it instead of eggnog at your adult-beverage-friendly holiday party.

*edit:  Half-and-half

*Later edit:  You can make this more easily just by mixing Guinness Stout with eggnog and adding some seasoning.  ...if you want.",,t5_2qi6q,1357411422.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/alcohol/comments/zyq4x/guinness_punch_beer_is_bread_this_traditional/
