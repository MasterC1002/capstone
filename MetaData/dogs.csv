1365379372.0,1bvtt4,I love my broken dog.,Walkywalky,832,110,88,"I fell in love with him the moment I saw him. Chained to the same dilapidated barn he'd been chained to for the last year. He was skinny, but I had to do something. So I left. 

I came back with supplies. Large tweezers, towels, ointment, a brush, a giant bone and a bag of treats. He stood so scared, but so patient, while I plucked, rinsed, I just knew it. Once I finally finished

The next day, I saw a glimmer of light in his one good eye. So he came home. 

I had no idea what I was going to to with this dog. He was broken. He didn't know his name

People thought I was crazy. ""No one wants a broken dog"", sad, soul in this great big dog that wanted so desperately to love and be loved, to trust and be trusted. 

So I set about training him. Can you sit? Nope. Down? Nuh uh. Come when called? No way in hell. Ok then, months and months. 

Somewhere during that, sitting near him on the floor, tossing treats, just being there. Occasionally I could scratch his head without him flinching. The first time he voluntarily jumped on a couch to lay near me, I cried. I think he took one last chance to love again, and he spent it on me. 

Today, but looks older. The sores healed, but they left scars. His damaged eye has been removed. He has warts. He farts a lot. He's gone from skinny, to quite round. It was discovered he has a blood clotting disorder. He doesn't greet people at the door with a smile. He doesn't greet them at all. He doesn't like to be the center of attention. He doesn't play fetch or tug or anything at all. He always thinks its thirty degrees warmer than it really is, so he pants the loudest pant I have ever heard and drools like crazy if the temp gets above sixty. He still can't sit on command(we're still working on it. One day…)He isn't afraid of strangers anymore, but he is still shy.  

But he's beautiful and perfect to me. He greets me by bouncing a mere inch and a half up on his front legs. He gets to wagging his crooked tail too hard and turns himself in a shaky circle when he knows we're going for a walk. His one eye nearly bugs right out of his head when he's presented with a treat. When you give him a good neck, he sticks his neck out and kicks his back foot. He asks for my attention by coming up to me and leaning on my leg. Never pushy, never a whine, never a stare, just a weighty reminder that he is right there, and I could pet him if I wanted to. He snores like a damn grizzly and barks in his sleep. When he wants the jumpy girl dog to play, he flops on his back and squirms around

He is broken, give him plenty of scratches. If he lives two more years or ten more years, those years will be spent with me as blissfully as I can manage. I don't care if he never learns to sit. I don't care about his farts, his medical needs, or if he ever chases a ball. He is free to be whatever he wants to be. If he remains broken in some ways, that's ok. I love my broken dog.

&gt;No-kill shelters simply turn away animals

Breaking apart by pieces:
&gt;No-kill shelters simply turn away animals

Wrong. There are two types of no kill shelters, often times animals do get impeccable care at these facilities. I volunteered at one regularly for three years and adopted an animal from one. I witnessed them do a double hip replacement surgery on a dog that needed it. Many, not all, take very excellent care of their animals, better than what many shelters can do.

Secondly

&gt;because it's a simple fact that there are far more homeless animals than there are homes available

Wrong again. There are more homes looking to add an animal each year than there are animals being killed each year. It is a marketing and public perception problem

&gt;And as for ""adoption organizations"" many of them simply browse the spca and dog kennel shelters and scoop up the cutest and most adoptable dogs for around $50-70 then resell them as a ""rehoming fee"" for 200-300 and write up some bs story of how the dog was moments from being put down.

Wrong again. I am a leader and board member for a rescue. We pull dogs from the kill list, or to homes with dogs that they do get along with.

Further, we are losing even more. Donations and grants make up where we lack.

&gt;It's a scam.

No

You cannot group all shelters and rescues as one. We are all different.

Most importantly
**There are open admission no kill shelters. I live 10 minutes from one in Rockwall

It is time that we, and please ask yourself why you shouldn't be angry about this. Get out there, volunteer, foster, and network the animals at risk in your community.

We can be a no kill nation but everyone needs to pitch in and do your part.

On Sunday, IL for grooming. He was a stinky farm dog so he needed a bath and nail trim. We didn't think anything of the event as it was routine. In prior appts he had left a happy, clean pup with no problems at all. 

Shortly after putting Buster in PetCo's care, and he was dead. Totally natural, happens all the time, right? No further explanations have been given. PetCo has also refused to even speak on the matter as advised by their corporate office.

Let me know if I've left anything important out. Remember, even if you have to call a 24-hour veterinarian in a different state. They are more knowledgeable and more reliable than the internet, and calling is free. You know your pet the best, and if you feel like something is wrong, it probably is. Most major cities will have at least one 24-hour veterinary hospital. They are easy to find on Google.

[Let me tell you about this fucking dog.](http://i.imgur.com/0AMHShd.jpg)

His name is Tuco. He’s a purebred Brittany. He’s five months old.

And he’s going to have to live to thirty to make up for all the shit he put us through in his youth.

When he was three months old

It was upsetting

And then last night

My dad and I were walking him along a trail just outside our neighborhood that we have often traversed. Dad was telling me about how he had seen a rattlesnake the day before

We let Tuco off leash

Like an asshole, Tuco.”

And ten seconds later

I saw a flash of movement and heard him yelp. In ten more seconds, they were neat little punctures, which were considerably less disgusting but infinitely more horrifying in the moment.

We rushed home (although not before my dad murdered the shit out of that snake). I tried fruitlessly to entice him to drink while my dad located the nearest emergency vet. He started to shake and drool, *you fucking tell him he’s a good boy.*

Finally my dad emerged with a phone number and address

When we got in, and he actually seemed to have improved. The vet techs shuffled in and out of our room with paperwork and repetitive questions. I was finally starting to feel a little better as my dad read statistics from his phone about pets bitten by rattlesnakes. Apparently, about 95% survived. Tuco was young and strong; his odds were good.

Then the vet told us he had a 40% chance of survival.

Of course, being unimpressed with *Time* magazine, contemplating whether or not I should just start opening doors until I found my dog, trying not to sob hysterically, sobbing hysterically, and using up the vets’ supply of tissues. (They didn’t stand a chance against my dual-pronged attack of grief and allergies. Trees know me as “the Slayer.”)

Having spent over an hour alternating between being sure my dog would live and making plans for the funeral, although “the prognosis [was] guarded.” We drove home in silence.

It would have been my turn to take him for the night. I stared at the crate that sat empty in my room

The next morning

Well. With that news, and am now high on sleepiness.) I saw him today and he was acting like a puppy with a weird face. That was more excitement than I needed, ever. But he lived, so I’ll take it.

I guess the moral of the story is that there are rattlesnakes sometimes and you should avoid them. Also

We got her from the pound when she was around a year old and she immediately was attached to us at the hip. At times she was obnoxious and incredibly needy but she never lacked loyalty. When she died yesterday we'd had her for almost 4 years

When I got home things went from bad to worse. I went downstairs to take care of her body only to find drops of blood all over

At this point we decided to take her body to the vet to find out what happened because she clearly didn't die from natural causes. After an x-ray we were told she'd been shot with a pellet gun that had punctured her lung and ultimately killed her. 

This morning I picked her body up from the vet and buried her. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done. She was honestly the sweetest dog in the world. We also have a chihuahua and they were the best of friends

Just wanted to vent about this whole process. I'm a fucking mess. I've cried at least every hour since I got home yesterday at 2:30. I miss her immensely and can't imagine why anyone would do such an awful thing. 

[This is a fairly recent picture of her.](http://i.imgur.com/Z47Sbyz.jpg?1)  


EDIT: Wow

I've seen several comments about how this could have just been a freak accident and I want to think that's what happened. That it was some punk ass kid trying to be funny or something and that one in however many hundreds chance of that pellet hitting the perfect (or I guess the opposite of perfect) spot happened for whatever reason.

I've knocked on countless doors and spoke to countless neighbors. No one has seen anything.

Just giving her 1 dose completely changed her. She has so much life now!

It was because I didn't have a fenced-in yard.  I attempted to contact 11 different rescues over the course of three months and here were my results:  
  
  
Three of them refused to answer any questions by email or phone until I filled out the adoption application for the dog I was interested in.  Even questions like ""how old is the dog listed?"" considering the age wasn't on the listing
  
  
The other 8 rescues rejected my application immediately because I answered that I did not have a fenced-in yard.  
  
  
None of the rescues asked about the situation.  None of them followed up beyond ""we do not rescue dogs for people unless they have fences"".  
  
  
None of them asked about my yard, three streams, two enormous meadows, and a small pond - clearly a horrible environment for a dog.  Even when I entered the above information on the application next to the fence question, did it help?  Nope, instead, I was flatly rejected and ended up going to Craigslist to get a dog who may or may not have been from a puppy mill, while driving people to them at the same time.
  
  
There is a real issue with dog rescues in this country, home visits, 4 day interview processes, 6 week application processes, and asinine, inflexible policies like the fence policy are going to send people elsewhere, like all of the places the rescues so desperately hate.

  About a week ago I brought out the space heater because my family room is pretty cold but I don't feel it's cold enough to warrant turning on the heat to the entire house. When I brought it out Sonny sniffed it cautiously and accepted it without a problem. It's been on and off for at least a week with him paying any attention to it

   So, right), and playing with Sonny. We were cuddling on the couch when he got up and started pacing the room, whining every couple of steps. He started circling the space heater. ""Leave it alone, Sonny. It's just the heater."" He sat down and stared at me. ""Sonny, come back to the couch."" He stands up and circles the heater once more before he begins barking at it. Obviously annoyed, I get up to show him that the heater isn't going to eat him. That's when the smell hits me: THE SPACE HEATER IS OVER HEATING! I quickly pick it up and realize that the heater is turned up to the max, just to be safe. I turn to Sonny, I was in my own little world. The smell was even strong enough to reach to my parent's room; my dad actually told me to go check on the furnace.

  I felt like sharing this because my family doesn't seem to understand the significance

My dog got up from his nap to trot out into my driveway and start barking. I saw Clyde, turns around once getting back to his truck and moves towards Clyde which prompts him to start wagging his tail only to be met with a boot to the mouth. I was appalled. I understand that dogs can sometimes be a threat to a delivery guy, I let go of Clyde because I thought he was going to leave

Is there anything I can do about this? I don't imagine there is but it really stunned and disgusted me. I went out and yelled at him and he threw some bad language my way. I'm sure I'm not the first person to experience this but I would really like to file a complaint even though I know it wouldn't do much good

UPDATE: I've made a post to their facebook page and have been making several calls to the FedEx offices and am waiting to hear back on any progress. On a sidenote, I was too preoccupied giving my dog a lookover to make sure his jaw/teeth weren't broken as he wimpered and cowered his way back to me. I could barely yell some choice words back at him before he was on his way down the street. Easier said than done, but I'd rather ensure the health of my dog than get petty revenge when I know that I could get this guy fired instead. Go give her dogs a treat, some love, and a nice long walk. They sure deserve it.

**UPDATE2**: Made more calls to the FedEx chain of command, thank you for your help and cooperation. That being said, I saw the same delivery man deliver a package to my neighbor this morning. My father was home today, as I have a follow up appointment from a recent surgery scheduled this afternoon that he is going to go with me too, and we had another chat with this guy. Voices were raised, choice words were thrown, but in the end I think we settled it the best we could. His side of the story was different than mine, but I hope the publicity that this has gained has made them at least think about changing their policies. Anyways, so I'm just hoping that this was an unfortunate one-time occurrence and that his views on dogs have changed.

1365521694.0,1bzsoy,Milo. The moment that I'll always hate myself for and always respect our dog for.,eclipse75,384,55,43,"Milo ran away and I gave up on him. Damn do I hate myself for it.

Going back in time, he rode with my brother for 10 hours into Southern Missouri while I was stuck driving the uhaul with our devil of a cat.

We finally arrived at a hotel in the city we were moving to. My brother, doing nothing, followed by taking Milo for a piss. This was the routine for a day or two.

Well, I let him chill out in the backyard. We went for lunch and when we came back, he was gone. It turned out when we drove away, he panicked, being in a new place, and dug under the fence to find us. We were pretty devastated.

We put up fliers,000 people. It was October. There was traffic and the cold at night to worry about. A tiny black short haired dog makes for an easy target for death.

It put a downer on moving into the new house. We just changed our home of 24 years and started off by losing our dog of 6 years.

It went on this way for about 2 weeks until I gave up hope and started talking about buying another dog. I hated not having his companionship. I started telling my mother about different breeds but her and my brother were resistant. My ignorant brother was still putting faith into finding our dog. But, hit by a car, or got sick from the cold and died by that point. But, my mother and my brother continued to search everywhere including the hotel. No such luck.

No hope and 3 weeks in.

It was October 31st. We got a call about them spotting a dog similiar to ours in the flier near a liqour store. We went there, it was him. We called him out and as soon as he heard my mothers voice his skinny body ran for her. He peed himself with joy all the way back to our home in my mothers SUV.

The liqour store was about 100 yards across some railroad tracks from that hotel. He waited for us there for 3 weeks.

tl;dr: Our dog traveled 2 miles in a new city trying to find us at a hotel we stayed at when we first arrived. Traveled across a 4 lane high way and many busy streets in October. The cold rain and wind persisted. And yet

Damn do I hate myself for it.

[One of the first pictures of me and Sam](http://i.imgur.com/Qg9VnbV)

[Last of us


If you don't mind

1) Sammy was the most affectionate attention-whore I've ever known. Absolutely loved people. If he wasn't being touched or petted, or grumble until you noticed him. If I was gaming or watching a movie, he [had to at least have a paw on me](http://imgur.com/yZ1qs7h) if not be [sprawled across my lap](http://imgur.com/ddKqX). My favorite is that he would curl up under my arm every night or even fall asleep lying on me while I napped on the couch. 

2) Sammy fancied himself to be a great hunter and did catch the occasional squirrel or bird. One summer night there was a rabbit hanging out in the front yard of my apartment building. Sam spotted him, who usually wasn't there anymore. It was hilarious.

3) One time I had an idea to increase Sam's exercise he got from walks. I'd put one of those weighted doggy vests on him so he'd have to haul a few extra pounds around with him. Maybe it would slow him down, unweighted at first to accustom him to the feel, and started moving to the door. We didn't make it 5 feet. He hated the feel and wouldn't walk. The next morning I decided to put it on him before I went to work so he'd have all day to grow used to the feel and we could progress from there. I put it on him and he sat down, clearly disliking his situation. I returned from work 8-9 hours later and that dog hadn't moved all day. Still sitting in the same spot. We never tried that again. You won that one, buddy.

Thanks for reading if you do. Just need to get some of this out for therapeutic reasons. I still wish I had more time with him. He was a great dog.",,t5_2qhhk,1365379940.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1asvgc/farewell_sam/

I can see him relaxing in some hedges on the far side. Yup

I open the gate and enter. The groundskeeper is nervous. ""he looks vicious. What if that's not your dog?""

So I circle the other way to leave a scent trail

She sent me this text message this morning:

This morning, slick down my hair, put a small jacket over my PJ's and head out the back door of the hotel.  He does his business and we walk around to the front door as the back door is locked.  I see a side door so because I gave him a bath last night and forgot to put his collar on and he's not on his leash, I decide to sneak in the side door.  

We walk into a hallway and as we are heading down the hall

The lead speaker stops talking and there I am at the door of this giant conference room calling him to come back....which he doesn't.  So there I am in my PJ's running around the conference room chasing Max. Max by now thinks this is a fun game so he books it every time I come near him.....i am apologizing the whole time for interrupting their seminar. 

Everyone starts laughing and the lead speaker says that this was a first.  I finally talk him into coming to the front door by coaxing him with treats.  I think he made their day.

So here's the deal. There is no excuse for not taking your dog to the vet when it is sick, and you likely even signed a legal contract with the adoption center/breeder/etc stating that you would take care of all medical needs. You have an obligation to that dog to take care of it.

Now I understand financial issues happen. I am recently unemployed and am running a bit thin on money myself. However

So what can you do to help with the medical costs?

* 1. Put some money in a separate bank account. Use this money ONLY in the case of medical emergency.
* 2. Have a credit card on hand. You don't have to use it
* 3. Get pet insurance. It is really not that expensive
* 4. Get a pet line of credit. Companies like [CareCredit](http://www.carecredit.com/vetmed/) will give you a credit card to use only at the vet. They wont even work anywhere other than your vet.
* 5. Ask friends and family for help. If you can't afford it yourself
* 6. Find someone else who can take proper care of your dog. If you can't afford treatment

Your dog deserves to be healthy. Please take your dog to the vet when needed. Reddit is not a veterinary clinic.

* [VPI](http://www.petinsurance.com/)
* [ASPCA](http://www.aspcapetinsurance.com/)

And during my time there I got to see all sorts of appalling things, and just plain icky things I could talk about

http://imgur.com/ItnRB0x 

That dude is Buddy. He is an unruly gleeful fellow with no manners. Anyhow, returned, and then adopted out THE SAME DAY he returned to another family, and then returned again a few days later. The adoption counselors spend little to absolutely no time in the kennel, so they know nothing about the dogs they adopt out. One would think if the first family who returned him had a complaint about Buddy, he would not be flipped over to the next family as fast as possible without exploring that issue, but the next family had $300 and that's how the SPCA rolls.

After Buddy's return, like taking him outside, because ""other people"" were. She always asks this before a dog dies. Buddy is a puppy in a barely year old dog's body. He is very mouthy, but no malice in that dog. He also spends at least 23 hours inside his kennel with no attention and nothing to do, put out into a tiny concrete yard for 5 minutes here and there. Recently staff was issued a note regarding how we are not behaviorists and therefore cannot assess dogs. Since no on does assess the dogs, and as someone who spends an incredible amount of time involved in dogs (and now work for a facility where I DO assess and work with dogs) I can tell you that there is nothing aggressive about Buddy, nor is he a dog that is any sort of liability. Put that guy in a place where people ACTUALLY care about him, and teach him impulse control and you've got a fine dog. I started working on Choice games and impulse control with Buddy in the small amount of time I was there in my last week and he stopped putting his mouth on me in games AND stopped mouthing his leash. This is the only training that was done with him. I texted my coworker and asked that she let me know if she hears any thing about Buddy, I knew I had to act bigger and harder this time.

Buddy's REAL issue is that he ended up at the SPCA. Buddy is definitely not the first dog to die without just cause, so that there are not more euth statistics on the ""no kill"" shelter's record.

Now I'm asking people to stay on this and not let the attention die or Buddy will die quietly with no one to dispute their bullshit. If you are interested in joining his fight

The sorry excuse of an operations manager that makes these mindless decisions: operations@spcaswmich.org


Thanks for reading. Any ideas are welcome and I am more than willing to talk about every thing I know. I have been given contacts for local media outlets and have been emailing them as well. I have photos and videos of the neglectful conditions the dogs are left in by employees, and text messages from Katie I would be willing to share. There is nothing good about this organization, other than most of the volunteers that try to make it better. That's why I stayed for so long, but I cannot continue losing dogs from inside the system and fighting in their bubble where it doesn't work. They are scared of the media and they are scared of people speaking out. They will be motivated by not looking bad, when they should be motivated by helping animals.

-Proper socialization  
-Training of basic commands  
-Walking on leash when appropriate  
-unless you show/breed

These are ALL things EVERY dog owner should do regardless of the breed you own. It never is the dog, any dog can be terrible. Don't assume anything about someone else's dog other than the behavior you are seeing. One bad dog of one breed does not condemn that entire breed. Just because one dachshund bit you doesn't mean they're all terrible. Just because pit bulls have a bad rap doesn't mean you freak out and pick up your tiny dog. Just because YOU think YOUR big dog is a 'good dog' does not mean you let him run off leash and annoy other people and their dogs who are on leash.
If you're like me and you have a big AND small dog you get the worst of both sides. People run from my lab mix because they think she's scary (I have seen grown men do this and she was just sitting next to me, the Mastiff owner yelled at ME. Excuse me but your big off leash dog charging my little on leash one? She's going to be scared. Think about what you would feel like if something 4 times your height ran at you suddenly. 
Both my girls, that's the wonderful thing about dogs.  

TL;DR: Doesn't matter what breed you own. Train it right

We were walking out to the parking lot when I heard a dog alternately whimpering and barking.


I didn't see any dog around (it was in an area where there are lots of different shops and restaurants


He was making a lot of noise, and I don't even want to know the temperature inside of the car.

I went inside and told the maitre d' there was a dog locked in a car.


His response?

&gt; So?


I told him that I would appreciate if they would find the owners


He told me he wasn't going to do that.


I asked him if he had a better idea


The restaurant manager was much more sympathetic and they went and found the owners: an older couple mid-50's I'd guess. They were pissy because they'd been eating lunch on the patio and saw me go up to their car.


They asked me what was wrong and I told them their dog shouldn't be in their car with all the windows rolled up on a hot day. Why not just leave the dog at home? Or


They said the dog always begged for food and it annoyed them. They also said ""He wanted to go for a ride and if we left the windows down while we ate he could get out.""


After a few minutes of back and forth I told them I had no problems with calling animal control and letting them sort out the issue. 

They said they'd take the dog and tie him to the fencing by the patio but he was NOT eating lunch with them. The manager said he'd bring out a bowl of water for him


At that point I left. The dog was being let out of the car and that was the important thing. 


My mom and brother told me I was overreacting and I should have minded my business. I wasn't rude to them


I handled the situation as best as I knew how. People just frustrate me.",,t5_2qhhk,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1jrzs9/dogs_in_cars_rant/

I think somebody stole him or let him loose somehow. I walked all over the neighborhood but can't find a trace of him. There's no way he gout out by himself

I don't know what to do. Please help me. I live in the city in a cul-de-sac so we never get any traffic. That makes me think it could've been a neighbor and that's a horrible thing to think.

How do I get him back? I dont know what to do and I'm so scared of letting the puppy out of my sight. He only has a collar and isnt registered so Im scared he might end up getting murdered in a pound.

EDIT: I'm in the Los Angeles area and yes I have been checking CL but nothing's up so far. I'm in the process of looking up all the animal shelters within a ten mile radius of me on google so we'lll see how that goes. I hope I can find him before anything bad happens.

EDIT 2: I found my dog. I was driving around my neighborhood this afternoon and found him in a random street not too far from me. Some asshole ran him over and dragged him to the side of the road. He was dead. I don't know how that happened or why someone would do that instead of getting help. I can't stop freaking out about it and keep alternating between crying and getting really pissed off.

I can remember the very first time I approached her she let out a scream and tried desperately to climb the kennel walls to get away from me. She was completely shut down otherwise, and had given birth to a litter of puppies that had since been sold. I heard various things, like she was supposedly going to a sanctuary, but there she sat. Towards the end of her stay there she was approaching the bars and allowing staff to scratch her through the kennel door and let her in and out willingly. Needless to say, I was shocked when I was told she was going to be euthanized November 17th, 2011. 

November 17th

For the first two weeks or so she sat far away and looked at me like this:http://imgur.com/PGv7noS 

She was afraid of dog beds, spayed, and vaccinated. Feral, she was not, and it was quickly evident whatever had happened to her wasn't going to leave a lasting impression. This are some moments from our last year and a half together: http://imgur.com/zMO50Yk,4eVoW4d,wfeCisp,Qedyz0N,4ofkf9F

Now, either. Dogs are beautiful, resilient creatures. Elsa was written off and to be euthanized when she just needed the time and patience to find her way. Now she's your average dog and someone wanted her. I have met opposition to this. The same questions, why the time and money on this dog? You could have saved dozens. I've always personally believed every dog deserves a shot and if the resource is available, why not? If you met her, you might come around to understanding. I am immeasurably happy and sad to see her go.

1352476132.0,12x0m3,My Aussie rescue's first trip to a school to meet some kids,phorkor,284,48,39,"I adopted my aussie from a local group in Houston called Barrio Dogs where we continue to work with them as a therapy dog of sorts (not certified yet but we're working towards it) and part of their educational and outreach program. Our main focus is educating young children in low income areas on the proper treatment and caring for animals. 

This past Wednesday was our first time to make a trip to a school together where I told his story about how he was dumped on the streets and literally sat on a corner for 2 weeks with no food or water ( aside from scraps people would throw at him), the dog in the book's names in Henry and is an aussie. [This](http://i.imgur.com/LCzgv.jpg) is my aussie Henry, who has no tail. 

Just wanted to share our first trip and brag of sorts about how wonderful he was with the kids and how much fun we had doing this. The pic above was when we first arrived and had to sign in. We met with some of the administration of the school and introduced them to Henry. [Here's a pic of me](http://i.imgur.com/mcF9a.jpg), I [walked him around](http://i.imgur.com/0clev.jpg) and let the kids meet him, say hi and answered questions. While the other person with me read the book he [sat there quite calm](http://i.imgur.com/bylTg.jpg) and just relaxed. After the book the kids got to come up one by one and say hi to Henry and [take a picture with him](http://i.imgur.com/ecXUw.jpg). I think he really liked the [teacher](http://i.imgur.com/xwcp8.jpg)

This being my first trip with him to a school I was a good bit nervous. He's always been wonderful around kids and never had any issues but usually at the other events we've done we were outside rather than in a confined classroom. As soon as we walked in he did his normal thing and I knew he was going to do great. At one point we had about 25 kids all crowding around him and one kid even pulling his ear to get Henry to come to him and he just went with it and his nub of a tail kept wagging the entire time. It was quite fun and amazing.

Because the weather is so warm here

The neighbor on my right was a single man that I'd estimate was in his thirties. From what I observed throughout my months as his neighbor, but were friendly, and appeared to be fed on a regular basis.

--- ABOUT THE PUPPY ---

In early spring of 2011, where she could escape from the hot sun. (Many houses in Louisiana do not have basements and are raised about a foot off of the ground.)

I eventually introduced myself to my neighbor and admitted how much I adored his puppy. I asked if I could walk and play with her

As the weeks went by and the weather got hot

She often had old food in her dish

Soon he moved her to a spot behind his shed

http://i.imgur.com/UgIJa.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/XHKOF.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/lUwm7.jpg

I expressed to my boyfriend, a few feet from where she was tethered behind a shed. He took it upon himself to suggest to the owner (in a very strong way) that he should get her to a vet. She wasn't looking very healthy, and was acting sick. Her lethargy only abated in the first minutes I'd visit her each day.

http://i.imgur.com/s2JZm.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/LC7Uo.jpg

From there it only seemed to get worse. The below picture was taken at the end of June.

http://i.imgur.com/UH2ZY.jpg

He never took her to see a vet

I called animal control. 

They said they had someone check on the puppy, and I could bring them into my yard and show them. Behind our street is a public dirt road, and she was easily visible. I called for a week straight, and each time they gave me another excuse.

""The dog wasn't there.""
""We couldn't locate the residence.""
""We found the location

I continued to give her food and water. I bathed the fleas off of her. I tweezed plant spikes out from the pads of her feet. But I couldn't bring her to the vet to get proper care

On July nineteenth, walked around the fence and her yard and into mine, and from there she didn't know what to do.

She was having difficulty breathing

Animal control dismissed my reports. The police directed me back to animal control. 


--- HAPPY ENDING! ---


That night I brought her back to her yard, my previous neighbor's wife (she now lived a few blocks away. We'll call her Pam) came to see me.

Pam was concerned about the dog too.

I told her that he wouldn't even notice if the dog was gone. He didn't care about her

""We see that you don't care about your animal

I jumped the fence

She brought Honey to the vet. Honey had worms


It's been about five months and today Honey (renamed Basha) is happy


The kicker? The neglectful neighbor never asked about the dog. The food and water bowls are still in his yard.

We set up an appointment with both a vet and a groomer(he still wasn't entirely clean and needs professional help).

* **Vet Check**

The vet says he fractured all 4 of his canine teeth chewing on metal or a rock type surface for a prolonged period of time. All four of his teeth had received zero medical care &amp; were broken at separate times.

He appeared to have difficulty getting up the stairs

He has intestinal parasites! We noticed that he seemed to be whining a lot for no determinable reason

We are still waiting for the results from his heartworm test.

* **The Vet's conclusion**

Extreme neglect. This dog has obviously not been kept indoors or cared for for a very long time. It takes many months for a collar to become stuck to a dog's fur with sticky

Shibas are well known for having knee problems and he appears to be a well bred male-an expensive puppy indeed. Yet, and no owners are looking for him. 

His teeth must have been like this for over a year! You HAD to have noticed his limping on three legs or having trouble walking! 

Amazingly

* **The Rescue**

MSIR is an amazing rescue that is truly willing to do anything for a dog. He will be receiving extremely expensive surgeries(the vet quoted us at 2k per knee surgery) and every thing else he could possibly need because they are committed to helping him. They are even holding a fundraiser on his behalf later this year. 

* **To his last home**

If you come looking for him

if you cant drop a piece of food on the ground without the dog making a mad dash for it despite saying ""no!"" you need work in this area, or put it in his bowl. 



the trash is the same deal, if you want to ask for advice on a certain issue then just ask here for others to offer what worked for them.

Before I start

My best friend was having a get together at her house in our home town. My fiance (Luke) and I decided to go home for the weekend to see all of our friends. Pup came with us, my friend's dog zoned in on her and ran at her barking. Not aggressively, but enough to startle our sensitive girl. She backed out of her flat collar and ran into the middle of the road. I called her desperately, thinking that she would get hit by a car. As I started advancing toward her, she bolted. Being a black dog on a rainy/misty night, she was lost almost immediately.

**Many people say it takes days or weeks for a lost dog to slip into ""survival mode"" - that is, I think the combination of Bella's sensitive personality and the fact that she was startled in an unfamiliar place made her revert almost immediately.**

This happened at approximately **9:30 PM on a Saturday night**. Right away

**11:00 PM Saturday:** A neighbor spotted her in the road about 100 yards from where she got loose. He tried calling her and she bolted - again. 

**2:30 AM Sunday:** Luke and I were just about to give up and go to bed after searching for 5 hours. About 4.5 of those hours were on foot

**6:30 AM Sunday:** As soon as the sun rose

**10:00 AM Sunday:** We got a phone call that Bella had been spotted 3 miles from where she had gotten loose. Hopped in the truck and patrolled that area for about an hour until we got another call that it was a false alarm - the dog spotted was black

**6:00 PM Sunday:** Luke needed to get some sleep, we got a call that she had been spotted in a hay field across the street from my friend’s house. 

**7:30 PM Sunday:** We tracked her down in a hedgerow along the edge of the field. She tried to make herself invisible and allowed us to get within 20 ft of her because I think she thought we couldn’t see her. The second I said her name she was up and gone. At this point Luke realizes he cannot go back without Bella and calls out of work for Monday.

**8:00 PM Sunday:** We realized we needed to change our game plan. A guy who lives nearest the field she was spotted in graciously allowed us use of his garage. We scrounged up every pair of our dirty clothes that we could

**7:00 AM Monday:** We went back to Luke’s house to regroup. We knew we were running out of time and chances to catch Bella. We even discussed traps and drugging. Once we ate breakfast

**8:30 AM Monday:** I thought it might help if we had another dog that Bella knows

**9:30 AM Monday:** Radley and I took a hike through the fields and waited for a sighting.

**10:30 AM Monday:** It seems that possibly Radley’s scent stirred Bella up and Luke spotted her headed our direction

So I took the food, freezing cold ground with a bowl of tasty, smelly food next to me. I didn’t move, talk to her, or look at her. I just sat and waited for over an hour and a half. [This was my view.](http://i.imgur.com/5Yk7d.jpg)

**12:00 PM Monday:** Bella finally got brave (hungry?) enough to cautiously make her way toward me. She stopped about 10 feet away from me and started barking. Not a friendly bark either. I think she was trying to scare me off of the food. At this point I started to softly and calmly talk to her and slowly held out a piece of steak. I was so nervous - this was my ONLY chance to catch her. What if my frozen fingers didn’t react quickly enough to grab her? What if she freaked and bit me?

As she reached out to smell the steak in my hand, the realization came over her that this stranger was her MOMMY! I have never seen an animal so clearly have a moment of total relief and utter happiness. And in one second, it was all over. She was jumping and licking and whining and crying (oh wait, the crying was me!). 

**TL;DR...This was seriously the most harrowing experience I have ever had. I learned some very valuable information those few days and I'd like to pass it along.**

* If you have a sensitive dog who gets scared easily

* If your dog is startled and is in a situation that could be dangerous (like standing in the middle of the road) DON'T freak out. They can tell and it makes them even MORE nervous. 

* If you suspect your dog has gone into ""survival mode"" but know their general location, smelly food, anything to help ""wake up"" the part of their brain that recognizes it.  They'll at least be close enough to grab if they still don't recognize you.

* If all else fails

* Get your dog microchipped! It didn't help in my scenario

* Make sure to get your dog's info out there: facebook, phone calls...etc. etc. I had total strangers out patrolling for her and by Sunday morning almost everyone in our township knew to drive slowly and carefully in the area where she was lost.

My wife and I have never had a dog. We have been toying around with the idea of getting one recently for 2 year old son. This guy seems to be really friendly and playful but because he's so big, if no one comes to retrieve him and we decide to keep him, what can I do about this behavior? Can't I train him to allow my son to run around without knocking him over and biting? He does a lot of snipping too. When you're trying to walk, he's also intertwining in your legs, nearly tripping you or even snipping at your legs. Are these behaviors that can be trained away? What do I need to do if we keep him? Vet? Medicine? Food?

So Saturdays usually bring out new people, when their dog was just running around playing.  

My pup is only 7 months and very inquisitive, came up and jabbed my dog on the back.  WTF?!!  I immediately went up to them and asked them what the fuck they were thinking.  My dog was doing nothing wrong and if they didn't like my dog sniffing their dog, it's ok to push him off, but don't fucking hit him.  Her response?  ""I didn't hit your dog.  If you watch Cesar Milan, you would know it's just a training technique.""  I went off.

Training technique?  Like how your dog's been ignoring you for 15 minutes while you stand here calling his name?  I asked if they've ever been to the dog park before because this is how dog's interact with each other.  I asked if they even have a dog park pass and if not

I was at the Bear Creek (Bill Archer) Dog Park (Houston
This dog came home with us and

She is just under 25 pounds and is still a puppy but I'm not sure how old. My guess is that she's 6 months old but the vet will give us a better estimate tomorrow. She will be getting her shots/heart-worm test

She's definitely a mixed breed. I see Basenji (point ears

She is a lover and eager to please. Her previous family had small children and she likes kids. She is obedient, she wouldn't still be with me.)

It's not possible for her to stay with us and I may have to take her to a shelter. I don't want to do that. So...you know the drill, spam (carefully) your friends.

The shelter manager's letter:

""I am posting this (and it is long) because I think our society needs a huge wake-up call.

As a shelter manager

Maybe if you saw the life drain from a few sad, you would change your mind about breeding and selling to people you don't even know - that puppy you just sold will most likely end up in my shelter when it's not a cute little puppy anymore.

How would you feel if you knew that there's about a 90% chance that dog will never walk out of the shelter it is going to be dumped at - purebred or not! About 50% of all of the dogs that are ""owner surrenders"" or ""strays"" that come into my shelter are purebred dogs.

No shortage of excuses
The most common excuses I hear are:

We are moving and we can't take our dog (or cat).
Really? Where are you moving to that doesn't allow pets?

The dog got bigger than we thought it would.
How big did you think a German Shepherd would get?

We don't have time for her.
Really? I work a 10-12 hour day and still have time for my 6 dogs!

She's tearing up our yard.
How about bringing her inside

They always tell me:
We just don't want to have to stress about finding a place for her. We know she'll get adopted - she's a good dog. Odds are your pet won't get adopted

Well

Your pet has 72 hours to find a new family from the moment you drop it off
If it sniffles

Your pet will be confined to a small run / kennel in a room with about 25 other barking or crying animals. It will have to relieve itself where it eats and sleeps. It will be depressed and it will cry constantly for the family that abandoned it.
If your pet is lucky
If your dog is big, mastiff, etc) it was pretty much dead when you walked it through the front door. Those dogs just don't get adopted.
If your dog doesn't get adopted within its 72 hours and the shelter is full

If the shelter isn't full and your dog is good enough, though not for long. Most pets get very kennel protective after about a week and are destroyed for showing aggression. Even the sweetest dogs will turn in this environment.
If your pet makes it over all of those hurdles

The grim reaper
Here's a little euthanasia 101 for those of you that have never witnessed a perfectly healthy
First, until they get to ""The Room"".

Every one of them freaks out and puts on the breaks when we get to the door. It must smell like death, held down by 1 or 2 vet techs (depending on their size and how freaked out they are). A euthanasia tech or a vet will start the process. They find a vein in the front leg and inject a lethal dose of the ""pink stuff"". Hopefully your pet doesn't panic from being restrained and jerk it's leg. I've seen the needles tear out of a leg and been covered with the resulting blood, and been deafened by the yelps and screams.

They all don't just ""go to sleep"" - sometimes they spasm for a while
When it all ends, waiting to be picked up like garbage.

What happens next? Cremated? Taken to the dump? Rendered into pet food? You'll never know, right?

Liberty
I hope that those of you that have read this are bawling your eyes out and can't get the pictures out of your head. I do everyday on the way home from work. I hate my job

Between 9 and 11 MILLION animals die every year in shelters and only you can stop it. I do my best to save every life I can but rescues are always full
My point to all of this is DON'T BREED OR BUY WHILE SHELTER PETS DIE!

Hate me if you want to - the truth hurts and reality is what it is.
I just hope I maybe changed one person's mind about breeding their dog
That would make it all worth it.""

After months of refusing to leave the house out of growing fear

[obligitory photo of my rat terrier/PTSD super hero](http://imgur.com/j7N4WqY)

Now to the point.
It is getting harder and harder to take him out in public without people's interest in him causing me panic attacks and paralyzing fear.  I understand a lot of people don't know what a PTSD dog is

But honestly
""So what is PTSD?""
""Do you have PTSD?""
""Were you in the war?""
""How do i get one of those? I get nervous sometimes too.""
This kind of probing is triggering

Yesterday I had this conversation with a random girl


Again
Most times I don't even mind explaining other types of service dogs beyond the token seeing eye dog as well as what a PTSD dog can do to help their person. 

I know most of the people here at r/dogs are much more intelligent and respectful than this. But if you could do me a favor and spread the word about how to best interact with someone with a service dog. 
Please respect the privacy of people. All people.

I rush outside to see my 70 pound Collie-Shepherd sitting on top of the winter pool cover which we just put in! Just to give some background - he's about 13 years old and we've had him for over two years and he's never ONCE fallen in. He's also starting to have trouble with the stairs so I knew it might be tough to get him out.

I rush into the scene

Slowly but surely we manage to pull him out closer... closer... until he's out of the pool and onto the concrete with us. There wasn't much water on the cover but there was enough to get him fairly wet so of course he thanks us by shaking off all over us. The next part is amazing - he starts bouncing around

He was so happy

**Old Original Post**Any tips on how to get him through the night? He's got a swollen stomach, has a blackish jellylike excrement, and I seriously regret not taking him this afternoon to get it checked out. He was bad the previous night but in the morning seemed rejuvenated so I thought whatever it was might have passed. Tonight it suddenly took a turn for the worse when he got hit by a sudden 30 second seizure and was foaming at the mouth. I know I should be asking a vet, but due to living in China that option isn't available for another 8.5 hours. Any ideas or tips would mean a lot.

Edit: 3 hours later he suffered a second seizure, darkest part of my house, which happens to be the bathroom. Still got another 6 hours before we can get him in to the vet.

Edit 2: no more seizures, it's been a long 12 hours.

My parents moved from a house into an apartment so My boyfriend's parents were looking after her. I think she missed my parents too much and is maybe trying to find them. She is not a dog that goes wandering so it's so strange that she would disappear like this. Homeward Bound could happen in real life right?

this confused me as i had no idea what he was doing and he knows better than to get on people without being called. so i took him outside thinking maybe it was an emergency

I also grew up with large-breed dogs, when that happens

I had read about ""zombie dog owners"" recently, I always ask ANYONE, EVERY TIME whether I may pet his or her dog. In the course of training and rehabilitating dogs, I have been bitten many times, but, you know, I'd rather not be bitten. 

My dogs (and the ones we foster) are also all of a breed bred (in the beginning) solely to hunt. They have a strong prey instinct, ever trust strangers, and must be kept out of sight during parties. When folks out on the street ask to pet my dogs, I tell them, very politely, ""No, this is a vicious breed."" Four of my dogs can take off fingers without a thought, if you still have 10 fingers after a tooth-related encounter

TL;DR: So, standard Dachshunds) were going to be kept away from the party, because my friend was bringing her 10-year-old daughter, and my Dachs could EASILY have knocked her over. 

I decide to take my min pin for a walk before they arrive, she'll make a poopie in the house. And new people are exciting. Though small, most min pins are pretty vicious little brats, and tend to write checks their butts can't cash. Look 'em up on YouTube. They're very loving, but VERY protective. This one had been left virtually untrained for the first 3 years of her life. 

My neighbor comes out of her house with her big dog. I think it was a goldie mix of some kind. It was on a leash at first. Then she lets the dog OFF the leash, ""THAT'S GREAT! MINE ISN'T!"" 

The neighbor lady is otherwise very nice and I like her a lot

At the end of the day, doesn't mean that the other dogs won't enter fight-mode on seeing it, and on being rushed at by it. I have to check the neighborhood before even walking my dogs, to make sure that people who repeatedly try to pet them, or think it's okay to walk their dogs without leashes, aren't there, because a dog fight is NOT something you want to experience. Not all dogs walk away from them without injury. YOUR dog may be a nice and friendly dog around other nice dogs and people, in this case, and she very well had NO problem starting a fight she couldn't win.

Please, before just letting your dog off the leash to ""play"" with mine. I won't call the authorities if I get bitten in the course of breaking up a dog fight, but I'd rather never have to break up a fight, and I'd like to walk away with all 10 fingers and toes, and a dog I don't have to take to the ER.",,False,t5_2qhhk,True

You were so funny, guarding me, caring for me, loving me. 

Through puberty I wasn’t as good as I could have been. I was a little inattentive, and I will never forgive myself for. I was having councelling sessions at school because I was being bullied. I didn’t tell anyone in the family, and I didn’t have any friends to tell except one. And you were there for all of that. The only one I had to talk to. The one who was always there no matter what. I was so proud of you, every day I was so proud of the girl you were. Walking around with you was so incredible, everyone loved you, and I would have fought to the death anyone who said you weren’t the best thing to ever have existed. 

We grew a bit distant after I moved out. I didn’t see you so often, even after I moved to another town you were still where I left you when I came back, still loved me even though my life had gone on. I had two long term failed relationships under my belt and I was 21 years old. I was in bed with the third one when I got the call. 
My heart broke. 

It couldn’t be happening. 

I got dressed and drove home to see you. And I’ve never rode my bike that fast in my life and never will again. 

You looked sad. You hadn’t drunk any water or eaten, I saw the tiniest smile on your face. I laid down next to you like I did that first morning and told you how much I loved you. How you made everything that was terrible about school better, how you were my best and only friend. 

And then I told you that if it hurts too much that you should go

It’s been a year now, you truly were mans best friend, you were my guardian angel. I remember how exhausting it was lifting those heavy shovels of earth to make your grave. I remember how light you were when I carried you outside. I remember placing you in that cold ground. I remember the moment I placed that blanket over you. I remember when I had to say goodbye. 

Its been a year now

I hope wherever you are

I hope I’ll see you one day.

1. Everytime we part is painful to me – even if it's only for a short while . Please consider this before taking me in to live with you.

2. Do not be harsh if I have to be punished. You have your job

3. Please allow me to take my time trying to understand what it is that you wish from me.

4. Before you would hit me please remember that I could easily crush your hand in my jaws

5. Please do talk to me sometimes. I may not understand every word you say

6. Don't forget that I was a wild creature once. Let me run around and enjoy moving in the green fields or the forest once in a while – which will be good for you as well.

7. I ask you to be generous with tasty snacks. They always taste the best when received from You – and so I do my best to earn them.

8. You are my Master – not anyone else. So please don't ask me to heed to others' commands or that I humiliate or shame myself in front of them. 

9. Do remember that in time I too develop a personality

10. Take care of me if I become sick or old – after all

Found this little guy in my garage last night. He was pretty hungry and looks like he's been on the street for a while. I'm working on making some posters but have no idea what breed he is. He could either be a puppy or be a a miniature breed of some kind. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks guys!

UPDATE: Wow! Thanks for all of the great response. I'm sorry I couldn't reply to everyone but I have been reading most of the comments throughout the day. There was a lot of good advice here. I will be taking him to get scanned for a microchip maybe tomorrow. I had to go to work for a little while and then have been spending time with the little guy. He's so much more comfortable and is letting me pet him. He doesn't shake anymore and isn't hiding. It seems like he has some fleas. I sprayed him with my dog's flea spray and I'm going to try to give him a bath tonight with some oatmeal flea shampoo. He's a lot happier so I think I can get him into my car to go to the humane society to get checked out. I called but they didn't have any lost dogs that matched his description. I'll keep trying and I've completed the found dog poster. I'll ask around my neighborhood as well. Thanks everyone and I will try to respond to as many of you as I can. Also

UPDATE 2: Here's my new post updated. There's some pictures in there after I gave him a bath and fed him. He's following me around everywhere now like... well... a lost puppy. He's so loving,False,,t5_2qhhk,1344487928.0,,,t3_xtm1z

A few years ago I was at the home of a fellow I was dating at the time who had a gorgeous and sweet bull mastiff. I'd gotten to know the dog, so assumed he was also very comfortable around me.

One day we were heading out somewhere to grab a bite to eat and I went to go ""give kisses"" to the dog when suddenly I heard a loud growl/bark and felt teeth in my face. Yup, but it was a hard lesson learned.

This is a Samoyed who rarely gets to be off leash outside the dog park (he's a roamer... only trustworthy in open spaces when he has a dog friend to play with). He was so

Oh - and he's usually reactive to other dogs

We are gonna be doing way more biking from now on. For anyone else who has a high energy or high strung dog,False,,t5_2qhhk,False,,,t3_1jouwa

We went to Zagreb and they made new blood test which was even worse than last so he immediatly got blood transfusion from a dog wrom Dog shelter. Blood was little better tomorrow. They also gave him infusion and took his lymph nodes sample. They sent us to do the x-ray and ultra sound. On x-ray they found some liquid in his chest which is later confirmed on ultra sound that is lymph node. It is 7 cm big and it presses his vein. They took a sample from it, didn't eat in three days, won't move and including his blood it is very likely he wouldn't survive surgery, which is btw very expensive. If he would survive that, they don't give him much chances to survive recovery. It would be torchure for him.

We are now home, but I'm so sad. I know what is right thing to do, because this is not quality life for him anymore, and it is only getting worse for all of us. But I'm so selfish and didn't decide yet 100%.

I can only say that I'm happy that Tango lived happy life and he was truly loved. Also

It is very agressive cancer and you don't know that your dog has it until it is this bad. It is often found on some routine vet visit or while you are curing something else. 

I really love my dog and don't want him to suffer anymore. This is everything so fast :(

And yes, his diagnose and prognose would be pretty much the same only he would maybe be stronger to survive operation and that would make his life little bit longer.

He is a good boy

So so so sad :( **

**EDIT 2

Tomorrow I'm taking him to the best clinic in country, I can't wait anymore not knowing what is it. Thank you everyone for your advise and if anyone is interested I will update tomorrow.

**

First of all

I have a golden retriever

It all started one month ago when he was attacked and bitten by two dogs for no reason (my dog was on the leash, but we didn't see bite on his body (it was covered by hair). He was acting sick, refused to eat and to walk... but we couldn't find any other bite so we thought he was just shocked.

A week later hair started to fall out and another wound showed up. It was full of pus (i think it's the right word). So, he started to eat normally and we thought he is fine (or soon he will be). His wound is now fine, new skin grew and hair is starting to grow.

Then, we tried three different types of drops and unguents (Tobrex, Maxitrol and now Chloramphenicol). All vets said they never saw anything like this. After ten days his whole head was swollen and he couldn't breathe normally, he started to snore really loud, and his left eyelid started to swell, and, I almost forgot, I forgot the name of it but it is also a part of the eye as they said to me). Fourth vet took his blood and results were very bad. Really high leukocytes and lymphocytes, i guess) and he is very happy

Did anyone have similar situation? I don't understand how is this all connected (bite-eyes-very bad blood results)? They think maybe he had chigoe that we didn't see (I don't believe this because I comb his hair daily and I would notice it) or it is some kind of bacteria/virus that he got from his wound when he was licking it or I don't know...) or worst case scenario that is leukemia (also how is that possible and what coincidence? and how is that connected to eyes?).

I'm so confused and under a lot of stress and I'm freaking out a lot because I don't see any improvements. It all together lasts one month (from the bite) and his eyes are swollen for two and a half weeks. I know that it can take a while to heal

I'm sorry for a long post

Please

Here is the gallery (picture of the wound is from when it looked very bad

**EDIT:

Thank you everyone who are trying to help.

I'm from Croatia for those who are wondering.

Here is the picture of his wound today, but not sure): http://imgur.com/mYlAK,JqaxE#0

About changing a vet; this last one was on his vacation and returned on Aug 20th. He seems like very good improvement because he (the vet) is actually doing something, 7 vet stations) they have same or worse equipment and you should see their attitude. Blah, I wish I went to vet school.

About medications; when he suffered from bite he was given amoxicillin (injections and pills). When his eye startet to swell they only gave him tobrex drops, he changed his antibiotics to doxycyclinium (3+3 pills a day), and he gave my dog some pills against allergies (I'm not sure if they helped or not, but his face is not swollen anymore, except eyes). And he gave him iron (or something like that for his anemia) and I continued to give my dog some pills with the same purpose. Like I already said in comments, I don't know exact names of medications because they don't come in original packing and bills are hand written and very hard to read. The vet tells me what he gives him but I can't remember everything. 

And yes

In a few hours we are going to the vet again

Thank you all and please post more if you have any idea!

Here is Tango when he is healthy and funny as he normally is: http://imgur.com/mQiYW

I already checked him for a tag and called the local animal control. He's not a threat to anyone

He could be microchipped, and they'll take care of the vetrinary services as part of the adoption fee. I didn't really have a breed in mind as it is, and he seems like what I would want in a dog (not to big/small, gentle temperment).

TL;DR: Stray walked into my job

EDIT: Bonus points for whoever can tell me the breed.

UPDATE: The dog is in the shelter on base for now. His holding period is up on Friday, so other than Craigslist, there's no real way to pinpoint which neighborhood to canvas with fliers. There was no microchip, so he's probably not from the housing here, even though he seems to be in great condition. I'll get to visit him tomorrow, and will probably update again once I talk to the shelter.

In case anyone wonders

The following day, but when I asked for the license number, he said he lost it. He couldn't remember the vet station's name or address, either.

""Sir, I asked.
""It's a dog

Next I asked if he'd chip in for the veterinary bills. The dog came to me with piroplasmosis and her treatment was costly

He said he'd give me ""what he could"", I was stupid to have paid for it. I should have just let her die, he argued, because ""it's not the only dog in the world.""

I asked him why he wanted her back in the first place.
""Huh? To watch my property.""
""Always chained?""
""You know what

This is a list of all the resources I wish I had in one place when I got a dog. Hope it's helpful.

As far as finding a dog: try http://www.petfinder.com/ Pet Expos are also great. The one in Orange County is the largest (I think) http://petexpooc.org/ but there are Expos in most major cities. The nice thing about Pet Expos is you're adopting (yay!), and they usually give you a gift certificate for vaccinations. My dog, Lola only cost $200 to adopt (my dad paid over $1500 for his dog from a breeder). The expo gave us a gift certificate for $250 to a vet, so her vaccinations and spay only cost us like $500 instead of $750. And expos usually have a TON of dogs, so you can get the breed you want. You can go to a ghetto vet for vaccinations but choose a NICE, reputable vet for spaying or nuetering. If the vet fucks that up the dog can be incontinent for the rest of its life.

Also, no hitting, etc. Seriously for realz, don't hurt pupz.

I really like these dog trainers: http://www.youtube.com/user/zakgeorge21/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=0 and http://www.youtube.com/user/kikopup/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=0

I used a combination of these two videos to teach Lola to walk on a loose leash: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIdeT5S9u4Y&amp;list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&amp;index=119&amp;feature=plcp and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8cPkTh7Y3k It for realz takes like 1-2 months to get your dog to walk reliably loose leash...be prepared and don't get frustrated. Also

This is the best harness for walking: http://www.premier.com/View.aspx?page=dogs/products/collars/easywalk/description IF they do pull

This is the best video for teaching your dog ""leave it"" (the most helpful command when they're a puppy and want to chew on everything): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i-L3-gqWic

If they simply won't stop chewing on something, text books, shoes).

I would highly recommend getting your pup around other dogs as much and as soon as possible. Dog parks are the best for this. It's good if you have a friend with another dog

Oh, nose, ears, tail, paws constantly. Get the dog used to being touched wherever. This will make them generally chill and also make things like brushing and grooming and baths WAY easier.

This is the video I first found on crate training for potty training: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj6oYjcOPuA. This video has additional tips to make the process easier: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvPiFcG7ROI&amp;feature=plcp. Potty training takes a couple of months. And there will probably be a month or so when your pup won't be able to hold it for the entire night. That means you'll have to get up around 4am every night to let them out. For a month. Be prepared. And there will be accidents (lots). This is by far the best product to clean them: http://www.ilovenaturesmiracle.com/home/index.php (you can get it at Petsmart or Petco). I figured out that I needed to reserve the best treats for potty training. Lola responded real quick to that. Every time she went to the bathroom

As far as toys: try to buy rubber or rope toys. Puppy teeth will shred anything soft. Also, shoes, and pillows. If they only ever get rubber or rope toys, they're less likely to think pillows are toys. My favorite brand is Kong: http://www.kongcompany.com/. Their toys are pretty much indestructible. I always have a chew toy, and a ""thinking"" toy out for Lola. The more toys you leave out, the less they'll chew on your stuff. BUT, dogs get bored. Buy like 10 good toys and keep them on rotation. Only 2 or 3 out at a time

As far as playing, even accidentally, stop playing and say no. They should only be biting toys.  If your dog does bite you and it bites too hard (means it didn't learn bite inhibition as a puppy) make sure you ""yelp"" and ignore. Basically, dogs learn bite inhibition (aka ""I can only bite so hard before it hurts them"") when they're puppies. Sometimes they don't learn it though (usually when they're taken away too young). So you have to act like its siblings or mother would to teach it. The pup's siblings would yelp and stop playing with the pup if it bit too hard. So if your pup bites you hard make a high pitched ""yeeep"" and then turn away for a minute or so. Dogs don't generally remember what they're being punished for after a minute, so don't extend it beyond that. Also, if the dog gets super hyper, stop playing. I thought it was cute when Lola got crazy excited. But excitement slowly turned into anxiety/aggression. Let your dog get all into it, stop.

Oh, it will want to chew on EVERYTHING. If you give it a cold frozen toy, the pup will chew on that because it will make their gums feel better. Also, don't leave the tug-of-war or tennis ball out. The dog will be far more interested in playing with these toys if they are reserved specifically for tug and fetch. Oh, and never ever ever buy your dog raw hide. Dogs can't digest raw hide. They just bite off pieces and those pieces pass through their system undigested. If your dog chews off too big of a piece, it can choke or cause intestinal blockage (which can kill it, worst case, but why risk it? Your dog don't care if it gets rawhide or a pb&amp;j stuffed Kong toy. Just for realz stay away from raw hide.

These things aren't necessary

This is the list of things I bought for the pup when I fist adopted her: a crate (must be the right size for it to work for potty training), small treats for training, delicious treats for potty training (REAL meat or cheese), dog food, 2 dog bowls (buy this kind if your puppy eats way too fast: http://www.petsmart.com/search/index.jsp?kwCatId=&amp;kw=slow%20feed%20dog%20bowl&amp;origkw=slow+feed+dog+bowl&amp;sr=1&amp;f=PAD/psNotAvailInUS/No), poo bags, dog shampoo and wet wipes (for when it sits/walks in its own puppy diarrhea...WILL happen), foaming toothpaste (I like http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11888862&amp;f=PAD%2FpsNotAvailInUS%2FNo), a collar (don't spend too much on the collar; you'll have to buy a bigger one in 6 months)

About 6 months later I bought Lola: a collapsable water bowl for when we go on long walks or hikes, tennis balls, a frisbee, and a christmas sweater.

As far as feeding: don't buy off-brand kibble. That stuff is shit and your dog would never, but you generally feed less of the nice kibble because it has more nutrients:mass. I cook for my dog now, but when I fed kibble I really liked Wellness and Blue Buffalo Wilderness. They're easy to find and not totally crap. This website rates dry dog food http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/dry/5-star/ and wet dog food: http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/dry/5-star/. Some people are all into raw food. My thought on this: your pup eats raw chicken. Then it kisses you in the mouth (you don't ask for this, but pup will deliver). That gives me the eebies. But, whatever you're into (salmonella). If anyone out there wants to cook for their pup, let me know and I'll send you my recipe. Whatever you do, don't feed your dog Science Diet. That stuff gave Lola the NASTIEST gas of all time. It was relentless.

Now I'm worried she could've ingested some of the residue and it could've effected her because I assume her brain is still forming. Could this happen?? What should I look for? My dog is a six month old shelter dog.

Guy - ""He looks dangerous. Pittbulls are known to be dangerous.""

Friend - ""All he did was turn his head to sniff in your direction

Woman - ""Dogs of that breed are mean and attack unprovoked. How are we to know he's not trained to attack?""

Friend - ""Let me get this straight

Guy - ""I apologize. What are the dogs names?""

I'm an illustrator by trade and occasionally find myself with a little free time and have been known to do dog caricatures in this time on a commissioned basis.

The images cost £6.50 (roughly $9.88) for a black and white sketch (slightly more for a coloured one) - [full info available here](http://kovahs.blogspot.co.uk/p/pet-caricatures_15.html) including a donation to a dog charity.

Colour are £8 (Roughly $12.17)

They are digitally done and I will email you a A5 sized print ready copy and a smaller internet friendly one.

I only take paypal for these.

If you are interested please drop me an email - katy@kovah.co.uk 

I will need several photos of your dog for reference and a little paragraph about your dog so I can get a sense of their personality.

Here are a couple of examples there are more on the link above:

[Jack](http://i.imgur.com/jPyaTjx)

[Tyson](http://i.imgur.com/7iPk5B2)

If this isn't allowed on /r/dogs I apologise but I couldn't find anything that said otherwise as they are not photos of my dog.


**EDIT:**

Thankyou to all those who have sent me an email I will get back to you asap!

For anyone yet to send me one

**EDIT 2:**

Wow I had a lot more interest than I had anticipated

**EDIT 3:**

Just as there has been a little confusion with a few people Euros (EUR) are not the same as English Pounds £ (GBP)
