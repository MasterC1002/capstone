Anyone else feel this way?

""Just ask for a gift card"" is not the solution - I don't want to worry about spending a gift card. I don't want a monetary exchange. I also don't want to have to worry about exceeding or equalling another's monetary gift.

I'm tired of buying over-processed crap that can easily be hand made as it has for thousands of years. I like controlling what goes into my body. I admit this reduces but does not eliminate my dependency on consumerism.

Also

What's really amazing is how my friends are surprised making yogurt is so easy. Look it up on Google. If a peasant in Bulgaria with no concept of bacteria could make it 1

Basic instructions:

1. Buy the last container of yogurt you will ever need (how ironic you need to do this in order to be independent). Make sure it's as plain and pure as possible. Balkan style is best IMO.

2. Heat milk (preferably local

3. Cool milk to 43C and add 2 tbsp room-temperature yogurt per liter milk as a starter culture. Stir well.

4. Cover vessel with foil (good insulator) and place it a warm space for 8 hours. An oven with the light on works great.

5. Stir yogurt, 1 L milk makes 600 mL yogurt).

Note: Always save a little bit as starter for your next batch.

Now you have healthy and tasty yogurt for the cost of milk plus a little electricity/gas for the rest of your life. Holy hell

Next week

1374008639.0,1ifuia,Achievement unlocked: I'm no longer captivated by shiny things on sale! I just kept $60 in my pocket during my lunch break.,inquiringmindsfap,120,18,39,"I used to be the ultimate superficial consumerist.  I always bought the latest expensive fashions

I endeavored to educate myself, and modestly worn down from about 3 years of daily use.  I NEVER change my purse (unless traveling when I need a bigger bag).  I also have plain black Calvin Klein pumps that have also lasted me for 3 years (wear about 4x a week).  One day my cat chewed on the tip a little bit.  It didn't even phase me, and I've kept on wearing them.  Take that, superficial women! I won't play your game! 

So I've learned to slowly temper down my buying habits. But today I had that marvelous breakthrough moment, and go to that store to pick up some more.  I find my cream and look at the label... $15.00.  I didn't even think about it, I just put it in my basket and resigned myself to the purchase.  Then I saw a sign ""Buy 2 get 1 free!"".  I thought... Oooooh, free stuff!  Then I actively searched for the other thing I had to buy to get my free item, and then searched for the free item I'd get.  I put all 3 things in my basket.  

So then I'm walking around some more

I gingerly put back all 3 items. I realized that this store almost sucked away $60 of my hard earned cash, it makes shaving a breeze.  But you know what ... $15 on shower cream... I just can't do it anymore. And I won't.  

So from now on I'm going to use my regular store-brand Vitamin E soap from Whole Foods that costs $1.50... it's soft and sumptous

Money in my pocket!

less stress at work, stress (and money) commuting to work, stress from co-workers, deadlines, bosses, social expectations about jobs, it goes on and on. society isn't better off producing more widgets

For instance, it was expensive and I wanted to get as much life out of the product as possible, but I have to say, it was an effort. Because smartphones are still something of a nascent market which is still seeing massive innovations, my phone was practically useless even before the contract time was up. Applications would not run, and as software was updated, even basic functions became a struggle. The last 6 months of its life, I realized that this was because the changes are coming so fast to the devices

Which led me to another thought, it shows. As far as I'm concerned, this thing is *almost* as fast and functional as the day I bought it, but there will come a time when some of my larger, more resource heavy programs like database applications and recording software won't run efficiently. (Luckily I'm not a ""gamer"" or my computers would only last 6 months.) No matter what condition the hardware is in, I will reach a point where the people making software on the faster, newer machines will no longer be able to practically support older machines. Working in IT

I guess my question is this: what can be done about the monetary and material waste regarding objects which are not superficially, but innovation will always produce ""waste."" For instance, car produced 70 years ago that was made to last 75 years would still be perfectly adequate for the job. But if there were a sudden innovation in our transportation infrastructure (transition to alternate energy sources, for instance, or ""fly cars"" or something) we'd have a nation full of obsolete gas guzzlers. Like my computer, they'd still be fully *functional*, but essentially *purposeless*. Not the best analogy so please don't take it literally.

 My friends and I were really in the mood to get out of the house and spend some time together. If this was summer

Our group today consisted of four adults and a toddler. We wanted some place indoors with a lot of walking space. Someone mentioned the mall and at first we all cringed because none of us are traditional consumers. Then we actually thought about it. If you can get past the idea that you have to buy things at a mall

When we got to the mall it was completely decked out for Christmas. My daughter really enjoyed looking at all the decorations. There were countless Christmas trees and even a Santa's village with reindeer! In addition to the Christmas decorations

 When we got hungry we headed over to the food court - and unpacked our lunches we had brought from home. There were so many people doing different things that no one paid us any mind. Besides

We went into quite a few of the stores and found ways to enjoy their contents without bringing anything home. My favorite was a store with little statues and figurines of various types. I thought of how nice it was to go through and look at them all, etc). Other favorites included coffee shops and a chocolate store. The aromas were amazing. I learned to appreciate the smells as a thing in and of themselves, without them leading up to buying and eating something.

Our last good find was a free play area for kids. My daughter squealed and crawled around for quite awhile while the adults rested. There were even other kids there for her to play with.

Just to summarize, a place to sit down and eat, and lots to look at. Let's not forget the opportunity for people-watching! Then add in the idea that all of this is inside a heated building that is open for most of the day with restrooms. We were there for 5 or 6 hours and I didn't buy a single thing!

Tl;Dr - if we get over the idea that we have to buy things at the mall and look at it in a completely different way,False,self,t5_2r83n,False,,,t3_nat8t

60 days?  This person thinks it's normal for a wallet ($45) to last for *60 days?*

There's a way that we resign ourselves to living in a world not of our making. In a land that's a democracy

So I'm encouraging you to examine **all** of the ways that you are being kept down

I'm of the belief that capitalism needs this paralysis, but we all do it anyway. You want to look at what kind of messages are being spread? Who spreads them? Over what networks? All commercial networks, with their own interests in selling shit and not an ounce in anything else. The world is driven by money first. Everything else seems incidental.

1373939947.0,1idteq,Anticonsumption and the importance of outlook,surger1,50,9,10,"Consumption is the result of the systemic destruction of our sense of community. Western economics is founded on the idea of destroying community for the purpose of economic growth. Framed from the other angle we call it advertising.

Advertising since the early 1920's has diverged from solving peoples problems to creating problems to be solved by peoples purchases. Which is a fundamental shift in power. If you are purchasing a product not to solve a problem you have

However that state of existence expired decades ago. We are now experiencing the issue of a population that is dependent on corporations to solve their problems. You see it everywhere

It's an example of how dis empowered people have become. If we want some sort of experience we would rather beg and whine for it then do it ourselves. Of course this came about due to patent and copyright laws. Which are now used to control the system. Where success is best determined not by what you do but who you are partnered with. Can't have a tech company not partnered with Microsoft because then you would never be able to afford all the operating systems. Can't have a sports team not partnered with XYZ. Suddenly the patents and copyrights are not defenses but economic weapons. Giving those with money the most sway because no one can possibly go against you with your mighty patents and copyrights.

This is of course going further than technology. Chain stores are economic vacuums. That drain resources from one area and bloat to a few actors in the system. Take Tim Hortons in Canada. There is essentially 1 Tim Hortons for every 5000 canadians

Consumption has become a fact in western society. I understand why this group is Anti-consumption but to be Anti-consumption is to be anti society right now. I Firmly believe that we are never going to get past consumerism by fighting it. We have to get past it by ignoring it. We are entering an era where many tactics previously used to control the free markets are going to be having new problems. 3D printing is one, increased education, increased connectivity. 

All of these things pose issues to consumption. We cannot fight them with the rules they have now. It's impossible

Advertising works at the moment because we have no community. People are not connected and do not feel invested in their neighbours

The big issue is currently there is a conflict that much of the community talent is being used to create corporate capital and the communities do not benefit. These people are trying to capitalize on the sense of community and this causes it to be counter intuitive as capital is the anti-thesis of community. Capital promotes the idea that you are removed from your responsibility to your community through capital. You pay X amount so you are thereby freed from certain social obligations. Community is the idea that you ensure your neighbor has enough to eat before sitting down to your own meal. Capitalism simply does not work as well when people support each other. The less support the more they require your goods and services.

So let's focus on anti-capitalism through the reconstruction of our sense of community and empowerment. Maybe today we could start a project that would begin to bring the power back to the people. We do not have a consumption problem, the only way people in our society can have power is through money. However the one thing we have that is free is each other. Because what you and I decide to do of our own accord is our business. If we can reconnect people then we can start to end this outrageous consumption.

The stage is being primed for it too. High unemployment, let's grow the new system in the old one and watch as the other one dies its natural death.

Whatever each us may be looking for, we buy political pamphlets and bumper stickers. Somehow we assume that having all the right accessories will get us the perfect lives. And when we construct our lives, we often do it according to an image, a pattern that has been laid out for us: hippie, businessman, housewife, punk.

Why do we think so much about images today, unlike activities, images are easy to sell. Advertising and marketing, which are designed to invest products with a symbolic value that will attract consumers, have transformed our culture. Corporations have been spreading propaganda designed to make us believe in the magic powers of their commodities for generations now: deodorant offers popularity, soda offers youth and energy, jeans offer sex appeal. At our jobs, energy, we end up selling parts of our lives away. We keep going back, that vacation cabin with matching rugs) will be the one that will fix everything.

We are easily persuaded to chase these images because it is simply easier to change the scenery around you than it is to change your own life. How much less trouble, at the right parties, drinking the right beers and wearing the right informal dress shirts) rather than pursuing the desires themselves—for of course it's easier to identify yourself with a prefabricated image than to identify exactly what you want in life. But if you really want adventure, an Australian hunting jacket won't suffice, and if you want real romance, dinner and a movie with the most popular girl at your school might not be enough.

Fascinated as we are by images, forever. And yet we keep looking for life in pictures, in fashions, in spectacles of all kinds, anything that we can collect or watch—instead of doing.

WE LOOK FOR LIFE IN THE IMAGE OF LIFE.


Watching from the Sidelines
The curious thing about a spectacle is how it immobilizes the spectators: just like the image, and ultimately their lives around something outside of themselves. It keeps them occupied without making them active, it keeps them feeling involved without giving them control. You can probably think of a thousand different examples of this: television programs, action movies, magazines that give updates on the lives of celebrities and superstars, spectator sports, representative ""democracy

A spectacle also isolates the people whose attention it commands. Many of us know more about the fictitious characters of popular sitcoms than we know about the lives and loves of our neighbors—for even when we talk to them, and the weather; thus the very experiences and information that we share in common as spectators of the mass-media serve to separate us from one another. It is the same at a big football game: everybody watching from the bleachers is a nobody, regardless of who they are. They may be sitting next to each other, but all eyes are focused on the field. If they speak to each other, it is almost never about each other, but about the game that is being played before them. And although football fans cannot participate in the events of the game they are watching, or exert any real influence over them, they reconstruct their desires to revolve around the things they pay attention to. Their language even conflates the achievements of the team they identify themselves with with their own actions: ""we scored a goal!"" ""we won!"" shout the fans from their seats and sofas.

This stands in stark contrast to the way people speak about the things that go on in our own cities and communities. ""They're building a new highway, who have made the world the way it is—it is we, humanity ourselves. No small team of scientists, city planners, and rich bureaucrats could have done all the working and inventing and organizing that it has taken for us to transform this planet; it has taken and still takes all of us, working together, to do this. We are the ones doing it, our jobs

We might have more success in our pursuit of happiness if we start trying to really participate. Rather than trying to fit images, society, and life, it is up to each of us to figure out how to play an active and significant part in creating the worlds around us and within us. Perhaps one day we can build a new society in which we can all be involved together in the decisions that affect the lives we lead; then we will be able to truly choose our own destinies, instead of feeling helpless and left out.

What's the point of doing anything
if nobody's watching?

We all want to be famous, preserved in the media, because we've come to trust what is seen more than what is actually lived. Somehow we've gotten everything backwards and images seem more real to us than experiences. To know that we really exist, that we really matter, we have to see ghosts of ourselves preserved in photographs, on television shows and videotapes, in the public eye.

And when you go on vacation, spending their ""time off"" seeing the world through a tiny glass lens. Sure, turning everything that you could experience with all five senses into recorded information that you can only observe from a distance, detached, offers us the illusion of having control over our lives: we can rewind and replay them, over and over, until everything looks ridiculous. But what kind of life is that?

We are already what I would consider frugal and mindful of not buying unneeded items. Pre-children we didn't even fuss with Christmas for a few years and I personally found it liberating. We now have kids and have allowed ourselves to do the Santa bit. I tried to keep it reasonable and only bought items I knew they would really value and use. So in the end I think I did ok. Lot's of books for my 6 year old and the likes. 

I'm curious to hear from those of you who are parents and have adopted anitconsumption as your way, but she will still have her needs met. I'm trying to set her up to learn how to create income producing opportunities for herself. 

Thanks in advance for feedback and please be kind Reddit

""Why do you want to have a baby with me? You can’t stand me.""

Awkward silence — Meryl’s eyes light up with an idea as she turns around

(in a peppy

""Why don’t you let me fix you some of this new Mococoa drink? All natural cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua

""What the hell are you talkin’ about?"" Looks around incredulously — “Who are you talkin’ to?"" Truman asks deliberately as his eyebrows shoot up and his irises dart left to right along with his head; Truman suppinates both of his palms  — almost begging that she present some person

""I’ve tasted other cocoa’s; this is the best

""— the hell does this have to do with anything, and nearly yells the end of the sentence “Tell me what’s HAPPENING!""

""Well, a failure to understand what Truman seeks — an inability to give it to him or even comprehend its importance.


Truman’s eyes squint and his finger pointedly

Meryl pulls out her consumer product threateningly. The “Chef’s Pal"", peeler. “Truman.""

Truman gasps

""You. Are. Scaring me."" Meryl swings the tri-pronged Chef’s Pal from left to right

Truman just shakes his head

Truman jukes left, like one would apprehend a hostage in front of a gunman. 

Truman struggles to pull the utensil from her hands, what she has given away. The epiphany, for Truman, causes him to furrow his brow in disbelief — his mouth hangs slightly open, speechless. He looks beyond her, not at her. 

And, this climax, is not being directly portrayed. You’ve been put into the position of another spectator. We subjectively watch someone else watching television. In other words, you’re not watching the moment, you’re watching another television depict the moment. Beyond merely being removed from the moment, you are subjected to the point of view of a spectator living in the world in which The Truman Show exists as a form of entertainment — a mixture of advertising, life

The big lie in our society (...) is that people freely take employment. A choice between degradation and starvation is not a free choice (a point made by the anarchist theorist Mikhail Bakunin in the 19th century). 

Might we understand consumerist obsession as a form of compensation for this lack of real freedom? One has very little control over the important things, but she can go shopping, and in the act of buy or not buying, have the momentary sensation of agency.

Might this be an explanation for the phenomenon of compulsive shopping: Where people run up massive debts buying things that they don't need, and more in needed. 

This then serves to bind them more closely to their servitude

I got to thinking

However

So that's where I'm coming from. This is where I get confused though. It says in the side bar:

It is a HUGE jump from ""I value freedom and independence"" to ""consumption is ruining people's lives""

I certainly think that there is a tendency for people to be inundated into making unwise decisions, in your opinion, is the exact problem with consumption? What does ""conspicuous consumption"" mean to you? How big of a problem do you think (conspicuous) consumption is? How would you go about remedying it? Do you think people can figure this out for themselves or do you think some ""intervention"" is needed?

I realize these are broad questions, after all! ;)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Stuff"" 

Stuff. I used to have a lot of it: knickknacks on book shelves; a closet full of clothes of which I wore only 20 percent of, and pots and pans to accommodate a five person household (though, when I wasn’t living alone, I only had one roommate). Having this amount of stuff was normal by most standards. I was living the status-quo. Buying stuff felt good, if not just for that temporary moment. The new toy I had to have, new bedding, another IKEA bookshelf to hold the other stuff I had and would acquire in the future, which I had likely already seen and would watch at most once more. It just felt nice to have the collection on the chance that someone would want to watch it

I cannot remember the exact time I noticed, such as how long it took to clean and organize my living space, or the amount of crap on bookshelves and bathroom countertops that seemed to collect a volcanic eruption worth of dust on them overnight. To an extent, I like things to have their place and be relatively clean. But unlike others that are more seriously affected with obsession-compulsion, there was a point where the time and effort involved in making sure all of those things were in their place was not worth the outcome. I suppose keeping on top of it would make it seem like less effort, but in reality, it’s just diffusing it.

But worrying and working to keep all the stuff organized and clean was not the only reason for the growing discomfort. There was another reason that was a psychologically deeper issue. One specific incident that I remember quite well, a kind of depression set in. This was not my room, or my home. It was not familiar. I liked the efficiency and aesthetics of the new layout better, but something didn’t sit right. This thing was over here and that stack of stuff was now over there. I didn’t recognize it. I didn’t really give much thought as to why I was feeling this way at the time – it could partially have been a fear of change to some extent, but either way it was just stuff changing location and I let it cascade into a giant snowball of anxiety over the next few days. Similar episodes were brought on by moving. Soon enough though, the anxiety of my changed surroundings began to fade and within a few days, things felt normal again. Though

Why did I have all this stuff? We all need a certain amount of stuff. Food, or they held some sort of sentimental significance. For me, the sentimental value category can be further broken down into two additional subcategories: gifts, photos or handmade pieces from people close to the heart; or items that represent a moment or experience. The former are clearly sentimental. The latter were less so, but still enough to make parting with them difficult. I look back now, and although I understand why it was difficult, I still laugh at myself for having a hard time letting go of that shelf full of Ichiro or Edgar Martinez bobble-head dolls I collected as one of the first 15

Sometime during my years at university, asking myself if I really needed them. The process itself wasn’t conscious, but a new round of purging would happen when I still wasn’t happy with the amount of stuff I had left over from the last time I downsized. Only now from this point in time can I look back and see that it was indeed a long process of not only getting rid of things, but becoming less attached to material possessions. Each iteration would prove to be a tougher test as I peeled away layer after layer of things that increasingly had more sentimental value attributed to them. Several passes couldn’t get rid of those bobble-head dolls or movies I never watched. But after a while, they eventually went. For the bobble-head dolls, and other souvenirs that represented fond memories, it was a matter of asking whether or not these things really complimented the actual memories. My answer was always no. In the end, but at that point, or complete my set of limited edition baseball memorabilia. Companies fully understand the desire to collect

For me, the information age has made the task of organizing, consolidating and storing these much easier. No more boxes full of pictures or photo sleeves full of 35mm negatives. No more bookshelves or CD binders packed with easily-damaged video or audio media. Now digitally consolidated, they take up no more space than a small portable hard drive. One day, these may all go into online storage and take up an even smaller footprint.

Before traveling, a mountain bike, a small amount of clothes and shoes which all get equal attention, a laptop, a kindle, one LCD TV, and a few totes of stuff that have stuff that I either need to go through or I will eventually need for my next place (silverware, bowls, but it will be done with a new mindset – one that realizes all that all I really need are a roof over my head

In the end, but the famous Fight Club quote still heavily resonates with me: “the things you own, end up owning you.” The stuff I had dictated a lot of my life. I had a lot of stuff, so I needed larger and larger accommodations or storage to contain and maintain it. Larger accommodations and more maintenance meant more recurring expenses. More recurring expenses meant less money available for things I actually enjoyed and also the dreadful feeling of being bound to a particular career or line of work because it paid well, regardless of my dislike and unhappiness in it.

Now, I happily accepted gift cards or cash. It was understandably a little uncomfortable for them to have me sit there and watch the rest of the family open gifts while I had nothing. Though, I was perfectly happy. I am perfectly content just spending holiday time in the company of close friends and family. Not having to sort through a box of gifts, wondering where I was going to put everything, was a relief. It was even better knowing that what I did receive – gift cards and cash – I could use for practical purposes or put towards a vacation (or in this particular case, funding a year long, sell-everything

I also worked hard to eliminate debt, and less that I don’t. I no longer have a huge ball-and-chain dictating my life. I now have the ability to choose any line of work that I am happy doing, regardless of how lucrative it is or isn’t. It now seems that that world of possibilities that people talk about does actually exist.

I made some truly wonderful friends while traveling – specifically in Eastern Europe – where this kind of problem would be laughed at. It’s also overused and cliché, I now see how a culture of fear and consumption has affected me.

As a disclaimer, then that is what matters. My changes were for me and me only. If what I am saying strikes a chord with you, then take what you want and leave what you don’t. If that still isn’t clear enough, let me be blunter: I do not give one single fuck how you choose to live your life as long as you are not taking that ability away from someone else. This statement applies not only to this particular aspect of life, but in all, and will likely be referred to in future entries.",,self,,

1321239079.0,mbd6g,One of my childhood experiences with advertising. Anyone else want to share theirs?,Draco9793,20,2,15,"When I was in Elementary School, many advertisements got into my head and stayed there for years

The most vivid example I can remember is a TV commercial for a life sized toy dog attached to a leash. It was a miniature something or other with long white hair and there was a flip switch on the end of the leash to turn it on and make it walk. The ad on TV showed a group of girls walking down a city sidewalk talking and laughing while walking this ridiculous toy dog. I had REAL dogs at home that I could play with or take for walks whenever I wanted! Having a real live dog would have been any other kid's dream. But I wanted that toy so badly that I begged my parents for months to buy it for me. They initially refused because they knew I wasn't going to play with it and it was pretty expensive by today's standards

Let me pause for a moment and give you some helpful background information. I grew up as an only child. We lived in the mountains outside of town where the houses were at least half a mile apart if not more. Going into town for groceries

Fast forward to the TV commercial with the little white dog. Looking back on it now I understand. The ad made me envision living in a city where I could just walk out the front door and spontaneously meet friends. I imagined being able to walk down the block to a friend's house or ride a bike to school. Even though I very much enjoyed my life in the mountains

So anyway

What are some of your experiences with advertising? When you were growing up did anyone teach you about advertising or how to avoid it? I believe advertising to small children should be illegal because they dont have the maturity needed to sort through the mess of thoughts and emotions caused by advertising. Everyone's experience is different though and I'd love to hear about someone else's.

**Tl;Dr** - When I was a child I saw an ad for a toy on TV. I desperately wanted the toy, I did not realize the extent of psychological manipulation going on.  Anyone else have any experiences to share?

That's what I'm questioning here - is it possible for a capitalist society, but are not needed to provide for everyone else - but as we're a capitalist society, those people need to work to make the money to buy the things they require to survive, so they then have to make and provide things and services that aren't needed.  These then have a need to be sold to people, and so on.

In other words, then we need to find reasons for everyone to work to earn that money.  People are pushed to consume to make sure that others get paid to produce, just because that's the only way that most people can have the jobs they need to stay alive.  If the majority of people were to stop all that excess consumption, it seems like our economy would fall apart, with masses of people out of work, because we've come to depend on an economy of consumption.

Am I wrong here?  I'd really be interested in seeing how capitalism could work without this reliance on consumption - and even better if there are ideas as to how to get there.

1353197030.0,13dia9,What does anticon think of insect-farming to replace meat?,akrabu,21,6,25,"Maybe not in our generation or the next, etc.

One thing we can do in our own lives is replace our meat purchases with meat that we raised on our own. But how do you do that if you live in an apartment? Microfarming insects!

-----------------------------------------

**Here is my guide to building and maintaining insect microfarms**

Since my DIY everything AMA was mostly a bust. I remembered that I once built an indoor insect microfarm that consumed very little and produced a lot of food.

* First off

* **Container:** We used two plastic storage containers that were roughly 20-30 gallons for the enclosures. They were both tall-sided type because crickets duh

* **Air** We drilled a bunch of tiny holes in the lids ala 5 year old catching bugs in their backyard. Good air circulation is important and next time I get serious about microfarming I will be adding low power PC fans to the enclosures and using scraps of window screen in the build.

* **Heat and Light:** We added a light socket to each enclosure and added 5 watt CFLs for light and heat

* **Cricket Bedding:** Crickets need sand to lay their eggs. I would be careful what sand you use. If you buy it at the hardware store, put those particles into clean water, agitate and rinse, then boil those particles and dry them before use. 

* **Mealworm Bedding:** Meal worms live in their food. Whatever cheap quick oats you can find or have laying around works well as a starter bedding. You could use any sort of dry meal though

* **IMPORTANT NOTE ON FOOD:** PESTICIDES! If you peeled something that people do not typically eat the peel of

* **Feed for Crickets:** I haven't found a lot of vegetation that crickets won't eat. If they ate through all of our fruit and vegetable scraps I could just go outside and get a handful of leaves, etc. and they would devour that too. They loved apple cores and when I had a colony of 2,000 or so I could toss one in there and it would be nothing but seeds, stem, and skin in 20 or so minutes. You can't watch them eat because they are afraid of the giant hand in the sky. If you raise them the pet store way they need stupid mineral supplements. They don't have mineral deficiency when you feed them a balanced diet and give them regular yard scraps to eat. The pet store reptile feed crickets are mineral deficient because they feed them a sterile grain food only. Then of course they also get to sell you that mineral powder because they engineered nutrient deficient crickets.

* **Water for Crickets:** Crickets need a water source

* **Mealworm Food and Water:** Mealworms also love apples and they love greens and lettuce. Mealworms do not need water because they will get their water from vegetable scraps. Dandelions are a favorite of theirs too

* **Cricket Tank Features:** Crickets will eat each other. They needs lots of variously sized places to get away from each other and to lay their eggs. Covering the bottom sand with large flat rocks is great for breeding. Also cutting egg cartons in half and stacking them on top of each other loosely into apartments is great and makes harvesting easy. *(Meal worms don't need features and are easy to harvest by hand.)*

* **Harvesting and Preparing Crickets:** Having egg cartons in the cricket enclosure is really the only way I have found to reasonably harvest them. Chasing crickets around by hand is too time consuming. They will come out dirty so toss them in an airtight container and freeze them to knock them out. Be careful, after 5 minutes drop the temperature down to 200 and I don't know exactly how long it takes I never set timers for anything. Maybe 30 minutes? The idea is to kill them quickly with the heat and then dry-roast them, slightly roasted and completely dry. You can season them prior to roasting too. Smoked salt on dry-roasted crickets tastes like bacon bits and even people who said they'd never eat crickets end up chowing on them at parties. There's one more thing you need to do after roasting before you eat them. You should put them all into a brown paper bag and shake the fuck out of it to knock off all of their legs and other pokey parts. Then sift those out in a colander. You can eat the legs, but they will stab you in the gums in all kinds strange ways.

* **Preparing Mealworms:** Dry roasted they are good

I have a video on a backup drive of the farms. I will be attempting to rescue that data later this evening.

Five things:

1. I apologize for not keeping things up to date and staying in better touch. Being new prevents me from communicating at a decent pace, in the knowledge that I am seldom successful. ;)

2. The first plan of NexGen_Alliance was to be private and selective in who would submit posts, the reddit is now public. Soon, I will try to obtain the assistance of /pimpmyreddit and other such communities.

3. I come with this message bearing gifts. These texts will provide us with a starting point from which to brainstorm:

* https://rapidshare.com/files/291702503/BeautifulTrouble.pdf
* https://rapidshare.com/files/913044070/re-imaginingChange.pdf

4. A user by the name of keskiyonaurinko submited an excellent idea of setting up a kind of sidebar directory like /r/shitredditsays and its subreddits have. I will be in contact with /reddithax to figure out how to do it. If there are any other suggestions for the sidebar

5. It has been made very clear to me that we need some kind of plan of action to effect change in the world. However, we must quantify our concerns. We must number and itemize those things which is tugging at our heartstrings and compels us to join up. IMHO, we must focus our crosshairs on the following things:

* The idea that everything is somebody else's problem. ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somebody_Else%27s_Problem#Psychology))
* Learned helplessness ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness))
* Cultural Hedgemony ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony))
* Instrumental rationality ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_rationality))
* Repressive desublimation ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressive_desublimation))
* Capture bonding ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome))
* The lack of fully mutual knowledge ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_knowledge_(logic)))
* Enforced dependency (A term sociologists use for the creation of a class or group of people who are forced to rely on another more powerful class or group for the essentials of life.)
* Reductionism in Education
* The Baroque Mentality (A mindset characterized by a focus on eccentric redundancy and noisy abundance of details)

My username is NexusXtremeOne

I got out of college just when the economy crashed. I'm sure many here have experienced the problems described in the most recent issue of Newswseek (http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/07/15/are-millennials-the-screwed-generation.html) Upset

Then I saw this: (http://2wanderlust.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/futurism-got-corn-graph-631-thumb.jpg?w=450&amp;h=368)

From the day we were born, and everyone was special. Tyler Durden elaborated upon it:

&gt;*""I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.""*

Long story short: Our generation and our future is doomed to the same scenario John B. Calhoun created in his mouse utopia.

That is why I am making this proposal. An alliance between subreddits with the aim of finding salvation for our generation and world. The Occupy movement has good ideas

1339016587.0,uolbr,Thoughts on OverConsumption: Is the Government responsible?,theorymeltfool,32,20,43,"In response to this thread over on /r/politicaldiscussion: [When did Greed become an American Value

&gt; As a society

I think this occured when politicians were able to step in and break up monopolies, customers liked the Rockefellers and other big companies because they provided cheap services. It was the *competitors* that named them ""Robber Barons,"" and donated to politicians that enacted laws to help them beat these so-called Robber Barons. This is when companies had to start lobbying in order to fight back against the political encroachment. And now things are all fucked up. 

Your question is also very loaded. What do you mean by 'expense of lives and our country'? Our government has been killing far more people than corporations ever could. The entire reason why our country is going down the economic hole is due to politicians and the Government.

&gt; The US ones are far more focused on money and materialism

I don't think it's fair to make a blanket statement like this. Costco is very focused on bringing the best products to their customers at a reasonable price. So is Target. Patagonia recently released an ad stating that it's not a good idea to buy too much of their products if the customer can't afford it.

&gt; which psychologically makes people less concerned with each other. The article cites a few studies which show a link between this.

I think a lot of this has to do with Government. This was talked about on /r/anarcho_capitalism a few months ago. When people are forced to rely on government for charity and services, (social security) helping poor people, (Medicaid and Welfare) helping old people, (Medicare) and a myriad of other Government programs makes people subservient to the Government, and makes others blind to their plight, since they think ""I already paid for Welfare, what are you crying to me for?"" If people kept more of their money, and that is what the Government and Politicians can't ever understand.

&gt; Turns out focusing on materialism instead of community stimulates a different sensation of reward in the brain.

Yup

&gt; Thus

Blame the Government. You can't do *anything* in this country without having to pay taxes. The Government is the entity that is focused on profits, have a farm, and sustain yourself. Since it's illegal to do that unless you live on the street, not that many people are able to. This is why the Government has been increasing in size since forever, and also the reason why they keep printing more money to keep financing all of their wars and other bullshit. No corporations (except for banks, technically, even though this is only possible because they are backed by the Government) are allowed to just print money. The Government is so hell-bent on Consumption that it needs to *print money* in order to survive. And,000, or any amount of companies

If you want strong communities


**TL;DR:** I think the Government is responsible for our 'consumerist' culture
