Just because Brady is always smirking around in fancy hats and Belichick looks like a disgruntled little wizard (these cannot be denied). And because you win. A lot. Is that so wrong?

I mean look at that score over on the right. 52 to 28? with the turnovers you had? You made my team look like a joke. And decided to do it in presumably the hardest way possible. The **only** thing the Bills D had done right before the game was stop the run effectively. It's like Belichick went in the locker room and said ""it'll be too easy if we beat them with Brady. Let's see if we can run it too"". And he did. For over two hundred yards. Without Mankins. Belichick turned our Dline into swiss cheese.

And Brady? He speaks for himself. Got over 300 yards against our D easily. Working with one limited tight end and a WR squad which had questions surrounding it before the game. He makes his teammates better in a way that almost nobody in the game ever has before. Constantly pulling it off with WRs that are under 6'. Constantly pulling it off with zero running game and often zero defense. Ridiculous.

I came here to say this.

However, and nothing would make me happier on my birthday weekend than for you guys to kick the ever-loving shit out of the Jaguars.

So

Welker...break out the stickiest pair of gloves you've got and catch a thousand passes for a million yards. I expect this to be done by halftime. 

Mayo

Arrington...whatever comes most naturally as you play cornerback

Thank you all in advance for what I anticipate to be a wonderful time of ass-stomping.

Terrell Suggs

""These are the most arrogant pricks in the world starting with Belichick on down.""

""Tell them to have fun at the Pro Bowl. Arrogant F---ers.""

""That's funny

And then apparently he calmed down:

""All BS aside they are a hell of a ball club ... They have the right to be arrogant.""

Classy. (*sarcasm*)

Really, don't say anything at all.' This probably sounds childish to some, but I think it's respectful, and I like it. 

A reporter asked Deion Branch what he though about Suggs' comments

'“I don’t know. I think, “they won the game. I’ll leave it at that. Champions carry themselves a little different. If you talk to Ray (Lewis) it might be a little different. If you talk to some other guys, they are champions. That’s not how a true champion talks, regardless of whether you win or lose. It just doesn’t work that way. But congratulations to the Ravens.’’'

Thank you Deion, in general, some class. Something that seems to be lacking in a few of Baltimore's players (looking at you Ayanbadejo.)

It was 31-3. We were dead in the water. But you know what? We fought. We clawed and ground our way back into that game, there was a lot of bad too. The first half just didn't go our way, and we got burned a few times. But that happens to the best of teams. What separates the best teams from everyone else is their ability to get back on their feet. Did the Texans fight like us? I think not. And this was WITHOUT our biggest red-zone threat. Get Gronk back, and we will be, in my honest opinion, unstoppable.

So, and we just took one of the few teams in the league that DOES intimidate me down to the wire once we stopped screwing ourselves over. We play that game again and we WIN. We WILL win in February! 

TL;DR- We fought and fought hard. We may have come up short, and soon we'll have Gronk back! So smile pats fans, we hung with the best, and if we keep this up, we'll have another problem on our hands...

More like where the fuck were you on that pass rush as Brady RUSHED FOR A FIRST DOWN SON? Be it Welker, Hernandez, Lloyd, or Stalworth ye shall receive a perfect spiral of a completion, because FUCK YOU Brady threw that

I shall speak of the villains the NY Giants who stabbed America in the back TWICE, ok I digress). **RESUME BRADY TRIBUTE** Yet Sad Brady becomes Mad Brady and shows the world why the Patriots are the better team, in the better city, with the better food that holds great QB's with great looks and WR's now in the new 2012 edition that includes a running game and not other franchises with overrated University of Florida QB's named Tebow a very exclusive club of sucking.

The immortality of Tom Brady is well known. Even now as this tribute is being written private scientists hired by Bob Kraft are developing the jar head technology from Futurama in order to preserve Supreme Overlord Head Coach Bill Belichick and Tom ""Who Needs Gronk when you got Pass Precision like this"" Brady's place in the Patriots franchise.

* **Rodgers**: 158 TD vs 43 INT - **3.67 to 1** 
* **P. Manning**: 148 TD vs 66 INT - **2.24 to 1**

* **E. Manning**: 143 TD vs 96 INT - **1.48 to 1**

Here goes.

**STORY**

Regardless of my views on his fashion sense, he could've been wearing 10-inch heels and it wouldn't have mattered given how little he had to move in the pocket. His throws were veritable lasers flying across the field. His mere walking upon the field caused the British's women to cry out of despair; his perfect teeth melted their delicate sensitivities. Seemingly taking after Colin Klein in Morgantown, Handsome Tom committed felonious arson in his torching of the Rams defense. Add in assault for his tearing up of our secondary, and he has suddenly racked up quite a rap sheet across the pond. Even while sitting on the bench his presence inspired the previously porous Patriots defense to morph into a Pro-Bowl quality unit. By whipping his golden locks back on forth He divinely pushed the ball into the hands of a waiting defender. It seemed that Saint Brady, as he shall be forever called, was not human; rather, he was but the Holy one's blessing upon Heathen Europe. Step aside

**POEM**

Oh Tom

I can't even stand t'watch on the telly

Picking and pecking

Our defense into shards - while they're clapping

We call quarterbacks like you MVPs

Oh wait

Anybody want to throw some thoughts down about subreddit improvements? Thoughts? Suggestions?

Me personally

Anyways..2013 looks good for the Patriots as a team as usual.  Not easy to make it to a championship game after a tough SB loss in any respect.

Feel free to chime in...I'd like to see the community more active.  Also I'll stop spamming submissions :).

It seems to me this was more like a patriots team of the glory days--before we were blowing people out by double digits every game. I don't remember too many blowouts during the super bowl winning years; what I do remember were the players shining in the big moments.

Just like Ninkovich against the Jets. That was a true Patriot performance

Also, in his face. 

That picture, fighting and gutting it out like the team hasn't had to in years. 

I realize there are lots of problems to fix, we gutted out our fair share of wins; instead of just ripping into the Pats, lets take a little pride in coming out on top in a tight game.

He has been a pillar in extending the reign of Patriot dominance. He's also one of the best slot receivers ever. He's a perfect player in the Patriot system. He's had great success and there's a bunch of teams that would pay through the nose for him. And the man needs to get paid.

The problem is he's worth too much. He's 31, his role requires him to take gigantic hits. He's not playing into his late 30's, there's a good chance that he has 4 years left at the most. 

To pay Wes his market value, Branch, BJGE, the list goes on and on - it doesn't matter how good you are as a Patriot - you must accept less money.

Wes knows this. He knows it's not fair. And the Pats don't want to lose him. But they know it may happen. So they're bringing in as many guys as they can to illustrate to Wes that they're serious about this. Bring in the former Patriot favorites also serves as a reminder that the Patriot system is good for everyone

This is basically a staring match between the front office and Welker. They want to keep him but don't know if he'll accept terms. They need to find a way out.

I got to watch him be right about that

Now, you're bleeding purple- and if you aren't doing that you're the enemy. Between DC and Baltimore is a unique area where two teams are the local team, but if you're rooting for anything else both Ravens and Redskins fans alike will shun you.

And that's before they find out it's the Patriots you're die-hard for.

The endless taunting of whether or not Tom Brady is into chicks is easy to ward off at first. Believe me, legendary quarterback. When your QB is Rex Grossman or Joe Flacco, the ""Tom Brady sucks"" argument never goes very well.

But alas, cawing about how their team would have decimated the Giants. Snooze.

But it isn't all bad. I can't say there are a lot of Patriots fans around here, similar animals. People who root for the Titans, or the Broncos, even the Giants. Where normally I would jeer a Giants fan, here in Maryland we have a suspended respect for each other. While we might not care for each others teams, we know what its like to be islands in a burgundy and purple sea.

I even high-fived a Jets fan. Once.

I still regret it

Anyway, or out on the coast amongst Raiders fans and Seahawks fans. I might not live near the sacred ground of Foxborough any longer, but I consider my jersey a tiny little piece of it. Even from Silver Spring, Maryland- Sunday is Patriots day.

Sure I'd played Madden before and knew that the Patriots had a pretty accurate QB and a good passing game

By the time the 2011-2012 season started, read ""Patriot Reign"" and done my best to absorb everything Pats related. My first live NFL game was the Patriots vs the Rams at Wembley Stadium in London last season and it was simply amazing to watch Brady sling the ball to Mallet on the sideline.

Right now, we've got the money to retain Vollmer. Pair him with our TE-Party and you have a stellar running game. We may also be able to retain Talib.

Furthermore

We may have lost Welker but we have the greatest coach and QB in the league bar none. There's a reason everyone calls Belichick a sith lord

Denver may have collected a deadly arsenal of receivers but their run game is average at best. When it's time for the playoffs, he's had a lot more mistakes in the playoffs than Brady. 

If we end up in the AFCCG against Denver, I'd probably want to go riot and get wasted. But I won't be surprised. Because Belichick probably drew it up like that.

I wish Wes Welker all the best with the Broncos. He gave us more than we could have asked for. But when we host Denver this season and see Welker at Foxboro decked out in white

We are the New England Patriots. We don't do business like the rest of the league. We will have the last laugh.",self,t5_2rx57,False,,pat-patriot,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Patriots/comments/1a8tbt/we_are_the_new_england_patriots_dont_forget_it/

^ Video of Bob Kraft

This transcends football. All season long, an air about it, a mysticism with it's 2 tight end sets and offensive firepower. This whole season, dedicated to his wife he loved so dear, wanting nothing more than to win her a Super Bowl, a final thank you to a woman who did so much for the team, the community, this season was about Myra Kraft and winning the super bowl for her. The Pats came so close, and saying ""This one's for you

That's all this guy wanted. To bring a final wish to his late wife in the form of another super bowl. I think that's what hurts the most. The blown catches, all of that doesn't matter. What cuts the deepest and cuts the sharpest is the feeling that they didn't get it done for her. Caught on the .gif is the exact moment he realizes the season is over, and that is the reason I can't bear to watch this .gif more than once. Thank you Myra. Thank you Bob. Thank you Patriots.

I can't remember what game it was because it's kind of old, in the video, Brady threw a bullet pass right through the middle without ever seeing the ref and it smacked him right in the face. The ref cam footage was a priceless shot of a football coming straight at the camera and knocking the hat off the ref's head.
