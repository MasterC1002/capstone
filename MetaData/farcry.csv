1358724434.0,16yebh,My alternate idea of the storyline for everyone disappointed in the last half of Far Cry 3 (SPOILERS,wint3r,94,28,27,"Hey Reddit.


Lots of you, and we wanted a big revelation or twist. The game hinted at more. From the menus to the Alice in Wonderland quotes, it always seemed that there was something just out of reach that we didn’t understand. The damn game description says that the island “Holds a dark secret”. Problem is, the end didn’t really address any of that.


So, and that stellar cast?” Here’s what I came up with:


The game opens the same way. That speech was harrowing and gripping


After you break out, all the way up until the fight scene with Vaas. Instead of killing him with the knife, you shoot him in the head when he holds the gun to it and asks you to, and he dies.


You pick up the knife and begin to walk away


“Jason! You fuck! You didn’t really think it would be that easy did you? Look at my fucking arm. Look at this. See this? See this ink? Now look at your arm. Looks the same, I don’t know. But! I know what it means.”


“You can’t die on this island. That’s thanks to Citra. Thanks to my FUCKING SISTER! You, and whoever else comes along and gets tatted up with that fucking magic ink because they think they can stop me. It’s like a little fucking circus. But you know who owns this shit, Jason? Me. I own this island. And no matter how many times you die, how many times I die, or how many times you think you’ve escaped or won, you haven’t. I will be there Jason. I own you. (The following is actually a quote from Vaas the first time he tries to kill you in the fire) ‘It’s really too bad that Citra had to ink you up, because now the only way to kill you is to erase you completely.’”
“Don’t believe me? Aren’t you having trouble keeping your memories straight? Haven’t I killed you three times already


“So go! Conquer the fucking island. Take everything. Hunt the animals. Find the hidden secrets. See how long it lasts. Shoot me again! Why not? Just to see what happens. Play my game


“See that knife, and stabs you in the chest with it, like he initially did when you walked in and he says peekaboo.


You fall down


The intro sequence starts again, are three: One, your tatau is still there. Two, Vaas has the same tatau as you. Three, Vaas’ scar that he has had from the beginning matches exactly where you JUST shot him to kill him.
As he delivers the speech he stops abruptly, Jason”. As he looks at you he bursts out laughing. He then says, “This is just too fucking funny. Look at you there, tied up again and confused. Look at this guy! (He directs the previous statement to the guard nearby). I’m just fucking with you man.”


“Hey, there’s your brother, dead again. Here, you know what? I’ll let you out. And to save you the trouble of rounding up your friends, I’ll just send them over to that fucking doctor’s house again. Because I’m a nice guy, right? Of course I am. I’ll make it that easy for you. And I won’t even kill them before I send them over this time. Maybe next time, but not this time. Think of it as a gift. You can send me a thank you post card from… hmm… oh that’s right! MY FUCKING ISLAND. Get out, forrest

1357023682.0,15rhua,What do we think of the endings? (Spoilers obviously),TheJailbreakKid,60,13,71,"THIS THREAD CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN AS WELL AS BOTH ENDINGS 

Personally. Having played the whole game and done EVERYTHING before I beat the last mission(relics, the whole she-bang) I was fucking pissed at the endings.

I chose the ""save your friends"" option and then later watched the other ending on YouTube and I can honestly say what the fuck. 

First off. The whole game you work to become less of a bible-humping-vagina than you are at the beginning and I can honestly say the transition from total-puss-cake to hardcore-jungle-badass is VERY well done. We slowly see Jason go from being scared and alone to a warrior with an unyielding resolve to save his friends and avenge his dead family members. 

But there lies the problem. By the end of the game you've murdered HUNDREDS  of people who Jason himself says deserve it. You've worked to free these people from their oppression and have become a part of their tribe. 

So the issue is: if you choose the ""save"" option you throw down the knife and tell Citra you want ""no more violence"" and that you've ""killed enough"" even though five minutes ago you were happy as hell lighting an entire small army on fire with a flamethrower and blowing helicopters out of the sky. And then your friends leave you on the island BY YOUR OWN REQUEST because you've ""become a monster and can't return because the anger is still there"" WTF are you angry at Jason?!

And then there's the ""kill"" ending... hoooooly shit this one is fucking weird. Not only has this bitch already raped you once after she got you high on some kind of crazy jungle potion but then for some reason you're suddenly okay with it and grunting and groaning on top of her while she talks to you the whole time about her tribe. Obviously Jason is a shitty lover because that bitch never even flinches as he's screwing her. And then it happens. BAM! Ancient knife through the chest. Even though Jason has been beat, fallen off cliffs, mauled by wild animals and LIT ON FUCKING FIRE this bitch suddenly one-shot-360-yolo-dropshot-swag-scopes your ass with a knife after she tells you she loves you. 

I get the theme of the game is the slow decent to madness. And I get the whole getting-your-ass-kicked-and-living thing is for gameplay purposes but SERIOUSLY? C'mon Ubisoft. 

But then again that's just my opinion. So I want to know yours. Tell me what you guys thought of the endings!

(Most of the time I found stealth to be accurately difficult...sometimes it was ridiculous how they'd find you in the dark from 200 yards away....)  I liked the dark plot

So far...

**I'm enjoying Far Cry 3.  It's fun.  I'm having a blast.**

...

But there are a few things that are driving me crazy. Mostly it all falls under ""hand-holding.""  I wish the game was more challenging.  As it is

* Minimap - I just wish it could be turned off.  It removes too much challenge.  I wouldn't know which way an enemy is facing behind a wall in a firefight.  I wouldn't know which boxes contained valuable loot.  I wouldn't know where every useful plant is in a square mile.  I *loved* the map and compass in FC2.  I with every game had it.  It's my dream mod for Skyrim - a map that I have to equip in one of my hands

* Glowing *everythings* - Again, ammo.  It's so silly.  These are things I should have to *hunt* for.  Skyrim at least had plants that blend in with the world, and if you learn what they look like, then you have some useful knowledge you can put to use to help you in the game.  Again, Skyrim barrels and boxes, some have loot, some don't, I guess to appeal to 12-year old players

* Handholding in quests - I'll try not to spoil it... but in one quest you're given a special compass that is supposed to lead you somewhere.  Instead of using the compass, there is a puzzle to reach a ledge that is too high.... and instead of having me figure it out, each and every step appears as a pop-up with glowing blinking lights to show me the way.  It would have been such a cool challenge, except that it was on-screen ""do this, now this, now this.""  I kind of miss Myst-type games, where you could legitimately be *stuck* for an hour trying to figure out what to do to meet a goal or where to go next.  FC3 would be a far greater challenge with some mystery and problem-solving added.  Or not added even... just take away the hand-holding.

* Characters - FC2 had dark conflicted characters.  These are all a bit cartoony and one-dimensional.  FC2 had fantastic strong women.  These women are all sorority-girl bimbos or island-fantasy sex dolls.  Too bad.  Having a choice between male or female protagonists would have been nice

* Reward balance - For most of the game my ""wallet"" has been full.  I loot everything... and I'm constantly too rich.  I've run out of things to buy, but too bad.  It'd be nice to have something to put money into... a house on the island with upgrades, or more weapon upgrades, or something.  I like the perk tree system...it's a nice addition from FC2.

So... hopefully there will be some magical update down the road that adds a hard-core mode... or someone will figure out some way to mod the game.  I don't imagine Ubi releasing anything even close to Skyrim's Creation Kit.

But... that's my favorite thing about the Elder Scrolls games.  Almost everything about them where I find myself disagreeing with the devs design choice,False,self,t5_2st42,False,,,t3_144xqo

Personally I'm happy with the guns but I would like to see a grappling hook weapon under specials because basically the only way to climb mountains is roads. This could be really cool if it was the gun because you could shoot the gun at someone and reel the body in to hide it. Similarly I would want a harpoon that can be used underwater as well as above so that you could again reel in the shark because I hate hunting those buggers much less swimming to the bottom of the ocean with other sharks to get it. Also rather than whole new weapons maybe these could be special arrows on the bow that way it doesn't take up a whole holster spot.

Jason's friends are subconscious figments and repressions. Jason's enemies are his desires being acted out. The cave is Jason's subconscious where he suppresses the things he doesn't want to deal with. The knife is Jason's penis. As Jason progresses toward manhood he constructs a fantasy. When his reality must be confronted

* Daisy is the mother who is secretly desired, and screw his lover. Got Oedipus? 

* Liz/ Citra are the same character: the lover. Together hey are the true antagonist of the game. Liz is the lover who creates life while diminishing the penis. That's why the cock-stomping nag is in the cave. Citra destroys life by glorifying the penis. We desire to conquer her that she may destroy us. Didn't know sex is scary? Watch ""Eyes wide shut""

* Keith is latent homosexuality. He is only briefly encountered

* Oliver is adolescence. He brings you to the cusp of adulthood (bankrolls the trip)

* Riley is the child self. The only character who occupies a deeper cave than the rest. You think he's dead

* Vass is freedom in all it's glory and dread. He's you being dangerous to yourself (he stabs you with your own dick)

* Hoyt is the power and respect of adulthood. Looks great from a distance

* The Doctor is the fear of old age. His only motivation is regret of his daughters death (the failure to create life). He is life without essence. (He ain't got no knife.) Drug addled and insane

* Dennis is religion. He shows up promising help when your at your most vulnerable, but tries to destroy you if you dare reject it. 

* Buck is sexual perversion. He's competition for control of your penis. 

* Willis the true guide Dennis pretends to be. (Dennis never herd of him) You have to seek him out. He doesn't make any sense

 - Various stylistic UI changes  
 - Various Item changes  
 - ~~Change rebels and villagers to zombies, you could just use the ""Charger"" rebel guys, who only have machetes, just give them a ""bite"" attack instead, AI is the same.

Then suddenly, I admitted I was wrong and took it back.

Well

Why I couldn't have saved my friends and stayed because I was too changed to go back to civilization and my work here wasn't done? I want to stay and help rebuild what has been destroyed. What about saving my friends by sacrificing myself? I can't for the life of me understand how either of the endings we are given were chosen.

I chose to save my friends because I'm not an asshole. This is clearly the better of the two endings, I should get a scene with my friends as well. Tell them I can't go back, I've still got work to do, I still need to find who I am, whatever... At least then I can justify roaming around the island after the end game. Where's my fucking closure?

The ending where you join Citra is fucking awful. The whole idea of whiny frat boy turned seeker-of-vengeance completely snapping and slitting his ex-girlfriend's throat is completely unbelievable, her character simply has not been built up enough for me to accept that this is how bat-shit crazy she is. Yeah, I get she's fucking coocoo at the very end, but this is poor story-telling.

* Unlock no radio towers other than the first one (which is required)

* Inventory upgrades allowed

* No Fast Traveling (note that I'd be doing story mode/item upgrades first and then outposts/quests last

* No camera

* Skill enhancement syringes...I haven't used them much as it is except for the hunting quests, I think the lesser syringes would be a lot more fun if I actually had to use them.

CPU: Intel i5-2500K @ 3.30GHz

I am not expecting this game to run at max settings, I tweaked the game until it worked fine for my standards (30-40fps at 1920x1200). That included changing to DirectX 9 instead of 11 (which helped a lot), settings all the graphical options to high, with the exception of ""Ambient Lighting"", which was at medium. I even installed the latest Beta Driver from AMD.


Now this worked all fine and dandy, unless I am in a very confined space/looking at the ground. And that's also another thing; what I was looking at suddenly had a much larger impact on my framerate. As in, I can no longer look out on large open areas (like out to the ocean, or the view from a mountain top) without getting shit FPS. Even with everything on ""Low"" I still get below 30 fps. And don't get me started on how bad it becomes when I try to fly a paraglider.

I also haven't - according to Steam - exited the game until I close Uplay as well.

The deluxe extras activation - what a clusterfuck that is.  The only reason I knew how to enter the code correctly is from reading the forums a few days ago.  (Enter that code Steam gives you - from the in-game menu - *without* any dashes if you didn't already know.)

That should have been a non-issue.  One activation for Steam, Ubisoft.  Take a page from Gearbox and their Borderlands 2 shift codes if you feel the need to activate additional content.  Don't leave your customers guessing.  That should have been a non-issue from the start.

I see a lot of people having issues with the graphics.  Personally, but the game runs and looks pretty nice on medium settings.  I'm not picky about that though.

The hitboxes (or whatever you want to call them) for looting/skinning are pretty jacked.  I regularly have to strafe around a corpse until the option to loot/skin appears.  Same problem - occasionally - for entering cars or opening doors.

Pathways - walking up the ramps on a radio tower or even walking through a doorway (weapon store
