For Mike, his job, and potentially spending time behind bars. When somebody makes that many risks for a single person, the person in question should be 100% loyal. It's why Harvey was mad at Mike for his decisions at the end of season 2. 

Had Mike not gone back to Harvey, gutless, ungrateful character on television. It sucks to see Louis vulnerable like that, but saying that Mike should stand up for himself would be utterly ridiculous in that situation. ",,False,self,False,t3_1izdba

Now I also believe as much as Mike is turning into Harvey I think Harvey is turning into Mike. Let's look at it physically we saw harvey in casual clothing (not in a suit) at least a handful of episodes in the second season and I believe never in the first. Harvey even begins supporting a less rigid more casual mike-esque haircut toward the end of the second season. Harvey used to never look into the real story and what not of clients and starts to on a couple cases. Harvey starts loosening up even smokes weed with Mike (which was forbidden in the beggining) He starts to show emotion toward others esspecially Donna and I think we realize how important she is when he protects her in mock trial. Toward the end of season two we see Harvey sporting khakis and visiting the grave of his father simultanously contrasted with Mike trying to intimidate Monica into coming forward (the scene where he is called the 'new attack dog') Basically Harvey is softening up

My prediction for the remaining of season 2 and future seasons? Unless all of this is coincidence and based on the brilliant writing of this show I don't think that is the case, who knows what will happen and what problems that'll cause. I'm excited to see more emotion from Harvey as he exposes himself abit from that ""suit"" facade he keeps up.

We walked right through that scene in between shots, we were totally stunned. We were like, Is that who we think it is? What do we do now?

He looked *exactly* the way he looks on tv

We went to lunch (when your wife is pregnant and hungry I guess it isn't that important to stick around in case Sarah Rafferty was there) and came back to gawk and maybe see some other stars, etc. Really interesting to see some behind the scenes stuff.

So how long is it taking them to go from shooting to broadcast? About five weeks? We were wondering when we were going to see that scene come up. Hmph

edit: Smacking my forehead. Wife and I FINALLY got the chance to watch this episode, at any rate. Didn't even realize that was him; while we were walking through the scene I looked to my left and saw a really thin guy in a suit just sort of standing around. I figured he was part of whatever filming was going on because of how, I dunno, *put-together* he looked? He's got a noticeably...flat head. Like if you're looking straight at him, his head is noticeably thinner than if you looked at him in profile. Anyway, it was after that that we glanced to our right, saw Gabriel Macht

Suits has gone more of the way I like, but it isn't really repetitive.

Beyond that, especially regarding development. And with most of these other shows, everyone's role is kind of fixed, and it's interesting with things like the merger and Harvey's play at Managing Partner.

1345004115.0,y8tqr,Who will Louis side with? [SPOILERS],RedVell,25,2,25,"I’m sorry this is so long


Firstly I would like to point out that if this were a movie Louis would vote for Pearson, would be happy with the ending.  However, we must understand that this a TV show, and however great we would feel at the end of such an event it would leave the show unsatisfied for further opportunities.  We would see Harvey doing what he always does, solving cases like nobody’s business - which is awesome, but like the show ‘House’, however awesome a character is, we end up yelling “we get it!”

On the other hand, and we would get to see them struggle and fight to get back their power (opening up all kinds of possibilities for the next season, or even this season depending on how many episodes are left).  

We would then also get to see where Rachel’s loyalty lies.  She has had her romantic conflicts with Mike, Rachel would be inclined to further strengthen her ties with him as well as Hardman. (And from here on I will assume that’s what Rachel will do.)

With Rachel on that side of the fence, as they are the one’s protecting his secret – and let’s be honest, Mike and Harvey are just too comical together to split up. Ever.  So, while Mike’s using his super genius powers for good to restore Harvey and Jessica to their rightful places, what happens next?  Oh yeah, that’s right, Rachel is on team Louis/Hardman, and we get to have some cute star-crossed lovers action happening.

Unfortunately for this scenario, unless as a first order of business under Hardman’s rule the super Harvey/Mike team use their legal prowess to have her reinstated.  Otherwise she could act as an outside character to the firm, meeting up with Harvey on occasion and helping him do some frowned upon legal tradings etc.

But the #1 reason why Louis should vote Hardman?  Because it makes sense!  Louis is actually another character I really like - I know, we know he is good at is his job, and he can do a lot of things that Harvey can’t do and that is shown in the flashback episode when Harvey has him look through the money to see who is stealing from the company.  Besides being good at his job, Harvey looks down on him because in this regard Harvey’s just being an egotistical ass, and Jessica does not give him the respect he deserves.  And for this reason, realistically, he will side with Hardman.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/suits/comments/y8tqr/who_will_louis_side_with_spoilers/

It started with the opening scene, culminating with you cutting Jessica off and calling showing ones feelings ""weak"".

But I want to know what happened! What messed you up that bad Harvey? For the first time we've seen Harvey's armor crack, clearly, I think that was you.

You saw your father give your mom all his love. And what did he get? A cheating wife who didn't love back. That's what he got for being vulnerable and really caring. Jackshit

But you're not going to make that mistake are you Harvey. From a young age, they haven't truly been meaningful and deep. So in this way you are a tragic hero. You got to let that armor down Harvey. And I can't wait to see the man behind it, when you do.

the main characters.(Harvey)",0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/suits/comments/k3wpe/as_asked_my_interpretation_and_characterization/,"Ok here we go. I just wanted to give my insights to the characters of Suits, my opinion on their deleopment, what I like what I dont like. Even if its just for the two people who asked me to do this, which is probably not a bad perspective to have.

[edit] I see this will take more time than I thought

**Harvey:**

*Actor* Gabriel Macht is spot on imo

*General:*
The pilot establishes him as the shark-type lawyer with a heart for certain kinds of people. It is implied that he is rather wealthy, I like that style) and has a leeway work attitude if its not something he is largely interested in.

*Character development*
As we go further into the series
What I like so far
Up until episode 11 he never really has a big thing which lets his Guard down, or because the real big thing has yet to happen remains to be seen. For my part this makes the character a bit 2 dimensional.

Don't get me wrong, the character has to drop out of certain predefined roles.

Where we come to another thing that irks me about him

*similarity to House*

Lets put the obivous ones
He is the same kind of amoral pain in the arse to get what he wants and what usually is the right thing to do, during a random conversation with mike/wilson about another topic.
The relationship Jessica/Harvey is the same kind of relationship Cuddy/house have. With the exception of me ever seeing harvey jessica being together.
Another thing is that his interest has to be sparked in order to get his genius working. See harvey and pro bono cases.

Tbh the series has to differ a bit more from that. On the top of my hat

*what I would like to see*

As written in the episode thread and seen above, and he is really pressured. I'd like him to acknoledge and ask for the help of mike, in a way that makes it obvious that the two of them as partners. While the series kinda established said fact, they both never acknowledged it to each other in a fashion. That seems to coming in the next episode.

I would like his special relationship with donna being played out more. However someone else said in another thread that more donna wouldn't necessarily better and that might be true. I'd like them to try it out anyways

Now, it's becoming a bit overplayed. 

I'm not saying there isn't any quick wit remaining, with regards to the cases - we've spent the entire season on one rather mundane case that has been droning on for far too long. 

There's also just been some really corny shit - for example when Katrina put that image on all the computers or last night with those little plaques the associates got. I understand this show isn't realistic in the slightest - but at least make the inner-firm attacks somewhat creative. These have seemed like they came out off of a junior high fan fiction blog. 

I suppose I'm just a fan of a different time in the series, but I just feel they have left some of the important ones that made the show so wildly successful out. The only reason I still watch is because I have an investment in these characters..I'm not sure if I were a new viewer if I would be as interested - many of the scenes in the last few episodes seem more like romantic drama at times.

&gt;One of the controversial deletions (Laughs) was a scene with Donna, I thought it slowed the episode down. I thought we had multiple endings. And the other reason was, it just felt in my gut not the show. But the writer of the episode was like, “These characters would do that. It’s organic.” She loved it. We talked it through, and I ultimately decided it was best not to have it in there. But it will be on the DVD, and I know that people will love to see it. In and of itself, it is a great scene.

-Shit goes real bad for Harvey

-Mike inevitably breaking down and admits his feeling to Rachel but this will take way longer to happen than we expect.

-Oh wait Rachel found someone!! or more likely she has to move after passing bar but I want more Rachel.

-Hardman exposed as a dick

-shit from his daughter

-Maybe Mike is assigned to be her guardian. maybe she gets infatuated with Mike

-Donna makes a move on Harvey way later on in the season. Awkward ensuing moment but Harvey has hooked up dramatically with his ex already. Heartbreak for Donna and all fans go aww because who can't love Donna.

-Relationship for Louis as well as joining another firm and becoming the enemy. Jessica actually expressing sorrow but then she becomes a massive baddass and some great exchanges of threats and insults occur.

-New characters - young juniour lawyer who become Mikes new buddy for hanging out

-New old guy thrown into the mix who is super wealthy and has huge sway in future of firm.

-Some new super rich partying for Mike in Entourage style. Could mix in cocaine here but no need

-new hot character to distract Mike and add character. Also they hook up quick and have good sex but shes not right for him

-Mikes Granny dies. Honestly they can't do much more with her story

-Huge legal complications within firm

-Some dating for Jessica. I'm apathetic towards it happening but it probably will.

-A couple of cliched case of the week episodes where Mike pulls something out his ass again and again.

-It ws mentioned earlier that you could have to send your previous graduates to Harvard to promote your law firm. This will be Mike ofcourse which will be shit tripping adventure. Brilliant Deux ex machina will occur and it will be so enjoyable watching him escape.

-Quick idea that Mikes next girl actually be from Harvard and she has to be rich and wealthy represent the seductive nature of well

-Eventually Mike has to be exposed I think but the truth is that he still passed the bar hasn't he? Therefore he can still continue working but shit will be dramatic.

-Mike does some insane good lawyering throughout season and everybody kinda goes ""This boy be schooling everyones ass""

-I hope we get less moral posturing but suits loves it. Would prefer Mike just to be a bad ass and not be constantly face with 2 shit options. I watch Suits for fun and I fell it doesn't do moral quandaries very well because they made Mike too likeable and they cannot be near as ruthless as HBO therefore it always feels a bit limp and censored.

So I agree with [1] [cjap2011's](http://www.reddit.com/r/suits/comments/wurhg/noooooooooooooo/c5gmw60) prediction that the whole situation is a ploy from Hardman. BUT it does several things as well.

* It opens up the cast for a new character.


Suits has great characters all throughout, possibly making them a permanent addition to the show.

* We get to explore Harvey and Donna as characters

They're both always right, which is great. And, because they're not working together, we get to explore the love interest.

* Bring back ""Mike and Rachel""

Because of the parallels between ""Harvey and Donna"" and ""Mike and Rachel, or at least the tension will build back up.

* Big season finale of a HUGE WIN

By taking down Hardman and Tanner when the fraud blows up in their faces.
