My roommate plays Six Samurai

His girlfriend and I decided to play a prank on him by buying 40 Kagemusha of the Blue Flame's. Then
Now, I knew I had to think fast. So I said ""how about we ban five cards from eachother's decks, make it a bit more interesting?"". He was a bit skeptical but couldn't resist the chance to remove Magics from my deck. So I put five Kagemusha's face down and he put five cards from mine face down. Then I power shuffled his deck and he shufffled mine. 




We drew 5 cards from eachother's decks and set them on the table. He won the rock paper scissors and drew one more. 





He picked up his six cards and I just saw his eyes widen. The look of confusion was hilarious right before the embarrassment sunk in. He ran into his room and slammed his door while I died of laughter. After about a minute he came out and looked through the deck

1369476947.0,1f0v7y,Side Deck Theory: 101,CheekyLittleCunt,140,25,40,"Hey /r/yugioh, but they still won't win. It's knowing how to side deck properly

As an example throughout this guide I will be using my Kagetokage Evilswarm deck and it's side; shown [here](http://i.imgur.com/eUjpIr3.png). 


**-Forward-**

If you notice a lot of the top decks in the current meta at the moment, or the ""perfect"" E-Dragon deck. These are the standard builds, and they're consistent and reliable. I cannot stress this enough; *there is nothing wrong with playing a standard build*. Just because someone else plays the same deck or thought of it before you, does not make you less creative or a worse player. Many people play these standard builds because after getting comfortable with them in testing, they find they like them much, much better than what they were playing previously. People who hate on players because ""huh huh, you're just playing a meta net deck you're just so desperate to win you're not a good player at all I built my Skull Servants from scratch and they are infinitely better than the re-used expensive garbage you're playing"" are a disease on the game. They are just as bad as the ""Oh you only started reading Game of Thrones after you watched the series

A deck is meta because it wins a lot. Sorry to break this to you guys, no one is stopping you; it is a game after all and you're there to have fun.

But please stop complaining about not winning because ""meta decks are too broken"". These are the decks that are the best at the moment and competitive players want to *win*

1. Pay a fuck ton of money and buy yourself a Meta deck **and learn to use it properly**

2. Come up with some crazy new tech or deck idea that wipes the floor with everything Meta at the moment.

The problem with number 2 is; it's already been tried. Once a crazy, but if your ShapesnatchChaosOjamaOTK was *really* that good, you'd be seeing deck profiles of Jeff Jones's version on TCGplayer around about now.

Original decks don't win

-**The Theory** -  

Alright now my rant is over and you've (hopefully) come down to earth and learned the true nature of this game; let's talk business. 

You know that ""standard"" deck I was talking about before? Everyone knows what it is, an extra sarc, LaDD, drop the hole etc. But this is what you come to expect. Thus you know what to side for it. Random rogue tech (like ""Obelisk the Tormentor"") might really throw you off. 


**Only side for the Meta.**

I can't stress this enough. There is no room in your side deck to waste against tier 2/3 decks that won't top. You want to be at the top tables throughout your whole tournament

* 9 Side Deck cards against Dragon Rulers
* 4 Side Deck cards against Prophecy ( 7 if you consider Veiler) and 3 Main deck.
* 7 Side Deck cards against Mermail
* 2 Side Deck cards against Mirror/Fire Fist (or 5 if you consider Veiler).

I haven't sided for Gadgets, Karakuri, Agent, Chaos Dragons or any other non Tier 1 deck. There is just no space, and my main deck should be able to deal with most of that anyway. 

""But what about ""Chain Burn"" and other troll decks... what am I supposed to do about them?"" I hear you say. Simple. You lose.

At every major tournament you're going to need X-2 to top. The chances of you coming across a rogue deck that ruins your day is slim, but it hurts theirs more, and might get you the win; they're also flexible enough that they work the same way against all rogue decks.

That won't matter anyway

**Does it hurt your strategy?**

There's no point siding in Macro Cosmos against ""Mermail"" if you're playing ""Infernity"". There's no point siding Gozen Match against E-Drags if you're playing Wind-Up. Think about your choices carefully.

Do the benefits outweigh the losses?

In my Evilswarm side I have 3 copies of ""Imperial Iron Wall"". With that card up it means I can't play Rescue Rabbit or Evilswarm Kerykion, it works wonders. E-drags can't summon anything except with the babies (and I'll have an Ophion out anyway, hopefully) and they can't use Breakthrough Skill to negate my Ophion. Prophecy won't be able to pop with HPOP or use Spellbook of Life and (my most hated card) Spellbook of Fate.

If a side deck card hurts your deck but completely shuts down your opponents deck; *it is worth siding*.

**Going first or second makes a BIG difference.**

I like the card ""Upstart Goblin"" because it helps speed up how fast I can get Ophion out

Let's say I just won Game 1 against E-dragons; First of all I will side out my EEV for ""Imperial Iron Wall"" and "" Dark Hole

I know I'm going second so I will side out my Upstarts for 3 copies of Maxx ""C"". That way

Let's say I lose that game and now I'm going first. My strategy *relies* on Getting out a First Turn Ophion and *stopping* their special summons. Thus

**What you side out is just as important as what you side in.**

A lot of people get excited about their crazy new original side deck choice and forget they actually need to take something out in order for it to work. Think about your deck and ask yourself what you can safely side out. For me it would be the EEV, but that might be outweighed by the benefits of the cards I'm siding in.

Remember, Fire Fist)). Side cards are *tech* choices against a specific deck first and foremost. Tech should never get in the way of your strategy.

 
**Use Flexible Sides**

I like Veiler and Maxx C as they can be sided against a lot of decks. If I get a Hieratic matchup

If you have a choice between a deck specific side (Soul drain, Thunder King, Summon Limit).  

**Consider Counter Siding.**

I've been arguing with myself a lot whether I should include MST in my side but I've decided against it because I just can't find the room. However

I decided against it because you need to remember the Meta Decks at the moment are all siding against each other.  Prophecy are siding heavily for the Mirror/Dragons and Dragons are siding heavily against Prophecy/Dragons. They all have small answers to Ophion in their side but they've dedicated more space to ""more important"" cards. The Prophecy player who flips Rivalry against me will have my utmost respect (and surrender). 

Think about your counter sides. Playing Dark World? You're likely to see Macro Cosmos/D-Fissure/Soul Drain against you in Game 2 and 3. You're going to need a lot of Backrow hate; MST/Twister/Dust Tornado/Malevolant Catastrophe etc.

**Iron out the details**

I had to choose between a second Compuls or a TT. I chose the TT because of Mermail but I'll probably be bouncing around between the two in testing. I'm also unsure whether I should be playing Prideful Roar or Forbidden Lance

Whenever I side in graveyard removal, but Macro Cosmos can be chained and doesn't take up your normal summon, and it can't be run over by higher attack monsters. They're both slightly better than D-Fissure though as they deal with XYZ Material and Fire Fist; but I've opted for D-fissure because it's a better option against a first turn set Mermail Abysslinde; and if I know they're playing Veiler or Maxx C, I can play it and then be safe in the knowledge my Rescue Rabbit is playable. 

At the end of the day you probably won't be 100% satisfied with your side deck but that's okay; no one ever is. You're always going to have that moment where you think ""Oh if only I'd sided -example- I could have won that duel""

Play what you're comfortable with and don't let other people, and you're only playing it because your friend topped your last regional with it, you're going to have a bad time. 

Anyway, it's a result of my hard work finding things out by myself and being taught by my friends who are great at the game.

Thanks a lot for reading.

**Breakdown of Damage Step** (PocketEngi)

My understanding is that the damage step and damage calculation are different. Damage calc is a substep of the damage step. Here's how it works:

*The Damage Step*

1. Begin the damage step

2. Flip up the attack target

3. Before damage calc

4. During damage calc

5. After damage calc 

6. Resolve leftover effects

7. Destroy a monster if applicable

8. End the damage step 

---

**Effects During Phases** (Argor42)

Effects that trigger by phase (such as Gladiator Beast monsters, etc.) do not follow standard SEGOC rules. Instead, they activate and resolve on separate chains. The order these effects can activate depends on who the turn player is, and how priority to activate effects is conducted between the two. 

The order of priority goes:

Turn Player's Mandatory Effects

Opponent's Mandatory Effects

Turn Player's Optional Effects

Opponent's Optional Effects

Priority between players can be passed from one to another

Example 1: Let's say Player A has conducted battle with Gladiator Beast Retiari, and all have survived battle, allowing them to activate their effects at the end of the Battle Phase. Player A is allowed to choose the order in which these effects activate and resolve. So Player A can activate Retiari's effect first to return itself to the Deck and summon a Gladiator Beast monster (if that monster has an effect that triggers when summoned, that effect can activate at that time, before the effects of the other Gladiator Beasts to tag out activate), then after that sequence of events, activate Bestiari's effect to tag out and summon another Gladiator Beast monster, so it can go Retiari, Bestiari...and so on.

Example 2: Let's say Player A has activated Mind Control to take control of Player B's Wind-Up Zenmaines. During Player A's Main Phase 2, Player A has priority to activate/resolve one of these. However, Player A can pass priority to Player B to activate/resolve mandatory effects (in this case, Effect Veiler wearing off). If Player B does resolve Effect Veiler in this case, then Player A regains priority to activate/resolve mandatory effects, and can choose to resolve Zenmaines before Mind Control, or Mind Control before Zenmaines. If Player B does not resolve Effect Veiler in this case, and must at this point choose to resolve either Zenmaines or Mind Control. This is because the effects are mandatory

Example 3: It is Player A's Standby Phase, tributing Treeborn Frog to take control of one of Player B's monsters. Since multiple chains can form in the Standby Phase, and since Treeborn Frog has no restriction on how many times it can be used per turn, Treeborn Frog is allowed to reactivate its effect, summoning itself to the Field after Enemy Controller has resolved.

---

**Missing the Timing**

4 types of effect wording


Phrasing is the thing to look for.

1) ""If X happens; do Y""

2) ""If X happens; you can do Y""

3) ""When X happens; do Y""

None of these can miss the timing. These three effects start a new chain when the current chain resolves.

1 and 3 mean the same thing but may be written differently on different cards. 
They are both mandatory effects and will be the first links in the new chain

The last kind is the type of effect that misses the timing:

4) ""When X happens; you can do Y""

What this says is ""If and only if X is the very last thing to happen

In 4

Remember that only the activation of an optional effect can miss the timing.

---

**Effect Priority**

First of all

Before the 25th of April 2012, JD, Chaos Sorcerer, etc.), you get to activate that monster's effect as Chain Link 1 before the opponent is allowed to activate a card like BTH or Torrential Tribute.

Now

This does NOT apply to Quick Effects or Trigger Effects. If you summon a monster with a Trigger Effect that activates upon summoning

If you summon a monster with a Quick Effect (the kind that says ""once per turn
So this other priority is the ability

---

**SEGOC**

This stands for “Simultaneous Effects Go On Chain”

The order in which these simultaneous effects activate depends on 2 things: whose turn it is

1. Turn Player's Mandatory Effects

2. Non-Turn Player's Mandatory Effects

3. Turn Player's Optional Effects

4. Non-Turn Player's Optional Effects

If a player controls 2 cards of the same category and they activate at the same time

E.g. Turn player activates Card Destruction with a Snoww and a Broww in his hand. Both are mandatory effects. He chooses to activate Snoww first.

CL1: Snoww

CL2: Broww

CL2 Resolves: He draws a card

CL1 Resolves: He searches out a card.

In the TCG only

E.g. Player tributes Sangan to summon Zaborg, his effect is CL1 and Zaborg’s is CL2.

---

**Decking Out and Exodia**

Decking Out in the middle of a Chain Link

Example:

P1 activates Heavy Storm.

P2 chains Reckless Greed with 1 card in his deck.

Reckless Greed resolves and he draws the last needed piece of Exodia.

The chain ends there
has no cards left. Even though he has all 5 pieces
obliterate because the game state is in the middle of a card effect. P2 loses.

Example 2:

P1 activates Heavy Storm.

P2 chains Reckless Greed with 2 cards in his deck.

Reckless Greed resolves and he draws the last needed piece of Exodia

The chain ends there, P2 has fulfilled a win condition and wins.

---

**Summon Negation and Response**

These are two different things that occur at different times. Certain cards can be activated in each

In the Summon Negation Window

The only cards that can be activated at this time are cards which specifically say they negate the summon of a monster, Solemn Judgment, Steelswarm Roach, and Evolzzar Laggia. 

If no one wishes to activate anything in the Summon Negation Window, and the Summon Response Window is opened.

If the monster’s summon triggers its effect, such as Bottomless Trap Hole, Torrential Tribute, and Compulsory Evacuation Device. 

* Note that for a card to activate first in the Summon Negation Window must have an effect that negates the monster’s summon. After this

E.g. Player A Special Summons Black Luster Soldier while Royal Oppression is face-up.

Player B activates the effect of Royal Oppression

Player A activates MST

MST destroys Royal Oppression

* However

E.g. Player A summons Thunder King Rai-Oh. No one negates

Player B activates Compulsory Evacuation Device

CED resolves and TKRO is returned to the hand.

---

**Miscellaneous**

* Cards in a chain don’t go to the graveyard until the entire chain resolves

* Honest vs. Honest. If Player A attacks Player B

E.g. Player A's Thunder King Rai-Oh attacks Player B's Black Luster Soldier Envoy

CL1 Honest drops on TKRO

CL2 Honest drops on BLS

Resolves

CL2 BLS gains the attack of Rai-Oh

CL1 Rai-Oh gains the new attack of BLS

For any of these damage-step ATK change thingies

http://duelistgroundz.com/index.php?showtopic=155209

See the second round writeup.

I don't even know how this could happen. The victim is on the plane on his way home now

He just posted on facebook:

""OK here's the sleeve situation that got me a game loss round 2 and thus costed me an early match. This is 100% factual

In the morning before the event we had a player meeting in the player's room where we would sleeve our decks and hand them to the judges who keep them until we begin round 1. They handed us each two packs of their shitty zexal picture sleeves which only have 50 sleeves per pack even though the game they are made for requires 55 at the bare minimum (70 technically).

I sleeved my entire deck face down because there were other players at the table

Round 2, the HJ asked me to come with him backstage. When I got there, he interrogated me with a bunch of questions like what deck was I playing etc until he finally pulled out some cards and asked if they were the cards I sided. They were. Apparently one of the judges had noticed some slightly different sleeve edges in my deck and managed to pull out my side cards. Based on my entirely truthful answers to his questions, he deemed it wasn't intentional, but because there was a pattern, even if unintentional, the penalty is a game loss. If he had deemed it intentional

I tried as hard as I could to reason with him until he told me if I kept going I would get more penalties.

1363302585.0,1abdh1,"Coming Soon: YuGiOh! PlayBook! - A database for decks, decktypes, and most importantly, plays.",n4ru,15

A little while ago I had an idea - every time I started to play a new deck, and most of all, I had to find the plays or discover them myself by slowly using the deck on DN (and annoying my opponents in the process with slow play). There was no place to discover entire decks with all their techs and plays. I decided it was time to end that. Last night I started working on YuGiOh! Playbook! 

YuGiOh! Playbook! is a site that aims to help people jump right into new decks by quickly allowing players to find deck cores, based on decktypes, cost, popularity, and other criteria. 

Perhaps you want to find a Mermail deck to run? Undine variant? Mono variant? Atlantean variant? Each page will give quick access to similar decks that run the same cores.

The site aims to eventually allow you to search ""vintage"" decks that were once legal in advanced play. Initially

While the information and main pages are complete, but I'm looking for the following:

* Heavy Contributors - Players that know specific deck cores and their most crucial plays
* Images - I need to find an image of every card neatly named by some manner for easy access. I'll possibly be trying to rip them from Wikia later for use on my site.
* Funds - Sites aren't free
* Suggestions - Any suggestions to improve the site are appreciated. Currently the site aims to be minimal but informative
* Layout Design - The current layout is simple and nice in my opinion

That seems to be all for now folks

**EDIT:** Spent a lot of time on the content page. Here's a short example of the layout of the deck pages: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17275510/sample.png

**EDIT #2:** Database should be setup pretty soon. Content should be starting to roll in tomorrow night and then site should be in Alpha

**EDIT #3:** YGO Playbook! will be open to deck and play submissions later this week. Remember

**EDIT #4:** No sleep for me! On the last leg of the site before I can start adding content and cleaning up code.

**EDIT #5:** Contacted a few of you that showed interest in layout design. Going to pass out soon and probably get the content rolling tomorrow.",self,t5_2rpe6,1363632203.0,,blank,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1abdh1/coming_soon_yugioh_playbook_a_database_for_decks/

If you know something is coming up that is going to restrict you from sending out, DO NOT MAKE A COMMITMENT TO SOMETHING THAT WILL MAKE SOMEONE WAIT.

Obviously emergencies we can't plan for, get a stamp from the machine at the post office, and stick it in your mail box, then you shouldn't be having time to be playing during that time anyways.

Sorry for being so blunt, I will go out of my way even if it means an extra 10 minutes of waiting in a jam packed line at the post office to make sure the person I am dealing with gets the best service possible. Trading with people is business, and everyone should be treating everyone with common courtesy of fulfilling their commitment. I hope i'm not the only one around here that feels this way.

From stores: Your unopened boxes in those glass cases are not safe unless you lock the case before and after opening. I sat at the end of the case with my back to it

From store binders: You let me see the store binder, and when your attention breaks in one quick motion you pull the card the rest of the way and drop it on the floor in front of you. If someone walks by, ""oh sorry you dropped this"" ""thanks guy."" If not, you found a card and keep it to yourself.

From other peoples binders: Same thing, or the ground, or even just palming it and handing it off to a friend. Working in teams was way more effective. Scaringly effective. One guy ""hey I like that BLS, heres my binder"" I'm going to ask to see what you've got while you work out a deal with him, search his binder, and when you're done you lost one of your cards.

If you're playing in a large tourney, you'll lose something out of it. Binders in general can be reached into and the top 3 cards of the binder are all susceptable.

Don't let more than 1 person look at anything you have. That is just bad business. If you keep cards in a deckbox

Dueling: Keep your GY behind your deck. This puts loose cards closer to you

Cameras don't work. They do work in rare events but just don't get cameras and say the problem is fixed. Your judges need to be the number 1 protector against theft. Even them watching a trade happening is enough deterrent

Snatch and grabs happen. And it is so, these bags even have locks. 

Big box stores: Wallyworld/target: Blister packs are a razor blade away from being in my pocket. The bike section is where I would go to with a hand cart with some paper towels, I'll open the box and put the packs in my jacket. Didn't see to many unopend boxes, the packs were sitting there easy enough. 

tl;dr: Ex-thief teaching you how to keep your shit safe. I didn't stick around long enough to see what happened, make sure they don't keep there hand as a placeholder, keep 1 thing at a time out of your pack.",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1e74v2/i_have_played_since_sdy_i_have_stolen_lots_of/

Ghostricks cannot be attacked while facedown with Ghostrick house on the field

Toons could attack directly if the opponent did not control any face-up Toon monsters with Toon World out.

Ghostricks can attack directly with Ghostrick House out of all your opponent's monsters are facedown

*Edit- You cannot attack with a Toon the turn it is summoned (balance issues for direct attacking).

Ghostricks cannot be normal summoned unless you control another one

This is just a start of what I had in mind
  
Just in case this does get support, possibly Amanda LePalme (Dragonduelistgirl), for the yugitubers and ask them questions (which would be what all of you want asked, or get them to do AMA's). As for pro players, which may be harder to do, contact people like Billy Brake, Jeff Jones, Tyer Tabman, this is just a vague idea off the top of my head.

This particular guide is the most detailed I've ever made and has taken over an hour and a half to make. Please upvote this if it has helped you at all. I'd like for as many people as possible to see this


Hi y'all

Being for real now, the Master](http://www.reddit.com/user/PhilyTheMaster/), and I love rogue decks. But I don't love playing them, I love WINNING with them. A lot of people on the subreddit know me for my Watts, and a few know me for Chaos Agents before that, but this was my favorite project. 

Gusto's have been known to be slow

What I ended up was a consistent field like:

* [this](http://imgur.com/IkG4T1Y)

* [or this](http://imgur.com/4oHx8u5)

* [and on more than one occasion

How? Well

**Tempest-Gusto Guide** 

**1.0 The Monsters**

*1.1 The Gustos*

**Note** In this variant we are going to use a watered down version of the recruiter loop

* *Gusto Gulldos*: Level 3 TUNER

&gt; When this card is sent from the field to the Graveyard: You can Special Summon 1 Level 2 or lower ""Gusto"" monster from your Deck.

He is the main, and he searches out Gusto Egul.

* *Gusto Egul*: Level 1 TUNER

&gt; When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard: You can Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower non-Tuner ""Gusto"" monster from your Deck.

The second in command, but normally will be used to search out Caam in this build

* *Winda

&gt; When this card is destroyed by battle with an opponent's attacking monster and sent to your Graveyard: You can Special Summon 1 ""Gusto"" Tuner monster from your Deck.

The crappiest of the recruiters, but would trigger Eguls. I personally only run 1, and that is only if my opponent is about to get off 3+ attacks in a row. She also restarts the loop, if you're into that.

* *Caam

&gt; Once per turn: You can shuffle 2 ""Gusto"" monsters from your Graveyard into the Main Deck; draw 1 card.

Crucial as crucial can be. Recycles the recruiters, never. 

* Gusto Griffen: Level 2

&gt; If this card is sent from the hand to the Graveyard: You can Special Summon 1 ""Gusto"" monster from your Deck. You can only use the effect of ""Gusto Griffin"" once per turn.

Released in HA07, and he combos like no other. Single handedly will make a dead hand unbelievably live. I'll pitch him with Tempest to grab a Debris Dragon/Lightning, and start off my recruiter loop, or SS the right level tuner to go into whatever Synchro I want. Way too good. Seriously, MVP. Oh, and he **DOESN'T MISS TIMING**. He will always be able to SS

*1.1.1* Tech Gustos.

Here is where things get very interesting. Griffen makes literally every Gusto an option. If you want to be creative

*1.2 Tempest Core*

* Tempest

&gt; If this card is in your hand or Graveyard: You can banish a total of 2 WIND and/or Dragon-Type monsters from your hand and/or Graveyard, Dragon Ruler of Storms"" effect per turn, and only once that turn.

I will never never discard this card unless I absolutely have too, which sets up combos for days.

* Lightning

&gt; You can discard this card AND 1 Dragon-Type or WIND monster; Special Summon 1 ""Tempest

Combo with Griffen is one of the best plays this deck can do. Easy way to set up a double Tempest turn

*1.3 Other Important WIND monsters*

*  Shield Wing: Level 2

&gt; Up to twice per turn

Amazing with this deck. Helps you survive a turn, search out a Debris Dragon. Summon Debris Dragon, Debris Summons Shield Wing, Synchro 6 into Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg. The combo keeps going from there, but I will explain in a bit.

* Debris Dragon: Level 4 TUNER 1000/2000 **RUN 2**

&gt; When this card is Normal Summoned: You can target 1 monster with 500 or less ATK in your Graveyard; Special Summon that target in face-up Attack Position. Its effects are negated. This card cannot be used as a Synchro Material Monster

Combos with Shield Wing as described above

*1.4 Time to Tech it Up*

* Effect Veiler: Level 1 TUNER 0/0 **RUN 0-3**

&gt; During your opponent's Main Phase: You can send this card from your hand to the Graveyard to target 1 face-up Effect monster your opponent controls; negate that target's effects until the End Phase.

This card is amazing

* Maxx ""C"": Level 2 500/500 **RUN 0-3**

&gt; During either player's turn: You can send this card from your hand to the Graveyard; this turn

In this swarming Meta, summoned Debris Dragon, SS Maxx C and synchro'd into Iron Chain Dragon.

* Gorz the Emissary of Darkness: Level 7

&gt; When you take damage from a card your opponent controls: You can Special Summon this card from your hand. You must control no cards to activate and to resolve this effect. When Special Summoned this way

&gt; ● Battle Damage: Special Summon 1 ""Emissary of Darkness Token"" (Fairy-Type/LIGHT/Level 7/ATK ?/DEF ?). Its ATK and DEF are each equal to the amount of Battle Damage you took.

&gt; ● Effect Damage: Inflict damage to your opponent equal to the amount of damage you took.

Easy summonable Level 7

* Tragoedia: Level 10

&gt; When you take Battle Damage: You can Special Summon this card from your hand. This card gains 600 ATK and DEF for each card in your hand. Once per turn: You can send 1 monster from your hand to the Graveyard to target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls with the same Level as the sent monster; take control of that target. Once per turn: You can target 1 monster in your Graveyard; this card's Level becomes the same as that target's

Combos well because his ability to change his level to whatever you need (provided it is in the graveyard). Plus discarding griffen lets you steal something that level and gets the SS from griffen!

* Droll and Lock Bird: Level 1

&gt; If your opponent adds a card(s) from their Deck to their hand, neither player can add card(s) from their Deck to their hand. (Drawing cards is also considered as ""adding a card to the hand."")

Good against the meta

-------

**2.0 The Spells**

This deck is slightly reliant on a few spells

*2.1 The Staples*

* Monster Reborn **RUN 1**

&gt; Target 1 monster in either player's Graveyard; Special Summon it.

No explanation needed. This is Yugioh

* Heavy Storm **RUN 1**

&gt; Destroy all Spell and Trap Cards on the field.

Backrow is known as the only thing strong enough to stop Viagra from working. It kills the aggro circlejerk. It's better to be safe and draw it against FrogMonarchs game one than to be stupid and get raped by Verz because you didn't run it.

* Dark Hole **RUN 1**

&gt; Destroy all monsters on the field.

People say not to run it this Meta because a lot of decks have anti-destruction effects. Those people are idiots. You run this card. Always. Don't be a scrub.

* Mystical Space Typhoon **RUN 2-3**

&gt; Target 1 Spell/Trap Card on the field; destroy that target.

Remember, but less effective.

*2.2 Gimme you're monster Spell cards*

* Mind Control **RUN 1**

&gt; Target 1 monster your opponent controls; until the End Phase

Good to use their monster as Synchro or XYZ bait. Good to clear a pesky monster. Good in general. Run it. Fools.

* Creature Swap: **RUN 1-3**

&gt; Each player chooses 1 monster they control and switches control of those monsters with each other. Those monsters cannot change their battle positions for the rest of this turn.

Combos with Egul amazingly, SO THAT MONSTER CAN ATTACK TOO**. Doesn't work with Winda, cause she's a slut.

*2.3 Consistency Spell Cards*

* Gold Sarcophagus **RUN 2-3**

&gt; Banish 1 card from your Deck

Banish Tempest to search out Debris or Lightning. Sometimes you might want to Banish a different card to ensure getting it. I don't know

* Pot of Avarice **RUN 1**

&gt; Target 5 monsters in your Graveyard; shuffle all 5 into the Deck

You will literally be pumping more monsters into your graveyard than a mill deck. By the end of turn 3, will be in your graveyard 80% of the time, 100% of the time. This helps a lot, plus them plusses.

*2.4 Spells I don't like

* Contract with Gusto: **RUN 0-3

&gt; Target 2 ""Gusto"" monsters in your Graveyard and 1 card your opponent controls; shuffle both targets in your Graveyard to the Deck

It's good

* Emergency Teleport **RUN 0-0**

&gt; Special Summon 1 Level 3 or lower Psychic-Type monster from your hand or Deck. During the End Phase this turn

More importantly than anything I'm about to say about this card

---

**3.0 The Traps**

*3.1 Literally any trap you want*

This deck has a ton of versatility, it doesn't seem too worth it. Threatening Roar is my favorite trap, but cockblocks the point of the Gusto recruiter loop. So, fuck that noise.

Some Suggestions:

* Bottomless Trap Hole

&gt; When your opponent Summons a monster(s) with 1500 or more ATK: Destroy that monster(s) with 1500 or more ATK

* Compulsory Evacuation Device

&gt; Target 1 monster on the field; return that target to the hand.

* Breakthrough Skill

&gt; Target 1 face-up Effect Monster your opponent controls; negate the effects of that opponent's face-up monster

* Solemn Warning 

&gt; When a monster would be Summoned, or monster effect is activated that includes an effect that Special Summons a monster(s): Pay 2000 Life Points; negate the Summon or activation, and if you do, destroy that card.

* Fiendish Chain

&gt; Target 1 face-up Effect Monster on the field; that target's effects are negated

*3.2 Traps not to run*

* Any trap with the word Gusto in it.

---

**4.0 The extra deck**

*4.1 The Synchros*

This deck has a ton of bookkeeping to do when synchroing. Debris can only Synchro dragons

*4.1.1 Level 4 Synchros*

* Armory Arm: 1800/1200 **RUN 1**

&gt; **1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters** Once per turn, that target gains 1000 ATK. When that target destroys a monster by battle and sends it to the Graveyard: Inflict damage to your opponent equal to the ATK of the destroyed monster in the Graveyard.

Good way to make a crazy strong beater with Mecha Phantom Beast Draccosack by using a token and Egul or Effect Veiler.

*4.1.2 Level 5 Synchros*

* Ally of Justice Catastor: 2200/1200 **RUN 1**

&gt; **1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters** At the start of the Damage Step

The best level 5 synchro

* T.G. Hyper Librarian: 2400/1800 **RUN 0-1**

&gt; **1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters** When a monster is Synchro Summoned: Draw 1 card. This card must be face-up on the field to activate and resolve this effect.

The deck synchros a lot. If you can get him out early

* Daigusto Gulldos: 2200/800 **RUN 0-1**

&gt; **1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner ""Gusto"" monsters**
Once per turn: You can shuffle 2 ""Gusto"" monsters from your Graveyard into the Main Deck to target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; destroy that target.

This is the **ONLY DAIGUSTO SYNCHRO I RUN**. Sorry, sort of. I normally don't go into him, unless I have nothing better to do.

*4.1.3 Level 6 Synchro monsters*

* Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg: 2400/800 **RUN 1**

&gt; **1 Dragon-Type Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner Winged Beast-Type monsters** Once per turn

He is so fucking good. For reals. You can search out a Griffen, but I have literally never ever summoned Griffen). A good combo, if you have Lightning and another Winged-Beast type in your hand is to search out Gusto Griffen, pitch the Winged-Beast, then pitch Lightning (special summoning a Tempest) and Griffen (special summoning a Gusto). Seriously too good of a card. Once he gets destroyed, he is a dragon and a wind, you can banish him for Tempest! He is too hard to make to warrant running 2 of

* Iron Chain Dragon: 2500/1300 **RUN 1**

&gt; **1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters** You can remove from play all ""Iron Chain"" monsters from your Graveyard to have this card gain 200 ATK for each card removed

The best generic level 6

*4.1.4 Level 7 Synchros*

* Black Rose Dragon: 2400/1800 **RUN 2**

&gt; **1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters** When this card is Synchro Summoned, and reduce its ATK to 0 until the End Phase.

The best synchro in this deck. Only because he is the only good level 7 synchro. His destruction effect is great, I use him and Tempest to XYZ into Big Eye or Draccosack all the time. I will make both Black Rose Dragons in 2 turns, cause it so easy in this deck. Debris Dragon and Lightning (which is a Debris Dragon target!), or Gulldos and Caam. It's too easy. Also a Dragon for Tempest!

*4.1.5 Level 8 Synchros*

* Stardust Dragon: 2500/2000 **RUN 1**

&gt; **1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters** When a Spell, or Effect Monster's effect is activated that destroys a card(s) on the field: You can Tribute this card; negate the activation and destroy it. During the End Phase, if this card negated an effect this way during this turn: You can Special Summon this card from your Graveyard.

Best generic level 8 Synchro monster since forever. Just good to have

* Crimson Bladder: 2800/2600 **RUN 1**

&gt; **1 Tuner + 1 or more Non-Tuner monsters** If this card destroys an opponent's monster by battle and sends it to the Graveyard: Your opponent cannot Normal or Special Summon Level 5 or higher monsters during their next turn.

*4.1.6 Level 9 Synchros*

* Mist Wurm: 2500/1500 **RUN 0-1**

&gt; **1 Tuner + 2 or more non-Tuner monsters** When this card is Synchro Summoned

Sometimes you can make him and he is a gamesaver/winner. Sometimes you can't and he is just dead weight. Depends on how you want to play this deck.

*4.2 The XYZ*

*4.2.1 Rank 3 XYZ*

* Leviair The Sea Dragon: 1800/1600 **RUN 0-1**

&gt; **2 Level 3 monsters** Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card to target 1 banished Level 4 or lower monster; Special Summon that target to your side of the field.

I have literally never made this monster

*4.2.2 Rank 4 XYZ*

* Daigusto Emeral: 1800/800 **RUN 1**

&gt; **2 Level 4 monsters** Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card

Too good

* Lightning Chidori: 1900/1600 **RUN 1**

&gt; 2 Level 4 WIND monsters
When this card is Xyz Summoned: Target 1 Set card your opponent controls; return that target to the bottom of the Deck. Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card to target 1 face-up card your opponent controls; return that target to the top of the Deck.

This card is pretty amazing. Doesn't destroy

*4.2.3 Rank 7 XYZ*

* Number 11: Big Eye: 2600/2000 **RUN 1-2**

&gt; **2 Level 7 monsters** Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card to target 1 monster your opponent controls; take control of that target. This card cannot attack the turn you activate this effect.

Too good. Seriously

* Mecha Phantom Beast Draccosack: 2600/2200 **RUN 1-2**

&gt; **2 Level 7 monsters** Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card; Special Summon 2 ""Mecha Phantom Beast Tokens"" (Machine-Type/WIND/Level 3/ATK 0/DEF 0). While you control a Token

This is the best card in the meta right now

**5.0 How this deck runs**

This is a very combo based deck, and the next move you makes will shut all but 1-2 of those doors. You have to have good vision. This deck takes time to learn and way to long to master. I think I'm pretty good at it and I mess up all the time. Practice and practice.

There is the added benefit of being able to sit and wait. The Gustos will set up a very good barrier while the right pieces fall into your hand. You plus a gigaton and draw so much in this deck

I love this deck so very much.

1.  When you are you attempting to get around an opponent's monster with a spell such as smashing ground, etc. It is generally the case that you should summon and then use the spell as to avoid torrential, warning, and in some cases, bottomless trap hole. If you soul taker and then summon you've put yourself in a bad situation should they have any such traps.

2. When setting traps, and warning, there's no reason for you to set the dimensional prison.  Set the bottomless, the warning, or both, and if they get around them and have a monster next turn you can set the prison and take care of it.  If you, for instance, your bottomless is

3. Be smart with your MST.  Use it when you need it.  If your opponent has two face-downs and you are merely going to set this turn, you're now either going to have the MST when you need it or plus when they use their MST.  If your opponent has two face-downs and you have an MST and, say, a Thunder King and no other monsters, just be considerate of your deck and the rest of your cards in hand.  I would personally avoid the blind MST and summon the Thunder King or set the MST along with a defensive trap until the game state has been simplified or I draw more monsters should my opponent have a warning, bottomless, etc.

4. When building a side deck : Always know what you are going to be siding out when you decide to put cards in your side deck.  If you are siding heavy for Dark World and Mermail and you side 3 Soul Drain, that's fine.  But when you get to game two and realize you only have 6 cards you can afford to side out, you now have 3 dead cards in your side deck.

1368650034.0,1eelzg,Official Ruling by Konami on Evilswarm Castor,Lime_Time,81,14,86," Important News Regarding Evilswarm Castor and Constellar Pollux

May 15th

This past weekend, new questions and new situations arose, and as always, our incredible volunteer Judges rose to the challenge and performed admirably.

As is the case in any game or sport where officiating exists, we welcome such disagreements as they promote discussion and help us understand the different ways our players and judges view the game, the cards, the card text, and the rules in general.

All information gathered is carefully examined and processed so that we can improve the way our cards are written and create the best gameplay experience possible for all Duelists. It normally takes a while before you see any changes based on such information

The core disagreement this past weekend was on the mechanics of Evilswarm Castor and Constellar Pollux

During the turn this card was Normal Summoned

As you can see, who says this:

During the turn this card is Normal Summoned

Identical, and follow all the same rules as Dverg of the Nordic Alfar, as posted on the official website. That meant that you could negate the effect with Effect Veiler or Skill Drain, and if Dverg/Castor/Pollux aren’t on the field, you can’t use the extra Summon. This was obviously the correct ruling to make, considering the identical text of the cards, knowledge of Problem-Solving Card Text

Players disagreed. Most strongly in fact. In the past 72 hours, that once it’s Normal Summoned successfully, unless Skill Drain was already face-up on the field when it was Summoned, your opponent can’t play Counter Traps for the rest of the turn, no matter what they do to Dodger Dragon. Dodger Dragon says:

“Your opponent cannot activate Counter Trap Cards the turn this card is Normal Summoned.“

Aside from the order in which the phrases are placed, and Pollux. But it has rulings that say it works completely differently than those cards. What we end up with is a situation where the judges were right, but the players have a valid and very pressing point. It’s everything that we wanted to avoid when we introduced Problem-Solving Card Text.

So we’re going to clear this up once and for all. They’re rather unique effects, Constellar Pollux, Evilswarm Castor, Dodger Dragon, and Blizzard Princess. And the way they are meant to work is this:

-If you Normal Summon them successfully, regardless of what happens to the monster.

Because of the unique nature of these cards, but that they are not a Continuous effect like Atlantean Heavy Infantry that can be negated at any time. We do welcome suggestions on what each of you, personally, think would be the best way to word such effects. You can send your thoughts on that to us-ygorules@konami.com. Regardless, if you’re getting ready for your National Championships or other major events this weekend, keep in mind that all of these cards will now be ruled the same way, as stated above.

One more thing before I go, it’s just a Continuous Effect that is only active for one turn – the turn it’s Normal Summoned. To indicate that it works this way, we actually used a holdover from the old way that Continuous Effects were written, to make absolutely sure that it’s read and interpreted correctly. Here’s its text from its upcoming Number Hunters re-release:

During the turn this card was Normal Summoned

That’s the same “while this card is face-up on the field” we used back in Extreme Victory to let you know that Karakuri Komachi mdl 224 “Ninishi” was a Continuous Effect that can be negated.

And so the strange tale of Castor, and Dodger comes to an end. A big thank you to our judges at the YCS for a job well done, and another big thank you to all our players for your continued passion and love for the game. I hope you all enjoy your events this weekend, and remember: it’s always time to Duel!

Looking through OCG tournament results of late has rekindled my deep

1 Evilswarms

8 Degenerate dragons

2 Prophecy

1 Prophecy

8 Degenerate dragons

you get the picture. Honestly, TeleDaD did this too, but everyone ran that. The unbelievable overrepresentation of this deck in the top rankings is just sickening.

That's not all: When you take into account that they have broken archetypes that we in the TCG haven't even glimpsed at yet, and the deck isn't even slowed down, you've just gotta look at Konami. How delusional are they? How are they letting this happen? How are they releasing articles about Dragossack without mentioning E-Drags at all? Protip guys: If you make an archetypes boss monster available with any two level 7's, you better make damn sure that you didn't JUST RELEASE A SET OF CARDS IN THE SAME SET that make the monster ten times more effectively and consistently. Why do beastcrafts even exist? In their dragossack article they talk about ways to summon the damn thing - their optimal method requires 3 specific cards and sitting through an opponents turn with a face up trap and some nothing monsters while they supposedly do nothing. 

To put into perspective how broken this deck is - think about how expensive prophecy is, it forgoes Tragoedia for christ's sake. 

Coming from a guy who could actually build this deck if I wanted to - I say screw you Konami and screw you degenerate dragons. I'll be maining my Debunks and mind drains until September hopefully puts a stopper on this shitstorm. I'll lose,,False,self,t5_2rpe6,False,,True

**Engines**

The first deck concept that is important to look at is one that often is also the most difficult to build around. That is the Engine. Now what exactly is an engine? Engines are the driving factor of the deck. They provide the means of creating a desired output. Some engines are extremely compact while others can take the entire deck to really function properly and consistently. Sometimes engines are referred to as Deck Cores

Now from here I want to talk about three main points in regards to engines. The first is simply resources. What is a resource in a given deck? Well
*Why?* Well, the field is also where our ability to attack, trigger certain core effects or true resource denial begins. I'll cover this later. Now, there's three other resource sources that I want to cover with you. These are, the banished zone, deck, extra deck and hand. Of these, and the cards in it

That's a brief overview of the resource sources in the game of Yugioh. Now I want to talk about their consumption. Different decks will inevitably interact with their resources differently. Rather than going into excruciating detail about this process I want to instead focus on the details involved with actually consumption. Most decks require more resources be used to perform an action than you would necessarily gain from that action. That said
When a deck consumes a resource most of the time it's one and done. It's very difficult to regularly reuse a spent resource which is part of the reason why certain decks must set their graveyards heavily before starting a major play. Once the process begins it will burn fuel so quickly that once it's spent the match either must be won

Now what does this have to do with deck building? Well, it shaped the meta for a long time. To a limited degree, depending on where you're looking it still shapes the meta now. Interruption of a deck or engine is one of the quickest ways to insure victory. Waiting for your opponent to try for a key play and interrupting it by destroying, bouncing or neutralizing the core card for the play is pretty huge. Equally as powerful is simply preventing searches, limiting draw power or a number of other options. So much so that it actually has it's own deck type based on this principle.

---
**Deck types

A deck type is really a meta classification of a deck. There are three deck types. These form a triangle of sorts  and I will explain that in a minute. 

The first major deck type is an aggro deck. Much like it sounds, some decks, the OTK is the first and only thing they really care about. They focus so heavily on putting overwhelming firepower on the board that that's all that matters to the deck itself. 

Next on the list is Stun. Stun decks are pretty much the exact opposite of Aggro. An aggro deck want's to run you over. A Stun deck wants to make you burn and waste resources until there's nothing left while slowly whittling you down. Shortly after you've consumed all your resources it'll turn around and kick you in the teeth.

The last deck type in Yugioh is a Combo deck. Combo decks are pretty simple in conception. They want to create a loop of some sort that will inevitably deny your opponent resources or win the game. Sounds simple right? Well

Now, it seldom works out as cleanly or clearly as being pure meddles either.  So why bring it up? Well, to give you an idea of what you're building versus what is being built. If you're going to design a deck you have to take into consideration not only what you're playing but what you might interact with. A robust design versus a weak design require different approaches and different support structures in the deck itself.

---
**Deck Internal Synergy**

Now I've talk a lot about broad topics in the idea of deck design. Now I want to talk about why your harpie-machima-vanilla-knight deck isn't working. 

In this section I want to talk about consistency, card choice and card count matter. Now in this section what I want to tell you about is simple. How to improve your consistency. Most decks in Yugioh have an end goal. They want to do something on the field. Whether that means flooding it with monsters, or drawing exodia, they still need certain options or characteristics to actually make it happen. So how do I make sure that I have those options?

Propagation of a particularly poor packaging practice has prompted me to pen this passionate picture essay.

It is important to size your container to match your package. Any leftover space must be filled. This applies to packages large and small, you may end up with something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/niIuDw7.jpg).

Sleeves and a toploader provide basically all the protection cards need. **In most cases they are only vulnerable to damage or being lost if the envelope tears.** Since the toploader provides rigidity, right bad.](http://i.imgur.com/K1WUggO.jpg)

We're not safe yet! There's another bad habit. Tightly wrapping the toploader in a [shell of paper](http://i.imgur.com/rZ5PZra.jpg) only increases the chance of tearing. We don't need paper to protect the cards

Last but not least

Please take care to package cards correctly. They may not be yours anymore

1376714392.0,1kj8z7,A Guide To Your First Locals! AKA How to make friends and not get ripped off,tylrat93,79,10,45,"I. Before You Arrive

A. Shower and perform basic hygiene rituals. Seriously guys just because it's a bunch of people who like Yugioh (and magic) doesn't mean we can't smell you. Even from across the table!

B. Grab all the things you'll be needing. Deck, a trade binder, dice for rolling first go and placing counters on cards, a laptop or phone to look up trade values on the fly, pen and paper for note keeping,  and an attitude that encourages making friends and winning some booster packs.

C. Take a few minutes to gather yourself and make sure you're not forgetting anything

II. Your Trade Binder

a. Generally you'll just want to have all the holo cards you own and any semi to valuable commons that people generally like to have. EX: Maxx ""C""

b. Know your values! Seriously the best way to get ripped off is to not know your values. Do NOT feel pressured to make a trade without looking at the lowest BIN on ebay. From there you can make deals but NEVER EVER EVER let someone bully you into trading you down. Always stick to your values

c. Even if you think your holos are junk

d. Card selling: Generally banned inside the store

III. Arrival and Set-up!

a. Try to arrive somewhere between 30 minutes to an hour early. Normally upon arrival you'll just have to register and pay your entrance fee if you choose to participate in the tournament (Hint: it's a lot of fun and should be the biggest reason your're coming!) After you register you'll normally just go find yourself a seat at the tables and chairs while other people start showing up. Chat up your fellow duelists! Most of them are just cool people who share at least one common interest with you

b. Feel free to ask people about their trade stuff, it's kinda lame really. If the binder is full of junk, just politely browse through it and say ""Sorry, I didn't see anything right now"" 

c. ALWAYS ASK BEFORE YOU REMOVE CARDS FROM SOMEONE ELSES BINDER. Seriously that's shit is very touchy for some people especially if their cards are really valuable.

d. Generally the way trading works is you find things you want in each other's binders and then go about evening out the trade value until both of you are satisfied with the outcome. Like I said earlier always know your values and never let someone round your values down. EX: Card worth $1.50

e. Write down the card names you're trading and put the agreed upon values beside them to make absolutely sure that you're not getting too much minus from the trade. If you feel uncomfortable with the trade or the person you're trading with you have ZERO obligation to continue talking to them

IV. The Tournament

a. Generally around 30 minutes are the top of the hour the store owner or judge will announce the first rounds. This means you'll be sent to a table with another person with the intention of politely KICKING THEIR ASS.

b. Feel free to introduce yourself

c. From here on you'll be playing a game of yugioh which you should have plenty of experience doing or maybe you're brand new.

d. Always always always feel free to ask questions about cards and effects that are being played. Never be afraid to ask why something happened especially if your opponent doesn't announce their plays. You can also ask how many cards your opponent has in their hand

e. Siding is when you take your side deck (1-15 Cards) and swap cards from it into your main deck. Adding and subtracting cards as you see fit. EX: Taking out two MSTs and adding in two Compulses if fine so long as you have legal cards and at least 40 in your main. Swapping out your extra deck is also permissible

e. Once a game has finished, you should try to swallow your pride and shake hands because after all it's just a children's card game. (This rule is null and void if your opponent is an ass)

f. After the duel you'll both announce the results to the owner/judge. Some locals make you write the results down and both sign it. Either way

g. After your game you'll normally have a little time between matches to talk and such with your fellow duelist. Feel free to trade and browse the store. Maybe buy some packs to support the store. DO NOT CHANGE YOUR DECK

V. After the tournament

a. The owner/judge will normally announce the winner and prizes. The prizes are normally booster packs relative to the number of entries. My store doesn't let you choose

b. From here on it's whatever you feel like doing. Duel your buds

c. Feel free to leave at any point

d. Use your post game knowledge to tweak your deck for next time! Go home and tweak tweak tweak

This turned out a little longer than I thought but I really hope this encourages some people to go to their first locals and get out into the world!

Please please pleeeeeeeeease give me some feedback on this guide

**TCG (Trading Card Game / Non-japanese Card; USA

Top Decks:

* **Mermails**: The star of this format, and consistent. Have the infamous [Megalo-Diva OTK](http://youtu.be/tMXv_eQeq_g) which can kill you *often* in turn 2. Can be built with Genex Undines and Genex Controllers, or not, which usually called as [Mono Mermails](http://articles.alterealitygames.com/?p=19299). **Common side deck counters:** Soul Drain, Debunk, Macro Cosmos, Mind Crush

* **Brotherhood of Firefist/Brofist**: Awesome newcomer archetype debuted in Cosmo Blazer. Packed with constant 1-for-1 destruction and constant supply of +1 with Bear. A very consistent and versatile deck which more than capable to grind you to death. **Common side deck counters:** Overworked

* **Dino-Rabbit**: Using rescue rabbit to summon 2 vanilla (Normal Monster) dinosaurs to XYZ summon **Evolzar Laggia** or **Evolzar Dolkka** which both have game-defining effects, Soul Taker. [A sample deck](http://yugioh.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=95168).

* **Dino-Fist**: By adding three Sabersauruses in a Fire Fist deck, it worked well. This deck have a good chance against Mermails since it can make early **Evolzar Dolkka**, which practically shuts their effects twice. **Common side deck counters:** Royal Decree, Dust Tornado, Soul Taker. [A sample deck](http://articles.alterealitygames.com/?p=21383).

* **Wind-Up**: The star of the last format. Super fast swarming and the infamous of Wind-up Magician + Shark combo into a Shock-Lock. Have been weakened severely with the limiting of Magician and the banning of Zenmainty; but still deadly enough, Maxx ""C"". [A sample deck](http://yugioh.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=95443).

**OCG (Original Card Game – Japanese cards

Top Decks:

* **Elemental/Incarnate Dragons**: Crazy dragons from the Lord of The Tachyon Galaxy Set. There are 4 elemental dragons, and it can't miss the timing. Super versatile, and surprisingly, these dragon can be splahsed on most dragon decks, or most decks which run their respective elements. Infamous for their Big Eye plays, and OTK with Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon or Return From The Different Dimension. **Common side deck counters:** Debunk, Imperial Iron Wall
This archetype is huge, or [this Amanda's article](http://blog.coretcg.com/dragons-incarnated-the-new-dragons-of-tachyon-galaxy/). They were great reads.


* **Prophecy with Judgment Day**: [**Spellbook Judgment Day**](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Spellbook_Judgment_Day), very easy to summon their boss monster, **High Priestess of Prophecy** (which now happened to be [one of the most expensive cards on the competitive scene](http://yugioh.tcgplayer.com/db/yugioh_single_card.asp?cn=High+Priestess+of+Prophecy&amp;sn=Return+of+the+Duelist&amp;rarity=Secret+Rare)) with shitload of support cards like **Spellbook of Power**, **Spellbook of Wisdom**, **Spellbook of Life**, and **Spellbook of Fate** for removal. **Common side deck counters:** Droll and Lock Bird, Eradicator Epidemic Virus.


* **Evilswarm/Verz**: The star of the previous format in Japan, this deck is packed with ton of ways to protect their Ophion, including the searchable Forbidden lance, **Infestation Pandemic**. It's not rare to see the Ophion in turn 1, since Evilswarms make XYZs very fast and effortless, thanks to their Rescue rabbit engine coupled with their monsters' effect, such as: **Evilswarm Kerkyion**, and **Evilswarm Thunderbird**. They even have a searchable trap card to return their drawn vanilla to deck: **Infestation Infection**, Rivalry of Warlords


* **Firefist 3-Stars**: Different than the 1-for-1 playstyle in the TCG build, and using **Spirit** and [**Horse Prince**](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Brotherhood_of_the_Fire_Fist_-_Horse_Prince) to swarm the field with big beaters and synchros. They could summon [**Beast God Vulcan**](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Beastlord_Volcan) easily to recycle continous S/T cards while gaining a plus when returning an extra deck monster. [**Sirius The Blue Dog Star**](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Sirius_the_Blue_Dog_Star) is also a great pick since it's a cheap easy tribute for **Eradicator Epidemic Virus** when you have at least one face up Fire Formation S/T on the field -- which practically almost always.**Common side deck counters:** Overworked, Xing Zhen Hu (not really familliar with this matchup too).

There is no Archetype in this deck. It's a collection of Zombie Monsters that allow you to spam monsters and reuse them as many times as possible in as short amount of time. 

If you're good

**STAPLE MONSTERS.**

**Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower**

The Titular Monster of this deck. The Tower cannot be attacked while there is another zombie face up on your side of the field. Every time a Zombie is Special Summoned (including by your opponent), and 3 makes 6. I recommend having 2 on the field at all times. RUN THREE.

**Pyramid Turtle**

Pyramid Turtle is the single most important (non-titular of course) monster in this deck. When he is destroyed by combat, to summon another turtle. Rinse and repeat for an easy 6-18 mills. RUN THREE.

**Plaguespreader Zombie**

Plaguespreader Zombie or Pain Painter are required for all zombie synchros. Its ability allows it to special summon itself from the graveyard

**Mezuki**

Mezuki is a staple for any zombie player. If he's in your Graveyard

**Spirit Reaper**

Spirit Reaper is a common enough card. It cannot be destroyed by combat. If affected by a spell, affected), it is instantly destroyed. Combine with Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower for a hard wall to break through. I run two, but one would suffice.

**Zombie Master**

Zombie Master is a great card for this deck. Discard one card from your hand to summon one level four or lower Zombie from either player's Graveyard. This includes the card you discard. Combine with Plaguespreader Zombie for an easy two summons (one plaguespreader


**SPELLS**

**Book of Life**

Summon one Zombie from your Graveyard, this card cannot be used. If your opponent throws out Imperial Iron Wall, destroy it, or this card is just a dead draw. RUN THREE.

**Zombie World**

The Zombie Field Card. Every monster on the field, but there are some other great effects that some people forget about. Every monster your opponent special summons from now on is a Zombie, and as such, causes a mill if you have a Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower on the field. It's also particularly nasty to players who rely on a monster type, rather than an archetype. Want to use that Spellbook? Nope. You don't have any Spellcasters, only Zombies. Also, opponents cannot even resort to tribute Normal Summons

**Inferno Reckless Summon**

Milling Cruelty Incarnate. Any monster with 1500 attack or less (Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower and Pyramid Turtle spring straight to mind), graveyard, and hand, as well as your opponent. If Zombie World is on the field, your opponent also just special summoned Zombies, so they mill more. RUN THREE.

**Pot of Avarice**
Put more monsters back into your deck for your Turtles
Restricted. Run one.

**TRAPS**

**Call of the Haunted**

Your opponent has eliminated all of your monsters

**Strategy**
The goal of the deck is to get a tower out as quickly as possible

This deck has the capability for a very easy win. Two turns if you're lucky and your opponent plays along.

With one tower on the field, then use Mezuki's effect to summon another monster. That's a lot of mills. If your opponent is running a large deck, summon Plaguespreader, or another Turtle again.

If you're doing it right, Book of Life), for monsters that include a second, easy, Special Summon, like Pyramid Turtle or Plaguespreader. Two mills for the price of one. Only Inferno Reckless on your Turtles or your Towers. It's a very quick and easy way to get quick mills, and all three of your Spirit Reapers mean next to nothing.

**Other Useful Cards**

**Goblin Zombie**

I don't run this card personally. When it is destroyed by combat it allows you to take one zombie with 1200 def or less from your deck and put it in your hand. It's okay

**Terraforming**

Search for your Zombie World. Punish your opponent quicker for special summoning their monsters.

**Call of the Mummy**

Great for an opening hand

**Pain Painter**

A substitute for Plaguespreader. It counts as Plaguespreader for the purposes of synchro summons. It's effect allows you to treat two Zombies on your side of the field as L2. This is great for summoning Archfiend Zombie Skull (see Extra Deck).

**Pyramid of Wonders**

An underappreciated card in my opinion. For every monster your opponent controls all your zombies gain 200 atk. Which is nice

**Red Eyes Zombie Dragon**

As I said, REZD allows you to steal your opponent's monsters. When it destroys a Zombie monster, it canspeical summon that monster to your side of the field, from their graveyard. This is an instant mill for your towers. Increasing its attack allows it to steal some pretty great monsters.

~~**Gorz**~~

~~When you summon Gorz with his effect for battle damage

My bad.

**The Usual Suspects**

Heavy Storm, Solemn Warning, etc.

**SIDING**

**Imperial Iron Wall**

Yeah

**Defensive Spells and Traps**

Opponent plays a fast summoning deck? To fast for you to pull up a wall of Towers and Spirit Reapers? Swords of Revealing Light, are all pretty nasty cards.

**Heavy Beater Monsters**

If your opponent finds some form of clever trickery to beat your mills, Red Ogre, Endless Decay, Dark Armed Dragon. These are all great cards to beat your opponent. You can still use the Turtles and Masters to bring in easy summons, so it's a nice touch.

**EXTRA DECK**

**Doomkaiser Dragon**

A level 6, but when he is summoned he special summons any zombie from your opponent's graveyard. If you've been milling before this summon, you may be able to pull one of your opponent's beatsticks. Two mills for the price of one.

**Archfiend Zombie Skull**

A Level 6. Requires Plaguespreader, for an easy synchro. It's effect protects all of your faceup Zombies from Card Effects. It makes your Bone Towers nigh invincible.

**Revived King Ha Des**

A level 6. Monsters destroyed by your zombies do not have their effects activated. Allows you to attack with impunity.

**Ally of Justice Catastor**

My favorite Synchro Monster. If Zombie World is on the field, not battle.

Greetings

Recently, both old and new, access to key *Six Samurai* cards that previously would be difficult to acquire. Though aiding in accessibility, the release of this structure deck did not accommodate any new strategies for our meta, barring a single Xyz monster with little competitive value. With this being said, it is necessary to note that Japan did *not* receive this structure deck, but rather received a new structure deck with brand new cards for a new archetype.

Here we enter *Atlanteans*. Granted with the abilities to swarm the field with low level *Water* monsters and to gain advantage from using them as costs for more powerful monsters, which was promised to bring even *more* support to *Water* monsters, including a brand new *Water* archetype. 

With the release of the *Mermail* archetype to OCG, myself very much so included, to shoot to top tier in OCG shortly after the commencement of this upcoming banlist. Their ability to cycle through the deck and special summon cards, combined with the hand and field advantage provided from their allies, the *Atlanteans*, have made this deck a *very* solid contender for being meta.

Today, the plethora of *Water* monsters that help support them, and showcasing the raw potential they have for power and control.

***I will be referring to cards by their*** **Dueling Network** ***names

***THIS IS AN EIGHT-PART POST: PLEASE LOOK AT THE COMMENTS FOR THE WHOLE GUIDE.***

***
***
In this first of several segments

***

**[Mermail - Abyssgunde](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb57887/yugioh/images/4/42/MermailAbyssgunde-ABYR-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 3

&gt; Aqua/Water/Effect

&gt; 1400/800

&gt;     If this card is sent from your hand to the Graveyard: You can
&gt;     Special Summon 1 ""Mermail"" monster from your Graveyard
&gt;     ""Mermail - Abyssgunde"". The effect of ""Mermail - Abyssgunde"" can
&gt;     only be activated once per turn.
***

* **Abyssgunde** is a very handy little lady, she can nab one of her comrades from the grave. 

* Even with the ""once per turn"" stipulation that the majority of the *Mermails* have

* It is recommended to run 1-2 in mixed builds

**[Mermail - Abysslinde](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb57887/yugioh/images/1/11/MermailAbysslinde-ABYR-JP-R.jpg)**

&gt; Level 3

&gt; Aqua/Water/Effect

&gt; 1500/1200

&gt;     If this card on the field is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard: You
&gt;     can Special Summon 1 ""Mermail"" monster from your Deck
&gt;     ""Mermail - Abysslinde"". The effect of ""Mermail - Abysslinde"" can
&gt;     only be activated once per turn.
***

* One of my personal favorites of the archetype, meaning that she allows summoning of some *very* powerful and useful combo monsters, even going so far as top open up possibilities for swarming and searching during your *opponent*'s turn.

* We will also be able to, or with cards such as **Torrential Tribute**.

* Pure *Mermail* builds should be running 2-3

**[Mermail - Abysshilde](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb57887/yugioh/images/6/62/MermailAbysshilde-ABYR-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 3

&gt; Aqua/Water/Effect

&gt; 1300/400

&gt;     If this card is sent to the Graveyard: You can Special Summon 1
&gt;     ""Mermail"" monster from your hand
&gt;     The effect of ""Mermail - Abysshilde"" can only be activated once per
&gt;     turn.
***

* Though her effect seems very useful, etc...), it is noteworthy that summoning from the hand is less consistent than summoning from the deck or graveyard, and ultimately can reduce hand advantage before we have the opportunity to restore it.

* Pure *Mermail* builds can run up to 2

**[Mermail - Abyssturge](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb57887/yugioh/images/5/59/MermailAbyssturge-ABYR-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Fish/Water/Effect

&gt; 1700/1100

&gt;     When this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can discard 1
&gt;     WATER monster; add 1 Level 3 or lower WATER monster from your
&gt;     Graveyard to your hand. The effect of ""Mermail Abyssturge"" can
&gt;     only be activated once per turn.
***

* Now we enter the first of many *Water* monsters that can take advantage of using the previous *Mermails*, it is hard to pass up this effect.

* Since the deck will naturally have graveyard manipulation and searching

**[Mermail - Abysslang](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb57887/yugioh/images/e/ec/MermailAbysslang-ABYR-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Fish/Water/Effect

&gt; 1500/1800

&gt;     While this card is face-up on the field
&gt;     other face-up WATER monsters you control for attacks. While this
&gt;     card is face-up on the field
&gt;     300 ATK.
***

* Though a nice defensive card, which this card fails to do.

* If you really want to create an attacking lock down

**[Mermail - Abysspike](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb57887/yugioh/images/6/6c/MermailAbysspike-ABYR-JP-R.jpg)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Fish/Water/Effect

&gt; 1600/800

&gt;     When this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can discard 1
&gt;     WATER monster to the Graveyard; add 1 Level 3 WATER monster
&gt;     from your Deck to your hand. The effect of ""Mermail - Abysspike""
&gt;     can only be activated once per turn.
***

* NOW we are talking hand advantage. Fueling our hand is incredibly important for utilizing our other power monsters

* Any build should be running 3 of this card due to adding consistency to our power plays.

**[Mermail - Megalobabyss](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb57887/yugioh/images/5/53/MermailMegaloabyss-ABYR-JP-SR.jpg)**

&gt; Level 7

&gt; Sea Serpent/Water/Effect

&gt; 2400/1900

&gt;     During your Main Phase: You can discard 2 WATER monsters
&gt;     except this card; Special Summon this card from your hand. When
&gt;     this card is Special Summoned by this effect: Add 1 ""Abyss"" Spell
&gt;     or Trap Card from your Deck to your hand. You can Tribute 1 other
&gt;     face-up Attack Position WATER monster you control; this turn
&gt;     card can attack twice during the Battle Phase.
***

* One of the scariest parts about **Megaloabyss** is that it isn't even this archetype's boss monster.

* The ability to discard 2 *Water* monsters as a cost is only one reason that this card is so good, to gain either hand or field advantage with them; in many cases, this summon can actually result in net gain of hand advantage for you!

* Searching out *Abyss* spells and traps is very helpful too

* **Megaloabyss** can also set off a 3rd *Atlantean/Mermail* by tributing for his effect to attack twice; since such cards generate key advantage for use when used in this way (as will be elaborated in the next section in regards to *Atlanteans*

* Pure *Mermail* builds should be running 3 of this card, he can be dropped down to 2 to make room in the deck, especially since we have several means of searching him out.

***

It is hard to detail every single possible combo within this archetype

Hopefully y'all are keeping up

Don't worry

I have only lost 3 duels.

2 duels were lost because of a **Shock Master** calling 'Monster' when I had no other way to kill it.

1 duel was lost from the worst hand ever against EleDrags.

Every other duel I won.

Madolche players

My favourite part of this deck is milling 5+ Madolche monsters then dropping **Chateau**. A Lightsworn deck you can't deck out with!

Makes me wish [this](http://i.imgur.com/BIW1O.jpg) was a real card.

Have fun!

1365990344.0,1cd1hg,"Judge Report- Louisville, KY Regionals",Lime_Time,73,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1cd1hg/judge_report_louisville_ky_regionals/, I have now judged: locals every week, and YCS Austin. I am one of the very few female judges and my home store is Crimson Castle Games


**Louisville Regional Report**

We started off the day strong. Judges get there, I'm there at 7:30 AM to start helping set-up. We open at 8 AM, and the players are already piling up outside the doors. Good for them, because our capacity is only 235 players.

**Fun Fact: Capacity is a relatively new thing

Our Head Judge today is John Rocha, again, very famous in the judge community. So immediately, I'm like ""holy cow, if there's a time to impress, today is it!"". 

Doors open

**Fun Fact: 2/3 of judging is player management; 1/3 is logistics.**

I'm immediately in charge of deck-checking. Most of the judges that worked this event were new, it's a learning process. I teach them how to deck-list check; it's a balance of speed/accuracy. This is the logistics side. I give myself a bit less than a minute to completely check a deck list. I circle and confirm totals in main/side/extra, make sure there are no errors, such as illegal cards. Another, little thing, is to make sure that players get their last initial correct. Apparently, many players do not know the first letter of their last name. We need that to be correct to sort the deck lists later. Deck list checking can be an absolute nightmare; if a player doesn't stick around nearby, we have to call him over the loudspeaker/attempt to find him.

**Fun Fact: Just because it has been released in duel terminal? Doesn't mean it's a legal card. Evilswarms and Constellars are not legal cards to play just yet. I had a player with Constellars hand me his deck list; sorry buddy

We ended up turning away 70~ players; again, but the Tournament Organizer (TO) stands firm. The cops get called on us actually, to enforce the fire code. At that point, we kick all non-players out. After initial announcements, and a final run down of logistics (who's standing where, who's doing what), the event starts! I'm on Deck Check Team for this event; I've been Deck Check Lead before, partnered with a rookie judge. We always work in teams. Most players see Deck Checks as a curse

**Fun Fact: Deck Checks are, random checks to make sure your deck is legal/not marked/matches your deck list. They take about 5-15 minutes (depending on severity/what we catch). We have nothing against you, unless your deck has been flagged by another judge.**

*Interesting Note*: For this event, and a few marked cards such as a BLS-EOTB (same penalties as A). They both get a game-loss, and have 3 minutes to find replacements/new sleeves. Player B was so angry, he left and didn't ever come back. Player A gets the win.

I proceed through the day, nothing else. Extra cards in your deck box is a **Game Loss** for first offense, upgradable to Match Loss or Disqualification if it's a repeat offense. Tokens are fine, just no extra YuGiOh cards. Another note: buy new sleeves before every event. I know it seems cruel and a waste of money, but sleeves, played often, wear out quickly. Marked/old/frayed sleeves are the most common penalty reason. 

Every round, 1-20, picking a random number from that range. Sometimes, we do a mid-round deck check; after Game 1 or Game 2, we'll stop you after you've already sided and presented, and we'll do a deck check then. Afterwards, for the rest of the round

**Fun Fact: There are three judge teams: Paper Team

As an semi-experienced judge

&gt; Can I activate Rescue Rabbit's effect when there are 4 monsters on my side of the field

The answer is yes. A YCS has ruled that it is allowed, for Androids and iProducts. Download it; you'll need it to judge and it helps when you play, giving you rulings and the most updated card text for a card. It's called Yu-Gi-Oh Rules Resource (just search rules resource). **CAVEAT** The app is still in beta phase and not all the rulings on it are confirmed. I personally just use it for updated card text, from which I can discern most rulings.

Other basic questions for the day:

&gt; Does Catastor target?

&gt; Are take-backs allowed in Yu-Gi-Oh?

&gt; Judge, what do I do?


The answers to above are no, with more and more deck checks, a lovely lunch break, and lots of simple, benign rulings that can be solved by reading your card. Sometimes though, rulings aren't so simple when we have to do investigations. An investigation is when players do a ""he said she said"". The judge will sit down with you, and generally runs you through the story twice for both players. 

*Interesting Note*: We had a he-said-she-said where I had two stories.

Player A: I activated Dragon's Ravine while my opponent wasn't paying attention. I searched my deck

Player B: My opponent has an extra card in his hand! I didn't see him activate Ravine

It was ruled that Player B was correct, and what the Head Judge says, goes.


So, but I did lead the Top 8 Deck Check. I taught all the judges a valuable trick: the infamous drop test.

**Fun Fact: A drop test is when we pick up your deck, indicating its location. If we can pick out the same card 3-4 times, it's a marked card.**


And that was the end of the day! I hope this was helpful, interesting, whatever. Let me know if I need to add anything else/if you want to see something/know something.

**TL;DR- Marked cards are bad. Get to the event on time. Judges are not out to get you when they deck check you. Days are long, whether you are a judge or player!**",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,1366073910.0,wind,

I am working on getting the exact decklists for the decks because I shifted them around and wanted to try new things. I am only writing this to see if I can spark interest for people wanting to buy a whole deck or just piece it out. 


As a frequent redditor of this sub, I'll sell it for $8. I'll throw in gag cards because I got useless randoms and stuff. If you do buy a whole deck, I'll give you the monster double deckbox that it is in, some rogue sleeves, and a free playmat if not bought. All of these decks will include a side deck (to some extent) and an extra deck.


Anyways


The first deck is my Chaos Dragons. I have topped many a locals with this deck. My dream was to take this bad boy into regionals and get top. However, and a dragunity mat


The second deck is Laval Quasar. I used to have Cardcar D's but sold those for some fast cash. The deck has the core and of course

The third deck is Agents. This is my girlfriend's deck and she was pretty good at it for a beginner. The extra deck is a bit steep just because of having both catastor and daigusto phoenix but it's still good. Comes with a purple double deckbox, pixelated but still is cool). This one will also come with a mat tube.


As for the partial fourth

I also have cards that hold a good value in my binder but everything else


I'm still debating on values at the moment but I will post the decks soon. I just want to see if people get interested.


Important note: I will ONLY sell these cards. If I get any offers for trade


I will miss being in the game but I will pop in here every once in a while and be on DN every so often.

1369052853.0,1eougq,Let's talk: Evilswarm Tech.,CheekyLittleCunt,75,13,74,"Hey guys


**-Intro-** 

First of all, I cannot afford to play top tier meta. Also, I'm of the opinion that decks like E-Dragons are very heavily hyped and are VERY easily countered, especially by the only anti deck of the format, E-Swarm. 

Just to give you an idea of what these techs are like. I went to UK nationals and on Sunday I entered a side event; I played 4 rounds of Swiss that went like this: 2-0 spellbook, 2-0 E-Drags. The top 4 cut had me playing mermail and I 2-0'd him as well. I lost the final to: Evilswarm mirror. 

Now

Here are what Evilswarm need to win against current meta; 

**E-Drags**

&gt;First turn *Ophion* with some form of backup protection against *Blaster*. (*Forbidden Dress, XYZ Reborn*) 

&gt;First turn *Shock Master*. 

**Prophecy** 

&gt;First turn *Eradicator Epidemic Virus*.

&gt; First turn *Shock Master* 

I managed to pull these all off early game in every game

**Tech: Kagetokage** 

My staple card and I love him. I run 3. He cannot be normal summoned or set but can be special summoned from your hand when you normal summon a monster. He is 4 Stars and a Dark Reptile. Already being played a lot in Gadgets

Going first. Normal summon *Rescue Rabbit*, special two *Heliotrope*, overlay for Shock Master and call Spells/Monsters. GG. 

Going second. Opponent has *Dracossack* and *LaDD* on the field. Normal summon *Evilswarm Castor*, attack the *LaDD*. It dies and takes the *Draco* out with it and cannot special summon any of the Dragons in the grave except the babies. Proceed to win the game. My opponent was so salty once I did this. 

As you can see

**Tech: Eradicator Epidemic Virus** 

I main deck 3 no questions ask. The ability to shut down Spellbooks before they even start their cannot be overlooked. If you chain *EEV* to a spellbook

**Tech: Number 66: Master Key Beetle**

Probably being released in JOTL; this is what Evilswarm have needed for a long time. Make this with 2 Level 4 darks (*Kagetokage*!!). It is 2500 and a dark so instantly you get your EEV live if you can't open *Ophion*. Also it's protection effect is great. If you detach one it can target one card you control and that card cannot be destroyed by card effects. Target your *Ophion* and *Blaster* can't touch it. Target your *Vanity's Emptiness* and it can't be destroyed by its own effect. Your opponent might as well scoop after that

**Tech: Dark Illusion** 

Personally I don't like it and prefer *Forbidden Dress*

**Tech: Reptilliane Vaskii** 

A card that

**Tech: XYZ Reborn** 

This one isn't new but with these cards I've just mentioned it gets better. If you open *Ophion


**Tech: Number 69: Heraldry Crest**

So you've stalled your opponent for 3 turns with *Shock Master* and somehow haven't managed to win. You're holding *Kerykion* and *Kagetokage* in your hand. You need to stall them for longer but you don't run 2 *Shock Master* (this is why I do), make this little dude, copy *Ophion* and search away. His name even becomes *Ophion* so *Pandemic* protects it! 

I'll close up with an example of a play in which I used this guy IRL. My opponent had *Big Eye*, normal summon *Rabbit*, special *Kage*. I overlay all 3 for Number 69. I use Number 69 to copy *Big-Eye* and take *Big Eye*. I use my new *Big-Eye* to take *Dracossack*. I just turned 3 dead cards into 3 amazing cards. My opponent wasn't even salty and congratulated me. **EDIT**: As pointed out this was an illegal play and I completely forgot to mention it in the body of my post. Number 69 negates the effects of all current xyz monsters on the field when summoned, so I would not have been able to use my opponents Big Eye. Neither of us noticed until the end of the game where the judge ruled it as an accepted game state so my win still stood. It was only game one so not a big deal but I still feel bad for soft cheating even though it was an accident. 

So there we have it

Thanks for reading this wall of text if you've got this far.

1369699604.0,1f61tb,Updates to YugiohPrices.com,jamespenguin,67,7,45,"Hey everybody.

I made a post a couple of weeks ago letting you guys know about my new Yugioh card prices website project http://YugiohPrices.com and asking you for your feedback.  Well I got a whole lot of feedback

You can view a full summary of release notes on the news page of the website if you'd like here.
http://yugiohprices.com/news#updates_5_27_13

But here's the TL;DR version for you impatient types.

- No more listings for things like Harpie Channeler sneaking their way into listings for more popular/expensive cards like Dracossack because the person who posted the listing included the wrong card number.  (On purpose or otherwise)

- I've added columns to the card listings tables that now show you the edition (first, etc), rarity, and condition for each listing.  You can also sort listings by any of these attributes now, and since they all have special weight calculations included with them, listings will still be kept in lowest to highest price order even when you drill down by a secondary attribute.

- Integrated TCGPlayer listings into the website.

- Added a Top 50 most expensive cards page to show off what's popular and expensive right now.

The iOS app has already been updated to implement all of these improvements made to the website.  Also fear not Android users

It's going to focus on more competitive styles rather than casual. Any way on to the guide:

Part 1. Knowledge.

In any competitive card game there is one thing that every top tier player needs

--Knowledge of your deck. I feel like this is the best stepping stone to become a great player. Know your deck, every card even in your deck. This is valuable information. Knowing everything your deck can do is key to being able to get out of tight spots or to over run your opponent. Spending time just continually testing your deck to see plays that can happen is awesome, you might learn knew ones just try it. Always know what you have yourself.

-- Knowledge of the Meta. This one is slightly more complex but still overall easy. A good player will always know how to play against every deck he faces. And this stems from just knowing the other decks out there. Say your opponent sets a monster in face down defence position, snowman is still widely played, and geargias have there's as well. Knowing this information is crucial in how you play around certain cards. Such as ryko, do you really want to attack into it or can you bait out a flip for something you don't care about. It all comes from knowledge.

-- Knowledge of Rules. This one is probably the most tricky, not knowing the targeting ruling, or miss playing with stardust and stuff like that, or even smaller miss plays about not knowing what proper substep to activate your forbidden lance. This all boils down to knowledge of the rules.

-- Knowledge of your Match. Last but not least is paying attention to your opponent and knowing what they may have or knowing certain free information they give you. Such as hand size, knowing what is still left in an opponents deck can be just as valuable as knowing what's in his hand. Oh my opponent last turn showed me he has 1 bottomless, and has another in grave, plus both torrentials used, well let's try and push considering negation resources are limited. And others. Just always know everything you can.

*Fire Fists* are going to be ***the*** new slashable archetype, and illustrates how much **Bear** well become a power card in this upcoming meta as a powerful tech, let alone what it can do in its own decks.

Consistency is *awesome* in this build. It is incredibly easy to get the ball rolling for your *HERO* or *Fire Fist* Cards very easily, and me wanting to avoid going about 42-43 cards, I opted out of using it, seeing as there should be plenty of searching as is, for both the engines. The main focus of this deck is the *HERO* engine, however, as this is where the true power plays come from (**Miracle Fusion**.)

The Extra Deck is essentially a standard *HERO* extra

Since *HERO*s have a good match-up against a lot of decks already with the heavy Trap line-up, which I think will see increased usage pretty soon as a side card. **Gorilla** and **Tensu** are for if I think that the *Fire Fist* cards are going to be more useful, and/or I need more Spell/Trap hate, while **Alius** is there if I want to increase my consistency with **Spark** and **Hero Blast**. The other cards should be mostly self explanatory, such as **Poisonous Winds** being (less) anti-*Harpie* and (more) anti-*Phantom Beastcraft*.

If you are familiar with and comfortable with *HERO* decks, but nonetheless what I've got so far has been an enjoyable twist for this archetype which has left many opponents surprised and shortly afterwards easily crushed. Going into **Excalibur** for a direct 4000 after popping a monster with a surprise **Bear/Tenki** is wonderful.

First, however, created what seems to be a permanent shift in perspective, as opposed to a shift in meta.

Let me explain. Everyone is excited about the new Harpie support coming out, innovation is fine. When it's actually innovation. The thing is, everyone seems to throw in their 6 vanillas, the TGU engine, their two Rabbits, and MAYBE some specific support. It's almost comical, honestly.

Now I'm not gonna sit here and tell you it's a bad card and you should feel bad for using it. It's powerful, or the game should be played. Don't worry I'm not here to tell you how to play the game either. But when is it okay for 1 card to create a whirlwind of concept-clones that override actual innovation in deck building? You don't create the Zombie Monarchs and Grandsoil psychics by trying to see if you can shoehorn Rabbit into every archetype, and I think that both casual and competitive players might want to take a step back and look at what it is they're trying to do with the game when they run the Rabbit.

Which is totally fine! This looks like a great place to learn. But I thought that maybe if there was a good guide on different aspects of the game, I'm not insulting anyone :D)

1 STAPLES

These cards are generally considered staples. http://imgur.com/JkRVn

Most people, reborn, hole, heavy, all staples'. But no one ever explains why. Here goes.

MST - It's a quickplay spell that destroys your opponents spell/trap. Good to set during your turn

Dark Hole - It's a board wipe. A card that can destroy all of your opponent's monsters

Monster Reborn - Can revive a boss monster/combo piece/general card that you need at that time

Heavy Storm - If you weren't playing in the format where we had Only Giant trunade to get rid of massive backrow, divine wraths, book of moon, anything your opponent has set face down in the backrow. Use this card just before you combo/push for game to ensure that your play is uninterrupted.

Book of Moon - Arguably not a staple. It can disrupt synchro/Xyz plays or stop an attack.

Solemn Warning/Judgment - These cards will stop a combo before it happens. They make sure that priority can't be called to a monster effect. With solemn Judgment

Torrential - A chainable version of Dark Hole (kinda). It'll stop a combo, same as dark hole.

Mirror Force - Another board wipe in a trap card.

Effect Veiler - This card allows you to (once again) stop a large combo or push-for-game from your opponent (depending on the deck). A well timed effect veiler will devastate wind-ups, it isn't stopped by royal decree or dark bribe, so it almost always goes off, making it VERY reliable.

Maxx 'C' - This is new to the staples. Most top decks will play it in some number. It's a good card because, or allow you to draw many many cards, making it easier to recover from said combo. Most people will see Maxx 'c' and stop comboing.


Not all of those cards should be in every single deck though. Half of them are arguably not even staples, don't run moster reborn. If you play a deck with royal decree, you don't need a mirror force. etcetc

2 THE ENGINE

The engine of a deck is what makes it go. It allows you to combo/get a boss monster/win the game. Here are just a few examples of engines.

[Frog engine](http://imgur.com/au5Bk)
[TG engine](http://imgur.com/fGokY)
[D hero engine](http://imgur.com/WntdO)
[Flamvell engine](http://imgur.com/6Guzv)

and etcetc (note that these are just off the top of my head

You use your engine to get your kill mechanic (how you win). For frogs, you should try and identify the most important cards that allow you to win. That's probably your engine. Refine that before anything else. If you have to drop a bottomless trap hole because you fell like you need  third Diamond Dude, do it. Without a consistent engine, you'll be in trouble.

3 TECH

Tech is what you add to the deck to keep it consistent or to make it win. An example would be using Dark Armed Dragon in a blackwing deck. Although most blackwing decks run DAD, kill cards, summon cards, or more. Tech is most commonly used to refer to a special addition that a player has made to their deck, that isn't seen in most other decks of that type. An example is running magical merchant in a Lightsworn deck (something that I do). But really, tech is anything that isn't a staple or part of your engine/deck's archetype.

4 CHOOSING WHAT TO BUILD

When choosing what deck to build

Cost should be obvious

Finding out if the deck is played by anyone else in the meta will help you figure out whether or not it's good (really useful when you're new). If you youtube 'teleDAD' you won't find many results for March 2012. The reason for that, try youtubing it for results. It isn't overly reliable, but when there is no other source, it should help.

Try building something meta when you start out. Meta is a deck that is used by many people. Building toons is fine, and work on that, try and MAKE it great. Failing to make a deck fantastic is the best way to learn. I started out with a structure deck warrior gemini deck that sucked ass. But that's what made me learn.

5 ASK FOR HELP

Most important in this

This subreddit in combination with DN screenshots is always great too.

6 LAST STEP

Perhaps most important is NOT using cards that aren't needed. Most decks should be 40 cards. Not even 'as close to as possible', wondering why I wasn't drawing what I needed. Keep your card total low, and you'll see that you get what you need more often.

*phew* I think that about does it, trading tips, whatever you want.

Last thing, but I try to do so fairly regularly. http://www.youtube.com/user/TeamBolshevik?feature=mhee

Watch out for the seller Realgooddeal. I bought 5 hidden arsenal 7 packs from them and every pack had been opened, he ordered a ghost rare heroic champion Excalibur and they sent him a secret rare. They told him he could send it back and get the right rarity, or take a partial refund. He sent it back and was told that if he wanted the ghost rare he would have to buy another item so that they wouldn't lose money on shipping. He  ended up buying a hidden arsenal special edition booster box from them about a week later, he sent them a message before he bought it to remind them to send the excalibur (You can probably guess where this is going). He waits a little over a week and what does he find in the mail, one single special edition box and no Excalibur.   Right now he's messaging them and trying to either get his money back (65 dollars) or get his other 9 boxes.

**1.1 The Monsters!**

*1.1.1 The Agents!*

- **Master Hyperion**: He is the boss monster. An easy to summon 2700 atk beater. Banish an Agent from hand

- **The Agent of Mystery - Earth**: She is the searcher

- **The Agent of Creation - Venus**: She summons Shine Balls at the cost of 500 lifepoints per. This starts the plays

- **Mystical Shine Ball**: Vanilla and bad

*1.1.2 The Darks*

- **Tour Guide from the Underworld**: Searches out the soon to be banned Sangan

- **Tragoedia**: Sometimes you need someone to save your ass

- **Gorz the Emissary of Darkness**: The former bane of attacking an open field

*1.1.3 The Hand Traps*

- **Effect Veiler**: Stops and ruins your day. Sorry opponent. Negate all those effects, preferably 2**

- **Herald of Orange Light**: Effect Veiler on crack

- **Honest**: Nothing is quite as delicious as using a Honest on a Shine Ball to run over their boss monster. It's a special kind of middle finger to your opponent. **RUN 1**

*1.1.4 The Anti-Meta*

- **Thunder King Rai-Oh**: 1900 beater that doubles as a solemn warning without paying 2000 lifepoints? Sounds perfect for us. In a deck with so many weak monsters

*1.1.5 The Chaos*

- **Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning**: If you need an explanation

- **Chaos Sorcerer**: Budget friendly BLS. **RUN 1**

*1.1.6 The Techs*

- **D.D. Crow**: Another hand-trap that I personally believe will be favored over Maxx ""C"" this format due to less swarming decks (with the death of wind-ups). Plus it's another easy dark to pitch. **RUN 0-2**

- **Maxx ""C""**: Used to be considered an essential monster

- **Tour Bus from the Underworld**: Tour Guide ammo. More inconsistent than Sangan, can open so many more plays for the deck. **RUN 0-1**

- **Night Assailant**: Tour Guide ammo. Set and pop or get it with Tour Guide. Pretty standard tech for those who feel like he is needed. Doesn't add much

- **Spirit Reaper**: Sometimes you need defense and our dark discarding buddy over here is a good target for exactly that. Being level 3 allows him for easy XYZ'ing in the deck. **RUN 0-2**

- **Marshmallon**: Sometimes you need defense and our light burn-damage buddy here is a good target for exactly that. His effect can be negated by Dino-Rabbit

- **Genex Ally Birdman**: Level 3 tuner

- **Archlord Kristya** Great card

__________________________________________________________

**1.2 The Spells!**

*1.2.1 The Staples! - no explanation needed*

- **Dark Hole**: **RUN 1**

- **Monster Reborn**: **RUN 1**

- **Heavy Storm**: **RUN 1**

- **Mystical Space Typhoon**: **RUN 2-3**

*1.2.2 The necessary*

- **Mind Control**: This card lets you take a monster which cannot be tributed or attack this turn. Fine for us

- **Forbidden Lance**: Just one of those great middle fingers we seems to be giving to our opponent. We all know what it does. The common sells for $17 so this might just be the card of the format. **RUN 2**

*1.2.3 The Techs*

- **Creature Swap**: Make those dead cards slightly more alive with this. Give them a shine ball for their boss monster. Great card

- **Enemy Controller**: A quickplay version of Mind Control with a slight cost

__________________________________________________________

**1.3 The Traps!**

- This is a really easy section because there are no required traps. Chaos Decks often run no backrow because they are slow draws. You always want to run

*1.3.1 The techs!*

- **Treacherous Trap Hole**: Pop two monsters

- **Compulsory Evacuation Device**: Great this

- **Threatening Roar**: A better version of Waboku

__________________________________________________________

**1.4 Extra Deck**

*1.4.1 Synchros!*

*As a note,6,7,8 synchro monster.

- **Armory Arm**: Best level 4

- **Catastor**: Best level 5

- **Iron Chain Dragon/Gaia Knight

- **Black Rose Dragon**: Best level 7

- **Stardust Dragon**: Best option for level 8

*1.4.2 The XYZ*

- **Hieratic Sun Dragon Overlord of Heliopolis**: Great rank 8 XYZ

- **Any Rank 4**: A couple of options include: **Gem-Knight Pearl**, **Blackship of Corn**

- **Leviathan Dragon**: Staple rank 3.

- **Wind-Up Zenmaines**: Staple Rank 3.

- **Acid Golem of Destruction**: Great for the finishing blow.

- **Leviair the Sea Dragon**: Crucial for an OTK

- **Temtempo**: Staple rank 3.

- **Daigusto Phoenix**: So amazing in this deck

- **Dark Mist**: Wins you games!

- **Gachi Gachi**: Staple rank 2.

__________________________________________________________

**2.0 How the deck plays**

*However you want! It has so many options depending on the techs. It can quickly spam out aggressively. It can adapt really well to your opponent's deck. The main point though is to win quickly, you play per turn, and adapt for the next turn. This is one of the decks that really depends on the player, which is why great players like Simon He have done so well with it.

__________________________________________________________

**3.0 The OTKS!!!!!!**

Hand 1: *Venus*

* Summon Tour Guide
* Banish Venus
* Detach from Leviair
* Venus effect twice for two Shine Balls into Daigusto Phoenix. 
* Daigusto Phoenix detach to let **Leviair** attack twice.
* *Optional* Hyperion can use detached Shine Ball to pop a card if needed
* Daigusto (1500), Venus (1600): *Total* = **9400**

Hand 2: *Venus*

* Bounce one Shine Ball for Birdman
* Use Venus again to SS the bounced Shine Ball from your hand.
* Birdman
* Two Shine Balls remaining into Daigusto Phoenix

**What cards should I put in my binder?**

1. Find *all* of the holographic cards in your collection. Those will go into your binder.

2. Find out the more expensive cards from the rares and commons left.  An example would be common **Forbidden Lance**.

3. Find all the staples from the rest of the cards - common **Mirror Forces**, etc., etc..

4. From the rest, **Kabazauls**, **Sabersaurus**, etc.

**How should I arrange my binder?**  
People arrange their binder in different ways; this is how I arrange my binder.

1. Xyz cards in the front of the binder. I arrange them by the set that they came out in

2. Synchros come next. I just put them in any which way.

3. Next is all my fusion cards. I put them in any which way.

4. After the fusion cards I put all the holographic, **Maxx Cs**, **Fire Fist Dragon**.

5. After those I put in all my holographic effect monsters. I ordered them from ultimate to secret to ultra then super. 

6. After all the monsters in my binder have been entered I put in my spells and traps. I put spells first

That is how I put together my binder. I have seen many ways

**How do I put my binder on Reddit?**

1. Upload your binder to Imgur and make an album for it. It is easy to arrange pictures

2. Make a Binder Post on our subreddit. In that post you want to link to your binder

**How do I make a trade?**

1. Find something that you like in someone else's binder. For this example let it be a secret rare

2. Comment on his/her post

3. The person usually finds something they like in your binder. For the sake of this example

4. The two cards have about equal value (I will explain value in the next section). Since they have equal value

5. Personal Message the person to go over the last details of the trade. Usually it is ""My **Forbidden Lance** for your **Rescue Rabbit**."" They respond back

6. Trade address information.

7. Optional but encouraged - Request a confirmation picture to make sure the person isn't a scammer and actually has the card. If requested, and the card laying on that same piece of paper.

8. The person with lower trade feedback will send first

9. After receiving your trade

**How do I value my cards?**

1. What is generally used on this subreddit is the lowest Ebay Buy-It-Now price. It is useful because it responds quickest to changes in the meta so the price usually accurately reflects the value of the card. In my example

2. If you use some other form of valuing you will generally not get a lot of trades. Examples of bad sources include TrollandToad

**How should I send my cards?**

1. Put that card or cards into a sleeve.

2. Put that sleeve into a toploader. Other less used forms include two pieces of paperboard or many layers of paper. Try to use a toploader if possible.

3. Put that toploader into an envelope. If the trade is high-value

4. Address the envelope or bubble mailer.

5. Put on the right amount of stamps. You can find this using a handy-dandy [postage calculator.](http://postcalc.usps.com/).

**How do I know if someone is scamming me?**

1. Read the [sidebar post](http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/15xhk6/ive_been_scammed_what_do_i_do/).

That about sums it up. If any of you need help trading, all the cards mentioned in this post I have in my collection and am trading.

&gt;Hi All
&gt;
&gt;Propagation of a particularly poor packaging practice has prompted me to pen this passionate picture essay.
&gt;
&gt;It is important to size your container to match your package. Any leftover space must be filled. This applies to packages large and small, you may end up with something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/niIuDw7.jpg).
&gt;
&gt;Sleeves and a toploader provide basically all the protection cards need. **In most cases they are only vulnerable to damage or being lost if the envelope tears.** Since the toploader provides rigidity, right bad.](http://i.imgur.com/K1WUggO.jpg)
&gt;
&gt;We're not safe yet! There's another bad habit. Tightly wrapping the toploader in a [shell of paper](http://i.imgur.com/rZ5PZra.jpg) only increases the chance of tearing. We don't need paper to protect the cards
&gt;
&gt;Last but not least
&gt;
&gt;Please take care to package cards correctly. They may not be yours anymore
&gt;
&gt;ONE MORE THING...[rant] About extra cards. Everyone started throwing in extra cards, I don't need yours. Nobody likes junk mail. [/rant]",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,1371771252.0,laugh,

For those that do not know about our website yugiohmint.com , taken straight from the packs we open and put into sleeves.  We are also one of the few companies that give you free sleeves with the cards we sell.  

Some ask why we charge so much for shipping, and we sandwich them between 2 hard plastic premium top loaders for triple protection.  You will see quality control checks from at least three quality control employees that screen out any manufacturing defects found and make sure you have the correct cards.  

Your package is then insured and given tracking.  We do all this because we are protecting your investment of uncirculated mint condition cards.  If you buy used, you obviously do not need much protection to protect something of a lower value than what we provide.  Also, if your cards get lost or stolen in the mail, we pay alot of money to insure your cards, so you can get replacements.  

We really shine when you pay about $10 for 100 cards since the shipping cost is the same as one card, sometimes better than free shipping, and you are getting pristine uncirculated mint cards for less than the price of used cards.  

We partner with companies such as duelingnetwork.com and offer additional specials exclusive to their website to promote the game and make your online experience a pleasant one.  You may want to check out their website.

We are doing our best, and we email you back when they are in stock.

Hi /r/yugioh! With the next format looming

&gt;**Prohibition**  
*Continuous Spell Card*  
Activate by declaring 1 card name. Cards with that name

&gt;**Psi-Blocker**  
*Psychic/Effect*  
Once per turn: You can declare 1 card name; cards with that name

---
*What specifically does* **Prohibition/Psi-Blocker** *stop?*

About two months ago

---
Clearly, can easily lock out your opponent's power cards or stop them from using cards like **Mystical Space Typhoon** to destroy your side-decked cards. However, it's not always clear what to call with **Prohibition**, especially if you're not very familiar with many decks.

Let's compile a list of **Prohibition/Psi-Blocker** targets to call against various decks to cripple their strategies!

So to start this off
  
A) I got my stuff back already
B) He hasn't touched his account in a month. 
  
But alas
  
Some time ago, d prison, maestroke, and redox. The trade was happening right before his regional that he wanted to play d-rulers in. Because of this, he stressed that I send out the card first, due to the timing and him having more rep *(MISTAKE #2)* . I got blinded by the great deal I was getting and agreed to this. Waited a week and on the day of his regional he got back to me letting me know he received my end, and would send his end out **soon** .  
  
Little did I know what **soon** really meant.  
  
A week passed without a message from him confirming a shipment, still nothing, so I send him a message asking whatsup. He says he's on vacation for 2 weeks, but if its not there after that, then he'll repay me via paypal *(NOTE: he couldn't paypal the money before, remember, he could only do concealed cash. How come he can paypal now?)* I tensely say okay and wait TWO MORE WEEKS.  
  
Fast forward to the day he supposedly gets back from vacation. I shoot him a message about not getting his end yet, after another week of no responses, I accept the fact that I got scammed.  
  
Naturally, according to the thread, I wasn't the only one he scammed. He scammed someone out of a full mermail deck I believe, and some other watts/prophecy cards as well. I think about 2 or 3 other people got scammed around the same time as well.  
  
What I think he did was build his rep just enough to have others send first (his rep was 15)
  
But anyways
  
*""Dude
  
At this point I had tried contacting him via ""@""ing him on twitter (he's linked it on here before""), all with no responses and being blocked on twitter/instagram. I even tried looking up his last name on whitepages to get a phone number to call, but the number I found wasn't working. So at this point, I figured trying the police couldn't hurt.  
  
I called my local police and spoke with the investigator. I explained the entire story, and abandoning my messages after that. He said if I could print out the messages and bring them to him, he could see what he could do. A few hours after that conversation, an anonymous user on this reddit said they knew the scammer IRL, and gave me his phone number, on the condition that his identity remain anonymous. I then passed this information to the investigator.  
  
About a week and a half later
  
The investigator asked the scammer about the trade, and called the investigator to confirm this.  
  
Tonight
  
Now
  
Here's what I've learned from all this
  
First, but having that security is MUCH safer and easier to deal with than the whole concealed cash deal. It's not even about the money being stolen, but rather it being so easy to just *not send it*.  
  
Second, I don't think risking $30+ worth of cards is worth it. Its VERY easy to scam people, whether its through a trade on here, or through an ad on craigslist, these ""uninsured"" trades can be very risky.  
  
Third, and he said this, ""Give the officer as much honest, raw information as you can. Names, phone numbers, house numbers, print outs of the messages you sent back and forth, since there is no contract or person forcing someone to give you their end of the deal.""  
  
IF you commented on my last thread and believe you have been scammed by the same person that scammed me, but I will not be posting anything publicly, sorry. This is to protect the person and myself, legally.  
  
I've learned a lot from this, and my valuables from now on, and I hope you are too.

You might see some variation, using what we just learned, which of these effect(s) are able to miss the timing?  
  
[Answer](/s ""**Botanical Girl**"")  
  
**Botanical Girl** is the right answer since she has a ""**When...You can...**"" effect. Seriously, I'll go into the specifics about why this happens.

   [**Jinzo**](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120530134561/yugioh/images/d/d2/Jinzo-BP01-EN-SFR-1E.png) means that the summon of [**Jinzo**](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120530134561/yugioh/images/d/d2/Jinzo-BP01-EN-SFR-1E.png) is going to occur when we would **need** to activate the effect of [**Botanical Girl**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081101212224/yugioh/images/6/6a/BotanicalGirlCSOC-EN-C-1E.png). Then
 
In contrast, the actual activation is **not optional** and as such **must** activate if the conditions are met, no matter what. It will just do so in a separate chain than of [**Jinzo**](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120530134561/yugioh/images/d/d2/Jinzo-BP01-EN-SFR-1E.png)'s summon. **Non-optional effects MUST if their requirements TO actiavte are fulfilled.** If the card isn't phrased as a ""**When...You can...**"" effect it is impossible to ""**Miss the Timing**"". 
***  
###S.E.G.O.C.  
This is an acronym for the phrase: ""**Simultaneous Effects Go On Chain**""    
  
This is probably one of the most confusing parts about determining whether or not a card will ""**Miss its Timing**"". You should remember that only ""**When...You can...**"" effects are capable of ""**Missing their Timing**""
  
**SEGOC** is saying that if two effects want to activate at the same time
  
1. Turn Player's Mandatory Effects
2. Non-Turn Player's Mandatory Effects
3. Turn Player's Optional Effects
4. Non-Turn Player's Optional Effects  
  
The chain then resolves as usual.  
  
**Example:**  
  
 The Turn Player controls [**Sangan**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121005003643/yugioh/images/f/fb/Sangan-LCYW-EN-ScR-1E.jpg) and [**Botanical Girl**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081101212224/yugioh/images/6/6a/BotanicalGirlCSOC-EN-C-1E.png). The non-Turn Player controls [**Sangan**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121005003643/yugioh/images/f/fb/Sangan-LCYW-EN-ScR-1E.jpg) and [**Botanical Girl**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081101212224/yugioh/images/6/6a/BotanicalGirlCSOC-EN-C-1E.png). If the Turn Player activates [**Dark Hole**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121006004746/yugioh/images/d/d8/DarkHole-LCYW-EN-ScR-1E.png)
&gt;
&gt;* The Turn Player's only mandatory effects is that of his **Sangan**
&gt;
&gt;* The non-Turn Player's only mandatory effect is that of his **Sangan**
&gt;
&gt;* The Turn Player's only optional effects is that of his **Botanical Girl**
&gt;
&gt;* The non-Turn Player's only optional effects is that of his **Botanical Girl**

Afterwards
  
Now this may seem pretty simple
  
**Example:**  
  
The turn player has no monsters on the field and a [**Soul Taker**](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121011221659/yugioh/images/6/6d/SoulTaker-LCYW-EN-C-1E.jpg) in their hand. The non-turn player controls [**Botanical Girl**](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081101212224/yugioh/images/6/6a/BotanicalGirlCSOC-EN-C-1E.png).  
  
&gt;* Turn player activates **Soul Taker** targeting the opponent's **Botanical Girl**.  
&gt;  
&gt;*    The second effect of **Soul Taker** kicks in at the same time the effect of **Botanical Girl** would need to activate
&gt;  
&gt;* **Botanical Girl** ""**Misses the Timing**"" while the non-turn player gains a mandatory 1000 Life Points. 
   
As you can see
***  
Thanks for Reading! I hope you learned something new about what ""**Missing the Timing**"" actually means and how to deal with effects that do ""**Miss the Timing**"".

I made this a little while back for my personal use, people really seem to like it.

It has an auto-complete text box for you to enter the name of the card you want to search for (note: you don't have to use one of the suggested names if it's not working or what you want isn't there). You can also check/uncheck the Rarity boxes to get what you want. The second box is for you to add terms like Set ID or other rarities not listed.

The app performs an eBay search that only returns SOLD listings, you can click a link at the bottom and it will pull up the search in your own browser to see what results the app saw. Note: the eBay mobile site doesn't allow to search by only sold listings, so if your user agent can be changed to Desktop, that will help you to see exactly the results that the app got.

Anyways, I'd love to hear it. Thanks!

1362254098.0,19jc52,A Guide to Effectively using Backrow,Heyyosup,61,11,19,"As this guide was intended to be written for [here](http://www.neoseeker.com/forums/40362/t1836845-guide-to-effective-use-of-backrow/)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

**What is Backrow?**

Backrow is the array of set cards on your spell/trap zone, it is used to refer to Spell/Traps used to protect the player from threats. 
A subset of backrow, these traps are the backbone of standard competitive trap lineups, particularly due to how effective they are. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  
**Card Advantage Theory**

As Card Advantage is a highly comprehensive topic that would require its own guide in order to explain

I highly suggest you learn more about Card Advantage, I don't suggest skipping this section, as it offers a relatively indepth explanation on how this ties into effective uses of backrow. 
  
**What is Card Advantage?**

So what is the Card Advantage Theory? Card advantage is, simply having more resources than your opponent grants you a considerable advantage. For some odd reason, many novice players fail to realize that cards are resources, and that outresourcing your opponent grants you considerable advantage. 
  
**Types of Card Advantage**

Advantage in the minds of Yu-Gi-Oh players is how many more cards you control than your opponent. However, or who knows where. Although you could make some arbitrary system for those, the general consensus is that there are three types of Advantage calculated: Field Advantage, Hand Advantage and overall Advantage. As their names suggest, Field Advantage counts the number of cards on the field, hand advantage counts the number of cards in hand, and overall Advantage is the number of cards overall. 

Another common mistake of novices is to disregard Hand Advantage, a lot of the times, Hand Advantage is actually considered more important. Yu-Gi-Oh is a game with lots of mass-destruction cards that turn the game's flow around at the drop of a hat. However, generally, these mass-destruction cards do not affect the hand. As such, the hand is generally a safe haven for cards to remain to be used later on as responses to your opponent's plays. This idea of the hand being a safe haven will be explained in detail later on. 
  
**Calculation of Advantage via Plusses and Minuses**

This simple theory is further expanded into a system of plusses and minuses
These ""Plusses"" and ""Minuses"" will constantly be mentioned in this guide, the Overall Advantage is used, with the difference of how many more cards you had than your opponent before and after the card is played being the number used in the aforementioned notation. For example, playing ""Pot of Greed"" is a +1, as I lose one card, Pot of Greed itself, in order to draw two more cards

To novice players uninitiated with the impact of this concept
  
**Simplification and One-For-One Exchanges**

I think many players have previously been in a game where one side has no hand nor field, as winning is almost guaranteed. 

Along with being walls for defense, there is no reason to use defensive backrow that doesn't also contribute to this purpose of simplification. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  
**Playing**

With the general Theory-Oh! done
 
**The Protection and Conservation of Backrow**

Many times, many times, the opponent is granted an avenue to ""sack"" by the player's wasteful use of backrow, causing them to not have a response to their opponent when it really matters. 
In order to reduce the waste of backrow

**Don't stop trivial things if you can deal with it later on without using a trap:** 
In one of our games, he had a knee-jerk reaction and flipped his set trap card, wasting it in order to avoid a simple 1500 damage. Evidently, that was the only trap available for him, as he had no way of defending himself from my offensive push later in the game. 

**Be a man
A common mindset amoung new players is that difference in life point matters enough for the player to do whatever they can to avoid taking damage. This ties into my example above

**Avoid setting a large amount of backrow immediately:** 
As previously mentioned, I see players setting 4 trap cards, only to have it be wiped away by Heavy Storm or some other power card and leaving them without a hand. Of course, Starlight Road is a card that, if played and drawn, allows for an exception to this rule. However, I don't advise bluffing Starlight Road. Many players (especially novices who don't think far ahead) will continue to play Heavy Storm anyways.  

**Negate when the opponent invests
Of course, where you should negate the start in order to not be OTKed). However, negating when your opponent invests multiple cards into one card is an easy way to gain Card Advantage while simplifying the game state. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
**Deck Building**

With perfect playing
  
**Filtering Decaprecated Backrow**

There are a multitude of criteria for which traps should and should not be used. I may have missed a few of them

**Situationality:** 
""You can only activate this card when it is the 20th of April at 4:20 PM"" is obviously not a very good condition. Of course, there are many cards which are nearly as situational that novice players still use. Overall, the more general the conditions for the Trap are, the better. For that reason, Solemn Judgment is a popular card despite its hefty cost. 

**Effectiveness:** 
Even if a card meets all of the other criteria, and to punish your opponent for investing resources by making them minus. If the trap does not help the above goals, it may not be a good idea to use.  

**There are better alternatives:** 
Sakaretsu armor, it is completely outclassed by both Mirror Force and Dimensional Prison. An additional example is Trap Hole. It is outclassed by both Bottomless Trap Hole and Solemn Warning. Of course, many of these better alternatives are recognized by the general playerbase as better, which makes them a little pricier. Unless you plan on topping major tournaments, or play on DN, you only have to follow this one for as much as your wallet can deal with it.

**Card Advantage:** 
Although some OCG players may disagree with me on this point, which doesn't help with the goal of simplifying the game in your favor. 
  
**Meta Calls**

The most important factor of backrow to use for higher level play is the current direction of the metagame. Some traps may be rendered useless against the current metagame

A primary example of this are Mirror Force and Dimensional Prison: They were made completely useless and not to be used during the format where Inzektors were a formidable and common matchup. As such

Discretion is to be made for determining the direction of the metagame, as well as deserving its own guide, is often very abstract. As such, I can't write much about it. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

**Common Choices**

As the card pool of Yu-Gi-Oh! is massive
 
**Staples:**

* Solemn Judgment 
* Solemn Warning 
* Torrential Tribute 

These cards are mandatory in nearly every deck
 
**Preference cards:**

* Book of Moon 
* Bottomless Trap Hole 
* Compulsory Evacuation Device 
* Dimensional Prison 
* Fiendish Chain 
* Forbidden Lance 
* Mirror Force 

These cards are often used
 
**Starlight Road**

This card deserves special mention. It is useful for protecting large trap lineups, only one copy should be used. 
 
**OCG Cards**

* Raigeki Break 
* Phoenix Wind Blast 

Personally, and so deserve to be mentioned.

* Gravekeeper's - Very cheap and works very well against the all monsters meta we are in. You basically just sit behind your traps and constantly go plus with recruiter + Stele + (Wonder Wand)

Cards that can be added: Wonder Wand (x2), Mirror Force, Solemn Warning, Ect.

Basic Deck Skeleton: http://i.imgur.com/TfTL3vf.png

* Macro Rabbit - Not very cheap if you add Guaibas + Lances. But most of the decks in the meta use the graveyard a lot. Very good against the meta

Cards that can be added: Guaibas + Lances do VERY well and add A LOT to this deck. Also Lv. 4s in the extra deck, Shock Master, ECT. 

Basic Deck Skeleton: http://i.imgur.com/l0w8XPG.png

* Chaos Dragons - Again decently cheap but they use BLS and you can play without him you are fine.

What can be taken out: Traps

What can be put in: Solar Recharge

Basic Deck Skeleton: http://i.imgur.com/ewSdO2O.png

* Chaos Agents - Again very cheap can pick of three structure deck for about $25 but then you need things like tour guide, chaos sorc, BLS (Again can work without, but it helps the deck out tenfold.)  

Basic Deck Skeleton: http://i.imgur.com/AmF3IIV.png

* Six Samurai - I don't really know what to say about this because I have never played them and have no idea of the cost. If anyone can inform me of the cost

http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/17ujlw/so_you_just_got_back_into_the_game_and_want_a/c88zrkd

* Dark Worlds: Very cheap

Dark World Lightning and whatever the other one is that i out in l0l.

Basic Deck Skeleton: http://i.imgur.com/rhbVUEf.png

* Inzektors: Decently cheap

Basic Deck Skeleton: http://i.imgur.com/PAixw2d.png

* Chain Burn: INSANELY cheapr but you will most likely get flamed for running it.

The deck should look something like this: http://i.imgur.com/14zWT8l.png

* Lancer Frogs: Decently cheap

Basic Deck Skeleton: http://i.imgur.com/8KdAymP.png

* Machina Gadget: Very cheap

Basic Deck Skeleton: http://i.imgur.com/VDZALVz.png

Again I haven't played all of these decks so I don't know if I am missing things and also I am most likely missing a few decks.

I got lazy and stopped putting better and more expensive cards in the side. And cheap cards in extra.

Edit: Formating and added Inzektors.

When I was about 1 year old, and she was always there for me. If I ever had a bad day, I always knew that I had her happy, smiling face to come home to. She was everyone's favorite dog. She was family to us.

About 5 years ago, and was the same, happy, cheerful dog that she always was. Last year, the heart problems came back. The vet said that she didn't have much time left. Her personality never changed though, she continued to fetch for her toy, run up and down the stairs, on a December morning, not wanting to move. I took her to the vet with her in my lap. When we got to the vet, just like my parents had taught me all through my childhood that I spent with her by my side. I lost my best friend that day. ""Be like Fergy was

The other day when I was playing with my friend, and make my own alter of it http://imgur.com/X2x2tQ8 to remind me every day when I play, whatever situation that I may be in that would look grim, I can just remember what she did in a similar situation. She never gave up, and she never backed down. She *stayed strong*.

Thank you for reading this, just for Fergy.

Stay strong.

About halfway through the game, Sangan, and Tour Guide, plus a Torrential Tribute and an Infestation Pandemic Infection set. He has two backrow.

His turn, this was where I SHOULD have torrential'd, I was planning to chain Infection and get the Sangan eff for the +1, but my inexperience with Photons led me to believe he was going into Utopia or something.)

So he overlays into Photoknight Paladius, immediately detaching his two materials. I say ""hold on"" again, and he ignores me again, targeting Ophion with his effect. At this point I flip torrential. After about 15 seconds, he goes ""hello effect already activated, too late"".

I tell him that he went way too fast

The admin doesn't come for at LEAST 10 minutes, as if I'm supposed to decide whether or not to activate a trap card  before I even know what monster he's summoning, and my personal favorite: "" there are no manners in yugioh /  and I play by the rules, and I don;t have to ruleshark"".

Later on he pulls the ""I've been playing longer than you kid"" without me making any indication whatsoever of how long I've been playing (7+ years, at this point he just starts talking in circles leading me to believe he does this a lot, to take advantage of the lack of admins to get people to quit out of boredom.

The admin finally arrives, I didn't know admins could check duel logs). Admin says ""where was the summon?"" ""There was no summon"" and then asks me what happened.

I reiterate my story, you can bet I'd have been mad. Admin comes back and basically sides with me, and then says ""furthermore, because you told us a misleading statement and tried to cheat, you will receive a warning and a game loss"", but it gets better. After a couple minutes of the guy backpedaling the admin comes back and says ""I just found out this was a repeat offense, your warning has been upgraded to a ban, I win

__________________

&gt; **Look at the card**

Obvious first step. Most of the time the image of a fake card will be blurry. This is because the quality of the printers is significantly poorer than that of Konami. If you have poor eye-sight then you shouldn't worry. There are a lot of other ways to show that a card's fake.

__________________

&gt; **Check the set number**

All yugioh cards have a set number. This is located below the bottom-right of the image. An example would be Yata-Garasu. Its set number is LOD-000. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/Ks723.png) is where the set number is located. With this number

_______________

&gt;**Check the Font**

Konami has been consistent with the font they use on their cards since the day they began printing them. If you think that a card is fake, a lot  of fakers just can't get this one right. Be careful though, normal monster's text will always be italicized where as effect monster text is not.

____________________

&gt;**Check the copyright**

On the very bottom-right of the card next to the hologram square that we will get to in a second, fakes will not have this at all. Other fakes will misspell Kazuki Takahashi's name. If this is the case, then you have another fake.

_________________

&gt;**Check the hologram square**

Almost every player knows that a fake card does not have this little hologram square in the bottom-right corner of the card. If you hold it up to the light

_________________

&gt;**Check the back of the card**

[This](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081116222811/ycm/images/archive/e/e5/20091231183527!Back-EN.png) is what you should see. [This](http://images.wikia.com/ycm/images/d/da/Back-JP.png) is what you should see if your card is Japanese. If your card doesn't look like that then it's definitely 100% fake. This is again one of the easiest ways to spot a fake. A lot of them are blank. Other fakes have ""Yugioh"" written in the top-left corner. [Here](http://th02.deviantart.net/fs39/PRE/i/2008/329/8/0/Example_of_a_fake_Yugioh_card_by_Nick_Kazama.jpg) is a comparison of a real card and a fake card.


**NOTE** : The three effect-less Egyptian God Cards are the ONLY exception to this rule. When checking God cards for Legitimacy, the holofiol (which we'll get into later) and the rarity (ditto). The backs of the cards should be a normal blank yugioh card. The only difference is that Obelisk's back is blue, Ra's back is yellow, and Slifer's back is red. [Here](http://superhappycashcow.com/pic/YUGIOH/god-cards.jpg) is an example of 3 legitimate god cards. 
_________________

&gt;**Check the formatting**

Easy way to spot an English fake is the fact that it's formatted like the old Japanese cards. What I mean by this is the example of Gagagigo in the picture above. Notice how the attack and defense of the fake are inside of a box. That's pretty much how you can tell that it's fake. 

____________

&gt;**Check the rarity**

This method is becoming less-reliable due to the massive amount of reprints and upgrades Konami is giving out. If you have a suspected fake card

_______________

&gt;**Check the holofoil**

This is the best way to spot a fake holo yugioh card. Before I start with the more difficult ones

Other fake holofoils are also easy to spot if you know what to look for. This method only applies to supers, and ghost rares. Here's how Konami prints their cards: They take the cardstock and place the foil film over that. They then print the image over the holofoil film. For fakes, it's the reverse. They print the image onto a piece of cardstock. Then then cover that in cheap holofoil film. You'll notice that a fake card is usually very reflective. [Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R-RxxsSN_8&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=222s) an example of a fake holofoil card. 


__________

&gt;**Check the Name**

Obviously from that video you notice that Stardust Dragon's name clearly wasn't Stardust Dragon. This is pretty self-explanatory. If a card's name doesn't match the card then it's probably fake. There also is a very slight possibility that the card may be a production error which you can read about in my other thread: ""Do I have a Misprint?"" - A Simple Guide.

 ________________

&gt;**Spelling

This one's also very obvious. If you notice that a card's misspelling a lot of words or it's written in very poor English then it's safe to say that you have a fake. There are known errors in real yugioh cards that have misspelled words. Those can also be found in my other thread. Usually a real card will not have more than 1 card misspelled. If the grammar seems like it was translated with google, in very poor English.

_______________

&gt;**Exodia has never existed in 1 card**

Exodia Necross and Exodius do not count. 1-card Exodias do not exist in Yugioh. If you see one

_____________________

&gt;**How do I avoid buying fake cards?**

Fake cards aren't as prominent now as they were back in the mid 2000's but they still exist and there is still the risk of you getting a hold of them. I'll start off by telling you that you more than likely NEVER find fake cards at Walmart, and other large/chain stores. Your local hobby store isn't likely to carry fakes as no store wants that rumor going around. If your store is sanctioned then you have even less to worry about.

**PLACES TO AVOID**: Dollar stores, and Garage Sales.

While sometimes you'll find legitimate cards at the three places you'll notice that people will sell entire decks of fakes for a dollar. Unless you know how to spot real products then I'd recommend not buying. If a deal seems too good to be true

**Pre-Tournament** 

Prior to the tournament, but I was able to snag a 1st edition one from a player for a cool $20.

I had recently gotten into Infernities and was thinking about building the deck until I found a friend who had all the cards I needed, both cards the friend I traded to had with him. Infernities are also great, so although it may have been hard to part with the GKs, I'm now excited to finish a great competitive deck in Infernities. 

* NOT TO MENTION I also got a Starliege Paladynamo (my third overall) and a Constellar Omega in the trade

At this point

**Here is the exact deck I used for the tournament:**  http://i.imgur.com/tuEfBYr.png

The deck is a combination of /u/philythemaster Local Winning Deck ([HERE](http://imgur.com/a/3fXZX#0)) and his YCS Deck ([HERE](http://imgur.com/a/SHegk#0)). The most notable changes are the non-mained Macro Cosmos (sided 3 copies) and the addition of a single Recycling Batteries. 

At my locals, and the Recycling Batteries allowed me to do that. For example, I could summon Mahunder, summon a Watt, XYZ into Starliege Paladynamo, use it's effect and detach two materials, and then Recycling Batteries them back into my hand. The one mained copy helped a ton.

**Round 1 - Macro Rabbit**

* Game 1: The same guy playing the Rabbit deck I played last time at locals, basically to feel my opponent out and have them waste MST/Heavy Storm). He eventually made Dolkka, negated my two Sea Horses over the course of two turns, but I had sufficient stall to keep him at bay while the Watts poked around. **WIN**

* Game 2: Opened two Swords of Revealing Light, so I stalled with Roar and Swords until some Watts came to poke around. He summoned a Guaiba and was visibly frustrated in BOTH of our decks, and XYZ'ed into Utopia to keep me at bay. I got three Watts on the field, attacked with two which were promptly negated by Utopia, then attacked his Utopia with Wattgiraffe, replayed the attack and attacked directly, and during MP2 went into Gagaga Cowboy for game. **WIN**

1-0

**Round 2 - Karakuri**

* Game 1: I was told by my opponent this wasn't the infamous Desmond Johnson Psychic Stun variation, and Naturia Beast, the four Spell cards in my hand did nothing to help me, and it was quick after that. **LOSS**

* Game 2: Opened the usual Threatening Roar in hand, but I summoned Wattpheasant in my next turn, attacked directly, banished the Beast, and played a Messenger of Peace to protect myself. He couldn't come back after that. **WIN**

* Game 3: Woo, along with some stall. He opened the usual spammy cards, oh, and a ROYAL DECREE. Thankfully the sided in copies of Messenger of Peace helped to alleviate that. At some point, however, he got out a Scrap Dragon and started blowing cards up, but I was able to go into Starliege Paladynamo to make his Scrap Dragon useless. Brought out Mahunder and Giraffe, dropped him to 800 Life Points

2-0

**Round 3 - Crystal Beasts**

I don't know how CBs made it this far. No one expected it

* Game 1: I don't know what Crystal Beast cards do

* Game 2: Lava Golem made a big appearance

3-0

**SEMIFINALS**

**Round 4 - Chaos**

* Game 1: He mistakenly summoned Gorz after a direct attack

* Game 2: After activating Swords of Revealing Light and setting a Threatening Roar just in case, I set three cards and summoned Wattcobra, attacked, added another Wattcobra, and maintained backrow presence while continuously dropping more Wattcobras and drawing more backrow. **WIN**

4-0

**FINAL ROUND**

Watts **vs.** Prophecy

The one person at locals that runs Prophecy

* Round 1: He opened only what I can assume to be broken

* Round 2: I didn't know a deck I thought was so good (Prophecy) could open so bad. He told me how much he hated his initial hand, added Master, and on his End Phase used Justice's effect, banished and added an HPOP along with another Spellbook card. The Mind Crush I had set dropped not only the HPOP he added in hand, but a second one he had also! Wattgiraffe came in and poked around, and he never had an answer to it. **WIN**

* Game 3: He again was physically demoralized at his opening hand. He set a monster and passed. I set a Solemn Warning and Roar, I summoned Wattcobra and started to bring it down. He summoned Justice, only to get it Compulsed, and I continued to bring out more Watts to drive it home. He again tried to summon Justice only to have me play Fiendish Chain and leave it dead. **Summon. Stun. Win.**

And that was it. I went 5-0 and won with Watts. Players talked about how deceptive it was

I love how the deck ran

MVP Card of the Day: **Wattgiraffe** - Without it, and I tended to draw into it enough to stick my opponents for some good damage.

Hope you enjoyed the report!

1362123956.0,19gaoa,How the hell did you beat me with only 1 star normal monsters? A guide to 1 Star Normal Monster OTK,puffnstuff272,60,15,28," This deck was a well received post I did a while back so I thought to write it up while deck guides are hot. 

 Pros: 
You can make this deck for less than 5$ IRL no problem
Humiliate your opponent
Feel like the greatest underdog that ever lived

Cons:
You are playing with a deck that is mostly 1 star normal monsters

The deck:

20-22: 1 Star Normal monsters

High Defense is the best (Bunilla, Oppressed People, Oppressed People, Water Spirit) 

3:Heart of the Underdog

During your draw phase
This makes you draw an absurd amount

1:Ultimate offering

Flooding the field with your little bastards.

3: Enchanting Fitting Room

This card allows you draw the top 4 cards of your deck and special summon any normal monsters among them

3:Triangle Power

This card gives all 1 star normal monster 2000 attack. 

3:Law of the Normal

You activate this card when you have 5 face up level 1 monsters on the field. You and your opponent get rid of everything on the field and in your hands. This is what leaves your opponent open for the OTK.




So here's a rundown of how the OTK works.

Step 1: Get 5 1 Star Normal monsters on the field. (by combination of ultimate offering/EFR)

Step2: Active Triangle Power Making them all Beat sticks.

Step3: Active Law of the Normal and Leave your opponent Speechless.

Step3: Attack for game and drink your opponents Tears.




Note: The last 8-10 cards of the deck are your choosing. I'd advise with anything and everything you can think to stall your opponent with. Solemn's

1362010548.0,19d24g,Down with the Sickness - a guide to Evilswarms,TheArkiteckt,55,3,40,"Hey everyone! In lieu of all of these awesome guides for archetype and sub-archetype decks
    
**Preface - Evilswarms and the Lore behind them**    

The Evilswarms (Verz in OCG) are a new archetype that is being released into Yugioh TCG on April 19th via Hidden Arsenal 7: Knights of Stars. The corrupted beasts are all perverted forms of past and present Duel Terminal archetype monsters that have been infected with the 'lswarm' virus. The monsters and support cards focus on controlling the pace of the game as well as limiting the plays your opponent can make and all the while methodically winning the duel.    

    

**1.0 Heart of the Swarm** 

* This is the core of most
    
__________________________________________________________        
**1.1 The Monsters**

* *1.1.1 The Evilswarms*

* **Evilswarm Heliotrope:** A vanilla 1950 beater that just happens to be 50 ATK higher than Thunder King Rai-Oh. More importantly

* **Evilswarm Castor:** At a respectable 1750 ATK, **Fiendish Chain**, **Breakthrough Skill**, **Herald of Orange Light**, or **Forbidden Chalice**. **RUN: 3**

* **Evilswarm Kerykeion:** Kerykeion shares the same effect with it's counterpart, then target another in the grave and return it to your hand. And if you use this effect you get another **Normal Summon** during the turn you used his effect. Perfect for grave manipulation and quick rank 4 XYZ summoning. Kerykeion does have a third effect that will never be used in this build sense you won't be running lvl 5 Evilswarms. **RUN: 3**

*  **Evilswarm Mandragora:** Lvl 4 monster that has the ability to be special summoned from your hand if your opponent controls more monsters than you. If you're lacking a **Rescue Rabbit** or **Evilswarm Castor** in hand

* **Evilswarm Thunderbird:** Lvl 4 monster that has the unique ability of banishing itself when any effect, therefor it can't be Solemned, Torrentialed, and it's a great way to get around a Thunder King Rai-Oh. **RUN: 3**    

* 1.1.2 *The Other Monsters*

* **Dark Armed Dragon:** Works great with Evilswarms. Generally

* **Effect Veiler:** Some people like to main Veiler and some don't. It's usually a matter of player preference. I'd contend in an Evilswarm deck that it shouldn't be preference, and then lock down the field with Ophion, you might run into some people who might want to get rid of him (sarcasm). Thankfully, Ophion can search out his own protection against spells and traps, but what about monster effects? Well, Veiler solves that issue pretty well. More on Ophion later. **RUN: 2**

* **Rescue Rabbit:** As if the Evilswarm Castor engine to get out quick Rank 4 XYZ monsters wasn't enough, Rabbit just adds to the consistency. Running another playset of vanillas would leave the deck too clogged up. There's also a certain trap you can run specific to the Evilswarm archetype that can help with hands that include 2x Heliotrope and a rabbit. **RUN: 2**

___________________________________________________________

**1.2 The Spells**

* *1.2.1 Archetype Spell*

* **Infestation Pandemic:** Quite possibly the most important card in your entire deck. Ophion's effect allows this to be searched from your deck and then put into your hand. It works just like Forbidden Lance

*1.2.2 Staple Spells*

* **Allure of Darkness:** Pretty self explanatory. Draw two

* **Heavy Storm:** Clears that heavy backrow so Ophion or the like can be summoned unhindered. Be weary of **Starlight Road**! **RUN: 1**

* **Monster Reborn:** A zero cost card that allows you to bring almost any monster from either players graveyard back to your side of the field is just too good to not run. **RUN: 1**

* **Mystical Space Typhoon:** The younger brother to Heavy Storm. Needs no real explanation. Watch out for **Abyss-Sphere**! **RUN: 2 - 3**

* **Reinforcement of the Army:** Allows you to search for Evilswarm Castor

*1.2.3 Spell Tech Options/Personal Flair*

* **Forbidden Dress:** With your own archetype specific Forbidden Lance on steroids, which could save your Ophion from an attack from a bigger beater. **RUN: 2**

* **Forbidden Lance:** With **Infestation Pandemic**

* **Pot of Avarice:** With 2x Rabbits and only one playset of vanillas

* **Pot of Duality:** Duality is nice in the fact that you get your choice of the top 3 cards in your deck

* **Dark Hole:** WHAT? A STAPLE YOU SAY? Well, it has its uses like chaining a Pandemic to it's activation, clearing your opponent's field and not yours. Figure out where you want it. **RUN: 1**

* **Creeping Darkness:** Has the potential to work in this build

* **Dark Mambele:** A nice card

___________________________________________________________

**1.3 The Traps**

* *1.3.1 Archetype Traps*

* **Infestation Infection:** The only archetype trap you'll be running. Fairly straightfoward effect, so even if your trap is solemn'd you would still have to shuffle an Evilswarm monster back into your deck. This could work for and against you in some cases. **RUN: 1**

* *1.3.2 Staple Traps*

* **Solemn Judgment:** Big daddy himself. Can stop virtually everything except monster effects. Obviously be wary of using this as it takes away half of your LP. **RUN: 1**

* **Solemn Warning:** Can stop summons and effects from monsters/spells/traps that summon monsters. It's only at one now so use it wisely! **RUN: 1**

* **Compulsory Evacuation Device:** Some may argue that this isn't considered a staple, Synchros, and Fusions back to the extra deck. In some cases, using on your own monster can prove to be beneficial as well! **RUN: 2 - 3**

* **Torrential Tribute:** Another trap thats staple status is debatable in some decks. It works so well with Evilswarms that I'd almost always recommend maining it. A common combo is to **chain Infestation Pandemic** to the activation of your own TT during either either players turn

*1.3.3. Trap Tech Options/Personal Flair*

* **Fiendish Chain:** One of my absolute favorite traps. Stops an effect monster dead in their tracks. I find it to be extremely versatile because unlike Veiler or **Breakthrough Skill**

* **Starlight Road/The Huge Revolution is Over:** The general uses for these two traps are very similar. If you can make room in your extra deck for a Stardust Dragon, Revolution **banishes** the card it was chained to. Judgement Dragon would be a great target for Revolution. Make them pay 1000, then banish their beloved dragon. These should be seeing even more use come March 1st due to the loss of a Solemn Warning and the likely addition of cards like Torrential Tribute. **RUN: 1**

* **Bottomless Trap Hole:** Some consider it a staple in decks

* **Dimensional Prison:** Able to banish just like Bottomless

* **Mirror Force:** Same principle as D-Prison. Don't give your opponent an inch to breathe with this deck and you won't need Mirrors. It does have its uses against decks that like to swarm with lower leveled monsters and then attack. **RUN: 1 - 2**

* **Deck Devastation/Eradicator Epidemic Virus:** Bahamut, while Eradicator would be amazing against Prophecy. It's really personal choice of what you think you'll see more often. **RUN: 1 - 2**

* **Mind Crush:** Amazing against any deck that searches for cards. It's generally a good draw at any point in the game unless in dire situations. Recoil effect of having to discard one of your cards for declaring something not in your opponent's hand. **RUN: 2 - 3**

* **Safe Zone:** The only reason you'd want to run Safe Zone is to further protect your Ophion while he's on the field. It won't allow him to attack directly

___________________________________________________________

**1.4 The Extra Deck**

* *1.4.1 Synchros*

* **Stardust Dragon:** Only work him into your extra deck if you plan on maining a Starlight Road. His effect should be well known enough for me to not go into detail. If Otphion is on the field

* *1.4.2 XYZ Must Haves*

* **Evilswarm Ophion:** The **MVP** of the deck. The entire point of almost any Evilswarm build is to get him out. The ease at which you can get him out is a scary fact. Using only 2 Level 4 Evilswarms will have you controlling the field in no time. Search Pandemic out from the deck using his effect

* **Evilswarm Bahamut:** The better Big Eye! You won't always go for this card, to discard one of your Evilswarm monsters, and then take control of an opponent's monster. Bahamut is great for mirror matches as well. Your opponent summoned and Ophion of his own? No problem, overlay into Bahamut and use his Ophion for yourself. A bit of an underwhelming attack at 2350 though, so watch out! **RUN: 2**

* **Evilswarm Ouroboros:** The boss monster of the Evilswarms. It takes 3 level 4 monsters to make this badboy. His effects aren't as generally devastating as Ophion's, send a target in their graveyard to the banish pile, or discard 1 random card in their hand. Each effect can only be used once while Ouroboros is on the field. Choose wisely! RUN: 1 -2 

* *1.4.3 XYZ Rank 4 Staples*

* I won't go into much description on the rest of an Evilswarm extra deck, Bahamut, and Ourboros. Feel free to throw in staples such as **Utopia**, **Maestroke**, **Excalibur** (Castor is a warrior!), **Blackship of Corn**, **Photon Papilloperative**, **Lavaval Chain**

___________________________________________________________

**1.5 Side Deck Options**

These are all situational. Please include more options for a side deck in the comments. Side in to counter what you see the most at your locals

* **Thunder King Rai-Oh:** His stock has gone up even more since Prophecy is on the rage. A 1900 beater with not 1 but 2 amazing effects? Yes

* **Puppet Plant:** Great for the Prophecy matchup as well as Six Sams as you can take control of a warrior monster as well. That Shi-En or Priestess will look nice on your side of the field for a turn.

* **Dimensional Fissure/Macro Cosmos:** Surprisingly easy to tech into the Evilswarm build. Just side out your Veiler

* **Chaos Counter:** I've personally never tried running Chaos Counters with Evilswarms

* **Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning:** An odd tech choice for most

* **Gozen Match:** Dark attributes take up the vast majority of your monster pool

* **D.D. Crow:** It's been said recently that D.D. Crow will be a lot more useful this format

* **Maxx ""C"":** This cards stock may go down in the March format. Still very effective vs. Wind Ups and Six Sams.

* **Soul Drain:** Will not hinder any card you run in the least

* **Needle Ceiling:** Such a good card against Wind Ups and Six Sams. 

* **Overworked:** Great for the Firefist matchup

* **Light-Imprisoning Mirror:** With Lyla back at 3
 
* **Poisonous Winds:** With Harpies on the rise and Blackwings getting Kalut to 3 and an amazing level 4 XYZ monster (Sylphine

___________________________________________________________

**2.0 How the Deck Plays &amp; Basic Strategy**

* To be completely honest

* Always leave an overlay unit attached to Ophion. Without an overlay unit

* Play conservatively. This deck is not meant to be an aggressor. Your strategy should be to methodically take away the resources your opponent has at his/her disposal, take your opponent for game using cards like Bahamut, Excalibur, or Gagaga Cowboy.

* Finally

___________________________________________________________

**3.0 Basic Combos**

* First turn opening hand: Rescue Rabbit

&gt;Normal Summon Rescue Rabbit  
  
&gt;Activate Rescue Rabbit's effect
 
&gt;SS from deck Evilswarm Heliotrope 2x 
   
&gt;Overlay 2x Heliotrope for Evilswarm Ophion  
  
&gt;Detach overlay unit to search deck for Pandemic   
 
&gt;Set Pandemic and Fiendish Chain
    
&gt;End Turn    

* Opponent has 1 set S/T and 1 set monster on field. Your hand is Evilswarm Castor

&gt;Normal Summon Evilswarm Castor

&gt;Using Castor effect

&gt;Opponent chains Kerykeion summon with a facedown Torrential Tribute

&gt;You chain Infestation Pandemic from your hand to your opponent's Torrential Tribute

&gt;Activate Kerykeion effect

&gt;Banish E.swarm Mandragora and return Helitrope from grave to hand

&gt;Using Kerykeoin's effect

&gt;Overlay all 3 monsters to SS Evilswarm Ouroboros from your Extra Deck

&gt;Detach a unit to target one random card in your opponent's hand and send it to the grave

&gt;Attack Directly for 2750

&gt;End Turn

___________________________________________________________

**4.0 Evilswarm Weaknesses**

* **Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror:** This has the potential to shut down your deck completely.

* **Rivalry of the Warlords:** Evilswarms may share the same attribute, Bahamut, and Ouroboros are dragons.

* **Decks that Normal Summon instead of Special Summon:** Hazy Beasts instantly come to mind.

* **Decks that run low level monsters:** Inzektors

* **Skill Drain:** Not many decks can main it

**The Deck**
I brought Chaos Dragons to this tournament. This was 25% meta-call

My main deck is constructed in such a way that it provides significant game 1 advantage vs Wind-Ups (which I did not play) and Geargia (I played 2); and for that it suffers heavily against decks like DW and Heroes. I main 3 Effect Veiler and 2 Maxx ""C"". The game plan against these decks is to try to get mill off and draw as few hand traps as possible

**The Tourney**

Round 1: Geargias (2-1 Win)

Game 1: 

I had never seen this player before

Game 2: 

At this point I'm wondering if I've just been trolled into complacency (which is a mistake no matter who you play) and decide to side into my Cybers and Electric Viruses. I quickly realize he wasn't joking when he tries to Pot of Avarice spells/traps and Duality after Special Summoning. I draw a lot better this game and can get mill off; he has plenty of backrow but after powering through it I just kept poking with Lightpulsar with the soft-lock (REDMD+Lightpulsar) on board for game.

Game 3:

He swarms the board turn 1, and a Geargiaccelerator - Maxx ""C"" was chained to the Armor effect so he stopped after specialing accelerator. Cyber Dragon is specialed, a 4k Chimeratech comes out, and he is OTKed. I try to give him as many tips as I can (the most basic being not to swarm the board without protection) seeing as I don't know his deck very well and continue on my way.



**Round 2: Geargia (2-1 Win)**

Game 1:

This game is against one of the area's stronger players. I knew from a previous tournament he was running the Karakuri variant so I knew I had to go off ASAP or else I would be OTKed. I lost the dice roll and draw mediocre; I opened with a Lyla and Recharge which is usually quite good but I draw into hand traps and mill Heavy and Reborn. The game goes quite slow, and Lightpulsar in hand and he's beat down.

Game 2:

I side into the same as the last Geargia match along with one additional tech card. He starts with a set, and pass with Gorz in hand. I have no hand traps to save me and he senses this when his Armor effect goes through so he attempts to go off, however his hand was not the best so he only ends up with a Karakuri Dog and Burei on board; I decide not to drop Gorz on the dog to preserve my LP (this would prove to be a mistake). The next turn I E-Virus both of his monsters and go off in an attempt to OTK; I vomit my hand onto the board and into the grave (pitching Gorz for a Lightpulsar); the push is stopped at the last second with a very well-timed D.D. Crow targeting the Lightpulsar REDMD was reviving.

He lives with 100 LP after my push. His Burei is returned to him (I used the dog to Tribute Summon) and I have no cards in hand; he destroys REDMD with Burei and Monster Reborns it. I have literally zero outs to my own REDMD. I top-deck into Tour Guide

Game 3:

I draw into the card I teched into the side; depending on how this card worked it could win me the game. I get my mill going


**Round 3: Atlanteans (2-1 Win)** 

Game 1:

I immediately remember this player; I played him on the bubble of Sunday's tournament (prizes being GGX, crushing me. I resolve to myself for that not to happen again before the match. Other than that there's not much to say about this game; he can't really establish presence and I beat him down with LP pokes turn after turn.

Game 2:

Much like the last game there wasn't really anything notable about this one. I draw fairly bad and keep passing until he establishes enough of his pieces to go off and leave me unable to come back.

Game 3:

He sits on a Level Limit Area for quite a while. I eventually draw into DDV and set it


**Round 4: Heroes (0-2 Loss)**

Game 1:

I can't really establish board presence and the game becomes Alius beatdown. He has answers to everything I do and my hand is full of dead draws - hand traps are nearly useless against this deck. I had hoped not to play this deck due to their dwindling popularity but it was not the case. I lost this game 1900 at a time.

Game 2:

I draw nothing turn 1 and pass. He normals Fossil Dyna and suddenly my entire hand becomes completely dead. I was counting on a Gorz drop to sit on as I had no milling outlets. I topdeck Card Trooper and thank my luck until I mill 2 Lights and a Spell; its fine though because now the Fossil Dyna dies. The next turn he summons another and neither of the two draws I get from trooper+turn draw can help me


I was expecting this to happen should I play Heroes or DW; I consciously built my deck weak against those decks due to their low popularity here. It happens.


**Top 8: Six Samurais (2-1 Win)**

Game 1:

First turn Nat Beast with a Reborn in hand fucks me. I only have so many mill outlets and answers to one naturia beast

Game 2:

The Naturia Beast shows its face once again

Game 3:

This game started out horrible. When I drew my 6th card I was already staring down a Naturia Beast, milling a Light and a Dark, which is what I perfectly needed to start going off. I dropped Trag on the Grandmaster's attack and he had no response - Trag was at 3k and the lack of a response tells me he has no Warning. He makes a crazy play in his MP2 that instantly tells me both his backrow are bluffs - he synchro summons Shi-En and overlays Shi-En and Grandmaster for Adreus in order to destroy Tragoedia.

I decide to simply spam out my hand knowing that both backrow were useless. Darkflare is summoned to start dumping out Lights/Darks


**Top 4: Heroes (2-0 Win)**

Game 1:

This is the same Hero player that beat me 0-2 in Swiss. In the first few turns it seems to be the same situation as our first games; Thunder King is beating me down and I have no answers. Eventually I'm able to mount a come back; Royal Decree is flipped on his end phase and Card Trooper crashes into his TKing. With the mills I get (along with some Recharges in hand) I'm able to go off and kill him without fear of traps.

Game 2:

There isn't really much to say about this game. Sadly he didn't draw a single monster and Decree meant he couldn't stay in the game for long. I drew fairly bad too but I at least was able to get a Card Trooper out and keep poking down at him. I always felt these types of hands were the problem with Heroes; its entirely possible to simply die straight-out to a lowly Card Trooper because you have no answers.


I saw that the other top 4 match was Heroes vs Hieratic; I would much rather face the Hieratic due to my plethora of hand-traps. Lo and behold, and as the time was creeping close to midnight and I hated the matchup I obliged.


Overall, but I'll talk about that once the time comes.

----------------------------------

Here is a compilation post taken from other threads

**So what exactly has changed?**

**In 2008

""During your Main Phase 1 or 2

In order to Synchro Summon a Synchro Monster from your Extra Deck (under normal conditions)

Example of a synchro monster: http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Stardust_Dragon

**In 2011

Xyz Summons can be conducted when there are two or more monsters of the same Level on your side of the field. Those monsters can be used as Xyz Materials to Summon an Xyz Monster whose Rank is the same as the Levels of the monsters used.

In order to Xyz Summon an Xyz Monster, and placed on top of the stack.

Xyz Materials are not sent to the Graveyard. Instead

The respective battle positions of the Xyz Materials do not matter, ensure that the entire stack is neatly aligned in face-up attack position, regardless of whether or not the Xyz Monster is summoned in face-up ATK or DEF position.

An Xyz Summon is a type of Special Summon

Some effects may require you to remove Xyz Materials from an Xyz Monster. In this case

Note that an Xyz Monster Special Summoned via any means other than an Xyz Summon (except for Xyz Reborn) will not have any Xyz Materials beneath it. Therefore

If an Xyz Monster is flipped face-down

If a card that would banish cards sent to the graveyard (such as ""Macro Cosmos"" or ""Banisher of the Radiance"") is in effect

Example of an XYZ Monster: http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Number_39%3A_Utopia

**The Forbidden/Semi-Limited/Limited cards are everchanging:**

The elusive Black Luster Soldier: Envoy of the Beginning has gone from being Banned to Limited!

-----------------------------

Now onto deck construction

courtesy of dan_n:

**Staples**

Many decks nowadays run:  

Monsters:  
2/3 Effect Veiler
Card Car D
Maxx C

Spells:  
1 Book of Moon  
1 Dark Hole  
1 Heavy Storm  
1 Monster Reborn  
2/3 Mystical Space Typhoon

Traps:  
1 Solemn Judgment  
1 Solemn Warning  
2 Torrential Tribute

Other notable

* Compulsory Evacuation Device
* Bottomless Trap Hole
* Fiendish Chain
* Safe Zone
* Mirror Force
* Dimensional Prison

Other card that work well in many decks are **Cardcar D (questionable)** and **Gorz


**Meta**  

The current meta consists mainly of E. Dragon, Evilswarm, and Fire Fist (Tempest Dragunity floats around sometimes)

Other good

* Agents 
* Dark World (Structure deck released October 18
* Gravekeeper's (Just cheap overall
* Hero variants (Bubblebeat/Arrive Hero) 
* Lightsworn variants (lots of re-releases in recent packs) 
* Six Samurai (Structure deck released on June 26
* Machina Gadgets
* Gladiator Beast
* Dino Rabbits (key pieces released in 2012 Tins (Evolzar's
* Madolche


Upcoming decks/archetypes that will make a splash (cards from the upcoming Judgment of the Light and Shadow Specters set)

* Bujin
* BEWD (new structure deck coming)
* Monarchs (new cards 

 -

**Extra Deck**

Current decks run mostly Xyz monsters. Some decks still run Synchro monsters. Here is a list of some of the most popular generic cards

Rank 2

* Gachi Gachi Gantetsu
* Daigusto Phoenix (thanks metallicrooster!)

Rank 3:  

* Leviair
* Number 17: Leviathan Dragon  
* Number 20: Giga-Brilliant  
* Number 30: Acid Golem of Destruction  
* Wind-Up Zenmaines
* Temtempo the Percussion Djinn

Rank 4:
  
* Daigusto Emeral (HA07)
* Maestroke the Symphony Djinn  
* Number 39
* Number C39
* Steelswarm Roach  
* Lavalval Chain (HA07)
* Number 16 Shock Master
* Photon Papilloperative
* Number 50: Blackship of Corn
* Gagaga Cowboy
* Abyss Dweller

Rank 5:  

* Adreus
* Number 61: Volcasaurus 
* Tiras
* Wind-Up Arsenal Zenmaioh  

Rank 6:

* Photon Strike Bounzer

Synchros:

* Stardust Dragon
* Black Rose Dragon
* Ally of Justice Catastor


When making your Extra Deck, and **Blade Armor Ninja** and **Heroic Champion Excalibur** in any deck that includes a variety of Level 4 Warrior monsters.

It is a good idea to include a few good synchro monsters such as **Ally of Justice Catastor**, **Black Rose Dragon**,  **Stardust Dragon**, and **Mist Wurm**, even if your deck isn't focused on synchro summons; at times you may find performing one with **Effect Veiler** or a Reborned Tuner monster may win you the game or give you an upper hand.

 -

**Side Deck** (side decks are always changing with meta. Some of these are to deal with today's meta decks)

* Dimensional Fissure
* Dimensional Prison
* Dust Tornado
* Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer
* Maxx ""C""
* Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror
* Snowman Eater
* Soul Taker
* D.D. Crow
* Puppet Plant
* Gozen Match
* Rivalry of Warlords
* Light Imprisoning Mirror (from here down taken from LimeWasted. Thanks!)
* Nobleman of Crossout
* Snowman Eater
* System Down
* T-King Rai Oh

So, and Black Garden. A crazy combo I'd never seen before. I saw a comment in the best god card thread about Slifer and Black Garden, but how to get him out? That's where the air force came in. Since Mecha Phantom Beasts are so token-based, Black Garden actually helps them a lot. The instant my opponent summons a monster, Black Garden will protect my planes, if they haven't done that already.

With all the tokens and planes flying around, and I can summon Slifer the normal way. No pesky Ophion in my way. Then the fun begins. Because now the game shifts to Slifer. Now, unless my opponent pulls a magic Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon out of nowhere, Black Garden will cut it down to under 2000, where Slifer will destroy it, and I'll get another token for my planes. Then, I rain hell from the skys.

*************************

Here is a compilation post taken from other threads

**So what exactly has changed?**

**In 2008

""During your Main Phase 1 or 2

In order to Synchro Summon a Synchro Monster from your Extra Deck (under normal conditions)

Example of a synchro monster: http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Stardust_Dragon

**In 2011

Xyz Summons can be conducted when there are two or more monsters of the same Level on your side of the field. Those monsters can be used as Xyz Materials to Summon an Xyz Monster whose Rank is the same as the Levels of the monsters used.

In order to Xyz Summon an Xyz Monster, and placed on top of the stack.

Xyz Materials are not sent to the Graveyard. Instead

The respective battle positions of the Xyz Materials do not matter, ensure that the entire stack is neatly aligned in face-up attack position, regardless of whether or not the Xyz Monster is summoned in face-up ATK or DEF position.

An Xyz Summon is a type of Special Summon

Some effects may require you to remove Xyz Materials from an Xyz Monster. In this case

Note that an Xyz Monster Special Summoned via any means other than an Xyz Summon (except for Xyz Reborn) will not have any Xyz Materials beneath it. Therefore

If an Xyz Monster is flipped face-down

If a card that would banish cards sent to the graveyard (such as ""Macro Cosmos"" or ""Banisher of the Radiance"") is in effect

Example of an XYZ Monster: http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Number_39%3A_Utopia

**The Forbidden/Semi-Limited/Limited cards are everchanging:**

http://www.yugioh-card.com/en/limited/ (Updated 3/1 by Konami)

The elusive Black Luster Soldier: Envoy of the Beginning has gone from being Banned to Limited!

-----------------------------

Now onto deck construction

courtesy of dan_n:

**Staples**

Many decks nowadays run:

**Meta**  

The current meta consists mainly of the following decks set in different tiers. These are the most competitive decks today and will cost you quite a bit of money to make a complete deck (main/side/extra):

Tier 1: E. Dragon

Tier 1.5: Evilswarm

Tier 2: Tempest Dragunity

Other good

* Agents 
* Gravekeepers
* Dark World (Structure deck released October 18
* Hero variants (Bubblebeat/Arrive Hero) 
* Lightsworns
* Six Samurai (Structure deck released on June 26
* Machina Gadgets
* Dino Rabbits (key pieces released in 2012 Tins (Evolzar's
* Madolche
* Chaos Dragons
* Constellars 
* Fire Fist
* Infernity
* Battlin Boxers
* Karakuri
* Chain Burn
* Frog Monarchs
* Blackwings
* Hieratics


Upcoming decks/archetypes that will make a splash (cards from the upcoming Judgment of the Light and Shadow Specters set)

* Bujin
* BEWD (new structure deck coming)
* Monarchs (new support coming soon)
* Ghostricks
* Archfiends
* Vampires

 -

**Extra Deck**

Current decks run mostly Xyz monsters. Some decks still run Synchro monsters. Here is a list of some of the most popular generic cards

Rank 2

* Gachi Gachi Gantetsu
* Daigusto Phoenix 

Rank 3:  

* Leviair
* Number 17: Leviathan Dragon  
* Number 20: Giga-Brilliant  
* Number 30: Acid Golem of Destruction  
* Wind-Up Zenmaines
* Temtempo the Percussion Djinn

Rank 4:
  
* Daigusto Emeral 
* Maestroke the Symphony Djinn  
* Number 39
* Number C39
* Steelswarm Roach  
* Lavalval Chain 
* Number 16 Shock Master
* Photon Papilloperative
* Number 50: Blackship of Corn
* Gagaga Cowboy
* Abyss Dweller

Rank 5:  

* Adreus
* Number 61: Volcasaurus 
* Tiras
* Wind-Up Arsenal Zenmaioh  

Rank 6:

* Photon Strike Bounzer
* Constellar Ptolemys M7
* Gauntlet Launcher

Rank 7:

* Number 11: Big Eye
* Gaia Dragon
* Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack

Synchros:

* Stardust Dragon
* Black Rose Dragon
* Ally of Justice Catastor
* Crimson Blader


When making your Extra Deck, and **Blade Armor Ninja** and **Heroic Champion Excalibur** in any deck that includes a variety of Level 4 Warrior monsters.

It is a good idea to include a few good synchro monsters such as **Ally of Justice Catastor**,  **Stardust Dragon**, and **Mist Wurm**, even if your deck isn't focused on synchro summons; at times you may find performing one with **Effect Veiler** or a Reborned Tuner monster may win you the game or give you an upper hand.

* Dimensional Fissure
* Dust Tornado
* Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer
* Maxx ""C""

* Puppet Plant
* Electric Virus

**Side Deck**

To be decided :'(

------------------------------

I like Ritual monsters and I love Fusion monsters

This deck does all of the typical Gem-Knight stuff; which is to say drop a whole lot of fusion monsters and drop your entire hand doing so.  The first part I really enjoy the second part I really don't.  So I tried to circumvent this by including cards that aided me in fixing my hand while also taking advantage of all the normal monsters I have to run.  

Now **Gem-Knight Fusion** is already an incredibly abusive card for the archetype.  By including **Reshef the Dark Being** I've taken that abuse to criminal levels by turning it into a **Change of Heart** as well.

I've come across times where I do have completely dead hands  but I think that's more my luck (open 6 normal Gem-Knights draw two more and then **Rescue Rabbit**).  I'm looking to fix this through a slight change in tech

I'm still trying to work on side deck choices I best think would help so I haven't included that in this deck profile.

I love that the three orbs **Reshef the Dark Being** holds match the colors of **Gem-Knight Sapphire**,,False,self,t5_2rpe6,False,,True

A lot of them seem very basic but newer players especially have trouble grasping some of them. Feel free to share any rulings that frequently come up in your games!

- If you set a quickplay spell you cannot activate it until your opponents turn

- If you respond to an attack declaration with Threatening Roar the attack still goes through since it has already been declared. Also

- If you chain Forbidden Dress to Dimensional Prison

- If Heavy Storm (or any other mass destruction card) is destroyed before an activated Starlight Road resolves

- Only counter traps or spell speed 2 cards/effects that alter attack/defense or negate card/effect activations can be activated in the damage step (unless specifically stated ie: Gorz)

- Solemn Warning cannot be used on Geartown at any time (spell activation or activation of it's effect when it is destroyed)

- Starlight Road cannot be chained to the effect of Elemental Hero Stratos or similar effects

- Monsters who have *optional* effects that activate *when* they are summoned will not get their effects if you chain Call of the Haunted targeting them to an opponent's Mystical Space Typhoon due to missing the timing",self,t5_2rpe6,1363638792.0,,wind,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1ajc3n/just_some_rulings_not_everyone_seems_to_know/

1330634956.0,qdex1,"Brace yourselves, the meta is shifting",Shabobo,66,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/qdex1/brace_yourselves_the_meta_is_shifting/


I’ve noticed a lot of rage on this subreddit recently, you are buying your wins, and it takes no thought, blah blah blah. I think what’s happening is the game is shifting to a different style of gameplay, and we’re upset because we hate change. Some points I think we should know:

1.	Konami is a corporation. “they don’t game about balance” “they just want money”. Guess what? The sole objective of any corporation is to make as much profit as possible for the benefit of their employees, to keep making a profit, Konami has to turn out booster packs/structure decks/reprints people want. If Konami releases a weak archtype that gets crushed by everything else currently played, who’s going to buy it? They have to add cards so people will buy them. Banifish in GenF sucked. To compensate, they added XYZ monsters. Photon shockwave’s evol and photon arch-types are also pretty weak. They added more XYZ, introduced Rescue rabbit. ORCS gave us ninja’s which are cool, but they also gave us insectizors and wind-ups. Would you buy gen force if it just had fish in it? The “OP” cards are added as secret rares to make you want to buy them. I think why this upsets us is because these strong cards are introduced and not all of us have access to them financially.

2.	Cards too strong, but only after Snoww and Grapha were released, did peoplecomplain of their power. Less than a few months later, we’ve accepted them as alright. Not tier 0, but still competitive. Why? Because the release of DW was a slow process to build up their viability, and then when the key cards were released, everyone had access to them. You can get the key card for dark worlds for a buck each. This gets you physically strong, it’s still a 2700 beat stick you can use. Tour guide and rescure rabbit

3.	“But wind-ups and insectizors can beat you first turn. It’s too consistent. Who cares about attack?” I feel like our anger towards these cards stems from the fact that **They get to play their deck however they want

4.	“But that’s not fair.” What the hell do you mean that’s not fair? That fucker just dropped half a grand on some cardboard. You think you deserve to play your 30 buck deck and get the same results? Bullshit. If you want to invest more time and money into your hobby

5.	We fucking hate side-decking. When we play on the DN we want to play 1 game, I can lose the first game, but sweep the last two with ease. 

6.	This meta isn’t focused on your main deck anymore. Think about it. Each deck you make will only be on the top for so long. Insectizors are strong. All I have to do to beat them, solemn, etc. and next turn shadow imprisoning mirror. I take 5 cards to leave only 35 I wanted in the first place, to absolutely shut down their 40. All of it. Tiger king shuts down wind-ups because when it comes to attack, they’re weak as fuck. Thunder king stops any searching and can negate special summons. How many times has he been reprinted, recently? Eff veiler getting reprinted too? It’s almost as if Konami realizes how strong these new archtypes are, and wants to give you more access to give you more of a fighting chance.


TL;DR: We need to adapt. I ran straight 6 sams for a while until I pulled a super polymerization from the legendary collection. Plants were very popular and in 1 turn you were usually looking at a very powerful synchro dragon that was tough to remove. I thought to myself, my warrior, and this card, and it can’t be stopped. What if they didn’t use one? Well, what other fusion cards could I add to make super poly not a dead draw? By adding alius and stratos to my six sam deck, I have access to extremely powerful fusion E hero cards. My six sams are of every attribute, so I have access to the shining, etc. Hell, and yoinks them away like the god-damned relinquished. Our staple cards are shifting

(please leave feedback on the video if you watch!)

So the topic I'm asking r/yugioh today is what you guys think of the lack of a solid source for finding and citing rulings. Sure, official rulings. Things get further complicated when you consider that sometimes different judges in different areas will rule scenarios differently.

I remember that we used to have netrep, and Wikia being a heavily debated source, we're left mainly with forums and the Adjudication facebook group (which even specifies that it's not a source, but rather a discussion portal). 

Where do you guys all go for rulings? And how about at your local shops? Do the judges go somewhere specifically

I feel like this a major issue, we've got the North America WCQ coming up.

So what are you guys' opinions? Open discussion in the comments with thoughts and maybe even suggestions for solving this problem! Don't forget to watch the video,False,self,t5_2rpe6,False,,,t3_1ht83x

1362059704.0,19e8i3,Going Gagaga - A Gaga-Guide,G-0ff,50,9,18,"With apologies for the awful pun, they're extremely versatile and capable of some big surprises.

One interesting (and marginally annoying) thing about Gagagas is that the archetype is effectively split into two discreet strategies that don't have great synergy with one another. The spellcaster-type gagagas tend to work well with gagaga magician, the caesar variant in a later post. Now without further ado:

**Radio Gagaga**

**Introduction**

This is the Gagaga Magician build. it focuses on toolboxing with rank 3-8 xyzs (you can run 1s and 2s

Strategy typically involves getting your gagaga magician and gagaga girl into your hand or graveyard, or monster reborn to get them both out and XYZ summon. Before you have this setup, you're going to need to stall, though on the bright side this gives you a good look into your opponent's deck and insight on how it runs. From there, you can turn your opponent's strategy on its head and use it to help you fulfill your own win conditions, or simply lock them down and chip away until you win.

*Pros* 

* No really good or bad matchups. Can respond to almost anything with proper strategy
* Can turn the game around easily once you know your opponent's deck. Really strong in mid-long games.
* Packs some big surprises and a potential two-card OTK just by running the way it normally runs.
* Works with chaos monsters. Chaos monsters are always good.

*Cons*

* Can be slow to start. Has a weak early game.
* Makes heavy use of the graveyard and is thus vulnerable to macro cosmos.
* Likewise
* If you can't get magician and girl out or in the graveyard

**The Deck:**

*Monsters:*

**Gagaga Magician** - The heart and soul of the deck. Can change his level to anything you want. The only drawback is that you can only have one on the field

**Gagaga Girl** - Waifu card number 1. If magician is the soul of the deck, but when you xyz summon with just her and another gagaga as materials, you can reduce the attack of one of your opponent's special summoned monsters to 0. Unlike magican, you can use this card for synchro summons, which can allow for some potential tech choices (although extra deck space will be tight as it is). **Run 3**

**Gagaga Kid** - This adorable little guy comes out in june, but that's a small price to pay to get something like Strike Bounzer out turn one. **Once he's out, Run 3**

**Summoner Monk** - This deck runs a lot of spells and level 4s

**Mystic Tomato** - Gagaga Magician and Gagaga Girl are darks under 1500. The math here is easy. Plus this little fruit can stall like a reborn tengu before pulling them out

**Tour Guide** - Have we circlejerked enough today about missing Sangan? I *really* fuckin' miss sangan. Anyway, plus other engine cards if you have room**

**Thunder King Rai-Oh** - King of the stun/stall cards

**Cyber Dragon** - This deck runs a lot of rank 5s, a light monster, and I think you're starting to see where I'm going with this. **Run 2-3**

**Star Drawing** - Easy rank 4 or 5 and turns summoner monk and xyz summons in general into +0s rather than -1s. Unfortunately

**Chaos Sorceror** - High level

**Gorz the Emissary of Darkness** - Great for stalling (have I mentioned the deck is a little slow) and easily combos with magician to make big eye. (conveniently

**Dark Armed Dragon** - A power card, and many darks need to stay in the graveyard in order to keep your toolbox open. Still, a viable option for bringing out big eye. **Run 0-1**

**Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning** Still one of the best single monsters in the game, he falls within the bounds of your toolbox. You can clear out up to 3 card by banishing with his effect and then making Heliopolis, then attack for game. (though most of the time, keeping BLS is preferable) **run 1**

**Tragoedia** - Easy summoning, the deck tends to neg a lot in making its big plays, so you won't often bring him out at full strength, and using his effect means negging more. **Run 1-2**

**Hand Traps** - mostly a matter of preference whether you main or side these. Maxx C and Veiler are both good here for different reasons

*Spells*

**Gagagarevenge** - Oh man, it pulls a giga-brilliant and boosts every XYZ monster you control by 300 atk (including the one you just summoned). Roach and Strike Bounzer are tough to beat on their own, but that 300 boost can push them into unstoppable territory. Combined with Girl's effect you can beat over almost anything and do some hefty damage to boot. **Run 3.**

**Gagaga Bolt** - Costless spot destruction

**Gagagadraw** - Provides much-needed draw power, but this is still an iffy card at best **Run 0-2**

**Gagagawind** - Coming in Lord of the Tachyon Galaxy, which makes it a little tenuous strategically. On the plus side, lets you summon around hidden armory. **Run 1-2 when it comes out**

**Gagagaback** - With a painful cost and a situational effect

**Hidden Armory** - Since the deck relies so heavily on Gagaga Revenge to function properly, as it can search not only the deck, but the graveyard as well. Its cost is paltry (mill one card) and can even help set up your graveyard if you're lucky but the restriction it places on you is hefty - no normal summons or sets the turn you use it. It basically lets you run revenge at 5, though, so it's worth using. **run 2**

**Foolish Burial** - Helps set up revenge plays. Easy choice as fodder for summoner monk **run 1**

**Mind Control** - You can XYZ with literally anything you want

**XYZ Unit** - The deck focuses on xyz monsters and has equip searching ability, and gives you an extra use of any XYZ effect **Run 0-1**

**Wonder Wand** - usable for similar reasons to XYZ unit

**Spell Wall** - Can protect you if your opponent is running heavy backrow

**Inferno Reckless Summon** Can set up some pretty crazy plays in combination with Gagaga Revenge and Gagaga girl. **Run 0-1**

**Staples** - Monster Reborn, MST. The usual. Forbidden Lance can also be useful. I advise against running Pot of Duality, despite the slowness of the deck, because if you use it with hidden armory you can end up royally screwing yourself.

*Traps*

**Gagagashield** - Faaaaaaantastic generic spellcaster protection, or big eye from destruction by battle or card effect twice in a turn, with no cost. Stops dark hole, Almost always forces your opponent to -1 by dropping MST, or else stops them from OTKing you by making them attack the same monster three times. **Run 2-3 when it drops on March 8th**

**Gagagaguard** Not to be confused with Gagagashield. Generally you won't be leaving your Gagagas on the field for more than one turn, especially game 1. Tech at your own risk. **Run 0-1**

**Gagagarush** same as guard logic applies

**Magician's Circle** - Probably the best search card in the deck, allows you to look through their deck if they claim not to have targets, and grants you a replay as long as it resolves. With priority you can also sneak your summoned monster around mirror force. Just remember to side it out against prophecies. **Run 2-3**

**XYZ Reborn** - This deck XYZ summons a lot

**Staples** As with almost anything, and torrential are also valid choices. Since the deck is spell-heavy, and runs a good few hand traps and quick-effect XYZs, I advise keeping it trap-light.

*Extra Deck*

Key cards will be explained. This is a toolbox, you want at least one xyz for each rank between 3 and 8.

*-the essentials-*

**Gagaga Cowboy** - Already a staple pretty much everywhere, his burn effect sets up your OTK nicely **Run 1**

**Steelswarm Roach** - Good stun card

**Photon Strike Bounzer** - Same as roach and almost as easy to summon. If your opponent doesn't minus

**Gaia Dragon the Thunder Charger** - Make cheap plays with mind control

**Number 11: Big Eye** - Obscenely useful here. Steal big monsters to XYZ with them or just keep them on the field and run your opponent into the ground with his own cards. As a spellcaster

**Number 33: Chronomaly Machu Mech** - This is your OTK card. Once your opponent has special summoned a monster bigger than 2800 attack (2650 if you use gagagarevenge, and a paltry 2000 if you have XYZ unit and revenge), bring out gagaga magician and gagaga girl. XYZ and use girl's effect to reduce the monster to 0 atk, then burn them for their original attack, gain that much attack for machu mech, and attack the 0 atk monster for game. (2800+2400+2800 = 8000). This card can also turn things around on fire fists, noble knights, and wipes the floor with things like dark mist and heroic champion excalibur. Very versatile

**Chimeratech Fortress Dragon** - You run cyber dragon

**Chronomaly Crystal Chrononaut** or **Number 20: Giga-Brilliant** - More or less your choice here. The important part is not their effects (although both are good) but rather their attribute. If you open with Tour Guide and BLS or Chaos Sorceror

*-pick a card

**Leviair the Sea Dragon**

**Wind-Up Zenmaines**

**Temtempo the Percussion Djinn**

**Number 30: Acid Golem** (consider this essential if anyone at your locals runs skill drain)

**Number 39: Utopia**

**Number c39: Utopia Ray**

**Photon Papilloperative**

**Maestroke the Symphony Djinn**

**Abyss Dweller**

**Tiras

**Adreus

**Number 61: Volcasaurus**

**Wind-Up Arsenal Zenmaioh**

**Empress of Prophecy**

**Number 6: Chronomaly Atlandis**

**Number 25: Force Focus**

**Constellar Ptolemy M7**

**Hieratic Sun Dragon Overlord of Heliopolis**

**Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings**

**Number 22: Zombiestein**

**Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Killer**

*Side Deck Strategy:*

You'll mainly side in the standards of the format - extra MSTs, Soul Taker, Soul Drain, etc. You can also side in extra copies of tech cards, like an extra gagaga bolt, cyber dragon, Tragoedia or gagaga draw. Remember

One card that I like to side in is Level Limit: Area B. This helps to shut down Atlantean OTKs, dark worlds, and a lot of other high-tier decks, and it doesn't affect your gagagas in the slightest.

My only other suggestion would be to use a couple slots in your side to expand your extra deck toolbox. Generally speaking,,False,self,t5_2rpe6,1362059892.0,,True

1374732099.0,1j0fj9,So I just wrote an email to Konami...,pwnag3igor,83,36,87,"&gt;Hello
&gt;
&gt;First things first
&gt;
&gt;However, break it"" pattern that localizations have taken in nearly every set. There are plenty of Japanese cards with names that were already in English/katakana, but were changed drastically for no visible reason.
&gt;
&gt;Example of a card translation that I (and many others) were displeased with: Photon Papilloperative.
&gt;
&gt;There was no reason to change this card. As far as I can see,"" on the other hand, has no advantages to ""Butterfly Assassin,"" and the only difference is that ""Papilloperative"" is harder to pronounce."" Even a change to Butterfly Assailant following the pattern of Night Assassin becoming Night Assailant would have worked.
&gt;
&gt;Again with ""Battlin' Boxers."" The original Burning Knucklers was perfectly acceptable English, there were an abundance of better, less juvenile-sounding words that could have replaced the name, such as Burning Boxers, Battle Boxers, Battling Boxers, Battle Knuckles
&gt;
&gt;A more recent case: Star Eater. The card art shows a dragon hatching from a star, both of which are much less fierce cards. Even if one were to ignore the original name 星態龍 (or Celestial Dragon as the fan translation called it), there are more powerful-sounding words. One Reddit user suggested Solar Devourer as an alternative name, which still sounds far better than Star Eater.The name Star Eater leaves far less of a resonant image of a powerful Synchro monster than the other names that fans have suggested.
&gt;
&gt;Try and keep the names loyal to the anime canon if possible. Googly-Eyes Drum Dragon misses the point of sounding like Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon
&gt;
&gt;However
&gt;
&gt;I particularly liked the localization of the cards in the Saga of Blue-Eyes Structure Deck, and Eyes of Blue were a concise and elegant way to distinguish between the three names, 蒼眼, 青眼, and 青き眼. 
&gt;
&gt;Likewise
&gt;
&gt;At the end of the day
&gt;Keep the names elegant


&gt;Try and preserve flavor in names. Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon sounds cool because it's a direct upgrade of 
Blue-Eyes White Dragon. Star Eater sounds weak because it sounds like an evolution of Level Eater instead of an iconic Synchro monster like Stardust Dragon.


&gt;If it ain't broke
&gt;
&gt;Again
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;

1357270650.0,15xhk6,I've been scammed! What do I do?!,PsychicStardust,56,14,39,"Alright, I will explain the steps you need to take to avoid being scammed

In addition

----------------------------------------------
**I think this jerk stole stuff from me?! What do I do now?!**
-----------------------------------------------

The very first step in determining whether you should take action against another person for scamming should always be calming yourself down and taking a few considerations:

&gt;**1. What time of year is it?**

Around the holiday season and such mail tends to be slower than normal. This is due to the increased volume of mail heading in and out of the postal service. During December

&gt;**2. How far away does this person live?**

International trades will take longer than normal trades. I've traded with a few Canadians before and UK residents. It usually takes around 2 weeks to get to them. Always always always send with some sort of tracking information. This is how most mail and trades are lost.

&gt;**3. Does this person have good feedback?**

If you go on the feedback page

-----------------------------------------------
**HOW TO AVOID BEING SCAMMED**
-----------------------------------------------

There are definitely plenty of ways to protect yourself. I

&gt; **1. Check the feedback thread**

As a rule, the more people they've traded with. This means they've done that many trades without scamming a person. As a rule, anyone with 0 feedback should steer clear of anyone else with 0-5 feedback. Stick to the 20+ people. Otherwise, you can either bite the bullet and go on with the trade or buy off-site.

&gt; **2. *ALWAYS* use some form of identification on trades over a $10 value.**

 If you've traded with me, there is a decreased chance of the envelope getting lost in the mail. As for delivery confirmation, it's 80 cents. Not even twice the price of normal postage. I cannot speak for UK or Canadian residents unfortunately. So, on average you'll be spending $1.00~ on trades. Aaron Carver knows a website where you can buy bubble mailers very cheap. Go bother him about it if you want to save even more cash. 

The extra 50 cents for added security will benefit you if it does get lost or stolen. You can file mail fraud against someone if you end up getting scammed. Without delivery confirmation, it's not that expensive. Just do it.

&gt; **3. Be aware of the trader's attitude and deals.**

 If the trader is rude to other people in his or her thread, very trustworthy trader; you won't be getting a Mermail Abyssmegalo for that Mokey Mokey. Just be aware.


&gt; **4. Never send ""at the same time"".** 

Most of the threads I've noticed complaining about scammers are those who sent at the same time. Always agree who's sending what first. You may be in a hurry to get the cards before regionals next week

-----------------------------------------------

I wouldn't recommend sending cash in an envelope

---------------------------------------------

Okay so

With every trade you should have the PMs from the deal. Don't confirm the deal in your trade thread. Confirm it in PMs. Trade posts can be edited. Message the other user and ask if they've sent out your end. It's always good to wait at least 25 to 30 days to tell if you've been scammed. If the person does not reply to you after 2 days, and a bad attitude will not help your case. I know being scammed sucks. It's happened to me too. 

-----------------------------------------------

**So I've definitely been scammed. Now what?**

If you've taken the steps above

**Mail fraud form:**

https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/forms/mailfraudcomplaint.aspx

--------------------------------------

**Someone accused me of scamming them

Assuming you didn't actually rip them

--------------------------------------------

**That's all fine and dandy. How to I protect myself offline?**

Stuff gets stolen at regionals all the time. Here's what you do to stay safe!

&gt; **1. Bring friends**

Friends are the best thing in the world aside from a mint condition 1st ed IOC BLS. All joking aside

&gt; **2. Don't bring more than you're willing to lose**

If you can't live without it, extra-deck, a deck box, an extra pair of sleeves, and whatever money you need for food. If you want to bring a trade binder then that's perfectly fine. Just don't pack everything into it.

&gt; **3. Don't take your eyes off of your things**

Obviously you want to stay focused on your game and that's where you'll get jacked. Easiest thing to do is NEVER put your bag behind you, or in another room. If you need your bag off of the table, tie the strap around your leg. If you use a drawstring bag, wrap it somewhere safe ON YOUR BODY. This is so that if someone tries to open or grab it, you'll feel it happen. Never leave your deck unattended. I know you're excited to see the pairings for the next round. Just don't forget your deck on the table.

---------------------------------

If you find yourself missing something then you're not entirely out of luck. Talk to people around you and see if they noticed anything. I know a guy whose had binders stolen from them at premier events and he got enough evidence to get his stuff back (with a little bonus due to the theif using the stolen binder as his own). 

------------------------------------------

That's all I have for you right now. Take these easy steps to prevent yourself from losing out. I'd like to request this to be in the side-bar and it would be nice to have a heading for trading information to make the feedback thread

This is part Regional report, which is to make sure a) no cards are marked and b) the deck-list and the deck contents are identical. It wouldn't seem to be particularly stressful job

**I do not like giving out warnings. I do not like giving out game-losses. I try to be player-friendly when I can.**

As a Deck Check Lead, because that would seem biased. However, by the end of the day, we covered a good majority of the top tables (1-20) and had already checked most of them. That's good. That reassures to me that little if no deck cheating was going on, as far as I was aware. These checks were random, and I sent an inconspicuous teammate out to collect the decks. I tend to stand out as a female judge, whereas the guys can kind of blend in. 

So how it works: Team Lead sends the team members to get the decks. They wait until the players have presented their decks to each other, extra) into their boxes, and then they bring it back to the table where we work. I've already pulled out the deck-list by then, from where we have them sorted alphabetically. Quickly, we sort by spells/traps/monsters, verify and confirm contents. Afterwards, we check for things like marked sleeves and marked cards, including but not limited to: thumbing the top of the deck to make sure no sleeves are longer than they should be, etc. 

Most deck-checks, things go wrong, players get mad.

I had one situation at Norcross where I suspected the player had left his deck in his car, and they had the same results that I had. I talked it over with the head judge **before** I went to talk to the player, and the HJ confirmed with me that I needed to give him 3 minutes to find replacements. I bandied about the idea of letting him use proxies, but it wasn't possible. Bearer of bad news, the player was obviously not too happy to hear me tell him that.

But that's just the thing; at some point, or telling you to take your drinks off the table, you have to realize: **we're just doing our job, and I'm trying my hardest to make sure everyone has fun at the tournament**. Our job is to make the event enjoyable and fair for all players involved. I know it wasn't fair to the player with the marked cards to have to replace them so soon, but it also wasn't fair to his opponent to have his opponent have marked cards. Consider that before you get angry next time a judge tells you that you need to buy a new pack of sleeves.

It starts with Konami's apparent lack of support for the game. It seems apparent that they don't seem to care too much about YCS coverage and so on. MTG usually has someone streaming their big tournaments with live updates everywhere you can get em. With Yu-Gi-Oh! it seems that relying on people at the event is the best way for immediate coverage! 

But that's only the reason that sparked this idea. I'm not saying we make our own banlist to play by that'd be silly. Konami is a corporation with the only goal in mind is to make profit. They will release broken sets and seemingly unfair banlists if that's what it takes for them to make some cash.

Konami isn't the devil, catch the next one! I'd love to do this for the community and see if we can't get us some awesome, potentially meta-defining tournaments going. There is only one issue with casting the games and that is at the moment my headset picks up a little bit of white noise. It is somewhat faint but until I can order a proper casting microphone, stand, etc. (roughly $120) it will have to do. I also need to learn some of the combos that Mermails and Spellbook do. I've just gotten back into the game after a 5ish month break but I should be able to pick up quickly on them by playing them on DN and watching videos on YouTube, thus allowing me to cast them more effectively.

1375770303.0,1jsosq,YCS Toronto Boycott (Why are you not talking about this?),Original67,64,21,112,"From Joe Giorlando:

""YCS Toronto Boycott

I never thought I would write an article about something like this but alas here I am just a mere month before YCS Toronto with an endless stream of thoughts and emotions. For those of you who are not aware, along with the YCS in San Mateo. It has caused quite a significant uproar in the Yu-Gi-Oh community for an array of different issues, and today I feel as though it is time for us as a community to put our foot down and make a statement.

Before I get too far into the topic at hand, and the controversy surrounding the ARG Opens, was not the motivation for writing this article. I had intended on writing this article if YCS Toronto was announced weeks before the boiling point in the Konami negotiations. It just happens to be a coincidence.

I honestly try to sit down each and every week and produce articles which are beneficial to the Yu-Gi-Oh community in a wide variety of manners. Sometimes we talk about individual cards, or it could simply fizzle out. But I really do hope what I am about to say can pick up steam amongst our community because if there was ever a time to make a statement about the health of the Yu-Gi-Oh card game, today is that day.

So with that being said, the bulk of players are unable to find the same priced hotels and transportation in which they would have been able to obtain had Konami appropriately announced their event months in advance. Beyond that, seeing as how they decided to announce an event out of the United States at such a last minute, players who would have originally enjoyed the opportunity to travel outside of the United States to play must already have a passport - or otherwise be forced to pay an increased sum of money for an express produced passport. It is beyond unprofessional for a company with the revenue and experience in organized play to believe they even have the right to abuse their players in this manner. Companies who openly appreciate their players, such as Wizards of the Coast, give their players more than adequate time to plan their trips in accordance with what is affordable and fit appropriately in their lives. It is almost as though Konami lives in their own world and ignores the fact that their player base actually have jobs and cannot simply drop what is going on in their lives in order to book a last minute flight and take time off of work. At most establishments of employment, a weekend off to Toronto would have already needed to be requested. So not only are we as players expected to pay more on travel expenses, ask for time off of work at what very well may be too short of time

That is right. Konami has officially announced an event where there will be a fundamental change in the Forbidden and Limited List when the players amass for Day 2. With this glaring issue, you could very well show up to an event where you would have had no intentionally of originally playing. Who knows, maybe Day 1 is Battle Pack 2 sealed. Maybe it is the March 1, 2013 Forbidden and Limited List. Another tournament for Dragon Ruler and Prophecy. I know I personally have no intention of ever playing that format again, and I bet I am not the only one who believes that. So why in the world would you want to invest your money in going to play another competitive tournament under that list? What if it is the September 1st, 2013 list? That would be exciting. How difficult if it to list what format the event is being held under? Such as simplistic decision which any properly run company would have been made months ago. But nope, not Konami. That is far too logical for a company like Konami. They leave you in the dark, no care for what are our concerns.

I heard rumors about this event months ago. Months ago. It was even listed on the Toronto Convention Centre website. That is right. This event has been in the works for a handful of months. Let that sink in. Konami had the intentions of having this event back when hotels were cheaper

So what are we going to do about it? We could all individually believe that we should not attend. I know I feel that way. I am sick of this treatment, I could afford the trip - but I am staying home. I simply cannot concede to the this treatment. And we as a community should stand up and say no. That is the only way in which Konami will ever listen to our requests. Hit their wallet. Hit it hard. It costs Konami a lot of money to hold these events. Let them look over their field of players in shock. They deserve it. They deserve to tank tens of thousands of dollars. I know this article, Facebook group or YouTube video will not be able to hold the attendance to zero. But we can damn sure try. We can try to ‪#‎OccupyYGO‬, and if we fail - we can make noise. We can make a lot of noise. How many people have historically attended YCS Toronto? What if we can put up an attendance under 100? How about a venue filled with players but no one entering the event? or side events? A Yu-Gi-Oh blackout. Tell Konami how you feel about their event, and how they have decided to treat their player base.
Now I know, we must be willing to make the sacrifice of this statement. Life goes on, there are more events. We can sit one out. Trust me, this is yet another event to give you the chance of finally winning a YCS or getting that first top. I know both of those feelings, one of which I live in to this day. But sometimes there are other things in life beyond that. What do we want as players? Better coverage. Live streams. Real rankings. Cash prizes. Better feature matches. Deck techs. New tournaments. Yu-Gi-Oh World Cup. Yu-Gi-Oh Players Championship. Real commentary. We want change. Let's make the sacrifice, and state what we want profoundly. It is just one event. Life continues after.

A few days ago I posted about the idea I had to make a site called YuGiOh! PlayBook! I expected some positive feedback, it's time to call out to the community to start populating YuGiOh! Playbook! I even coded a sweet editor for those heavy contributors that might eventually get access directly to the site's database ;)

The site currently has one entry: http://ygoplaybook.com/deck.php?id=1
If you plan to contribute, or let them choose their own.

Remember that the site's layout is not complete

**If** you run a META DECK, how to pull them off, and a decklist. You can submit full decklists, but I will only be adding the core parts of them. Remember, PLAYS are the most important part of the site, so if you plan to contribute, be very descriptive and clear. At the moment there's no way to submit via the site (there will be tomorrow)

**If** you're interesting in developing for the site, you'll be contacted shortly as well.

**If** you can donate to the site, entries are still created from scratch.

**If** there's any hackers/skiddies/crackers out there

**Lastly**, the actual deck list section (which is almost done), tech cards, and much more. If you can think of any more information that would be beneficial if displayed on a deck page, do not hesitate to post it! Remember, the biggest contributors will eventually gain direct access to modifying the site.

**Mini-guide**

* Note: This goes for this variation of deck, not merchant, etc. Also, I am bad at guides soooo yeahh....

Basically the main focus is to put Wights (King

The deck's engine is mainly the Lightsworns. You want to try to put as many Wights in the graveyard as possible so milling as much as you can is a good thing. Ryko is great for a first turn wall or something that you can't get over. Lyla is good for S/T removal. Jain is mainly just a beater than can attack for 2100. Card Trooper is in there for milling too. Going back to 400 atk kinda sucks but the draw when it's destroyed is worth it.

Zombie Master helps for swarming and reviving other zombies while putting Wights in the graveyard. Snipe Hunter is also decent for putting things in the graveyard. It's like a risky Ryko but he can potentially clear a lot of the field. Goblin Zombie is a searcher (having your opponent mill their top card is nice too

DaD

You can actually run some common XYZ monsters. I definitely recommend packing a few Utopias (too OP) and generic Rank 4's. Slacker Magician is a great Rank 1. Leviathan Dragon

The spells are mainly to draw (Allure of Darkness/Pot of Avarice)

The trap lineup is completely whatever you want to do. I just chose them because I like them. Threatening Roar is good for another round of milling or to just stop an attack (duh lol). Fiendish Chain to stop an effect and attack. Compulsory bounces. Fiend Comedian is a fun card just because it either helps you mill or banish your opponents graveyard.

I scoped out an area of town that is filled with schools and residential areas and doesn't have a card store or game shop. Before you ask, if I make a solid, well defined case that minimizes risk to the utmost extent, will give me a good chance at making this loan to me.

Here's the idea. A card store with enough space to hold 20-30 person locals and a small 5 computer area for hourly use for LAN events. I'm tinkering with the idea of doing a video game section as well but the profit margins on it seem minimal at best

I am going to speak with a former boss of mine who owns a small business (different category but he can help with the small business questions aspect of it). I also have a friend who can get me on speaking terms with my current locals card shop owner. He's a pretty cool guy but I have no idea if he'll even talk about the financial part of being an owner with a customer so I'll approach it from the friend of a friend perspective.

To compete with online I will offer trade in values for easy to liquidate cards and sell on an eBay/ TCGPlayer front as well. I happen to know someone who will be able to assist me with the manpower ordeal for minimal wage.

Anyway, execution"" part. My question is ""How bad of an idea is it to open a card store?"" and ""What would you do to your local card store if you ran the place?""

Some of the ""special things"" I've decided to take from other stores/ experience:

* I understand that the retail aspect is simply to draw people in so they're comfortable spending money.

* Pack wars vs the store

* Small tournies if a group of friends stops by

Gamble deck's are overall very fun and an oddly large amount of good effects

It is by far my oldest and most likely well known deck

**Main Objective in a Duel:**To have a stupid amount of fun. Also to win by a single coin toss.

**Win Condition:**Half the time Burn seems to be the answer. Or getting amazing luck.

**Important Cards**

**MONSTERS**

Here are some really good ones that should be included in any Gamble Deck.

**Time Wizard:** The classic Gamble Monster

**Sasuke Samurai #4:**He's simply amazing in the deck with his any attribute Catastor Like Effect(Which even works if attacked face-down)and personally I run at 3. Potential to take down multiple boss monsters.

**Twin-Barrel Dragon:**He's a one shot chance at a destruction but stupidly satisfying if you get two heads. Also a 1700 Dark Beater. Ran 2-3.

**Dice Jar:**A card to be feared and loved. Up to 6000 burn to either player you might just win a game early due to them using solemn warning. Best ran at 1.

**Jirai-Gumo:**Yes yes I know he has a horrible effect but a 2200 4 star who fits the theme? Sign me up. Usually best to just sit on it unless you're feeling lucky or have Second Coin Toss out. Ran at 1.

**Blowback Dragon:**1 Tribute

**Maximum Six:**He's only a 1900 attack monster but his effect makes up for it to being a stupidly large beater

**Gambler of Legend:**This guy is just silly sometimes and other times completely useless. Take him if you feel like it but don't expect consistency :D

**SPELLS**

**Second Coin Toss:**This is by far the most important card in the deck

**Dicephoon:**It's the gamble MST except better. It can destroy 2 if you roll and 5 and because it is a dice roll your opponent cannot chain cards to their destruction as it is an uncertain effect. I'll go over that later.

**Cup of Ace:**Your best draw power

**The Seal of Orichalcos:**You won't use your Extra Deck so this card is perfect

**Dangerous Machin Type-6:**It's destruction

**Graceful Dice:**Because why not?

**TRAPS**

**The Paths of Destiny:**2000 burn or gain

**Needle Wall:**A constant threat of monster removal for your opponent is just lovely

**Fairy Box:**A great stall/counter card. As it reduces their attack to 0 you might beat down monsters with Time Wizard. Also has a small upkeep cost.

**Skull Dice:**Same reasoning as Graceful.

**EXTRA DECK**

**Number 7:Lucky Straight** To Watch over your Duel in style. Best played face up in the extra deck zone. Only 1 or 3.

**Thousand Dragon:**If you're really feeling the Joey mood.

You can place some generic 4's if you care too but by no means should you have more or less than 7 total Extra Deck Cards.

**TECHS**

**Stall Cards in General:**Marshmellon

**Silver Sentinel:**This deck makes a healthy amount of S/T paranoia

**Question:**If you feel like you can take their memory into a gamble.

**Yu-Jo-Friendship:**Nearly nobody would decline the handshake and it really creates a memory that somebody used it on you. Especially if at a regional or YCS.

**OTHER STUFF**

A few of you may be asking

Maybe you have some other gamble cards in mind that you would like to use

Snipe Hunter is good yes however his cost puts a toll on this deck.

On the nature of uncertain effects as mentioned with Dicephoon. Due to you can not say for certain destruction will happen you cannot chain say Starlight road to Dicephoon if it destroys. The destruction is on the resolution of the card so cards will miss their timing to chain. You must chain TO a gamble card if it has no guaranteed effect.

There is one amazing power that the Gamble Deck Has. They can side in Macro and tons of side deck options like Soul Drain or Magic Drain with no fear of it hurting.

Other than that the best thing to do with this deck is to have a ton of fun and make memorable duels. Also the complete deck is less than 30 dollars to complete.",self,t5_2rpe6,1362071775.0,,dark,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/19d2j0/gamblea_guide/

1373255450.0,1huch0,Thank you /r/YuGiOh!,HeyItsJay,55,16,29,"Thank you /r/YuGiOh .

My name is Jay and I was left under your wing about half a year ago.

My journey with Yu-Gi-Oh started on January 2013.  Format wonky and I started off with a mish-mash of HEROES at my first locals.

The very first time I went to a locals I had lost every single game but 1.  I was so happy to have won a game though I'm sure it was just out of sheer luck.

When I first started Yu-Gi-Oh I did so out of boredom

I then got hooked into it due to the competition of it and just the general atmosphere.  Reddit has helped me to be a better duelist than I would have alone

Half a year has passed since I learned the game

You guys have shown me what it means to appreciate what I have (in terms of cards) to show my opponents the ropes if they are new.  To show decency and appreciation for the finer things that people put their hard work into.  I've picked up quite a few things to learn from you guys and all of it is appreciated.

I'm saying all this as I've sold my collection (YA YOU LOST OUT MICHAEL

I should be around 101 Positive Feedback and I feel that is a fine spot to stop at for the time being.  I will continue to play and all that though I won't be trading actively anymore.  I feel that it's necessary to slow myself down so I can keep enjoying the game as it was intended.  

I've met plenty of good friends here and I'm sure you guys know who you are you bad League players and worse duelists you.  I'll try and stick around in terms of helping people because let's be honest.  You can't really quit Reddit or the Internet.  So I'll continue to provide help to those in need!  Though now I find it appropriate to say Thank you for all the things that this community has done.  I know I might be just a no one here but I feel that I've helped a good amount of people!  I don't need any cards or any cash in regards to it but I'd like for you to pass it forward, I did not expect to be where I am right now 6 months past, but I am.

I've sold you guys plenty and I've traded you all plenty

Thank you for everything.

**I'm also wondering where my Sheet of High-Five paper is currently.  I started a thing quite some time ago that had a piece of paper with a high-five and a note to write your /r/yugioh name and date on it.  I'm wanting that back if it ever gets back to me :P and I hope it has traveled many places!**

Context:

Went into a random tag match, chained to, or destroyed, and you can't activate any other field spells.  Opponent uses Big Eye to steal our Paladin and kill our Scrap Dragon, leaving us with 75 LP.  Partner's Meklord Emperor Granel gains ATK equal to half your LP, so he's sitting at the incredibly feeble, incredibly awkward 38 ATK.

Believe it or not, bringing back the first Scrap Dragon to pop Big Eye, leaving them with a basically empty field and both top-decking.  E-Dragon player gets out Redox and ends his turn.  Then my partner tried to use Scrap's effect to pop the field spell which doesn't work, realized he messed up, and quit.

I started playing yugioh again after a four year break and I needed many new cards. I went to my locals to buy a lot of stuff like binders, as I was leaving the store with my duelist friend, the shop owner told me that I would have to spend at least $20 on merchandise to be allowed back into the store and that my friend is banned from the store. This really rustled my jimmies. 

He doesn't even let you trade in the building. He expects a no trading policy and if we even walk out the store and across the street to trade, and I never broke the stupid rules he set up. Now, I'm going to have to hear shit from him for his stupid assumption. 

I thought he would have more common sense to value me as a customer, I will not be purchasing anything. 

TL;DR: My locals is a dick.

**posting your trade thread**

* please avoid all cap posts. New posts are less than a dozen a day. If I checked the subreddit today

* please do not bark orders. You are more than welcome to post ""I don't send first"" or ""won't send for less than 5 bucks in trades""

* Please post an imgur link of your binder, but i may be willing to trade for something i hadn't thought about or listed if i see it in your trades.

* do not ask for us to message you on youtube or pojo. Do not come to OUR trade community and then tell us to work out the detail on YOURS. It's rude. If you're going to use our resources to branch out to potential new traders

* after about a day of posting your binder

**finalizing a trade**

* have a camera readily available. Before a trade is finalized many traders will want to see photo ""proof"" that you own the card often with a piece of paper next to the card with your user name and time.

* Use the pm feature to send your trading address. try avoiding posting your personal information to the public.

* be willing to at least send at the same time

* people are wary of new reddit accounts. I have a lot more to lose trading on my year old built up reddit account and then not being able to trade on this subreddit than a new user with no posts or karma has. Yes

**completing the trade**

* Cards when sent should be sleeved and preferably in a top loader. Do not cram too many cards in one toploader and risk bending. Also

* send your cards out in a timely manner. feel free to pm your trader if you got behind on sending them out

* once you receive cards

* please check reddit at least once a day

**Avoiding scams**

* ask for photo evidence/time stamp with a new user.

* ask a new user to possibly send first.

* be willing to lose what you're trading. If your card values are more than you're willing to risk trading with the person

* keep up to date with pojo and reddit for addresses to avoid. Not to be biased but san diego is often the source of a lot of scams. Make sure the trade is secured with trade cred established.

For those of you that aren't: it's a list put together by Judge Alex Gravely that makes it easier to figure out under which scenarios cards can and cannot be used under the effects of Prohibition and Psi-Blocker.

Let’s say that Machina Fortress is declared.

You CANNOT:

* Normal Summon (includes Gemini Summon).
* Set without a card effect.
* Special Summon without a card effect that starts a Chain.
* Use as Fusion Material.
* Use as Synchro Material.
* Use as Xyz Material.
* Declare an attack.
* Change its battle position manually.
* Activate or apply its effects. (If it’s a Spell/Trap Card

You CAN:

* Special Summon it through a card effect like Monster Reborn.
* Add it to your hand through the effect of Machina Gearframe.
* Tribute it for the cost for the second effect of Enemy Controller.
* Change its battle position through the effect of A/D Changer.
* Use it for a Ritual Summon.
* Use it for the effect of Future Fusion.
* Use it as Tribute for the Tribute Summon of any applicable monster.

[Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo  x1](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Number_88:_Gimmick_Puppet_of_Leo)

The whole focus of this deck is to

You start this process by dumping 
[Darklord Superbia](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Darklord_Superbia),[Card Destruction](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Card_Destruction) and the effects of [Dark Grepher](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Grepher) and have 3 level 4 monsters out on the field including [Phantom of Chaos](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Phantom_of_Chaos). A simple way to get that field is to Specail Summon Grepher by pitching, then summoning Summoner Monk and activating his effect to Special Summon Phantom of Chaos from your deck, but at this point, like I said earlier, you will need your grave to be set up. There are many other ways to achieve this field(i.e. Instant Fusion, multiple Grephers and Reborn) but the grave is the hard part. The next step is to overlay 2 of the 3 monsters(not Phantom of Chaos) and special summon a Lavalval Chain. You will activate his effect to place a monster from your deck on top of your deck, and that card of course being Dark Creator. You should now have enough monsters in your graveyard to Special Summon Dark Creator. After summoning him

**If you are summoning Arcana Force XXI** then you will need more darks in the graveyard but instead of using Dark Creator to Special Summon Darklord Superbia

**If you are summong Darklord Zerato** then after summoning Zerato off of Superbia's effect you are either going to just straight up attack him or go the ballsy route and overlay all 3 for [Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Number_88:_Gimmick_Puppet_of_Leo) and  give you opponent 2 topdeck chances to make a comeback.

What decks does this deck struggle against?

In my experience this deck struggles against the following: 

* Evilswarm

A frst turn Ophion really hurts this deck.

*  Elemental Dragon's/Dragon Rulers

Dragon Ruler's/Elemental Dragon's could care less if you send there hand to the grave

I take no credit for being the creator of this deck

* [Fiendish Chain](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Fiendish_Chain): It's like a Veiler who won't get ruined by Macro Cosmos. Fun. **Run 2-3**

* [Mirror Force](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Mirror_Force): After attacking into 3 Threatening Roars

* [Gagaga Gunman](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Gagaga_Cowboy)(fuck the TCG name change): Burn baby burn. Make two in one turn

* [Starliege Paladynamo](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Starliege_Paladynamo): All your cards are Light

*The rest of this Extra deck can literally be whatever you want it to be

---

**2.0 The Techs**

* Lets make your deck personal by following my exact choice of techs

*2.1 The Monster Techs*

* [Lava Golem](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Lava_Golem): Give them him and just sit back behind your countless stall. **Run 0-2**

* [Pahunder](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Pahunder): If you want to make this deck a little bit more XYZ-centric

---

*2.2 The Spells*

* [Messenger of Peace](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Messenger_of_Peace): Another really good way to tell your opponent that you really hate them. Do it with a smile though

*This is basically whether you decide Stall or Stun*

* [Solemn Warning](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Solemn_Warning): It's good this format

* [Dimension Wall](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dimension_Wall): You gotta like this card

* [Magic Cylinder](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Magic_Cylinder): It would be an amazing card

* [Compulsory Evacuation Device](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Compulsory_Evacuation_Device): It does what it does. It's good and sometimes great and sometimes exactly what you needed. **Run 0-2**

* [Dimensional Prison](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dimensional_Prison): Doesn't destroy monsters which makes it pretty damn spiffy. **Run 0-2**

**3.0 How the deck plays**

*Slow*

Very slowly. You have to be smart with your resources, you really have to go for it. Hardcore. 

**3.1 The plays**

*Does this deck look like something that can combo? It can't

* Thunder Sea Horse (pitch)

* WattCobra attacks. Only search out another Cobra if you don't have one in your hand. You don't want all 3 to be mind crushed. Search out Giraffe or Pheasant. If Thunder Sea Horse hasn't been played yet


**Boom

*But wait

Since I just screamed at all y'all for however it took you to read this, I'll show you mine.

[Chaos Agents](http://imgur.com/a/SHegk#0).

That is the deck that I am going to be taking to YCS New Jersey. I've taken it to my locals every week for the last month and a half and have topped every single week. My locals are very competitive too

Oh my

Ask me any questions if you will.",self,t5_2rpe6,False,,light,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1dth2n/watt_control_a_comprehensive_guide/
1362002641.0,19croz,Prophecy - A guide,Juyunseen,39,4,23,"Since this seems to be the new thing to do I thought I'd take some time to write one myself.

So Prophecy. That one really expensive deck.

**Disclaimer** I'm only covering the light version of the deck. Someone else can write Reaper Turbo since I know nothing about the deck.

**The Concept** - The deck's concept and objective are simple enough. Use the various spells to generate great drawpower and quickly summon High Priestess for field control and game winning attacks.

**The Monsters**

* High Priestess of Prophecy - The main card of the deck. Easy to use
* Spellbook Magician of Prophecy - This little magician is one of the cruxes of the deck. Easily searched by Spellbook of Secrets
* Temperance of Prophecy - So there are two monsters for getting you into a Priestess quickly. Temperance is my personal preferred of the two
* Justice of Prophecy - Temperance's counterpart. Justice banishes itself to search Priestess and a Spellbook
* Stoic of Prophecy - Basically the deck's Sangan. He searches Justice or Temperance. (Run 0-1)
* Breaker the Magical Warrior - Everybody loves Breaker. One of this deck's weaknesses is its large amount of spells. Breaker is here to counteract that. He's a spellcaster
* Tragoedia - To quote Rimjobronny ""Run this at 2. No arguments, 3000 attack/defense trag to smack them in the face. It's level copying and monster stealing effects are also tremendous, allowing you XYZ plays (Gachi Gachi or Big Eye, anyone?) and OTKS. This is almost a no-brainer to run at 2, in my experience.""

**Optional Monsters**

* Apprentice Magician - Many people run this little card. It gives counters to breaker and can keep your field presence by SSing itself or Spellbook Magician. Useful
* Copycat - Possibly my favorite card to tech in this deck. It's always useful to be sitting on a Copycat in hand

I know other players of the deck will mention other monsters I've forgotten in the comments

**Spells**

* Spellbook of Secrets - The universal searcher for the deck. It gets you any spellbook, then search Tower and activate it turn 1. This gives you an extra draw turn 2, and you need the draw power. (Run 3)
* The Grand Spellbook Tower - The center of your draw power. Return a spellbook to the deck in the standby phase
* Spellbook of Wisdom - Forbidden Lance in Spellbook form. (Run 3)
* Spellbook of Power - +1000 atk for a turn
* Spellbook of Eternity - Your card for reloading banished spellbooks
* Spellbook of Life - A weaker Monster Reborn. Has some costs
* Spellbook of Fate - An underestimated card. High cost
* Spellbook of the Master - A card that I don't own
* Staples - Monster Reborn, but 1-0 MST. You have Breaker. Side MST in case of Macro Cosmos.

**Traps**

* This is a trap-light deck. Run royal decree


**Perks of the deck**

* No need for an extra deck.
* Strong match against Mermails.
* Will become rediculously strong with Lord of the Tacheryion Galaxy (or however you spell it)
* Lots of options. The deck seems to have one or two plays

**Cons of the deck**

* Expensive as all hell
* Bad match with Six Sams
* Has trouble with Macro Cosmos

Overall, budget builds are possible. Endymion the Master Magician and Prophecy Destroyer can fill the Priestess space. The deck will be nowhere near as good, but still decent.",,False,self,t5_2rpe6,,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/19croz/prophecy_a_guide/

1362093877.0,19fe0y,Eww Gross - A Worm Guide,Leukemic,46,10,47,"Hopping on guide bandwagons herp da derp. There is a deck known as Worms that no one knows about with a great unknown power. So much of it got me my Nat. Invite this year. Worms are a stun deck that play 15+ traps and generate advantage with our Win Condition. W Nebula Meteorite is the best card in the deck and I will show you how to abuse it to victory. Now onto the deck.

**Pros:**

Everything is a flip summon so you can play really defensive which works amazing well with traps.

Since everything is a flip summon

Has one of the best traps in the game as its support card

**Cons**

Since everything is a flip summon
Deck is very slow. You can consider this a Pro (I do, format.

**The Deck**

**Monsters**

**Worm Xex:** (Reptile/Effect/1800/1000/4*)

When this card is Normal Summoned

Xex is the bread and butter of the deck. Your main play is to summon Xex, unless you are bad.

**Worm Yagan:** (Reptile/Effect/1000/1800/4*)

If the only monster you control is ""Worm Xex"", select 1 face-up monster your opponent controls, and return it to it's owner's hand.

Your main play is to get this guy dumped into the grave by Worm Xex. You play **3**

**Worm Cartaros:** (Reptile/Effect/1200/500/4*)

FLIP: Add 1 Level 4 or lower Reptile-Type ""Worm"" monster from your Deck to your hand.

A Stratos

**Worm King:** (Reptile/Effect/2700/1100/8*)

This card can be Tribute Summoned in face-up Attack Position by Tributing 1 Reptile-Type ""Worm"" monster. You can Tribute 1 Reptile-Type ""Worm"" monster to select 1 card your opponent controls

He is your boss monster, you should be able to win without the 2nd one.

**Honest:** (Fairy/Effect/1100/1900/4*)

During your Main Phase: You can return this card from the field to its owner's hand. During either player's Damage Step

Your entire deck is light

**Thunder King Rai-Oh:** (Thunder/Effect/1900/800/4*)

Neither player can add cards from their Deck to their hand except by drawing them. During either player's turn, destroy it.

As we all know

**Genex Ally Birdman** (Machine/Tuner/1400/400/3*)

You can return 1 face-up monster you control to the hand to Special Summon this card from your hand

People seem to like Birdman in this deck because with Tri-Force, so I prefer not to run him. Run **0-1** but I would stick with 0.

**Evil Dragon Ananta** (Reptile/Effect/?/?/8*)

This card cannot be Normal Summoned or Set. This card cannot be Special Summoned except by removing from play all Reptile-Type monsters from your side of the field and Graveyard. This card's ATK and DEF are each equal to the number of Reptile-Type monsters you removed x 600. During each of your End Phases

I really interesting card that potentially give several pluses if you can protect it

**The Spells**

Staple stuff really, **MAX OUT ON POT OF DUALITY** so you can help your consistency.

**The Traps**

I like to play 18 Traps, since traps are really all about preference.

**W Nebula Meteorite**

Change all face-down monsters on the field to face-up Defense Position. During the End Phase this turn, you can Special Summon 1 Level 7 or higher LIGHT Reptile-Type monster from your Deck.

This is the card that makes the deck competitive. You plus like a freaking mad man and then get to top it all off with a Worm King on board. An End Phase Nebula is sure to kill your opponent. Summon Xex into Yagan with W Nebula is already a +3. You play **3** NO EXCEPTIONS.

**Call of the Haunted**

Target 1 monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon that target in face-up Attack Position. When this card leaves the field

I play **1** as my personal tech. The amount of plays you can do with this card is unreal. You can do a simple CoTH Xex summon Yagan from grave

So you just W Nebula after a Xex Yagan, and King. Since Yagan was flipped face-down again after being flipped up, it isnt banished when it leaves the field. So King tribute Yagan pop. King tribute himself pop. Now Xex can pull yagan out of grave. Call of the haunted king. Tribute Yagan again, pop. Congrats, you just went +2 and cleared your opponents field :)

The rest of the traps are up to you. Traps you want to take into consideration are **Dimensional Prison, Compulsory Evacuation Device, Fiendish Chain, I recommend double Starlight Road, and Mirror Forces.**

**Offering To The Snake Deity**

Target 1 face-up Reptile-Type monster you control and 2 cards your opponent controls; destroy all three targets.

It is a very similar card to **Icarus Attack** but there is a very small change which is the main reasons I don't run the card.

**The Reason** Destroying your own monster is **NOT** a cost. What does this mean? It means you can't target Face-Down Worms to destroy as opposed to **Icarus Attack**

The only reason I would play the card is so that in certain scenarios, give him another search, and make me go super neg. But since I can't tribute Face-Down monsters, I wouldn't play it.

**Extra Deck**

All you need is staple rank 4s although I will go over some other ones that are a definite must have.

**King Feral Imp** (Reptile/Effect/2300/2000/Rank 4)

2 Level 4 monsters
Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card; add 1 Reptile-Type monster from your Deck to your hand.

At first glance, but you need to be smart about making it at the right time. For example, just because you have a Xex on field and Xex in hand, doesn't mean you go ballz deep and make this guy. It is the better play to simply wait for them to get rid of that Xex, then summon yours and get another Yagan. Or even Summon Xex, dump cartaros (I will make a section about this) to set up a nice Nebby.

**GaGaGa Cowboy** (Warrior/Effect/1500/2400/Rank 4)

2 Level 4 monsters
Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card; apply this effect
● Attack Position: If this card attacks an opponent's monster this turn

This card is the bomb diggity

1. Summon **Worm Xex**

2. Wait until your opponents End Phase or until they attack with something scary and activate **W Nebula Meteorite**, and then special summon a **Worm King**.

3. Now you summon another **Worm Xex**.

4. **OBLITERATE**. 2700 + 1800 + 1800 + 1000 = 7300.

5. **Overlay** for **Gagaga Cowboy** and detach to burn for game.

**Constellar Omega** (Beast-Warrior/Effect/2400/500/Rank 4)

2 Level 4 LIGHT monsters
Once per turn

Pretty self explanatory, pretty simple :)

2 Level 4 LIGHT monsters
Once per turn: You can detach 2 Xyz Materials from this card to target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; its ATK becomes 0

Another pretty self explanatory card

**1600/3000**

And here's a card that screams synergy with them

http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Treasured_Sword_of_the_Seven_Stars

All of these Dragons are Level 7. Treasured Sword banishes a level 7 monster you control or in your hand to draw 2 cards

All of these dragons have such wordsalad effects (4 in all for each!) but they're quite similar so I'll describe all of them here:

* All Dragons can be special summoned with their own effects from the hand or graveyard by banishing 2 Dragon monsters, from the hand OR graveyard. However they can't banish themselves as part of the cost. 

* When summoned this way

* All Dragons can discard themselves and one other monster of their attribute (from the hand) to activate a certain effect:

1. **Blaster** destroys a card on the field.

2. **Tempest** adds a Dragon-type monster to your hand. (No level restriction!)

3. **Tidal** works as a Foolish Burial.

4. and **Redox** works as a Monster Reborn.

* When any of these Dragons are banished (from anywhere)

Despite having all these effects, I can't summon it right back that same turn.

So here's my thoughts for each of the dragons:

First of all, and a Suppressor Dragon after 2 turns.

**Blaster** provides a potential way to dump of dead **Fire King High Avatar Garunix** in your hand or **Volcanic Shell** to mitigate the minus

**Tempest** screams searching Dark Armed Dragon and since it is a level 7 Dragon

**Tidal**'s Foolish Burial effect DOES trigger Atlanteans in your hand (all 4 Elemental Suppressor Dragons' effects start a chain)

Don't know what to say about **Redox**. It could be splashed into Karakuris or Machina Geargia to make Rank 7s slightly easier.

* [Archetype Cards and Closing Remarks](http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/131fay/with_less_than_a_week_until_its_official_ocg/c6zy9ld)

You can click the two respective links to look at any sections that immediately interest you. There won't be any formal transitions at the end of these sections

***
***

***Anime-Influenced Cards***:

No Yugioh set would be complete without the cards feature in the (in)famous anime, adding support for the ""Syllable"" monsters he is famous for, alongside massive support for his *ZeXal Weapon* monsters. 

***
*""Syllable"" Cards:*

* **[Dododo Bot](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dododo_Bot)**
* **[Gogogo Ghost](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Gogogo_Ghost)**
* **[Gagaga Clerk](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Gagaga_Clerk)**
* **[Zerozelock](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Zerozelock)**
* **[Gagagadraw](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Gagagadraw)**

The two most notable cards from here are the pair of *Gagaga* cards. **Clerk** can Special Summon herself from the hand if you control a *Gagaga* monster

***
*Generic Yuma Cards:*

* **[Tasukerton](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Tasukerton)**
* **[Amarylease](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Amarylease)**
* **[Dimension Gate](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dimension_Gate)**
* **[Xyz Double Back](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Xyz_Double_Back)**

Normally, however, prove a bit more useful than ones seen in the past. **Tasukerton**, for example, is effectively another **Necro Gardna**, differing only, and most importantly, it wouldn't be surprising to see this card tech'd into decks such as *Lightsworns*.

**Amarylease** is also very interesting, this effect may prove more useful than what meets the eye.

***
*Zexal Weapons:*

* **[ZW - Lightning Blade](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/ZW_-_Lightning_Blade)**
* **[ZW - Tornado Bringer](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/ZW_-_Tornado_Bringer)**
* **[ZW - Ultimate Shield](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/ZW_-_Ultimate_Shield)**
* **[ZW - Lion Arms](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/ZW_-_Lion_Arms)**

These cards make using the *Zexal Weapon* archetype a whole lot more desirable

**Ultimate Shield** on the other hand present to the table a more unique effect

Finally

***

Of course

*Shark's Cards:*

* **[Spear Shark](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Spear_Shark)**
* **[Two-Head Shark](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Two-Head_Shark)**
* **[Xyz Remora](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Xyz_Remora)**
* **[Ancient Shark Hyper Megalodon](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Ancient_Shark_Hyper_Megalodon)**
* **[Xyz Dimension Splash](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Xyz_Dimension_Splash)**

Shark's cards feature basic WATER and Fish support that prove to be mildly interesting, is **Xyz Remora**, as alongside the *Mermail* archetype, it has potential for devastating chains of Xyz Summons by continually recycle cards such as **Mermail - Abysspike**, or even one of the new *Mermail* monsters, as Xyz Materials for powerful monsters such as **Bahamut Shark** or **Shark Drake**. 

***

*Vetrix's Heraldry Cards:*

* **[Heraldic Beast Basilisk](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Heraldic_Beast_Basilisk)**
* **[Heraldic Beast Eale](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Heraldic_Beast_Eale)**
* **[Heraldic Beast Twin-Headed Eagle](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Heraldic_Beast_Twin-Head_Eagle)**
* **[Heraldic Beast Unicorn](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Heraldic_Beast_Unicorn)**
* **[Heraldic Beast Leo](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Heraldic_Beast_Leo)**
* **[Reborn Heraldry](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Reborn_Heraldry)**
* **[Heraldry Change](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Heraldry_Change)**

The *Heraldic Beasts* are now becoming very reminiscent of what the *Tech Genus* archetype did in the previous era of yugioh. Recycling Xyz Materials, folks, as the **[Heraldic King](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Number_8:_Heraldic_King_Genom-Heritage)** and his **[Coat of Arms](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Number_69:_Heraldry_God_-_Coat_of_Arms)** now have their army.

*** 

*Dr. Faker's Cards:*

* **[Garbage Ogre](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Garbage_Ogre)**
* **[Garbage Lord](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Garbage_Lord)**
* **[Number 53: False-Body God Heart-eartH](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Number_53:_Fake-Body_God
* **[Number 92: False-Body God Heart-eartH Dragon](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Number_92:_Fake-Body_God_Dragon

Here we get to not only the main antagonist of the first part of the anime, of course, that **Heart-eartH Dragon** is the cover card for the entire set. While the miniature *Garbage* archetype proves to be mildly interesting, the *Number*s are what take the spotlight here, given **53**'s field presence and **92**'s field control. Their powerful effects come with matching Summoning costs, however; only time will tell if the large summoning condition of 3 Level 5 monsters will be worth the use of the *Heart-eartH* cards.

***

*Kite Support:*

* **[Orbital 7](http://goo.gl/URPY1)**

This card was somewhat out of the blue, however, as aids in summoning **Galaxy-Eyes**, alongside recycling monsters from the Graveyard.

Card Advantage is the concept of how many cards you control currently (hand and field) vs how many your opponent controls.

The modern meta-game is now almost completely based off of card advantage. How many cards I used vs. how many cards you used. If you maintain advantage over your opponent, I essentially minused two from my card advantage. Two of my monsters went to the grave, and one from my hand. If my opponent smashing grounds, I am now minus three, and my opponent is minus one. Soon, I will be topdecking, and he has advantage over me. However, I minus my opponent many times

While card advantage is not always a deciding factor in duels

1376258302.0,1k60yc,The real value of buying a JOTL box.,ownerofthewhitesudan,42,9,43,"Hi guys. I see a lot of people asking if it would be worth it to buy a box of JOTL (or a box of any set really) and I cringe inside. If you know a little about economics (I completed an economics major btw)


So what is the actual [expected return](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_return) from a box? Let's assume the pull ratios to be 5 supers per box, and 1 secret. 


So lets start figuring out what the expected values are:


We have 8 secrets


So here are the values of the secrets:

World of Prophecy: $11.49

Armades

Star Eater: $18.53

Transmodify: $17.44

Noble Knight Drystan: $11.95

Angel of Zera: $13.95

Coach Soldier Wolfbark: $29.23

Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Rooster: $53.99



This means the expected value of the secret is: $20.95



Now for Ultimates:

Star Eater: $20.99

Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory: $5.99

Number C104: Umbral Horror Masquerade: $3.49

Bujintei Susanowo: $10.45

Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force: $3.99


The expected value of the 1 ultimate is $8.98


The 2 ultras:

Bujin Yamato: $17.50

Mecha Phantom Beast Blue Impala: $3.48

Masked Chameleon: $7.44

Bujintei Susanowo: $7.49

Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force: $2.49

Shapesister: $1.93

Mecha Phantom Beast Aerosguin: $1.93

Cockadoodledoo: $3.95

XYZ Encore: $6.43

Coach Captain Bearman: $1.45


So the expected value of an ultra is $5.40 or $10.80 for both!


For the supers:

galaxy serpent: $1.35

Bujingi Quilin: $4.75

Talaya

Mecha Phantom Beast Concoruda: $1.85

HTS Psyhemuth: $1.45

Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory: $3.24

Starliege Lord Galaxion: $2.30

Number 66: Master Key Beetle: $9.95

Number C104: Umbral Horror Masquerade: $1.75

Herald of Pure Light: $1.89

Fire Formation - Yoko: $1.59

Traptrix Trap Hole Nightmare: $1.95

Fire King Avatar Yaksha: $6.96

Mist Bird Clausolas: $1.60


The expected value for a super is $3.01 or $15.05 for 5.


I've heard the chance of pulling a ghost rare is 1 out of every case or 1 out of every 12 boxes. This means the expected value of a ghost per box is the ghost's price / 12.


Star Eater Ghost is $28.97 so the expected value is 2.41.


I'm going to save some time for myself and say the average value of a rare is 50 cents. That means you net $15 from the box from rares. This is probably pretty generous since you usually can't actually sell all your rares.


Total Expected Return from Box: $20.95 + $10.80 + $15.05 + $15 + $2.41 = $64.21. This is assuming you can sell everything for the market rate right now. Honestly you probably can't sell most of the rares so you're probably looking at making closer to $50.

**A quick deck analysis**

The monster line-up is pretty standard, so that's always a plus and it keeps plenty of cards in-hand.

Monsters: 19

2x Destiny Hero - Malicious

2x Destiny Hero - Diamond Dude

2x Summoner Monk

1x Dark Grepher

1x E-Hero Stratos

3x Risebell the Star Adjuster

1x Caius

2x Effect Veiler

1x Breaker

1x Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite

1x Plaguespreader Zombie

1x Dark Armed Dragon

1x Tragoedia

Spells: 16

2x MST

Monster Reborn

Heavy Storm

2x Emergency Teleport

2x Destiny Draw

1x One Day of Peace

1x RoTA

2x Forbidden Lance

1x Pot of Avarice

1x Allure of Darkness

1x Mind Control

Traps: 6

2x Bottomless Trap Hole

1x Sol. Warning

1x Torrential Tribute

2x Call of the Haunted

Extra Deck: Here's the important part! The deck can make a ridiculous number of different Xyz summons, with Catastor, Crimson Blader, and Stardust being the MVPS for the tighty-whities. 

1x Catastor

1x Iron Chain Dragon

1x Crimson Blader

1x Stardust Dragon

1x Black Rose Dragon

1x Lavalval Chain

1x Emeral

1x Maestroke

1x Lighting Chidori

1x Gagaga Cowboy

1x Shock Master

1x Steelswarm Roach

1x Blade Armor Ninja

1x Photon Strike Bounzer

1x Constaller Ptolemy M7

To note: M7 is the serious hero of the extra deck. Why, then M7 literally acts as a graveyard search for DAD right away. It is just fantastic, and its 2700 attack puts Dracossack and the DRulers in a very precarious position. 

I currently give the deck a rating of 7.5/10: it's good

I can always use some advice

1362171691.0,19hgc9,Get Your Game On! - A Comprehensive guide to being a true HERO,HeyItsJay,47,13,39,"You probably wandered around in a vast sea of guides that don't really even constitute as a guide, welcome to the land of **HEROES**.


**Why should I play HEROES?**

Great question

* You are *righteous*

* You enjoy the notion of going **ALL OUT**

* HEROES are capable of Controlling the field &amp; going for the OTK while being consistent

* Incredible amount of Fusions &amp; XYZ

* Close to unlimited Combo Potential

* Kickass looking Artstyle

* Unbelievable top deck capability (in the case you need it)

* Endless variants (it'll keep on growing)

* Incredibly fun &amp; easy to learn though hard to master


So now that you've had some insight regarding HEROES and still wanna go through with it

**HEROES(Not Monsters)**

* **Elemental HERO Stratos**

1800/300

The Head Honcho alongside Bubbles, he's not too shabby.  Stratos is your key searcher and could be an effective backrow remover.  He can be cycled and you'd be able to use his effect to search out Bubbles and set your field with 2 XYZs &amp; a Fusion monster in the first turn (if you decide to unleash the nuts).  Regardless what HERO variant you run I highly suggest running a this bad boy.

* **Elemental HERO Neos Alius**

1900/1300

He's from space, top that off you'd be able to use him for Hero Blast because he is a normal monster!(Hero Blast/Gemini Spark are cards that I'll touch up on later).  He can be used for plenty and might just save your ass in a pinch.

* **Elemental HERO Bubbleman**

800/1200

Bubbles right here might look like a weenie, Elemental HERO Absolute Zero, Elemental HERO The Shining and much more.  This guy is what lets you unleash the nuts first turn.  Don't let the low attack fool you, his ability lets him be summoned from the hand long as he's the only one there &amp; there is a variant that makes the best use of this.  You'll be seeing him plenty and your gonna learn to love him.

* **Elemental HERO Voltic**

1000/1500

This guy is almost like a necromancer and allows for great plays.  Paired up with Fusion Gate, Attack to get the Voltic, and get your last used Fusion monster and hit him!  Even able to XYZ into a Gagaga Cowboy to burn if that's all you need.  This card is phenomenal though he doesn't see as much light as Alius, he is a completely reliable HERO and he's actually my favorite aside Burstinitrix &amp; Lady Heat(lol)

* **Elemental HERO Ocean**

1500/1200

This HERO is fairly ok(in my opinion)

* **Elemental HERO Ice Edge**

800/900

This guy is not a bad dude

* **Elemental HERO Lady Heat**

1300/1000

I love her

* **Elemental HERO Heat**

1600/1200

Uggggh

(More HEROES to be added later)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'll stop right now with the monsters and list your important Spells

**Spells**

* **Polymerization**

Great gift from god or what, it excels in Flame Heroes as you have the ability to search for it using King of the Swamp.  

* **Miracle Fusion**

Polymerization for cards in the Grave or the Field only.  This Banishes your HEROES and giving you the option to bring out and power up one of the best HEROES, pull into the Shining &amp; bam, you have a 3200 Beater that can bring back two heroes when sent to the grave. This car is the peanut butter to the Jelly of which is HEROES.

* **Super Polymerization**

Nothing says *""Fuck You""* more than using Super Poly on their Big Bad Boss Monster.  If you don't know already, this card is sooooo broke but I love it and so will you

* **Parallel World Fusion**

Having a hard time against Macro Rabbits? or anything Macro for that fact?  Fight them in their own game.  Parallel WF lets you bring out a monster from the Banished Zone into the deck and bring out a Fusion Monster.  What can they say to that?  Eat that Macro Cosmos.  Though this card isn't as strong of a top deck as Miracle, sometimes thinking is hard when all you do is beat them senseless though.

* **Fusion Gate**

The HERO deck that I started with

* **E-Emergency Call**

This is another ROTA, you have such a big range of options with this card.  Definite must have for any HERO deck.

* **Gemini Spark**

This card goes hand to hand with Hero Blast to make Alius even the more terrifying

* **Pot of Duality**

Hero Decks need to run this for maximum consistency.  No reason not to run it

* **A Hero Lives**

I enjoy running AHL as it makes it go so fast to set up.  At the cost of paying half your life-points, then you Warrior Returning Alive, Normal Stratos then you get Bubbleman again and XYZ for Excalibur, then you go Call of the Haunted on Stratos and omg I can't even continue cause this is insane!  

* **A Warrior Returning Alive**

Bring Stratos back to your hand or bring bubbleman if you need the 2 cards

* **Reinforcement of the Army**

This lets you grab a Lv4 or lower Warrior

* **Mask Change**

Heroes sometimes wanna hide their identity therefore they wear masks.  

You can chain this in battle phase and continue attacking for game or just clear the field or whatever you please!

(More to be added)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now it's time to look at the few traps that HEROES have, swoop by and kickass.  But sometimes even HEROES have a set-up or two of their own.

**Traps**

* **Hero Blast**

This only works on Normal Monsters like Avian, and *Neos Alius*!  Meaning you have a Trap Hole that brings back a monster from the grave to your hand while destroying an opposing monster with equal or less than the Attack of your targeted HERO.  Great combo with Gemini Spark.

* **Call of the Haunted**

This is a dangerous tool to use and destroy with.  You can use this to recycle Stratos and his effect to swarm your field as if your a Six Sam player.  This is how you set-up for the OTK and this is how you'll be able to rape face.  

* **Macro Cosmos**

We're not Macro Rabbits but we can definitely make use of this card to shut down an opponent.  With this up using Miracle Fusion doesn't affect you and next turn you'd be able to Parallel World Fusion to put them back in the deck.  It's a little unconventional but it definitely *can* work if you do your set-ups and your plays right.  Fighting a deck that doesn't run Macros definitely would have a tough time when they see that you can Fusion from the Banished.

* **Return from the Different Dimension**

Use it with Macro Cosmos

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's get down and dirty and talk about the Purple and Blacks.

* **Elemental HERO The Shining**

2600/2100

This guy is such a badass, Shining Gate is an example.  It abuses him in fact.

* **Elemental HERO Absolute Zero**

2500/2000

This guy is a Raigeki.  Compulse will just kill your opponents field and he sits at a steady 2500 ATK and he'll stay there.  Absolute Must(lol) this card will win you games

* **Elemental HERO Nova Master**

2600/2100

Fire Omni HERO, on top of that everytime he kills a monster you get to draw a card, what could be better?

* **Elemental HERO Gaia**

2200/2600

This guy has an awesome name and a great effect to boot.  He's able to take half the attack of an opponents monster and add it to his own

* **Elemental HERO Great Tornado**

2800/2200

This card is kind of like HERO GAIA

* **Elemental HERO Escuridao**

2500/2000

This HERO has his uses

* **Heroic Champion: Excalibur**

2000/2000

This guy uses 2 Lv4 Warriors to XYZ

* **Blade Armor Ninja**

2200/1000

Excaliburs significant other, by detaching one he can attack twice.  With a clear field he'd be able to drop your opponent to 3600 by himself.  Can you say awesome?  Yes. and you pronounce it as BAN.

* **Heroic Champion: Gandiva**

2100/1800

Gandiva is a pretty good card

* **Gagaga Cowboy**

1500/2400

This guy is a pretty kickass finisher.  Example

* **Masked HERO Acid**

2600/2100

This guy in combination with Absolute Zero can clear the field and in battle phase after he attacks go ahead and activate another Mask Change to change into Vapor to continue the onslaught of Battle. Pretty good in my opinion.

* **Masked HERO Vapor**

2400/2000

Great helping hand with Acid to finish the game.  Can't be destroyed by card effects and easily brought out by Mask Change on any phase. Generally ran with Acid only.

**I definitely know that I'm missing plenty of HERO cards

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**HEROES &amp; their variants.**

* **Bubble Beat** : (Link to Decklist here)

This variant is heavy on stunning your enemy and showing them the bubbles.  *Fairly* consistent and can get explosive.

* **Alive Hero** : (Link to Decklist here)

If you want to unleash the nuts play this.  You need 2 cards to go crazy

**EDIT: 03/02/13;1233AM.  Just got home from some drinks and food

1361982571.0,19c12j,Gravekeeper's - A Guide,GethPrime,40,6,29,"Strong against: Chaos Dragons

Weak against: Dino Rabbit

Gravekeeper's are an old archetype that cause nightmares for much of the meta. The combos are simple and effective

GK's use a three-point strategy:

1. Lock down the Graveyard with Necrovalley.
2. Stun everything your opponent does with a stupid number of traps.
3. Poke your opponent's small field with 2K beaters and Rank 4's until victory.

They run a low monster count and have tremendous draw/search power. The deck thins very quickly

**Monsters**

* Gravekeeper's Recruiter. Searches every GK monster except Spy. Use it to keep Commandants/Necrovalley in hand and thin the deck. **Run 3.**
* Gravekeeper's Spy. A huge defensive wall that you plus off of
* Gravekeeper's Commandant. Searches Necrovalley. You will almost never summon him
* Gravekeeper's Descendant. Summon him with Spy
* Gravekeeper's Assailant. A beater with a very useful effect to get over problem monsters. **Run 1**.

Do not run Visionary or Chief

**Spells**

* Necrovalley. The key to the deck. **Run 3.**
* Royal Tribute. An absolutely broken card that will ruin your opponent's day. Never fear Gorz, it's almost a guaranteed win. **Run 2.**
* Gravekeeper's Stele. Needed due to the low monster count. It combos great with Royal Tribute. Use it to bring back Commandant and get all your Necrovalley in hand. **Run 2.**
* Pot of Duality. Adds a ton of consistency
* Dark Hole. Duh. **Run 1.**
* Book of Moon. Get over problem monsters
* Wonder Wand. This is assuming no Cardcar D. Equip Recruiter to draw 2 and search. A +1 that adds some speed. **Run 1-2.**
* Forbidden Lance. Protection for you monsters

No Heavy Storm, you don't really need it (side 3, obviously). GK's win a battle of attrition.

**Traps**

Not going to go into detail here

**Extra**

Staple Rank 4's; Chimeratech; Stardust Dragon; Catastor (use Veiler to synchro in a pinch).

**Side**

Mind Control (use if they run Level 4s), Maxx C, Gozen Match/Rivalry of Warlords, Nobleman of Crossout.

**Techs**

* Effect Veiler. Clashes with Royal Tribute
* Malefic Cyber End. Huge beater. **Run 0-1.**
* Malefic Stardust. Protect dat Necrovalley. Doesn't hurt you since you attack slowly anyway. **Run 0-2.**
* Cardcar D. The Ronny build. **Run 0-2.**
* Blackwing Zephryos. Bounce Necrovalley for an easy Rank 4. **Run 0-1.**
* Genex Ally Birdman. Recycle your Spy. Opens up plays for Black Rose and Arcanite Magician. **Run 0-2.**",self,t5_2rpe6,1362017859.0,,light,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/19c12j/gravekeepers_a_guide/

**Monsters - (18)**

2x Druiz

1x Kagetokage

3x Masked Chameleon

1x Mystic Tomato

2x Summoner Monk

3x Umbral Horror Ghoul

3x Umbral Horror Unform

**Traps - (8)**

2x Bottomless Trap Hole

2x Compulsory Evacuation Device

2x Fiendish Chain

1x Solemn Warning

1x Spirit Barrier

**Extra Deck - (15)**

1x Crimson Blader

1x Scrap Dragon

1x Stardust Radiance Dragon

1x Abyss Dweller

2x King of the Feral Imps

2x Number 104: Masquerade

1x Number 16: Shock Master

1x Number 39: Utopia

1x Number 50: Blackship of Corn

2x Number 66: Master Key Beetle

2x Number C104: Masquerade Umbral Horror

Ok, is in Shadow Specters, but he's perfect for this deck. More 0 ATK/DEF support is generally good for this deck. For now, I'd run 1 more Kagetokage &amp; Tomato. Anyways, the Umbral Horror's main man is Ghoul, the only one with attack points. By losing them, you get a free Xyz monster. A 1 turn Beetle, King of Feral Imps for later Synchro plays, as well as being another Ghoul target. With Spells, as it can bring back all 3 Horrors. With Traps

With the Extra Deck, and Stardust Radiance Dragon. The first 2 are self-explanatory, Radiance will protect things and still kick ass. With the Xyzs, it's the staples, Dweller, 16, 39, you all know them. King of the feral Imps is a big player, Number 104: Masquerade. It mills your opponent, pops a backrow card when he comes out

Personal comments: I really love how the OCG is gearing more towards Synchros than Xyz Monsters now. It's nice to see Stardust and friends run in a deck again

From the looks of the Extra Deck... it seems that DDR is quite a key card

Also, and summon two tokens to use the last normal summon on our good old friend, **Blue-Eyes White Dragon**.

_ _ _

Rock Stun has been around for quite a while now; utilizing the powerful Koa'ki Meiru monsters, and Effects what Thunder King does for Special Summons (including all sporting a daunting 1900 attack), but with brand new Earth Support from *Return of the Duelist*, this deck has some new toys to play with.

New cards from these previous sets have great synergy with the Rock monsters in this deck

Today, other various techs, and throughout going over the overall playstyle of the deck.

_ _ _

**The Koa'ki Meiru Monsters**

**[Koa'ki Meiru Guardian](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/f/fb/Koa%27kiMeiruGuardianRGBT-EN-C-1E.png)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Rock/Earth/Effect

&gt; 1900/1200

&gt;     During each of your End Phases
&gt;     1 ""Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru"" from your hand to the Graveyard or
&gt;     reveal 1 Rock-Type monster in your hand. You can Tribute this card
&gt;     to negate the activation of an Effect Monster's effect and destroy
&gt;     that monster.

* The first of our *Koa'ki Meiru* monsters. One thing to note, the reveal of a Rock-Type monster is a *maintenance cost*, NOT an effect. Therefore, these monsters shouldn't be on the field unless you either plan to Xyz summon with them, or you have another Rock in your hand, which shouldn't be an issue in most builds.

* **Guardian** is arguably better than **Doomcal** because it can selectively negate monster effects

* All the *Koa'ki Meiru* monsters in this deck have the same Attack, even without using their effects.

**[Koa'ki Meiru Sandman](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/b/b5/Koa%27kiMeiruSandmanTSHD-EN-C-1E.png)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Rock/Earth/Effect

&gt; 1900/1200

&gt;     During each of your End Phases
&gt;     1 ""Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru"" from your hand to the Graveyard or
&gt;     reveal 1 Rock-Type monster in your hand. You can Tribute this card
&gt;     to negate the activation of an opponent's Trap Card and destroy that
&gt;     card.

* Trap negate is always lovely; with his effect, and can knock out the effectiveness of the majority of the opponent's backrow. Even if they try to activate **BTH**, this monster can tribute itself to be in the graveyard instead, where other cards and monsters can benefit from it.

* Along side another *Koa'ki Meiru*

**[Koa'ki Meiru Wall](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/8/8d/Koa%27kiMeiruWallSTBL-EN-R-1E.png)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Rock/Earth/Effect

&gt; 1900/1200

&gt;     During each of your End Phases
&gt;     1 ""Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru"" from your hand to the Graveyard or
&gt;     reveal 1 Rock-Type monster in your hand. You can Tribute this card
&gt;     to negate the activation of an opponent's Spell Card and destroy
&gt;     that card.

* Perhaps the best of the three *Koa'ki Meiru*s, blocking an opponent's **Reborn**, or even activating this quick effect to block **Forbidden Lance**, are all incredibly useful. It is also invaluable against *HEROs* and *Dragons*, blocking *Miracle Fusion* and *Future Fusion*.

_ _ _

Overall, means that they have incredibly synergy with each other. However, 9 negations only goes so far, especially factoring in how you draw into them. 

Before, now, for there is a new champion of Rock monsters, one that turns this impregnable fortress into an offensive behemoth to be reckoned with. Right out of *Return of the Duelist*, the newest bulwark in the Rock arsenal!

_ _ _

**[Block Golem](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/4/4c/BlockGolem-REDU-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 3

&gt; Rock/Earth/Effect

&gt; 1000/1500

&gt;     If the only monsters in your Graveyard are EARTH monsters: You
&gt;     can Tribute this face-up card to target 2 Level 4 or lower Rock-Type
&gt;     monster in your Graveyard
&gt;     those targets. This turn
&gt;     effects on the field.

* Only Earth monsters? Hm... it seems that all those *Koa'ki Meiru* monsters are Earth... in fact

* This card allows recycling of your *Koa'ki Meiru*s from the grave

_ _ _

So now we have established that this deck not only has quite extensive and versatile effect negation but can now recycle those means of negation to either serve as a beatdown, however. Outside of basic staples, there are a few specific techs that help take this deck to further heights.


(Do note that for some of the following cards
_ _ _



**[Skill Drain](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/c/c7/SkillDrain-TU08-EN-UR-UE.jpg)**

* All the Rock monsters so far have their effects resolving in the graveyard

* **Rabbit, Sangan, etc.** are all subject to **Guardian** where **Skill Drain** falls short, so, if anything, **SD** and **Guardian greatly complement each other.

* It also provides extra assurance in negation should you 'only' have access to **Sandman** or **Wall**.

**[Solidarity](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/d/d7/SolidaritySDLS-EN-C-1E.jpg)**

* This deck so far has been able to (and will continue to as I will demonstrate below) to run only Rock monsters

**[Call of the Haunted](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/9/96/CalloftheHaunted-GLD5-EN-GUR-LE.jpg)**

* A oldie, where you can chain this in your opponents turn to gain specific negation against them. (Be careful with the timing, though! You can't insert negations into chains)

* It can also revive **Block Golem**

_ _ _

These cards together make a very solid skeleton for this deck

_ _ _

**[Gogogo Giant](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/c/c1/GogogoGiant-YS12-EN-C-1E.png)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Rock/Earth/Effect

&gt; 2000/0

&gt;     When this card is Normal Summoned: You can target 1 ""Gogogo""
&gt;     monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon that target in face-up
&gt;     Defense Position
&gt;     card attacks
&gt;     Battle Phase.

* Rock? *Check.* Earth? *Check.* Benefits from Skill Drain? *Check.* Immense beater? *Double Check*

* This card brings not only extra offensive prowess to this deck (Solidarity boosts to 2800!!!)

**[Gem-Knight Pearl](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/c/ca/GemKnightPearl-BP01-EN-R-1E.png)**

&gt; Rank 4

&gt; Rock/Earth/Xyz

&gt; 2600/1900

&gt;     2 Level 4 Monsters

* The *perfect* Xyz monster to run in this deck; Solidarity boost from Rock

**[Fairy King Alverd](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/7/7a/FairyKingAlverd-REDU-JP-R.jpg)**

&gt; Rank 4

&gt; Plant/Earth/Xyz

&gt; 2300/1400

&gt;     2 Level 4 EARTH Monsters
&gt;     Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card; all
&gt;     face-up monsters currently on the field
&gt;     lose 500 ATK and DEF.

* Though not benefiting from Rock support

Woke up around 9AM expecting to be late, saw I was still early and went back to sleep. Woke up right on time at 11:30AM. Michel made spaghetti for lunch which I should have eaten right away but I made some last minute changes to my *Madolche* deck. We watched some Paranorman while I worked on  my deck. I ended up having to take it to-go in one of Jay's Sanrio Choco-Cat lunch containers. 

Jay made me drive. Someone scratched my new car. I was mad. It rained the night before so the streets were wet but since it's Texas


Inside the store, and said hello to the shop keep. ""Hello shop keep."" She's a nice lady and her daughter is really cute too. Pretty much all the guys pick on her for being really good looking, it's funny and sad to watch at the same time. Alas, sorry diary, she has a boyfriend.


**Pre-game**

Pregame consisted of perusing for trades and lending one of my friends


**Match One**

* Game one- I am matched with a little kid who is killing time during summer. His deck is... I have no idea. I plink his lifepoints fairly quickly. 

* Game two- I eat my spaghetti


Christian walks over after my first match and asks what I have in the Choco-cat container. I tell him it's some spaghetti that my sister made. He says it made him hungry.


**Match Two**

* Game one- Six samurai. It's one of the judges, Shie-En, and Kizan turn one. I can't get around the combo and scoop.

* Game two- I side in Fossil Dyna. He specials his entire hand with no ptotection. Wahaha. I drop dark hole. He scoops.

* Game three- I summon Hootcake, double United for a +4 and I don't recover from a beatdown.


**Match Three**

* Game one- I play Christian and joke that I will be needing my Lavalval chain back. He opens Lead Yoke

* Game two- I Tiaramisu his double Lead Yoke and poke for game.

* Game three- We go into time and I force the Maxx ""C"" drop. I Hootcake into Messengallato, and win. He's kinda salty but he gives me some Cina-twists from Taco Bell later for lending him a Lavalval, which I bring back for my sister to eat since she likes Cina-twists.


**Match four**

* Game one- I play a friend, triggers effect for some reason so I chain Fiendish. He overlays with M7 and attacks into Messengellatto. I swarm the field over the next few turns and manage to take game one.

* Game two- He sides in Necrovalley and activates it turn one. I luckily have Chateau in hand but overall open poorly with only Hootcake. I force a Maxx C knowing he won't special at all. My draw is dead so I use Hootcake to summon Mewfeuille

* Game three- We go into time and I start at turn zero. I look at my hand and think to myself
&gt;""After this war, have some kids, and open a bakery... That would be nice.""

I summon Hootcake, set Ultimate Offering, and set Lance. In hand... Magileine. He sets a monster and one backrow. I draw into Chateau. The perfect hand. Magileine effect, Magileine to hand, and he drops Maxx C. I take the challenge. Ultimate Offering, Magileine, XYZ into the Queen. Activate Chateau, two Magileine



**Top 8

* Game one- I play Brian

* Game two- I side in three Gozen Match and curse out my lack of Restricts. The shop keep's daughter comes over to watch the cute cards that somehow made it to the final rounds. I special Junk Warrior and tribute him for Puddingcess. He opens the Toads and suddenly has three to tribute for... Slipher. Puddincess, bro.* He passes. My next draws are dead. I start to cough up blood and drop my hand of cards on the table. ""I'm sorry childhood sweetheart... It looks like I won't be able to open that bakery with you like I promised.""

Lets talk about some pros about xyz revenge:

- Can basically shut off an Ophion if you already wasted pandemic.

**EDIT**: Does pandemic affect this card? It may not because it does not say ""Target an opponents Xyz monster that has material"" it just says ""detach 1 Xyz Material from a monster your opponent controls and attach it to that monster as an Xyz Material"" which leads me to believe it has the same ruling as [Space Cyclone](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Space_Cyclone)

- Great card to side out/in. 

- Good at stopping annoying Xyzs, that you otherwise couldn't get over. You can steal their material and equip it to something like Tiras.

- It brings back your monster with no limitations other than your opponent needing a monster with materials.

- Opens extra deck space potentially by removing Temtempo. 

- Can reborn amazing monsters like Tiras, **Dracossack**, ect.

But it does have a few weaknesses

- Can be negated by Lance/Pandemic.

- Your opponent needs an Xyz with material and you need an Xyz monster in the grave.

- It's a terrible first turn card

All in all, if I don't have any dead Xyzs, I'm either losing or winning by a lot. 

But what do you guys think about this card?

**Here is the deck**: http://imgur.com/a/3fXZX#0

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**Match 1** - Mono Mermails.

* Game 1: I got a Macro out pretty early. He made one big push but a Mirror Force stopped him cold. Win.

* Game 2: I open up with Thunder Sea Horse and a sided in Dimensional Fissure and Macro, pitches and after revealing no Heavy Infantry or Marksman, I flip Macro. He attacks and I waboku it. At the beginning of my turn, he flips a Royal Decree. I play my Dimensional Fissure and keep getting hand advantage with Thunder Sea Horse and Cobra. Win.

*Record: 1-0

**Match 2** - Fire Fists

* Game 1: I open up a ton of stun and WattCobra. He opens up with 2 Gene-Warped. After he attacks into a Mirror Force on his second turn and draws nothing on his third, I'll post a link to it!) Win.

* Game 2: He opens up great

* Game 3: I open up well, play Cobra and pass. He first turn's rabbit, which I slightly misplay and Compulsory it. I start poking for damage and then let him go. He does rabbit again, into double Warped. I'm scared he will immediately Tiger King it, but goes into the BP first and attacks, which gets D. Prison'd. End Phase the other Vanilla dies. I pretty much just start swarming with Mahunders and WattGiraffe and take game in the next two turns. Win.

*Record: 2-0

**Match 3** - Mono Mermails.

* Game 1: I open up Macro Cosmo, and MST's my Threatening Roar! Chain that immediately. I then flip Macros Cosmos. It lasted about 4 turns and he scooped. Win.

* Game 2: I'm unsure of what he is siding. First turn he sets 2 and gets Megalo and Teus out. I open up a D. Fissure, he flips Royal Decree, and I'm pretty happy. He overlays for Gaios, and trys to attack over my Cobra, but I waboku (as a clarification, I chained this to his Decree, thank you Bobnotk for catching this!) it. I draw an MST and pop his Royal Decree, and his chains his other set card

* Game 3: I side hardcore. I open up pretty well and we go toe for toe, and shakes my hand. Win.

*Record: 3-0

**Finals** - Hunder Family.
This guy is the resident pro at the locals, just because he can.

* Game 1: I open up Thunder Sea Horse with a Mahunder in hand and stall power. About as broke as can be. He goes off, but gets down to 3200 life points and scoops. Win.

* Game 2: I side out both Macro's and side in 2 Lava Golem. He also makes a small side. He goes first and gets out Thought Ruler. Oh... I use WattCobra to attack and stall. He finally gets an attack off, and sets it. I had a Lava Golem in hand, so I give it to him at the beginning of my turn, and he torrentials but I have Starlight set. Easy game from there. He gives me a big handshake and tells me he is happy that two rogue decks made it to the finals and that I played very well. I'm pretty happy. Win.

*Record: 4-0

I won $24 in store credit for first

**Pros**

* Winning

* Starliegh Paladynamo being huge!

* Blackship of Corn

* Lava Golem

* Getting drunk afterwards.

**Cons**

* Player after round 3 was pretty bitchy about my deck. Kinda got annoying.

* Another, but he didn't even top.

* Store credit instead of packs. Sigh.

[**Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon**](http://i.imgur.com/i2e26.jpg) 

*(Picture from ZeXal Episode 82; actual card artwork not released yet)*

&gt; Rank 8

&gt; LIGHT / Dragon / Xyz

&gt; 3000 ATK / 2500 DEF

&gt;     2 Level 8 Monsters
&gt;     Once per Battle Phase
&gt;     detach 1 Xyz Material from this card; negate the effects of all
&gt;     other face-up monsters on the field
&gt;     their original ATK and DEF. During your Battle Phase
&gt;     effect was used and your opponent activates a card or effect:
&gt;     This card gains 1000 ATK until the End Phase and can attack twice
&gt;     during the same Battle Phase.
***

Here's a quick breakdown of the effect

* Once per your BP

* If your opponent activates any cards or effects during your BP

Don't be surprised to see this as a new Rank 8 Xyz Staple, is also incredibly useful. This is particularly useful since it only affects monsters, meaning you are not forced to negate the effects of your own face-up Spells and Traps, like **Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon** would do. As far as not negating your opponent's face-up Spells and Traps, **107**'s second effect helps rectify this as an issue for the most part, though it can't do anything against the continuous effects of Spells and Traps.

It is important to note, it is, by its current wording, a *mandatory* effect, at least in regards to the attack bonus. While this doesn't seem like a bad thing, it can, situationally so, but the opponent's effect will still go through. This means that this card is still vulnerable to such cards as **Mirror Force**, **Magical Cylinder**. Luckily

The previous statement also holds particularly true given that the effects only occur in the Battle Phase. During the Main Phase

With all this being said, thanks to its lax summoning conditions and powerful effects in battle.

What are your thoughts

* Will this card provide competition for the Rank 8 slot that **Heliopolis** usually dominates? 
* What sorts of decks will benefit most from this card? 
* What decks/strategies would this card be most effective against?
* What potential impact could this card have in our present meta? Or a *Cosmo Blazer* meta?
* For fans of the anime

1355083896.0,14k85o,A Gamble Deck at Regionals:An Experience,Toidiedud,39,7,21,"As some of you knew or cared I took my Gamble deck to regionals.

We got there and signed in

First round starts and I go to my table

Go figure when I cut the deck and put his first hand on the bottom of his deck he draws his perfect hand. Turns out to be a variant of counter fairies

Stupidly fun time

Derping around til next round

Suddenly Dark Worlds in next round. I open up with a pro cup of ace giving him 2 more cards and he does Dark World shennanigans so not much to say there XD

Second game of it he activated my Neko Mane King but the skill drain he had goofed me up D:

He too would accept Yu-Jo if I had used it

Derping some more and then third round.

Turns out I was against one of the friends I came with, lost a paths of Destiny and it ended up he had a strong field and I narrowly avoided defeat with fairy box. 

Set a Dice Jar as a last resort

Second game was a bit more of a stomp for me oddly enough

Real disappointing to fight a friend at regionals when we duel all the time XD

Fourth Game started a bit later and was hieretics! The dude loved my deck

He won first match with Dragon Shenanigans but then we went to game two and I got out Mask of Restrict first turn to shut down most of his plays. Although I failed a cup of ace so his tragodeia was 4k strong D:

Overall though he decided to gamble against Sasuke Samurai and I just continued to poke him down. I was worried however so I decided to go all out and use Dice Jar.

I rolled a 6 so he took 6k damage for the win

Third game he got decree first turn so yeah not much to say there. Though when I showed him Yu-Jo he would not believe I was actually using it

After that me and my friends decided to drop(We were not doing well so no reason to stay for 6 more hours)but overall it was a magnificent time.

I highly suggest if you want to take a fun deck to do so

Thus the Gamble Deck at a regionals was a success.

I love this game.

So the other day I posted this in a thread about missing the timing

I would like to apologize and say that I put across some false information. So I'm just putting this out there to correct and finalize my little guide on types of effects and missing the timing.

My mistake was the part about **Sangan**

I'll make this as quick as possible

4 types of effect wording

Phrasing is the thing to look for.

1) ""If X happens; do Y""

2) ""If X happens; you can do Y""

3) ""When X happens; do Y""

None of these can miss the timing. ~~The first two~~ These three effects start a new chain when the current chain resolves. 

*edit: 1 and 3 mean the same thing but may be written differently on different cards. They are both mandatory effects and will be the first links in the new chain

~~The third one happens IMMEDIATELY when X happens. **Sangan** is phrased this way

The last kind is the type of effect that misses the timing:

4) ""When X happens; you can do Y""

What this says is ""If and only if X is the very last thing to happen

In 4

*edit: remember that only the activation of an optional effect can miss the timing.*

Greetings

Hailing from *Return of the Duelist* and *Abyss Rising*, this deck maintains a continual stream of diversity and consistency. With means to both swarm the field and manipulate it, this deck is going to be one to look out for in the next format.

Today, and traps. Then, I will be giving a brief look at techs that help this deck thrive, as well as the archetype's strengths and weaknesses. 

&gt; **THIS IS A MULTI-PART POST. THE OTHER PARTS WILL BE IN THE COMMENTS BELOW DUE TO CHARACTER LIMITS
***
***
*The Madolche Monsters*

* The monsters of the archetype can be split up into 3 distinct groups, and the Royalty. Each group has its similarities with each other that affect overall strategy and synergy with each other.

* 'The Pets, in getting monsters to the field, helping change xyz capabilities, or manipulating your opponent's field. They are all Level 3.

* 'The Servants' are the main cards of the archetype that help search the deck for other Madolche cards

* 'The Royalty' serves as the source of our deck's two 'boss' monsters, also act as key combo pieces for several of this deck's strategies.

* Practically all of these monsters sport the effect of being returned from the grave to the deck after being destroyed
***
**The Pets**:

**[Madolche Mew-feuille](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/5/56/MadolcheMillefeuille-REDU-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 3

&gt; Beast/Earth/Effect

&gt; 500/300

&gt;     When this card is destroyed by your opponent and sent to the
&gt;     Graveyard: Shuffle it into your Deck. When this card is Normal
&gt;     Summoned: You can Special Summon 1 ""Madolche"" monster from
&gt;     your hand.

* This monster is the main special summoner of the deck; able to summon any of the Madolches from your hand

* It can be used with the other 'pets' (who are all Level 3) to go into a quick Rank 3

* It is a key combo piece in one of the deck's potential OTKs

* Most builds can run up to 3 of this card

**[Madolche Mehple](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/1/17/MadolcheMouple-REDU-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 3

&gt; Beast/Earth/Effect

&gt; 0/1800

&gt;     When this card you control is destroyed by your opponent and sent
&gt;     to your Graveyard: Shuffle this card into the Deck. Once per turn:
&gt;     You can target 1 face-up Attack Position ""Madolche"" monster you
&gt;     control and 1 face-up Attack Position monster your opponent
&gt;     controls; change those targets to face-up Defense Position. Those
&gt;     targets cannot change their battle positions until the end of your
&gt;     opponent's next turn.

* This card is good defensively

* Unfortunately, if at all*, due to search-ability in order to selectively activate the effect.

**[Madolche Croiwassant](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/b/bf/MadolcheCroiwanssant-ABYR-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 3

&gt; Beast/Earth/Effect

&gt; 1500/1200

&gt;     When this card is destroyed by your opponent's card (either by
&gt;     battle or by card effect) and sent to the Graveyard: Shuffle this
&gt;     card into the Deck. Once per turn: You can target 1 other face-up
&gt;     ""Madolche"" card you control; return that target to the hand
&gt;     you do

* This card has the potential to become a very surprising beater in this deck

* Croiwassant can return any Madolche card you control, the Field Spell which has practically no consequence to return to the hand.

* Crucial in recycling monsters via the field spell (how will be covered shortly), this card should be run at 3 in the majority of builds.
_ _ _

**The Servants**:

**[Madolche Majoleine](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/5/58/MadolcheMajoleine-REDU-JP-R.jpg)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Spellcaster/Earth/Effect

&gt; 1400/1200

&gt;     When this card is destroyed by your opponent and sent to the
&gt;     Graveyard: Shuffle it into your Deck. When this card is Normal or
&gt;     Flip Summoned: You can add 1 ""Madolche"" monster from your Deck
&gt;     to your hand.

* This deck's predominate searcher

* This card's effect is a *VERY* surprising move by Konami. Unlike other searchers

* This card is a *must* at 3 in any sensible build.

**[Madolche Chouxvalier](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120413222733/yugioh/images/4/4c/MadolcheChouxvalier-REDU-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Warrior/Earth/Effect

&gt; 1700/1300

&gt;     When this card is destroyed by your opponent and sent to the
&gt;     Graveyard: Shuffle it into your Deck. Your opponent cannot target
&gt;     other face-up ""Madolche"" monsters you control for attacks.

* This card is the strong stat-wise of the servants

* Chouxvalier is one of the potential cards that can take place in one of the deck's OTKs

* Though good for protection and power

* He is unnecessary for the deck

**[Madolche Butlerusk](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/f/f2/MadolcheButlerusk-REDU-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Spellcaster/Earth/Effect

&gt; 1500/800

&gt;     When this card is destroyed by your opponent and sent to the
&gt;     Graveyard: Shuffle it into the Deck. When this card is Normal
&gt;     Summoned
&gt;     can add 1 Field Spell Card from your Deck to your hand.

* Butlerusk is a very reliable searcher for the field spell

* The utility of the Madolche field spell is significant enough to warrant this card's use

* Because of the importance to our field spell in the deck's offensive prowess and recycling

**[Madolche Marmamaid](http://images.wikia.com/yugioh/images/2/2d/MadolcheMarmamaid-ABYR-JP-C.jpg)**

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Spellcaster/Earth/Effect

&gt; 800/2000

&gt;     When this card is destroyed by your opponent's card (either by
&gt;     battle or by card effect) and sent to your Graveyard: Shuffle this
&gt;     card into your Deck. When this card is flipped face-up: You can
&gt;     target 1 ""Madolche"" Spell/Trap Card in your Graveyard; add that
&gt;     target to your hand.

* The archetype bolsters many traps and key spells that help make this deck what it is.

* It is a lot harder to recycle the spells

* This being said

&gt; Level 4

&gt; Warrior/Earth/Effect

&gt; 1600/1000

&gt;     When this card is destroyed by your opponent (either by battle or
&gt;     by card effect) and sent to the Graveyard: Shuffle this card into the
&gt;     Deck. When this card is Special Summoned
&gt;     Beast-Type ""Madolche"" monster: You can add 1 ""Madolche""
&gt;     Spell/Trap Card from your Deck to your hand.

* The 2nd best searcher in the deck behind Majoleine. Used with Mew-feuille, including the field spell. This doesn't render Butlerusk as irrelevant, however, as they both gain their effects under different circumstances.

* 2-3 in builds with Mew-Feuille

1336963359.0,tlv64,I'm going to start a weekly r/yugioh tournament! [Includes real Prizes] Details inside!,AaronCarver,43,12,115,"NOTE: SIGN-UPS FOR MAY 19th IS UP

**Weekly /r/yugioh Tournament**

Hello! My name is Aaron Carver, and usually are just a one-time thing. I look to change this by making a official /r/yugioh tournament. Here's how it's going to go:

**Where

**Where**

This tournament is going to take place on the website as everyone knows as DN

**When**

I will be hosting the tournaments every **SATURDAY @ 6PM PST** (Pacific Standard time). Please find out what time that is in your time zone if you decide on joining!

**How**

As I said before, I will have a **sign up post every sunday** , and all you have to do is **post your DN username and your skype username.** I will be having the brackets on the site challonge. I created a subdomain for the tournaments on challonge. You can find it [here](http://ryugioh.challonge.com/).

**Prizes and Rules**

**Rules**

* This will be a TCG tournament
* BE ON TIME FOR THE TOURNAMENT. If you are not online on DN and/or Skype 15 minutes after the 1st round starts [6:00 PM PST] You will be disqualified. (This is to ensure speed of tournament and so others do not have to wait.
* No cheating whatsoever
* Have a good time

**Prizes**

Heres how the prize system is going to work. I will be in charge of them myself. If you win a tournament

**Duel Coins System**

* &amp;amp;lt;5 Participants: For fun :)
* 5-11 Participants: 1 Duel Coin
* 12-16 Participants: 2 Duel Coins
* 17-21 Participants: 3 Duel Coins
* 22-26 Participants: 4 DCs
* 27-32 Participants: 5 DCs

Note: 32 participants is the max for one tournament as of right now. If you want to join

Each Duel coin is worth 1 USD each. You may redeem them for **PAYPAL CASH** at anytime after you have won. Paypal will be used to ensure that everyone (internationally) can play and win money as well. It also is safer and faster than cash in the mail (and can be confirmed by other members) 

**Conclusion**

Well, feel free to ask in the comments or in a pm. MAY 19th 2012 will be our official first tournament. I will post a sign-up thread tomorrow if I get enough support for this. Thanks for reading.

**tl;dr: Setting up a weekly tournament on DN. Win cash prize from tournament. Post below if you want to see this happen**

EDIT: Changed time from 7PM PST to 6PM PST
EDIT 2: Due to the large amount of people interested in this
EDIT 3: Changed my position in the tournament
