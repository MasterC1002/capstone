a hobby of mine is taking my GW2 screenshots and making them more dynamic and/or eye popping. 

here are some test ones i did using various gameclient graphic settings. some are using WvW settings and i forgot to switch it back to higher settings.

--- so last night i was in the Hidden Garden area jumping puzzle helping my GF with the puzzle. i figured it was the perfect place to take some action screenshots of my character while she completed the puzzle. ...but this happened instead.

**Warrior**
You might've seen a lot of warriors running around with a bunch of signets equipped and using greatswords. That's because it's the best build! Signets are **always** useful, the best defense is a good offense.

**Ranger**
A fine class for players of true finesse. True to the class' name, you'll do more damage!

**Mesmer**
See above regarding knockbacks. Also

**Thief**
All you need to know is that if you're doing well

**Guardian**
Two words: Autistic Healing. Just buy some berry pies, the more signets the better. You don't want to be distracted from that intense action combat by having to deal with pesky utility skills, after all.
