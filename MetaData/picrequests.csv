Seriously Reddit, thanks to everyone who shared their story with me. I really appreciate it. At a time when I felt pretty fucking alone, you made me feel less so. Thanks Reddit!

Hi Reddit
I realize I'm opening myself up to a world of additional pain here... but I'm hoping Reddit will continue to demonstrate that not everyone is terrible.
To make a long sad story a shorter one
So Reddit... can you possibly pick two photo's and make it appear as though we're actually in them together? I realize this is a difficult mission. I also realize that by posting as many photos as I have of myself and my father on the internet, or something entirely atypical (although hopefully not hateful/offensive).

Tragically, I can provide further if its not enough). This year has been really rough on my grandma and know that if she could have that one family portrait, it would be something she could cherish forever as she has never had her full family together.

I don't want it to be a blatant picture of his face though... Maybe try outlining his head, or create a silhouette out of his head/face, making the text the main focus of the memorial. Do it in a way that his presence is still noticeable in the design, if that makes any sense. Minimal, clean and legit!

This bothers me a little.  Photoshop is a tool to create art.  Those who use it are artists (at varying skill levels).  you wouldn't say: ""i don't have paint, in a field you know nothing about.

I believe that a note to this effect would be a good addition to the sidebar or posting page.

My niece, or Edward's syndrome. This disorder left her with seizures, a hole in her heart, and a lot of other issues. The most noticable effect of this disease has been her feeding and oxygen tubes.

Brooklyn passed away this morning. I was wondering if anyone would be willing/able to Photoshop away these tubes in some pictures of her. I think it would mean a lot to them to have some pictures without these tubes. You can find some pictures below

Later we arrived in Vegas and she was too sick to get out of the camper so I just drove up and down the strip for a couple of hours and let her look out the windows.

We're moving in a few weeks and went through his storage locker and found loads of old photos that he's hid away for years because he's ""stealth"" or not out as trans at work or to the majority of our friends/my family. However! I'd like to put up some of these photos alongside the ones from my childhood. 

So

There are six photos in **[this album](http://imgur.com/a/aDlky)**. I've ranked them in order of how much I'd like to have them done. 

The first three are pictures from him as an infant. He's wearing pink clothes. I'd love to have them re colorized to blue or green. 

The fourth photo is a baseball photo. He looks fairly male

The last two he has long effeminately cut hair. I'm not sure if it's possible to realistically give him a masculinized hair cut

Final note: Yes! He knows I'm doing this. He actually did the scanning ;)

Go to your local library and ask for help. Tell the person that you want the photo scanned at the highest quality so that it can be restored. Also scanning a photo is probably free.

It really is VERY important to get a high quality photo when you scan. If you want to preserve or fix a photo isn't worth doing well? It is also the least you can do for the people wanting to fix the photo. Restoring photos professionally is VERY expensive so those of us fixing photos are essentially losing quite a bit of money when we restore a photo for free.

We do this out of the goodness of our hearts. We want to help you and we want to give you a great product at the end but a great product starts with you.

My cat Jones, and I hope none of you ever did.

I got Jones when he was four days old. I had just been released from the hospital and I felt that I had no real will to live. Taking care of Jones gave me purpose. He changed my life completely... Without him I would be a very different person today. I am a much poorer person now. I love him with all my heart and owe him everything.

And now he's gone. In a few minutes the man will arrive to take him to be buried and he'll be gone from my life forever.


I love you

You see, and eventually to me owning my own business (I'm a dog boarder). I really do owe him everything.

So Reddit, but I went over all my old photos of him and found a bunch of pictures where you can see the bottom of his foot. Ideally I want his front paw, but beggars can't be choosers.

* Tag your requests, [Offer], or [Help].


* **Thank the people that help you and toss them an upvote.**


* When you make a request


* **Tag NSFW posts as such!**


* Do **not** always expect free work. Many people still honing their skills will help you


* **WE WILL NOT FORGE DOCUMENTS


*****

**Please note the second rule here.** Remember to thank people that help you. [This post sums it up pretty well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/picrequests/comments/mwujl/scumbag_pic_requesters/) People spend time on your requests and feel unappreciated when you don't take the time to thank them.

Another problem we have been having is people trying to embarrass people or make offensive requests. **We aren't going to edit your ex-girlfriend's picture so you can black mail the person.** That is wrong. 


**PLEASE REPORT THESE KINDS OF POSTS.**

My wife's grandmother (Nana Joyce) is 89 years old. She's an absolutely wonderful woman who we love very much. She has a framed set of two pictures that she treasures. I was thinking it would make for an amazing gift for her if they were able to be colourized/touched up. I know it's asking a lot

The first picture is one of Nana's mother and her brother Frank. I'm not sure exactly when the picture was taken

**Image 1** JPG - [http://db.tt/O6gb5lrL](http://db.tt/O6gb5lrL)

The second picture in the frame is of Frank's grave. He was killed by a German sniper in Heverlee Belgium

**Image 2** JPG - [http://db.tt/WgMyTWJ5](http://db.tt/WgMyTWJ5)

The first image is about 3.5x4.5 inches in size, and TIF). I set up a Dropbox containing both pictures in each of the 3 formats (so 6 pics in total).

**Dropbox (JPG

Again, what I would LOVE is the first photo in colour and restored, and the second photo restored (and the colour blotch on the right side of the image removed). If the resolution is high enough, I'd like to enlarge them to 5 by 7 inches, but understand if that's not a possibility. If that's not possible, maybe 4 by 6 inch would be?

**The story behind the picture:**

Every year for Halloween my dad would dress up in the mask and gloves and just sit on the front porch. The bowl of candy would rest in his lap. Most kids were terrified of him (he was 6'3"" and weighted around 230) but my mom would comfort them, and grunt or shift his hands when they got close, scaring them to death. Many, many kids would run away screaming.

After a few years word got around our small town and the local newpaper took this picture and ran the story.

Any help you guys could offer is greatly appreciative.

http://i.imgur.com/paj0Tvt.jpg

The story behind the pic (from my wife): 

Kevin died April 5, Kevin's kidneys failed and shortly after his leukemia returned.  Aside from that, a mystery illness kept him in ICU for 4 months while each major organ system failed one after another. He was put on a respirator and drug induced coma. 

April 4, the bank approved their offer to purchase the home. Kevin couldn't talk at this point due to complications and signed the symbol for a house to his wife. He put that symbol to his heart and then pushed his hands to her heart. Less than a day later, April 5, 2013, he died. While going through his belongings, his widow discovered this photo - it's the last photo of them before Kevin's first bout of illness. It's wallet sized. She didn't know he kept it all these years and her wish is to have a larger version framed in their home in NC. She just officially closed on the home April 19, 2013

* Personally
* I use a very large size (&gt;50) and nearly always have the edge set to 100.
* Moving the source so it's not always the same distance and angle helps avoid that repeated look.
* (Especially if you're looking to re-create an edge) Don't be afraid to find a spot in the image that's similar, rotate, skew, and erase until it blends well.
* Often I find Photoshop is overkill for what needs to be done

UPDATE: Sorry for taking so long...  I ended up using wweerrddUP's pic because my boss texted me early asking if everything was ok. I played it slow and just texted him that I was sorry and that someone rear ended me and that I'll pay the deductible, when etc. but I could tell it started to sink in because his voice got depressed. after about 5 mins of going over the story I told him I had to talk to the cops and hung up. I called him back 5 mins later and he sounded so quite and upset that I thought it would be mean to let it go any longer. I eventually bursted out laughing with my other coworker in the car and told him that it was a prank... he didn't get it, and just sounded confused until I told him that I had someone had Photoshop'd the picture of his car. He took it well but he'll probably get me back

He's not very versed in image editing and when I asked he said that Paint is the only thing he can really understand. 

I scanned his original ""master"" copy (with his permission) because a while ago I told him I would try to make an editable version. I tried

**Basically what I'm asking for is an outline of the land borders that he can then edit and play around with in Paint.** I'm sure from there he can figure out how to add city locations and such. His birthday is in 10 days and I know this would be the perfect gift for him. 

Thanks for reading all of this! I'm not even sure if this is possible

ONE: A person/s who loves comic books and is familiar with ""sound effects"" in text form. ""Bam!"" or ""Krak!"" or ""Crunch!"" and would like to come on board to help create a decent amount of them to be composited into the film itself. 

TWO: Anyone interested in basic sky replacement. I'd ideally like to give you a frame where you would then add buildings into the background where there was an empty sky (I have plenty of building images). I would then track the footage and composite them into the film myself.

Im hoping someone with the skills could spell it out with realistic looking stars. My plan would be to get it printed on transparent paper/plastic and put on the end of the telescope (glass removed.) The diameter of the lens is 2.5 inches. So that would be the ideal size.

Thanks so much to anyone who can help!

This can be accomplished by any means at your disposal but it’d be really cool if you could actually print Shadow out and take a genuine photo at some landmark nearby but this isn’t required.

Now, I was hoping that the awesomeness that is reddit would be able to help out and do some kind of apocalyptic addition to a fantastic photo of a much-loved brother. Thanks so much!
