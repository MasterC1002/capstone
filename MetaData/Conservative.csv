These ridiculous, reducing the size of government and getting the country moving in the right direction again.  We're now going to have a week - the week before the convention - where Romney and Ryan are going to have to field questions about what some dumbasss in Missouri said.  And after the convention, they'll likely be responding to something similar since they've foolishly given Santorum a speaking spot at the convention.

I know it won't happen, they should champion those fiscal policies and disassociate themselves, and the Party, from the social lunacy the emanates from the other wing of the Party.  They should go so far as to remove any anti-abortion, anti-gay, anti-muslim, anti-anything from the official party platform for the convention.

This election was incredibly close in the popular vote. There are a lot of people on our side already. Beating an incumbent made it all the more difficult to win the Presidency. I don't think the answer lies in turning our values to whatever is popular at the moment.

Personally

We always try to take the high road, we need to push back instead of continuing to always be pushed.

Just my thoughts here, encourage conservatives to get out and vote, and put our ideas out there more.

1) Only in America could politicians talk about the greed of the rich at a $35

2) Only in America could people claim that the government still discriminates against black Americans when they have a black President

3) Only in America could they have had the two people most responsible for our tax code, BOTH turn out to be tax cheats who are in favor of higher taxes.

4) Only in America can they have terrorists kill people in the name of Allah and have the media primarily react by fretting that Muslims might be harmed by the backlash.

5) Only in America would they make people who want to legally become American citizens wait for years in their home countries and pay tens of thousands of dollars for the privilege while we discuss letting anyone who sneaks into the country illegally just 'magically' become American citizens.

6) Only in America could the people who believe in balancing the budget and sticking by the country's Constitution be thought of as ""extremists.""

7) Only in America could you need to present a driver's license to cash a check or buy alcohol

8) Only in America could people demand the government investigate whether oil companies are gouging the public because the price of gas went up when the return on equity invested in a major U.S. oil company (Marathon Oil) is less than half of a company making tennis shoes (Nike).

9) Only in America could the government collect more tax dollars from the people than any nation in recorded history

10) Only in America could the rich people who pay 86% of all income taxes be accused of not paying their ""fair share"" by people who don't pay any income taxes at all.

Full speech pasted from /r/politicaldiscussion:

""We’ve already made a trillion dollars’ worth of cuts. We can make some more cuts in programs that don’t work
There are a lot of wealthy, if you’ve been successful, you didn’t get there on your own. You didn’t get there on your own. I’m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something – there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.
If you were successful
The point is, but also because we do things together. There are some things, just like fighting fires, we don’t do on our own. I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service. That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires.
So we say to ourselves, there are some things we do better together. That’s how we funded the GI Bill. That’s how we created the middle class. That’s how we built the Golden Gate Bridge or the Hoover Dam. That’s how we invented the Internet. That’s how we sent a man to the moon. We rise or fall together as one nation and as one people, and that’s the reason I’m running for president – because I still believe in that idea. You’re not on your own, we’re in this together.”




There's plenty of emotional sentiment here. In his speech President Obama makes a heartfelt case with lots of emotions, about how the government created the internet so that ""the companies can make money off [it]."" (Not true, but never mind that.) And how we all had that special teacher somewhere in life. But what is he *really* saying? It could be a number of things. 

**A)** If we take his speech literally, either, since everyone both is and isn't. (The Business owner didn't build it. Then who did? Everyone? But not the business owners, apparently.) Taking the literal approach makes no sense due to the ambiguity of the entire speech. 

**B)We are indebted to society insofar as infrastructure is concerned.** But again, to acquire capital means to pay taxes, therefore this man has been funding infrastructure. Now, either Obama wishes to have this man fully fund all infrastructure in the country or his community by his lonesome, or he is saying that this man has not been paying taxes. By rejecting the former and accepting the latter, this argument cannot work unless the President assumes no business owner has ever paid taxes in his life--he is an equal contributor and thus ""owes"" nothing to anyone. 

**C) Obama spoke stupidly, except diplomacy or succinctness. 

**D)** My personal favorite: Obama is lying and does not actually mean any of that at all.

These are the only four positions an Obama devotee can take. They are all terrible. Any objective reading of his speech will show that none of his statements are out of context, and delivered with clarity. 

**What Obama Really Meant.**

I'm not going to psychoanalyze him, but carefully premeditated. By saying that the community is also responsible, and not the business owner, it gives unsuccessful people a sense of pride and accomplishment. Now, I'm not attacking the character of those less successful at all, I'm demonstrating why people would want to hear this. President Obama carefully sets the narrative by juxtaposing tax increases on the wealthy, with optimal government spending--the moon landing, the Golden Gate bridge. (I believe which was built by state funding, I'm responsible for your businesses too!, he has been able to make Americans extremely receptive to tax increases and their impact towards his reelection.

DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS JUST BECAUSE YOU DISAGREE WITH THEM. No matter how stupid you might think they are

Reddit is successful due in large part to this great voting system that it has. But what happens to downvoted comments? They become less visible, stale, a boring circlejerk, and these subs become far less fun to visit. I want to hear the controversial opinions, they're the interesting ones. Don't downvote them. If you really don't like what's being said, just leave the comment alone. Or you could upvote anything that makes the conversation better, regardless of if you agree with it. Karma does matter. Not for the individuals but for the conversation as a whole

Hey guys, and typed this up. Please tell me what you think, and feel free to spread it around if you think it will make a difference. Thanks.

Imagine that you’re a law abiding, and have a significant amount of money invested in. You use your vehicle every day for lawful purposes, and you could not imagine life without it. You try to never break traffic laws, and you never drive while intoxicated. In fact, you’ve gone out of your way to ensure that if you’re going to be at a party or a bar where you may be drinking, you get a ride, carpool, and you have never made the mistake of drinking and getting behind the wheel.
One day, and tries to drive himself home. On the way, he runs a red light and hits a minivan with a young family of five inside, on the way to their vacation home not too far away. No one survives the accident, including the drunk driver. The accident is highly publicized, with political leaders and the media calling for stricter laws to prevent this sort of thing in the future. The debate rages on for weeks, with each side becoming more and more vocal.
A few weeks later after you drive home from work, and according to the media, will save lives at only the cost of a few inconveniences.
The new law requires all cars manufactured to come with a built in blood alcohol content interlock, and may not be capable of exceeding 55 miles per hour. This of course is to both reduce the severity of potential future incidents, and to reduce the ability of intoxicated drivers to flee from the police. The police and government of course do not have to abide by these arbitrary limits, and the politicians who passed this ban have specially licensed chauffeurs allowed to own performance vehicles with high capacity fuel tanks. The last portion of the ban on vehicles specifies a list of features that a vehicle may not have. These include traction control, spoilers, air scoops, dual exhausts

“Well” you think, at owner expense. The interlock must be inspected and registered with the state, and recertified every five years, with a fee each time. This applies to all vehicles, regardless of the owner’s driving history, and the fact that you’ve gone out of your way and spent extra money in the past to comply with the existing laws. Vehicles currently owned are also not allowed to be sold within the state. When you decide to dispose of your current vehicle, you must sell to an out of state buyer, without compensation. You also may not give it to your child for their first vehicle. Your high capacity fuel tank is now banned. Even though the tank was the standard capacity when the vehicle was manufactured, and pay a fee every time you fuel your vehicle. In addition, you were unknowingly in violation
After you hear all this on the news, taxpaying, law abiding driver, are being treated like a common criminal. You’ve gone out of your way to comply with the former DWI laws, but now they’re treating you as a scapegoat.

1. Yes it is about the First Amendment.  No, *after the election was already over*.  The message is clear - if you disagree with gay marriage then you will find your personal life spread all over the Internet, and possibly even crazies showing up at your door, disrupting your personal life (or possibly even worse).  There was a similar effort in Washington State.  The clear intent is to intimidate and silence the opposition, which is absolutely contrary to the spirit of the First Amendment, if not the letter.  A mere boycott against Chick Fil A isn't at the same level of intimidation as publicly revealing home addresses of Proposition 8 supporters, but it will escalate to that level if it isn't stopped now.  It is not inconceivable for activists to be jotting down license plate numbers at Chick Fil A restaurants and then publicly posting them online for the world to see.  Chilling?  You bet and that is the whole idea.  And don't tell me that gay rights activists are opposed to those tactics

2.  Yes it is about Christianity.  If you listen only to the gay marriage crowd, being a homosexual doesn't mean discrimination, it means death.  Where are the outraged protests over Saudi Arabia's criminalization of sodomy?  Or the [persecution in the Palestinian Authority of gays](http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Persecution_of_Homosexuals_%28Palestinian_Authority_area%29), who would rather flee to Israel and be under house arrest, than stay in Palestine?  No, instead, we have ""Queers for Palestine"" and ""Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism"".  Combine this double standard with the common leftist stereotype of evangelical Christians in the first place - either ignorant redneck hayseeds, and might come to the conclusion that protests in favor of gay marriage

3. The gay marriage supporters have much more in mind than just changing the definition of marriage.  They want to change the definition of ""good person"".  In their eyes it does not matter one bit how much other good works a person does - if that person doesn't support gay marriage, who do more charitable acts and contribute more to charity than most other groups.  BUT NONE OF THIS MATTERS TO THE GAY MARRIAGE CROWD.  They seek to impose a litmus test on what constitutes a good person, based on adherence to leftist ideology.  This isn't really anything new, as leftists all the time are declaring that if you don't support tax increases that are *intended* to pay for wealth redistribution to the poor, that it means that you are a cruel selfish heartless bastard.  This is just one more data point that to the left, one's moral worth stems from one's political views, and not from one's faith or one's personal actions.  Who is the better person - the guy who votes in favor of gay marriage but spends every weekend playing video games,,False,t3_xvlzl

Most of the time I'm fairly quiet over here.  My opinion is that I'm a guest

&gt;Seems like this thread is full of people disputing the incorrect and inaccurate statements of the article. They are disputing the lies and errors with facts.
They are not trolls. Trolls don't care about facts. Neither do conservatives

The first part is valid.  The last sentence throws all credibility out the window.  I think it is important that everyone check their viewpoint.  Name calling doesn't help.  I really like that I can come here and read a different opinion.  Heck

NOTE: I've done a lot of this by manual qualitative analysis taken from the steps below

1. From May 29th, therefore the most measurable effect. It's like the 4 year storm you've been waiting to surf. 

2. Compares total number of times a candidates name is used to measure selective or preferential reporting. 
Variables include an inflexion point for overly liberal or conservative media who use their opponents name more in stories while attacking them.

3. Measures use of candidates name paired with inflammatory or condescending key words and measures candidates names paired with key words of praise or encouragement. 

4. Takes author's political backgrounds and previous job experience associated with liberal or conservative (lowest weight in measurement since backgrounds don't always indicate reporting bias)

5. Collect information from recent studies about media bias that categorizes known biases for mass media. Also includes statements made by the media themselves about their viewpoint.

6. If any, audience reaction of articles and shows for a majority conservative or liberal bias. In keeping with premise that the majority of people hold a confirmation bias and loyally follow and comment on media that matches their beliefs.

**ROMNEY:** ...But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere. Nothing could be further from the truth.

I'm a son of Detroit. I was born in Detroit. My dad was head of a car company. I like American cars. And I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry. My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks. It was President Bush that wrote the first checks. I disagree with that. I said they need — these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy. And **in that process

And fortunately...

**ROMNEY**: You can take a look at the op-ed...

---------------------------------------------

From the [""Let Detroit Go Bankrupt"" opinion article](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/opinion/19romney.html?_r=0)

 The American auto industry is vital to our national interest as an employer and as a hub for manufacturing. A managed bankruptcy may be the only path to the fundamental restructuring the industry needs. It would permit the companies to shed excess labor

1324604418.0,nndi2,Users are getting banned for being pro Ron Paul (proof inside),Jibrish,159,56,73,"I've been on the non pro-paul side of this argument but I don't tolerate censorship.

I was in the middle of a discussion with [go1lfish](http://www.reddit.com/user/go1dfish) when he was abruptly banned. This is going even further than what was announced. Am I to be banned now to even though I wish Ron Paul fans would tone it down a bit on submissions? What is this even about now anyways? Here's the message from go1dfish trying to continue the discussion we were having.

&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/nmsj1/can_we_have_peace_between_the_paul_and_antipaul/c3afi3v
I would reply directly
I chose the term ""War"" as the antonym of ""Peace"".
The sub-reddit was relatively peaceful and cordial before the mods decided to ban comments about politicians they don't like.
If you are still able to post

[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/paleoconservative/comments/nnc54/rconservative_isnt_just_banning_posts_theyve/) is a thread in paleoconservative about this. I agree that go1dfish was a bit inflammatory but was a ban really justified in this case? We're conservatives. We don't like uncle sam telling us what to do - why should we like a mod doing so?

For the record I do agree that there are too many ron paul posts and very few places for conservatives who don't actively support Paul to go on reddit but damn. All of what he was posting appeared to me to be in the context of what was going on in the sub reddits.

**EDIT: http://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/ is now a public subreddit. Thanks ZachRB87!**


Fuck this shit. Let's make a new subreddit shall we? I propose /r/Conservativepolitics. I'll gladly pass mod rights to whoever is up to the task.
