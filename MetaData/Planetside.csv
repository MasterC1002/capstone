###General
* Aim at enemies and press ""Q"" to spot them
* If you aim at a friendly player and press ""Q""
* You can also keep Q pressed down to open the ""commo rose"" that allows you to interact with the targeted person in various ways.
* Do not destroy enemy terminals when attacking. Let infiltrators hack them instead.
* Find a squad/platoon and roll with it. You are unlikely to do much or survive long alone.
* Fight in a group
* One way to find an outfit (a guild) is using the [r/ps2outfits](http://www.reddit.com/r/ps2outfits) subreddit.
* You passively gain certs even when you are offline at a rate of 2 certs every 6 hours for 48 hours after last login. 
* Unlocked attachments are weapon specific.
* You can not shoot in to hostile spawn rooms.
* You can shoot out from a spawn room.
* Do the math on the two above points (Hint: Them shooting you while you can't shoot back is usually quite bad).
* Weapons in this game are **sidegrades**, but being much worse in medium to long ranges.
* When you unlock attachments or upgrades
* Pressing H toggles a bigger minimap view. The enlargened minimap blocks the capture process indicators.
* You can press ALT to enable and disable a mouse cursor when ingame. Use it to switch chat views.

###Infantry
##General
* Do not run on roads. Those tank drivers can't really see well and rarely can stop in time to avoid running over you.
* Just like you were told to as a kid: look both ways before crossing.
* You can **not** equip both nanoweave and improved shields at the same time. You should choose one and focus on it. Same applies to all slots.
* Let the medic heal you to full health after he has revived you.
* You do **not** take damage when dropping from a galaxy dropship.
* All small arms (even pistols) do damage to fighters. Shoot at them to scare them away
* The knife (T) two-shots all non-MAX infantry. Use it on unaware enemies to save ammo.
* Your very first cert should be spent on Nanoweave Armor. It gives +10% health for **1** cert.
* You unlock the Spawn Beacon from the Command certification tree. The certification requires Battlerank 10.
* Never run over vehicle spawn points. You are just asking to be squished under a spawning sunderer.
* Flashlights on weapons only act as a giant ""shoot me"" -sign.
* Most weapons require burst firing to be effective.
* You can switch fire modes (single shot

##Light Assault
* Use your speed and agility to strike from unexpected angles. Going head-to-head is usually a bad idea.
* Your jump jets automatically activate when you keep space bar pressed down.
* Using your jump jets when dropping from a galaxy (even for a split second) removes the fall damage immunity from you.
* C4 is extremely powerful against turrets

##Medic
* Friendlies you revive come to life with reduced health. Heal them back up before carrying onwards.
* You can not heal a wouded MAX unit.
* You can revive a MAX unit that has been killed.
* The medic's ability is an Area of Effect (AoE) heal that affects all nearby friendlies. Use it when it does the most good for both you and your friends.

##Engineer
* You can heal (repair) a wounded MAX unit.
* Always drop ammo near Heavy Assaults that are firing rockets. They need it bad and you get tons of points.
* You can replace the ammo box on your loadout and still give out ammo by equiping the turret and pressing B (change fire mode).
* Deployed turrets can act as cover for friendlies

##Heavy Assault
* Shooting at the rear of a vehicle does insane amounts of damage. You can two-shot a main battle tank by shooting at it's rear with the default launcher.
* Your shields also negate damage suffered from dropping.
* The default rocket launcher does most pure damage. The anti-air launcher does least damage. The anti-tank lock-on launcher sits right between the two.
* Both lock-on launchers need three rear hits against a main battle tank. The default destroys it with two.

##Infiltrator
* Hack **all** the things! Every hacked terminal is free exp for you
* Shift steadies your aim for a moment when using a scope.
* Hacking an occupied turret forces the (confused) enemy out of it.
* Cloak is not an invisibility: you are only harder to see. You are easier to see when moving than when immobile.
* Do not play like a sniper
* You can not be healed when cloaked.
* IRNV scopes see cloaked people just fine.
* You can not fire while cloaked.
* Enemies can not spot you with Q when you are cloaked.
* If you have been spotted by an enemy (with Q)
* Consider cloaking into an enemy held base

##MAX
* Wait for a few seconds if you die: a friendly medic can revive you!
* **Everyone** starts with a single Anti-Air Buster on their MAX loadout. Use this if you need AA and there is nothing better available.
* When doing Anti-Air duty
* You can use the MAX units charge ability (F) to quickly move from place to place. Great for getting closer to enemies
* Switching out of the MAX suit invokes the acquisition timer.
* You can

###Vehicles
##General
* Setting a vehicle to ""squad/platoon"" allows your squad/platoon mates to drive the vehicle.
* You can use the Vehicle Management menu (Page Down) to lock a vehicle down (only you can enter) or to only allow people in squad/platoon to enter.
* All vehicle weapons have a 1 cert each upgrade for basic ammo capacity and added zoom.
* HE = High Explosive. Great against infantry. Less effective against heavy armor.
* HEAT = High Explosive Anti Tank. Great against light armor
* AP = Armor Piercing. Great against heavy armor. Less effective against infantry.
* You can use cruise control with vehicles to make them go forward without having to press any buttons. Press the = key to enable and disable cruise control.
* Use the function keys (F1-F12) to change seats in a vehicle. If you try to change to an occupied seat
* Set up your personal waypoint by right clicking the map screen. You are less likely to make a wrong turn if you know the general direction you wish to go to.

##Ground vehicles
* You need to unlock the 50cert Sunderer Advanced Mobile Station (S AMS) to be able to deploy your vehicle. Remember to equip it after unlocking it.
* When driving close to infantry with no nearby hostiles
* As a gunner
* The default 20mm dual-barreled machinegun on main battle tanks and sunderers does damage even to main battle tanks. Help out your gunner when he is engaging armor. You shooting at the tank too can be the deciding factor.
* Parking a vehicle where people using a jump pad land on kills the people coming in flying. Avoid doing this to friendlies.
* Do not park vehicles on vehicle spawn points. It will only end badly.
* Turn off your lights by pressing L. Using them only attracts attention.

##Air vehicles
* Fly in third person mode (T) for better view on your surroundings.
* Rebind air vehicle exit to something you won't hit accidentally when reloading.
* There is no parachute, then jump out. If you are going too fast or too high, you will die, the exception being if you are in a Galaxy.
* Consider binding the pitch controls to your keyboard. This allows you a faster and finer control over your aircraft.
* Set your personal waypoint to a safe location you can use to resupply and repair. This way

###The World
##Continents
* As of now
* You can change continent by using the terminal with a planet on it at your factions warp gate.
* By capturing all capturable terrain on a continent
* You lose the bonus if another faction succeeds in capturing all capturable territory from said continent.
* The bonuses are -10% on infantry (Indar)

##Bases
* There are three types of major facilities: Bio labs
* Tech Plants allow acquisition of main battle tanks from connected territories. You can always acquire main battle tanks from the warp gate.
* Bio labs give the owning faction a small health regeneration in connected territories.
* Amp stations award large amount of mechanized or air resources and reduce the overheating of base turrets.
* A multitude of smaller outposts with no specific bonuses (except resources) exist between these major facilities.

##Capturing
* If you see that control points have less than their max number of people on it (not all 6 on a CP, it caps faster!
* Capture process's speed is affected by your factions influence on the base. Check the pie chart on the left side of your screen for for your influence. Influence is based on the adjacent hexes owned by your faction.
* The capture process is a ""tug of war"". You need to undo all the enemy's progress before your factions capture bar starts to progress.
* The bar on top of your screen is not the bases capture progress. It's the capture progress for the single point you are on.
* You can not capture bases that have no connection to friendly territory. If you lose the connection after starting the capture process
* Destroying the SCU (Spawn Control Unit) prevents the owners of the base from spawning in that bases spawn rooms.
* Some hostile shields block only vehicles
* Some shields can be shot through by the owner of the facility. Attackers can not shoot back.
* Shields have icons on them
* Everyone can hack generators by pressing E for a few seconds. This causes the generator to destabilize
* Shooting (or using explosives) at a generator only damages that friend of yours who was trying to hack it. You can not damage generators with weapons.
* An exploding generator will kill you. Don't stand within a dozen meters of an one that is about to go boom.
* Bio labs can be accessed through teleporters and jump pads from outlying
* You can **never** enter the bio lab from directly beneath it as an attacker.

##Defending
* Stabilize (unhack) a generator as any class by going to it and pressing E for a few seconds.

##Resources
* You need resources to purchase vehicles (air and ground)
* Resources are granted every 5 minutes based on the regions owned by your faction on the continent you are on.
* You can see the amount of resources you will gain next time on the right side of your map screen.

1361839458.0,1986in,Short explanation of our banning/suspension policies towards cheaters,j_smedley,819,124,424,"I wanted to briefly explain how we approach banning and clear up some misconceptions out there.

First off. If we have clear evidence of a person cheating we ban them. We search for any other accounts they have and we ban those too. We have very good hacking detection algorithms. They aren't perfect though. There are some things that are very hard to detect. There is no ""7 day ban"". That's a myth. Sometimes we suspend someone for 7 days. This is typically someone who is breaking a rule but it doesn't warrant banning. Sometimes we suspend people for something while we actually suspect them of cheating. We'll watch them when they come back and the GM's are able to watch people while they play to make sure we're satisfied they are cheating.

Sometimes people say ""But this guy is an obvious aimbotter"". That may be true. It may not be. There are a lot of really good people in this game. There are also aimbotting scumbags. Telling the difference can be tough for our players sometimes but it's not for us. However we are careful about who we ban. We don't just ban because some player reports and says person X is an aimbotter. We actually put in the time to confirm this.

Also please don't use the new player site as ""proof"" that someone is cheating. I said when we launched it that it's still beta and we're still working out some data issues.

Also please realize the fight against cheaters is not a war we will ever be finished with. We make new detection and anti-hack code

I hope this helps clear this up at least a little. I'm sure there will be people that don't think we're doing enough. After having personally viewed some of the major cheat sites I can tell you I'm blown away by how sophisticated some of these operations are. They are making money on this. We're working on that from another angle too that I'm not going to go into just yet (hint. it involves lawyers) . But we have the resources to fight this fight and we will keep doing it.

We will not tolerate bigots, anti-semites or people being basic asshats in our game. If we catch you doing any of that you're gone. I've read a great deal about The Enclave and seen enough to make me make this general comment - if I see any of this behavior whatsoever in the game I will personally ban anyone doing it. I will do it publicly and I will do it loudly and as broadly as I can possibly make happen. Go play another game if you want to act like a jerk. We don't need or want your business.

In the specific incident that happened TB responded to it very well and we're going to make sure to avoid showcasing any guild that represents itself that way even outside the game. If you don't like that

I want to be clear that there's nothing we will do inside the game if you follow our rules. That wouldn't be right.  We also aren't trying to be the internet police. This is a free country. People get to say what they want to say. But not in our game. It's our way or the highway on these subjects.

I also want all to know this is a hobby horse of mine personally. I really can't stand racists or homophobes or anti-semites. I think they are foul human beings and really don't want them anywhere near me.

Anyways. I hope I haven't minced words.

Thanks

One More Thing - I'm adding this for the benefit of some of the stuff I've read in the thread. In no way am I trying to cast aspersions on the entire guild The Enclave. There are mostly great people in there that I enjoy playing with.

***I propose that a simple message (informing the player that he/she is being revived) is displayed somewhere on the screen of the downed player the EXACT MOMENT a medic begins the revival process.  This will allow downed players to make a more informed decision on whether or not to tap-out.***

One could say that the current implementation is more realistic in that once you are dead you have no further awareness of your surroundings until you are suddenly revived and are processing your senses again.  However

 So this post is about SOE's **policy** regarding hackers

I think it's completely unacceptable that hackers are given a free pass like this in this game.  I understand there is a business aspect to this, red, comic sans letters.  

If I had it my way

The hacker paranoia has taken hold within the community.  I've seen hackers that I am 100% sure about make it all the way to ~BR30.  I have a list of people whom I suspect, since money=station cash=weapons=certs it must be nice to steal your way through the game.

**How do I know this and where's my proof?**

  Well funny enough

Here's the email and here's their stats prior to having the ban lifted:

[E-mail](http://i.imgur.com/uCozY6n.png)

[Stats](http://imgur.com/I1layDq

Here's their stat page after the ban is lifted:

[Post ban stats](http://imgur.com/I1layDq

Yep, and he got some nice passive cert gain!  

This is not a one-time thing.  I have multiple confirmations from different hackers at different BR levels (one at BR40).  I'm keeping some of it to myself for now because I want to see what happens to these people.  I wouldn't be surprised if nothing does.

This sure as hell isn't the hard-line against cheaters Smedley was proclaiming a few months ago.  You may never be able to completely rid online games of cheaters but when your policy is to just give them a free pass - that's completely unacceptable to me and probably a lot of you in the community.  If I ever stop playing this game

It's basically a new section in our normal forums that will be called Roadmap. In this section we will set up topics that relate to the things in our roadmap. The purpose is to have active discussion of the entire roadmap. There is a reddit style scoring system that allows people to upvote and downvote things. That's going to give us some rough idea of how people feel about a particular roadmap idea.

Does this mean we're changing it to ""the mob rules""? absolutely not. It's just a simple tool for us to be able to gauge sentiment about a particular topic. Remember it's still a forum thread (although with cool nested comments) and we'll still be reading what people are actually saying.

However if we list 5 topics for February and people highly vote 4 of those 5 and everyone hates on one of the ideas

In addition we're going to be implementing a new suggestion area with this same functionality that will allow users to create new threads. This likely won't go live tomorrow. This new functionality is in QA right now but it's likely to still have some bugs when you all jump in there. So we want to start with just the Roadmap section.

For the haters out there that say mobs dumb down games - I just flat out disagree with you that it's going to happen here. We have a vision for this game. You're going to see that tomorrow. Will it be one you like? I hope so. Will you agree with the order we're doing things? maybe.. maybe not. Probably not in some cases. Will be move things to more closely mirror the order you want things done? Sometimes yes.. sometimes it's not possible because of development time.

This is just another way for you to have your say in the future of Planetside 2. We want this to be a game we all share the vision for.

The problem is that camo is meant to help you blend into the enviroment so that you have an advantage at a distance: **NOT** act as a means to confuse the enemy in CQC -- which the VS camo is currently doing. 

SoE needs to rethink how the camo is applied to soldiers because it's causing some problems when it comes to identifying who is who.

That's what modern tank warfare is like. Are we getting anything like that? 

Frankly nerfs *suck*. No one wants their favorite toy nerfed into oblivion. And, even if they nerfed the AV turret or whatever people are complaining about this week, tanks still have a poorly defined battlefield role and just aren't that awesome. Instead of randomly nerfing the shit out of AV turrets let's make tanks *really cool*. 

Some suggestions

- Active point defenses.


Something like the real world Trophy-keeper systems. A module that shoots down incoming missiles in a volume around the tank. Balance it any way you want - Limited ammo

Say you have an anti-missile module for the Sunderer. It goes in the AMS slot. When it's active it has up to 6 charges. Each ""charge"" will shoot down one missile in a radius of 10m around the Sundy. Once a charge is expended it will take 15s to regenerate. If all the charges are used up it takes 90s to regenerate a full ""magazine"". The module works by creating an invisible sphere object that collides with missiles, holding more charges, or faster charge regen. It'd give tanks some protection, but requires a dedicated support vehicle and can still be overwhelmed by mass fire. Close range shots from inside the sphere are *not* blocked. 

WHY? This would give sunderers a new role supporting armor advances. Creating an area of protection would give groups of tanks an opportunity to advance into a range where they can effectively engage AV turrets. It would also let a sundy protect tanks from distant enemies sniping with guided launchers

* Infantry style shields for all MBTs 

Each MBT gets a regenerating shield the same way infantry get a regenerating shield. It can soak damage from the front and sides

WHY? Simple

* Proper optics

Tanks really should have targeting range-finders, but that would be nice. And realistic. Because they had that feature in WWII.

WHY? better optics would give tanks a better chance to actually hit infantry and AV turrets sniping at them from long range.  

* Coaxial machine guns with matched trajectories and tracers

Okay, to ""non-skill"" or something. A coax machine gun would help out in a lot of ways. real world tanks often have a coax gun that has the same trajectory as the main gun - A tracer fired from the coax gun will hit the same target as the main gun. You can fire the coax gun to gauge where your main gun will hit and save yourself from firing a shot that will miss. It allows for much more consistent first-round shots, especially against distant targets. 

A coax machine gun also gives tanks an alternate means of dealing with infantry. Welding a kobalt to the side of the main gun would let tanks shoot at infantry trying to bum-rush them with C4. It'd give them a weapon that doesn't *absolutely need to direct-hit* when firing up on infantry on ridges. Currently hitting infantry above you is extremely difficult. There is a reason real-world tanks have coax MGs. They'd also serve as a deterrent to aircraft. The kobalt doesn't do much damage

WHY? MGs allow you a better chance of killing an attacking LA or medic if your cannon shot misses. ""Matched trajectories"" allows you to fire some test shots at infantry on a cliff or air pad. If your shots hit the cliff in the right spot you know you can fire a cannon shot and it will explode on the cliff instead of flying over or hitting low. Being able to test where your shot will hit means you can pop out, then pop back into cover instead of having to wait around and fire multiple cannon shots until you get the range right. 

* Change how damage is calculated 

Add a system that checks the *angle at which a round impacted the tank*. Incoming rounds that hit the tank at a high angle should do little or no damage as they skip off the vehicles armor. Rounds that hit the tank at a good angle close to 90 degrees punch through and do their full damage. Tanks that are hull-down or in cover become much more survivable. Coincidentally you could also add a top-attack option to guided missiles - Have them pop straight up and arc down on top of enemy armor to get a 90 degree hit on the thinner top armor. This probably isn't feasible *at all*. But if implimented it would reduce instances of Sunderers outshooting Main Battle Tanks with their Basilisks and ATVs being able to destroy tanks. 

WHY? I just think this idea is awesome. You've got me dead to rights - I like tank sims. 

* Add an ERA module

Explosive Reactive Armor is a layer of explosive material applied to the exterior of a tank. When an AT round hits the ERA the ERA explodes. The force of that explosion moving out from the tank disrupts the force of the AT round

WHY? In game terms this just gives you a few free hits before you start taking real damage. It's effectively a shield with limited charges that can soak up the first shot from an AV turret

* add a ""Heat Camo"" module

Add a module that allows all tanks to ""Deploy"" thermal dump panels when not moving. The dump panels just vent engine heat out of the vehicle in weird directions to create a fuzzier heat signature for incoming missiles. All this does from a mechanics standpoint is create a tank 'targeting box' that is bigger than the actual hit-box, but reduces the effectiveness of lock-ons at long range. 

WHY? In game terms this would be a random chance for lock-ons to miss a stationary tank to make lock-on sniping from long distance less effective. Again - A counter to the massed infantry on an air tower spamming lock-ons


* Tank active camo

Allow tanks to cert into the same kind of camo that Infiltrators and Wraiths use. The camo can only be activated when the tank is stationary. Once activated the tank can still move

WHY? Invisible tanks are hard to snipe with AV turrets. Tanks can now wait in ambush, an infantry rush could be very disruptive and help outnumbered players turn the tide. Invisible tanks are harder to Lolpod

* Add IR smoke as a standard feature of all tanks

IRL *all* tanks have a smoke screen system. It's one of the most basic tank defenses. Add IR smoke, but give everyone, especially newbies, a chance of breaking lock-on locks. 

WHY? Nubs need something to protect them from lock-on spam. And if all tanks always had IR smoke as an option they'd be that much more resistant to mass lock-ons

* add proper smoke grenade launchers

With real tanks smoke grenades tend to be fired *forward* of the tank and are used to cover an advance as much as disrupt targeting. Give tanks a bank of smoke-grenade launchers that can be fired in front of the vehicle to hide it as it moves into an assault position. 

WHY? This would give tanks a new role providing concealment for infantry advances. It would make AV turret sniping much harder. it would give tanks a chance of hiding from LOLpods. 

* Add a coax gun to all tank secondaries

Most tanks also have a pintle-mounted LMG in addition to any other secondary weaponry. Giving the tank gunner an LMG would make it much easier for them to defend the tank against infantry attack. While specialized weapons are nice they tend to be a little *too* specialized.  Infantry are far and away the greatest threat to tanks

WHY? This would give the secondary gunner a better chance of stopping tank-mine and C4 rushes or killing infantry circling behind the tank. It would give the tank much better anti-infantry capability

* Vastly increase HP

In exchange for increased HP and armor tanks become vulnerable to mobility kills. When the tank is reduced to 50% health it becomes much slower and less maneuverable. At 33% health the tank becomes immobile. At 25% health the gun's reload speed drops by 20$. At 15% health the tank is completely immobile. 

The trade off is -1.75-3x hp. The tank can take much, much more vulnerable, gradually losing the ability to dodge incoming fire and retaliate unless it is repaired. 

WHY? This would make tanks much more complex and interesting. They'd be much tankier and harder to kill. At the same time the amount of damage that currently kills a tank would now make it very vulnerable. 

* Add crewed guns with stabilized turrets

Seriously - Being able to fire the main gun on the move would be a vast improvement. Having one guy doing *nothing but driving*

Personally I think tanks should *never* have been one person vehicles. Requiring at least two people changes the cost/benefit scale such that you can make tanks much tougher. After all - each one *requires* two people who might otherwise be infantry. 

WHY? It's hard to drive in one direction and shoot in another. It's also hard to watch your own back. Splitting the jobs up between two people means the gunner can just worry about shooting things and the driver can just worry about moving and dodging fire. 

I'm out of ideas. My point, instead of trying to come up with ways to make the AV turret completely useless.

Its like getting kicked in the face when all your support roles that are essential to any force is punished by not being given XP when without you the force would fall apart and die slowly.

1355176975.0,14mlnx,"The current system of cert gain, which is focused almost entirely on kills, is reinforcing the wrong behaviors in this game. By changing the way we gain certs, I feel the game will be a lot more fun and feel a lot less grindy, even if the rate is not changed.",497,"Cert gain as it is currently does not encourage the right behaviors in players. Right now, and only hardcore players will remain.

The primary issue is that the focus of certs is entirely on killing. If a player comes across a well placed AMS sundie by the base he is trying to defend, people who choose to play support roles such as piloting galaxies and liberators feel like they are being punished because they earn so few certs.

I feel like the difference in cert gain between a player who is farming certs in the most effective way and someone who is playing just for fun should be small enough that it won't matter to most people. The best way to do this is to remove the effectiveness of gaining certs from kill farming

Example: Say SOE feels that they want the average player to gain 50 certs per hour. The default passive cert gain when playing should be 25 certs per hour, your cert gain will only be half of what is average, instead of 1/4 or worse. Now, to prevent people focusing on kills, it now takes 500 xp per cert (5 kills) instead of 250. Base capping is adjusted so that it still rewards 1,2, or 4 certs depending on size. In fact, so cert gain is the same for everything

Now that kills are less of a focus

-Sunderer bounty: For every player that spawns at an AMS sundie, 50 spawns = 1000 xp bounty, or 2 certs). The player who kills an important sunderer has just done something very important for the team, and would then be rewarded for it. Also, the bounty would be shared for players that assist to avoid kill stealing (do 50% of the damage in killing it, get 50% of the bounty). This bounty could also apply to other vehicles that have done a lot of damage to your team within your current hex. Kill that liberator that just killed 20 of your teammates, and get a nice 500 xp bonus.

-Air denial: People complain about getting no rewards when playing as anti-air, but they shouldn't have an easy time killing them; that should be the job of other aircraft. So, to still reward anti-air rolls, they get an area denial bonus. This requires one person to do 50% or greater damage to an ESF, 35% or greater to a liberator, or 25% or greater to a galaxy (for libs and galaxies, the total damage done by teammates still must be a least 50%). If the aircraft is not killed, then a 100 xp air denial bonus is given.

-Base capping rewards: Right now, just to get the cap bonus. There is no point to being there, but everyone just still hangs around for the 5 minutes it takes to cap that amp station. Bases should give participation rewards on cap that don't require you to be at the base to receive. Like in Guild Wars 2, you get a gold, silver, or bronze depending on your participation on taking the base. Example for taking AMP station: Bronze- Less than 25% of cap time spent at base and less than 300 points in hex during cap. Silver- Less than 50% of cap time at base and less than 1000xp gained in hex. Gold- At least 50% time of cap in base hex, or more than 1000xp gained in hex during cap.

These are just some ideas towards making cert gain less of a player's focus and allowing them to play for fun while still being rewarded. Ideally, even if I had fun doing what I'm doing.",,False,self,t5_2s48x,False,tr,

Multi-crewing vehicles is one of the most fun aspects of playing a game like this and it should be encouraged. But certain roles in certain vehicles are extremely unrewarding from a score/xp perspective.

I feel guilty asking people to tail gun my lib. It was a valuable role, but at least he'd get something to make it worthwhile. But a three man lib is more capable and more fun than a two man, so someone has to volunteer to take the crappy job.

With tanks, but not the other way around. Gunning a tank is more worthwhile than tailgunning a lib, but nowhere near as much as pulling your own tank.

Recently, and barely get rewarded. But he's a valuable member of the crew, he can bring repairs, or increase the vehicle firepower with a max.

All members of a vehicle crew should receive XP benefits from the accomplishments of the vehicle. This can disclude passengers in a sunderer or galaxy since they aren't really crew. I would suggest they all get equal XP - they're all putting equal time into the vehicle and all serving a purpose. But if you aren't willing to go that far

Multi-crewed vehicles are the best part of this game

1. You shouldn't get any grief for killing people when you spawn a vehicle and it decides to run over a bunch of noobs hanging out on the vehicle pad because you aren't in control.

2. Vehicle horns would be a nice feature and would help alert infantry on the ground and encourage them to move out of your way.

3. Headlights don't help much in Planetside 2, but how about a option in the settings for if you want them off by default, you could add in a option for default vehicle permissions as well.

4. Shield Generator/SCU exploding shouldn't cause grief.

K:D was, along with BEP, CEP, and SEP (Battle Experience Points, Command Experience Points, Support Experience Points).  However, people didn't really pay that much attention to it

The whole reason K/D is such a huge deal to a lot of people right now is that, a combination of the metagame itself and the amount of XP (BEP/CEP/SEP) you gained per play session from said metagame kept the K/D from being that huge of a deal. Dying several times in the process of advancing the metagame often netted you more experience points than getting 10 or 15 kills, and the territory you flipped in the process would remain yours for a substantial amount of time.

My suggestion would be to bring back three aspects of PS1's XP system. First

Second, killing some of the most dangerous players could net you as much BEP as capturing a minor base.

Third, for example, for 1-2 minutes after that support action took place, you'd receive something like 1% of the XP they gained by killing or supporting others. This would not, of course, be subtracted from their XP as you wouldn't want to penalize them in any way, but would simply be delivered to you.

There should not be a flat rate of XP gained for ANYTHING

Ever heard of a equivalent in real life military tactics? Nope. And there is a reason why. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encirclement

The attacking force gets cut off from its supply and reinforcements, or obliterate the enemy with what it has. If it dosen't do that, then this happens

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad#The_Subjugation_of_the_Sixth_Army 

But this doesn't work in planetside 2

I propose three things to change this.

1. No working spawn tubes or terminals territories that have been disconnected from the warpgate. (Another, or enemy territories not on the front line.)

2. Sunderers can only deploy AMS in territory connected to the warp gate or enemy territory that have friendly influence (i.e. on the frontline)

3. Vehicles cannot resupply in sectors that have been cut off. Engineers and ammo sundies will only have a limited amount of ammo (say two packs of ammo) and cannot deploy more than that until they have returned to connected territory.



These three changes should have the following effects:

Zerging into enemy territory is now a big risk. If you get cut off you will start to bleed dry of men and supplies.

Zergs will need to leave men behind to protect their supply route

Defending against a zerg now can be done waving them by

Eventually people will realize it is no longer a viable tactic to rush headlong into enemy territory and will try to push a front line instead of a point.

However, allow galaxies to carry giant ammo crates, so that they can carry supplies to pockets of troops that have been cut off, likewise, you could award points for each player delivered to cut off, occupied, territories.

Basically resupplying by airlift

Anyway

If you like them upvote and maybe the SOE guys that frequent this reddit will see them.



Edit: Great discussion going on here

u/Thingamyjib Suggested that it was a bit harsh to just kill the spawn tubes instantly, or a timer. Perhaps make it possible to reset the timer or number of respawns by a supply drop.  

Another edit: Many people saying, it's human nature, people who don't want to think will just roll with the flow. And that's cool there should be room for players who want to do that if they want, they shouldn't have to log in and play chess. But the mindlessness of the tactic should not be so game changing and should be counter-able by playing smart.

**[1/8] - Rest in comments.**

Planetside 2 continues to be a fundamentally good game


**BATTLE FLOW - WHERE IS IT?**


The big problems which must be addressed are the how battles flow across a continent, the big problem right now lies in the aftermath of the actual fighting when the attacker begins camping the defender inside the spawn rooms. This creates a situation with guys outside the shield and the guys inside the shield, both waiting to just snag some cheesy kills. The giant problem with this is that there can be just one guy inside that invulnerable spawn room and the attackers still must camp it; after all, that one defender can repair the SCU and the generator as soon as the attackers leave to actually do something productive. It’s not that the attackers want to camp him, it’s that they have to camp him.


My suggestion here is to implement a “pain field” once the SCU gets destroyed. Specifically, it contributes to the overall flow of battle when combined with my next suggestion. To set the scenario up, the SCU gets destroyed, the pain fields turn on and kicks the defenders out, but then what happens?

In the current game, they destroy the flow because there are too many options to have a centralized fall back point where a new defense can be mounted.

Whenever a large defending force is destroyed, are thrown all over the place and unable to mount an effective defense, or an effective attempt at a re-secure, from another territory.

I would like to clarify what I mean by momentum actually. Momentum, as the defenders continue to lose in increasing magnitude, they end up abandoning the idea of defending altogether. To put it simply, it’s a failure spiral for them because there are less defenders available in the relevant territories each time due to the dispersion effect I just described. Eventually, the attackers not only don’t get the big fights they want, but it gets as bad as being relegated to ghost hacking an empty territory.

My suggestion for this is to change the deployment options to only adjacent territories which you are physically connected to via the map plus the warp gate. The reason for this is simple: it will create a more focused fall back point for the defense and a clear avenue of attack which even a new or casual player will be able to easily identify. As an example, or the warp gate. This will help to create a real front, but we’re not done just yet.

In order to help facilitate both the death of the boring spawn room camp, small outposts do not have SCU’s; once again, you are forced to camp the enemy inside the spawn rooms, promoting that cheesy gameplay which isn’t fun for anyone.

My suggestion would function the same way as it does in a big base: pain fields would activate and kick defenders out upon the SCU’s destruction. Keep in mind, and the current overload system for SCU’s and generators works great in the current game.

With SCU’s added to every facility in the game and utilizing the current, especially with regards to facilities.

Secondary objectives are extremely important for fun. We joke around about the “spawn camp metagame” as the only current objective for an attacker is to push defenders into the spawn room and camp them there. While the defenders are waiting for cheap kills

Let me give another example to highlight how I envision this unfolding. Let’s say the TR are attacking the VS at Feldspar Canyon. The TR push

What this does is promote a direction

This is still not enough, having random factors, such as the influence system in its current implementation, suddenly and for reasons a player fighting inside a territory cannot fathom, suddenly swing the capture timer in one direction or another is bad for the game. The biggest culprit in a base capturing too quickly is the influence system.

1372074219.0,1gyouy,The other side or why your faction doesn't suck as much as you think - Spreading positivity to the subreddit,bouncyboing,464,89,278,"I was forever picking fault with the NC and screaming over powered at the other factions. So I decided

To begin with I made the mistake of rolling my alt characters on servers that were already over populated by the factions I choose. So the factions I joined just zerged instead of using tactics. (Sorry you guys on these factions on these servers but zerging is easy - sheer numbers will hammerblow any tactical superiority.) I have a TR on Miller and a VS on Woodman. Both low level so I will re-roll them in the opposite direction. VS on Miller and TR on Woodman. I rolled heavies on both sides and tried out both tanks as this is my comfort zone when I play NC.

BR 52 NC as main. Before I tried the other sides, it feels like a powerhouse and very tanky. Only started playing it after they nerfed the HE so never got to be a HE farmer. Went AP and Enforcer and specifically play as anti armour and love to charge in with overpowered shield up decimating the enemy tanks. Magriders can be tough to hit at range with their strafing, prowlers are xp pinatas waiting to burst.

So I tried TR first. Joined a zergy TR and zergy is never fun. Outnumbering your enemy means no tactics and sheer numbers to win. The LMG feels nice to shoot

The Prowler feels wrong. It's not tanky enough to sit still and shell the enemy. It feels like I have already maxed out Rival Combat Chassi on it, compact size and turning circle definitely makes it feels like it wants to play a different role than sitting still. Oh and its armour felt atrocious after being inside a Vanguard for so long. I usually hear the plink, plink of a tank buster when they fly overhead, but the Prowler went boom before I heard the first plink. And the Vulcan just felt plain bad at range when in lockdown. The Vulcan wants to be a shock weapon too! The whole concept of the Prowler is wrong and I feel bad for you guys. It wants to be a shock tank but it is told to be a long range artillery bombardment war machine.

The VS. It's weird having weapons that shoot where you tell them too. Recoil is manageable and the bullets land where the crosshair is. That being said it had crap damage. Again. Losing rof AND damage in exchange for no bullet damage means close range is a dicey experience. No damage to burst down in close range and no rof to make up for the lack of damage. Definitely felt like a medium to long range gun. The LMG felt nice to use at range but ammo ran out so damn fast. Small magazine size but phenomenally fast reload time was a double edged sword in encounters below medium range. The dumbfire rocket launcher felt different somehow but I couldn't place my finger on it. Just different. Despite being fun to shoot with

The Magrider I could not get to grips with. The steering and the strafing is a something that requires lots of practice to be good with. The vanguard and prowler were just sit in and go. Bang you got it. The Magrider requires a whole different skill set to drive and I now hold the talented Magrider strafers in high esteem. It was not easy to get it right first time like the others. The cannon was nothing short of a lesson in a frustration. To get the most from it you really had to understand the movement of the tank which is a skillset I do not possess. What I did love however was the Magriders ability to scale some amazingly steep inclines. You can get to advantageous elevated positions thanks to how it handles steep hills and perhaps that is why the cannon is fixed in place due to this positional advantage it can gain. The Saron was an amazing weapon to use and perfect for long ranging sniping armour. Combine this with the Magriders ability to reach places other tanks can't go and you have a fantastic armour sniping machine.

After these adventures I went home to NC and by god it felt good to have the Gauss SAW in my hands again. Sure the bullets go all over the place when I shoot it, hard hitting gun.

The Vanguard has no identity crisis whatsoever. It knows what it wants to be and it excels all too well in this role. The Magrider is an awesome sniper tank. Knows what it wants to be and when played well, fast and agile! Let it be what it wants to be and make it a shock tank. My Prowler is definitely going to be certed in this direction. Radar will replace lockdown and it will let me see my enemies and make those raiding attacks with a Vulcan gunner all the easier to execute. Stealth is another option I am looking into. I know the Prowler wants to be this and I am gonna let it be what it wants to be.

NC have it good. We have awesome weapons that require investment to get good use from them but reward you greatly when you have invested enough in them. We have great tanks and knowing my enemies strengths and weaknesses has only made me a stronger player.

Play the other sides. Learn your enemies weaknesses. Exploit them!

I noticed this multiple times last night and this morning while playing. Operatives completely ruining what was a well coordinated assault on a base

When there's a battle going on and our empire is storming a front and pushing forward, who just stands there on top of our spawn room with no fucks given about what he's doing to the balance of the fight.

What's worse is when they intentionally drop into a large group of enemies in a hot zone causing massive amounts of friendly fire and teamkilling as people try harder and harder to kill this enemy who has dropped right into our laps.

There is no reason why you can't make these operatives invisible. If that's not an option then they need to be displayed as friendly to EVERYONE or they need to be killable.

This is the first time I've actually wanted to rage quit this game. When we lose our footing on a ridge because SOE employees see fit to destroy the balance of a very even fight using GM powers I don't even want to fucking bother.

I've heaved heavy praise of SOE since early beta for the way they've run this game and I'm very happy that they're taking cheaters seriously. But really, I've seen it used for the Friday Ops.

So

The numbers: http://hastebin.com/xawewarexu.txt

What I have found is that with Average Territory

However

So, including TI-Alloys and Allatum Biolab.  They also take the immediate bases around the biolab to secure their hold on it.  The TR now have 16 infantry resource income every 5 minutes.  As a player on the TR, you can now pull a Max 2 times from full resources (you can purchase 1 grenade).   Once you do that, with 16 resources per tick, now must wait **95 minutes** to pull another MAX suit.  

The numbers don't get better.  If a faction is push down to only the area surrounding the warpgate

The most important one, too, dies, you must now wait anywhere from **1.5 hours to 3 hours** (depending on the continent/WG) to pull another Sunderer.  At that point, just log off.

- Firstly, but not all the time. If you give the monkey rewards too often it will take the reward for granted, knowing that it can get the reward any time it wants. Then it loses interest. If you don't give the monkey enough reward it will get frustrated, and find something else to do. 

- To keep the monkey interested you need to find a sweet spot. The monkey needs to know that it *will* get a reward

- The monkey needs to make an effort. Too little effort and the reward becomes common and loses it's value. Too much effort and the reward isn't worth the effort it takes to earn. 

- Right now the Monkey feels that it is not being rewarded. After completing a difficult, feels he's not getting a worthwhile reward. 

- It doesn't matter if the player is paying or not. The game relies on free players to keep the server population high and allow the game systems to work properly. For paid players to enjoy themselves there needs to be a minimum population that can keep battles going. For non-paying players to want to invest money in the game they have to be enjoying gameplay *before* they put any money in. To keep both populations player you need to have a progression system that provides a positive reinforcement; When you play the game you are rewarded for playing the game in a manner that is satisfying to the player.

[The Skinner Box: This is the prototype for all video games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber)

TEST, well organized NC force had pushed us back to the warpgate. It was hours and hours of constant, unrelenting fighting as we struggled to resist overwhelming numbers. We executed flawless combined pod drops to ambush and destroy NC Sunderers. We pulled armor columns to blunt the enemy rush. We sent spec ops teams wide around to cut off enemy reinforcements. We did pretty well anything. It was exhilerating and watching dozens of players smashing away at each other fits the definition of Epic.

Then I looked at my cert points. 

During that whole many hours long battle I accrued 18 cert points. 

That took the wind out of my sails. All of that fighting and I didn't pull enough certs for even a low level upgrade. I was rather expecting to see 50 or 60. Enough to grab a mid level upgrade or an attachment. I certainly wasn't slacking. I took out several sunderers, and generally fought the fight. Put my total points came in quite low.

Some thoughts

- Put defense XP back in. It's nice to get some little acknowledgement when you take back the facility. Sometimes that amounts to five or six minutes sitting on the point *not* fighting. The battle is outside the walls

- Bring back control point flip XP. Again

- Bring back ticket point control for some installations. In certain bases Tug of War ends up taking forever

- Reduce the XP per cert. I broadly agree that the prices are alright. Prior to tonight I'd thought that the XP gains where in about the right place - You spend a few hours playing

After tonight I no longer believe that. Hours of constant fighting should be a good baseline for what kind of experience gains you can expect under the best circumstances. In this case they were extremely disappointing. When you're badly outnumbered (tonight we figured it was somewhere between 2 and 4 to 1 against us) you have to put in a great deal of effort to achieve modest goals. That translates to very little XP being gained. You end up spending a lot of time shooting at sunderers, and, most of all, dying constantly. You just can't beat 2 or 3 to one odds in a gunfight. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is

The battle felt heroic. This is as intense of a battle as you'll ever see in PS2. 

And the rewards felt pathetic. At this rate 18-20 hours of play might net me 100 certs. I tend to play low-return roles like squad lead, and so forth. Even relatively high return roles - HA, LA, tank, AA, aren't able to get consistent kills when you're outnumbered that heavily. Likewise, I imagine the other team is getting little XP as the compete with four other people to get kill XP. 

It feels as though prior versions of the XP system saw you gaining a great deal of XP from capping and other activities. Now a large share of XP comes from getting kills. That's inconsistent at best. In pitched battles you do a huge amount of damage to the enemy and get almost nothing back for it simply because you're not landing killing shots. It's frustrating.

Finally: I would suggest that XP be shared throughout the squad and platoon. As it stands there are too many important roles that are not rewarded. One way to reduce the impact of that would be to share a percentage of XP with the entire squad or platoon. Squad leaders, on comms, or babysitting sunderers. Some form of shared squad XP would reward players who take unpopular roles for the contribution they are making to the squad as a whole. 

TLDR; The current XP gain requires far too much effort for far too little reward. The slow XP gains and inconsistent XP gain from completing important objectives is frustrating to a degree that detracts from the enjoyment of the game.

* Taking the role of squad leader for 20 hours + getting 500 spawns at your beacons (beret/bad ass bionic eye)

What do you guys think? Opinions and or more ideas for roles/things to unlock welcome!

UPDATE

* It is very likely that the SOE development team has a very limited ability to spend time on developing things for the game that does not have a monetary benefit. I see it as totally viable that if worst comes to worst
* Patches existed in Planetside 1 rewarding players for specific things, identifiable and interesting. I really like the idea of being able to identify an experienced player in a certain trait as you fight next to them in the field. Seeing your squad leader with a beret means you know those spawn beacons will be spot on, or running next to a medic with a tricked out medic backpack makes you sure he has your back if you get shot.
* This though process would also be applicable to titles, titles should be earned dynamically and be class/vehicles/weapon based (like Officer Cadet, Pilot Officer, Flight lieutenant, Wing Commander for players that spend hours and do well in aircraft, Ordinance Expert for C4 and mine kills for any class or Field Surgeon for dedicated medics.",,self,nc,

##Story Time

So my the last of my outfit quit 4-5 releases ago... I've been playing solo ever since. I certed up my Scythe and Lightning and that's how I'd been playing most of the time.

Since the resource cost increase I found myself playing less and less. Just logged in to try GU12

The game just isn't fun anymore. I don't have ""squad mates"" to play with... pubby squads are full of kids that talk too much and (at 35) I can't really stand the annoying chatter.

*I want* to play

So I might log in and try some infantry play... but if I wanted to do that

I've been an Auraxium subscriber for some time now

Reddit-copy follows:

_____________________

## Extremely short version 
## (for the TL/DR crowd)

1. Unoccupied MANA turrets can be used by anyone on the same team.
2. If the MANA turret is occupied
3. The engineer who placed the turret gets +10xp for every kill someone else makes using it.

## The longer version

Consider this ranking of player-importance:

1. The engineer who owns the turret
2. The engineer's Squadmate
3. The engineer's Platoonmate (from one of the other three squads)
4. Any other person on the same team

If you are higher on that list than whoever is currently using the turret, and you seamlessly take their place. (If the engineer redeploys the turret, the current user is also kicked off.)

## Why is this awesome

Turrets become something you can set up in good spots, and your teammates can still use it while you are busy doing your engineer-specific work. If you come back, you can easily resume using it. 

*Unlike* vehicles, there's no finite ammo to waste... So just let them use it, unless you want it back.

&amp;nbsp;

**How mines are used 80% of the time:**

- drop them under a stationary vehicle and manually detonate them

*That should be the job of C4 and mines frankly have just took their place for all vehicles that don't have mineguard

&amp;nbsp;

**How mines should be used:**

- a tank column is going to transit through a busy road once an adjacent base caps and 3 engies with a high level of utility pouches would decimate the zerglings that aren't paying attention

- a base has just been capped and it's an important one to hold; to add an additional layer of defense around it

&amp;nbsp;

**What could be done to solve this issue? Four things:**

1. **New Mechanic:** Shooting a mine will not blow it up. The mine will fizz a bit and then it will **despawn when shot.**

2. **Cert change:** The second level of engineer mines should award an additional **2 mines** instead of one. Now

3. **UI change:** Friendlies should be able to see if a mine is friendly (with the little indicator) from **at least 50m**. The current distance now is about 5 meters the last time I tested. Too many friendlies are shooting down our mines because they don't want to risk.

4. **Mine Scale change:** Mines have been ""nerfed"" a few updates ago by making their size larger. Before they were too hard to notice

To better the management and coordination of multiple platoons in game we should be able to form companies

A company should consist of  2 platoons. A battalion should hold two companies. Company leaders and above should have at least the same management and coordination abilities as platoon leaders just for more people.  For example Company 1 commander can set a company waypoint for Company 1 and be able to move anyone in his Company between squads an kick anyone from his company. He has no power over company 2. The battalion leader can manage both companies. I think higher level leaders should get more leadership abilities

Platoon, as it has 48 squad members + the leader. A full Battalion would have 199 people(1 Battalion Commander + 2 Company Commander + 4 Platoon Leaders + 192 squad members).

**ADDRESSING VARIOUS COMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS**:

What if I have multiple characters on the same server and want the XP? - The best solution I can see is to have a button on the character selection screen that harvests your daily certs.  That way you won't need to log into each character on the same server.  **ADDITIONALLY** you'll note that one of the suggestions above was for a two hour lock to begin once the alert began.  So you see the ""Alert Incoming"" message and bail

If you have two characters that you enjoy on the same server - again

1358542277.0,16u5t8,[Idea] Allow bases to be upgraded at the cost of resources like in Guild Wars 2. This would fix the metagame issue.  Examples inside,DJSlambert,332,56,80,"WvWvW (A 3-way faction battle, etc.

This would give players much more immersion

Upgrades are on a per-base basis.  They only affect the base you bought the upgrades for.

Examples:  
-500 mechanical resources would give turrets an extra 100m range  (maximum of +500m)  
-1000 infantry resources would reduce spawn times  
-2000 infantry resources would give Max's spawned there a +100m range on their AA bursters (maximum of +500)  
-A sustained 5000 aircraft resources per hour would give the base an anti-air bubble  

You could have it so individual players had to pay the full price

Given a large enough variety of upgrades

This would also bring about different strategies.  If there was an upgrade that made bases take longer to cap

**PREFACE**

-----

[This has been crossposted to the PS2 official forums

Let me introduce myself.  I play on Jaeger, positions and angles.

Infiltrator cloaking has been an issue since beta

I'm sure anyone who frequents the forums or this Subreddit has seen screenshots and videos circulating

Before I begin

This is an infiltrator who is up-close and in the fight.  He uses an automatic rifle, hacks their terminals and turrets, all while killing enemies through the utilization of the following.

* Footsteps - Listening for footsteps to make a best guess about the enemy position in the structure

* Noise Discipline - Doing as little jumping and sprinting as possible

* Trigger Discipline - Allowing himself to pass up groups of enemies in favor or picking off lone soldiers or pairs

* Knowledge of the base layout - Knowing where jump pads

This is how I play my Infiltrator

-----

**My Gallery**

-----

I considered posting a large album of screenshots for your viewing pleasure

I am using the lowest settings on all available features, I too have done this in order to show you how it's being done.

**I've spent roughly 3 hours now preparing these screenshots and streamlining my explanation to them

Let's get started.

Our first shots are going to be our friendly old infiltrator standing in the middle of the room, in order to more accurately represent how far you would be from an Infiltrator that is actively avoiding you.

* http://i.imgur.com/dtivRvp.jpg - The legs are pretty obvious as they are in a bright section of the room, could easily avoid that.

* http://i.imgur.com/KgTvcH9.jpg

* http://i.imgur.com/JdFt9yz.jpg

Excellent.  If you're looking hard for him he's going to be relatively easy to spot, I don't believe you're very likely to spot him.

Our next set is our cloaked friend taking cover in a corner.

* http://i.imgur.com/u6OXBtr.jpg - I can't even see him.

* http://i.imgur.com/2WLhzhV.jpg - His rifle makes a somewhat weird pattern if you look for it.

* http://i.imgur.com/P7VFdK1.jpg - At this range

* http://i.imgur.com/DxFWr4U.jpg - Hello old chap!

So at this point you may be thinking to yourself ""Wow

The short answer is that they took their shots in lighting conditions that heavily favor being able to see the Infiltrator.  I took my shots in lighting conditions that heavily favor *not* being able to see the Infiltrator.

Positioning clearly plays a huge role in your success as an Infiltrator!  See, while others have chosen bright, glaring solid surfaces in which the dark silhouette of the Infiltrator will contrast.

* http://i.imgur.com/ysv0xce.jpg - A little bit like this! (UI on)

* http://i.imgur.com/zpPAnZq.jpg - Or this! (UI off for comparison)

* http://i.imgur.com/N5DKaGY.jpg - Or even something like this.

* http://i.imgur.com/RpPzzSL.jpg - Hello world!

* http://i.imgur.com/1k5fM44.jpg - Even something as simple as finding a small patch of dirt that won't contrast you can make a **huge** difference!

* http://i.imgur.com/8ZcUiro.jpg - Finding a *large* patch of dirt, my cloaked buddy, fight on.

Now contrast can work both ways.  Knowing the shade you're aiming for is important

* http://i.imgur.com/NvKT8lN.jpg - What's that thing on the wall?

* http://i.imgur.com/usMYsxS.jpg - I see you!

Even in worst-case silhouette positions

* http://i.imgur.com/YB4xhWC.jpg - Something as simple as clouds and some WG sparky effects can turn your obvious shadows into what looks like dark shades in the sky.

-----

**IN CONCLUSION**

-----

Quite frankly, bloom effects and shaders.

I believe cloak should be the same across all settings, I highly doubt one could get enough Infiltrators on their screen to actually cause performance issues.

When it's all said and done

Thanks for reading.  I ask again that before you comment

Also, **please** leave me a comment explaining why.  I've put a lot of effort into this collection and would like to see any constructive criticism or explain things that you might have concerns with!  I will gladly be reading and replying to every comment that is made.  I'd also like to ask that negative criticism not be met with storms of downvotes, I'd really like the chance to discuss all opinions without anybody being slammed into the dust.

A young man in the prime of his youth, security, and room for intellectual growth (such lavish amenities that, for the vast majority of humans who have ever lived, would've been beyond imagination). He, a representative of a species that has conquered nearly every corner of this planet; a species so magnificent that it has braved the depths of the sea, split the atom, and launched itself into the heavens, to put an end to those blights which plague humanity

Instead he spends his time cheating at video games.

“But why?” you ask. “Why isn't he out researching a cure for cancer, just playing the game the same way someone who wasn't a spastic douchebag would?""

Well, twisted psyche to answer. In order to comprehend why he does as he does, we must witness first-hand the grand tragedy of the modern age as it plays out in the microcosm of a fractured soul.

Again

Lounging deeply into his worn, spittle-spraying laugh. He has just obtained yet another head shot through the aid of machine assistance. His eyes gleam with malevolent delight as he takes another long swig of his Mountain Dew. He lets the neon green liquid trickle down the sparse, coarse hair of his neck, settling in its intricate folds as he surveys the kill notification. He guffaws. It is that same BR3 that he has just killed thirteen times in a row. The emotion he is feeling now is something akin to how you or I might experience our wedding vows, or the birth of our first child, or perhaps an orgasm, though these exact feelings are things he's incapable of comprehending as they involve positive emotions towards other human beings. 

""But how?"" you ask. ""How does a heart grow so dark as this?""

It is a long and tragic tale, coalescing into a blackened spirit. Some people, when faced with such horrific adversity, challenge themselves to become better; to be able to stand tall and look down upon their tormentors from a position of moral superiority. Those who are weaker become tormentors themselves; striving to re-establish a sense of control in their life by using what few advantages they do have (physical strength, wealth, specialized skills, etc) in order to take out their frustrations on those who are even less capable of retaliation than themselves. They might pour hours and hours into developing just one inconsequential ability (say, final category. These individuals are so pitiful that despite their burning desire to take out their frustrations on the people around them
 
So how does the PS2 hacker attempt to impose his will upon others? He does it in what is possibly the most feeble way imaginable: He downloads a .exe. Then he proceeds to log onto a free computer game that normal individuals use as a temporary distraction from their normal lives and “beat them” at it. He does this all for imaginary points that are made completely meaningless by the very act he uses to get them and a sense of triumph over completely defenseless opponents. He  acts out an affirmation of agency over others that is so feeble it is literally more puerile than urinating on an ant hill (at least
in that case he would actually be snuffing out dozens tiny defenseless lives

So

He has spent a tireless eight hours doing absolutely nothing of consequence. But he has so many points to show for it, he thinks, by being so clever as to be able to search google for cheating aides and by being so psychologically devoid of shame or any notion of the fact that rules-based reward structures cease to have meaning when the rules themselves are circumvented. But then something begins to happen; tears well up in his eyes. He has the sudden horrible realization that he is so alone, so very, very alone. Somewhere, deep down, the fact that all of this is an empty masturbatory practice, is clearly apparent to him. But he has no choice

* Squad numbers associated with vehicles. It is currently impossible to see via map who is where once vehicles are being used

* Turret orientation markers in vehicles (like the lightning already has). As a driver I need to know where my gunners are looking

* Squad name listings for all squads in a platoon. By all means make it possible to disable if UI complication is a worry

* Command chat. The current implementation allows only squad leaders to partake. That is a seriously flawed design, or anyone with command chat enabled should eb able to access it at all times.

* A simple indicator to show whether a vehicle is locked to your use or not. Many outfits and squads lock their vehicles to squad/outfit use only

* Some way of assessing where everyone is. If we ever want to try and direct the zerg it is hopeless doing so without having at least some information as to where they are all distributed (although the VS zerg on Miller seems to make that somewhat easier by seemingly having a desire to button themselves up inside a base completely surrounded by enemy territory

* More informative objective markers on maps. For example, AMS's, infantry etc.

* Ability to illustrate routes and paths on the map for squad or platoon level information. The old PS1 ability to draw on the map was tremendously useful when trying to command large platoons around. Even better would be if these could transfer to the minimap (so you draw a route on the main map and it appears ont eh minimap

Take a look at this

To give you a quick summary: Pro7 Customers feel shafted

If you don’t entirely get what that means: The PS2 community hates you, you managed that yourself. 
Lets take a look at the last few months:

When the deal between SOE and Pro7 was announced, and players can play with each other, regardless of territory. They just have to use the territorial service. 

We told you to make sure to now screw up with the market place

Life was good. For a moment.

Then Planetside 2 release happened, your first one, and release for an MMO is usually a difficult thing. Some complained, but stuff got fixed and everything was fine. Just that nothing was fine:

http://www.planetside-universe.com/showthread.php?t=52855 

I don’t argue about the reason for the Ban


http://dk.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1cekr2/ive_had_enough_of_prosieben/

http://dk.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/16tdv0/noticed_today_that_prosieben_customers_dont_get/

http://dk.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1cehcn/in_the_meanwhile_on_shit_hum_prosieben_account/


And these are just a few example. There are many

The really important thing they all share: There has not been a single word from you guys. RadarX from SOE jumped into the fray at some times

Anyway

Its just another complain about your service


And that’s a problem. As said above

These are the problems:

1. Customer support: There are plenty of examples of your customer support being pointless. I'm pretty sure the community will be so kind and find them all rather quickly (do it folks. ;) ). Your entire CS staff obviously doesn’t know what their job is. Hint: Make your customers happy again. They approach you because they have a problem. They want you to fix that problem. So go


2. Communication: The community has a problem with you, and then approach the community and talks with them. Don’t expect us to come to you, right now we want you to get lost. You need to approach us, ask us what we hate, and then make things better. That means you need to be on PSU and on reddit, as well as all the other places. There is no such thing as a EU community and a US community. We are just one big community, the US folks, the Aussies from Down under and everything in between. Don’t make the mistake and assume that there’s a split


3. Promotions: Whenever SOE does something, nothing that could potentially screw someone over. Otherwise you end up with threads like above. Fixing the issue later by just giving people what they should have gotten in the first place isn’t helping much, that’s just damage control. The issue should never have popped up in the first place. But it did, and yet again we saw no communication from your side, until affected players approached you. 







That’s it

DO NOT blow up enemy terminals.  They are vital to taking over a base.  Infiltrators like myself can hack these terminals and allow our side to use them.  This can be crucial to gaining a foothold in an enemy base- sneak in, and BAM, you've got a spawn point in the base and have turned the tide of battle.

If you destroy these terminals

Today

So please, for the sake of the war effort, DO NOT blow up enemy terminals except as an absolute last resort.  They will do your team much more good intact than destroyed.

Now, with many item costs representing a significant investment of in-game time (or SC, depending) it's downright criminal to just not let us know what the upgrades do.

1. Why they decided to show 'bars' instead of numbers for weapons is frankly, recoil patterns, rate of fire, damage falloff (if applicable), reload time, etc. It's certainly a lot *easier* to understand than just some simple bars. Planetside isn't the only game that does this, but let's face it. The original Planetside (as I understand) was meant to be somewhat of a thinking man's game, given the FPS community's insistence on finding them through experimentation.

Compare

Similar for vehicle mods. Oddly enough, but I have *no way to know*. This information needs to be made available to players so they can make an informed decision about what they want to purchase with their certs, especially considering how long it takes them to earn a meaningful amount.


Now, it won't take longer than a week for them to figure it out. The internet is a relatively savvy bunch overall (when it comes to finding information at least) and that spreads quickly. Don't obscure the stats, let us know what we're buying into.

*That's bullshit.*

Getting killed by something a whole bunch usually means you're not approaching it correctly

So, and with some simple information you'll be able to kill the majority of average players when countered appropriately.

Some basics first:

*  **FLANK.**  If at first you're meeting fire approach at a different angle.  The shortest direction to your enemy is the one where the barrel is pointed at you; as long as you aren't abandoning hallowed defensive ground you should constantly be looking to get out of attacker's line of sight but keep them in *yours.*

*  Bring the proper tools.  Getting hit by ESF's?  Harassed by a lib trying to cash in that sweet sweet cert farm that is your hide?  *LEAVE.*  Yup.  leave.  And come back with the proper tool to tan his hide in return.  Grab an ESF if you're good with it

For the specifics...


*  Mag-riders.  They are highly mobile tanks that can strafe and, but quietly try to move to a better position and do so.  ESF rocket pods also work well.  I kill plenty of mag-riders in my drifter LA simply because the mag pilots have tunnel vision and focus mostly on aiming and randomly tapping WASD.

*  Liberators; sex pillows of the skies.  They can take a beating but the person on top usually has control.  If they're farming your spawn, a burster max, or even a G2A heavy and re-approach.  1:1 a liberator and ESF is a *fair fight.*  You want someone, *anyone,* with a decent reaver to just start pelting them from afar and they *will* back off.  Liberators are all show; they're not OP and they're not even amazing as a unit themselves.  GREAT liberator teams are a force to be reckoned with but they can all fall to a single moderately-talented ESF.

These are just a few examples

There is a method and counter for approaching everything

They purport to offer true liberty from oppressive forces and coercion.  While the Terran Republic is disparaged as a tyrannical and authoritarian force


But what is “freedom”?  As the New Conglomerate would have it, whenever you want.”  Someone is “free” insofar as there are no obstacles or barriers preventing them from doing whatsoever they choose.


Now


*Look at it.*  See how the fish flips and struggles


Before long


So I ask you again, it is *less free*, if it cannot honor the reality of its ordered *nature.*

First, and as a result the prestige of the coveted Indar capture grew to immense proportions. All the outfits on the server had fantasies of being the outfit responsible for the final cap, and, in secret, negotions between outfits and even between factions led to fragile alliances bent on bringing their own faction closer to that sweet, sweet cap. I can’t tell you how many times a primetime wave of brilliant strategic manuevers led ultimately to disappointment as our hearts lit up at the tantalizing possibility of finally reaching the full capture only for the rising tide of our faction’s territory to go out once again. Recently, on the eve of GU6, and on Helios the separation in faction populations had grown wide. In the early morning hours when VS and TR outfits were still asleep in their beds or waking up and heading to work their day jobs

For days the NC Indar cap bonus hung over our heads. It was our badge of shame. That is

At 10:00 PM on this Monday night an alert started on Esamir. We were outmanned as ever, no, they began pulling the continent right out from under their noses. While all the NC and TR platoons were occupied on Esamir the VS spread across Indar unopposed. It wasn’t until we were long into the alert that I realized exactly *how much* territory VAST had managed to capture. Only a few specks of red and blue territory dotted the map around the warpgates. It was at this point that I made the hard decision to pull our DPSO (Dropping Purple Smoke) platoon out of Esamir. The men were torn, but ultimately glory means more to us than certification points. We would free Indar.

The last few territories on the map were, we could at least remove the wretched banner of the NC. We pulled all of our main forces out of the TR territory, and began an assault on Arc Bioengineering, the final territory of the NC. 

It did not go as planned. We were driven out, and Highlands Substation with squads and platoons sitting at each. Some of VAST’s people began giving up hope and returning to Esamir, and with a heavy heart I began ordering my troops to do the same.

Then Leopardwood Nursery fell to the TR. 

I looked across the map. The TR had not moved to retake their major facilities at all. They hadn’t even captured a single territory towards their North; they had simply bee-lined it to the NC warpgate. EXE were driven with only one burning passion: finish the NC

I ordered my troops back to Indar. VAST recaptured Ceres Farms, shortly thereafter we broke out into killing eachother, but once discipline was re-established within our ranks we ceased any attack on the TR and turned our whole attention to the final push: we had to take Arc Bioengineering. VAST held the line at Ceres Biotech as wave after wave of vanguards poured out of the NC warpgate. DPSO led the final charge into Arc Bioengineering. 

It was hell. Reavers swarmed the sky. Vanguards and lightnings perched on the high ridge overlooking our only narrow avenue of advancement rained fire down on our approach. No vehicle could possibly survive: it was to be a slow crawl for our infantry all the way across the embattled dirt road and the heavily fortified bridge, inching up our sunderers whenever we could, medics reviving the fallen who scattered the battlefield. When we finally made it across the bridge to the cap room waves upon waves of NC soldiers poured out of their spawn at us, and the battle became a scramble to revive just enough of the fallen after every new assault to repel the next.

Suddenly things grew dire. Our sunderers were all destroyed. Our spawn beacons were all gone. Our medics began to dwindle. VAST reported that without reinforcements Ceres Biotech was surely soon to fall. Our capture progress stopped

Then the sky turned red.

“What the hell are all these TR liberators doing here!?”

“That’s our air support.”

Eight or more TR liberators soared over Arc Bioengineering unleashing fire from the heavens down onto the swarms of NC infantry pouring out of their spawn room. Capitalizing on this brief reprieve our medics revived as many of our forces as they could and we squeaked out the last few percentage points of the cap bar.

Now, the NC zerg may come back again in the dark of night and steal Indar unjustly once again. But at this moment the Indar cap bonus lies unclaimed. The shame of Helios has been redeemed.

1354728494.0,14bxeq,Sovrinn's Guide to Becoming the Greatest Combat Medic on the Continent,Sovrin,287,53,114,"Here are some great tips that will turn you into a total bad-ass. 

1. The first thing you have to do is change your attitude about your support role as a medic. You are not healing and reviving allies. You are harvesting experience from the dead and dying. *You are taking advantage of human corpses.* You have much more in common with nineteenth-century body snatchers than the lovey-dovey doctors you see on TV. When your friends ask you to come with them to help kill more people, I gotta revive this guy first."" Instead, you say this: ""Just wait, I gotta harvest some delicious experience first."" While some may be dismayed by the hordes of big, dumb idiots who rush out into both enemy and ally fire, you become happy, excited, sexually aroused. 

2.  Never bother reviving an ally combat medic. There's no sense in increasing the competition. The only thing other medics are good for is stealing your well-deserved experience. What kind of monster would deny you your God-given right? The kind that deserves to be dead. 

3.  Revive first, who are we to judge? After all, we're only in it for the experience. We thrive on the stupidity of others. Because your allies will always accept your revives no matter how many enemies are nearby, don't waste any time checking to see if it's safe for someone to be revived! (Unless, of course, you're only motivated by self-interest.) In the time spent checking, some other asshole medic could harvest the corpse of precious experience first. We wouldn't want that

4.  C4 is the answer to all your problems. As far as I'm concerned, casualties be damned.

5.  Are injured allies wasting your valuable time by running across the map as you chase them down with your medical applicator? Shoot the person in the back to get their attention, detonate the C4 to kill them again. If you have no more C4, shoot them. Feel free to repeat this process again and again until they stop accepting your revives. We have to teach them somehow.

6. I've saved the best advice for last. The greatest way to become a bad-ass medic is to steal revives from other medics. This is totally what you do. Once an ally combat medic has finished reviving someone (indicated by the dead person sitting up), because the dead guy's being revived will not be indicated by him or her sitting up (they're already sitting up once you get to them). Once the dead guy accepts the revive, you will get the experience and the other medic will not. The ability to quickly steal revives is the only reason to put points into your medical applicator! Note: If an ally medic ever does this to you, kill them immediately. Scum-bags who do this to *you* do not deserve to live. You're only allowed to do it because you're awesome.

So, great medic) in no time! Stay classy, San Diego.",,False,self,t5_2s48x,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/14bxeq/sovrinns_guide_to_becoming_the_greatest_combat/

The game isn't done, or the game crashes if x, y and z happens. Submit a bug report.

That brings me to my second point. **Submit bug reports**. The game will almost certainly have an ingame bug reporter where you pick a category, I don't want to submit it again"". SOE probably has interns or something grouping related bug reports. **The more bug reports they get for an issue, the more important it becomes**. This isn't always true, for example, a CTD in rare circumstances is a higher priority than a broken animation that affects everyone.

With bug reports, it gets flagged as reproducible and is easier to fix and test the fix. If you have some extra time, recreate the bug more than once so you can be sure of the cause. This isn't always possible though.

Please remember, because they assume it would work. You're job is to be like a regular player and do all the weird ass things that developers wouldn't think of doing.

Simply put they turn these grenades from **'items that work'** to **'items that might work'** (if you factor out player skill in not hitting yourself).

Where 'might work' is the percentage chance a player hit by the grenade effect has a protection implant.

This is a risk-reward situation where the player has *zero* knowledge about the level of risk they are entering into. Which is an incredibly bad way to design a risk-reward scenario.

In the first instance

In terms of game design the unknown and unknowable risk a user is entering into when dropping one of these grenades removes the fun from *both* players. They stop being fun to use (as anyone who runs into a conc'd room and gets immediately killed by someone with this implant will be able to attest after the patch) and they were never fun to be used on.",self,t5_2s48x,1374076980.0,,vs,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1ihb0y/the_emp_flash_conc_protection_implant_is_a_game/

* Thank you SOE for incentivising players to jump continents for this event. Ameresh is a fantastic continent and it was amazing to have such a large scale battle on it.
* Some of the details for the new stuff that is going to be implemented
* Another awesome thing was seeing Levelcap lead the vanu

**The Bad:**

* The stream was terrible
* More engaging commentary
* If you set an event ADVERTISE THE SPECIFIC DETAILS PROPERLY

""If this facility is in your Empire's hands on the most servers at the end of this 30-minute challenge

 -Yeah we are all familar with **this** facility

* Reset maps before events are held on them or state clearly that this is not going to happen so outfits can prepare before the battle

* If you care about the European community participating in cross-server battles then perhaps advertise the times for Europeans.

* Sit down and think why was the Vanu victory was so widespread? It does not matter what faction you play realize that if one faction dominates a battle like this there are some fundamental issues with balancing.

* Give people a reason to care about these battles

* Most facilities owned isn't different from most territories owned when you get down to it these are the same thing (different challenges).

1357875108.0,16cwf4,Sunderers aren't there just for AMS,Ivarr_Ironfist,273,41,111,"People only seem to use Sunderers for AMS. AMS is good but there are often 10

ADVANTAGES OF ATTACK SUNDERERS (AI &amp; AV)

- Although the damage is probably not as good as an AP heavy tank attack Sunderers have at least 50% more HP (more with blockade armour). A Bulldog does ~20% damage to the back of a heavy tank and you can get 5 hits off quickly.

- Sunderers don't have weak rear armour like a tank.

- They're much taller than tanks and are therefore better cover for repairing Engineers. The large HP of Sunderers means it's much easier for teams of Engineers to keep them up.
- You can use them to provide good mobile cover for infantry.
- They're more manoeuvrable than tanks.
- **You can spawn them at any vehicle terminal**. If you have advancing tanks near a small facility you can have the Sunderer there instantly. They're the only single thing you can spawn at a small base that is a threat to a (reasonably) good tank driver 1v1.
- **An attack Sunderer can go through shields with a gate shield diffuser.** They are the only ground vehicle that can provide good anti-vehicle and anti-infantry while that anti-vehicle shields are still up.
- **MAX units can get inside**. There is a reason tanks can't hold MAX units
- **They can carry nine additional people to assist in the attack**. Drop nine Heavies and or AV MAX units in the middle of a group of tanks and the tank drivers will shit themselves.
- You can be a back-up AMS and an attack Sunderer. Having an AMS doesn't prevent you from having effective weapons or equipping blockade armour/mine guard. If the primary AMS is destroyed you can take over.
- If you're carrying AMS you can deploy (in a convenient spot) to allow any member of your group to respawn on you instantly. (Assuming he tells you when his deploy timer is at 0).
- Bulldogs are kick ass anti-infantry weapons. Arguably the best ground AI weapons in the game. They might not one hit people like HE, hence, less time for a cunning infantry person to do naughty things to you.
- ESFs can't take you out in a single flight of rocket pods.
- If you're carrying ammunition or repair instead of armour you can be constantly re-supplying or repairing friendly tanks. You make it fr3ddy the uber t0nk driver happy!
- The driver is 100% independent of either the weapons

GENERAL TRANSPORT SUNDERERS

- The safest way to get infantry from A to B with maximum mine guard. One Engineer can't drop enough mines to take out a Sunderer with maximum mine guard. 

MINE FIELD CLEARER

- See last bullet point. Clear mine fields easily and without losing any resources. Bulldogs are also an effective tool for disposing of mines. Flashes are also good for this

VEHICLE REPAIRER

- The proximity repair system allows you to repair all vehicles near the Sunderer. Why is the better than an Engineer? Doesn't have heat. Repairs all nearby vehicles

SHIELD FERRY

- Ferry people through the enemy shields before they are down. Allows you to take from a direction the enemy might not necessarily be expecting. Allows you to take out key tactical assets such as enemy Sunderers in Tech Plants and the vehicle terminals in the bottom of a Bio Lab.
- You can park your GSD Sunderer half in and half of the shield

FRONT LINE TRANSPORT

- When the defence is good

If you've actually read all of my post (in which congratz, it's inaccurate and does less damage than a Bulldog per shot. The M40 does fire faster than the Bulldog and might pull ahead slightly in TTK time against armour but the difference seem to be small at best. The Bulldog, on the other hand, is much more effective against infantry.  I'd rather take the weapon that is more accurate and highly effective against infantry rather than the one that is slightly better against armour. This is just what I have noticed though, I don't actually know what the TTK times are like.

The M20 Basilisk is a bit of a jack of all trades weapon. It's okay at everything but not the master of anything. It needs a better re-fire time to be effective at anti-infantry and more damage to be effective at anti-armour. The anti-air is much better covered by an AA MAX

The M12 Kobalt is the high calibre anti-infantry machine gun. Two advantages it has over the Bulldog are less reload down-time and accuracy at long range. If you're engaging a constant stream of infantry or engaging infantry at range then the M12 might be preferable to to the Bulldog. It's also not a bad weapon for fending off ESFs (like the M20),False,self,t5_2s48x,False,,ns,t3_16cwf4

1354088174.0,13xa2a,So Higby answered a ton of our questions about future features for Planetside 2 in a stream today,BeefNoodles123,252,24,432,"So Higby answered a ton of our questions about future features for Planetside 2 in a stream today…

Here are the answers as best as I can remember (not word for word what he said):

1) Will exp be continent based instead of server? Probably going to change it to be continent based.

2) Will resources gained go back to being global? No.

3) What classes need the most love and have the most features coming? All of them

4) Sticky grenades for Light Assault? Probably not. We are thinking of designing the Light Assault to be more of a lone wolf player/1v1 assassin. We are thinking of making them have ammo scavenging tools. Like gaining ammo after each kill.

5) Will the Light Assault get recon tools like real light infantry? We've thought about that a lot, like spotting for artillery (he might be referring to orbital strike).

6) Will Maxes be able to spec to be tankier but lower DPS? Probably

7) Will the other factions' tanks be brought down to match the prowler's weak level? No. We are going to buff the prowler.

8) What faction's guns are the weakest? NC

9) Will there be camo bundles so we can just buy one camo and apply it to everything? In the future

10) Will the mission system allow for specific missions like ""overload this generator."" Yes. It will have broad and specific mission capabilities. There will be rewards for completing missions

11) Will mission system objectives have distance and direction markers on the screen to guide new players? Higby didn't actually answer this one

12) Will Auraxium be coming back? Maybe. Or maybe something similar. There will be big changes coming to resources in the future. No ETA.

13) Will other classes besides HA and MAXes be able to deal with vehicles? Yes. We will add tools so that more classes can deal with vehicles.

14) Will infantry be able to deal with liberators? Yes. Right now only air can kill liberators effectively. We want to add tools to allow infantry to stay infantry and still be able to combat libs.

**From Higby:**
**I want to clarify #14 because I think it missed the point of what I was trying to say.**

**We want ground to have effective deterrence for aircraft, maintaining air superiority is still going to be the most effective and fool proof way to be safe from flying threats. Therefore we want ground based AA to be effective vs. strafing fighters and high flying bombers alike, but not necessarily the best way to counter those threats. The best counter for Liberators should be friendly fighters.**

15) Will there be larger group units than the platoon? Yes. No ETA.

16) Will commanders be able to draw on the map?  That feature was built into the game

The NC push forward with one of the biggest tank zergs I've seen. Vanguards everywhere. Me and my squad whip out our engineer turrets (4 people had it certed) on Jaeger's crossing's hoverpad. We take out about 14 tanks

So instead of having an epic tank battle over a frozen river

Engineer turrets suck because:

- No warning to the insane damage it does. Just a horrible clicking noise

- Very low tracer. Won't really matter

- Bullet speed is extremely fast. Compare it with the HA rocket.

- Fast reload time

- Infinite ammo. INFINITE AMMO.

- Insane damage: 4 shots to kill a sunderer. You can turn a tide of a battle with two engineer turrets with two shots from each guy

- Camera guided. Unless you're tearing it up at 85kmph over steady ground that doesn't slow you down

- Extremely long range. The range is almost as good as the lancer

I've been a daily reader of this subreddit for 6 months or so now

For those of you that do not know, or spawned at a sunderer will now get a one or two second immunity.

Why is this bad? The main two points are 'choice' and 'cheese'.

Choice
Giving an invulnerability removes much thought going in to accepting revives. The ability to choose between where you should or should not drop pod or spawn
-If you die out in the open and there is a full out war going on, or worse - revive the person who revived you.
-If you are about to drop pod in to a hot spot, as well as how far along the capture is. If you see that the hex(with one base in it) is almost entirely enemy, with the capture bar mostly complete - and you decide to hot pocket in to that shit, then you deserve to die, instantly.

Totalbiscuit rants about it in his January patch overview video. I realize that just because TB says something, I feel I could use some help.

http://youtu.be/ugkKP1WttgM?t=9m51s

Cheese
It should be noted that spawn and revive invulnerability has been done in games before such as Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and Darkfall. In every case, I can already often get off total cheese revives.

Here is a clip from Bad Company which really... really shows just how stupid it can get

WATCH ME
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA6ZWCEYDQ0

I read this subreddit a LOT, in the time this announcement has been made, there have been DOUZENS of posts across all forums and platforms, pleading to not have it implemented. Lets not dumb down this game any more. 

With all of this said, they are actually immune to damage RIGHT then. It is only after they sort of 'move' slightly, and sometimes even 'drop' to the ground, that they can be killed. This is because whilst they are in a loading screen, they have invulnerability. Try it. Watch a sunderer, someone spawns, shoot the hell out of them, they will animate slightly

The same can be applied to drop pods which drop in hot spots. I play in an ESF a lot, until an enemy troop appears. They can then be harvested.

To sum up my rant

1360845061.0,18ie47,Mechs in Planetside 2 [Fan Art],SirCrazed12,316,89,245,"Hi Guys I know there has been occasional discussion about mechs in planetside 2 and from what i can tell there are some people that cannot bear the thought of mechs being added to the game. I never played the original planetside so I don't quite know how they were implemented there but I just wanted to show you guys how I think mechs could add a fun new option for players without disrupting the balance of the game. 


My basic idea for mechs would be a lightweight 1 person vehicle capable of dishing out decent damage but being fairly easy to take down themselves. This would make them more suitable for smaller fights and skirmishes as they would quickly be taken down in a larger battle.


The armour setup would be slightly different to tanks and other vehicles with front, grenade launchers, AV cannons and flamethrowers. An example of a weapon might be an AV specialized cannon which would deal approximatley 1000 damage per shot (aproximatley 60% of a MBT's equivalent) so even with two of these equipped you would only be able to achieve around 120% of the damage output.


Here is my idea for the Vanu Mech:

http://imageshack.us/a/img32/5521/vsmech.jpg
It would be the lightest mech of the 3 with roughly 4200 HP. MBT's all have 8000 and Lightnings have 6000 so compared to the tanks it's very weak in a straight up fight taking approximately 3 shots from most AV weapons to kill. It's defining feature between the other two mechs is it's locked frame meaning it operates similar to normal infantry or the magrider where it is always forward facing but has the capability to strafe. It would also have the quickest backwards moving speed and quickest turning but a top forward speed of around 40mph (the tanks are between 50 and 60). 


It's weapons would follow Vanu tradition being accurate with decent damage and little drop. There would also be the option to cert a dash ability allowing it to quickly reposition in fights. 


Here is the Terran Republics:

http://imageshack.us/a/img208/4985/trmech.jpg
This would be slightly tougher with around 4600 HP


They would be capable of dealing the most damage with the highest rates of fire or reload speeds but probably more medium to short ranged focused weapons. It's unique ability would be a charge allowing it to increase it's top speed for a short while but sacrifing its turning substantially


And Finally the NC's Mech:

http://imageshack.us/a/img543/6092/ncmech.jpg
In comparison to the others this would be much more of a tank with up to 6000 HP making it level with a lightning. It would operate similar to the terrans with the separated cockpit and legs but the cockpit would probably turn bit slower to give the feeling of weight. It would also be the slowest mover to balance out it's tankiness with a top speed of around 35mph and relatively slower turning ect. They would therefore be more suited to a bruiser role being more comfortable standing toe to toe with other vehicles in the game. 


In keeping with the NC's style their weapons would be hard hitting with a slightly lower sustained damage output than the TR mech but more usability over longer ranges. It would also be able to cert into a deploy mode that would reduce incoming damage increasing it's ability to duke it out in 1 on 1's even more.


Now that you've seen my ideas feel free to let me know what you think. I believe something like this would add a lot more diversity and interest to the game giving a vehicle which is both fun to use but not overly frustrating to play against. Due to their mostly squishy nature they would not allow for a single person to roam around and dominate and they would require a decent amount of teamwork in order to take on tougher targets or larger forces. 


I hope you enjoyed the ideas and pictures


TL;DR MECHS ARE AWESOME!!!!




**[EDIT]** Hi guys


Firstly there is the issue of people still referring back to the BFR's from planetside 1. While i appreciate your concern that it was presumably extremely poorly balanced I do not feel that there is anything inherently overpowered about a mech-like vehicle.


Just because a mech in one game was overpowered doesn't mean a completely differently designed mech will be overpowered in another game that is a huge over assumption with no logical grounding. While i understand the thinking that it is a mech so it must be the same as the old mechs I would hope you at some point get the chance to read the post fully. I've done my best to keep balance in mind as much as possible and genuinely do not think they would be 1 man owning machines like a lot of people seem to fear.


And secondly the issue of what role they fill in the game. I like to think for the majority of the time they would be used for a light vehicle support in areas that the tanks simply cant reach such as certain rough terrain and in tighter areas such as around buildings and within the larger bases.


They have the potential to use cover much more effectively than tanks due to their height and general mobility. While not as fast as tanks they are more maneuverable which lets them peak in and out better and just generally makes them much stronger in shorter range fights than the somewhat cumbersome tanks.


Out on the open field is where they would be weaker but still not useless. Since they are effectively glass cannons you cannot afford to be caught alone but when a few work together they would become a much greater threat due to their high damage potential. I think this would allow for some more interesting inter vehicle play than the current system of just buy as many tanks and hurl them at the enemy. For example you could have an ally buy a well armored sunderer and drive it right out in front of the enemies line drawing all their fire then have a couple of you in mechs emerge from cover to burst down your distracted targets.


I think this sort of high risk reward vehicle would add a variety of gameplay and teamplay that is different enough to tanks


Also they would be incredibly fun to use,,False,self,t5_2s48x,1360871987.0,,True

**The problem SOE wanted to solve.** The best, given that there were apparently barriers to being able to do so, and SOE rightly still wanted to provide some compensation to the affected players, they wanted to find an alternative. Today the compensation was distributed. The issue most people have is not that compensation was given, instead, it's the form and degree. These are the biggest issues with the handling of it:

**1) The ""sanctity"" of the certification point.** Excuse the hyperbole, while it is true you cannot technically buy certs with station cash, there was without too much stretch some harm to this ""sanctity"". Many people who bought items with station cash received large cert bonuses as a result. These large cert bonuses are then used on the battle field with clear advantage over other players. The issue here though may not be just that some certs were given away, but the shear amount, which brings up the next point. After all, station cash *can* be used to buy bonuses to increase your cert gain rate, but the clear difference here lies in both the magnitude and the sense that the recipient players did not ""earn"" them via actual gameplay.

**2) The magnitude.** By reports, it'd be a different story. But, as an example, there are level 1 alts now with 20,000 certs -- that's the equivalent of what BR63 players have acquired during their entire characters' lifetimes. There are some players who received far more, and to be fair, it's likely that the majority who received cert credits received less than this. The point is though, cert points carry significant value. There's a reason why all the items I've bought I've used SC for rather than cert points. *[note: according to Higby, but they've given a 100% bonus on top of it making it 2:1]*

**3) The bugs/randomness.** There appears to be a sizable number of people who received thousands of credits for free despite seemingly not even appropriately qualifying. These are the people who have only one character, but sadly, that's psychology for you. It works this way in all areas of life. Anytime other people gain something that seems to be unearned or unfairly obtained, if we ourselves did not gain that benefit and instead need to earn it through our own legitimate efforts, it's discouraging and tends to devalue our own accomplishments (our ""accomplishments"" here being the effort required to earn all of our certification points).

With all that said, but if for nothing else, SOE should approach anything dealing with certification points with far more caution in the future, especially giveaways that are tied to station cash transactions.

* No information on the outfits at all. 90% of the talk was breezeshooting about random crap.

* A cameraman who consistently got lost and refused to use the observer mode for the first 20 minutes or so.

Luperza and the rest of the FNO crew I'm calling you out here. Let's make FNO better, *get me to join the NCSC.*  

**Right so what are we looking at fixing here?**

**1.** First and foremost: Luperza, the conductor. You **need** to control the show and control the flow. Your cameraman sniffing glue? Help him. Give him a push to where he needs to go. I appreciate they're often new but letting him flounder about at the **wrong base your outfits aren't even fighting at** needs to stop. At least stop it from happening multiple times in the one evening. Yes it's cool to watch the TR shoot up shit but you're spotlighting NC. These people who often wait **months and months to get this spotlight** (yeah, TEST, I know how many times you got rescheduled on). Follow them, help them show off their moves. Don't waste this moment for them.

Secondly, lattice changes, personal opinions from people we don't really know? Drop it. Save it for after the spotlight during a player panel or something. The spotlight is for the outfit, what they do, how they operate. Yes, talk to them, but don't ask them about off topic frivolities and PS1 nostalgia or at least keep it to a bare minimum.

You're the reporter for the viewers. Ask them hard hitting questions and get the facts for us.

**Examples of pointless questions that were asked last night:**

""What is your favourite thing about Planetside? And what is your most hated?"" *Who cares? This is a soft and irrelevant question. Morbo disapproves and will destroy you.*

""What do you think we could do to change the resource system?"" *Irrelevant! Save it for a forum post or after the spotlight. Do a panel if you must.*

""blah blah blah


**Stuff you should be asking:**

""How are you attacking this base? ... Why does this work?""

""What's going wrong here? ... How are you going to stabilise the situation?""

""What are the most important points to hold in this base? What are the keys to your defense?""

""How are you squads currently equipped? Why have you chosen these loadouts?""

""Do you have any vehicle support? How are they supporting you?""

""Are you watching for a particular counterattack?""


See a theme? Engage these outfits to talk about what they're doing and why they're doing it. **Spotlight them.** We're taught in school about the 5 W's and H when writing or talking about an event. When where what why and how


**2.** Cameraman competency is a major issue. **Unless you're actively engaging and following directions as a squad member

Make sure your cameraman is following his platoon members

1365708845.0,1c5l5x,*UPDATE* On yesterdays cert grants,brorkanin,253,38,313,"Update on [THIS](http://forums.station.sony.com/ps2/index.php?threads/some-notes-on-todays-cert-grants.114869/) thread

Edit: Update 4/11/12 - 12pm PDT: 

&gt; Quick update on this. We've seen a lot of people under the impression that somehow the cert grant was broken or given to ""random players"", and pouring through virtually every character on the list we've found zero characters who were granted certs that didn't make the appropriate StationCash purchases to warrant those cert grants based on the above grant logic. Yes, that includes all of these characters with 20-100k certs granted. A lot of confusion has come from players who purchased bundles which contained items that had previously or were subsequently purchased on other characters on their account - these were flagged as repeat purchases and treated as such. If you think you do know of someone who did receive certs without purchasing any duplicated items, we are really interested in knowing more, and you can email me directly (mhigby@soe.sony.com) with that information and we will look into it. We are still compiling a list of players who did not receive cert points for certain duplicated purchases.

&gt; We've definitely heard the frustration from players who were not part of this grant

&gt; As a note

&gt; I realize this update isn't going to make those of you who are upset about this cert grant less upset

&gt; I want to emphasize that our goal on this grant, we will be reevaluating our policies for future compensations to ensure we have methods that do not cause the kind of impact to our player community that this admittedly has.

&gt; Finally

Tonight was that moment.

On Jaeger, the zerg rolled on Jaeger, and took most of the hexes. The Vanu and TR had 15-20% population each and were fighting over the hexes on the far corners of the map, and next to their warpgates.

My friends and I, while the main body took the northwest part of the continent. Joined by two other folks, we rolled up, cleared out the TR opposition waiting for us and set up camp. NS Salvage Yard is a hard nut to crack, isolated behind the TR warpgate, right next to an un-assaultable warpgate tower and only 30 seconds from the warpgate by tank.

And we held.

And we held some more.

For over 20 minutes, spawn beacons, Sunderer pushes, and rocket podding Mosquitos, we held fast the best we could. Eight stubborn bastards with nothing but our MAX spawns, rocket launchers, medics ressing, and an unwillingness to give it up. Our unpredictable zerg was pushing the corners of the map

Finally, Prowlers, and Mossies all at once overwhelmed us. We zerged the point, fighting back in a losing battle.  Trying our damnedest to keep that base until the last second. A lone friendly Liberator came from nowhere and bought us time before getting shot down. The bar shifted, and we lost the base. Picked off one by one, we all cursed out loud at our defeat.

But it was two seconds too late.

With a window of just two seconds

SOE has done

The reason so many people sit in their infantry farming loadout is simply because it gets them the highest amount of EXP and certs. Certs are horrendously hard to get in this game, when all you get is a measly 100xp for a liberator kill assist every time they bail, when you can get 100xp per kill on the ground infantry, who are way more plentiful, and easier to kill? Make destroying vehicles just as rewarding, and more people will be *hunting down the infantry farmers*. That's the most important part. You know what the best part about this is? No one will whine, since no one will realize what this actually does. It makes it harder for people to farm infantry since more people will hop into AA

TL;DR: Make destroying vehicles just as rewarding as infantry farmers

700 certs x 500 xp = 350, is about 2,800.

My point is, with prices ranging from 12,000 xp (96 kills) for a slight variant of the default weapons, such as a new assault rifle, to 120,000 xp (960 kills) for a game-changing shotgun. Now, weapons cost about 4 times that. Grinding for an expensive weapon was already a big deal, but with this upgrade

Does anyone else think that prices were quite balanced pre-patch, and makes this game pay for win?

Edit: To all of you in the comments who agree

Update: I see all of you who posted that SOE has a reason to increase the prices

These people aren't hackers

I'm going to bring up Delrith here as it's a pretty good example:

&gt; He got (temp) banned not because game logs showed him cheating

Wrong.

&gt; Why is SOE banning based on reports and not game log facts???

They are.

The CSRs don't ban people based on the number of reports they get from the /report function. What it does is set up a big red flag. More red flags that show up the more urgent the person is requiring their observation. They then go and observe these people and look for dodgy behaviour.

Why was Delrith suspended specifically?

**Stat padding.**

[Let's have a look at some stats.](http://www.planetside-universe.com/character.php?stats=DVSDelrith)

He has roughly 1/3rd of his kills from VS players and roughly 2/3rds from TR. Of all the soft classes most of them show a fairly 1/3 to 2/3 ratio for VS and TR respectively.

**Except for the Medic.**

Not only is there a huge

Now people seem to be freaking out thinking there's some automated ban system that works off suspicious stats. There isn't. It's all manual right now. What happened to Delrith isn't that he had some weird stat ping him, a CSR checked it out saw something breaking TOS and hit the banhammer.

Please read these posts by Moonlite

Reposting here in case anyone missed it on the forums and because there's been a lot of posts about hacking here recently. 

Let's clean this place up.

Edit: full text for those unable to see the forums for whatever reason:

We are extremely active behind the scenes 24/7/365 on those breaking the rules. We take it very seriously. Please can I ask you though not to /report these folks

To do this from inside the game do the following:-

Press Escape

Click Support at bottom left of screen

Then Ask for Help

After the browser loads in the dead center of the screen it has an 
""Open a Support Ticket"" link.

Then you will be required to log in.

Select Category as In-game Issues - Community Standards (If you do 
not select this your ticket may be delayed)

Please make the subject Suspected Rule Breaker or something as obvious

Please make sure you include as much detail as possible in the Incident section

Character Name is YOUR character name not the person you're reporting.

Make sure to press Continue or Submit and if you have done it successfully you will be given a reference number.

You will always get a response to your ticket this way. Doing a /report you will not.


From outside of game go to:-

http://help.station.sony.com/app/answers/list/p/5833

Middle tab says Open a Support Ticket

Then you will be required to log in.

Select Category as In-game Issues - Community Standards (If you do 
not select this your ticket may be delayed)

Please make the subject Suspected Rule Breaker or something as obvious

We will never tell you the outcome of an investigation because we do not disclose action taken on an account with anyone but the account owner

I hope that helps to clarify some points
Moonlite 

Another post a ways down:

&gt;sure

All 3 kinda.

/report doesn't bonk anyone over the head to say Oh a report just came in.

Tickets are higher priority. What reports are traditionally used for is when someone calls you a name that makes you cry you /report nastyperson which captures what they said in a state that cannot be altered by you or them and sends it to us. You then follow up in a ticket and say to us, but fear not Mrs. (Yes, there are female GM's) GM, I did a /report to back up my claim!"" The GM reads your ticket, pulls the /report nods her head while smiling at your profficiency and then smacks around nastyperson with a trout.

Only tickets give you a peace of mind knowing we are looking into your issue as we let you know we are

Let me know if that's not clear :)
P.S. I hope you have a sense of humour!

And additional bonus exp for all obj. actions done during the WHOLE siege would make a good reward difference between those who were actually fighting and those who just got there in the last seconds before cap.*

-The current Auraxium system promotes AFK resource gain

-Taking a facility seems less meaningful since the Auraxium is passively rewarded. A player directly involved in a base capture is rewarded the same as a player sitting in the warpgate (500xp is meaningless in the grand scheme).



**Solution:**

-Reward Auraxium for *any* area capture or defence. 

**The amount of Auraxium rewarded is based on a number of multipliers:**

-The number of facilities your empire currently owns.

-The amount of total xp earned during the fight for your empire (while tickets are collecting).

-The amount of xp that you earned during the fight.
 
-The population of your empire (to encourage underpopulated empires).




**Desired Effects:**

-AFKing issue is now moot. 

-Point capture and defence become a major focal point (instead of simply farming kills).

-Players are drawn towards larger fights instead of seeking ""easy"" captures

-Under-populated empires can now be rewarded for their efforts. 

-Base captures remain extremely important.

1355022419.0,14j34s,You hate Tankside 2? Here's some help dealing with it.,TriumphOfMan,243,45,123,"Let me preface this by saying, rendering

------------------------------------

So lately I've noticed several large [FFFFFFFFFFFFUUUCK TANKS! threads](http://forums.station.sony.com/ps2/index.php?threads/tank-spam-seriously-spam-ps2-is-tankside2.62179/) pop up.

**Here's some advice:**

Firstly let's make sure you're using the right gear to fight them:

**Default dumbfire rocket:** 1700 damage vs Tanks. You should be using this

**Lock on Anti ground rocket:** 1500 damage vs Tanks. Right now the lock on distance is so small it's not worth getting. If next week's buff puts it up to 300m or greater this will be great if you're volleying shots 8+ at a time.

**Lock on Anti air rocket:** 1270 damage vs Tanks. Don't use this


* Next let's identify exactly how these tanks are screwing with you. Tanks don't take bases and they don't win fights by themselves. Ever see a gigantic Magrider or Vanguard column? They're the merely harbingers of an *AMS Sunderer*. **That's going to fuck you. The Sunderer.** The tanks are going to try and use their attrition value to beat you back and create space for AMS sunderers to be safely deployed. This game is about logistics


* Are they shelling your spawn room and camping you in there? Again that's the spawn point game. If a spawn room is locked down then it's effectively removed as an option. You need to break out. Let's look at some options:


[Instant Action out](http://www.twitch.tv/buzzcutpsycho/c/1765563). Ever since the spawn beacons were nerfed (unwarranted in my opinion but a discussion for another time) this allows you to perform a similar strike. It can be a bit iffy


[Airstrikes](http://www.twitch.tv/buzzcutpsycho/c/1753692). Having a group of people falling back to pull an airstrike is also extremely effective. Don't worry about enemy flak

With your airstrikes consider the direction you want to attack from. Using an ESF's speed to sweep around and initially strike a column of tanks from the rear is [extremely effective](http://www.twitch.tv/buzzcutpsycho/c/1765622).

* Now assuming you're not stuck in your spawn room anymore let's talk about AMS Sunderers again. When defending a base you should think like this

1) Identify where the enemy would hide their AMS to threaten the base.

2) Identify where to hide your own AMS to best control those positions.

The capture points are incidental. This game is about logisitics

This is a key point. With the exception of bases like Techplants, Splitpeak and a few others you can't sit inside a base to defend it. **You need to defend the surrounding area**. Particularly points of elevation. In any attack or defense finding a point of elevation is key. It gives you great line of sight which allows you to put crippling fire onto any open area. Most importantly hills give you places to hide your AMS sunderers. If there is no elevation at a base like Indar Excavation you find the next best thing which is patches of hardcover. There's a reason you always see Sunderers parked behind those big red coral rocks. You need to defend these points and prevent enemy armour and Sunderers from taking the positions from you. To do this you need to place defensive AMS Sunderers at those positions as well. It doesn't hurt to have backup ones either. By the way if you've read this far props and put Pineapplesnapple in your comment if you make one.

* Now all of what I've said requires two things

Secondly, destroy the Shields, the Vanu SCU, Sunderers, and capture the base. With the Techplant captured a massive airstrike is launched on Indar Excavation and wipe the armour and Sunderers that moved up in our absence. The airstrike switches to a ground defense retaking all 3 Vanu controlled points and **defending the base**. Not recapturing, defending. Because we were fast and coordinated we could capture Mao techplant from start to finish and be back intime to defend the base we just left.

[PS2 Forum post](http://forums.station.sony.com/ps2/index.php?threads/bring-back-automated-turrets-from-ps1.56496/)

You can read my post for my in depth thoughts, but they should be accurate and operate themselves.  Also, they should retaliate when fired at (infantry included).

Currently, aircraft and ground vehicles are free to drive in and around your territory as they please with no consequences.  Being in enemy territory should FEEL like enemy territory.  Obviously a squad of vehicles and such should be able to take out an undefended base without much trouble, but this would further reduce the lone wolf mentality, and reinforce the idea that teamwork is necessary.

In Planetside 1, door locks, shields, etc).  PS2 has added loads of new ways to attack a base, but has removed many ways to defend the base as well.

**TL:DR** - I think they should make base turrets automated against enemy aircraft/vehicles again like in PS1.

**Update:**

This would also be another potential objective point in bases as well.  There could be a Turret Control Room in each base.  The enemy could destroy the control panel which would shut down all turrets

**Update 2:**

Other ideas I thought of and inspired from redditor comments.  Have the amp station provide the auto-turret bonus to make it more appealing to own.  An alternative would be to give all bases auto-turret engagement, minimum distance to engagement, and accuracy.  The tech lab could give more direct turret buffs for both auto and player manned turrets, such as damage, max health, lock on capability, projectile speed

Some of those things could be incorporated into engineer only enhancements that they can install with resources.",self,t5_2s48x,1354320251.0,,nc,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/141x2d/i_feel_that_the_automated_basetower_turrets_from/

First off, I thought it ran pretty damn well. I never had difficulty in figuring out what was going on, even with all the chaos occuring around me.

Level design was excellent, rather than moving across a more-covered perimeter. There is the concern with rooms that appear purpose-designed to be rooms to fight over(big empty box with a control point in it) which is somewhat disappointing, but given the scale of the game, I feel it's easily overlooked.

The game looks even more gorgeous playing it than it is to watch streaming. Weapons have a definite weight, and a couple more to figure out how to use your weapons effectively, so those of you going into the closed beta should be finely-tuned killing machines by the time the game is released.

The TTK seemed pretty reasonable to me. MAX units were able to take a lot of punishment, even while sprinting, and their ammo capacity[for NC at least]) is low enough so that you have to reload at least after every engagement, if not in the middle). I did go on a few terrifying murder-rampages, but it seemed very equitable to TF2's heavy in terms of killing capacity.

Class abilities are fun and definitely allow for some lateral thinking. When facing a MAX as a light assault around some pylons, before jumpjetting atop one of the pylons, and getting in the killing blow before he could react. Heavy infantry is the bread-and-butter assault unit, and it's a lot of fun to be able to adapt to any situation thrown at you, whether it's a magrider thinking you're easy pickings, or a cluster of infantry.

1367803844.0,1drk0w,MAX Units have stolen the role of Vehicles,Aetrion,321,126,224,"As the game currently stands MAX Units have pretty much completely displaced vehicles as the main source of heavy firepower in all armies. They have more staying power

The reason why MAX Units are simply superior to vehicles is because you can resurrect a MAX Unit. That means that it's completely impossible to kill a MAX Unit for good unless you overrun the position completely and make sure that the enemy team has no access to the corpse for several minutes. 

Vehicles by comparison can be taken out very easily at long range or with a suicide attack without actually having to push the enemy line away from the vehicle to make sure it stays dead. When a tank explodes for whatever reason it's gone


The reason why this really stinks is because the whole combined arms aspect of the game is really falling apart on this. Most cutting edge outfits organize around MAX teams at this point, they can operate in areas that provide their support team with adequate cover, and they can't be killed for good as long as their friends are still alive. 

On top of that MAX Units are cheaper to create


I don't see how the current setup with MAX Units being dirt cheap and infinitely resurrectable is in any way balanced with vehicles, and a vehicle does not"" - which may be true, but what good does that do a vehicle that's part of an organized outfit? You can do a little better without support, but if you do have support you only get a fraction of the benefits that MAX units get when they have support.

MAX Units have completely usurped the role of vehicles. They do a better job of it in almost every regard. MAX Units thrive to the point of being nearly unstoppable with enough friendly infantry support,,False,self,t5_2s48x,False,,True

I think with these commander/officer-like customizations coming in the foreseeable future

In my opinion

If you are *unwilling* to work as a leader

My proposition is to bring back the Command system from the first game

To advance in Command rank

* Leading a squad in a successful capture (requires you to be at the location/hex with at least half of your squad present)

* By setting up way points

* Through successful completion of (upcoming) missions in the mission system

* The amount of CEP will vary based on the amount of enemies located at the hex/control point before and during the capture (to discourage ghosting). The more enemies

* Any other ideas are welcomed

Note* Platoon leaders will not earn experience for every squad under their command

**Proposition on how you would be able to use OS: a combination of being a high enough CR rank and being a platoon (maybe squad) leader

*There can be lenience on things like squad beacons and being able to read command chat

These are just a few ideas. What do you all think? 

Just keep in mind that this is **not** the only way. If you can come up with a mix of both CR experience and certs

I suspect that one of  the reasons they cant keep population up is that many people just ""don't see the point"". 

And honestly

**Persistence**

Persistence is supposed to be an important aspect of the game

This is a serious issue because it completely undermines one of the most the fundamental draws of the game.

**New player expectations**

I don't have any data to back it up, and give them a clear goal and direction. 

When they don't get a clear goal

One is that, and give up. The other is that they decide to stick it through and learn the game, and what they learn is that there actually is no point to any of the battles, and that they can never win.

For many


**Player retention**

Its important to note that this is not just a problem with the new player experience, or they change their behaviour in ways which are bad for gameplay as a whole.

**Cert farming and player behaviour**

The more players who understand the game has no point, but rather to farm certs. 

A clear illustration of this is the popularity of the crown. Not only is it a good source of certs

Also, and encourages people to work against their own faction by doing things like keeping enemy sundies alive and letting the enemy back cap their bases rather than defending. 

In all, yet the certs you get from getting easy kills stay with you forever.


**Possible solutions**


There are a lot of of ways of dealing with this

That is to add some ""victory condition""

Pursuing victory would be optional, titles, or tags to the winning faction, or offer a small or large cert reward, or even small SC reward, or any combination of these.

  *Location : Auraxis

Somewhere out there far beyond this system at ease with their lives I have family. I doubt I'll ever see them. They don't know it and they most likely never will

It... helps to think about that. 

From down here

I killed a kid yesterday over a patch of land smaller than my old man's place back home. He must have been no older than sixteen. I was tending to wounded in Zurvan in the north tower along the wall after a particularly vicious New Conglomerate strike

I should have died.

 I was alone with the wounded and he was right there breathing heavily behind me, while my animal brain barely managed to recognize what was happening. I could hear him whimpering, as if he's never seen this before. 

I had a chance. I Threw my meditool over my back and spun on my heel and closed the distance between us before he could react while pushing his aim aside with my right arm and reaching for my chainbade with my left. A single round spat out of his silenced magshot only to ricochet off the wall and into the distance as my chainblade tore into his chest cavity.

 It was messy.

 What I remember most wasn't his final words, beaming with the naive innocence of youth and the firm nearly fanatical dedication to a cause even at the very end. It wasn't until I removed his faceguard to identify the traitor that I saw how young he actually was. He must have been born on the ships, never even saw Home, Auraxis being the only home he's ever known.

I suppose, seek some help and move on with my life. 

No such luck here on auraxis. 

This kid? I've started calling him Blue, ironically, his freedom comes at the cost of the freedom and sanctuary of humanity at large. I wish... I wish I could take the time explain that to him so that he would understand, but he made his choice and there is no room for weakness in the Republic, humanity depends on it.

But when the fight dies down and the defenders are trapped in their spawn room its very silly that attackers have to sit there and camp them until the timer expires.  If they leave

There needs to be an scu (or similar mechanic) at each base that can be taken down that (a) stops defenders from spawning (b) either drops the shields or introduces a pain shield inside the spawn room -to push the defenders out.  This would be beneficial to defenders as well as it would move them back to the next base and allow them to set up a defense rather than cheesing kills through a one-way shield.

I'm in favor of an SCU type option as it allows an outfit to Gal Drop back onto the SCU and bring the facility back up so that it can be recaptured.  Perhaps that SCU could only be overloaded once the base is a certain % capped and all points are in control of the attackers.

I am banned.  I have been banned for the last month and
I used to play on Briggs.  Mostly NC

By Request

Now

* I had a 12-month subscription
* I had the NVidia EU premium bundle unlocks
* I had 20
* (Total spent is around USD$300)
* I was not even given the consideration of having a GM look into these allegations

I was banned for 'speed hack'.  In my responses to the ticket I missed where this was stated, and I do not record my play sessions... therefore I apparently have no defence.

~~After realising that the accusation was actually speed hacking I had an idea about what may have triggered the statistic.  Driving a sunderer off a cliff in such a way as to land the wheels in the downward slope of a small hill which then gently levels out to flat ground.  This enables the suspension to gradually bleed off the vertical velocity without taking damage.  The upshot of this is that if you're not braking you can get a very momentary but rather large speed boost.  It is my theory that this is what caused the 'speed hack' statistic to trigger as I have little doubt I would have been travelling faster than would normally be possible.~~ Smed says this isn't the reason

 I haven't seen anything about the refunds for multiple common pool purchases for my retroactive account unlocks

I am grateful for account unlocks, then the topic just sort of disappeared from the Dev radar......

I would love to see the Reddit community get behind this issue so we can find out if or when this is going to be implemented? 


[UPDATED: There are ""no plans to do a mass refunds for multiple item purchases on accounts""]

So where does that leave players who were buying multiples still after account unlocks were announced because of the multiple SOE employees posting about refunds and ""solutions"" for those of us who had more than one item purchase?

1357233007.0,15w9at,A few quirks/little known info i've complied so far (more to come).,ylca,223,39,123,"A small list of a few quirks i've learned and wish I knew when i started:


**Voice/communications**

- ESC &gt; Social Tab &gt; Voice and Chat &gt; (right corner) Voice Options

- Each tab (General, Platoon) has a voice options section *these are individual settings for that channel* 

- My Personal Settings are Leader 50%/ Prox 60% / Platoon 70% / Squad 95% (reverses if i'm squad lead/ platoon lead)

- **ALT (Default) frees your mouse. You can mute people who are currently talking as well as immediately adjust their sound.**

- ESC &gt; Social Tab &gt; Voice and Chat &gt; (right corner) Voice Options

- Seriously
warpgate are tactical with the odd complaint/DJ. If you're inclined you can simply completely 
mute proximity and still be able to hear Squad/Platoon. There is next to no reason not to have 
voice enabled

- The voice over commands are bound to V by default. In particular V-1 (Thank you) and V-8 (Sorry) make the game a more pleasant place.

**SQUAD/PLATOON**

- press P to join a platoon or quickly access your platoon info. All the squads you see are actively seeking public members. Planetside 2 is a large game

- Squad/Platoon members show up as numbers on the minimap along with the color of the squad they are in

- If you are not in a squad [insert] attempt to put you in the nearest open squad in an area

- This isn't standard but a common sense voice priority would be Prox &gt; Squad &gt; Platoon with general chatter and info on immediate ground targets on prox, requests for armor/air assistance/squad leader coordination). 


**MAP**

- When hovering above a hex on the left side of the screen will be Region data. In the box a rough estimate of enemies is given  Enemies &gt; Squad &gt; Squads &gt; Platoon &gt; Platoons. This is useful information when planning where to fly or to take a small squad. Platoons Detect is almost always an indicator of a good fight

- In the filters Section Checking [Squad/Platoon] and [Allies] will give you more information on your surroundings. I believe there is a limit



**MINIMAP**

- Any unit that fires without a suppressor (not sure on flash suppressor) shows up as a red dot/icon on the minimap for a split second.

- All vehicles without the Vehicle Stealth upgrades appear on any enemy infantry/air/vehicle 

minimap (not just those with active detection upgrades) within a certain distance.

- Vehicles/Air With Vehicle Stealth will still flash on map as normal when firing.

- Solid stationary red dots/Icons on the map are glitched. All actively spotted vehicles will 

fade at least occasionally as the ""enemy spotted"" effect wears off and is reapplied.

HUD

- The minimap can be enlarged (default H). Usefulness is Air&gt; Vehicle &gt; Infantry due to differences in movement speed and the fact that large mode covers the bottom left compass leaving infantry without a quick reference.

- Under SETTINGS &gt; GENERAL [Draw Hud] can be unchecked for an interesting cinematic experience.

- Under SETTINGS &gt; GENERAL [Centralized HUD Mode] enables an alernate HUD view. Try unchecking to see which you prefer.

- The orange Arrow is your Platoon Waypoint. Green Arrow is Squad Waypoint

**GENERAL INFANTRY**

- Q

- Medics can revive your body for at least 20 seconds after you have the option to deploy. If you immediately redeploy when you die (especially on a sunderer) you skipping an opportunity to be revived right at the fight. 

- Related

- Cover is effective and currently too rarely used. Often an enemy will empty a full magazine into cover giving you time to casually step out and take safe shots. This will change over time

-You can set a personal waypoint by right clicking on the map tab. Many friendly vehicles have radar, looking on the map then dropping a point before it disappears again can be helpful.

Waypoints are also good for marking the location of an enemy assault or flank when you die. After death personal waypoints can be marked by hovering to the map tab and selecting manually (rather than attempting to use the death screen minimap).

**MAX**

- The engineer tool is not the medic gun. Movement while being repaired will break contact and lead to a frustrated engie. If receiving repairs *stand still* until you are healed.

- With an engineer you are almost impervious to a substantial amount of small arms fire and are larger in size than all other classes. As bullets cannot travel through targets

- MAX suits gain accuracy while crouching

**MEDIC**

- F(default) is both a self heal and an area of effect heal.

- The ability to self heal makes Medics one of the most survivable if they allow their shields to recharge between damage.


**ENGINEER**

- Explosives dropped stay until detonated

- Two mines will kill an base sunderer and any other vehicle in the game. Mines can be dropped directly on a target for a C4 like effect.

- Press B (default) on your turret to create an ammo pack. You can drop an ammo pack this way *and* use your turret.

- Your turret also doubles as a sniper rifle


**LIGHT ASSAULT**

- Jetpacks are usable at lower levels but really start to shine past level 4

- 1 C4 will take a lighting into critical damage (burning) 2 will kill any main battle tank and put a sunderer in critical damage.

- Drifter Jets have horizontal thrust and ski up slopes slowly but have a significant fuel reserve, Drifter for travel/open field combat.

- Currently there is a bug that makes jump jets stop functioning

**GENERAL VEHICLE**

- [PgDwn](default) is vehicle permissions. When locking to squad you kick everyone below that permission

- Setting Vehicle permissions to Squad allows squadmates to drive/pilot your vehicles as well. This is useful for moving a vehicle under siege

- The Expanded minimap is more useful to Armor/Air than infantry due to your speed. Air should consider almost constantly using the maxed minimap.

- **Every vehicle land and air performs significantly better with the first performance upgrade they choose (exception: rival only for sunderer).** The choice of frame generally doesn't matter


**ARMOR**

- Damage is increased by location

Armor &gt; Rear Armor &gt; Top armor.

- Vehicles can use cover as well. Use natural terrain to your advantage.

- Using cover and mobility vehicles can last for a significant amount of time

**GENERAL AIR**

- Spacebar is hover and will save your life

- Ctrl and C (by default) are descend

- **Aircraft do not need forward thrust to stay airborne.** All the aircraft are hover-enabled by default simply using the spacebar and the optional hoverframe makes them more so. Many pilots fly their ESF and other craft as if they can stall

- Your forward thrust is a throttle not a pedal. You can set a speed and leave it

- All flight functions need to be thought of in a 3d space. To illustrate this, but if you point your nose up and press hover you'll go backwards. If you understand how your forward and vertical thrust are pushing you you will have a significantly easier time learning maneuvers.

- To flip your mosquito slowly raise throttle [W] while holding descend [ctrl] and pitch down [bind a button to this the mouse isn't fast enough]

Having a new overlay that showed the number or concentration of friendly units per base could allow outfits and platoons to better coordinate movement and attacks and it would allow smaller squads and solo players to find out where the zerg is (or isn't). 

All too often I have used the enemy activity overlay and hotspots only to run into an enemy zerg with no friendly units in sight. A ""Friendly Activity"" overlay could lead to better use of the hotspot system which in turn could create better battles. Knowing where allies are should be just as important as knowing where the enemy is.

1349196561.0,10to2j,Why I am afraid that Planetside 2 is still ahead of its time.,Totalchaos02,234,56,248,"When people talk about Planetside it doesn't take long for them to mention how 'ahead of it's time it was.' It isn't an exaggeration though. The concept was amazing

Now we have the tech for Planetside 2 and it is shaping up to be an amazing game but I am afraid that it will still be ahead of it's time but for different reasons. Planetside 2 is going to combine two crowds that have conflicting points of view on how games do and should work. It is already beginning to show in the complaints and suggestions I see both here on r/Planetside and the official forums.

On the one hand, as anyone else. In an RPG, time means growth. In Planetside, time means options. This does not seem to sit well with them.

From the FPS crowd the persistence seems to make them uneasy. Victory conditions and instancing is the big thing I keep hearing from them. 'Why don't we have someone win everyday and we reset the continent?' 'What if we had arenas for infantry battles only?' These kind of suggestions have no place in Planetside. I am not saying they are bad ideas

I am worried that these two groups will just never see eye to eye on anything. Instead of a huge, will be sitting in the middle trying to show them what a brilliant game we have here but they won't ""get it."" Planetside 2 is not a game with a broad concept. It has a specific concept built on 10 years of Planetside and I am afraid that will be lost in the shuffle.

1362305449.0,19kl1m,"[Suggestion] When releasing new items for the full price, permanently lower the price of some of the old items in the same category.",DonMarani,216,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/19kl1m/suggestion_when_releasing_new_items_for_the_full/

as we all probably agree, and most items are just ""sidegrades"".

The dev team releases new items at quite a fast rate, and paying players (me included) have no issues with stocking up on SC and buying the good stuff when it gets released, because there is no other game that compares to PS2 on the market.

However, when new stuff gets released for the same category? 

* There would be no significant, and the primary revenue source is the release of the newest and greatest stuff like the pump-action shotguns that players trial and buy as soon as those hit the live servers just because they are new and cool. Again, nothing wrong with that.

* It would increase the excitement of the non-paying playerbase for patches that release new items - while those are not immediately available for the F2P crowd without a huge cert investment

* New players starting the game would not get the feeling that the game is ""P2W"" that comes with seeing the cert screen, and the barrier of entry is lower. 

This would make the game a lot more attractive to free players

To illustrate my point

* They release the new pump-action shotguns at 1000c/700SC, but they get access to a reasonably good shotgun for only 250 certs. Shotguns for everyone!

* The MANA AV turret costs 1000 certs, making it a lot more accessible to free players.

* Faction specific rocket launchers will come at GU4.1, the NS Decimator is unlocked with 250c/500SC (as it is a niche launcher anyway) and the faction specific G2G/G2A launchers only cost 500c/700SC each. Free players don't get the fancy and fun new launchers, but at least they have easier access to the tried and true lock-on launchers.

* People are somewhat pissed that SOE released a long range sniper rifle (LA80 for NC) or a new SMG, while lowering the first SMG to 500 certs and the first high-powered sniper to 250 certs? F2P Infiltrators would get access to a good sniper rifle and a SMG at a reasonable cert investment.

* We get the MAX flamethrowers for 1000 certs each, etc.) is reduced to 250 certs, and both Mattocks (and eqiv.) cost 500 certs each.

Free players would be as excited for updates as the paying players, but still good sidegrade weapons get cheaper for them, while the paying crowd gets day-one access to the new toys and cosmetics. What does the subreddit think?

**TL;DR: Lower the cost of some old items when new stuff gets released for that category. Free players get easier access to stuff paying players already have,False,self,t5_2s48x,1362305682.0,,nc,t3_19kl1m

1376480090.0,1kcbw2,Suggestion: Raise the flight ceiling.,youngavlol,228,51,158,"The current flight ceiling is too low. During aerial combat I frequently run into the flight ceiling

* When dogfighting

* Approaching a territory from a much higher altitude would give bombers
* With more space for aircraft there is the possibility of strict air combat becoming more prevalent

* And lets be honest

I also think that instead of just hitting the ceiling and being bumped back down, lengthening the period in which the aircraft is in a lowered mobility state. Thoughts?

**[EDIT]** To those that are mistakenly thinking this will make A2G overpowered: Giving air more space will not magically turn them into sniping Orbital Strike machines. The way ground and air can attack each other wouldn't change.

**[EDIT 2]** I think I need to clarify this even more after all of the comments about it. A hightened ceiling will not give air more of an advantage over ground. There are already MANY instances where I have to decrease altitude for my Dalton gunner's targets to render. *That's with the current ceiling.* If I can all of a sudden go even higher than that

Dive bombing ESFs: For an ESF to have targets to shoot at, and dive bombed it, you would still see it just as soon as if it came in from the current altitude cap. 

This will separate ground and air: How often do pilots pod infantry? A lot. How often do liberators hover around and pick off infantry and armor with their dalton/zephyr? A lot. These are the support roles that people are claiming don't get taken advantage of

Lastly; There would be too much room, the terrain is not level and there are problem areas where planes cannot escape lock-on and AA range. If I leave my warp gate, the immediate territories are too high in altitude for me to achieve a safe flying height. This isn't fair. MAXes can be revived, rockets are free, phalanx turrets have unlimited ammo, and planes have a cool down and a resource cost. (Yes, MAXes have a resource cost as well but they can be revived and a plane cannot.) 

For those of you who think ""We won't be able to shoot at every aircraft that tries to fly by without attacking us, spot it, inform some of your factions pilots, whatever, and let the people who can deal with it deal with it. G2A is not meant to be plopped down on a hilltop in the middle of the map or on the landing pads of the Crown and be able to hit every plane on the continent.

Many weapons get nerfs, for example, noticed the much reduced lock-on times for the striker in the PTR. Not to mention the rockets seem to fly at near 50% faster speeds than they do now in the live realms. Is this something they will keep? Who knows. 

I'm seeing all kinds of new and exciting ideas. They are (mostly) listening to their fan-base with regards to some things. They are actively communicating with us and keeping us up-to-date with certain things. It's nice to have. Many games we PURCHASE release, some of it I may not be a huge fan of but this game to me is still better than a lot of the crap that is out there.

It keeps my attention. I enjoy playing with large groups. I enjoy the longer base caps now to keep fights going! No more 30-second base caps and that is it. On to the next! No. It's nice to be able to actually have to WORK to take a base.

I think they have taken some great steps and some not-so-great ones. Either way, enjoy it!

This causes situations where a faction could be without any armour and air cover. This change would also allow warpgated factions to push out of their warpgate more easily; being warpgated isn't exactly fun and could cause people to rage quit (Possible customers leaving is bad for SOE).
A significant reduction in the cost of spawning vehicles would be required. I suspect this mechanic wouldn't be too abused by overpopulated factions as the distance to travel to the front line would be too big.
