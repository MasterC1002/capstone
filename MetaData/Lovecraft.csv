1339368920.0,uv7w0,How 'Prometheus' is basically 'At the Mountains of Madness' (spoilers),donald20,286,37,59,"I regularly listen to the H.P. Lovecraft literary podcast, I do not doubt this in the least. So

There is actually a major point to make, they were intentionally looking for something, but they just ended up opening a giant can of worms.

Alright, they are both extremely isolated (The Planet, as it will now be called, is a two-year journey from Earth) and they are both relatively unknown in their construction.

Both teams are composed of mostly scientists, Shaw, while Dire is a male geologist. For the most part, Holloway serves as the Danforth character for a time, but I'll explain that later.

They even have similar equipment: the Prometheus being analogous to the S.S. Arkham and the S.S. Miskatonic

So, while AtMM starts with some strange soapstone markings.

Eventually, while in AtMM they begin to discover some ruins of the Elder Things city.

Soon, they jump the gun a bit before AtMM; they start discovering murals and the language of the Engineers right away, while in AtMM, it takes them a while. The crew of the Prometheus also discovers the 'shoggoth' of this story, the mysterious black goo.

Soon, with a silica storm in Prometheus and a blizzard in AtMM. Two people get left behind in the Engineer's base, and they are forced to stay the night with no contact to Prometheus due to electrical interference. The entire away team of AtMM is cut off, though.

As they are cut off

Now, however, it was the black goo that killed the two scientists remaining in the base.

The black goo is pretty different from the Shoggoth, which slowly kills him. Later on, the goo and the shoggoth will line up thematically in a more distinct way.

Anyway, another is missing, and Holloway is eventually killed by his own request, thus ending his reign as the Danforth to Shaw's Dire. In AtMM, they discover the corpses of almost the entire away team, though one of them is missing as well.

This is where Prometheus diverges again, just an homage to the original Alien, and it didn't really have any connection to AtMM.

However, he does offer help to Shaw on several occasions.

Soon, which could be a better analogue to the frozen Elder Things.

Soon, the outcome was much more bloody, with the scientist killing about 5 people before he was finally put down.

Another divergence here is that the 'final' team in Prometheus is larger than the AtMM 'final' team. They had Shaw, while in AtMM, it was just Dire and Danforth.

At around this time, and the Elder Things made the shoggoths as a tool. However, both died at their creations hands.

Furthermore, the whole point of the movie was that the Engineer's would seed life on planets. It is also shown that both the Engineers and the Elder Things were scientists, and when they were reawakened, they basically freaked out about the situation and went, for lack of a better word, ape shit.

The story then basically diverges for the rest of the film, a creature brought about from the black goo attacks the reanimated Engineer ala the facehugger from the original Alien. It shows the final confrontation between creator and created, with the creator subsequently losing, much like in AtMM. And also like AtMM, only two of the main characters made it through the entire film; Shaw and David, who are the analogues of Dire and Danforth.

So

I hope everything makes sense,False,self,t5_2qjt4,False,,,t3_uv7w0

*I would certainly have loved to interview Lovecraft, he was unable to attend, although I was lucky enough to do so). The funny thing, of course, is that many of my own tastes and predilections have been shaped or inspired by Lovecraft--not only his own particular favourites in weird fiction (Machen, Dunsany, Blackwood, but such things as colonial antiquity, to soak up the Lovecraftian atmosphere of Providence
 
**What would you like to ask him if you could?** 

*It would be tempting to have a debate with Lovecraft on the matter of race (I am perennially amused by his comment in a letter of the 1930s, inspired by the turmoil in India caused by Gandhi), but I suspect we would not make much headway in the matter, since Lovecraft believed he had science on his side to justify his prejudice against blacks, Jews, and others. I think it would probably be safest--and, in fact, and I have quite frankly appropriated many of these in my own writings on the subject.*
 
**Given his own martial interest and Anglophile, that of the Somme, Ypres and Paaschendale?** 

*This is certainly a curious thing, that in the US (which was only involved in the war for a year and a half, in 1917-18) the effects of the war were not quite as devastating as in Europe, and Lovecraft, in his early creative years, did not feel that weird fiction should make explicit references to political, social, but they remain peripheral to most of the stories in which they occur.*

**Though we are aware of your idea in your work  that Lovecraft's early illness was more psychosomatic and that it was alleviated after his mother's death, cardiac weakness, early death and in some cases elongated limbs and visage. Have you ever considered or heard this possibility about Lovecraft?**
 
*I don't know anything about Marfan's Syndrome (of which, and it would certainly be worth exploring. However, some of the symptoms you outline (e.g., elongaged limbs and visage) don't seem to fit Lovecraft's condition (unless you are referring to his prognathous jaw, something he clearly inherited from his mother). I still think the psychosomatic explanation is more satisfactory, since the remarkable improvement in his health coincided so precisely with his mother's death (something he even alludes to in ""The Thing on the Doorstep""). However, more work on this matter is warranted.*
 
**Given all your extensive study of Lovecraft...do you like him?** 

*Do I like him as a person? Well, his racism). He was kind, generous (with his time and even with what little money he had), morally upright (didn't lie, steal, cheat, etc.), Do I like his work, I might even gain some new insights by a thorough re-reading, and even the shortest and most perfunctory of his letters has something of his distinctive personality. There were times in the past when I thought I was getting a bit tired of Lovecraft (especially when I was spending two full years--1993-95--writing my biography)

**It is popularly held that Lovecraft has been one of the greatest influences on modern horror literature, or any impact at all, on modern science-fiction as he has had on horror?**

*In answering this question, etc., but it never connected with me the way horror fiction did. But my understanding is that Lovecraft is indeed a presence in science fiction, albeit in general a covert one. Some science fiction writers have reacted with great hostility to Lovecraft: Asimov referred to him as a ""sick juvenile,"" and Avram Davidson wrote a famously ferocious screed that accused him of nearly every literary sin imaginable. I think much of this hostility (among Golden Age science fiction writers, at any rate) resides in the fact that Lovecraft's bleak view of the future (in which humanity, already dwarfed into insignificance by powers incalculably greater than they), Arthur C. Clarke has testified (in his autobiography ASTOUNDING DAYS) how much he enjoyed Lovecraft's two long stories in ASTOUNDING, and the work of such a writer as Charles Stross

**What was it that drew you to Lovecraft originally? Why have you developed such an interest in him?**

*I think it is a good thing to have discovered Lovecraft as a teenager--which is far from saying that he appeals only or even predominantly to teenage mentalities. It is at that age when one is looking for literature beyond mundane reality, vampires, and werewolves to be stereotypical and unconvincing, and Lovecraft's extraterrestrials--realised with such meticulous precision, as in AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS--seemed to me an extraordinary imaginative conception. As I learned more about Lovecraft, I was struck by parallels--some superficial, some more significant--in his attitudes and mine: love of cats, atheism (I was not then a full-fledged atheist, etc.)

**What's your favourite poem/story/letter?**

*My favourite story remains AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS, which to this day I regard as perhaps the single most terrifying passage in all horror literature. Among the poetry, it is difficult to discount FUNGI FROM YUGGOTH, but I have always had a fondness for the brooding poem ""The Ancient Track,"" which I believe I once memorised. And there is a touching little two-stanza poem (not a weird poem), ""Sunset,"" which I find ineffably poignant. ... It's funny that you should mention the possibility of a ""favourite letter."" There is a letter to Frank Belknap Long (Feb. 22, where it has been conflated with another letter of slightly later date.) This letter is not only full of substantial discussions of philosophy

**How do you think he would react to the seething mass of humanity that is the internet, and scepticism?**

*It is always a bit dangerous to pluck an historical figure and place him in our day and ask what he would have thought of modern developments. I imagine Lovecraft would have been disdainful of the Internet, and I imagine he might have made tentative use of the Internet to keep up on such developments. But of course this is all conjecture, and rather idle at that.*

**While you have clearly established yourself as the pre-eminent authority on Lovecraft you were once the new kid on the block

*I would certainly like to take the time here to acknowledge how much help and advice I received in early days (and in some ways even now) from my elders in Lovecraft scholarship, David E. Schultz (still my closest colleague), George T. Wetzel, J. Vernon Shea, Peter Cannon, and several others. As for younger scholars, I confess that I am a bit disturbed that not many of these have emerged in the past decade or so, all of which are highly stimulating. Another scholar, and Livesey has written some keen articles showing the links between Lovecraft's scientific enthusiasm and his weird fiction.*

That said

This has all been said before, of little to no real tangible relevance to Lovecraft or Lovecraftian horror (tentacles alone do not a Lovecraftian reference make).  The last few days have been busier than normal.

If you have some lulz send it over to /r/cthulhu

It's not just funny/lighthearted pics though.  Pictures of books are frowned upon as well.  Photoshopping tentacles to something is

The idea behind this is that there are innumerable subreddits that are either intentionally for funny or lighthearted stuff

Let's all try to keep /r/lovecraft a place for Lovecraft, rpgs, video games, statuary, buildings (we had a great post recently about the church that inspired Haunter in the Dark), music, et al.  Heck, possibly most of all

Are you reading something in the vein of Lovecraft right now or have you read something recently?  Give us a post containing a link to it and/or a review of it.  There are probably others here who have read it/are reading it/want to read it/want to learn about this sort of thing.  I'll be posting a couple of reviews tonight

Also, but not incessantly...so any help you can give in keeping the place tidy is great.

So in short: Lighter fare is for /r/cthulhu

I don't like adding meta posts like this one, welcome.  Some may not know that there are two subreddits, or that this subreddit is a little more choosy.  As a rule, the folks who post and comment in this sub are amazing and I am grateful for those who do so.

Calls from mods and users more inclined to the original sub-reddit ethos for a retrenchment or re-alignment are usually met with at best a shrug of the shoulders

Therefore the time has come where we must attempt a rebalancing. Both the new mods have been vocal in calling for better quality of discussion and submissions. They are not alone

The reddit rules on the sidebar have served us well with little change for over two years since KBPrinceO and 8-Mighty-Arms implemented them. But recently people have been completely ignoring the guidelines.

So before you post a submission please consider whether your post will add to or edify in some way the community. Ask yourself if you are simply karma whoring. Example submissions which fall very definitely into this category are Cthulhu (Lovecraftian) tattoos

Are you posting because you recognise only Cthulhu as a pop culture meme? Why not (and no disrespect intended to mod airbrushedvan) try [/r/Cthulhu](/r/Cthulhu) instead?  Got or getting a Cthulhu tattoo? [/r/tattoo](/r/tattoo) or [/r/tattoos](/r/tattoos) are your place. Made yourself a Cthulhu wool hat? There's [/r/knitting](/r/knitting)

These are general guidelines. Will we lose users as a consequence? Possibly but if the only reason they were here was karma whoring that's a price we're willing to suffer. We'd prefer however that they stay and learn more about Lovecraft

For example: subjects we do not see enough of which are always open for further exploration: 

Lovecraftan anthologies and reviews

Post-Lovecraftian authors

Weird fiction authors and Weird Fiction as a genre

Discussion of Lovecraft's many influences (Poe, his contempories and friends, 

There's always room for more original art such as user Duapo's excellent 2012 Mythos Calendar or original weird fiction

Thanks for your assistance and help in the re-alignment.

Here is the description from the sidebar:

With that in mind, fiction, nonfiction, music, films/video, rpg (like Call of Cthulhu) games, et al.  I'd love to see more serious content, watered down and vague concepts of Octopoid Cthulhu memes

First you'll need a Fantasy Flight [Bag O' Cthulhu](http://www.amazon.com/Call-Cthulhu-LCG-Bag/dp/1589946006/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1333553550&amp;sr=8-1).


Ok

1. Take one of the larger ones, file it off. Best do that at the start.

2. [Drill a hole up through the centre and glue some brass rod into it.](http://i.imgur.com/QDzmi.jpg) Make sure to add a twist at the end of the  rod. This is to give the putty something to grab onto in the next step. Oh, I forgot to do it until after step 4.

3. [I had a bit of lead in the garden so I cut it into slivers and hot-glued it around the rod](http://i.imgur.com/YXaVK.jpg), wheel-balancing or fishing line weights.

4. [Next further build up the base with air-drying two part epoxy putty](http://i.imgur.com/LaXQY.jpg). I used Milliput White

5. I cut some simple glyphs into the base with a mini drill engraver head

6. [Spray the whole thing black in a few light coats](http://i.imgur.com/np1dE.jpg).

7. The CoC description of colour of course difficult: *a green stone colour with gold flecks like nothing ever seen on earth*. Green it is so.

8. [Mix a couple of acrylic greens and/or blue/greens. Add some black to make a dark green](http://i.imgur.com/iTxMn.jpg). Don't mix the paint uniformly but leave different streaks. Dry brush it on with a flat brush. In dry brushing

9. I added a final highlight of a bright bronze acrylic mixed with green as a final highlight. Hit it with a couple of light coats of spray varnish. Finished statue is ~~6 inches~~ 10.5 cm high. The key to making it feel right is the weight we added when making it

Never again. 

I don't think I could bear the burden of their understanding - or rather, you I can tell. I am free to paint a mural of text for your edification because we shall likely never meet. If by some unholy coincidence and we should lock eyes and mutually recognize that terrible *knowledge* burning in our souls, I shall have met a kindred spirit, rather than the personification of my guilt.

And so I will honor your request

Most days, and continue with my day as everyone does. I eat, I work, I play, I sleep - in short, I live my life. Oh, there are concerns - I worry about my father's recovery from surgery, I am annoyed and disappointed if I burn dinner - but if everything is not perfect

Some days, but rather a miasma seeping through the porous skin of reality. I truly believe all people can sense this, but as a species we have learned ignore this ability - deliberately allowing it to atrophy in order to ensure our survival. The withered remnant of awareness is buried deep beneath the conscious mind, and lucky are they for whom it remains interred. 

Some of us are not so blessed. 

Trauma may wake it, ""you gaze into the abyss, and the abyss also gazes into you."" He must have been one of us.

When the cloying miasma seeps into existence, praying that the manifested nothingness does not find us. We impose upon ourselves a strictly enforced amnesia and avoid anything that might recall us to the horrifying presence of the abyssal tendrils blindly seeking us out. 

When the shadow passes

Fools.

One cannot help but realize this reprieve is temporary

There will come a time when all preparations are insufficient - when the looming presence infilitrates my defenses and encroaches on every mote of my awareness. My body will continue to exist, breathing being is but a husk, occupied by a decaying imprint of who I was. As for myself, I fear that I will remain aware as my will is slowly picked away, each memory individually degraded and discarded as I am digested by oblivion. 



Now that you know the nature of the ""illness"" I believe you will agree that it is quite incurable. 

Do have some more tea.

My personal belief is that (at least his better known works) work on a scale too grand to be viscerally terrifying.  Maybe it's my own temperament.  It's just that when I read a ghost story, maybe there's a ghost in my house.  But when I read about Cthulhu, no part of me is worried that there's a Cthulhu in my basement.  Is that a defect in my character?  Do you get scared reading those tales the way you get scared reading about a poltergeist or MIB encounter?

And a follow-up question: what HPL stories scared you the most?  I just got his complete works and I'm done with school.

He says they are mad and emanate evil, becoming bored, malignant and eventually insane from it. As far as emanating evil, I think they either have this as some sort of mental ability or that their appearance was just so alien to men of his time as to be utterly frightening and even beyond comprehension. I think their emanations of fear would be negated by a sufficiently scientific, rational mind or by someone who is already mad in some fashion, so that the fear does nothing to warp their mind.  We must remember that science was in its infancy when he wrote these stories, and that his purpose in writing was to induce the very fear and apprehension that his gods supposedly would emanate

The thought of immortal alien races far more advanced than our own and having agendas that ignore us or are not in our interests makes perfect sense. so does their madness over time

Never do you learn what this entity actually is, but you can at least reason that Azathoth is the center of the Universe, somehow the incarnation of its indifferent vastness and arbitrary destruction. In a way, it *is* the Universe, its ""true spirit"" or whatever. Yog-Sothoth is the Gate and The Key, the one who brings and/or binds realities/dimensions together, in this respect it is possibly even *more* powerful than Azathoth.

1340905330.0,vr1j2,Lovecraft's xenophobia,linuxlass,56,10,27,"I did a little digging about *The Street* and found some discussion about Lovecraft's motivations. To me, if this is the source of the note of disapproval in *Mountains of Madness* where he talks about the ""decadence"" of the bas reliefs on the walls - that the Old One's culture was eroded and that led to their downfall.

I find it interesting, and that it is a great wrong to interfere with a person's connection with their culture.

Some quotes from Lovecraft's letters:

&gt;In other words, emotions, beliefs, points of view, etc., we are simply bundles of nerve-centres without materials for coherent functioning. Unless there exists an English world for us to live in, our total equipment of interests, standards, and so on—everything, and forming only a source of illimitable misery. Of supreme importance


&gt;Nowadays we need more than the mere fact of being English in heritage and speech in order to keep so. We need the added and positive factors of being consciously and symbolically so, we must have the positive English ideal of quality and refinement to pit against it. We must have a rallying point of our emotional life in order to prevent the disorganising influences around us from recrystallising our milieu into definitely hostile and repulsive shapes. 

&gt;I hate the rebels of 1775 because they commenced a wreckage which is making their territory unfit for their descendants to live in. 

&gt;Within the lifetime of people now middle-aged

&gt;The loss of a collective life—of a sharing of common traditions &amp; memories &amp; experiences—is the curse of the heterogeneous northeast today. There is no real solution--&amp; all the American can do is to forget about the foreigners as much as he can

(**EDIT**: I just want to make it clear that I have no emotional investment in the question of whether or not Lovecraft was ""really"" racist. If he was, I think racism comes in degrees, and can have varied origins, and it can be worthwhile to examine the nuances of an author's writing, in an attempt to understand him and his work better.)",,False,t5_2qjt4,True

The thing that struck me while looking at visual representations of Lovecraft on the web is that I found that Cthulhu is way over represented compared the rest of the author's invented deities but also compared to how often he's mentioned within the author's overall literary output.  

When you examine Google trends you find that, with just Nyarlathotep and Azathoth included, Nyarlathotep scores a 36 while Azathoth scores a 21.  Perhaps we could account for a higher Nyarlathotep score because of Lovecraft invokes him in his stories more often but I'm still struck by Azathoth's relative underrepresentation among fans.

When you look up Azathoth and Cthulhu on DeviantART you find a similar disparity.  There are 30

Lovecraft did place Azathoth at the top of his invented gods' hierarchy and supposedly he was the source of deities such as Nyarlathotep, why do you think Azathoth is so underrepresented and do you see this as continuing indefinitely?  Is Call of Cthulhu such a popular story that it overwhelms the rest of Lovecraft's tales within this little subculture of fans?  Perhaps Lovecraft's literary circle and immediate followers did more to seed Cthulhu through references within their own works to the neglect of the author's other creations.

My argument: 1. Alien shows that we aren't alone in the universe, similar to the cultists in Lovecraft's fiction. 3. Sexual horror, there is definitely a sexual undercurrent to the Alien. Its head is phallic, the face huggers and chestbursters are reminiscent of rape. There was a sexual undercurrent to Lovecraft's work as well, many of his monsters share a vaginal motif.
Her argument: 1. Psychological vs. Physical: She argues that the Alien is an archetype of predator horror, unlike the old ones. 2. She argues there is no sexual aspect to the Alien. Her words: ""Yeah the head is phallic, so are their guns."" 3. She also argues that there is no apocalyptic threat in Alien. The movie is about the crew's attempt to survive not prevent the old ones from stir frying the planet.

Written in 1928, particularly The Great God Pan (which is mentioned in the text of ""The Dunwich Horror"") and ""The Novel of the Black Seal"". Both Machen stories concern individuals whose death throes reveal them to be only half-human in their parentage. According to Robert M. Price, ""'The Dunwich Horror' is in every sense an homage to Machen and even a pastiche. There is little in Lovecraft's story that does not come directly out of Machen's fiction.

Lovecraft took pride in ""The Dunwich Horror"", snapped it up, sending Lovecraft a cheque for $240, equal to $2800 in modern dollars, the largest single payment for his fiction he had received up to that point.

These were the days when every high schooler was using programs like Kazaa and Limewire to share music and images. I don't remember what I was searching for

The introduction explained the story of the mad monk Abdul Alhazred and nowhere explained that the contents of the book were a work of fiction (I would finally learn who HPL was years later.) The bulk of the book was a collection of thirty some odd demons and the proper spells to summon their power for specific uses. Memory fails me, place a red candle in a northward facing pentagram, sprinkle salt around the edge and recite this chant..."" I never tried any of the spells because I was often lacking in the ingredients.

The night I printed the Necronomicon, I developed an inexplicable, itchy, bumpy rash that spread to every inch of my body. My mom, a nurse, rarely worried for me, but was freaking out by day three when I had a 104 fever and uncontrollable itching. 

I explained my weird illness to my friend over IM and he jokingly suggested it was because I had a copy of the Necronomicon. It was funny but, it almost made sense. I snuck out of my house with my printed copy of the tome and a lighter to meet my friend at the ditch behind my house. We were going to ritualistically destroy the infernal book. To a couple of sixteen year old boys, ""ritualistically destroy"" meant ""light on fire."" 

We found a spot out of sight from the public and began to burn the pages. It was only overcast in the sky, we tore it into a million tiny pieces and buried it in the sand beside a sewer pipe. 

Maybe it was all a psychological thing

I read my first HPL story (The Music of Eric Zahn) when i was twenty and was immediately hooked. It was only after reading a few more of his stories that I recognized the common themes, and ultimate resolution of the consequences without a satisfactory explanation, that I realized I had experienced something very similar to these characters, albeit to a somewhat lesser degree.

Winnow with giant arms the slumbering green.

In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die.

1347739228.0,zxtkd,HP Lovecraft's 'The Aristocrats',magwier,40,5,6," 

There is a joke comedians tell each other called the Aristocrats

*The setup: The joke always begins with a family act going in to see a talent agent.*

*Those who meet the agent can include the whole family or just one family member (usually the father).*

*The agent asks what they do (sometimes after saying that he is not interested

*If the whole family is present

*2.The act: It is described in as much detail as the teller prefers.*

*While most tellings follow one of a few basic forms

*Traditionally, and ribald The goal is to significantly transgress social norms. Taboo acts such as incest, rape, coprophilia, coprophagy, beastiality and murder are common themes.*

*3.The punch line: The shocked (or intrigued) agent asks what the act is called
 
You may have heard this joke or a variation this joke and not realized it was a secret handshake for comedians. I know I had never heard of it and I had tried to be a stand up comic in my younger days. (The less said about that the better.) The idea is to have your version outdo the previous tellings in vulgarity. Bob Saget explained that the beginning and end of the joke is set

Now you may wonder what the Hell this has to do with Lovecraft
 
Consider the way many of our favorite stories go;

1.The setup: The story begins with a protagonist

In many cases the story is told in the first person viewpoint.

The protagonists own tale is frequently told in a nested format with other people’s stories making up his tale. The final part of the Call Of Cthulhu is a good example of this; the main character never sees Cthulhu in the gelatinous flesh

The more our hero learns the more of what he thought to be the rational world falls away.

2.The investigation: The protagonist is frequently exposed to a secret society

The protagonist then either encounters undeniable evidence of the Mythos or an actual creature of the Mythos. The encounter could be with an established aspect or creature or could be a entirely new creation but this is the part that has the most elements of the author's imagination and style.

3.The Conclusion The protagonist has his worldview utterly shaken

""What is CthulhuTech?
CthulhuTech is an innovative storytelling game that started out as a combination of two popular genres. The first was that of cosmic horror, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and Rahxephon. But the setting has grown far beyond what it started out to be. CthulhuTech is now a truly unique hybrid of genres – cosmic horror, anime, post-apocalypse, traditional horror, and science fiction blended together seamlessly.

Ultimately, Humanity has created an inexhaustible power source that has revolutionized the world. Hand in hand came greater cosmic understanding and the acceptance of what was once thought to be magic. Our blossoming power brought an alien race that had hidden amongst us into the foreground as they descended upon Earth to enslave or destroy us. Celestial mechanics have brought ancient sleeping gods back into our world. The Aeon War rages and three-quarters of the people on Earth have been wiped out. But, combined with the might of unexpected allies, the New Earth Government makes certain that we will not go gently into the dark night.

It is in this rich setting that players take on the roles of hot-shot mecha jocks, who have psychically attuned themselves with giant cybernetic monsters, knowledgeable occult scholars and powerful sorcerers, who use an understanding of the hidden world and cosmic laws to bring eldritch power against our enemies, brave combat soldiers, fighting where giant machines cannot, and frightening Tagers

Built on Framewerk
Gone are the days that hobbyists wanted intricate

Framewerk, it is cinematic, exciting, and puts destiny back in the hands of the player. Its easy to grasp nature makes the game straightforward to learn and quick to start. Its clever dice mechanics make even the simplest of task resolutions exciting.""


**TL:DR** Cthulhu Tech is an amazing game where you fight lovecraftian horrors in mechs or in bio-mech made out of lovecraftian horrors. While that sounds a little silly the execution is very well done and you get a definite sense of horror.
So go grab your free PDF and enjoy!

I have no affiliation to this company or it's product. I simply love the game and want to share it with everyone.
