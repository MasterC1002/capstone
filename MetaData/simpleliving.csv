I feel that before I go on, these were the last two things that gave either of us a real sense of “bonding.” So January rolls around and the eventual messy breakup finally comes to fruition, leaving me in an emotional state of turmoil and depression. So how does one cope with their time after spending every waking moment with the same person for three years? T,V,, beer, and shitty food. So commence the routine of work, Netflix, with no girlfriend or real reason to give a shit. I deleted every form of social media I was connected to as a way to distance myself from my ex

March, which brought me to the other great subs of r/simpleliving, r/frugal, and r/anticonsumption. I was really taken away by the content and began consuming month’s worth of self posts and articles about the steps others had taken to break through the same depressive slump I had found myself in. Soon, I began to look at this T.V. that I owned as more of a hindrance than the prized possession I hoped would impress my friends and family when they came over. So I made the decision to sell it, and then I would rationalize against it, and go back and forth. “Man, I should keep it.””No one will want to come over here and hang out if I don’t have a T.V. to entertain them.” This was how I legitimized not selling. Then came that realization that I described in the original post….I was mediocre at so many things except watching T.V. I could dedicate hours to watching T.V.

So now here I am a little over two months later. The first thing I did after dumping the T.V. was use the money to fund a trip to the West Coast. In May I went on a two week road trip across the country hiking, Portland, the Boise National Forrest, and numerous craft breweries throughout the Midwest. I got home and a week later decided that I wanted to keep living, so I headed off to Bonnaroo for a week and got weird. Honestly, it wasn’t the T.V. as much the routine and failing relationship that prevented me from doing the things I’ve wanted to do with my life. I’ve lost 25 pounds since March as I returned to the gym and running. I quit eating pizza every week and drinking every weekend. I really haven’t progressed on my banjo as well as I wished to have, but that is a work in progress. I am still at the same job

All in all I would say that electronic distractions as a whole, but never do. You find that the extra time you have is unlimited in possibilities. T.V. time to me has become no different than all the aggregate time I’ve wasted browsing Reddit or Facebook on my smart phone while hanging out with my friends, or watching a concert through a screen because I felt capturing the moment was more important than living in it. I didn’t take my phone to Bonnaroo, I turn it off now when I’m with my friends and I actively protest social gatherings morphing into YouTube parties. The return to social interaction and the physical and mental stimulation of returning to the trails, the fret board, and the weight room are what brought me out of the year long funk I had fallen into. Getting rid of the T.V. wasn’t a means to an end; it was just the spark that lit the fire under my ass to get back to living. I don’t want to rationalize things any longer because of the comfort, ease, I want to take the hard way and I want own it.

And making games (I recently published one on the app store, but I don't have much time/energy to make others with everything else I have going on). And writing/researching about things I care about, and reading and learning, and a dozen other things.

But I give forty hours a week to my job. When I include the commute and mandatory lunch hour, like everyone else, I have to carefully discriminate where my personal time goes, and I'm neglecting far more hobbies and interests than I'd like.

“By itself, it kills bacteria more effectively than any commercial cleaner. 

Susan Sumner, published the following formula in Science News. 

Purchase a bottle of 3 percent hydrogen peroxide and a bottle of plain white or apple cider vinegar. Pour each liquid into its own spray bottle. Spritz the item to be disinfected with both the vinegar and the hydrogen peroxide

 Using one mist right after the other is ten times more effective than each spray by itself and more effective than mixing the vinegar and hydrogen peroxide in one spray bottle. 

Tests at VPI found the two sprays used together killed virtually all Salmonella

*Cost*

Futon was $20 at a local thrift store!!! It's so soft and comfy. SO's desk was $20 from the same thrift store. Rug was found. (all 'found' things come from my building's recycling room. People just put their old stuff in there I usually get first dibs because I live across the hall from the recycling room. Muahaha) Milk crates were found. This type of shelving was something that I always wanted. I love the look. My desk is from Craigslist - $20 delivered. Bench and SO's chair are from Goodwill. My chair was found on the side of the road &gt;_&gt; TV cabinet was a dumpster dive find (my fist and only. I'm so proud) 

**Bathroom**

It's so big and spacious. I don't get it. I store all of our 'seasonal' (aka hats, etc) in a milk crate beside the dresser.

I also have a storage unit that is roughly 3'x7' on site. It houses two plastic totes full of blankets

I see many posts here about minimal square-footed living spaces

Would ditching a car make my life simpler? It introduces extra stress to coordinate ones live around public transportation which is spotty at best where I live. I bike to work when the weather is nice

47 days ago I vowed to go 30 days with no cola, which surprised her and it led to a long conversation about my goals. 

I showed her my record sheets and she, decided to give my scheme a try as well. I cautioned her to keep her goals simple. You can't effect change by making it too complicated to work through. From day 30 to 40 I really struggled with this and I finally just said to hell with it and cut out a few of the goals I added to my plan at day 30. It was a quest to get back to the simplicity of eating properly and not spending my money like a drunken sailor that carried me from day one to day thirty. 

My camera is missing, I think if you keep it simple, you have a means of organizing your habits to reduce the stress they give you.

Being overweight and nearly diabetic is giving me stress. Having high blood pressure and always being broke was giving me stress. I've lost weight, anything worth having is also worth working for.

Choose goals that are not out of your reach, but come day 11 things start feeling like you piano on your back. So while it might seem easy at the beginning, it can be a real ballache later on. Keep it in mind when you write you goals out. I recorded all the results because it is deeply satisfying to me to see the days add up and up on my weekly planners. 

It gives me something tangible to look at and feel good about when I'm having one of those craptastic days. By writing down all the urges to eat poorly and drink cola I have gotten a better handle on the emotions that surround my poor choices. It also gave me an insight into my impulsive nature in terms of my lack of frugality. A frugality that I've much improved since I've begun this by starting to write shopping lists and asking careful questions of myself when I'm about to purchase something. 

I highly encourage writing goals and recording the results

I take the terminology passive and productive from context of  English as a Second Language Teaching theory. Passive being listening and reading and productive being speaking and writing. Ideally you need a balance of all four to become successful in being a well rounded student. Why has our entertainment sources become so lopsided towards passive entertainment?

I'm curious about this because I did an inventory of sorts as to how my time is being spent on what sort of entertainment. I found myself watching so much tv that I was a bit surprised. Not that I think watching TV is bad

Is there some sort of deliberate design by marketing executives to turn us into passive lump who live to gobble up a whatever is beamed into our TVs and computers?

I don't think it is a deliberate plot or movement as much as it is a tendency to go where the money can be found. Hollywood makes its money off its movies and TV shows. It doesn't make a profit encouraging people to entertain themselves with gardening or baking their own bread.

Just sort of typing this out as it comes to my mind.

Feel free to modify

So essentially it's broken down into three sheets:

Budget
Inventory
Consumables
Fairly self explanatory I guess. Most of the 'Budget' sheet is formulas (I multiply my totals by 1.3 for good measure

The 'Inventory' and the 'Consumables' are a little more fancy. Though they're essentially a glorified list. There are columns for weight, lifecycle and monthly cost. Each time you buy/renew a new item, put the date down and repeat in each subsequent column until those dates are full. Now (though I do this part manually) fingers crossed the spreadsheet should do the next part for you - which is calculating the three time differences and averaging them so you have a vague lifecycle. The last column divides this number so you can see how much that is per month.

From there - use it regularly - add things as and when you buy them. I have a red sticker on my bank card to remind me to update the document after I make new purchases. It's a pain at first but you do it less and less as the document gets more complete. Obviously it doesn't take long to work out groceries &amp; consumables and some of the life cycles you can work out yourself (like how often you should buy a new toothbrush etc). Eventually it's really useful for things like clothes or electronics. Not to mention it can also be used as a record for insurance purposes or a clear list to help you de-clutter.",,t5_2r0za,1360510995.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/188so3/so_i_threw_together_a_blank_version_of_the/

My story:  
In my early 20's I was a very anxious and depressed person. Since I was 19 I have always had a good job, but I didn't quite realize the significance of it back then. I also hated cleaning and realized that I was cleaning a lot, dusting and other stuff. Don't get me wrong- I like clean and organized. I just didn't want to put a lot of time into it. I found that the more crap I had, the more I was doing it. The more things I had, the more places things needed to be put and the more things needed to be dusted.

In addition

I think I started to realize that the less stuff I had

I wouldn't say it was a switch that flipped in me, it was a process of detaching from that stuff. I collected movies, books, computer equipment. All of which would be touched once, then never again. I have since sold all movies, books, and rid of all the computer crap I had.  

I can now fit almost everything I own into a large backpack. Though I still have more work to do and am excited to do it. Some things on the list are sell my motorcycle (I still have a car and mountain bike that I will keep)

**12/25 UPDATE:**

so first I should elaborate more on the above, who was my former boss before I was diagnosed with CRPS/RSD. She said that there was nothing she could do and if I wasn't out of there by 5pm they would arrest me for trespassing. I never thought in a million years these words would come out of my mouth:

*""Then they can arrest me. I'd rather be arrested than ruin an $80, I had a [spinal cord stimulator] (http://imgur.com/a/FB5vC#0) implanted that changed my life. I've been able to walk 100% of the time, retiring my scooter (hopefully for good). There are of course times that I need to limit bending down, walking for long periods of time but I'm mostly back.*

So the night that I posted, so I don't really remember what happened in the conversations. The first one was just fucking creepy calling me ""sweetie"" and saying ""nighty night"". The second one we agreed to stop by in the afternoon on Friday to come see it. Friday morning I went to the quad office and my old boss wasn't there but her boss who knew me was there. I explained what happened and she paused, then said ""that's fine, do what you have to do"". love that woman. didn't always see eye to eye but she knows what I've been through in my life so I think she sensed that I was really at the end of my rope. 

So we go to see the place later, and not too bad for NY standards. He says he just needs to confirm with the guys but assures me it will probably be fine. Friend and I head off to Wal-Mart to pick up an airbed and a few other things. I'm getting nervous since it's been 5 hours at this poin so I call him. Said one of the guys wanted to speak to me, and apologized that he hadn't called yet and he would speak to him right now. Get a call from other roommate. Asked if I had any questions, etc. I had forgotten to ask about utilities, and if they were included. Says no, it's $100 EXTRA PER PERSON PER MONTH. I asked if I could call him in a few because I had bad reception. I'm standing in the middle of Wal-Mart trying so hard not to have a public meltdown. 

So friend and I go back to campus apartment and I just start throwing shit out. I then receive this text message.

**A: Hi

**Me: Hey yeah I'd definitely like to work something out if possible. I could do $550 total with utilities.**

**Me: I watch tv on my computer

**A: Do u think you'd be willing to do the dishes and some cleaning? I talked to the guys if u can we'll pay the rest of 
everything**

**Me: Yes that's definitely fair**

**A: Great

**Me: Okay sounds good.**

The cleaning thing really didn't bother me

Procedure:
Take your head of raw red cabbage.  Wash it and get rid of any cut or broken leaves on the outside.  Cut it in half, sprinkle 1-2 Tbsp of salt onto the cabbage.  Mix it all up with your hands, to make sure the salt is evenly distributed.  Cover it if you're afraid of bugs getting to it, and let the whole thing sit for at least two hours.

When you come back, and rinse the cabbage well (unless you want it to be really salty).  Voila!

Keep it in the fridge.

I'm an EMT.  My work life is mostly comprised of alarms, I just finished a 24-hour shift yesterday, am currently pulling an overnight, and have a couple day shifts next week.  I see death weekly.  I frequently leave work mentally and physically drained.

My mother is ill and my family is depressed.

I'm studying for the MCATs in a month in order to get into medical school this year.

I sleep incredibly poorly on [this freaking lumpy thing](http://www.raymourflanigan.com/reno-full-klik-klak-with-storage-264277003.aspx) in my bedroom normally.  I sleep on floors and in ambulance seats

**Speed**

As above, because I've convinced myself I love just doing anything (read: nothing) with ""no alarms and no surprises.""  This reduces down to melting in front of a computer.  So I need to find a happy medium where I can still be productive.

**Stuff**

I lived in single-bedroom apartments for 5 years before finally landing a multiple-roommate situaiton for this past year.  Before I moved out of my last place, sold my bed and coffee table, and got rid of a bookshelf.  I reduced my belongings enough to fit them all, albeit in a cramped fashion, into a single bedroom and rather large closet.  I'm proud of this, but I want to trim it down even more.

I have loads of papers from college that I want to keep, so I've been looking at document scanners.  At ~$300-400, I can't figure out if getting another expensive thing is worth it to get rid of a few boxes' worth of papers.  I have a tall bookshelf that's completely crammed with books that I keep because ""I might read them someday,"" but in reality, I've maybe pulled about a dozen off of it in the past year.

I try to give away clothes yearly

I worked in IT for many years before EMS so I have two plastic, peripherals, and equipment I've garnered over time.  Again, I rarely grab stuff from them, but when I do, it's something very obscure and a pain to get online, which makes me nervous about chucking anything.

**Thoughts**

I've tried to postulate why I am where I am.  I'm sure people reading this might think depression, or if I'm depressed because I'm living this way.  I think it's the latter, so I'd like to fix it.  I'm usually a happy guy.

1312381446.0,j7qvq,Stuff,leevs11,45,7,26,"What would you do if you had to leave tomorrow with nothing but what you could carry? Would you load up a suitcase full of pictures and clothes? Would you stuff as many books as you could possibly manage into a box and lug it on your shoulders? Would you bring the bare essentials of a few toiletries

We seem to collect so much stuff in our lives

We don’t really need all of the things sitting in our closets, and cars. You could lose everything you owned tomorrow and it wouldn’t matter. You would get over it. Sure you’d be sad about a few sentimental items. You’d miss your favorite shirt and pictures of your kids, but you’d go on.

If we don’t need any of this stuff, and attics to store things that we don’t even look at?

Why do people get angry when they lose things? What does it matter?

The only thing that matters in your life is your experiences. What you do today is all that matters. If you enjoy yourself and are happy then you are on the right track. Why would you keep doing it if you hated what you were doing? Why do we sit in cubicles in stuffy offices so that we can make enough money to buy things?

Then we buy things and have nowhere to put them

Well that car costs money, in fact, that you need to work harder to find a better job so that you can afford it more easily.

So now you are already working a job in a cubicle that you don’t like

All the while

All of these things keep weighing on us as time goes on. The debt never quite seems to go away. Yet

Somewhere along the way you maybe get married and have kids. With the extra people and all of that stuff, but it still has a pretty big mortgage payment. The problem is that you had to move farther out into the suburbs to find a bigger house that you could afford, so you might as well buy a new car that gets better gas mileage. Oh and don’t forget the second car or minivan to take care of those kids.

Now you’ve just spent thousands more dollars moving all of your stuff into the new house and on down payments and of course new furniture because you need something nice for the new place. Well now you’re really strapped for money, but at least you can afford to buy them new toys and send them to that expensive after school program.

But it doesn’t end there. Those toys take up space. They’re just more stuff. You keep acquiring more of that stuff. It’ll eventually lead to another house

Everything keeps piling up. Eventually you’re making three times more than what you were when you were making when you started out. If you’re lucky that is. But for some reason

Your kids eventually graduate and leave for college or a job. Then you finally decide that it’s time to downsize your lifestyle. You move into a smaller house and get the smaller car. You sell some of your stuff

All of this keeps going on. It’s an endless cycle of making more money so you can spend more and more. Eventually you retire and things are okay. Maybe you even pay off your mortgage and own your home. All that hard work finally paid off now you want to travel

You finally have all the time in the world to travel, but now you’re in your 70s and are too tired to go anywhere. All the while your kids visit less and less. Your friends are starting to die off. Maybe you even lose your spouse.

Your house is still full of all of the stuff you’ve collected over the years. You have a basement and attic full of boxes of things you don’t even remember. Your kids grumble about who will have to clean it up when you die. You sit in your house all day waiting for one of your kids or grandkids to visit. You make sure your stuff is organized and clean so that anybody who visits will be impressed with your tidy home.

Then you really get sick. This time it’s for real. You lay there in the hospital with a nurse whose name you can’t remember. Your stuff is so far away from you. You don’t even remember 1/10th of it all. Maybe you do remember that you never saw the Great Wall of China or rode the Tube in London.

Maybe you even have some consciousness in the end and realize that you worked so hard your entire life to buy all of that stuff

Then you die. The funeral is nice with lots of flowers. Most of the young kids don’t even know what’s going on. A few weeks later your kids take a few things from your house for sentimental reasons. They need to add to their stockpile of stuff.

Then they sell the rest of it or donate it to good will. They’ll probably just throw half of your stuff away. All of the stuff that you worked so hard to accumulate will be gone. You don’t get to take it with you. And the worst part is that it takes the most precious thing away from you.

Time.

**Short Form** : I have a lot of things I don't use (toys, computers, monitors, clothes, instruments, boxes, assignments
*****
**Long Form** : I have kept things and been a packrat because that is what I observe from family. They all have crates and chests of things we never touch. Grandmothers' old quilts and sweaters. Sentimental concepts from years gone by. Largely it was with introversion
.  
Yeah, ended in grade 8 (age 14 or so) I'm 23 now. I'm graduating college in 4 months, living common law with my girlfriend of 2 years, we've been living together for 18 months and things are, really going well. With counselling and help and new environments from moving for college, I've really changed a lot of who I am. But I still seem to attempt to define myself from old possessions.  
.  
I get hung up about old things, I just had my toys.'. It's an immediate sense of worthlessness and so I feel any veritable worth is still only maintained in my possessions.  
.  
Worse being, try and read all these minimalist blogs or declutter articles and get so inspired, then I fall flat the second I open a box.  
I remember why I have the toys

But like I said, it's just that extra bit they don't have to do. Also, it's for my own independence, I feel like it's using space as storage, I come home and I have no sense of productivity, I feel like I'm back to being a high school graduate with nothing to do and I hate it. I just sit surrounded by old comforts that are now old ghosts and can't even conceive getting rid of it.  
.  
I am constantly afraid that tossing any of it, possibly, but no guarantee, turn to crap.  
.  
I am moving into a 1 bedroom with my girlfriend in the coming months and the sense that I am moving on in life, unemployment leading to homelessness (this shouldn't happen, I've never been late for rent in my life and managed it myself for 4 years, but the fear still sits there, as though I might become the most spontaneously incapable person for paying rent.)  
*****
.  
So, criticisms, suggestions, resources... all of that is great.  
.  
I am getting counselling to help with a lot of things that happened in the last year (Grandmother died, mom has fibro and arthritis and will just keep losing mobility, other sister had a good many pregnancy scares, though did eventually carry to term after having had 3 1st term 'miscarriages' [I think there's an actual term, not sure of it at this time.]).  
.  
But while counselling's been great for helping me clear my mind about it
As I write this
Sorry for the length of the post

**edit 1**: reading [this article (CNN)](http://articles.cnn.com/2009-01-20/living/rs.top.causes.of.clutter_1_clothes-obstacle-attic?_s=PM:LIVING) is helping with a few ideas. I'm still searching around and just trying to figure out how to get past what feels like this last barrier of having all this garbage.

The exact amount isn't set in stone, I'd give up the money in a heartbeat if it meant that things were different


My question is, even if it's only for the summer months. The ultimate dream is to buy my own plot of land and build a small home on it to achieve some degree of self-sufficiency, but I'm happy to rough it while I'm young. Having said that, while freedom is the key thing, running water and electricity would also be lovely.


I know the bureaucracy around how people choose to live in the UK is fairly complicated and restrictive but I've few boxes to tick and am open to pretty much anything.  The most important thing would probably be not getting into a situation where I'd feel the money had been squandered


I should mention that at the moment I have no regular income (I'm just about to graduate from university, which I guess wouldn't be the worst thing to happen to somebody... I would also consider investing in somewhere or something abroad.


Anywho, it would be really helpful to be able to formulate some kind of idea of what's possible. Any advice would be very much appreciated!

Poo/kitchen scraps go into the bucket and then get covered with a handful or two of sawdust or pine shavings.   (Before you ask

Today I built a new proper compost bin out of 4 used pallets and some vinyl twine and I thought I'd share the process with you guys.

([complete album for those without RES](http://imgur.com/a/rFC0p#vAZ6n))

Stage 2: Prepare the initial Ingredients  
[Bucket of poo / used Mouse cage bedding](http://i.imgur.com/xFeJK.jpg)  
[Poured in the mouse bedding](http://i.imgur.com/1IJXa.jpg)  
[Someone gave me an old rotten bale of hay](http://i.imgur.com/pwR7o.jpg)   
[Couple pitch fork loads into the bin](http://i.imgur.com/FXT4i.jpg)   
[In goes the poo bucket](http://i.imgur.com/dPwKF.jpg)  
The initial ""whiff"" of air here was a bit pungent.   I looked and could not identify any actual poop.   Mostly I just see wet shavings and some paper products I tossed in there recently.      
[Spent 20 minutes weeding my garden/yard and threw that in as a cover material](http://i.imgur.com/YBswa.jpg)     

I'll be adding a couple tubs worth of mice bedding later today and probably some more weeds.  
 
This bin will be on a 3 year cycle.  3 years must pass after adding the last bucket containing human waste.  I'll continue to add yard waste until it's full and as it shrinks.   According to my book the final product will be ~20% of the original mass/volume.   Should take me about a year or two to fill it up.   That bucket contained about 2 months worth of poo and bin is only filled up about 10-15%.  (figure 2-3% once it's composted)  It looks about half full but those weeds/straw will shrink and compact very quickly.   

My timeline/recipes are based off of the [Humanure Handbook](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;cp=9&amp;gs_id=12&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=humanure+handbook&amp;qe=aHVtYW51cmUg&amp;qesig=tRyxY7xElmdFbepqAGhWJw&amp;pkc=AFgZ2tnMrSvStpPSAuOO3iTZYuKWNCRLcXP-W_7Dar0PsLTTrWspXg1Qa0uMvcLkPIrX0AsKamYYBfX6XAd8R8GK37R7BpxoTg&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=psy&amp;safe=off&amp;site=&amp;source=hp&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=humanure+&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g5&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=&amp;gs_upl=&amp;bav=on.2

minded

Our major problem is that our garage is full of chairs, tools a newish but crap plasma TV and other ""useful stuff"" from our storage locker we gave up to save money. We park our cars on the street instead. We don't throw anything away because of stupid reasons like ""we should have a garage sale"" or ""we should hire a truck and take this to the markets"".  This doesn't happen because we are too time poor to organise this. Also because our neighbourhood is fairly nice and we suspect no-one would buy our ""junk"" except maybe students/artists or thrifty people from low socioeconomic backgrounds hence we would need to advertise heaps.

Our in house storage under the stairs is full of carefully packed kids clothes

We have heaps of kids books toys and games around too.   Many of the kids favourite toys have been rescued from markets and cleaned up. Lego is still the most favourite. 

Now it's come to a head as we are redecorating and have splurged on some furniture and have to get rid of some trashed chairs and a bookcase. i have to either do a ""bulk collection"" pickup by the council or hire a dumpster. It's tempting to just throw heaps of in our mind at least ""serviceable useful stuff"" out that we would have just loved for our first student flat etc.

The house is a three bedroom, so those rooms will be in use. Here are the problems:

- One of my roommates likes his bedroom to be cool when he sleeps. Keeping the second floor even remotely cool requires that I set the thermostat on the first floor to 68
- Both the A/C unit and furnace are about 20 years old
-There is a massive A/C leak in the basement. It looks like the previous owner cut a hole in the duct and just attached an air vent to the foamboard ceiling under it
- I can tell that the ground floor is insulated

My question is: what ways would you recommend to reduce energy consumption? Here are my ideas:

- Seal off the leaking section of the A/C to reduce waste. Also check the rest of the A/C system for leaks.
- Replace the old A/C unit with a newer high-efficiency unit
- Ask the roommate if he would be willing to switch to the downstairs bedroom where I'm sleeping. The square footage in his room is actually higher, and his room is still warmer than he would like. If he was downstairs, he could have the perfect temperature.
- Have an ""energy auditor"" do a pressure test to find the sources of air leaks in the house so that I can seal them
- Get a particular brand of blackout shades (not curtains) which creates a seal along the entire window
- Find out if the second floor is actually insulated and insulate it if not
- Purchase a Nest thermostat to track energy usage and program it to use as little energy as possible. Right now I have a pathetic non-programmable thermostat which only allows for a minimum and maximum temperature setting.

We have bigger houses
More conveniences
We have more degrees
More knowledge
More experts
More medicines

We have multiplied our possessions
We talk too much
We have learnt how to make a living
We have added years to life
We've been all the way to the moon and back
But have trouble crossing the street to meet the new neighbour.

We have conquered outer space
We've cleaned up the air
We've split the atom
We've higher incomes
We've become long on quantity but short on quality.

These are the times of tall men
Steep profits
These are the times of world peace
More leisure

These are the days of two incomes
Of fancier houses

Her claim is that it's impossible to live simply and minimally with kids.  I beg to differ.  We have a three-year old.  He has enough clothes to go 3 days.  We buy used clothing or get hand-me-downs.  Every few months I go through his toys and clothes and donate those that aren't used to the local orphanage.

I don't buy plastic or ""specific"" toys.  His toys are all wood or cloth and are ""open-ended"" so he can play with them for years.  Prime example

Just wondering if you have any other ideas I can pass on to my friend (and prove my point lol).

Edit:  Just to be clear. I'm not saying my way is best. It works for my family

And yes, my main point here is that you CAN live simply with a child. Not that it's the right way or the only way, simply that it can be done. And my friend has put a couple of suggestions (toy rotation, limiting the number of shoes) of mine into effect. Just as I've taken several of hers about living greener (cloth coffee filters FTW).

Drove from Jersey all the way down to North Carolina with two friends and my kid in an SUV.  I made the joke at some point in the trip that we couldn't crash because everything I cared about in life was in that car.  

This week I came home from vacation and decided that I am selling my house and getting rid of all the crap.  I have never been attached to 'things'

I may be making a deal with the homeowner this weekend that I could be living in that same beach house in exchange for painting the exterior and basically house sitting over the winter off season. So, but there is that nagging feeling that I am just being insane.

As a shampoo:
Rub in
Leave in for a while
Rinse out with warm water and apple cider vinegar

As a facial wash:
Rub in
Leave in for a while
Use a cloth dipped in warm water until it cools a few times
Use ACV with warm water as a facial toners

As a body wash:
Rub in
Leave in for a while
Use a cloth dipped in warm water and ACV to rinse off

What are people's thoughts on this? Has anyone tried it? Using a few simple ingredients appeals to me and I feel it would save time as well as help my dry skin a great deal. I just feel like I'm missing something as the idea is maybe too simple perhaps?

Update: So as a test I tried Plain Ol' Olive Oil (Colovita 100% Organic Cold Production) and Apple Cider Vinegar (Not Bragg's but it looked liked it had a bit of mother of vinegar) Also coconut oil based body spray.

Method: Rubbed Olive Oil in from Hair to Toe. Wash Cloth dipped in roughly 1/2 cup ACV to 3 cups warm water (used it twice

For the face: Success! My skin feels lovely and refreshed.

For the body: OK. Same refreshing feeling

For the hair: Applied Olive Oil to start. Then left in while I did the whole body and face. I just poured it on top and rinsed it out. I don't think I got it all out though and it feels slightly oily to touch. I should probably have taken care and rubbed the hair properly

Conclusions: Not a bad first trial. If the Castor Oil makes it thicker I think that's a good thing so I'm massaging rather than smearing. I might try less ACV (just to be more frugal) as I feel maybe the warm water takes care of removing the oil (must make sure not to clog the drains though!). A lot more time consuming than first imagined

Next steps - Castor Oil + Olive Oil / Witchazel + ACV
Maybe even real coconut oil with essential oils post-shower,False,,t5_2r0za,1347931747.0,,,t3_z0oa6

I first started simplifying by necessity. I had to move three times in four months. Every time I moved

For me, and I want to leave a lighter footprint.  I’ve learned a lot along the way, and I’m still working on it.

**Eradication**
The first step for me was eradication. I was at a weird place in my life, old computers, jewelry). It’s okay to sell stuff, but don’t waste time bargaining with greedy bastards. It’s not healthy. It won’t teach you any good lessons. I tried selling an old imac on Craigslist, but the potential buyer was an asshole. I gave it away to a family without a computer instead.

It can feel scary to give away expensive stuff. It’s also totally exhilarating. You’ll fee lighter once it’s gone.

**Organization**
After getting rid of excess stuff, and clothes thrown all over my floor. Thus began the organization phase.

For me, filing folders, and shelves. You still need a place to put your important papers and clothes.

**Beautification**
After eradicating and organization, getting a few houseplants, putting fresh (wild)flowers around the house, and acquiring a few small rugs. My space no longer looks depressing. It looks alive and “lived in.”

**Patience**
For me

Right now

I walked around my house today and took some photos of little things that have worked for me. If anyone is interested

The rationale for me: As I prepare to move across town to a rented room in May, I am already pretty minimal -- but am thinking of going even leaner because I plan to move to a farflung place (possibly Alaska) next year, and obviously I wouldn't be taking much of anything. So I thought maybe I'd rid myself of it sooner rather than later and replace it with...*something.*

Currently: I sleep on a basic full-sized foam mattress, I find that I never use more than half of the bed's width. A twin is all I need.

Options/Ideas/Questions:

* Is there some kind of adult sleeping mat?

* I don't know much about camping gear

* Could I put a sleeping bag on top of a big yoga mat or some kind of foam pad?

* Could I

* I thought about air mattresses

* Hammocks seem...dangerous

* Do Japanese people sleep on those tatami mats, Japan, Korea, India...or some other non-Western country.

* Other thoughts? Has anyone done this for an extended period?

The idea is this. Australia is a country with out of control real-estate prices. Buying a house and land package in the greater metropolitan regions usually requires two professional incomes to support a 25-year mortgage. Australia is also obsessed with large spaces; rather than build up

My idea is this: A co-op owned house in a nice suburb, and families who democratically set house procedure and use shared space. Architecturally I invision a large industrial kitchen producing low-cost eco-friendly food on a lower floor, a large shared space with areas for reading, entertainment, and eating on the second floor, and individual spaces on a third floor.

From a minimalism perspective, one large kitchen, and one internet plan. With the right individuals, the idea also supports small-scale agriculture like vegetable gardens and shared use of vehicles.

Part of the reasoning which permits quitting the confucian rat-race early is the extremely low cost of living in that area

An example of the quandary I feel on the horizon is thus: I enjoy playing guitar

What about books? I have sold or given away most of my books and kept a few I couldn't find an easy replacement for. I mostly read on my kindle-  but owning a kindle demands internet access

What about music? I've got a real passion for listening to Jazz

In fact there were so many talks that we wanted to attend we had to be really picky about what we wanted to see. I personally thought they would have been better off reducing the number of talks offered at a time and simply add an extra day to the conference. A lot of the speakers I saw could have easily been extended out for an extra hour and that way the information wouldn't have been so rushed.

I don't feel the facility was up to the task of supporting that many people in attendance. The rooms were simply too small, and the lack of on-site or nearby lodging for people attending both days.

I've always claimed to have a desire to live a minimal lifestyle but my actions haven't backed up that claim as I own a lot of stuff for a 29 year old. I've been fascinated by the Tumbleweed Tiny Houses for a couple years now but have been scared to make a jump because of my own lack of knowledge (and lack of carpentry ability). Regardless, a job that makes me money but I don't love and a current location that lacks good friends or family.

The trouble is that I am hesitant to take any step forward because I just can't grasp what options I may have. Here is what I desire:

* I want to live with less items in my life
* I want to live with mobility (easy to go where I want)
* I don't want to live off-the-grid (I want to be within a community of people ideally)
* I want a place where my two cats could live with me
* I want to live frugally (or

I'd say those are the extent of the things I'm looking for. Tiny Houses seem so wonderful but they seem to lack mobility (as well as my lack of building expertise). Basically

TL;DR - Options wide open; want to live with less but be mobile and around people while being frugal as well",,t5_2r0za,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/1cd1lr/looking_to_learn_about_my_options_for_a_simple/
1360008670.0,17vuz7,College kid looking to build a sustainable home. Need reddit's help for an estimate! (X-Post from /r/askreddit),thillis,8,0,5,"Alright

To start off, but am not too keen on living in an apartment or house with lots of people. So, I thought about how much it would cost to buy/rent a plot of land, buy a shipping container, furnish the inside, and wire it up so that it was sustainable by itself. Now, I have no past experience to start this dream and that's why I thought reddit might be able to help!

Some things that I need to know:

* Price of renting/buying a plot of land
* Price of buying a shipping container and getting it delivered to said plot of land
* How to properly insulate the container so that it can be warm in the winter
* Cost/installation of electricity
* Cost/installation of solar panels(?) or some sort of self sustaining energy source
* and finally

If reddit can help me out on this task
