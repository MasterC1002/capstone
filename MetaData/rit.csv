You may think that you're going to leave this place after graduation and never look back, or b) greatly underestimate how much of an impact RIT is leaving on your life. I know I underestimated it. I complained a lot while I was here. I complained about the things I didn't like about RIT, and I was cynical. Many of you are the same. And I think that's ok, but don't forget to see the good things about this place.

And wow this place never stops changing... new buildings (and fountains) everywhere. But I guess it was silly to expect to come back to the school exactly as I had left it.After all, the field house, the closing of the old pool, the kodak quad and new base for the tiger statue, and my newly-formed college move into a new building.

----

My girlfriend lived in one of his houses

He came into my friend's house in the middle of the night and stabbed one of their mattresses with a screwdriver and left it sticking out of the mattress (roommate was gone for the night). He stole some things, and he'll send really aggressive texts calling you ""commie liberal entitled rich kids."" His houses are very run down, which is fine for many college students, but he either doesn't keep track of what's damaged or just tries to blame it all on each new group of students. 

He had converted the garage of my girlfriend's house into a bedroom without notifying the town or getting a permit

Her roommates also bailed on the lease because he was a bastard, but the level of harassment was extremely intense. 

Another friend of mine wanted to move into one of his houses and paid a security deposit. He went to a party there and saw mold

He said ""I'm not moving in. I need a copy of the lease I signed and my security deposit back."" This was followed was more swearing and threatening court. Last I heard he was trying to figure out the guy's address so he could take him to small claims.

You *will not* get your security deposit back. You will be harassed

I mutter obscenities to myself and proceed to backtrack along the bike path, I decide to give public safety a call before tracing back along the bike path one more time. To my amazement

On a similar note, and I feel even better I have it at my back. Maybe I'm inexperienced as far as the community feel here, but in my opinion, all of you rock.

I'm kind of embarrassed that people who mainly listed the bad things at RIT are still here. Seriously people? If there's something you can complain about in private



Now sure



If you complain about the weather, NY was going to right in the middle of a snow band, right next to a huge fucking lake. Everybody is going to complain about getting snow in April, everybody is going to complain about how cold the winds are, etc... You came into this school knowing that eventually it'd be the complete opposite of Hell, weather-wise.



Oh, you didn't submit your deposit, etc... All these things are going to be your fault if you or your parents didn't keep on top of it. You might have a bad roommate, or live on a really loud floor. Again, if you don't speak up, you're going to be living on the floor and with that crappy roommate for the remainder of the academic year. At least confront your roommate first if you have a problem with them, whether it's hygiene related or they're just not adhering to the ""rules"" form you both established during the week of orientation.



Ah, especially if it's a class only offered once a year. Make at least 2 or 3 schedules in case you can't manage to get all the classes from the first one. If the class is essential to your major there are going to be at least two sections that you can find a spot in. If they're not essential to your major, tough luck.



People here will say that everybody is super nice, i.e. ""future baristas"", ""neck-beards"" etc... Nobody is really better than anybody else here, but people will think that they are.



Another issue some people have is parking. If you're a freshmen and you live on campus and are complaining about parking, stop being lazy. If you want to have less of a walk pay the $40/q to park in one of the reserved spaces. One thing I've noticed about commuters is that they aren't aware you can park in ANY spot (just not handicap) after 5pm. Parking is NOT enforced after 5pm. Shit park in an admin spot if it's available. Oh that spot in front of Crossroads is available and you plan on staying for 3 hours, fuck it, park there. If you enjoy the walk from the bottom of H/G lot to GCCIS at 6pm in the dead of winter, then so be it, but I'm gonna park in one of those admin spaces because I can. If you get a ticket during the day, well again, oh well, got another and decided to use my freebie on that one because it was $30 vs $18. The only days you should complain about parking is on career fair days or if there's an open house (like today 4/5/13).



If you're here just because you got an amazing financial aid package, but you shouldn't be restricted to staying here if you hate the place. I would much rather see somebody who hates the school move onto a better school, then see them continue finding all the flaws this university may or may not. I know a lot of you are going to be scared of that ""massive debt"" after graduating, but you got six months to find a job and get off your ass before you're gonna have to start repaying those loans. Everybody is going to be in debt, one way or another. But please, don't just come to this school because you are paying little to none out of pocket. This university has one of the best cooperative education programs in existence, you'd have to be the most unlucky person to not find a job after graduating from this college



Come to this school because it's what you want, it's where you'll meet the professor who made you feel like a star student, it's where you just might find the love of your life, it's where you will find your passion, it's where you will find out who you really are, good or bad.

Destler: In 6 months time, laws/contracts, or where no reasonable alternatives exist: like at places off campus.

Destler Via Email:
&gt;Dear RIT Students
In a time when we are increasingly mindful of the rising cost of education it is difficult to justify spending University funds on bottled water
This policy will be phased in over the next six months to enable departments to plan for and adjust to this change.  Dining services will continue to sell bottled water in vending machines and retail locations throughout the duration of our current vending contract, no new contracts for bottled water will be entered into.
Water is a healthy beverage choice and a basic human right, future construction and renovation projects will include the installation of hydration stations for easy refilling of reusable water bottles.  NTID has demonstrated leadership in this area and has already installed stations in two of its buildings.  
Exceptions have been written into the policy
RIT has grown to become one of the nation’s largest private universities in the country
Sincerely yours
Dr. Bill Destler
Destler@ReplaceItThrice.edu

[Full Policy](http://www.rit.edu/sustainability/policies):
&gt;Bottled water has economic, is of high quality and is at least 2000% less expensive than bottled water. Therefore, this policy has been developed to minimize the non-essential use of bottled water. Find out more about bottled water [here](http://www.rit.edu/sustainability/sites/rit.edu.sustainability/files/sites/rit.edu.sustainability/files/BottledwaterFactSheetFinal.pdf).
&gt;
&gt;**Policy**
&gt;
University funds may not be used to purchase **single serving bottles of water**. 
&gt;
&gt;In new construction and renovation projects bottle-less water dispensers will be installed; and the university will explore the feasibility of retrofitting existing buildings with such dispensers.
&gt;
&gt;**Procedures**
&gt;
&gt;This policy applies to all departments, and any other campus groups that use university funds for catered events or beverage purchases; and will be phased in over six months to provide adequate time to make adjustments.

&gt;**Exceptions**
&gt;
&gt;Dining Services will continue to sell bottled water for the time being to individuals in vending machines, not provide bottled water for other campus events.  Water is available at fountain locations in dining centers for no cost. After the current vending contract expires, no new contracts for bottled water will be entered into.

&gt;For all other catered operations

&gt;Other exceptions may be made to this policy

It's spring! Well, the bikes have come out in force. It's great to see so many people outside instead of cooped up, but a lot of new bikers seem to be unfamiliar with a bunch of unwritten rules at RIT. After some incredibly close calls, I find it necessary to make a PSA, in an effort to teach people about courtesy on a bike, making everyone happier. 

1. If you are using the quarter mile to ride

1. When riding on the bike path, etc., stay on the right. It's happened far too many times that someone's been riding all the way on the left in a crowded area, meaning that people who are actually on the right side have nowhere to go. 

1. Unless you're on the bike path

1. When using bike racks, one. 

1. Don't lock other people's bikes. It has happened multiple times where I go to my bike

1. Say ""Excuse me"" when trying to get through a mass of people. It makes it easier. If they have headphones or are deaf, and they'll let you through. 

Some of these are common sense, if people actually used some courtesy on a bike (and this goes both ways, pedestrians!), we could all be a bit happier and get to our classes without having a sour run-in with someone else.",,False,self,False,t3_r5zow

* 1.The higher the floor the more silence is expected.
* 2. Don't take phone calls on floors 3 &amp; 4. (See above) 
* 3.Although our library is excellent in the fact that you can eat anywhere in it.. save your crinkly chips and other crunching/ munching for the 1st &amp; 2nd floors of the building. (Once again see point 1.) 
* 4. Listening to your music while doing work is a great thing. But once again
* 5. Don't share a work space with someone if you are a leg jiggler, or other tick prone person. That is distracting. Ain't nobody got time for that.
* 6. Group meetups/best friend meet ups/ boyfriend-girlfriend make outs - save this for the first and second floor. ( see point 1.)
* 7. If you don't require an outlet
* 8. Flush the toilets. (Pretty self explanatory.)

Here

1. Take a liberal arts course. They're full of girls (and other people to socialize with outside your major) and you need a minor or concentration to graduate anyway.

2. Walk down the quarter mile. Find a girl walking the same way

3. Wait in line at any of the campus coffee places. You're waiting

4. Join a club. Clubs have girls with similar interests who meet in one spot on a weekly/monthly basis. Go there. Participate.

5. Change your routine or you'll only be hanging around the same people. (thanks chimera8990!)

6. Go to parties

7. Make friends with girls

1350335183.0,11j5dm,Why ROAR Day is so wrong,thayd,79,33,140,"For those of you who may not know, for the following reasons:

**Aren't we already paying for that?** *The answer; yes.* According to the [Admissions Page] (http://www.rit.edu/fa/sfs/billing/tuitionandfees/1213/undergraduate/fulltime.html), $240 in Student Activity Fees, $234 in Health Facilities Fees, and an average $7,607 in Room &amp; Board. And after that whopping $40,865, they have the nerve to ask us current students for extra money to support something on campus? It's shameful and inexcusable.

**What do we get?** *The answer; less than we should.* We are lured in with free swag, and instead direct all the money you're spending on them to the school and student activities instead? President Destler recently wrote an [excellent article] (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-destler/college-competition-_b_1867165.html) on the rising cost of education, and how it is a problem that unnecessary measures are being taken to impress students at their own expense.  I think Bill needs to practice what he preaches.

**Does this school even deserve our money?** *The answer; no.* While I understand that these are touchy issues, and the Plus/Minus Grading debate. In the case of the former, the change was rammed down our throats despite an overwhelming student majority being in opposition. The New SIS was only announced to us very late in the process, and it as put in place with minimal student input. And despite the outpouring of negative feedback, the administration is showing all indications of staying the course. And though the +/- Grading topic has been tabled until after the Semester Conversion is complete, while it was still an active topic the debate once again seemed to be drifting against the student majority of opposition. Now take a moment and try to remember if your academic departments have taken the same approach. Speaking for myself, my major recently had a pretty significant change to our course-list (still under the Quarter system) and this was suddenly announced to us one day with no student input beforehand. Anyone experience something similar? Now ask yourself...does it seem right that our administration routinely ignores our opinions

TL;DR: Our administration already charges us a boatload of money

To paraphrase the Joker

Is there any interest in working together to create an open source alternative to RIT's new geneSIS?

I know what you're thinking -- this sounds familiar! And it does. Many people have tried. John Resig (Schedule Maker 1.0), to name a few. But the problem with all of them is that they're one(ish) person projects, and they die as soon as the student graduates. That's why I want to start over, and make it completely open source. Anyone can contribute; anyone can keep it going.

PeopleSoft is necessary. No student run project could ever hope to achieve the level of features, the interface students use is horrible. No website should require ""training sessions"" and a manual that gives War and Peace a run for its money.

Together, marketers, sysadmins and more. Together, we can make an awesome system that fits our so called ""University of One"" like a glove. And it'll be open source! Imagine universities across the country running software made by RIT.

I wouldn't want to stop there. If we can get a good open source community going at RIT

1. The semester conversion wasn't made entirely to be like other schools. The biggest factor in the conversion was how it correlates with the co-op program we're so lucky to have. Companies find it much easier to accommodate an intern for a semesters length, rather than having a student on the quarter system duck out 5 weeks earlier.
2. Destler also stated that the amount of transfers peaks at the beginning of week 10. The semester conversion will, by plan, semesters were to be 14 weeks long, but Destler actively fought the faculty against this decision as he wanted to ensure those who were on the quarter system in the past would be able to be comfortable with an equal course load throughout semesters. Granted, Destler basically ""vetoed"" the situation and in turn had semesters become 15 weeks long.
3. Parking is a privilege at RIT. You can complain about having to pay $100 a year to park, and even buying a reserved single lot pass is still not a terrible expense if you tend to like parking closer.

And before you ask

I love that jacket, keys, phone, and such.

**WALLET**: A black standard trifold. Has a little zipper pocket on the back for coins. Contains my license, library card, Subway card, etc. and about $13. (I am clearly the richest.) Plus some receipts I need to be reimbursed for my Imagine RIT project. 

**KEYS**: A silver carabiner that used to be purple before all the paint scratched off with keys to my apartment, parents' house, some CSH stuff, as well as my [iButton](http://www.estexpert.com/image/mypic_customize/i_button.jpg)

**PHONE**: A Droid Incredible 2 with a [custom-painted Tardis case](http://alliekins.imgur.com/tardisphone) that is significantly more beat up now- much of the paint has chipped, stuff I can never get back.

**OTHER**: 1 pair of original Zune earbuds and a USB wireless dongle.

Please, or might have grabbed it accidentally in your laundry pile, let me know. Alternately, if you stole my jacket, I'll won't be mad if you just return some or all of my things. Message me, or turn it in to Campus Safety. I'll even buy you a garbage plate or something.

1. I've seen a few other threads here about stolen bikes lately
1. I could have cut every single bike loose off the rack his bike had been locked to with a pair of bolt cutters in less than a half hour

Seriously


So

* Lesson number one. **Buy a u-lock! Do not use a cable lock.**

Cable locks keep honest people from running away with your bike. I'm not joking. If you don't believe me

* Lesson number two. **Lock your bike up correctly!**

I took these at random unnamed racks located on the campus after campus safety showed up to take a report from the student that had his bike stolen. I'm not trying to be a dick

* Lesson number three. **How to properly lock a bike!**

For starters, [replace them with bolts](http://i.imgur.com/vuujh.jpg).

If you have a bike, otherwise it's $10.

Another thing to know is that there's a bicycle co-op downtown called R Community Bikes. If you show up on one of the days their open to the public

tl;dr: Don't use a cable lock. Buy a u-lock. Don't lock your bike up like an idiot.

If any students that know of any other specific campus resources

&gt;Can anyone explain to me how a hockey program as classy as Rochester Institute of Technology’s Tigers could give rise to a fan base so completely devoid not only of class, the last line of which is, “And the home of the brave,” the cretinous crowd of RIT supporters shouts over the vocalist, “And the home of the Tigers!”

&gt;When the “Star-Spangled Banner” is being sung, not acceptable adult behavior and not funny. It is a smear on RIT’s fine hockey program and wrong on every level.

Please don't show up to the RIT job fair in a cowboy hat, sleeping cloths, or any other forms of clothing you would be embarrassed going to work in. I see students come every year looking like they just woke up and decided to walk down to the field house in there nighties. 

When you go to potential employers to ask questions about the company they represent

Also it general doesn't reflect the RIT community well to do that. So please

1315230423.0,k5bnt,/r/rit Rules and Posting Guidelines ,xb4r7x,43,4,14,"Good morning everyone!

A new school year has started

I'm going to lay out a few rules

* ***NO POSTING SOMEONE'S PERSONAL INFORMATION*** This means *any* personal information. First name, address, [facebook link](http://facebook.com/profile.php?=73322363), I don't care what it is... if it can be used to tie a reddit account back to a real person it will be removed. (That said, if someone's reddit account name is JoeSchmoe123 and you say ""Hey Joe!"" -- I'll let that slide.) Seriously though... personal info is a no no. ***[EDIT]: [Just in case people don't know, this isn't our rule. The admins can and will ban people for this.](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/07/on-reddiquette.html)***

* ""Hey /r/rit I want to do [insert illegal activity here] and get away with it, again, will be removed. Ask your neighbor if they know who makes quality fake IDs -- not /r/rit. 

* ***THE FIRST RULE OF FIGHT CLUB IS THAT YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUB*** -- If you don't know what I'm talking about

* Play nice. If you disagree with someone there's no reason to turn it into a heated debate. [Please refer to this flowchart](http://www.notquitewrong.com/rosscottinc/2011/08/03/so-youre-mad-about-something-on-the-internet/)

* If you haven't read the [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) before


*If you're unsure about whether or not your post is acceptable it probably isn't... but PM either myself or titsntats and we can let you know if it's worth your time to make the post or not.*

(Or even better...since Google Docs is a bit limited when you're doing more formatty stuff...Dropbox /[innocently drops referral code](http://db.tt/D9wzaFcH)/)

* But for when even the cloudiest of computing won't do and I'm forced to see you in-person to get this done

* I wish they would teach people that the library tables with the [neon green tape at the end](http://i.imgur.com/8xgR8.jpg) and a the [green arrow outlet sign](http://i.imgur.com/zXwKo.jpg) have power strips UNDERNEATH THE TABLE ITSELF. So **don't** unplug the whole table for your one laptop when there's like 12 other people sitting there. Use the damn power strip.

* Group meetings should not be held on the ""quiet"" floors of the library. Stop being a douche. Some of us have problems with concentration and actually need the deathly silence (as in actual peace and quiet, I would be studying at home.

* I also wish they would either simplify the bus schedules or show people how to use them. For example

* Embrace your RIT e-mail address or at least set up forwarding. If I am e-mailing you instead of texting you

With less than a month until the new semester

- Comment scores will be hidden for 3 hours after posting to reduce ""initial bandwagon/snowball voting""- when a people downvote a comment that has already gotten a few downvotes or vice-versa.

- New flair options are available! You can add flair by clicking on the (edit) button under ""Show my flair on the subreddit"" on the sidebar. You can have both text and image flair.

- Some graphical changes to the sub (picture on the sidebar

- For all of you analytic types

---------------

Our biggest change coming up is the addition of three new weekly threads that we will be posting for the duration of the school year

On Monday there will be a Weekly Event Thread, or even use this thread to get some people to meet-up and try something new! Ever been to the [Indoor Trampoline Park](http://www.skyzone.com/Buffalo) in Buffalo (or the one that's coming to Rochester! thanks, /u/ScumbagRIT)? How about the exotic and tropical plants over at the [Lamberton Conservatory](http://rocwiki.org/Lamberton_Conservatory) at Highland Park?  


There will be a Weekly General Discussion Thread every Wednesday, or discuss your favorite music, game or TV show (just be sure to use the spoiler tag- *\[This is a spoiler sentence.](/spoiler)* ).

There will also be a weekly ""Show Off"" thread on Fridays, work, or even just something you're proud of from a hobby in your spare time! Post a story or share your artwork, videos, songs, and more!

1318808015.0,leijm,That last question at Michael J. Fox's keynote was hijacked,pixelSHREDDER,45,7,36,"If anyone else found that last ""question"" a little random

For those who weren't there, and when they announced the next question would be the last question, my friend was next in line and it was her line's turn. 

Now my friend happens to be a recent grad who loves MJF so much she came back to RIT specifically to hear him speak, she was thrilled. But before she could start speaking, the woman in the other line cut her off- and what she said was mind-bogglingly stupid. I'm paraphrasing, but it went something like this: 

""This isn't really a question, they have a line item that says how profitable their Parkinson's patients are?"" MJF just looks at her like, ""Are you kidding?"" for like 5 seconds before finally giving her a broad answer about his foundation's work.

I felt so bad for my friend, who had to come up with a response to that woman's stupidity. I also can't get my head around what the hell that woman was thinking. Did she think she was being clever, like she was exposing some great corruption in the health care system? She clearly had no clue whatsoever how hospitals operate, and didn't bother to do any sort of research before bringing her all-important discovery to Mr. Fox's attention, at the expense of my friend's time on the mic she actually waited for.

1322504145.0,ms8cd,A few things...,titsntats,51,15,36,"A few things have started coming up again that have been discussed many times before but people seem to not be able to follow simple rules. It’s frustrating for me to have to moderate things like saying someone’s name but guess what? It’s a rule of Reddit, **do not post their name or any other personal information**.  It kills me that I can go on just about any thread knowing that there will be a violation which is really unacceptable. Also

Another thing I want to talk to everyone about is how we’re treating one another on here. I’m publically apologizing for how immature I acted on the notetakers thread (I wasn’t mod status when I posted on it but it should be said regardless). Back on topic, if you can’t say something without calling someone a “bitch”, telling someone they’re “forever alone”, or claiming that you “have to be a dick”; you shouldn’t say it because you look like an asshat. I feel like I have to talk about this because I’ve received a few messages from distraught users, one went so far as to delete their account and apparently will never use Reddit again because of how they were treated by another user.  Whether or not they were overreacting to the situation, I do not want *anyone* to ever feel unsafe or unwelcomed on here. If there is ever a situation where you feel something is up on here, please contact xb4r7x or I. This is an amazing community and I think that gets taken for granted a bit too often.  

And lastly, hence it is sore subject. The short version of events was first time I brought it up I was torn to shreds, second time never went anywhere, and third time we got some good feedback but I wasn’t mod yet and the people “running” the show were not doing much of anything. Because of all that, my rule is if shirts were ever brought up again, when I felt like I could handle doing it all myself with a graphic designer/whoever can photoshop, I’d look into it. I already have to deal with the hell of group projects in class,,False,t3_ms8cd

1329443443.0,pt82l,"For the majority who missed it: Destler's latest statements on hockey, UC, Riverknoll, tuition",FifthFleetOut,3, Arun

**Hockey Broadcasting**

  *Destler:* I was just going to ask WITR... you don't [broadcast] for the women

 *Arun:* It's certainly not a gender discrimination thing at all. We'd love to work through the channels to be able to at some point host the women's Division I hockey games. For now

 *Destler:* Well I'd like to see the audience expanded

**UC Card Access**

 *Arun:* Housing has recently installed card access swipers to UC. What is the reasoning behind this and will the rest of the on campus apartments have swipers installed?

 *Destler:* We are trying to be consistent with the type of swipe access we use in the dormitories already, especially at places like the Commons... if you can't get through the first line of defense how can you even knock on the door? We're going to have to look at that issue and see to what extent we can address that issue. It's all motivated by our attempt to provide the best and most safe and secure environment for our students... and I wouldn't be surprised to see this move on to the other housing units, especially apartment units, but that doesn't mean that we can't learn from this experience and provide a solution that is satisfactory for all involved.

 *Arun:* How will that transfer over

 *Destler:* It would be easier there

 *Arun:* Would we then do away with the keys?

 *Destler:* We could. It really depends on if the economics make any sense. For example

**Riverknoll**

 *Arun:* Speaking of dozing

 *Destler:* Riverknoll is interesting. We, it's clear that the next step is likely to happen some time next Fall.

**Tuition**

 *Arun:* I want to skip to one of our more serious questions. ""Rising tuition costs have become a major worry for U.S. society. What measures are being taken to minimize tuition increases at RIT?""

 *Destler:* It's a very important question and we're trying to move aggressively to try to get some kind of cross containment mechanism in place. You don't want to lower the quality of your program, not spend all the money you do currently on providing those offerings? For example, there's some low hanging fruit in various areas. We're about to install about 20,000 LEDs to replace long tube fluorescents in areas where those fluorescents are on all the time, such as in this room. Those consume about 40% less energy, so over the long haul that's a real money saver for the campus. So we'll continue to look for those kinds of options. We'll look for opportunities to consolidate units -- maybe use fewer administrators to administrate certain functions of the university. You don't want to cut down on the faculty, we're not talking about downsizing the institution. We are talking about trying to be more efficient in the way we operate. This year I set a goal, but it's not enough. We need to find ways to lessen the burden,self,flair
