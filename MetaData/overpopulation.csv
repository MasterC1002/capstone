Been called names? Why do people mostly seem to just freak out at the merest suggestion that population control is a good idea? At different times I've mentioned it in conversation and was called evil, a supporter of eugenics and genocide

But anyway, evil or some sort of hater. Of course I already know there are many programs all over the world that educate people on the advantages of having fewer or no children and dispense free birth control to people who otherwise wouldn't have access to it, but that needs to be stepped up in a big way if it's going to be effective. I just can not get my head around the reason why so many people think any effort to to slow down our population growth means doing horrifying, evil things like forced abortions, infanticide or forced sterilization. Probably the only time I can calm people down is if they say something like, ""Well how many kids do *YOU* have? Maybe *YOU* should be sterilized if you're going to tell everyone else to do it!"" They always get quiet and mumble, ""Oh..."" when I tell them I don't have any kids and I had my tubes tied 10 years ago.

Now

So can anyone help me out with some links (focused at United States data preferable)

Thank you in advance for your assistance.


**Edit** this is what I have written so far:

Hmm, land to collect fuel, land to hold their waist, land to grow their wood... etc.  Everything you touch has to have come from somewhere, and that all takes up a LOT of space.  

As for the land currently NOT being used by humans, that's a whole new discussion about keystone species and ecosystem balance.... I'll just let you know, they were what kept Houston's mosquito population in check, now the mosquitoes are running wild with not a lot to stop them (those trucks with the spray don't do squat compared to what those toads did, but we are working to bring them back asap)



(Will put a paragraph connecting these thoughts here)

Sure, I'm happy living in a country that has slowed our population growth to a point that doesn't mean we HAVE to start living ontop of each other, we get our space, and I want to keep it that way.  We even have the luxury of going outside to play... to keep this lifestyle we will have to slow our consumption, to slow our consumption we need to slow our production of consumers, and well, that means protected sex I guess... less babies is better for all of us.
