- If you type **Ctrl-;** it enters today's date (a fixed one
- If you type **Ctrl-'** it looks at the cell above the cell pointer and copies it into the current cell.
- If you highlight an area and go into the Custom formatting category of the Number formatting
- If you right click the worksheet tab scrolling buttons (to the left of the sheet tabs)

Excel 2013 spoils my fun on that last one by adding a tooltip saying just that.

A more conceptual one that I try to point out to people who are past being beginners and starting to make more complex sheets with functions is that =IF and =VLOOKUP set to approximate matches are logically similar to one another. As a result, making your life simpler.

How can someone benefit from one using a helper column(s)?

* I want to calculate something on every X rows of my data.  Again, ie 1,2,3,1,2,3,2
  
  
* I need a conditional formula with multiple criteria.  Here is an example where multiple helper columns may be useful.  Say there are groups of date ranges (&lt;1Month, trains, automobiles).

A little over a year ago, I've updated the website and now have a [published book of Kansuko puzzles!](http://www.amazon.com/Kansuko-Game-Based-Classic-Sudoku/dp/0764342037)

**All of this made possible by EXCEL.**

Seriously

1. First

2. I wrote a macro to search the Sudokus for possible Kansuko puzzles. Each Sudoku has 6 possible Kansuko puzzles within it. This macro spit out completed Kansukos.

3. When I started

4. Ok

5. I started doing Daily Kansuko tumblr posts (took a break for now) - but this too

6. Let's make a book! I pitched it to a publisher, I could check to see if the puzzle was valid and how hard it was, and save it back to my master list.

7. Uh-oh

8. New website time! Revamped the website

And that's where we are today! This wasn't meant to be so much about me

This subreddit has really grown in the past year. It's amazing how fast posts are responded to by knowledgeable Excel gurus!

To help celebrate the book, I kept track of all the clues as I was making it in Excel and any other ... additional challenges ... were also done in Excel.  If you're bored on a Friday, give it a shot!

Well

I have a problem that requires I use VBA.  I wanted to do it using VSTO and C# (following my old advice) but it's just damn simpler to do it with VBA I think

I have a source data sheet.  It can be found here:
[Data Source](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B8qkD9NvB8dHQS1EQnZpTVlsZlE)

I have a target data sheet.  It can be found here:
[Data Target](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B8qkD9NvB8dHaEgwelVoRndmNnc)

The end result needs to look like this:
[Output Sheet](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B8qkD9NvB8dHenhwTnBQbVVGWTg)

Now, and create output in the target sheet - headers need to be created for each unique team, and within each team the rows need to be sorted by the number of hours.

I'm pulling my hair out on this one and I have a very complicated semi-solution right now.  I'm not even going to try to explain it

Best

But I still have one fundamental problem with the INDEX/MATCH combination that is simply not addressed without difficulty, or SQL.  
And that is: What if I need a list of values that matches a specific key? 

The question has been posed many times, this is now possible!""

Only it's not

So I tried to make myself a VBA function that gives me an array of matches:

____
    Public Function AMATCH(val As Variant
    Dim item As Variant
    Dim results As Variant
    Dim i As Integer
    
    ReDim results(0)
    
    'Debug.Assert 0
    For Each item In list
        i = i + 1
        If val = item Then
            ReDim Preserve results(UBound(results) + 1)
            results(UBound(results) - 1) = i
        End If
    Next item
    If UBound(results) &gt; 1 Then ReDim Preserve results(UBound(results) - 1)
    AMATCH = results
    End Function
    
____

And that works... but Excel interprets that array horizontally ONLY.

So if I have this:

K|L|
-|-|
2|January|
0|February|
1|March|
2|April|
0|May|
1|June|
2|July|
0|August|
1|September|
2|October|
0|November|
1|December|

I can only enter this as an array formula oriented horizontally (i.e. less usefully):

    {=INDEX($L$1:$L$13,0))}

If it's entered vertically

So

Ultimately I intend to include this AMATCH function in my toolkit add-in,False,,t5_2qur2,False,solvedcase,,t3_11p9nf

It's so non-intuitive

Here's a [screenshot](http://imgur.com/EbCdP) with my column headers. They should be self-explanatory. Under the Door columns, in each row, one car and two goats, here are the formulas in each cell (assuming row 2):

A2

    =RAND()&lt;1/3

B2

    =IF(A2

C2

    =NOT(OR(A2:B2))

There are other ways to do this part

D2

    =CEILING(RAND()*3

A simple random choice of which door the contestant chooses.

E2

    =IF(CHOOSE(D2,C2),CHOOSE(CEILING(RAND()*2,1),IF(A2,2,1),2,3,1)

There is probably a much better way of doing this part, this returns the other FALSE door, and if the contestant originally chose the TRUE door, it randomly returns one of the FALSE doors. This is the door that is ""revealed"" to have a goat behind it. At this point, the contestant is given the opportunity to choose the other door.

F2

    =CHOOSE(6-E2-D2,C2)

This returns TRUE if switching to the other door wins the car

G1 (the winning percentage)

    =COUNTIF(F:F

I copied the formulas in A2:F2 down to row 1001

Weird

**Edit:** working this out also helped me think of a way to explain why it works:

In this particular scenario, switching your guess will give you the correct door 100% of the time. Since your initial probability of choosing the correct door is 33%, vs. the initial probability of choosing the incorrect door at 67%, your chances of getting the correct one when you switch is 67%.",,False,,True,t3_j6p91

I've also noted that after I change the text colour of the whole sheet to black, because I coloured the sheet black and then thought ""Oh I should take more screen shots"" and then I couldn't get it to go back

1346946871.0,zgctk,Problem solved: Pull out the dollar amount from this text field,Sacamato,12,4,5,"I'm not always able to answer the questions that come up in this sub-reddit

**""Can you pull the dollar amount out of this text field?""**  
Example:

    Amount : $17.86 debited from A/C # : XXXXXXXXXXXXX  towards the Legal Amount

(Account number removed to protect the innocent.)

Easy, let's say these text fields are in column A, and you want just the dollar amount in column B (data starts in row 1):

    =VALUE(MID(A1,FIND("" "",A1,FIND(""$"",A1))-FIND(""$"",A1)-1))

MID is the backbone here. MID takes three inputs: the text you're pulling from, and should be self-explanatory.

The first input in MID is easy: A1. It's the field we're pulling from.

    MID(A1

The second input, it will give us the starting point for our MID function. We have to then add 1 to that result, so we don't actually pull the dollar sign in. We want to start with the character immediately following the dollar sign.

    MID(A1

The third input, but this time we use the optional third input for FIND for a starting point. So we tell FIND to give us the position of the first space, but tell it to start at the first dollar sign. Now we have the position of that space, and the position of that dollar sign. If we find the difference, it will give us the number of characters between those two points, which tells the MID function how many characters to pull. We do have to subtract 1 from the result so that it doesn't actually pull that space, though. Just like we added 1 when we didn't want it to pull the dollar sign.

    MID(A1,FIND("" "",A1,FIND(""$"",A1))-FIND(""$"",A1)-1)

Finally

    =VALUE(MID(A1,FIND("" "",A1,FIND(""$"",A1))-FIND(""$"",A1)-1))

Background: This dataset is from palm pilots that were used by school kids to record their moods, etc. I am conducting a secondary analysis of this data.

The dataset I recieved had no times, there is either a 1 or a 0 assigned in the SCHOOL_WORK column. There then a difference column, and based on this the macro generates a % of school attendance.

The problems that need to be tweaked are:
1. There are entries the students sometimes don't answer..they may skip the question or miss the entry entirely. The current macro assigns these a 1 and because they never replied to the prompt there is nothing in the SCHOOL_WORK column

2. The macro sometimes counts days that are not thursday or friday. If there is a way so that on saturday and sunday there is never a % reflected that would be great (though not a big deal...).

#1 is my biggest issue. The dataset had over 600

TL;DR Macro is broken help me!!!!!

Love this subreddit; I've been thrown into a very Excel/VBA heavy workplace this summer
Thanks for your time in advance

Unfortunately I can't provide the sheet I'm working on (company policy; I can't move any files off my encrypted

##The situation
There is a part in a product my company makes.  We want to change an allowable limit to be lower over a period of time.  This will increase the demand in the part as they are replaced.  Thus

That's where I come in.  I am in charge of modeling/forecasting the demand for this part over the replacement period.  

##How the book works
I have a list of about 4000 parts (the ones currently in the field) and their current lifetimes in hours. Each part is a row.
Each column is a month; I must provide data for 84 months starting Jan 14.  Each month

Finally

##The pesky part
Modeling the random 8% of parts in the shop has been tricky.  This is my current

In another sheet
In the model

Now this works fine, generated with a generator that lets me assign a probability of 1 occurring.  Same problem; way too many values to run a simulation with.  

With frozen randoms

##What I've tried.
I have access to an Excel add-in called Oracle Crystal Ball.  It provides random generation and simulation support.  
Essentially

The problem is, and processing time is horrendous.  Even if it could, I'm convinced the simulation itself - varying 350,000 values and tracking the results in 84 cells - would take days of computing.  I don't have access to a sim rig at work (they use them for things more important than intern projects).  

##Help me please!
Thanks for reading through my problem... I'm going to try to make a mock-up sheet for explanation purposes on my personal computer and link it here.  

Any help in making this work is hugely appreciated!

###EDIT: Solved!

Just wanted to let everyone know that I figured it out.  When making the dummy sheet to share, as the random generation is offloaded to Excel (faster, because Excel doesn't keep statistics on them).

I've been asked to help with a conference, wasteful approach that could easily be fixed with some straightforward excel skills. Unfortunately, mine only extend to conditional formatting and other basics... I only know enough about pivot tables to respect them.

Still, as deadlines are approaching.

So here's the overview:

I have two excel databases (approx 200 &amp; 500 records so far).

One is a list of conference attendees and their contact info.

The other is a list of meetings these people will be attending when in town . 

**What I want to do is create an email to go to each of the attendees with meetings

While it would be ideal to have a program to prep the emails automatically


Complications:

* ~~The meeting list does not have email addresses

* **Some attendees have 7 meetings, so names are repeated in the meeting database. (I don't know how to address this in the mail merge)** I just want to send 1 email per person, summarizing their meeting list.

I want to know how to do this, but if you can help guide me through this in a hands on way, that would be amazing. I have googled this extensively, have worked through several tutorials, but am realizing that this is still more than I will probably be able to learn in the time I have without someone more experienced.

I needed to format some URLs and put some code before them and in between them in order to redirect bad old URLs to new URLs.

The project started with needing to insert some characters into the URLs:

-    Adding \ before ? or ( or )

I ran into some trouble on this step because ""?"" is a wildcard in excel

-    Change &amp; to &amp;amp.
This was no problem

After that I needed to combine the URLs and put some text in front of them, so that it would look like this:

&lt;redirect url=""^/old-link"" to=""/new-link"" /&gt;

I entered each of the following into separate cells:

&lt;redirect url=""^

"" to=""

"" /&gt;

After that I used the CONCATENATE function to combine them.

=CONCATENATE(D2)&amp;(A2)&amp;(E2)&amp;(B2)&amp;(F2) 
where A2 and B2 are the URLs that needed to be redirected.

I'm wondering if there's some way I can make this easier? Right now people have to copy/paste their data to my updated book and then re-adjust their columns and whatnot to get back to the way they want it.

These are very basic users and I'm still learning. I have no problems working on some more complex stuff to make it happen but the other users of the book won't be able to and if it gets too troublesome they'll just stop.

EDIT: I'll give a bit of an example. Sheet1 is tracking, some is customized individually. Sheet3 is all formula's.

In the A column I have dates, which is a sum for that row's sighs. Finally, in B2, on the same row as the individual totals, I have a grand total, which is a sum from C2:AG2 (I don't actually have anything in AG yet though). 

So I tried in C3 to do =C2/B2

 I usually can figure out most excel related questions using the ol' Google method but for some reason (maybe because I'm searching for the wrong thing) I cannot solve this one!

I am definitely a programming amateur but I think this issue is easily doable for you more proficient excel-ers. Basically what I'm trying to do is to use the numerical value of a cell (i.e. H14) as the number of a cell in a formula.
So let's say the value of H14 is 200 (a # which I input manually)

An example of the type of formula I'm using is Count(F50:F100

Is there a way to basically say Count(F50:F(value of H14)
so it will essentially be Count(F50:F200

so that the references match the actual Array on the real work, perhaps since all of the data in the Target Array is derived and not manually entered, there may be some issue with referencing it in an Array formula? or perhaps its because the references I'm using cover more than the Basic 3 column format in the original example? 

still puzzling...

1367874058.0,1dtegy,Dynamic Ranges: Index vs Offset,StrahansToothGap,5,0,12,"Hi all

I have been using dynamic rangers for a while and have used two methods (index and offset)

With the offset method,helper!A1,1,0,0).  I then make one of these each for every column.

With the index method,COUNTA(Data!$1:$1))

Then,1).

I am running into performance issues with each.  I have read that offset is volatile, typing anything in any cell, etc.).  It renders the sheet completely useless, especially when calculations are on.  

With the index method, the entire workbook is VERY slow.  Slow when opening, saving, closing, etc.  It's like Excel takes a very long time to LOAD this method, but not long to calculate -- if that makes sense.  And the complete opposite of this for the offset method.  The index method causes every computer I open it up on to freeze for a good 5 minutes before opening -- with only a few dynamic ranges and only about 1000 rows and 20 columns of data.


Has anyone found these issues?  Am I doing something wrong?  Is there a way I can speed it up?

Selecting the 5:30 and 6:30 cells and using the fill box to drag the times to the right I populate the empty cells to 9:30. As you can see there's a small decimal discrepancy between 9:30 entered manually and the 9:30 entered using the drag-to-fill feature.

Since the times are displayed accurately the issue only becomes apparent when testing for equality. As you can see it fails a test of equality in AB107.

I assume this is a result of Excel storing and computing values as decimal values internally and this shows up as a rounding error but the results are quite different from what would be expected and would go undetected until someone tries to test for equivalency (like I did).",,t5_2qur2,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/1des3i/getting_different_time_values_when_using/

We also have to report our monthly figures on a different sheet

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/bq7mNIY.png)

I would really like to find a way to automatically fill the monthly spreadsheet with the daily one, so i can't use simple links without having a huge daily report sheet which contains mostly zero values for activities. I guess it would need something that looks at the title of each activity above the figures and puts it in the relevant bit on the monthly report, but i have no idea how to do this...

Thanks in advance for your help :)

**Backstory:** I have a spreadsheet ""catalog"" of colors my customers can choose from.  Mostly they use an automated tool to do this, I want to clean up this customer catalog, so they only see the most commonly used ""Aqua.""  Then, I want to keep a record of colors I hide in case we ever get around to actually cleaning up the database.  

**Excel:** I have a spreadsheet with about 1000 lines of colors on it, ""Color Family"" is the Family the color is in, and ""#"" is the number of items that color is in use on.  I would like an easy way to isolate the items that are not the highest in the # column for their respective color/colorfamily.  Then I would like to relate them to their highest counterpart in the color/colorfamily, so that I can have a page similar to [**this log.**](http://imgur.com/y1498.png)  

My first thought was to use some nested Ifs to compare a color/colorfamily combination to the entry above it/below it and try and decide if it was higher or lower.  For example, I had:  

    =IF(AND(A3=A2,""Higher"",""Lower""),IF(AND(A3=A4,C3=C4),IF(D3&gt;D4,""Higher"",""""))  

Which is ugly, I could filter on the lowers, those are the removes, and then filter on the highers, and those are my replacements.  It does not, however, work for triples.  

Anyone have any good brain-thoughts on how I can get this accomplished?  I suppose I could also try to think of some way to easily identify the triples and take them out of the mix

Thanks a bunch for reading!  Happy end of the year.

**EDIT!** - Point the first: My dataset is already limited to dup/triplicates.  That ugly ""samesies"" formula above sorted that out.  The original list was ~40

Point the second:I did not even think to use the default ""Sort"" function to get my most used variant to the top of its particular color/color family.  Fraudster pointed out that after I do that

**Solved** Indeed fraudster's method worked well.  Here is what I ended up doing:  

* Helper Colum to eliminate ""ANDS"" and sort out same colors in two different color families. So

    =CONCATENATE(A

* Sort based on my concat value
* Column F got a counter

    =IF(E2=E1

* Then finally in G, or the top value shows up if it is not the highest.  ""Concat"" is my named range for all my concatenated color/color families, and ""Codes"" is my named range for all the Color Codes.  

    =IF(F2=1,MATCH(O2,Concat,0)))  

* After that I just filtered on not ""KEEP!"" and my visible data was colors I wanted to hide with the alternate code visible in column G.  Just what I wanted.",,t5_2qur2,1356628474.0,solvedcase,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/15hvrp/looking_for_logic_help_on_finding_the_most_used/

(and doesn't need to)  We successfully grab the data we want off ""Sheet1""

I want to get rid of that error message, so my first thought was simply to put all the ""grabbing data from 'Output'"" into an if statement that first checks if the worksheet exists.  If so, grab the data, if not, go on and finish the sub.  

Question the first: Does this sound like a logical way to do this?  There are about 40 lines of code that grab data from Output

Question the second: assuming it is a decent way to go about it

    Function WorksheetExists(n As String) As Boolean
      Dim ws As Worksheet
      WorksheetExists = False
      For Each ws In Worksheets
        If n = ws.Name Then
          WorksheetExists = True
        End If
      Next ws 
    End Function  

I am preliminarily testing my function before integrating it into the macro by simply putting into a cell somewhere:  

    =WorksheetExists(Output)  

And all I get in return regardless is #VALUE.  I am reasonably certain this is yet another case of me missing something fairly obvious that one of you will notice almost immediately.  

Thanks a bunch!


**EDIT** - I will probably just use CoffeeAlcohol's solution to use error handling to handle this error. (Imagine that!)  

**EDIT 2** - Also

    =WorksheetExists(Output)  

When I should have been using  

    =WorksheetExists(""Output"")

My coworkers and I have a large amount of data we pull from another program

When we originally created the macro

    'Find Erronious Entry - 057277
        Cells.Find(What:=""57277"", LookAt _
        :=xlWhole, MatchCase:= _

     ActiveCell.EntireRow.Select
    Selection.Delete Shift:=xlUp  

Just today I had to add another item to delete from this sheet, I am not an excel expert, and only mildly ""proficient.""  My first thought was to create in this blank pre-format and sorted sheet a static list of all the different entries we wanted to delete, and then stepping through that to delete entries.  However I feel like there should be a way to do it within the macro, somewhere at the top declaring a variable that will contain all the entries we want to delete.  Then, when next we need to add something to the list, all we need to do is add another entry to that variable.  

Does it make sense to do it this way?  If so

Hope someone here can help me out

PM me for a copy of a Test Workbook which has examples of what the workbook could look like and what the  macro should readout.

Or find it on the post I made on some Excel forum [here!](http://www.excelforum.com/excel-programming/844271-help-with-a-macro-to-extract-specific-data-from-large-workbook-extensive-details-inside.html)

I believe the programming logic I wrote is sound. I’m using Excel 2003

Source material is a large workbook with tons of data and multiple sheets; I just want to create a single sheet having each SKU associated with a specific cost. I’m pretty sure a macro would be the best way to approach this, it's always in Column A). 

I'm not sure how time-consuming this macro would take to write but I think it would be pretty simple for someone who is as familiar with the syntax as I used to be.

Any/All help is greatly appreciated!

Here is what I need to do:


1.	Create a new workbook

* a.	Label A1 = “SKU”
* b.	Label B1 = “Net Landed Cost”


2. For each sheet “N” in workbook search Column A for the first occurrence of “Net Landed Cost” to determine the Row “X” we will be extrapolating data from. When there are no more sheets “N” remaining

3. I suppose I need to make a loop “n” to move across Row(“X”) horizontally starting at column B (as column A will be labeled “Net Landed Cost”)

*   	IF Cell at (Column location n in loop
this cell into sheet “Z”
data from Cell=(Column location n in loop, to the next available empty row in Column A
. (These should both be in the same row

*  	IF Cell at (Column location n in loop

*  	WHEN no further columns in Row(“X”) have data (e.g. end of the worksheet horizontally)


	Here are some concerns I have that may or may not be issues in writing this macro: 

*	Ensuring that the Row “X” is determined by the first instance of “Net Landed Cost” as “Net Landed Cost” will appear multiple times in Column A of each sheet.

*	Row “X” (which has my costs), And we are at n=Column AB in the loop, the Cost will be in CELL(AB11) and the SKU will be in CELL(AB1). 

*	Ensuring that the loop moves on to the next sheet after completing Row “X”. I do not want the data from further occurrences of “Net Landed Cost

*	Ensuring that the loop for Row “X” moves across columns all the way to the last column with data

*	Ensuring that when copying data over to sheet “Z” (place 2&gt;b&gt;i in outline)

Hey everyone
nor even done much programming at all in my life (yet). There are some tasks I am trying to perform with in an excel workbook that 
has hundreds upon hundreds of sheets. I have all my data recorder
itself where needed
I have written a notepad file that discusses more in depth what I am looking for
Like I said I do not have enough experience with programming
look and be designed. You will notice I tried to set it up like it was a line of code
translated. I tried my best to make it easy to understand by writing it this way. So that if you help me you do not have to think of how 
it will work
few values

The ones I really need the most I labeled as ""APPLYING CITY"" and ""APPLYING ZONE"". The other one would just be helpful.
Also I want to make sure if functions are incorporated into the code
it is locked in and no matter how i edit the file
of me changing a corresponding cell that was in the function
ex: 
if F3 is ""hi"" make G5 ""bye""
this is all true so F3 actually is ""hi"" and so G5 actually changes to  ""bye"" 
then I change F3 to ""Thank you so much Reddit I love you""
but regardless G5 remains ""bye""

Thank you guys so much I just don't what I am doing here and if you have the time I would really appreciate the help. 
I completely understand I am asking for a lot here but otherwise this would take weeks if i did it manually
so let the race begin for the discovery of who shall outshine amongst the rest and perform this most daunting task 
and pull through this most treacherous quest. I will award you 560

* 3. I fill in my sheet.

So is there a function I can use for the column headers that will look for the first “Y” and put the name, I need the formula to look for the first instance of “N” and make that the first row heading, and the second row heading would be populated with the second instance of “N”.

I've used lists and data validation to create dropdowns, so each cell only allows certain things, like a disk is up, down, whatever.

What I want to add is a way so that conditional on each possibility for each cell there will be a list, each list is printed. So when you make changes to the state of anything in any one of the ~25 sheets, it's dynamically added to a summary page. That way if I want to see all of the disks that are down, I don't have to go through 25 sheets, and write them down, I just have a list on a separate sheet. Is that remotely possible?

    IF(11.8&lt;=13.2,""NOT OK""),""NOT OK"")  ===&gt; OK

I know I can nest the IF statements, and if I have to modify any portion of it I'll have to hunt through that long ass string.  Is there a way to simplify that comparison so I can avoid nesting 10 IF statments?  Some formula that I'm missing?

I can get excel to calculate / record a column of data with the time period I am wanting (say every 4 minutes) but how do get the corresponding temperature value alongside it?

So far I have

column A: time (every 10 sec)

Column B: temperature

column C: recorded time at my chosen value ( used a cell with hh:mm;@ and picked a 4 minute period)

Column D: I want the corresponding temperature to value calculated in C taken from my 50000+ values.

=IF(COUNTIF(B:B,""=""&amp;INDEX(C:C,MATCH(""ace"",B:B,0)))=2,IF(INDEX(C:C,MATCH(""ace"",0))=G2,0)

Where G2=C (and H2=D, suited non-aces, but I think I have that taken care of.

The issue is the case where there is more than one ace, ace of diamonds, ace of clubs, then checking for 2 clubs with an ace returns 0 from this formula, instead of 10 like it should. This is because the match/index finds the first ace (diamonds), but never sees the second (clubs), so it doesn't give the points for ace of clubs suited match. The ace of diamonds suited match works fine

Anyway this is probably too much to just take in

You can ignore the ""pairs"" part because that works how it should. Any help would really be appreciated,,False,,t5_2qur2,False,,True

Some background info.  I have 5 locations: 1 being a storage area and 4 being shops that get supplies from this location.  Let's use toilet paper (TP) and paper towels (PT) for simplification.  I would like to do the following:




LOCATIONS:

* A separate inventory sheet
* It would be cool if the sheet could notify the locations on monday to inventory their TP and PT.
* These will be linked to a master sheet
* They will also notify the master sheet or me when each locations needs more TP or PT. 


MASTER SHEET:



* A master inventory sheet that keeps track of a stock pile held in storage that is held at a different location than the 4 above.  
* The master sheet will have quantity on hand, etc.  and I would like it to notify me via email when stock reaches a certain threshold and tell me when to order more.
* As stated above I would like this sheet to notify me when any of the 4 locations needs TP or PT
* It would be nice if this sheet could track usage of the TP and PT for each of the 4 locations to see if anyone is being wasteful.

I have a list of text/numbers of the form TM-XXX-YYY-ZZZ-AA (X,A being numbers). These are stored in a huge directory and sub directorys which takes the form ..TM-001-YYY-ZZZ-AA/TM-001-001-ZZ-AA/TM-001-001-001-AA/Revision A/FILE.

I've managed to export the directory structure into a spreadsheet

What I need to do is look at each line on my initial list

I'm kinda stumped now as VLOOKUP/FIND/MID etc don't seem to be working so any assistance would be very much appreciated.

Cheers

J

**EDIT** Thanks for all the Help. I got some good tips here. I ended up doing a MID with a SEARCH for ""Revision"" then doing a MID with a SEARCH for ""TM"" and then text to column which has given me what I needed.
