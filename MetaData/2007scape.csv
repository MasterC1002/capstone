Jagex's support is just awful in comparison to that of companies like Blizzard and Riot. A 2 week (and counting delay) is just ridiculous. Also, Jagex aren't even going to manage that.

I will update this when more ideas come to me,000 word limit. Feel free to add your own tips to the comments and I will gladly add them to this post. I hope you find some of these useful/interesting.

***Because this is a self-post
  
**Combat**

* [**Here's the best max hit calculator for OSRS**](http://web.archive.org/web/20080601230937/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=max_hit_calc.htm)

* Using Hawk Eye instead of Eagle Eye when training range is much more cost efficient as it drains twice as slowly and gives only 2/3 less bonuses.

* Use a monkey skip task to train on the Monkey Guards at Ape Atoll.  You get the Black Mask's bonuses as well as a free source of prayer.

* Broad arrows (55 slayer) are very cost-efficient ammo (they have a ranged strength between mithril and adamant arrows).  Buy a few hundred per world (at any slayer master) and then hop.

* The best way to kill Green Dragons is by using the Carrallangar teleport (84 magic) to the Graveyard of Shadows and running north.  Once you have a full inventory

* The best place to kill trolls for a slayer task is the Ice Trolls north of Jatiszo.  You should pray melee and wear a Fremennik round shield to reduce the damage from the female thrower trolls.  The drops often cover the cost of cannonballs

* If you're doing a Dagannoth task with low defense, very do-able, even while using a cannon.

* When using a long-range attack (range/magic) on a NPC from the north (the monster being south of you),"" but will instead wander around normally without immediately drawing you back into its range.  This is useful when training range/magic at a location without safespots (Green Dragons, for example).

* Monk's robes give the same prayer bonus as Initiate platebody and legs.

* The Warrior ring is a very underrated item.  It provides +4 slash attack and defense bonus while the Berserker ring provides +4 strength and crush defense. However





**Skillling**

* Smithing can be trained quickly while making a little profit by making unfinished bolts.  Make mithril at level 54 and adamant at level 73.

* Adding feathers to your unfinished bolts is *extremely* quick and overlooked fletching xp. Set up mouse keys so you can quickly switch between two inv. spaces, you can feather bolts just about anywhere in the game while doing anything as long as you have 3 open inv. spaces.

* The Spellbook Swap spell (96 magic) on the lunar spellbook is extremely underrated.  It allows you to complete full herb runs (all 5 patches) on the lunar spellbook.  Use it to switch to the standard spellbook, an Ectophial, and a Glory teleport (or a Falador teletab if you want to do your tree on the way) to the Draynor patch.

* Using (super) energy potions while training agility is **well worth** your time. [This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1ia9ot/one_more_to_go/cb3cwpe) explains that if you can make ~200k gp per hour

* Baskets of strawberries are the best single inv. space healing item other than purple sweets (6 hp per strawberry

* The Plank-Make spell (86 magic) is an effective way to train magic. You can buy mahogany logs (or collect them from Kingdom Management) and convert them to mahogany planks for a little profit.  This is very click-intensive but it's faster xp than alching.




**Getting Around**

* [**This is the best fairy ring map for OSRS**](http://images.wikia.com/runescape/images/archive/3/38/20111120221912!Fairy_ring_map.png)

* [**A more detailed map**](http://i.imgur.com/R90x1Gz.jpg)

* The quickest way to access the fairy rings is by using the Kharyll teleport (66 magic) to Canifis and running west.  It's useful to have a teleport room in your house with a Kharyll portal so you can do this on any spellbook.

* The quickest way to access the spirit trees (without having a spirit tree patch) is teleporting to castle wars and using a magic log to fly to the Tree Gnome Stronghold.  This requires the completion of Enlightened Journey and 60 firemaking.

* The quickest way(s) to access the charter ship system is by using either the Khazard teleport (78 magic) or the Catherby teleport (87 magic)

* You can reduce the cost of charter ships by taking an indirect route to your destination instead of traveling directly there (like a layover flight).

* The quickest way to access the Wilderness obelisks is using the Ghorrock Teleport (96 magic) on the ancient spellbook.  It puts you right next to the obelisk in 44 wilderness near the Ice Plateau.  This is useful when doing level 3 clues.

* You can get a free teleport from the Shantay Pass to Port Sarim by threatening to kill Shantay and refusing to pay up in the jail cell.  You'll end up in the Port Sarim jail.

* The quickest way to switch to the Lunar spellbook (other than getting teleothered by another player - W2 Edgeville is the best place to find someone for this, then going to the adjacent dock where Lokar Searunner is in Rellekka (**don't forget your seal of passage**). This method is also good when you need to switch from the Ancient spellbook to the normal spellbook because it's faster than going to the ancient pyramid.

* High Alching while you run lowers the rate at which your run energy drains.





**NPCs/Stores**

* You can buy the same drinks found in the Falador pub in the Games Room in multiples of 10.  This is useful for obtaining Wizard Mind Bombs.

* When buying runes in the Magic Guild, meaning you make 5k per world.

* The best way to stock up on vials and eyes of newts is by using a normal log on the balloon system near Castle Wars and going to Taverly.  Then run west to the shop

* Opals, you can mine these gems in the gem mine.

* Jekyll will give you different potions for having different herbs in your inventory. In exchange for a cadantine



**Player Interaction**

* When buying/selling less common items on Zybez (mahogany planks, people will pay more/sell for less to save time.  In other words, focus less on the trade prices and more on the times at which the offers were created.

* Press tab to quick reply to the last message sent or received (you have to have that person added


**Other**

* Entering and leaving a portal at Castle Wars will restore your health and prayer.

* When running around under the threat of NPC and player attacks when you have no intention of fighting back (like training rcing in the abyss or scoring a flag in Castle Wars)

* The Zybez Price Guide lists the high and low alchemy values of all items.  Use this when choosing items to alch. (Hint: yew longs are *far* from the most ideal item).

* If you find yourself running out of bank space, and treasure trails items.

* Type ""::toggleroof"" in chat without quotes to remove roofs

------------
The argument for some users is that if they're not botting, Pking and staking is a lot more intense, challenging and enjoyable when you've got good stats and decent gear, but that defeats the purpose of the game.
And then we have some people who bot just because it's openly available to them

All of these mindsets, or make a profit from real world trading, cuts the life expectancy of this game in half. By botting, you are not only ruining the game for yourself in the longterm, but the entire playerbase. 


It's been proven time and time again with countless other MMO/MMORPG games. Bots are released


I just had an hour long chat with two fellows regarding bots and RWT, you work hard for what you get - just like in real life. If you don't like it, go play on the EOC servers, another private server, or better yet, a different game. 


I'm writing this post in hopes people will say NO to bots, stop botting, report every bot you see, and spread the word that botting WILL destroy this game. 

Please please please, everybody begins to get that mindset and suddenly we're playing EOCscape again, where you can't go a single second w/o hearing a bot screaming ""SELLING RS GOLD"". 

You CAN make a difference! Just because you don't see it now doesn't mean it's not working.

Don't get me wrong - these people deserve all the kudos in the world, because it's a really big achievement, but god damn if it doesn't make me feel inadequate.

It appears that whilst many of us jubilantly celebrated the manual banning of a large number of bots

If you were banned and weren't and have never used a botting program then please heed the following advice. If you were botting and got pissed that you got caught then don't bother; you ran the risk

* Email -  accounthelp@jagex.com
* Send a POLITE, and no-one had intentions of banning accounts that have done nothing wrong.
* Include the following account details;  Your username, do not send your password.
* You can also consider sending a letter to their HQ

Whilst the situation is beyond frustrating I cannot stress enough how much a polite and refrained message will make the process of regaining your account much faster and less painful.

Might I also suggest that ONE of you posts a polite

Finally

I sincerely hope the Mods read this post and take action to rectify any mistakes made when removing bots.  


Best of luck guys - keep us up to date with any progress.

After using excalibur for the defence boost (shouting ""For Camelot!"" running into a dragon fight is rather fun) I swung the sword and hit 0.  I kept having bad hits and Elvarg was ripping me to shreds.  I started thinking I was ill prepared

-It would be in the same place as the GE is in EoC (so it's easy to find)

-The main purpose of it is to have a system like the GE: Request a trade to buy or sell item(s). However

-The prices would be completely user determined.

-The message would *not* be custom. It would follow a certain form: &lt;Username&gt; is &lt;Selling/Buying&gt; &lt;Amount&gt; &lt;Item&gt; for &lt;Price Each&gt;.

1364525159.0,1b7wvj,Tips to be successful,SuperCrayon,80,11,80,"Hey I'm here to give some people a few tips that will help them in this game.

Some info on my account:
I have a total level of 1020.
My 2 highest stats are 80 hunter and 65 smiting. (both ranked in the top 1000)
I have 70 quest points.
I have around a 15m bank value.
I play around 3.5 hours a day.

I know my stats aren't extremely impressive but I still feel these tips will help a lot of you.

1- Do Throne of Miscelinia and Royal trouble

2- Get in the habit of doing regular farm runs. 32 farming is required for ranarr weeds and 38 farming is required for toadflax seeds. Ranarr seeds make slightly more profit
Doing ghost ahoy is helpful to get the ectophile to teleport to the canafis farming patch. (you can also use the fairy wings)

Doing my big arms adventure is another helpful quest that allows you to use a disease free farming patch

You can do a herb run every 1.5 hours




3- Picking a skill and sticking with it for a while will be very beneficial




4- Make your own jewellery. This one isn't very important but I constantly see people buying a dueling ring for 5k in some random bank. I've gotten so many gems from random events (and im sure you have also) that I have enough rings of dueling




5- Don't sit around in banks doing nothing.




6- Avoid things like nat running. Running nature runes is okay if you need some start up cash but don't rely on it as you long term source of income as you get no xp from it and it would be much more helpful to put in the time yourself and get 44 rc to craft your own nats.Things like picking flax also fall under this category.



7- Always check the second trade screen!!!!!!(it's so simple just read).



These are the few tips I could think of

1363890445.0,1aqwe3,The next content poll - Presenting both arguments so you don't have to,ZeldenGM,68,3,90,"Today Jagex announced the planned set of questions for the next [content poll.](http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/DevBlog:First_Old_School_RuneScape_Content_Poll#F2P_worlds_for_PKers) This post will aim to summarise these questions

**Discussion** of these polls should be conducted with **respect for other players opinions** and with consideration to all members of the community.

Now without further ado..

* **Improved routefinding**
This will aim to address issues such as 'cant reach that' when clicking on interactable objects from a distance (for example agility shortcuts) as well as route-finding in combat to prevent 'dancing around.'

**Pros:** Smoother gameplay


**Cons:** *Possibly* improves the ability of bots to interact with the game.

* **Themed Worlds** 
This will mark certain worlds for certain activities based on forum posts on the old-school forums. For example world 2 being marked as a trade world.

**Pros:** Easier to find groups for team-based objectives. Easier to trade/run runes

**Cons:** ""Forces"" people to use certain worlds. Potentially increases overpopulation of certain servers.

* **Stop agility bottlenecks**
This patch will prevent messages such as 'this is currently in use' with relation to agility obstacles - For example the two pipes in the gnome agility course.

**Pros:** Makes agility experience smoother. Prevents queues on busy worlds. Gives fair platform for players regardless of connection speeds.

**Cons:** Graphical glitches with players overlapping. 

* **Mouse Camera**
This patch will introduce the ability to rotate and change the in-game camera angle by holding down the mouse buttons

**Pros:** Gives an alternative option to change camera angle which may suit some players

**Cons:** None?

* **Login Queues**
This feature will place players in a queue when trying to enter a world that is currently full instead of giving the message 'this server is full

**Pros:** *Possibly* makes connecting to popular worlds easier

**Cons:** Creates transparency in how overcrowded some worlds are which *may* lead to backlash due to high queue timers.
Encourages players to wait for a single server as opposed to making use of emptier ones

* **F2P PvP Worlds.**
This question has returned to the poll after a high vote base on the last set of polls

**Pros:** Grants players that want the F2P PvP experience the platform to do so
Provides a long-term economy for non-member items such as rune armour, etc
Offers great diversity of PvP options

**Cons:** *Arguably* splits the community and *arguably* reduces the size of the current pvp playerbase on members worlds.
Players which have already lvl'd skills on the basis that there wouldn't be F2P PvP feel 'cheated'


**Summary**

This summarises the next poll and possible pros and cons for each question. Please remember that the pros and cons put forward here are *suggestions* and **not** set in stone facts. Almost all of these points can be argued either way

Also if a feature doesn't interest you

This post will remain in the sidebar for quick-reference so please direct all discussion relating to the polls here. ",self,t5_2wbww,False,,forummod,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1aqwe3/the_next_content_poll_presenting_both_arguments/

I am bringing 500 cabbages to distribute to team Alpha personally

**Everyone who is attending please add me. My RSN: Old Ralvn ----- I am Eastern time US.**

I made a small album on how to pick cabbage more efficiently. Credit for the idea goes to CluelessAtLife. It would really help me out if you brought some of your own because picking 1k cabbage is no fun I can promise. Sacks can fill with 10 cabbages by the way.

This is quite strange considering that I have never once used a macro in all the years I've played runescape (used to play back in the old days and came back for 07scape). What's even weirder is that I usually talk to the people around me while I'm skilling

Has this kind of mistake ever happened to anyone else? Did you get your account access back? I can't help but feel a bit spited because of this.

""**Will I be able to appeal a ban I was given for macroing?**

I can only hope they will review the evidence and see I am very active in chat and have never used any kind of macroing.

Here's how you do it!,YOUR_VERY_STUPID,59,7,33,"This piece of shit quest is unfun and tedious and it took me a solid four hours to do it last night, and I died when they didn't fully explain things. So this is just a compilation of all the information that would have saved my ass from dying thrice getting the greegree!

There are a few hard bits to survive.

The first irritating bit is the animals. Scorpions kept hitting 14s on me. Fuck scorpions.

To survive these, log out while you do it. Pretty obvious, but it needs to be said.

Secondly, a super anti (they respawn in goblin village near observatory, southernmost building), the items you need (grabbing spares really couldn't hurt at all, going through this extra times is really fucking annoying), and 4-5 four-dose energy potions. You should be able just to run straight through while continuously chugging potions and eating food.

The part of the quest I had most difficulty with was getting through the temple to make the amulet. I eventually figured it out. Firstly

Then you'll need to run to the northeast corner- don't be scared of the monkeys, a nice safe spot. Around the back of that pit of fire you can't be touched. Go south a little, staying within the safe zone, and watch the trapdoor and the gorillas guarding it.

These gorillas are the reason this is so difficult and you can't just run through. They'll block you completely if you try to move through them, and there are 0 squares you can move to. This is what we're avoiding.

You have complete vision of these gorillas, you'll end up right next to a bunch of zombie monkeys trying to forcibly penetrate you with skeleton bananas or whatever the hell they hit you with. Use the monkey bar on the weird firey shit to the east, and tele out of there.

The boss fight was actually way shorter and less painful than those two awful areas. I simply three itemed it. If you get one-shot by the demon, and try again. The demon can't hit you if you run across one of those bamboo bridges. Get over there and if you haven't died, cheer a little, pull the demon to where all the gnomes are and where you can see a tiny corner of its health bar, and go make a sandwich or something. Come back in 5 minute and you'll see that the demon has an almost entirely red bar- you just need to go hit it once. If it kills you as you kill it, that's fine- you get completion anyway. Just repeat this and it won't take too long to beat the demon.

Also- a word of advice, or you will lose it and have to make another one.

Good luck and enjoy what's pretty much the best weapon in the game!  ",self,t5_2wbww,False,,hunter,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/19ea3d/guide_monkey_madness_with_low_hp_and_43_prayer/

I was fletching at Varrock West bank and talking to my friend. He logged out without saying goodbye or anything which i though was really strange. I saw him log into another world and then immediately go off. luckily i saw which world it was and turned my pm off and hopped.

I logged into the world and couldn't see him anywhere

I went up the ladder and straight away realized what was going on. I stood on top of him as items started appearing on the ground. He had hacked my other friend and was drop trading his items!

Luckily i got EVERYTHING apart from the black mask

Just felt like sharing a thought...

I have finals in a month. I should study. I should ""grind"", and experiencing the current 07RS -- I've learned that efficiency is the key. I never really gotten a 99 even after 8 years of Runescape because I just did whatever I felt like, but coming back to 07RS has taught me to approach this game efficiently, through questing, through sticking to a skill to train, through the simple idea of NO EXP WASTE.

And now that my finals are in 1 month... I felt that this spirit really resonated with me a learner. I'd grind my textbooks and study like a badass because I can't afford to lose any XP. Every second of not doing anything is losing XP. Every moment I miss is an opportunity I've shattered. And slowly it accumulates to once big chunk of opportunity cost that I must endure for my future.

I'm only 17 and there's a huge road ahead of me. I didn't come this far for no reason.

So let's get grinding. I'll see you bastards in a month!

What bothers me so much is that my ability to make any gp off of my hard work is being questioned.

When I ask how much they'll pay me

**""Don't you want free exp?""** they ask me. No, but without me their ores would be useless. If you want an addy scimitar, buy one. If you have ores, but don't have the ability to make them into something, then sell the ores to someone who does.

Ukem: You haven't watched it? lol go to RuneClips and type in ""klabbs is a noob""

Now, one would be intrigued.

So I go to this site and I see [this](http://imgur.com/yA3T07r), but in all honesty this does resemble a Runescape-related fansite and it is pretty convincing. From this point on it resembles a traditional scam, where you go to watch a video and ""your java is not updated"" where you're prompted to update, which contains a phishing program.

I just think that this hack is intricate enough for someone to potentially fall for and I would hate to see that happen. It raises questions in your head that a ""normal"" scam doesn't do and it can trigger a number of responses. ""A popular runescape uploader called me out? That's infuriating/interesting/incredible!"" These are all responses that can distract you from seeing the truth of this concept.

This post wasn't entirely created to watch out for this Ukem guy, curiosity) and can serve as the perfect distraction to be scammed. and C) Like everything to do with this game, it is important to be careful of third-party links and be cautious of everything, and you will not be scammed (also always wear a Ring of Life, no questions asked! haha)

I'd appreciate if you would take the time to upvote this post so it can reach as most people as possible

**EVENT IS CASTLE WARS - WORLD 34**


Hey all

Unfortunately paramedicine is out of town this weekend so he won't be able to run any events for us tonight.

I've picked up the pieces last minute and thrown together a poll for what people want to do tonight.



* **[Castle Wars](http://www.runehq.com/oldschoolminigame/castle-wars)**
**Requirements:** None 

This game is a classic capture the flag game which adheres itself to all levels. It is also a safe minigame. Rewards are tickets which can be exchanged for decorative armour.





* **[The poll can be found here](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=518cf222e4b0df6bcbc7744d)**    We will meet on W45 at **[11pm GMT](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Reddit+Event&amp;iso=20130510T23&amp;p1=303&amp;ah=2)**


Any questions/problems reply on here

Regards

Zelden

""We haven't changed any reward distributions in treasure trails since OSRS came out. I think the Jmod in question may have quoted a misleading statistic...

The chance of a reward item being 3rd age platelegs is indeed less than 1/100000.
However
Then you get between 4 and 6 (inclusive) items at a time. So we're now looking at a much larger chance of getting something 3rd age in your reward chest.

Statistics isn't my thing

If that's not enough evidence to divert you away from the 1/100,000 players' adventurer logs.  The results are as follows:

30 days

3 third-age amulets; 

7 third-age coifs; 

5 third-age full helmets; 

4 third-age kiteshields; 

4 third-age mage hats; 

4 third-age platebodies; 

5 third-age platelegs; 

3 third-age range tops; 

3 third-age range legs; 

4 third-age robes;
