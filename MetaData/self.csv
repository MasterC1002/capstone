BRILLIANT

An officer and a Brilliant man are both hospitalized after getting hit by a car Christmas night.

On Wednesday night, told Natalie Herbick  his side of the story.

  Starcher faced a judge Wednesday on charges connected to the investigation, James Coil, feared for their lives. 

""Christmas was a bad day that day. We were taking a walk to take a breather

Just after 10 p.m. on Christmas night

""He asked, 'What are you doing?' We said, 'Nothing,'"" Starcher said.
""He said, 'I'm not sure if I should give you that. Why do you want it?' And that's when he jumped out of the car.""

Starcher said the officer started swearing and got in their faces.

Wells Township police said OfficerJ.J. Kamerer only had intentions of lending a helping hand but sensed confrontation and merely wanted identification. Police said Coil threw a prescription bottle at the officer's face.

""He didn't throw the pill bottle at him

At that point

""Jimmy started to mouth off. I mouthed off a little

Police said Kamerer chased the men on Third Street in Brilliant. Starcher said he never ran

""I heard the officer running into the road screaming
""And then all of a sudden the car stopped and the officer flies across the road

Coil is in critical condition in a Pittsburgh hospital. Starcher said neither of them wanted to start any problems

""He's never done anything to anyone

Starcher pleaded no contest in court and was found guilty of obstructing official business and failure to disclose one's personal information. He is set to be sentenced on Jan. 11.

Officer Kamerer is in Wheeling Hospital with a serious leg injury.  NEWS9 will make sure his side of the story is heard once he is ready to speak.

summary- Google: the elan school (this will basically open Pandora's box) 

This place only still exist because so many people believe that it doesn't or that it can't. I believe that the internet is our #1 tool for exposing these horrid blind spots for what they are. Help me Reddit! 

I was sent to a place called The Elan School in 1998 and I was only 16. The scary thing is that Elan is still open, or who swore at their parents. Of course there were also real criminals there, but they did not make up the majority.

The ""school"" accepted anyone and then held them as long as they possibly could depending on the age of the child. If you were sent at 14 (many were) you may have been looking at 3-4 years. This is because The Elan School collects $50, school, or parents. And, of course, money was the only motivation of the staff and directors. These were the people in charge of your ""progress"" in the program.

I could write for hours about it

*   We were forced to participate in staff-organized fight clubs

*   Children who tried to rebel or be free-thinking were thrown into an isolation room where they had to stay for months at a time

*   We were all forced to perform in a ritual called a ""General Meeting"" where the entire house (60 or more boys and girls) screamed at one child who stood behind a broomstick. Many times they were forcibly held up by two other students so they would have to accept the punishment.

*   Education was considered a right, no projects. Ex: math class consisted of grabbing a math book and handing the teacher at least one page of work.

*   The other 12 hours of the day consisted of constant conditioning and brainwashing. In the beginning you obviously rejected it, interact, or communicate in any way with other Non-Strengths. It took a minimum of 6 months to earn the title of ""Strength"". It took some kids years to earn ""Strength"". Some kids never did.

*   Elan made money based on the amount of time it took for you to graduate ""the program"". You had to have a minimum of 7 promotions before you were a candidate for ""graduation"". Each promotion took a minimum of 3 months, I remember one dude was 23.

*   Your level of high-school had no reflection whatsoever on your ability to leave Elan. I was forced to do my senior year of high school twice
 
*   The staff members were primarily former students who were hired by Elan after graduating from the program. Many arrived in BMW's and clearly made 6 figure incomes. None of them had degree's in psychology, etc... Many of them never went to college at all.

*   All outgoing letters to parents were screened

*   We were not allowed to write or receive letters until we earned the right (this could take 8 months or more). When someone found out where I was and wrote me

I feel like I am beginning to write too much and I do not want to overwhelm anyone who made it this far. Because most of the bullet points honestly require further explanation to give the full impact of what Elan truly was.

The most important thing that anyone can do is to be aware of this place and make sure that nobody you know ever gets sent there for any reason. If you are a parent then do not send your child there. If you know someone who is there now then beg the parents to do more research.

The amount of suicides and tragic deaths of former Elan students is reason enough to take this post seriously.

1330181690.0,q5guh,An unknown man died. This is all I can give him.,xebo,2563,1017,159,"This probably won't be seen

I once knew a great man. His name was Phil Pilalus. He used to be a millionaire during the ""dot com"" explosion in silicon valley. Among being a tremendously accomplished entrepreneur

He didn't only advocate human rights, or a ward of the state, Phil Pilalus pioneered the fight for your rights. He drafted, by hand, many documents that guarantee your safety.

The ""dot com"" bubble burst

Two years ago I moved out to Mountain View, and I couldn't afford a car let alone health coverage. Phil decided that I could use some help, so he rented me a room. 

We spent the next 6 months getting to know each other. Phil and I were both somewhat off the ""beaten path"". Neither of us had medical coverage, Phil would often express how it was hard for him to get a job now a days, since the business world didn't have need for an aging salesman. He would talk about how costly medical coverage is, and how he would have to contact the drug manufacturers directly to be supplied with his medication. He would talk about how sometimes he would meet doctors at the events he volunteered for, and they would give him the occasional free checkup. More than anything, Phil would talk about how he wasn't beaten yet. He was going to make his comeback. He would say that it was only a matter of time until he would be a millionaire again, and I completely believed him.

One night I woke up to a gentle tapping on my wall at about 3:00 am. I trace it back to Phil's room. I open his door, and I rush to the living room to do so. The operator tells me that an ambulance is on its way as I jog back into Phil's room. When I enter, I see Phil unconscious, collapsed face up on his bed. He's not breathing. The operator walks me through the CPR process until the EMT's arrive. 4 hours later, they wheeled him out in a body bag. 

Phil Pilalus died that night because of heart complications that arose from mixing his medications improperly. He never got to make his comeback. He had accomplished so much

I'm sorry if this wasn't the most eloquent way of telling this story. Phil Pilalus deserves so much more than this. It's all I can give him. I'm so sorry Phil.

My chief complaint is with the United States Olympic Committee.  It does not take adequate care of its athletes when compared to most other first-world nations.  The sad irony is that the USOC is one of the richest national Olympic Committees in the world

In total, the organizations that oversee individual sports, only 3% of funds go directly toward supporting athletes.  (As 501 non-profits, the USOC and NGBs must have publicly available 990 IRS forms, so more recent figures are out there if someone wants to dig up.  ([Read more about financial side of Olympic Endeavors](http://usatelitetrack.org/dhac/?page_id=29)) 

Those numbers are abysmal.  Imagine another NGO or a charity that only directed 3%-10% of its funds toward direct aid.  (For reference the American Institute for Philanthropy sets 60% as a minimum and 75% as the preferred amount for direct support.)  At best the USOC would be lampooned as a joke in the industry

And yet the USOC gets away with it because it is the only officially sanctioned institution (other than individual athletes and their funds

They further justify their dearth of support for athletes by claiming that athletes receive adequate financial aid from private enterprises and through lucrative endorsement contracts.  That’s a wild fantasy for most athletes.  For every millionaire Shaun White or Lindsey Vonn, their Olympic Committee would provide.)  That brings up the challenge of trying to convince a health insurance company to provide you with coverage.  And even if you’re a paragon of health and phsyical vigor, that’s not an easy sell when you’re engaged in activities such as ski jumping, snowboarding, or sliding down a chute of serpentine ice at over 70mph/112kph, and where [serious injury is always a risk](http://www.sportsnet.ca/magazine/2012/05/04/sportsnet_magazine_bobsled_accident_zwelling/). Most insurance companies view that as a terrible business proposition, and will find any way to either deny coverage or charge a ridiculous premium.  

As a result of this lack of USOC support, but I’ve yet to convince anyone that it’s a worthwhile cause (and with all the sick, starving, and less fortunate people in the world who could be better served by charitable donations, I completely understand the reticence to support an Olympic Development Athlete).  That financial gap is where the USOC should really be stepping up to help support its athletes, but it doesn’t.  I’m seriously thinking about taking to the streets in my spare time and begging for cash.  

And yet the USOC rakes in well over $100 million a year.  In non-Olympic years, and corporate sponsorship will likely bring in another $60-80 million.  And they’re still asking individual viewers through NBC commercials and web campaigns to donate to the USOC on top of that.   

So where is all that money going?  

Not towards athlete performance bonuses apparently: a US athlete who brings home the gold medal in his or her event will receive just $25,000 from their Olympic committee.  Japan also gave fourfold what a US athlete earned.  China awarded their gold medal athletes $131,000, Uzbekistan &amp; Italy ~$200,000, Kazakhstan $250,000,000,000,800

Rather, and included COO &amp; former CEO salaries of over $600,000 per year.   In 2008, 8 USOC officials made more than $300,000 per year, and at least 20 made over $200,000 per year.  Of the remaining ~40%, USA Track &amp; Field, only ~3% goes directly toward athlete support.  That’s a whole lot of money getting whittled away through administrative and bureaucratic inefficiencies

**TL;DR: Please do not donate to the US Olympic Committee; they’re one of the richest Olympic Committees in the world

From looking, so I thought ""Oh maybe he's putting stuff in the letterbox"".

I stayed watching him out of curiosity and then when he crossed the alley between my neighbour and their neighbour, so he slowly got in, quietly closed the door, turned the interior light on and started looking about.

Now my first instinct here wasn't great. Instead of calling the police, after about 30 seconds, I went to wake up my dad thinking we could go out and stop him/ward him off, which we've done once in the past when our neighbour was getting burgled and they called us for help while she waited for police. It was then I got the much more appropriate advice to actually phone the police. 

So I phoned them, lock your car, it's not that hard) and he started to search that one. Now because it was a dead night, while I was still on the phone to the operator describing what I could see, over the next 20 seconds 4 police cars turned up. No sirens or lights, with 2 approaching from each end of the road. The guy noticed and tried to leg it into a garden, but let's be real

I guess these fucking criminals are dumb, but his PC was still there, which was mildly comforting.

After a quick debate of whether to tell my housemate or the cops first, I decided to call my housemate first to tell him about it and figure out what we're going to do.  After explaining what happened and telling him we need to change locks since someone has my keys, he said he had $500 cash in an envelope on his desk that he was going to send home, and wanted me to check it out.  So I go up and find the envelope on his desk, but it’s empty.  I tell him that and I’m still trying to get my head on straight, and about 30 seconds later I saw this on his desk under the envelope.

1337910659.0,u3s38,I had to attend a Unemployment Seminar today to keep my unemployment benefits. I really need to vent due to the advice given. It was horrible.,Athrowawayfortoday,1765,463,363,"The first thing I need to vent about is the fact that the State Worker told me that the reason I needed to attend the seminar was because my resume indicated I was in a ""dying field"".  

I have an electronics degree, pneumatics, hydraulics, I can code in multiple programming languages, I can write ladder logic code, I work with PLCs and have worked with the latest automated equipment and the oldest equipment.  Relay logic and good old troubleshooting is part of my knowledge. Not to mention the mechanical knowledge I have. The last job I held was with a green, recycling company on machines that required field repair of the electronics inside machines inside retail environments.  How is this a ""dying field?"".  

The first woman spoke.  She didn't really speak, I am pretty sure that the older crowd in the room was quite aware of this.  I would say the youngest person in the room was 30.

The second woman started talking. For some reason she was going on and on about her skydiving hobby.  *In a room full of people in danger of losing their homes and not sure how they're going to keep their electricity on, especially with fuel costs.  Was this really necessary?  You could see everyone in the room just sitting in awe as this woman continued on about personal skydiving stories in different locations throughout the United States.

She then told us that our best option was to join the military.  She told us this after a woman told her that she worked for the same company for 30+ years and really only had one skill.  The woman that told her this was in her 50's. Now I am not against joining the military. Was this really the best advice she could give us?  She then went on to tell us about how her daughter was joining the military and babbled about skydiving some more.

She then told a room full of people how hard she has it because she has to drive 45 minutes to work.  *She's working for a state agency

She then bragged about how great our state's unemployment site is.  This is the site that crashes randomly

What made the whole situation worse, she didn't know to click the [X] and make it go away.  She mumbled and panicked and just left it there.  It kept minimizing her presentation, so she finally left in minimized and went on with the presentation.

Finally a third woman came up to speak to us about how to interview. She went on to tell us that we should turn down jobs if we don't think we're a right fit. *If you openly admit to turning down a job, and your upset because you haven't received a raise in two years?

Finally it came to the point where we were allowed to ask questions.  Now another reason I am confused about why I was selected is because I have a full job services program available to me through the school I attended. I talk to a job counselor two or three times a week at my school.

I decided to ask the same questions that I asked the job counselor at school to see what the State Worker's response would be.  *All three questions were answered with ""I don't know, you'll have to ask someone else"".  (The three questions would reveal my identity, i don't feel safe doing that, I don't want to lose my benefits)  The three questions I asked were quickly and easily answered by my school job counselor, I am already taking action to fix the situation. I just wanted to hear their responses.  *There were none.*

Finally, I forgot to print it out before I left, so I quickly jotted down some of the jobs I remember sending a resume to.

I said to the woman ""I input this information every week when i file online

I then explained that a lot of the jobs I send a resume to are through a jobsearch site that I have an account with

She snapped at me and told me I was wrong

I chatted with the second woman who talked for a few minutes. She asked how old I was, since I work in a STEM field. She replied with ""Oh, college isn't all it's cracked up to be.""  *Really?* ever try to advance in a technology/engineering field *without* a college degree?  I have, the degree made all the difference in the world, it's just an associates, I can only imagine a bachelors would help even more. My salary increased substantially with just my associates.

She then told me that unemployment has a budget for the number of people that can attend this course and get help, my attire, interviewing and use better equipment than what is available here if necessary.  I can also sit in on any of the courses I took just as a refresher. *Why have you wasted a space on making me attend this?* There are probably people who need this resource more than me. She basically GIGGLED and shrugged her shoulders at me and said ""You're in a dying field!"".  **Electronics, engineering and technology is not a dying field**

The youngest person in the room was right around 30 in my opinion, unfortunately it would probably result in the termination of my benefits.

But she still ended up in pain and sore and unable to climb stairs. So we pulled out the fold-up couch in the living room and set it up for her to recuperate there for a few days.

I go to the drug store to attend to all of these problems. While I'm waiting for the pain pills to be made ready I collect stuff to meet my other needs. And hey

The pharmacist doesn't smile. In fact she flashes me a look that could have killed a small child. I'm bewildered. I pay for everything and leave. 

Only when I get home do I realize what I had placed on the pharmacy counter while collecting the drowsy-making pills:

This eventually led to the signing of the contract and the continued operation of the couple's cart on campus.

When I got to his house, I'd take a moment and relax. 

I started noticing a lot of pictures of him and his wife setup around the sofa. Then I noticed a handmade wall of photos of him and his wife. Next to the VCR was a stack of old videos that were stacked and ready to be watched. 

Then I realized that I hadn't seen his wife. 

He never outright told me

After a couple hours of work, the button was fixed better than he said it ever was (it has a nice snap to it now). I mentioned to him that he was my first client and we laughed about him and his wife trying to get my attention, etc, etc.

I decide to go home from visiting my friends. On the way home, yet I had never noticed this one. I prefer Icehouses because I can take my own bottle of whiskey inside and just buy cokes all night. I drive right by it the first time and figure what the hell, turn around, and park at this bar. 

I grab the bottle from my backseat, take my seat near the pool table, order a coke &amp; cup of ice, and pour up.

I drop a few quarters in the pool table and start playing against myself. I don't feel out of place or anything, take aim, pull the stick back, and feel two soft hands cover my eyes from behind.

I didn't even have to guess. I remembered her smell from 4 years ago, so we mutually agreed to discontinue our relationship. As time went on, I realized that our random texts &amp; calls were growing fewer and further between. I hadn't seen her since June 2008, hadn't heard her voice since January 2010, and I hadn't received any form of a message from her since September 2010. Yet there she was, standing behind me, trying to trick me as if I wouldn't instantly recognize her.

I put my hands on hers (again, and I reacquainted with her eyes for the first time in 4 1/2 years. The same hazel sparkle I fell in love with. I pulled her in for a hug. Her hands reached into my unzipped jacket and her arms wrapped tightly around my torso. The hug was about 3 seconds, felt like 15 minutes, and I wanted it to last all night. 

The small talk quickly evolved into catching up each other on our lives for the last 3 years. I learned that we had both graduated on the same day (from different universities) last week, and continued to ask what she was doing in a shack like this place.

She turns and points to a table of 3 people- 2 girls

""I'm here with my two friends &lt;girl&gt; and &lt;girl&gt;

The second the B sound uttered from her lips

Before I can even finish saying ""Congrats on the job"" and take my bottle elsewhere

""I'm joking! That's &lt;girl&gt;s boyfriend. Come drink with us?

I play it modest

""Sure

I proceed to sink my last 4 shots, and continue drinking and laughing with the group. 

About an hour goes by

Showtime. Me and Brooke

It wasn't the alcohol (yet), sweaty-palmed self that blurted ""It's really good to see you.""

She agrees. ""I'm so glad! What are the odds?""

Long pause of about 5 seconds

My response, and fill it with a family the second I can afford it. With as much nonsense that can fit between all of that""


Brooke: I knew you would never change.

Me: Is that a bad thing?

Brooke: Nope

Her friends return from smoking. I walk to the bar for another coke and a beer for her.

Bartender: Is that your lady?

Me: No sir

Even though he was just making small talk, why not at least mention it?

I return to the table

11pm rolls around and we're the only ones left in the bar. We spare the staff, and Brooke points out how glad she is that she didn't drive. I mention that I am not drunk, just a bit tipsy, and I'll probably sit in my truck and sober up for about a half hour. 

She turns to her friends, ""Can you take me to my parents house?""

Me: Right now?

Brooke: Whenever. I just don't want to leave you alone and I'm not really ready to go home.

Me: Sounds good *cue touchdown dance*

We part ways with her group, seat warmer, accompanied with my ""leaving the bar"" playlist. Yeah I have one of those, leave me alone.

Me: You don't have to wait around. I can run you home.

Her: No really

She puts on another smile

I went for it. I moved my hand over to hers. She closed her eyes and smiled again. With her eyes still closed she says ""Your hand is warm""

I pick her hand up, she leans in, we touch foreheads.

Brooke: What are you thinking?

Me: I am thinking that I am pretty lucky running into you tonight.

Her(quietly): Me too.

Me: Whatever you want.

Her: Let's get me home. I want to make sure this isn't the alcohol.

I get on the road, and release.

Her: Tonight was fun

Me: Yes it was. Can I have one more of those?

Smartest thing I've said all night. She leans in, I went for the bra. Oops.

We snapped out of it, and decided to resume another night. Just to double check that it wasn't the alcohol.

She leaned over one last time

Me: Goodnight.

The year-long warranty on a laptop my husband purchased was expiring, which my husband explained, and was patched through to a tech. 

The tech politely asked husband to remove the battery, the tech trying to extract serial numbers and the like, and my husband asserting that all the tech needed was already on his computer screen. 

**Husband:** I just need a new battery. That's it. If you could just send a new one....

**Tech:** We must remove the battery first. 

**Husband:** Look

**Tech:** You cannot remove the battery? Why can't you remove the battery? 

{Silence}

**Husband**: I can't because {dramatic pause} *I have no fingers.*

{Dramatic silence}

**Tech:** Sir

**Husband:** That's right

**Tech:** Oh

{On hold}

I've never been able to see out of my left eye, but that's about it. 19 months ago, I had a corneal transplant (awesome picture of my eye at that point here: http://imgur.com/WEBZM) to give me a dead person's eye (well, cornea).

Today, or at least until they degrade). The vision will make final improvements over the next few weeks, but immediately after taking them out and putting on some glasses - I can see! For the first time in my life, I have (mostly) clear vision out of my left eye. It's incredible, I rang my wife in tears because I actually saw what my surgeons face looked like properly for the first time (my ""good"" eye isn't great either, that's next). Can't wait to see my daughter tonight, she's almost 5 and I've never really seen her face clearly. It's hard to explain - for my entire life, but now things have defined edges. It's mind-blowing and weird - everything looks so strange because I'm seeing in 3D for the first time ever. This is what depth-perception looks like!

Reddit is probably the most helpful platform to me when it comes to scrutinizing popular news items and reports because of the amount of debate and digging that often goes on in the comments. 

I felt we could steer the attention Kony 2012 got more towards charities that have actually been proven to be effective and efficient rather than condition people to not give a fuck due to the backlash. I did a lot of research and picked Save The Children's work in the Horn of Africa for my experiment. 

To set it up, they're letting me beta-test a new feature that lets me make a fundraiser for which anyone else can create sub-fundraisers that get tracked on a leaderboard and can easily be linked and embedded etc. I'm in no way affiliated with them but I wanna give them props for this because this is the kind of social media trend that I can actually get behind. 

Since this is an experiment to raise awareness, all donations are being matched so I need to reach $500K to get one million donated to Save The Children's work in the Horn of Africa). I don't have any expectations though and since I'm a long time redditor and have seen all the cool things the community has achieved, I thought I'd share it with you guys.

First of all, thanks a lot.  I don’t belive for one second that this divorce is anything other than your last option.  I certainly remember coming to the conclusion that my marriage had exceeded the point of no return.  I’m still pissed at the bastards who thought they understood the situation better than I did.  Don’t listen to them.  It’s just noise. They don’t know or understand what you do.

Amidst all the legal doings, but one is longer lasting and requires significantly less penicillin. 

I would also advise you to take the high road at every turn during the legal ranglings.  Years down the road you will remember whether or not you walked away with your dignity and your integrity in tact.  You won’t remember who got the most stuff.  It’s just stuff.  You have plenty of time to accumulate new stuff.  Both lawyers are going to want to wrestle in the gutter for every last nickel.  It’s not worth it. Just get it behind you. 

Go out and buy a 12 pack and rent the movie “War of the Roses.”  You will need the levity.  After the movie

There is a hole inside of you that feels like you’ve failed at something that was really important….something that you were determined to not fail at. Everyone, but that isn’t true either.  All that I can tell you for sure is that tomorrow will be just a little bit better than the day before was and that it does go away.  

The world is full of nasty bitter people who didn’t have the courage to step up and say “no. I can’t do this.  I can’t live this way.”  Most of them go onto the advanced course and raise nasty bitter children who repeat the cycle.  Give yourself a little bit of credit for making the sane decision to not be counted amongst them.  You can watch them every Saturday night on “COPS” if you like.  And who knows

Aside from the girls between here and Panama, people make jokes about being on the rebound, and it still happens all the damn time.  That’s trouble you don’t need.  There are a thousand switches in your head and in your heart that need to be reset before you will be of use to anyone else.  There is nothing wrong with enjoying being a single guy for a while.  Go to Vegas.  Better still, go to New Orleans.  It might be outside of your budget, but I saw some shit down in Rio that would make your brother blush.

I promise, or to talk through this, or anything else, I’m here.

1295540887.0,f5vh1,"I founded the “Anti-PayPal”, raised $9MM, and now want to help Redditors",wepay,1573,484, because anonymity doesn’t really make sense in this context.*
  
(If you don’t want the back-story

I founded [WePay.com](http://www.wepay.com) with a former college roommate in August 2008 – about a year after graduating from BC.  I was actually in law school at the time

The original idea was to build a website that made it really easy for “normal people” to collect money from friends, supporters, attendees, whoever.  The idea hasn’t really changed much since then. We added additional tools like the ability to create/sell tickets and accept donations, but the basic value proposition has stayed the same: giving people an easy way to collect money from a bunch of other people.  

It’s worth noting that when we first started the company

Even though we [raised money from the founder of PayPal]( http://www.businessinsider.com/max-levchin-is-pretty-excited-about-a-new-payments-startup-called-wepay-2010-4)
 
The Flux Foundation and a bunch of other people and organizations collecting donations [ended up turning to WePay](http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2010/08/13/paypal-freezes-out-other-groups-who-turn-wepay-updated) in protest (and in desperation).  And then people started comparing us to PayPal.

We were called the consumer-friendly or “community-oriented” version of PayPal. CNN actually referred to us as the [anti-PayPal.]( http://money.cnn.com/2010/10/12/technology/wepay/index.htm)
The comparison isn’t completely accurate because — as I said above — we are focused on helping everyday consumers collect money from people in their social circles, we are kinda like PayPal, but we love our customers, have great customer service, and try really hard not to freeze your accounts.

We took the PayPal/WePay contrast to the extreme when [we decided to drop 600 pounds of ice at PayPal’s annual developer conference](http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/26/wepay-ice-paypal/).  In the block of ice was $500 and the words: “PayPal freezes your accounts.”  The prank hit the front page of reddit for about 30 minutes. Best. 30 minutes. Ever.  

From the comments

I also noticed that whenever the Reddit community raises money for somebody in need
).

I’m really concerned with solving the: “you’re a scammer” problem. One of the cool things about [WePay](http://www.wepay.com) is that people can “join” your accounts (basically giving them view-only access to the account)

Yesterday,** intended to make it even easier. In your group account settings, you can enable the account so anybody can join, *without you having to invite them first.* The basic idea being that you can maintain full transparency, since everybody can see where the money is going. 

If the money isn't being allocated appropriately, you can monitor this. If the account balance ever exceeds one or two hundred dollars, and the money doesn't go to the right place, you can simply refuse to donate (and tell everybody else to do the same). 

I’m hoping that offering a PayPal alternative, without the BS that goes along with it.

Let us know what you think

The next day

&gt; haha i appreciate your proposal. I do not hate fat people. Where you from?

From here,500 miles between us, the best I could ever hope for would be to make a new friend online.

We got chatting on Skype and found that we really got on well together both through messages

About two or three weeks into speaking to each other

I then remembered that my Mum was going on holiday in May for a week meaning that my house would be empty and it just seemed like a perfect opportunity to get her over here with the only major cost on her part being the plane ticket

I went to meet her at the airport and waited at the arrival gates, she came through the doors.

A girl from 3, but not something that happens daily!

We gave each other a long hug. Something which we had been unable to do for the last two months via Skype. We then jumped in a cab and she laid her head on my lap to rest after her journey. It felt amazing being so close to her already.

Back at my house

For the next seven days

We both laughed a lot over the time she was here with me and we also both cried a lot when the time came for me to say goodbye to her at the airport a week later. It was really fucking hard. Saying goodbye to someone you've spent such a good time with and feel so comfortable with is one of the hardest things to do. Knowing that you can't just pick up the phone and arrange to meet them whenever is painful.

Returning home after saying goodbye to her

My hope is that we somehow manage to come up with the funds again for me to go to the US to visit her or for her to come here again as she makes my life feel so much happier when I'm around her. I wish I could have spent more time with her.

It is truly amazing to think that a single sentence on Reddit can change things in such a big way and I'm glad it did. The week I spent with her was one of the best of my life and though it was so painful saying goodbye to her

**Thoughts on reddit:**
    
“I came for the posts but stayed for the comments.”  That pretty much sums reddit up for me.
    
It should be obvious that I am a hardcore lurker and that that I don’t care about my karma.  I’ve never understood why someone would care.  If I could somehow spend them to woo women or purchase super powers
    
**On how reddit has changed:**
    
Six years ago it might take me an hour to get through the front page.  The front page turned over MUCH slower and the links had lots of depth.  I would click on a link, learning to paint, learning to play piano, crossfit and personal projects) and partly due to the content shift of reddit.  The demographics of reddit have changed too.  The average reddit user is much younger and I suspect I have less in common with them.  I love to learn new things.  It’s the greatest passion of my life.  
    
My browsing philosophy has been simple.  Look for gems (posts and comments) and upvote them.  Ignore reposts and everything else unless it is blatant spam. I didn't even know that the down vote was a different color until last year.  I have a rule of not going past the first 500 posts.  
    
It’s been a pleasure being part of the reddit community even as a lurker.   If they ever open a lurker Olympics

Without telling her about it, I can't possibly make her see how much.  It would probably freak her out anyhow.  So I will just write it instead.

I have endured a particular sort of hell.  I was abused by my mother, and I've had a lot of issues from all that.  I have had a strange and isolated life.  

My mother physically abused me, or someone else you love, someone who you just cannot stand to see hurt.  There is such an intense urgency to that, a desperate need to make it stop.  She was abusive but she was also my mother, she baked cookies and gave hugs, she would hold me.  She was both, and it took both to make hell complete.

I had a bedwetting problem.  She would come up those stairs and sometimes she would be understanding, and she would look so sad, and say that it hurt her so much for me to keep doing this, how she tried so hard to make things nice and I ruined everything, how I made the whole house smell.  She would beg me to stop.  I couldn't stop of course, but I would stand there in the darkness shivering and hating myself.  I was hurting her, and I wanted to stop so much.  

Then she would start getting angry, pinching.  Muttered, spitting threats, asking me ""do we need to cut it off?"", threatening me with scissors.  She would push my face into the pool of urine in the plastic sheet like training a dog.  

It got to the point where I didn't even resist.  I was so crushed with guilt and I hated myself, my arms limp.  It seemed right to do that to me, I didn't fight it.  On the few occasions I did struggle she would go insane and throw me around, broke my collarbone once when I was 5 and then threw me back in bed and told me to stop my caterwauling, didn't take me to the doctor till the next day.  

Being hit and thrown may break my bones but words can twist and break me.  She humiliated me, seeing the one girl there I liked kneeling and praying about my bedwetting.  I could never even look at her again.

My mother would beg me to stop and I could not stop.  You can tell me now it was not my fault but you can't go back to 1974 and tell my 5 year old self anything like that.  The shame was crushing

I started a ritual when I was 7 or so.  I would refuse to urinate, 3 feet away from relief, so that no one could see me struggle.  A weird little ritual, and I would become lost in stubborn rage, hating myself with a cold and furious intensity.  The ritual got more intense over time.  I liked it, I liked the rage and control.  I liked the pain.  It was my pain, I owned it.  

Even when I had kidney infections and bladder problems, even when the pain of holding it was like being stabbed, I refused to go.  It made no sense but I was not rational at that point.  In that weird ritual I found a sort of peace, some sense of control I suppose.  

I essentially took over the job of hating and abusing myself.  I eventually did more and worse to myself than my mother ever did.  At eight years old I had to go to the doctor with lacerations after I tried to cut off my penis.  And that was only the feeble beginning of The Ritual.  

She left home when I was 10.  She didn't even say goodbye or acknowledge she was leaving.  I knew why, who didn't bother with details like going to laundromats or talking to me.  I lived in filth and darkness, and withdrew from the world.  

I hated myself.  In particular I hated that part of me that loved my mother, that wanted to reach out and connect, the part that was human at all.  Whenever I felt that urge to come out and play I would strangle it, kill it, burn it.  

The ritual became more intense, puberty arrived.  Not very good timing.  A sudden need to be close to females, of all people.  That was not going to happen.  

Where some might feel a want and take steps to fulfill it, and in the ritual of needles, razors and flames I would find peace.  

I continued wetting the bed till I was about 17.  I continued the holding-it ritual till about 15 or so.  I was not always successful in this, reeking of urine, wetting my pants, never speaking a word.  Somehow I did not get elected homecoming king.  An oversight, I assume.  

I did not think about girls or fantasize at all, after barely attending at all before that.  I once noticed I had gone a couple of days without talking to anyone and started counting.  I got to 21 days in a row without a word, a nod, a wave, anything, at home or school.  A librarian said hello to me to break the streak.  I am sure I have broken that record many times over since then but haven't counted.

I grew older and moved out, I just thought I was a weird fuckup.  I could not stand to be in a place where I could not just leave, like at most jobs.  If I couldn't leave I would start to get panicky and make crazy decisions.  I had some success as a pizza delivery guy, where I got to leave every 20 minutes.  I developed a way of interacting with people, superficial joking around, never talking much.  I was invisible.  I referred to other people as TOWLOMS, or The Ones Who Live Outside My Skull.  

I made a fairly feeble but seemingly dramatic effort to kill myself at 26

I lived in shelters, which no therapist told me about.  I had to admit I loved her, loved my mother.  I had to feel that again.  I had to vomit up all that poison.  I did not want to.  

I was detached, desperately needed to be disconnected.  It was my only way, I had spent years of insane effort to be invulnerable and need no one.  But I had to admit that was all a lie, and that I was still that piss-soaked cringing little kid who wanted his mommy.  I had to stop hating him.  Someone had to take his hand and let it be OK, and no one on earth could do it but me.  

I am nearly 43 now and have come out of the darkness, rarely make eye contact, hardly ever physical contact.  I live in a sort of shelter/boardinghouse and work part time doing dishes.  I have still never been on a date or kissed or anything.  Not a lot of people go on their first date at 43, and besides being old I am fat, bald, mental, broke, teeth like a 12th century pirate

But I am also intelligent, thoughtful, gentle, funny, and apparently a good dancer.  More on that later.

In the past year or so I have been making an effort to open up a little

There is a girl at work.  Before you start getting excited, and it just isn't about that.  She is bubbly and random, cute and funny, she lights up the world.  I cannot manage to be depressed around her, and I am a world fucking champion at being depressed.  And she likes me.  She goes out of her way to talk to me, initiates chats with me on Facebook, she lights up when she sees me.  

She hugged me for heaven's sake.  She could not know it was the first time I had been hugged in just about 8 years.  For her it was just a casual friendly thing to do.  For me it was like a simple glass of water in the desert.  

Without meaning to, and she has never hinted at any such feelings.  I think of her as a friend, my very best friend. That is fine, and more than fine, it is glorious.  I love the friendzone, it is a spectacular place to be.  

I have enlisted her help in starting to date.  I have to get a car and normal place to live

She does not know and cannot know about me.  I could not tell her of the urine and the needles and the scissors and the degrading shame.  These things do not exist in her world, not to try to make up for the hell I have endured.  

A few days ago I was not doing well at all.  Depressed, can't risk being fired.  She came to see me at work on her day off, and just as we were all finishing up and getting ready to leave, she said something about dancing.  I said I didn't think I had ever done that.  She took my hand, and said we were going to dance right now.  A waitress there got a video of it on her phone.

I don't know where I go from here.  But though misery and hell

1284184167.0,dcejr,I am a Muslim teenager in America. This is what I think about 9/11.,Inquiry,1749,850,668,"I know this will probably be ignored by the Reddit masses but I hope if you read this it gives you a little insight into the American Muslim perspective.

 I feel like alot of people have been asking ""Where are the majority of Muslim voices? Why do they not speak up?"" So for you all (and a bit for myself)

A little bit of background: I am raised Muslim and have been going to mosques around the country (especially in the South) ever since I was a little kid. My father is very active in our local Muslim community and so from
 Personally

I was in fifth grade when the attacks happened. At the time, it really hit me how much my life had changed. Suddenly, every time my name was called out in class, I could hear snickers from the other students. Our mosque was vandalized multiple times and my dad even received death threats from our own neighbors. It seemed like my world was collapsing and, in my 13 year old head, there was nothing I wanted more than to be a ""normal white kid.""

As I grew older, Muslims who were born in America, we were still Americans. We still loved our country and our religion and, by God, we weren't going to give up either of them.


Today, blacks, and Catholics have all gone through (and are still going through) what Muslims feel like we're going through now. As a Muslim and as an American, I have one simple request: If you are Muslim in America, don't be scared. Be willing to go out and talk about what you believe and be the best American you can be. If you are not Muslim, don't be scared. Be willing to look at others, not as different, I promise

tl;dr: We're all people with our own stories and our own ways of life. If anything

I know that this does not need saying to the group of people that I am sending this note to, bear in mind that at this time in our life both Jane and I probably need and appreciate family and friends more than ever.

That is all for now. If you pray

Love

John.

Jane had told me this yesterday...and my last piece of advice to her was this - remember when this is signed - that it is done. Make you know what you are doing ......

I hope you know that I have never taken sides - I love you both - I think you are both wonderful people and amazing parents. I have always advocated following one's heart - 

this is a very difficult process for you both right now and you both need to go through and you will both come out fine and stronger ...

I wish you both all the very best and I hope god's you the serenity and the strength to move on and to forge ahead.

You will always be my friend John so please do not feel otherwise....I love ya very much and I know you are hurting and if there is anything that I can do to help please let me know.

Know that as a dear friend to Jane I will always be there to help her in life - to make her laugh and smile when she is down

I know that you will also be ok and if ya ever need to chat give me a buzz.....

all my love 

Jess.

I'm going to vent a little here

First, and that you would do just about anything you could for Jane. That you want her to be happy. But truthfully, I don't want to be your friend, and I don't want you in my life.  I think you are a hypocrite, definitely to me, but also to yourself.

Here's why...

You do have a big role in Jane's an my divorce. That's a fact.

Whether you realize it or not, she didn't first cheat on me with Ryan, she first cheated on me with you. And I'd say I agree with her. Whenever she decided that her bond and her relationship with you is more important to nurture and protect than that of her family (and I am her family), that was a huge step in our breakup.

Also

I do believe you think you are supportive of Jane regardless of what she wants, I think you two have been providing emotional validation to each other. There is a huge difference! Every text I have accidentally received from you (true, not many) has been incredibly negative about our marriage. The last one blew me away (something along the lines of ""ughh... the only chemistry that marriage counselor is going to find between you two is hate. I know... follow your heart"". I do understand that you may have been reacting to stuff she has told you, but I would NEVER, EVER validate for Karl (or anyone else) his behavior the way I think you have validated hers. I know (because Jane has told me) that you've also told her things about Ryan like ""awww... you really love him... you need to be with him!"". You now, if Jane had come back from Dr. Johnson's that day saying that she was going to go for it with that ass of a man, instead of trying to see if she could reconnect with me

Also
To start with
Anyway, always chasing it, never nurturing all that you have to the potential that is there. Instead, you make a decision, you commit to it, and you pour your heart into it. Yes, there is risk in that
You know, I'm glad I did. I've learned a lot about Jane, myself, and love. Everything stopped being about the outcome, but in the process, of figuring out what one can do for the other person on THEIR terms. I am confident that no matter what happens between Jane and me, I can and will find happiness... not because I know how to follow my heart, and discovered what unconditional love is all about.

You know, but I know about you and Dan. I've known for a very long time. In fact, Jane accidentally let me know that you were having an affair the day I figured out about her and Ryan (I told you, she's really sloppy). I know Jane passes messages to you from him, so that Karl doesn't find out, which totally blows my mind!!! Let me give you some unsolicited, but honest advice here:

Right now, as you probably will, since though you and Jane seem to waffle back and forth, I think that is what you want, do it as honestly and compassionately as you can (those two things are not exclusive of each other). If you have a divorce based on deceit, nurtured resentment, and escapism, the irony of everything is that to have the best chance of happiness with someone else

I don't know Dan. He might be a nice guy. He may even be a great guy. But I can tell you with certainty that he's got some serious issues. An emotionally healthy guy will be attracted to and pursue emotionally healthy relationships. Yours is truly all but that. If he were a guy worth keeping, he certainly wouldn't have gotten emotionally involved with you, and he would have broken things off with you a long time ago. I don't like telling you that, and you probably like hearing it even less... but it is the best, most sincere advice I can give. And believe me, it is much better advice than Jane's ""you need to get out... you need to get out... you need to get out""! It may be true that you need to get out, but how you do it is as important to the health of your future emotional relationships as whether or not you do.

Just so you know

As far as Jane and I are concerned, which makes me very sad. I feel that a lot of the issues she is trying to escape are not even related to our marriage, and that Ryan is a big fantasy of escapism. I am certain that she is going down a road that is self-destructive and that will not lead at all to happiness. But when this first started my question to her was ""What do you want?"", and let her know that I would respect whatever it is she wants and love her as best I can through that process. I made that commitment to her, and I am doing my best to bring my heart throughout all this. Because it is not about the outcome, its about the process.

Anyway, just stay out of my life from now on.

Sincerely

1308473902.0,i3hjk,My friend is an immigrant working on a cruise ship. This is his horror story.,soleombre,1096,272,268,"My best friend signed a contract to become a crewman on a cruise ship through an Eastern European agency, even though the pay for this job was lousy, and lose his very hard earned (and heavily borrowed) investment

Here is everything that he told me about his working conditions:

- We don't have proper drinking water. The shower/tap water is yellow at all times, they said I have to buy bottled water from outside, or from the crew bar.

- There's no appropriate drainage in the laundry room where I work. As a result, or notify the engine room people when the water levels get too high so they drain it manually. Bear in mind that the stench is so unbearable when we get flooded, and the dirty water is so toxic that it discolors and corrodes the floor - I can't even imagine what the effects from a prolonged exposure could be on a human being.

- I got ~~electrocuted~~ shocked from a malfunctioning extension cord at my work place and almost nothing was done. The laundry supervisor didn't even report the incident so I had to report it myself! I went to the doctor and all he did was check my pulse, and he said I'm having phantom pains... I got shocked on my left arm and this guy keeps telling me I have phantom pains! He also said that getting shocked with 220 volts of electric current is not dangerous... I'm not sure if this guy even has a medical degree. I'm pretty sure that everything above 50v of DC current can be lethal and this clown is claiming differently! This isn't the only problem I've had with this doctor. I kept telling him I have sleeping issues and he kept telling me to exercise and when I asked him to give me sleeping pills he gave me some pills and he told me to take a double dose. I asked him why, and if there are any side effects of the drug, but he got angry and refused to answer my questions. Another medical issue I developed is blood in my stool, although I am not quite sure what's the cause. Bear in mind that I was totally healthy before I got on this ship.

- The garbage is not collected properly. The garbage is dumped on a giant pile on one of the decks

- The crew personal rooms are lousy. We have very small cabins with no toilets, so we have to get it ourselves.

- The food choices for the crew are minimal, because I mostly eat vegetables and salads. On top of that, even the vegetables and fruits are not fresh many times – yellowed salads, overripe fruits, etc. Drinks such as juice, coffee, milk, etc are not always provided as well. Sometimes the food for the crew is kept heated for days on end

- The safety of the crew and the passengers is jeopardized due to faulty rescuing equipment. Part of the equipment is older than 20 years, because the confusion would be enormous which would cause precious time to be lost on tracking down life jackets. A lot of people will die I guarantee you this! There are 300 crewmen and around 700 guests on average. I just hope that nothing will happen.

- I have two alternating shifts. Day shift staring 6am-6pm and night shift 6pm-6am. During the day shift I am allowed to take very few breaks – one for breakfast 7am-7:30am, we work 12 hours per day, 7 days a week with no overtime, and no guaranteed free days – we have to ask for a special permission for a day off.

- And now the kicker. We get paid a monthly salary of $450, I would have to cover all the transportation costs for the trip back, but if I stay for 10 months or more the company covers the costs for my trip. Every month, the company withholds a specific amount of money from my salary, until they collect $900 for insurance, so they can cover the transportation costs in case I chose to cancel my contract and leave. The problem is that I do want to leave, but if I do, but they paid me only $250 because they held $200 for the insurance. Again

- Many people have tried to sue/report the company before but they have failed. Nobody can do anything to this company! The president of the company is a former coast guard director and has connections all over Miami and nothing can be done about these problems. The USPH and Coast Guard do not pass the inspections as they should. They do not check anything. When others tried to get a lawyer from those maritime advocate firms they could not even get on the ship! I am very vulnerable here. There are no security cameras anywhere on the ship! I fear that something may happen to me if I try to get help from outside! 

tl;dr: There's no way to put this in less words. Please don't downvote because of the length. This is not a troll post. If you do downvote

[edit] Here's a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/5kq7h.jpg) of the drainhole in the laundry room where he works.

[edit2] This was a difficult text for me to write. I am writing on behalf of one of my best friends, and I also had to translate large portions of it as well. If at any moment the text sounds like it's been written by someone who just finished a giant meal at a top notch restaurant, topped off with an expensive wine – the tone belongs to me, not my friend. Not that I can afford a top notch restaurant, but you get the point.

[edit3] Here's another [picture](http://i.imgur.com/fTmU8.jpg) from the laundry room.

Not sure how common they are around the rest of the world, but it was easy to see he was trying to remain cool and was sweating nervously and quietly taking their abuse. The elderly women finished their purchases and left

I stepped outside and they were still standing in front of the store

""Excuse me

Two of the elderly women actually looked somewhat shocked that I said anything

""I would have expected more of you to mind your own business punk. It's none of your business what I say and when. You have no right to speak to me in that manner

I never stopped to continue this conversation,

""Ma'am, nor would I have insulted or even discussed his sexual orientation. As I said, for an adult you have a lot of growing up to do, now get the fuck away from me.""

At this point she started to call me a series of expletives. I did lose my cool a little bit and called her a bitter old hag as I rolled down my windows (my A/C is broken in my car), even if it was outside of the store and not inside. My intent was never to embarrass anyone, just to point out their actions and recommend that they apologize.

I was happy of my actions,

""They were right

I tried to argue that I thought it was the right thing to do to defend any person in that situation

So you know what? Fuck that. I am proud of myself. Maybe it was none of my business. Maybe I could have even handled the situation a little bit better, I didn't just let it go like it it's acceptable.

A week ago, Xbox 360, modded 360, and my desktop computer with my 24"" monitors, and a ton of other stuff. Most of the stuff was just material belongings and, although it sucked, completely replaceable. EXCEPT MY COMPUTER. All the documents I ever wrote in college, all my research, I immediately dusted off the good ol' Pentium 3 from the closet and started hitting refresh. I checked LogMeIn.com every 10 minutes for 4 days. I set my alarm to go off in the middle of the night just to minimize the time elapsed between checks. Then 4 days after my computer was stolen

My computer turned on. My baby was online! But who had stolen her from me? I waited until 3 AM to strike. I logged on to find my worst nightmare. An idle MySpace window. I cringe at the thought. I logged the ip address and the rest of ipconfig which is exactly when I ran out of ideas. I'm an idiot. I had 4 days to figure out a perfect plan of action, and free software recommendations. I dropped a stealth key logger onto it, installed Prey, and waited for the magic to happen. I also managed to log into the router and nab their SSID and BSSID for their wireless network, which would ultimately lead me to *my precious*. For 2 days, I collected email addresses, names, and sifted through keylogs until I was blue in the face.

Once I finally had compiled an ABSURDLY long list of possible addresses, and a network stumbler, I trudged all over the shittiest parts of town, looking to get a hit of the wireless network name and MAC address that I recorded from the stolen computer. After much driving, using peoplefinders.com, sifting through keylogs, and banging my head against the wall

I turned it into the cops, searched the house, and confiscated my computer. Not only that, but after they took pictures for evidence, I could have it back tomorrow! Also, the IT guy at the police station 100% called me out this morning because he had been following the thread on reddit. I guess you never know who is actually reading.

Then the man started shoving butter in his pockets.

So he turns around and starts trying to argue the price with me

I returned his stare until I realized that I was literally in a staring contest with a grown man and I started laughing and said ""You need to leave

But hiding behind someone else's face is her problem. What's our problem is that she is telling gullible people that they should drink something which could very well hurt their bodies. Linkdump of all information I could find on Hydrogen Peroxide:

There's evidence of carcinogenicity of hydrogen peroxide to mice administered high concentrations in their drinking water: http://u.nu/46sud

Results suggest that bone-loss in estrogen deficiency is caused by hydrogne peroxide http://u.nu/8urud

The ACGIH has classified hydrogen peroxide as an animal carcinogen: http://u.nu/4hrud

Tumor promotion in rat liver cells: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10190566

Hydrogen Peroxide Stimulates Proliferation and Migration of Human Prostate Cancer Cells: http://u.nu/7drud

Vitamin C prevents cancer by BLOCKING hydrogen peroxide: http://u.nu/5crud

The main factor in cigarette smoke that causes cancer is called hydrogen peroxide: http://www.physorg.com/news123408747.html

http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/541868 July 28

Adults are already getting seriously harmed by accidentally ingesting this crap: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2658134/ Imagine what happens to children exposed to this.

In other words

But it gets worse. She(?) is squeezing people dry with this bullcrap. On her site she asks $180 for a gallon of 35% hydrogen peroxide. I can buy 50 gallon of 35% hydrogen peroxide for only $399 here: http://www.groworganic.com/item_PSA860_Hydrogen_Peroxide__35_Food_Grade.htmlThat's 8 dollar a gallon. A little cheaper than $180 frigging dollar for one gallon. And that's her cheapest offer. A quarter gallon is 100 dollar. But in her defense, it's 30 bucks. 30 bucks to explain to you how to dilute a carcinogen and drink it.

August 28th

I first took notice of you in Chemistry

However, we had an almost identical view on life, except for religion. We became best friends. After only two weeks of meeting you, I knew I was in love.

We spent every day together. We went to prom together. I remember everyone saying ""Them two are going to get married one day"". We were both infatuated with love; but terrified. When we graduated

We couldn't let go of each other. We held hands and kissed everywhere. I remember it as if it just happened today. Your car, the park. Anywhere and everywhere we went, which was a lot of places because we were with each other every single day.

I never had a girl as beautiful as you, I just woke up. Come over in a half an hour, I have to take a shower first, then we'll go to school and hang out all day afterwords"". I remember those phone calls, and that voice, to the tee.

I still smile when I remember coming home to your parent's house that one morning at 6am. Your cars brakes went out so we ""borrowed"" your dad's car to go party one night. Your dad was getting ready for work

I remember when you went off to college 300 miles away

I was with Ashley at the time, but that's what happened and there's nothing I can do about it now.

Ashley cheated on me when I was in boot camp

I fell in love all over again (as if it ever left). We pulled it together and dealt with the long distance, mix cd's, bumper stickers, pictures and NES cartridges (haha!). That summer, things were better than ever. I came home almost every weekend. You came to North Carolina on the weekends I didn't. I wouldn't even tell friends or family I was coming, because the only person I wanted to spend the short time I had at home was with you.

We would always joke how we were ""engaged to be engaged"". All of your friends were mad at you because they didn't get to see you as much as I did. All of my friends didn't even know I was in town. We were perfect

I remember you would come over to my Mom's house and we would just play video games all day. You would always try to get a higher score than me in Counter-Strike, and miss your call on purpose. Again; regret.

I had always thought I knew what ""love"" was until I met you,000 miles apart for 9 months during my first deployment to Iraq. Torn from me abruptly, I went completely insane. Like cheesy love movie insane.

It was early November. I never tell the full story to anyone, we hung out at your apartment all day, then we took off for a night out in town. We went bar hopping in Franklin, they let me drink underage with my Military ID. I believe 5 of your friends were there as well, but it might have been 6.

We left at close. We were driving home. I had too much and I couldn't drive for you, and smacked into the driver's side door. I was horrified. Ironically, this drunk driver could have saved your life.

You were in pain, and there was nothing they can do. You said the doctor's are giving you three weeks to live. You wished me the best, said I love you, and hung up. I choked up. I was in tears. I couldn't even call back, I couldn't even hear the message again. I wanted to be dreaming. I wanted this to not be real. I couldn't even call you back, I was speechless. I deleted the message, but I wish I could hear your voice one more time.

I called back three days later. For three days, but that's no excuse. I got to talk to you and come see you a few more times. I will never forget our last conversation; our last words to each other. Why did I wait three days to come see you? That's three more days I could have had with you. Again; regret.

You passed away the morning of the 4th of December, and it sucks.

Your funeral was hard. I couldn't stay the whole time. I left with your friend Christina. She dropped me off at home

Usually guys keep things like this bottled inside of them

I'm moving on now, and I hate it. I've moved on, I just wish I didn't have to. What are the chances of someone finding ""the one"" twice in a single, short lifetime?

But they're so different. I don't fill with pride when I make them laugh

I wish we could cross paths again, you're somewhere looking down on me telling me to move on. Although I'm an Atheist and you've always hated that, even though you couldn't argue back. If your heaven does exist and I was wrong, you're probably laying down up there with your grandmother, who passed away only four months before you did. But not too close, because you have restless leg syndrome and need your space. I always tried to respect that, and I'm sure she does too.

But it's 1:54AM and I'm punching out this rambling text, it feels like life is such a chore... but it used to be our playground. I love you Jackie, I hope you're resting in peace. It just sucks that I don't sleep well anymore.

EDIT: Thank you all for the replies! It means a lot. And for those who think I'm a troll

As a side note for the people saying I am a great writer - thank you. I've been working on a novel for quite some time..but it's going to take longer than Brian's (from Family Guy) to complete.

Another bystander came to us and took his arm and they started walking in the direction of the police station. The old man turned around and thanked me.

I killed with it.  Dad would have loved it.  I hope you all do too.

---------------

When you’re a child

As you get older

Then

September 13th was that moment for me. 

 

My dad was the greatest man I’ve ever met.  I would frequently hear people who knew him tell me “You are just like your father”.  I would only be able to muster out something about how I was far more handsome than him

We would argue all the time about politics.  His crazy ultra-right wing lock up the borders and give guns to invalids talk against my rhythm-nation common man Marxist rants.  We would battle for hours, either we would realize that we were both basically arguing the same point, or my mom would come in and scream at us both to shut up.

But, besides this breathtaking visage, it was our love for making people laugh.  Thanksgiving dinner was a time to get everyone together and doing the other thing we both truly loved…  making fun of my mom.  Whether it was the smoke alarm signaling that whatever was in the oven was ready, or trying to have her remember a joke or read something aloud.  We had a blast with it.  I hope all of you will pick up where my dad and I left off and ask my mom to tell a joke or read anything aloud.  And don't feel too bad.  You can tease her all you want, she won't remember anyways.

I'm not sure exactly when it happened, so it's only fitting that I attempt to make you all laugh uncomfortably.  If any of these really do make you feel uncomfortable, just know that my dad would think they are funny.

So here I am... doing exactly what my father would have been proud of me for:  Milking this bereavement time for all that it’s worth! 

I'm not sure exactly what my dad died from.  Something called a myocardial infarction, he didn't have opinions anymore.  Actually, now that I think of it, this may have just been his way out of getting Social Security. 

We always joked that I'd be changing his diapers when he’s old.  I'd say ""I'll have people for that by then"".  Turns out I won't have to do that indignity for my parents.  That means you too mom.  If anyone knows a good nursing home

*Pats stomach*  I grew this gut just for this occasion.  That's just like normal...  Everyone laughs at that joke but my dad.  Only kidding...  of course my dad went to the gym steadfastly

He was also right in the middle of refinishing the cabinets in the kitchen.  I guess he REALLY didn’t want to have to finish those.  We will add this to the list of unfinished projects.

I probably could have been a really great rockstar.  But my picture perfect upbringing from loving parents ruined all of that.  I couldn't get any rage from anywhere!  What could I possibly be mad at?  Scream about my mom and dad still chasing each other around like schoolkids?  All that gross kissing and hugging?  Or their hilarious little fights where they weren't talking to each other? 

Here's some things that I've always wanted to say in front of my Dad but never could:
Ronald Reagan wasn't that great.  
Sarah Palin is an idiot.
There's probably some rap music that you'd like. 
The warranty plan is almost never worth it.
You won't ever need that receipt.  
You don't need that manual.  
You'll never send in that warranty card.  
The neighborhood kids are not stealing your internet. 

All bourbon tastes the same to me.  I always thought you were faking it when you could taste the difference.

A law banning giving infants loaded guns is not a ""Slippery slope"".

I never really liked watching football

Tuesday

Actual things that happened to me in school

by RJ 

**Kindergarten** - A waterbug popped up through the sink drain. It was really scary looking and everyone crowded around to look at it. Suddenly

Lesson: Bug = good. 

**1st grade** - Mr. Brescher the gym teacher had us line up one day because we had to go to the nurse. I asked him why and he said ""to get a big shot with a needle thiiiis big"" and demonstrated how long the needle was. I got scared. Not because i was scared of shots, and he said ""Oh no, you're definately gonna get a needle"". I cried more. 

Lesson: Crying 6 year old = prime chance to fuck with someone's head. 

**1st grade two** - Mr. Mcnelly had a table set up on parent-teacher night with instruments on it. Random kids were playing with the instruments. When I went to pick up the maracas, and at the end of their conversation Mr. Mcnelly said ""Why dont you show us how to play the maracas, rj."" I took them, and shook them once, before he snatched them away again. 

Lesson: I'm not allowed to play maracas. Ever. 

**2nd grade** - I was at the urinal peeing, like RJ did at cub scouts!"" (Yes, I used to pee in the drain in the bathroom floor at cub scouts). *I* got detention for my friend pissing on my leg, because I ""set a bad example"".

Lesson: At age 7

**2nd grade two** - I had just learned the word ""lesbian"" and I thought it was funny, I triumphantly yelled out ""LESBIAN!"". the teacher sent me to the principal, who gave me detention for disturbing classes by yelling ""made up words"". 

Lesson: Lesbian is a made up word. 

**3rd grade** - Drew, and then we'd swear it was their own doing because, after all, they were *suicide men*. One girl told on us, and then the teacher asked if we thought that suicide was funny. We said yes, and she said ""Good, you were honest. Don't do it again"" and we didn't get in trouble. 

Lesson: joking about suicide at a young age is okay

**3rd grade two** - In math class

Lesson: They have a TV in the white house. 

**4th grade** - Every thursday was ""CLUB DAY"", which was in the absolute heart of the ghetto. We would then proceed to go in the locker rooms and change into our swimsuits. The kids in the locker room would yell and scream and rap in our faces and spit at us and scare us. Then we'd get to the pool, and they'd teach us how to swim. I had been on the swim team for years at this point, and i knew every stroke and could swim perfectly. We'd spend 20 minutes doing the doggie paddle, then we would return to the locker room and get scared some more, before driving back to school all wet. 

Lesson: School is fucking ridiculous. 

**4th grade two** - One day in the winter, then we went back inside. The teachers wouldn't tell us why we were outside, and when I asked, I was told to ""mind my own business... they probably just needed us out of there so they could wax the floors... or someth- Y'KNOW RJ, DON'T ASK SO MANY Guuuhhh~ derrn~ QUESTIONS!"". Later i found out that we were outside because there was a bomb threat made to our school. 

Lesson: Don't question anything

**5th grade** - I was biting into my hamburger at school, who told me it was mine. I told her it wasn't mine. She told me it was. I told her I found it in my hamburger, and it wasn't my tooth, because I had all mine. She told me to go show it to the lunchlady. I did. She said it was mine. I told her it wasn't, and explained the situation. She said ""hrm"" and took the tooth and put it in an envelope. She said she don't see how any tooth other than mine could be in a hamburger. I went back and sat down again. Never found out what a tooth was doing in my hamburger.

Lesson: If the lunchlady says so

**5th grade two** - Jorge was in the school play, the acting teacher called me immature, and asked why I couldn't even keep quiet during my friend's play. When I was confused, she said ""WELL... maybe you should have been **in** the play, because you can certainly act confused well enough. You know what you did""... and then she wouldnt listen anymore. 

Lesson: Do not show support for your friends by going to their shows. 

**5th grade three** - We were going to perform with the chorus at Woodbridge Mall. I was singing this Hanukkah song ""Bashana"" in rehearsal when I felt lightheaded. Next thing I know, and sent me to the mall. When it was time to preform the song at the mall, the teacher said she didnt want me to sing it, because I might pass out again. I sang every other song fine, but had to make a scene by edging my way out of the risers before Bashana. 

Lesson: Hebrew songs affect me like kryptonite.

**6th grade** - Taking the advice of my teacher, I jokingly said ""I want mutton chops!"". The fat teacher said ""You got it"" and started to draw mutton chops on my face with a damn makeup pencil. It hurt like hell, and I didn't actually want mutton chops, so I stopped him and said I was kidding. Then the director came up and glared at me, and said I looked ridiculous. To remedy the situation, she had fat teacher now draw a full beard on me with makeup pencil. I looked even more ridiculous, and hurt myself scrubbing the makeup off later. 

Lesson: Just accept mutton chops

**6th grade two** - We were all rushed outside once again, Jorge and I decided to ask the teacher what was going on. She told us that someone had thrown up inside, and the janitors were working on cleaning it. We reminded her jokingly that we were capable of rational thought at this point in our lives, and that answer didn't really make sense. She said ""well, that's what they told the teachers... I don't know what to te ll you."" 

Lesson: Don't trust anyone. ",,t5_2qh96,1349127197.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/10o2xq/when_i_graduated_from_hs_over_ten_years_ago_i/

UPDATE (4/19/2012): DropshipRedditor just sent me reddit gold. Here is a copy of the message exchange. He still hasn't explained anything.

DropshipRedditor's message to me:
&gt;I'm going through all the haters one by one and send them all some Reddit Gold.. So here's yours.

&gt;FYI.. I send Drunken_Economist SO much proof it's ridiculous. He did an excellent job Moderating and making sure I was legit.

&gt;I sent him screenshots of ALL my admins with monthly and yearly sales for each site. Then I uploaded a page with his name and Reddit logo on every site as well. I even showed him my Adwords account that proved my $30k monthly PPC spend on those exact sites.

&gt;What more could you ask for dude?

My response:

&gt;&gt;Your name is listed on a consumer reports website where a handful of customers have filed complaints against you for stealing their money over the past few years. You blatantly lied about your identity and pretended that ""TwitterBirdMarketing"" and ""EthicalSEOFirm"" were business associates of yours

&gt;&gt;It's been 48 hours and you've completely avoided these questions. Sending out reddit gold isn't going to make things better. I'm not out to destroy your reputation. I'm not trying to judge you. I'm not even questioning whether or not you make $100k/yr. Heck

----------

EDIT (4/18/2012): Thanks to the excellent detective work of BananaMoustache, I believe we have enough evidence to state with confidence that DropshipRedditor is full of shit. I was not surprised to read reports of him swindling thousands of dollars out of unsuspecting people over the past few years.

It's unfortunate that my original (duplicate) thread on /r/WTF was removed by the mods. It had significantly more exposure than this one due to the larger viewership of that subreddit. But them's the rules.

Anyway,000 a month by working from home! I've been investing in fiscal quarterly cash flows on the bull market for penny stocks! And so can you!

Here's the story.

Yesterday, and may very well be a legitimate businessman.

This is the thread in question: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/se78n/i_make_over_100k_per_month_running_dropship/

He spent the entire day answering questions and promised to compile all the information into a brief how-to guide, and marketing tools"". Seemed like a really generous thing to do. Many people expressed their gratitude and said that DropshipRedditor had inspired them to start their own businesses.

Here's where it gets sketchy: He published the how-to guide

Ecommerce software: www.volusion.com

SEO and PPC help: EthicalSeoFirm@gmail.com (""honest guys who can rank anything"")

Twitter Marketing: TwitterBirdMarketing@gmail.com (""Twitter geniuses

The first one may be a legitimate company

My first thought was that this guy is trying to lure people in with claims of riches and grandeur

Maybe there is some reasonable explanation, I'll delete this thread.

I sure hope im doing the right thing. But I know a couple things

** EDIT  my wife and I have always been open and honest. She has known about my son from the start and I have always said that if he asks to come live with me that I will say yes.

Once every 3 months I can save up enough to take the day off work and make the 15 hour round trip to his town so I can sit in the coffee shop he works and watch him while I pretend to read the paper. Dont you dare fucking call me a negligent father.

One of them catches eyes with me and shrugs with a grin on her face - the whole ""Can you believe this fucking old man?"" look. She's expecting me to be in on the joke. Instead of giving this fucking valkyrie bitch what she wants, saying ""No."" She looks surprised and turns away.

&gt;&gt;EDIT&lt;&lt; what we know:
Cellphone records checked, or family are known. He's a very happy go-lucky guy who's extremely open-minded and social. If there were any problems on his mind he would have talked to someone, or at least there would be signs.
&gt;&gt;EDIT2&lt;&lt;
I've been told not to put too much information on this, but let's not dwell on that for now. I'll keep this updated if we get anything big.

It's like he walked away from the bar and vanished into thin air. I have no idea what to think.

If people can keep an eye open for him if you're in the area or pass the news around I would really appreciate it. I'm just trying to get the word out to anyone I can. It's almost been a week and we're desperate. Thank you for reading this

They'd already judged my brother and didn't want to help someone like that.  I worried that maybe I'd hurt things more than I'd helped.

I cant talk about it to my friends, that none of what actually HAPPENED matters, because the obvious truth is that nothing could have happened to him.  He's my brother, dont you people understand that?  He CANT be hurt.  He cant be gone.  I can still hear him.

I was on my merry way home from work. I work the night shift at a hotel (which sucks ass) and I had just gotten off around 6 AM. I was cruising to McDonalds for a delicious Sausage and Egg McMuffin when I noticed somebody walking in the middle of the road. Being the idiot that I am

This guy is sprinting at my truck and keeps aligning himself with me as I swerve through the road. I make a last second correction and miss him by inches. I wasn't going that fast, I thought the guy was on PCP or something and I was going to have to pull my knife out and go Rambo on his ass. 

I follow him through a gas station then across the street as he tries to get hit by another car. He ends up in front of a grocery store where he collapses in tears. I roll down my window and can hear the guy sobbing. I mean absolutely the most gut wrenching sobs you can imagine coming from a fully grown man. He looked to be about my age. Pretty clean cut, hair cut. I yell out to him and ask if he's okay. He doesn't respond. 

I keep yelling out to him and finally he responds that he's okay. This guy was just trying to lose a real life game of Frogger, but because he was crying so hard. I present to him my concerns about him running out into traffic and he agrees with me which sets him off into tears again. So at this point I know what he just did was totally fucked. 

What I do next is absolutely stupid in every way I can think, breathe and sit down. He does. We share a cigarette while he tells me about losing his job... Getting kicked out of school... His alcoholic father kicking him out when he got his girlfriend pregnant. Then he goes on to tell me about his girlfriend who went into labor early and then died giving birth... To a baby that did not live.

We talked for about 30 minutes. I eventually ended up talking him out of pulling some shit like this again (for the time being), and to pursue it with the same fury that compelled him to run into traffic and to honor his girlfriend and baby in that way. Fucking cheesy, but I already gave the guy water and $100. Didn't have much more for him... Gave him a ride to a nearby bus stop so the cops (that I called...) wouldn't pick him up. 

Maybe this guy was full of shit, but after an amazing birthday and dealing with this guy, I realize I'm fucking blessed (in the most non-religious way possible). I can only hope that I had the tiniest effect on this guy's life. Because I know that he did, if only for one day. Because goddammit, this will be the best Sunday of my short life.

Peace

Stewart specifically said NOT to make the rally about pot.  This is perfect ammunition for the right to trivialize the rally.  Can we prevent NORML and similar organizations from hijacking the rally?  Or

Edit:  Thank you YouthInRevolt

If you agree

Call Norml: (202) 483-5500 Email Norml: norml@norml.org

Edit 2:  Chadius333 summed up some of my sentiments quite nicely

I really don't know how it could be any more obvious that NORML's presence is not a good thing. This rally, support the tea party, etc, etc, need to see that there is a very large group of people who feel quite differently and are willing to unite, stand up and say something.
Now, the entire conservative side is going to write the rally and all of our efforts off as liberal, hippie bullshit. You will see pot leaf picket signs in every single shot on Fox News... I guarantee it.
I realize a lot of you are strong supporters of the legalization of marijuana (I am one of those people too) but this just isn't the right time or place. This isn't a platform for legalization of marijuana
Anyway

Edit 3:  Even if you are for NORML's strong presence at the rally

Final edit and attempt at clarification:  This is less about the sanity of legalization or whether or not it should be discussed in a rational manner like the other issues. Rather, in my opinion, they should be much more professional about it. This could be the right time if done in the right way. That poster is not it.

I took out the trash

Next day

It doesn’t appear to be originating from the kitchen. It must be the plants… let me get on google and see about those plants. Oh? Indoor plants need to be potted in a special soil or they cause odors… rah rah… ok so check the plants. Looks like regular soil. Must be the plants.

I segregate all the plants into the guest bedroom. Vacuum and deodorize all the areas that held plants. All set. On to my nightly routine.

Groundhog Day syndrome. Next day

This goes on for about a week or so. None of my normal half-assed attempts seem to be having any effect.

That weekend I pulled out the big guns. Friday after work I stopped at Walmart on the way home and stocked up on cleaning supplies. Lots of cleaning supplies. Baking soda, carpet deodorizers, air fresheners, drain cleaners… everything. A couple odd looks and a comment from the checkout girl about it being a little late for spring cleaning, and I am on my way home. Ready for war.

A day and a half later

Monday rolls around. Déjà vu. Come home from work

Not sure what to do next, ask about the sewage, ask about mold, mildew. He suggests to clean the drains again and if it doesn’t go away after that, he would come out to investigate.

About mid-week as I’m coming home from work I pass by (HoAGuy), I believe he said her name was (HoALady). He mentioned she would be better at identifying odors than he was, and we all walked up to my front door. As soon as I opened the door, she immediately commented “That’s a dead animal.”

“It smells like it’s probably something bigger than a mouse

HoAGuy mentioned that if it’s a mouse or a rat or something inside, the HoA would reimburse me for any cost accrued for the removal.

So I contact landlord again

Saturday rolls around, next to the front door. He says it must be something in the wall, quotes me $600 and up to punch holes in the walls and floor looking for it, with no guarantee that it would find it, and it would be our responsibility to fix everything after it’s done. Great. Not looking good.

We step outside and we are chatting about maggots and other delicious topics

We’ve lived here about a year and a half and have never seen a soul in or out of the unit next to us. I’ve always assumed someone bought it to flip it and never got around to it. I mentioned to the animal control guy “Hmm… I wonder if it’s maybe in that vacant unit…” he says it’s worth looking into before we tear up my walls. So he gives me his estimate, plump nasty flies… all over the inside of the glass.

“Whoa hold up a sec, something’s dead in there…” he replied.

Of course, explained the situation and he said he would start making calls to try to find out who owns the unit so we can get someone in there to check for the dead animal.

Monday rolls around again. I get home, (ElderlyLady) lives there, she’s a recluse.” Uh oh.

I explain the situation, and starts describing that he has also been fighting the same odor problems. HoAGuy starts banging on the door… no answer. Other neighbors start coming out. Several people chime in that they haven’t seen ElderlyLady in at least a month. I’m thinking about how I haven’t seen anyone in there since we moved in. Apparently, an elderly lady lived there, who was very reclusive. Described as mid seventies, doesn’t leave the house often, and doesn’t answer the door. Very private. We never heard her through the wall, never seen her. All the windows had been covered up with white blankets or sheets for as long as I remember. The sheets were all tattered and ripped. Thick cobwebs between them and the glass. No signs that anyone lived there.

As we are banging on doors and windows

So finally we call the police, and nothing. She lets us know that the fire dept. is on the way to open the door. About 15 minutes later the firemen arrive and pry open the door. As soon as the door was opened, the odor came out swinging…and boy was it a brawler.

The 2 officers stepped inside the doorway and after about 10 seconds came out looking green and gagging.

HoAGuy walked over to them

Fast forward about 2 hours, the odor almost knocked people over.

HoAGuy started asking the officer some questions

So I did what any normal person would do in that situation… I ordered some wings

Well… maybe normal isn’t the right word…

1296066952.0,f9i1u,Advice for all who dissent on the streets and face Riot Police,SolidSolidarity,1213,540,625,"I've been an active participant in many demonstrations that have faced riot police in Greece and other parts of Europe and I would like to share what I've learned with those who are struggling against their government. 

I've noticed a striking lack of equipment on the part of the protesters in Tunisia and Egypt that should be easy to obtain and will greatly help them continue to their struggle against the government. 

Here's my best advice.

* Goggles

Goggles will protect your eyes against tear gas (CS gas) and pepper spray

* Masks

While masks may create an anti-social environment

* Gas Mask

Dust masks hardly work against pepper spray or CS gas. Use a gas mask that has a filter, but are especially useful against CS gas which will incapacitate you after inhaling. They fit well under a t-shirt too.  Remember!  after each major gas attack on a manifestation, the filter of an inexpensive gas mask will have to be replaced.  

* Body Sweat

Gas often sticks to body sweat. Freshly showered bodies attract less painful gas

* Hammers

Without an abundance of rocks on the streets

* Bats

(Sticks

Can be used in a place of hammer in some situations for making rocks. They're also crucial for defense. Don't let yourself be empty-handed against oppressors.

* Fire extinguishers

Though they're heavy

* Maalox

Maalox works well against pepper spray. Mix it with water and then douse your face with the mix. Some people swear by it. You can experiment with other antacids as well.  

* Which gas is in the air?

(From a distance) Tear gas will make you cough

* Water

Carry as much water with you as you can to fight dehydration. Stay in the fight!

. . . 

Additions: (How could I have forgotten?)

* Gloves

Leather gloves will protect your hands while making rocks, but this can't be recommended unless you're wearing a high grade mask.

* Shinguards

Shinguards will save your ankles if you kick back a gas cannister and it happens to go off. This may be especially easy in Egypt as I think they play lots of soccer there. I have not worn shinguards

* Helmets

Police often go right for the head with their bludgeons. In Greece many people wear motorcycle helmets in demonstrations. Another kind of helmet, but a helmet can make all the difference between permanent damage (or death) and living to fight another day. I will get a helmet soon.

Every time I asked her what was bothering her she just cried harder and louder then get pissed at me. She did this until 2 am that night, and then started bawling as soon as she came through the door. She did this for four days straight

The forth day she walked through my door and started crying I asked her to leave but that only made her cry harder so I grabbed her and shoved her out of my door. She instantly stopped crying and kept saying ""OK I'll stop!!"". I wasn't trying to be mean but this was about to be my fourth sleepless night and she couldn't even explain why she was doing this. I didn't see a single tear on her face the entire time. She did it for hours everyday and I couldn't take it anymore.

She keeps texting me asking to talk but I've been ignoring them. Something about all this just feels wrong. I'm angry at her because she did nothing but cry and act shitty for four days

Edit: typo fix and she called me blocked a second ago. She still won't explain why she cried and kept asking if we can meet up at a restaurant. I hung up and she keeps sending text messages now.

1292981558.0,epn2f,My grandmother's account of what it was like living in Germany during WWII,TUNGSTEN_MAN,956,304,285,"Hey Reddit

I recently found a 4 page document my grandmother typed up in 2001 about what it was like living in Germany as a little girl during WWII. I just finished retyping it back into a word document. Its a very interested read.

For some back ground information. My grandmother was from a small town called Friedrichshafen in south western Germany, my great grand father was some kind of engineer or factory worker. And the area produced a lot of machinery, probably used in war, which made the area a huge target for bombers. My grandmother moved to America sometime after the war and met my grandfather.

Here is what she had to say about Germany during WWII. Ive preserved it exactly as she wrote it, and so the organization is a little funny.

May 2001
Historical Childhood Memories of the Second World War and Postwar Years.

I was born in 1938, right across the lake from Switzerland.

My Earlier Memories are of being carried downstairs to the basement in the middle of the night by my parents. I was a sound sleeper and never heard the night air raids, the air pressure of the exploding bombs would break open the featherbeds and the flying down would probably suffocate us. Our parents tried to get us to go back to sleep on the pallets, but that was impossible with all the terrifying war noises all around us.

During each air raid we would be kneeling in a circle in the basement holding hands and praying to be safe as the bombs were falling all around us

We were also issued gas masks as it was feared that chemical warfare might be involved. They looked horrible to a little child and breathing through it sounded awful. The only other time I heard this sound was when it was made by Darth Vader in the Star Wars movie. It still gave me a creepy feeling.

On cloudy days we would ask our parents to go outside to play because we knew the planes could not come today due to poor target visibility. We played in the rubble of bombed out buildings. The craters made in the ground by the exploded bombs would fill with water and we would catch frogs to eat. In the winter the bomb craters would freeze over and we would slide on the ice or watch tadpoles and bugs move around under the ice.

The was an anti-aircraft flack station near my home in a meadow. A few soldiers were stationed there and if the siren sounded, as we had railroads and shipping lines.

The streets would be all torn up and water mains broken

Sometimes a “Soup Kitchen” would come by to dish out soup for everyone. It was just a big barrel on wheels, but we were hungry and glad to get it. The supply lines were all bombed out and there was nothing on the store shelves to be bought, so everyone resorted to a bartering system. But after a while we ran out of things to Barter with.

There were some farms in the area and people would come from far away to try to trade their belongings for some food. One time my parents heard that a farmer had buried a dead born calve. We did not know if it was sick or what it died of, so that if the thief would come again he would be doused with the contents of the bucket as he tried to open the door. At one time my Dad was lucky enough to get a little pig. This pig was always hungry just like us and so it would squeal a lot and that was a worry to us as we did not want the neighbors to know we had an illegal little piglet. We also raised rabbits, we would pluck grass from the ditches and feed that to the rabbits and my dad would butcher them when they were big enough and that made a tasty meal for all of us.

I remember my mother trying to cook for us and there was never any kind of fat to cook with, she didn’t know what it was. So she brought it home and washed it and it turned out to be some wool or yarn, which she knitted into a sweater for us.

When we were in school, she had no idea if we were alive or not. So as soon as the raid was over we would get out of the good people’s shelter and continue to go home, always the same way, so my mother would be able to find us more easily.

We could not get clothes for us growing children so my Mom and her sister cut down their dresses and sewed them into clothes for us children. My Father repaired our shoes as best he could and we had to save them for the coldest part of the winter so we would not wear the shoes out too soon. We would walk barefoot until long after the ground had frost on it. Our feet would actually burn from the cold ground

My dad was always supplying first aid to the gruesome wounded right after an air raid and saved many lives. He worked in a defense factory and was not on the front

Seven times the roof was off our home
Houses were burning all around us many times during a raid. We had basement windows without glass in them to protect us from flying

My mother was being shot at while riding her bike to do an errand. The bullet whistled right past her ear.

My parent’s friends visited us on a Sunday so they took us children for a walk up a hill with the destination being a World War 1 Memorial Chapel. Soon a low flying airplane came and started shooting at us. We ran under a tree for protection from the bullets, our parent’s friends would put us on the ground and would shield us from the bullets with their bodies. The bullets came so close to our heads that we felt the vibrations of the ground as the bullets hit and dirt being sprayed all over us. We finally made it to the chapel, all of us unharmed but shaking from the close encounter as we peeked out the door and watched the plane leave.

We lived close to Switzerland and my Dad would listen to a radio station in Bern. This was not allowed as we might hear the truth about how the war was going. He would turn the volume real low, my mother did not know what happened to him. He was scheduled to work on the rockets being developed in Travermuende, but after that remark and interrogation his work assignment was cancelled, and ruined his career. But at least he was alive and back home with us again. It was also time for my older sister to join the Hitler Youth group. My father did not allow it and guess what, her grades immediately took a nose drive.

Occupation years after the war: We had French occupation – I saw a soldier walking with an orange in his hands, but he did not. We were all very skinny and always hungry during and after the war. But that was nothing compared to some other things the soldiers did to the older girls.

It was also the first time I saw a black man, which he very graciously endured. One of these occupational soldiers enjoyed scaring us children as we walked to school. He was a Mess cook and had very long, sharp knifes. Our school was bombed out, so we had to walk to the next village to go to school there and he would always wait for us in different places in the village and scream and run after us swinging his long sharp knives. We would try to avoid him and get to school on different routes, but he would be there too, it was very scary for a little girl.

One of my Uncles was a prisoner of war in Russia, that it would kill them. And it was true, those who did not listen to the doctor’s advice died soon after coming home. My uncle survived by eating potato peels and whatever else he could scrounge from our little garbage can. It was a pitiful sight to see, but he survived!

We lived at the dge of town and there was a Prisoner of War camp one block from our house. I belief it was mostly Russians. We would try and put some food and cigarettes stubs through the fence. The Camp had a very fierce dog that scared us many times as we would try to sneak up to the fence and drop something through for the prisoners.

During an air raid the camp gates would be opened and let the captured soldiers out

I remember seeing the enemy tanks with their big guns coming up over a hill toward us and it was very scary for a little child. It was a Sunday in May and we were on the way to church. The adults told us that this meant that the war was over, who would wait till evening when all the relatives were home and then we would gather together to open the package in her home. There was canned meat and food and sugar and coffee. It was fabulous food and all was evenly divided. Everything was in English on the packages and not knowing the language we had no idea what was in it until it was opening. So it was always a surprised. These packages were very important to us.

Also, after all, this was not War, it was a fun 4th of July fireworks and I was safe here in America..

* Chicks dig smart guys

* If you're EVER having trouble with anything GO TO YOUR PROFESSORS OFFICE HOURS AND BUG HIM/HER. They have office hours for a reason and it will only help you if your instructor knows your name. (This could be the difference between your instructor letting you make up that test you missed or not)

* If you don't have any questions to ask your instructor during his office hours, and they will remember you for it.
* Don't go home or back to your dorm between classes
* Don't bring your laptop to class
* If you are a gamer and you have a big test coming up
* Networking is important. Make sure you meet/know someone in all of your classes. When you go to class tomorrow don't be afraid to introduce yourself to the person sitting next to you. 
* Stay away from the ""learning commons"" or any area with a lot of traffic in your schools library. You're there to study
* Pack a lunch to take with you to the library so you aren't tempted to quit early because you *think* you're hungry.
* Don't listen to music while studying, or if you have a smartphone download whitenoise lite.
* If you're studying for ANYTHING that requires memorization, N = repeat card now, L = Repeat Card later. PLUS it saves all of your flashcards so you can access them from any computer or your smartphone/ipod.

**General:**

* Never EVER use any kind of a ""pick up line"" on a girl. They don't work. A girl will be more impressed if you can approach her and carry a solid conversation with her

* Learn how to tie a necktie.
* The only appropriate time to wear a bowtie is with a tuxedo.
* If you go to a house party
* Just because someone is a good friend
* When grocery shopping for the ""cost per ounce/pound/kg/whatever"" on the price tag. It makes choosing what brand to buy much easier and cost efficient.
* Be frugal but don't buy the supersaver cheap-o cheese. It's gross. Spend the extra dollar and get the decent stuff.
* Most universities offer free STD testing. There's nothing to be afraid of or embarrassed about. Get tested.
* If you're getting someone of age to buy you booze
* Avoid eating at fast food restaurants
* Don't leave your laptop plugged in 24/7. It will murder your battery life. Unplug it when it is fully charged. **EDIT** I have been informed that I am wrong about this. WHOOPS
* Brush your teeth.


That's about all I have right now. I'm gonna work on my electromagnetism homework and maybe check back later.

Three weeks ago I married the love of my life, including 4 years of a long distance relationship when we only saw each other in person 3 or 4 weekends a year. Believe me when I tell you that I could not wait for us to begin our life together as a married couple, and that I was really looking forward to all the memories we would create together, starting with our honeymoon.

The problem, reddit: [read in the voice of very old grandma'] ""Pictures are not memories, and the important thing is to value the moments you live together"", or some form of that phrase... Well, Gran Gran Reddit, in the many years of our very long relationship we have learned to value every second we spend together, but you can't deny that pictures sure do help in maintaining those memories. 

We are both severely heartbroken, filling out their online forms... yesterday I even went back to the airport to speak directly with the lost &amp; found office, and it's always the same answer: ""the item you are looking for has not been found, and has probably been lost for good"" (I'm paraphrasing). I understand that ultimately me losing my camera is my fault, and not theirs, but I can't help but think that I was screwed over. All airlines are required to perform a security sweep of the airplane, which means that either the Delta employee who found my camera on the plane decided to keep it, constituting a major security breach). Either way, so one can only hope...

The flight we were in was Delta flight 0087 from Venice (VCE) to New York (JFK) on July 16

That all changed when I started waiting tables, but you can't help but wonder if you did something to piss the the person off, or if they were just a cheap ass.

So, a card, and we were slow, so we even gave them a section by the fireplace all to themselves.  When they arrive I've got their table all set up, they seemed to really enjoy their meal, and I even threw them a complimentary desert because I can, and they seemed cool.

They get up to leave, as they were going to leave I just went up to them and said, ""Was there anything wrong with your service?"" and the lady got a confused look and said it was all perfect, the guy knew why I was asking, but even he said everything had been great. So I say, ""Are you sure about that?"" and kinda let the book flop open to show the lack of any money whatsoever.  ""You didn't leave him a tip?!""  She was obviously mortified and shot him a shitty look.  He mumbles ""I forgot...lemme run to the car..."" He comes back and begrudgingly hands me a greasy, wadded up five.

I'm trying

Mostly

I'm sorry to my best friend who worried so much after I passed out as we walked to get coffee. 

I'm sorry to my parents who have tried nothing but to get me to eat 

I'm sorry to my sister

I tried last month. 

On March 1st, I was back to 140 for the first time in two years. 

I was also consumed with a deep self-hatred that absolutely consumed me. 

So I stopped trying. 

As of this morning, and 122 pounds.

In December of 2012 I was 119 pounds. I almost felt happy about myself, and shaking. I starved myself into a muted fuzz that disconnected me from the stress and the depression. At the time, it was an escape. But that is not a solution. 

I tell myself I would like to get help

However

And the first step towards that is admitting it. 

So here we are

I am 18 years old, I have my doctor's phone number punched into my phone and am ready to schedule an appointment to talk about my health and my future. 

This is a big step for me. It will be tough but I hope I can bring myself to beat this. I hope I can overcome the shame and the fierce social stigma surrounding male anorexia and the fear and self-doubt that has plagued me my entire life. I at least owe it to my sister. She has too much potential to waste time worrying about me and making sure I eat at least a slice of the bread she baked for me before going out. Ems

I don't want to put him down, looking for a loving home in the Portland, OR area (or within a few hundred miles)",BinguniR34,359

He is a ten year old German Shepherd named Dep.  My family got him as a puppy during Spring Break of 2002.  We inherited the dog when my parents divorced and each moved on.  My sister

We kept the dog and he became a part of our life.  I finally got my first piloting job in Oregon last year.  We moved with my wife from Oklahoma and brought Dep with us.  Hardship ensued

As a pilot, the others would just keep him in a cage for the rest of his life if he does not get adopted.  We started considering euthanasia, I don't want to do it, but I think it would be more humane than for him to live the rest of his life in a cage away from his family.

My heart is breaking, smart, loving, loyal dog.  He is also very protective and does not like other dogs, at all.  He has lived most of his life with cats, so he is capable of getting used to them.  He also does shed, right now he is shedding his winter coat and has chunks of hair falling!

We live in the Portland, I hope this pulls at your heart strings and help me out.

My brother and sister in law are beyond heartbroken and having a really hard time trying to cope with their daughter taking her own life. My sister in law also just lost a close

On top of their grief, but they had refused until the bills piled up. My sis in law posted to her facebook today that they set up a fund for her funeral expenses through America First Credit Union. It's called Jasmyn Nelson Memorial Fund, account number 9044256.

Reddit

I'm asking for any help I can get them because they can't afford the counseling they need right now or to stay in school. They are too overwhelmed with grief. I love my brother

If not, Reddit.

Edit: I guess the only way to donate is by logging into your bank online and doing an electronic funds transfer to America First Credit Union to Jasmyn Nelson memorial fund (routing number is 324377516)

Edit: I guess I posted this a little too soon. They just opened the fund today and my brother hasn't had the chance to make a PayPal account for it yet. He probably will have it set up in the next hour or so.

A brother and sister (ages 9ish and 6ish) were at the register when I arrived so, and *alone* in this shithole convenience store on a busy intersection.  Bread, peanut butter, two bags of chips, two bottles sodas on the counter.  The clerk ran their card once.  And twice. And a 3rd time.  It looked like the PIN wasn't working, and the stress/anxiety on the brother's face was obvious with every failed checkout-- something I remember experiencing regularly ~20 years ago.

When the clerk ran their card a 4th time, and it looked like they were about to go home empty handed.

Before the clerk was able to make a final attempt, he probably thought I was being a dick by jumping ahead of them. 

I said something retarded like, sometimes my card doesn't work either,"" and exited with my stuff, but the kids were still standing there waiting to pay for their food.  I could see the clerk explain a couple of times that they were good to go and could leave, but they didn't move.

That if a teacher had a gun at New Haven that somehow they would have become Mr. Eastwood and stopped the whole thing before it got started.

*Maybe* if a teacher had a gun they could shoot any intruders before they were shot themselves

Are teachers going to keep their gun on their hip? In their desk? In a safe? I don't like having my cell phone visible because of pranksters or teens who want something shiny

If a student feels like he has nothing left to live, right?) and a teacher tries to break up the fight by pointing a gun. Could you imagine the outcry? What happens when a teacher shoots a student or a student finds a way to get the gun. People aren't stupid, if they know a gun will be there they will devise a plan.

So what will having a gun in the classroom do? Will it make anybody safer? Or will it just put guns in every classroom?

I will walk around campus and look everyone I pass in the eye while smiling.

I will then tally the number of people that make eye contact with me

Then the next day I will make eye contact

I'll get back to you in a day. 

(PS-This is purely for my entertainment because I am weird)

Edit- Sorry for the late edit.  So
The results:

*52 people looked at me then looked away immediately
    -Some people did the old ""Oh

*23 people looked and returned smiles

*35 people ignored me completely

The strange and more important thing is the smiling had more of an effect on me than I thought it would.  After smiling the whole way to a class I would catch myself having a slight grin on my face in that class.  I participated in and enjoyed that class more(least favorite class).  A (cute) girl I've never talked to talked to me and walked with me after class. Another kid I never talked to talked to me too.  So I highly suggest smiling more often.  It made me feel better all day and made me new friends.  We will see how a blank stare does tomorrow.


Edit- Day 2

This is getting to be a long post. I enjoy doing these experiments and seeing the out comes. 

So here are the results for the blank stare.

*39 people looked at me then looked away immediately

*0 people smiled at me

*61 people ignored me completely

I believe more people ignored me because its easier to ignore a stare.  A stare means less than a stare and a smile so more people disregarded it.  At least

After performing this experiment I have got the feeling that people want to be noticed and stand out.  I could tell this because of the way they looked at me when I smiled at them.  However,False,,t5_2qh96,True,,,t3_daupc

So Monday, at least until that day.   Five or six douchebags and some blondes were there swilling beer, taking shots, and being loud bastards in general.

About a half hour later, and he stalks towards me in his best Tough Guy walk.

He lived downtown, Valentine's Day must have fallen on a Sunday. His yard was littered with oversized construction paper hearts and poster boards with ""I LOVE YOU DADDY!"" scrawled in a child's hand.

""What's with the Valentine's?"" I asked. 

""Must have been visiting day at the jail yesterday, then they left them, so the guys can still see them, I guess.""

""Oh

Valentine's Day is one of those crappy holidays that's not a big deal

Back when I was dating my soon-to-be husband, excessive. I'm not really an excessive kind of gal, but dear god there is something lovely about getting the most beautiful bouquet in the office. It vanquishes all the times you never got a lousy carnation in high school when the Student Council delivered flowers to each classroom. It was a Valentine's Day fundraiser, but it should have been called, Today-Is-Popularity-Contest-Day-And-You-Lose.  

Flowers like that make you beam for a week

Sometimes

And I'd say

The relationship aged, the flowers stopped. No problem. 

A couple of years ago, trying to hide it from me. 

Inside was a box of stale Fannie May's and an unsigned card. 

For all the nonsense that Valentine's is

The next couple of years, wonderful, fresh chocolates that satisfied my sweet tooth and subtly said, ""I care about you."" 

So today is Valentine's Day

I'm not even sure if he'll call today. I love him so. I'm not sure if he loves me back. I'm not sure if he knows if he loves me. 

And I am sitting here trying to find love in the memory-scent of flowers delivered to my office ages ago

I know that won't happen. All I can do is stand in this yard

I hope he looks down. I hope he knows I am wishing him a Happy Valentine's Day. 
 
I hope he comes back to me.

1371052026.0,1g79ci,My family received a serious death threat and we don't know what to do.,Afterlife09,723,161,222,"My family received a very serious death threat


Last year I posted a thread about how I was assaulted on the street in Pakistan.

[The reddit post about my incident from last year](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/ye63w/i_was_assaulted_and_threatened_to_be_killed_by_a/)

It's been a few months since then, but nothing too serious like that last one. People shout at you on the street, which is normal in Pakistan, I get that. Or people insult me thinking I don’t understand them (I do understand), which isn’t a big deal either, but no physical assaults since then.


Otherwise

Then yesterday my mother was coming home while I was at work and a man was standing outside our house on a motorcycle. He threw an envelope into the house and rode off,000,000 or Death'** (image below), meaning pay that amount or be killed.

**[Death Threat Image](http://i.imgur.com/vZYVO46)**

She called the police and the local enforcements, or if the person pays they’ll continue to extort money from them.  Their next step will be to throw a grenade into my house to scare me to pay up, and the police can't do anything to stop a grenade, but they said they would try their best. They suggested hiring armed guards, which I can’t afford. 

They said each of the bullets represents each person living in the house, and I.


I've filled out a police report

I know this all sounds like propaganda against the country


People should know

Everybody tells me *‘Well this is Pakistan’*, and promote terrorism because ‘This is Pakistan’, right?

When stuff like this happens I’m expected to say ‘that’s life! If I get shot

This is why this country just keeps getting worse and worse. This attitude that ‘It’s not our fault

And I’m not talking about politics; I’m talking about the mentality and attitude of the people. This country is just falling apart. 

People here are batshit crazy. That’s about it. They just are. It must be something in the water

Not all of them

If I'm going to die anyway


And I mean this is a really serious threat. The bullet is considered our death warrant; it’s not something to take lightly. People who’ve received these bullets get killed. And not just in the privacy of their homes

I can’t afford to pay their demands; I don’t have that kind of money. It’s about US$100

And I really don’t know what to do at this point. We’ve left the house for now, but I guess that doesn’t mean much here. 

What I’m trying to say here is that I’m just sick of it. I’m really sick and tired of the insults and the threats and having my life in danger every time I step outside. I’m sick of my family being in danger. Tomorrow, my family could be dead. I’m not afraid of dying, but I’m just tired of it all. 

It’s just way too much.

**EDIT/UPDATE 1:** 

Okay

Our FIR (police report) needs to be refiled

We've been told to wait it out and lie low until they get in touch with us again. Which could either be through phone (you just pay off someone in a phone center and they can get you any number)

I don't know. So far, but we will be keeping our guard up. Tomorrow is a country-wide strike apparently, so maybe they'll try to contact us. 

*Fellow sane people in Pakistan*, so I'll give a shout out to you guys who are here in this country with me, **stay safe yourselves**, you know how those days are.

And finally I'd like to thank all you guys for the support I'm getting from reddit. I've been showing my family your postings and they are very grateful. I will be responding to some of the comments directly

1) Getting out of Pakistan, or at least try. Funds are an issue but to get the family out we'll figure it out.
2) We have talked about taking asylum/becoming a refugee
3) On getting a firearm; We were given this advice by the police/DHA as well. I know in this country it's probably something one should do

I'll keep updating as things go. Right now we're just waiting to see what's next. 

**EDIT/UPDATE 2:**

So they still aren't giving us a police report

Weekend was really quiet

It's just odd

**EDIT/UPDATE 3:**
CPLC said we're not getting an FIR. They said they want to wait for the 2nd threat/contact before we'll get one

We're going to keep trying to get that FIR

**EDIT/UPDATE 4:**

They just showed up at our house.

My mom hired someone to stay at the house

He just called and said a group of people on bikes arrived and are demanding to be let in.

We've called the police, our home alarm company, everyone we could think off. The guys got away by the time they arrived, but because they weren't let in, everyone agrees they'll make another attempt tonight or within the next day or so.

I'll be updating as things develop. It's 10:23pm Pakistan time.

**EDIT/UPDATE 5:**

This is really bad

**EDIT/UPDATE 6:**

Here's what we know

From what the guy we hired said, enough to know within a few days what region the guy guarding our house is from.

These people don't plan on kidnapping us

They said this isn't normal for extortionists, and that they keep coming back and parking outside tells them that this isn't a normal case. They are just too damn open about this  That topped with how extremely observant they've been makes no sense to the police.

We're on the phone with the CPLC right now, this behavior isn't normal for extortionists. They said it's just really strange. 

I am really freaked out now. My family is really freaked out. We don't know what the hell is happening.

Them constantly telling us it isn't normal and that it's a strange case is much worse than them just being extortionists.",,t5_2qh96,1371758689.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1g79ci/my_family_received_a_serious_death_threat_and_we/

Take care

---

I don't know what I'm looking for by posting this. I suppose this is me searching for help from anywhere before I give up and crawl back into the lonely world I've built for myself. But I need to do this while a part of me still wants an answer.

I'm hurting, and as I approach my 23rd birthday it kills me inside to admit now that I've had more moments in pain than not.

My childhood was stunted by this terrible development. For that first year I was so lost in this pain that I thought of little else. I got older. By 13 I'd learned how to compartmentalize my consciousness: my day-to-day pains were isolated in the corner of my brain, praying to God to just wake up the next morning feeling better.

That prayer was never answered. The pain hit a new level at 16, or even talk theology or philosophy or politics with my friends... but by this point in my life I had hit another 60%-milestone: by now, the majority of my brainpower was directed to blocking out/covering up the pain, and I had far less capacity for being a friend or a son.

My mom must have noticed my condition, that they couldn't help me; second, that I had stopped feeling pain in other parts of my body. I couldn't feel anything else, really. There was my leg pain and nothing. The therapy didn't ultimately fix me, but it helped me understand how deeply this problem had infected me. The pain had become a constant buzzing permeating my thoughts, a wall no other event or sensation could bring down. I had half my face torn off a few months later in a car accident (I lost enough blood that I couldn't stand for two days), and not even *that* overpowered the pain in my legs. And yet, all of this was child's play.

I went to college in the fall of 2006. The combination of walking across campus and living on the fifth floor of the dorms nearly drove me to suicide. I discovered yet another peak of burning agony... I surrendered to it seven weeks later and dropped out, letting them understand how bad I was hurting.

And ever since, I may as well run 6 miles a day. So I did. I even joined the Air Force for a while (which didn't work out for entirely separate reasons; no one in basic training ever noticed that I was in excruciating pain).

I got back on top of my pain in 2009. I rediscovered my dream of being a writer, collapsing when a knee gave or a foot screamed out. Before I had time to realize how bad it was I'd already discovered the numbing effects of alcohol. And with rare exception I've been drinking every night for almost a year. My dreams have taken a backseat to the reality of the harshness of what I'm doing to myself.

I need serious help. I just completed a round of appointments with a knee specialist. The X-rays came back negative for any compelling cause of my pain. And so did the MRIs. This morning they requested that I go back into physical therapy, especially after 13 years of horror.

I don't know what to do now. The only solution I have is to sink deeper into alcohol

**Edit:** (and sort of a tl;dr) I would first like to thank all of you for extending such a wealth of well-wishes and possible forms of treatment. I'm putting together a massive list of everything and will begin a renewed search for answers on Monday. Also, well, more pertinent facts, such as diagnosis history and actual descriptions of pain. Here it is:

*9 years old: Throbbing pain in feet. Family doctor could not diagnose; sent to orthopedist who put me through physical therapy and made orthodic insoles for my feet. He diagnosed me with Osgood-Schlatter's disease and said that the pain would go away once I'd stopped growing.

*~17: Done growing, but this has never been proven. I enter into physical therapy for a period of roughly 6 months.

*Present: I can barely bring myself to walk now, and he wants me to go back to physical therapy. I can't afford it and I'm not convinced it would even help.",,False,,t5_2qh96,True,,

Photos and video of Levinson have been sent to the family years after his capture showing his health in rapid decline. 

If you have any information that can help the family find Bob

There's also a [petition](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/make-rescuing-us-citizen-robert-levinson-being-held-hostage-middle-east-2007-top-priority/GyK0KhgS) to make rescuing him a priority. 

Levinson is now the second longest hostage held in American History. 

This is one of those time when I think Reddit can do something very important.

Being black, or anything else is a fact. It's more than likely the easiest way to single them out when referring to them in the third person. If in a room full of Chinese men, there was one female who was of German descent, it'd be so easy to either say, ""the woman"" or ""the white person"". It's much more efficient and frankly more honest and forthcoming.  By intentionally avoiding the obvious, it's actually slightly offensive in its own right. I quite like being black. I like the ""black culture"", I like the innate sense of unity I have with other black people. Don't sell me short because you think you're doing the right thing. 

Racism is having a dislike or disregard for someone based solely on race. Hate  all niggers and wetbacks? That's racist.  Acknowledge that someone has a different genetic make-up as a distinguishing feature? That's rational. 

This post could probably be taken a million wrong ways

TL;DR: racism isn't what some people think it is.

Before I go further, please don't say anything. I made this account because I needed this to be anonymous. I haven't written anything like this in a while, so I apologize in advance if my stories seem disjointed, or if this isn't the quality of writing reddit expects.

**First

When I was 12, and my parents were expecting me to make all the decisions for my 6 year old brother and me while they were pulling all the emotional tricks in the book. My mother had been cheating on my father with a farmer. She married him, and he had a daughter that was 8 months older than me. At first, it was very awkward. I was fat. She was skinny. I was a girl that had no idea how to be a girl. She wore skirts. I was a computer geek. She was a social butterfly. I wasn't good with rules. She got straight A's. We clashed.

Eventually, I learned she wasn't quite the perfect princess that I had been led to believe. She was just a lot better at hiding her rebellions than I was. We got into so much trouble together. Or, more aptly, I got into a lot of trouble, as her dad couldn't ever believe she'd do anything wrong. It wasn't her fault, and she never tried to blame me for anything. It's just how it was. 

Now


**Story #1:**

We were 13. Although I had a computer, I know. Really, it was the only option at the time. This is before ISPs were a thing, especially in rural areas. 

I remember the first thing I read on the internet in a chat room: ""I make slapping noises when I dance naked in the rain.""

I was appalled, although I can't recall what she said. We laughed about it for years. When she went to sleep that night, I booted up the computer again and logged back on. I sat there until the 10 free hours was completely used up. She woke up that morning and freaked out, until I pointed out I had a stack of 10 free hour AOL floppies. She got over it, and then she taught me how to play Doom.


**Story #2:**

We were 15. It was a typical hot summer in the midwest, and I was so jealous. I was reading a book out loud to her, and she sat up and took off her sunglasses. 

""I have some pot. We should try it.""

I hadn't ever really considered anything like that. She'd just got her first real high school boyfriend, and she was really my only friend. I couldn't figure out the social system at school, so I'd just given up. I was so happy anytime we got to spend time together. Besides that, I had a curious mind, and I liked things that sound like trouble, so I agreed.

I remember sitting there smoking a poorly rolled joint behind the barn


**Story #3:**

We're 16. Our parents have now refused to let us close the door to my bedroom when we were in there, we'd quote lines from the movie back and forth, giggling uncontrollably.


**Story #4:**

I installed Linux. She'd been trying to learn along with me, things progressed. She would find a house that was abandoned but still in good repair, and I would buy books with the credit card numbers and send them to that house. We were not good teenagers. We never meant to cause harm, but we never really thought our actions through. The first book I ever illegally bought was TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1. The first book she ever illegally bought was an unauthorized biography of Courtney Love. She bought some miracle substance from High Times that would supposedly allow her to pass a drug test. I don't know if it worked. Probably not, but somehow she managed to maintain a job through her teenage years. I lasted a week at Hardees before rage quitting.


**Story #5:**

She was smoking pot with her boyfriend most of the time. I would smoke sometimes, I'd speak into it, telling stories. She loved to hear me talk. She loved to hear me sing. She was the only person who ever told me I was good at these things. She made me believe her. She told me I was amazing. She helped me build my self esteem. I hated myself, and I hated my life. She got me through it. She told me I'd either end up incredibly successful or on America's Most Wanted. I really don't think I'd be here today if it wasn't for her.

**Onward.**

I left when I was 17 to pursue my career. It was a good move for me, but she was afraid to leave the area where she grew up. She had so much family there. I had so very little that it was easy for me. I didn't blame her for this, but it made me sad. I knew she could get so much more out of life if she'd just try.

She told me I should write a book about our exploits. We joked about passing it off as fiction, and we'd laugh and shake our heads. How did we get through those years acting like we did? We would agree that we were both so incredibly lucky. 

As the years went on, so she ended up having some problems. She went on to go to school to be an RN, the same thing her mother did. It was tough, but she was getting through it. I visited when her child was first born. I was worried, because I couldn't imagine having a child that wouldn't ever be able to be independent. I was worried she wouldn't be able to handle it. She seemed so much stronger than I ever could have been in that situation. I thought she was doing OK. Now, it looks like I was wrong.

The first google hit that came up for her name was a story from last year about how she had been caught with heroin and other drugs in jail. It had her mug shot. It looked nothing like her. She looked so old... so broken. So not like the girl I grew up with. I didn't understand how the person I knew had been reduced to a crappy headline, and I realized it mentioned a prior felony. I kept digging.

I found the obituary. It was dated from a year ago. It said she died in her home

I found another news article stating that she'd died of a heroin overdose. I stopped digging.

I posted on her facebook wall

A few years ago, only a few people knew, and she got over it. Or so they thought. She turned herself in later for some traffic related offenses, and they found the drugs on her. Who does that? Who has to be in that state of mind to think that going into a jail cell voluntarily with drugs on their person is a good idea? No one knew she'd been doing heroin. Not her family. Not her husband. Not her best friend. 

They sent her to boot camp for 9 months. They shaved her head. She had beautiful hair that I was so envious of when we were growing up. When she got out

One morning late last year, and she must not have realized that after being off of it for so long, her body couldn't tolerate whatever dosage she'd been taking before. She died of a heroin overdose.

I don't know what to think. I don't know what to do. This happened a year ago,False,,t5_2qh96,1342153047.0,,,t3_whbxf

**Details and background:**


About 7 or 8 years ago my older brother started a business selling a very different type of belt


For a while he really only sold them through friends, for a couple of years. Here is a college newspaper clipping of my brother entering into a speed pitch competition with his belts back in 2008 -- [http://imgur.com/Q0FIsb4](http://imgur.com/Q0FIsb4)


Cut to 2012, but it got to the point where the demand fueled a necessity for growth—and grow it did. During this time a few competitors began popping up, including MissionBelt.com, but that was never an issue for them. Competition is healthy and business continued to grow regardless.


2012 was a big year for them and he ended up leaving his full time job to focus on the belts.  Plus


My brother was stoked. But then he was hit with a bombshell from an unlikely assailant


On the April 26th 2013 show of Shark Tank


I don’t watch the show but the morning after it aired one of my other brothers called me and told me to watch and said I would be shocked. What I saw left me feeling sick. The belts my cousins are selling are an exact copy of the ones my brother originally started selling back in 2007 (comparison [http://imgur.com/nKSuFZY](http://imgur.com/nKSuFZY) ). The fact that my cousins had founded Mission Belt (along with a few other people we know and grew up with) and kept it a secret was such a shock to say the least. For me, all the while they kept this secret. My younger brother had even been living with one of their brothers for the last year! 


I’ve brought the story to Reddit because people should know the truth and I wanted to show my brother (a fellow redditor!) some support. I know this whole thing has taken a big toll on him. That feeling of being betrayed by someone you love is profound. 


My cousins, and now lie to every one of their customers. I recently read an article that one of my cousins wrote (source: [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nate-holzapfel/be-yourself_b_3460777.html](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nate-holzapfel/be-yourself_b_3460777.html) ) about “being the best you” and his first suggestion is to stop chasing other people’s dreams…


Mission Belt says they believe it to be their “corporate responsibility to give something back to hard working individuals, and steal to line their pockets along the way.


For anyone that cares my brother’s company is called Slide Belts and you can check them out at www.SlideBelts.com.

**EDIT:** *I'm glad that many people see that this is just to honor nurses (ER and otherwise) as well as anyone else that works in the medical field.  I'm not looking for a personal thanks to my wife (though they are appreciated!) rather a random thank you to someone you may know or meet that is a nurse.  Others must just have a really boring life to have nothing better to do than complain about a post on a web forum.* 

Throughout my employable life thus far, you could never get me to do the job my wife does every day without complaint.

My wife is an ER nurse.
She is on her feet 12 hours a day, bleeding out after being hit by a drunk driver.  She cries for the 6 month old baby girl brought in, now blue and covered in bruises, that is no longer able to cry.  She comes home from work sometimes in tears for what she sees... sometimes exhausted and in pain from having to perform CPR on a homeless man for 20 minutes...  sometimes traces of blood still on her scrubs from when a sick woman vomited blood all over her while being trached.  She deserves a thousand trophies, a medal, and the utmost respect from the people she saves on a daily basis.

But the reality is, and Depends she changes, there are a dozen people yelling at her for having to sit in the waiting room for that 20 minutes longer while she is frantically pumping the chest of a dying patient because their toe hurts, the coffee is crappy, or ""why did you call me here from the casino and how can you just pick up a 16 year old up with an ambulance without his parents there?!""

I post this to try to bring a little realization to those not aware how important those in your ER are and the type of job it is.  I've always known it is an honorable job, know the work they go through and hope you never have to see the difficult side of the job in a bad situation.  Say 'Thank You', send a card, and never assume your time is more important than someone's life (that's why they have triage).

I see people with ""My son is a Marine"" bumper stickers.  People in the armed forces protecting this country wear a uniform and get people shaking their hands and thanking them for keeping our country safe.  But my wife is just like every other mother walking around the grocery store with a screaming baby on her days off.  Think about that the next time you want to yell at someone for taking too long in line at the deli.  One day on the most vulnerable day in your life that person may be fighting for it when no one else will.  Because it's her job.

So here's my Mom who dropped out of college 25 years ago to start a family, throughout the years has recently failed and disappeared. She has no real resume and few opportunities for work. That was 5 years ago...

Since then she has lost a lot of excess weight, helped plan and execute 3 weddings for her oldest children, attended 3 births and played a big part in the lives of 3 new grandchildren, overcome some big life-threatening medical hurdles, and dealt -the whole time- with the crippling pain of losing her spouse and soul mate.

Two years ago today she got her bachelors degree from a respected private university with a high GPA; an impressive feat for anyone to have accomplished

But today.... *Today she received her Masters degree and is set to launch a new professional career at almost 50 years old!* I saw this all happen over the last five years

My new boss died while I was on vacation, not her name or what she did. Since then, I’ve got to know her some professionally. She was a good boss - lenient when she could be, while expecting results. She bought our team pizza once. When I had a bad cold, she told me to take an extra day off if I had to. She died from “complications from the flu.” Did she take a day off?  

Who dies from the flu these days? The elderly and children. She wasn’t either- she was in good health

So, but she's in the one spot that blocks my car from getting out.

I go at first with the silent approach.  I'll just get in my car, so I back up a little.  Just an inch or so, hoping maybe the motion of my car will draw attention to my reverse lights and she'll move.  Still nothing.  I move another inch, and now I know she's watching me, because she *lays on her horn*.

In light of the silent approach failing, ""You're blocking me in.  Can you just move ten feet back or forward so that I can get to work?""  I'm still being nice and polite here.  However, she replies, ""I'm waiting for my friend to come out.  I'm her ride today.  You think you the only one tryin to get to work today?""  ""Ma'am that's fine but if you could wait for her ten feet back, everything would be fine.""  ""Look motherfucker her apartment is right here and this is where I've been waiting and this is where I'm gonna wait and I'm gonna wait all day if she don't get her ass out here!

As I'm getting in my car

Three months later I'm on my way back from a trip to Florida to visit my wife's parents.  I've forgotten all about the altercation above.  Stopping for gas at an Exxon in South Carolina, almost to the sensor, only to start backing up again at the last second.  The lights are all saying ""Drive Forward"" as in ""Keep pulling up because you haven't hit the sensor yet.""  The sensor was on a tiny ramp that your wheel needs to be resting on top of before the machine starts doing its thing, but for four times now as I watched the Escalade keeps hitting the bump and backing up before being on it.

The fifth time, ""No ma'am you just haven't driven up far enough.""  She closes her door, drives in again, hits the bump, and back up to me again.  Door opens again, ""It ain't working, you gotta move!""  I say again, you keep driving up to it but not on it.  You need to go just a little further.""  At this point another car is behind us, reverse lights come back on.  I shout

I'm literally getting out of my car at this point and about to ground-guide her onto the sensor (hopefully running out of there before the fun begins and I get soaped).  The car behind me is smashing his horn like he's tenderizing a pork chop.  Just as I stand up she yells

Then it hits me.  I look at the car, she slams her door shut, stomps the accelerator, and blasts through the car wash.  She hits the sensor ramp so hard that the left side of the car does a hop through the air.  She speeds right on through, out the other side, and dives into traffic to speed off.

At this point, are staring at the car wash entrance.  Instead of ""Drive Forward"" it now says ""Back Up""",,False,,t5_2qh96,True,,

time of year again

remember last years game of
writing your bra color as your
status?.....or the way we like to
have our handbag handy?
Remember last year so many
people took part that it made
national news and
updating of status reminded
everyone why we're doing this and
helped raise awareness !! Do NOT
tell any males what the status'
mean
please copy and paste (in a
message )this to all your female
friends to see if we can make a
bigger fuss this year than last year!!!
I did my part ... now YOUR turn ! Go
on ladies...and let's have all the
males guessing! .. It's time to
confuse the men again (not that its
really that hard to do :)) Everyone
knows it makes their brains work
wonders on what we're talkin
about!! The idea is to choose the
month you were born and the day
you were born. Pass this on to the
GIRLS ONLY and lets see how far it
reaches around. The last one about
the bra went round all over the
world.
So you'll write ... I' m (your birth
month) weeks and I'm craving (your
birth date)!!! as your status.
Example: Feb 14th: I'm 2 weeks
and craving Chocolate mints!!
January-1 week
March-3 weeks
May-8 weeks
weeks
September-13 weeks

December-18 weeks.
Days of the month: 1-Skittles

23-Gummy Bears

Here's a bit of my story

I've spent my entire life going back and forth between 2 places, trying to do something good, but ran away to my mom's house when I got the opportunity. A couple months passed. Out of a need to get away from parents and be on my own, I took a bus back to the city with no plans. It was stupid, I know. 

I met a lot of interesting and crazy people- people who stole from me, I'd probably have been in a lot of trouble.

I was gifted with a trip to San Francisco by a friend. I was informed less than 12 hours before takeoff that i had a seat, I treated myself to a window seat.

About three hours into the flight, filling my view was an honest to god mountain. A giant mound of various rocks formed through assorted geological phenomena, and it was right there below me. And there was another one by it. And another one. And so many i couldn't count. Wait, no. Theyre all one massive formation. Theres no distinction between one or the other.

Here it goes anyway. I saw a man die today. I was working at my job as a valet this afternoon and some doomed man jumped off our rooftop bar.

I jumped out of the car and in the road was his mangled body

Everyone was just staring, it was over. The practical aspects of running a 5 star hotel which essentially shut down took over and I didn't have the time to digest what happened until an hour or so after the fact. I called my brother to tell him I loved him and broke down crying.

There was a simpler time.  A better time.  When the worst thing that could happen to a girl is that she’d have to fuck Ron Jeremy.  And at least he’d be a gentleman about it.  

80’s porn was great because it represented the kind of sex I actually have.  It was fun.  It was simple.  It wasn’t a test of pain endurance and I didn’t feel like an asshole for watching it.    

And the girls looked like girls.  They had real bodies.  Sure they may have had a little more jelly

Within the last few months I've gotten an amazing full time job

I started off at 230 pounds, which is why it's not going down more -- mostly it's because I don't eat as well as I should thanks to work, and I've been missing the gym some nights. I've been feeling extremely frustrated because the scale isn't going down even though I've been doing so much when I work out.

Two weeks ago, but they fit. Didn't think much of it until I full realized--

I had to wear my work belt with those once tight 14W's yesterday. I had to wear my work belt on the LAST BELT HOLE I HAD LEFT. The 14W's no longer were tight, and not feel like I'm bursting out of it. The resistance on the machines at the gym keep not being enough, so I've been having to make things harder for myself every time I go in. I don't feel like i'm bursting out of my bra now. 

As soon as I realized all that

It's working. I'm getting fit. The weight isn't dropping because it's shifting around, but...

I talked to her over text last week because she seemed upset. She told me her problems and I listened, and had planned on talking to our brother about it when he got back from Guam the next week.

I work at a vet clinic, poor excuse of a kitten. She wanted us (the vet clinic) to care for the kitten until it was""healthy"" and then she wanted it back. She got the kitten from her parent's farm. She was in a litter of barn cats, and for some reason her mother stopped caring for her, would not let her suckle or be groomed. The lady rescued the kitten from the farm, and wanted her as a pet, but couldn't give her the care she required because she had newborn twins at home. The vet explained to her that we dont operate as a foster home, we cannot care for the kitten long term and that the only option would be to surrender her to the SPCA. The lady flat out refused

This is where I piped in. I very hesitantly, she even asked me how much I wanted to be paid per day. Working at a vet hospital, I know how much vet bills for a cat like this can add up, so i told her I did not need to be paid as long as she covered all the expenses. She was absolutely delighted. The lady paid for a feline leukemia test right off the bat, food for a month, and the antibiotics and meds she would need. When I took the kitten out back to be looked at by the vet, the Dr thought I was bringing it back to be euthanized.
     
She could hardly breath out of her stuffed up nose, skin and bone, and anemic from the hundreds of fleas squirming on her. There wasnt much we could do for the fleas because she was so young and weak. She was too young for the Revolution flea treatment. I was sent  home with her, a heating pad, and her meds. I took her home and my roommates were ecstatic about the new arrival. She was so weak all she did was sleep. 

After the first night I talked to the vet and she was suprised the kitten survived the night. We kept up with her meds, but all in all she had a great recovery. She is the most amazing kitten, everyone who meets her falls inlove with her infectious personality. She is still half the size she should be for her age, has upper respiratory problems that will probably never go away. 

Her owner called me regularly for updates, which amounted to $900 (very expensive kitty). She went in, paid the vet bill and then called me back yesterday. My roommates and I have been dreading this call for so long because we knew it meant she was leaving. Everytime I thought of having to give her up it brought tears to my eyes. Then she called me yesterday she said, ""I paid the vet bills, the cats yours"". I couldnt understand what she was saying, my mind was going a million miles a minute. She explained that she heard through the grape vine that I wanted to keep her, and she decided she would give her to me. I wanted her so bad but never would have dreamed of asking because of all the money she put into her. I never could have afforded her vet bills in a million years being a full time student on a budget. 

This lady paid $900 so I could have the most amazing cat in the world. I thanked her a hundred times, we were dreading giving her up. But now shes ours forever. People can surprise you. There are still great people in this world, and I am forever thankful for it.

Except it wasn't. The difference between me and the comic that I just described is that unlike the comic, words, and actions flow, and hurt not only me but the people around me. I'm not sure I was ever able to admit that until now.

Time went on into my Junior year and I decided to fake it: fake happiness into my own life by smiling when I saw people I knew, but being positive to others might create a positive response in themselves. That was the theory, and it seemed reasonable.

Time rolls on and I fake happiness in my social life day in and day out, and people were overall more kind to me in response. It's a good feeling knowing people like you, and I can say that they enjoyed my company as well.

Fast forward a while into mid senior year. things get rough on me. First world problems: relationship strain at home, and other small trivial things put me into another depression state. I decide to stop faking my happiness because I simply felt that I didn't have much of a reason to care about anything.

I was annoyed, and I didn't want to bring any attention to myself. Some friends of mine show up, sit down near me, and talk among themselves and myself about whatever. I'm not doing anything until I'm being talked to by my friend who's brought their attention to me and what do I do? I smile, I sit up, and engage in conversation. That scenario probably happened 5-10 times that day, and the next day, because I'm not faking it at all. This is genuine.

I've learned over time some of the positive effects of being a decent human being, make others and yourself happier as a result. By faking a smile, I've learned to turn it into something genuine.

This account is obviously a throwaway

Not long ago my family was whole. Not perfect mind you, who we'll call R, was the product of my wife's first marriage. R was an infant when I came along and I am the only dad she's ever known. Our arrangement worked out well or seemingly so over the years, and we had three more children together in that time. I have been mommy and daddy to them all at home their entire lives - I cook, clean, do dishes and laundry, I'm the only one who knows how to sew and mend worth a damn so I do, fixing things, window installer and repair expert (people don't know what glazed windows are for some reason)

A bit over a month ago my wife had a major personality shift. She suddenly threw divorce at me, pleading, begging for answers, all of that. We got to a point where we were making plans for a physical separation instead, with her moving out since only one of us wanted it and it wasn't me. The next day she ripped the two oldest out of school and took all 4 straight to the courthouse to file an order of protection against me filled with half-truths and outright lies. The court upheld it at the hearing and I can now only see 3 of my children at a special supervised place, and the 4th not at all.

My children are packed in to the back of a tiny trailer house with another family. My children are in a bad situation and enrolled in a new school district that I know for a fact to be garbage (having been in it myself). She doesn't even watch them, what I did have once went toward my kids needs. Legal aid won't even give me the time of day in spite of my situation being exactly what their paperwork says their primary purpose is. My wife is not paying any of the bills or house payments in spite of the court order requiring her to and I'm losing the house. She's likely not paying life or car insurance either anymore.

I have honestly done nothing to make this situation happen. I'm losing everything and my children are in a dangerous place with a dangerous person hell-bent on hurting me for an unknown reason. My kids need me and my wife is trying to paint a false picture of me as some sort of abusive live-in boyfriend.

I was very angry. I wasn't afraid (for more than the following minutes)... but I was filled with anger and strong feelings for revenge. The smartphone I turned into worthless piece of plastic as soon as I got home through the anti-theft service, I even packed a knife.
But then halfway I thought again

What I discovered is that I'm not ready. I might be in physical terms

(I called the police after I returned home

Well... now I always carry a knife on me when I go out at night. I bought one of those defense keychains with the sharp edges. I'm considering buying a gun

**– Here's the concentration of the bellow comments:** maybe it'll help someone else reading this in the future

* A knife is not a good idea. It can be very dangerous

* If you see a mugger, DO NOT CONFRONT... seriously [DON'T!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ah_0gia4A0)

* I never really understood what was Eminem singing about in his old songs until now! He is a wise man

* Getting self-defense lessons could be a good idea

* A mugger doesn't have a lot of regard to the law or common sense. So don't expect the usual 'rules' between normal people to work with him

* A self-defense flashlight is a very good idea. Effective

* If you're responsible with a gun, but how to control yourself

* Carry a decoy wallet, and put it where people would usually put their wallets

* It really sucks

* When someone at night, 90% of the cars on the street got functional clocks)! The same goes for directions, help, ______ (fill in the blank). Beware and be alert

* Don't walk around with your headphones on or ear-buds in. They block out the environment and you won't hear him sneaking up on you.

1291074169.0,edlf9,I spent this friday night sleeping on a sidewalk in Belfast. This is how it ended.,Wuzzie,746,297,236,"Well first of all

To try and minimize all personal issues with anyone involved (in case my co-workers are redditors). Well

We went as a group from The Republic of Ireland, and not Euro's.)

We arrived at our hostel
Last thing i remember leaving the hostel was: ""-Did everyone write down the address
*psscchh* I have the address plotted in my gps on the phone. No sweat.

So we go out for some pubs and have a good time. Until the time we hit a nightclub
Luckily i had one of the coworkers number, and come back""

Okey. It's not the first time i've been given that advice and made it in at other venues.

So i start to walk around the block and.. wait?
Where was the place again? I was completely lost.
So as i muttered along i asked some guy of the street for a decent pub
But it was a nice pub

An hour later i figured i needed to get myself home
So out i went. It had started to snow even more than the snow that was earlier. And the frosty wind had picked up.

Everything looked the same. First visit in Belfast

Only thing is that my battery was dead. Since my fancy touchscreen phone had all the gps

I couldn't even call my friend. 

Starting to get a bit worried. It's now about 3am on saturday morning.
I checked my pockets. Great. No more pounds. Only euros. And i had no money on my visa. 

As i started to ask the cabdrivers for direction it was like tossing a dice. 
""-You're almost there mate
""-Have no clue.""
""-It's not far.. About 20 minutes walk back the way you came.""
And the story was the same. No one took me along

At one point i even got so desperate that i was thinking of starting to make such nuisence that i atleast could sleep in a cell for the night. But i didn't see a single police officer all night.

As i was walking in yet a direction given to me by a cabdriver

I asked him for directions

As we got to the hotel

""-Come on. I'll show you. You can sleep at my place. No bother.""

So as we walk along through the streets
""-Ah sh.. Come on! Time for some shoppin' lad!""
And we came to what i can only presume to be a home-less shelter. Because He was apparently well known by the staff. And they were not pleased about him trying to get a bed at 4:30 in the morning. And especially not bringing guests... ;)

So we got ourselves one big blanket each and was sent on our way.
I'm usually quite a freezing guy. And i can get picky with how warm i want my room. But as we sat down and leaned towards the delivery-entrance to this store i just didn't care. Yes the concrete was freezing cold

As i woke up a few hours later

""-Time for coffee lad. You seem to need it. I'm buyin'!""
So he bought me a cup of coffee

In general i hardly ever give money to beggars or homeless people just to prevent this. I do give money to organizations regularly.

As he later guided me to the nearest post-office (i still only had euros) the staff looked at us like poisoned rats. But as i picked up my wallet and started to dab with my euro-notes

As i was done
""-Got some money over.. And i thought we both needed gloves in this weather."" Spot on Tommy. I was freezing solid.

He then guided me to a taxi-rank

The taxidriver then started to question me why i was hanging out with a guy like Tommy. ""-He's a homeless guy

""-Well

I paid the cabbie and got into my hostel. It was basically just around the corner from where i had spent the night. I had a long warm shower

Sometimes i guess you just have to trust people. Even if they are homeless and don't have fancy phones

**TL;DR:** I got lost in Belfast and a homeless person helped me.

Prior to my freshman year in college, hop in, soap up the cheeks (and in between), rinse, soap up, rinse off, step out, apply cream to the cheeks and in between (again, rinse off (making sure no cream touches the genitals), towel dry

Fast forward to my freshman year in college: I had stocked up on the Nair lotion when shopping for school, and that the necessary application times would be somewhat similar to those in the NFMBC. And for whatever strange, idiotic reason, I decided not to even glance at the suggested application times on the pink Nair bottle, somehow equating in my head this relationship: 

Nair for Men=super strong formula to remove ungodly body hair of burly man.

Nair for Women=dainty little feminine cream to lift off whimpy little peach fuzz...


**BIGGEST. FUCKING. MISTAKE. EVER.**


Turns out, as opposed to the men's version, which is 8-10 minutes.

So there I am (in an individual shower in the community bathroom on my floor), and so far, everything had gone as per usual as though it had been the NFMBC. Smooth sailing. Then I thought to myself, *""Well, since this pussy shit is in a pink bottle and it's for women, might as well leave this shit on a little longer than normal to make sure I don't have to repeat the whole process again.""* 

*Five minutes later*

**SWEET MOTHER FUCK COCK SHIT ASS BITCH FUCK SHIT FUCK FUCK FUCK**

It crept up on me like a thief in the night. There I was, when the skin in and around my ass, ass-cheeks and genitals was lit on fire. Folks, this was the single most intense, painful, horrifyingly painful sensation I had ever experienced. After shrieking in horror, I immediately about-faced the shower head

**SHIT MOTHER FUCK ASS NIGGER CALCULUS MOTHER FUCKING SHIT SHIT FUCK**

Folks, I was probably in the shower from around 7:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m., and most of the guys on my floor were eating in the cafeteria), but once the water hit, I lost awareness of the outside world, and the inner foul-mouthed-banshee within me surfaced. A few people came in and out of the bathroom during that time, a couple people were immensely curious as to what was going on with the random shrieker in shower four, ""I'M FINE!""

It took me about half an hour to muster up what little strength I had left to rinse off the remaining Nair, soap up, rinse, and rinse until I was positive that every last molecule of Nair lotion had been removed from my skin. I turned off the water, and the most excruciatingly sharp pain set in in and around my ass/ass cheeks, and I began to cry softly to myself.

So there I was, flesh as raw as it could be (no bleeding), crying, ready to drink my own piss. Once I finally mustered up the courage to wrap a towel around my waist, the fabric hit my skin, and I knew that I was in for the most painful two weeks of my life. Taking shits and wiping my ass would become a time consuming task of monumental proportions, seeing that I would only be able to wad up the toilet paper and gently dab between my cheeks - wiping was out of the question. And as for sitting down on any surface - I don't want you to imagine the pain I had to endure every time I sat in class. Sleeping? A thing of the past. Even though I typically slept on my side, a sharp pain radiated throughout my body

Oh

*The normal pubes.* 

But hey

**TL;DR**: Used the Nair for Men without so much as a hiccup

EDIT: I was fine after a month or two. The redness went away after a couple weeks of cortizone applications. You can bet your ass off that I read every damn word on that tube.

And I would like to take this opportunity to apologize for using the N-word. I love members of all races

Where to start – well, his father, had abused her, just so she could hurt him, claimed that the cliff and forests walks that he used to take us on were horrible and scary and that she hated every minute of them. She claimed he hit her when he didn’t, called the cops on him. Badgered, berated and tormented him till the only escape he had was drink

She got pregnant and claimed that the guy raped her – he hadn’t. She had the baby but has pretty much abandoned him now he is ten and is looked after by us. She won’t let him see his father.

She drove her most recent boyfriend to commit suicide. He was a married man with 5 kids. She seduced him because he was very wealthy. She got pregnant quickly and then again straight after so she could trap him. She manipulated him into putting her name alongside his in the new house that he bought. He realised his mistake and tried to go back to his wife. His wife wouldn’t have him while she had half the new house. He tried everything he could to get her to sign it back to him. I won’t go into too many more details but of course she wouldn’t and in the end he committed suicide. He called her a cockroach before the end.

The list goes on and on, a victim that she can torture and abuse and manipulate. Now that her boyfriend is dead and she has his house her latest target seems to be my mother. She tries to make her feel guilty tries to make her feel sympathy tries to get her on her own and cut the rest of us off. When she is on her own she is her pawn.

I believe my mother wants to cut all ties with her but just doesn’t seem able. She tends to fall back on the – ‘but she is my daughter’ line. I don’t really know what to do about it. A small circle of people know what my sister is, convince and manipulate people into doing and believing whatever she wants.  She is very, very charming when she wants to be. She has eyes that seem to pierce into your soul – they are like the eyes of a reptile, I can’t hold them for long – an intelligent reptile I think that’s what she is – or as he said – a cockroach.

 I feel like she is invincible. I don’t know what to do.

**TL;DR Wife died, forget about price match from budget and gave us a death trap of a vehicle**

I had 1 day to go through my wife's belongings and pack myself to move.  Uhaul made this terrible circumstance even worse.  

I originally rented from Budget, the one I got from budget had a small cab and I have long legs.  So I called the uhaul place he suggested.  Over the phone I told them what I had already rented from Budget, I went over my costs and I was assured a price match.  They told me the 20' truck is the replacement for what I got.  I went over my entire bill, included in my budget bill was the furniture pads, hand truck, unlimited miles and I paid ahead for 5 extra days.  I told them I wanted a newer truck, I am traveling 1600 miles, I said are you absolutely sure because I will cancel the budget truck and I need a truck today

I get a call an hour later and have been told my truck is ready, I told him thats not what I ordered, he said oh we gave you a FREE upgrade!  I told him I wanted the 20' that I was guaranteed, I don't want a truck that big and pay the extra gas for nothing.  I call back and they find me a 20' truck - already wasting precious packing time.  I am told a 20' truck will be available at 4pm, I said as long as it is everything I requested for the quoted price, I was again assured so.  I wait and get a call, a 20' is available.  I go pick it up, I ask to see the truck first, I said I still want to see it, the cab is smaller

The uHaul guy started ringing me up.  The price was already off by about $100, I got upset, those were included in the price match.  But I let it pass, I had to go home and pack.  Then after everything is done, he said the truck is due back by the 25th, I said NO, I rented it until the 29th.  I was informed it would be $40 a day extra, this is not my price match from budget, you need to fix this, but this is too much.  He ""Acted"" like he ""Texted"" corporate and told me so

I finally get back to CT and drop off the truck, but nothing can be done about the price match, that had to be done at the time of pick up.  I was able to get the extra days knocked off, so I had to wait for that to be fixed, so another wait while the drop off place called corporate to see what could be done.  I am so disappointed with Uhaul, this is the worst experience with a company I have ever had. 

**EDIT/UPDATE** Thank you all for your responses, I just heard back via Facebook.  Looks like I am making progress, no resolution, but a voice at least.  

**U-Haul Leo

I emailed them right away

**Update #2**  I got a call from an Allison from UHaul, she asked if there is any more info, I said read the reddit post, that has about everything.  She assured me I will hear back from uHaul in 24-48 hours after they review everything and I have her direct line to call back.  So no resolution yet, but contact is good.

**EDIT**  I created a youtube video to spread the word

**Edit**. Thank you all for all your comments and support.  I lost power last night with the high winds, I am waiting for uhaul to call me back.  I am heading out to charge my phone, hopefully I will hear from them today,  I will surely keep you all updated.  Also, sorry for the low audio on the video below, I'll try to speak into the mic on the update video :)

**UPDATE AND RESOLUTION**  I can not thank you all enough, he offered his apologies, I was given $250 back but most important I made sure a complaint was waged against the Naples Uhaul and he said they will be reviewing that location so no other trucks leave like that again.  You know as well as me that probably not much will happen, but there is hope that maybe this will stop at least a few people from going through the horror that we did.  The $250 does help.  So I thank you all again!",,False,,1359729425.0,t3_17kb4d

We basically stopped communicating a few weeks after she moved. She was busy with her own life and I didn't want to pathetically try to grasp onto something which clearly wasn't going to work given the circumstances. I would've liked to have kept *some* contact

Well 2 years later I was still convinced we were ""soul mates"" and that I would never meet anyone I clicked with as well as her. I was still having dreams about her. I felt like I couldn't even be open to dating any other girl because she would never measure up to my ""dream girl"". Every new girl I met would undergo the comparison test and almost immediately fail. I knew this wasn't right but I didn't know what  to do to move on. I basically just lay dormant and hoped for the best. I thought that time was all it would take for me to heal. I had heard this said over and over again

I realized this about three months ago when I read about how people sometimes have idealized fantasy versions of other people in their heads. I had known about this and had even thought before that I was probably doing it to some degree with this girl, I felt like I could move forward for the first time in two years. I felt free. I can't express how liberating this revelation was for me.

I have no idea if we would've been a good match in a relationship. It never got that far. That doesn't mean we couldn't possibly have been a good match, or buts. I just knew it. It's quite a humbling experience to look back on how sure I was of something for two years that I now know was almost entirely complete bull shit. It makes me question other things that I'm still so ""sure"" of about the world, and how closely my vision of the world aligns with the actual world.

I feel like I've just awoken from a two-year coma. This is not to say that none of the heartache or feelings I felt were based in reality

I wanted to share this because I really hope someone else who is in the same type of situation I was will read it and possibly have a light turn on in their head as well. I wish I had considered this idea seriously a lot sooner. Because I'm finally excited about meeting new people and forming new relationships again.

I am a skinny guy, I decided to kayak out to a nearby beach and spend an hour or so snorkeling and diving with the fishes. I grabbed my mask and snorkel as well as some water and headed for the beach in the 11:00 AM white heat of the sun with my kayak balanced on my head.

Forty-five minutes later, swashy movements while balancing precariously on my simple little craft. There were some twenty people on the small beach, an abnormally large crowd. As I drifted towards the beach I passed two young highschool-football-sized guys splashing around in the waist high waves.

I beached my kayak, which is help in Spanish.

My Spanish is terrible

""Ayuda!"" He and his buddy seemed to be heading out farther to sea.

""En serio?""

He must have detected my terrible Spanish, so he switched to panicked English.

""Help! I no swim!""

That's when he slipped under water taking an audible mouthful of water with him. He came back up for a second, yelled ""Help!"" I still kind of thought they were joking. The first guy, though, who was closer to me, was spending a lot of time under.

With my mask and snorkel still in hand

As soon as I was near the guy who was worse off

They were both still shouting ""Help!"" over and over, too.

I dropped my mask &amp; snorkel, oddly enough, really embarrassing.

I must have said something along the lines of ""I need to help your friend, but no good."" He then continued to shout ""Help!"" and ""Ayuda!"" alternately until finally some guy on the beach stood up and began walking towards us - slowly.

At this point we're just twenty or so yards away from the beach

The guy who's attached to me says ""We can stand

He stood on the beach for a second throwing up some water.

The other guy - and the one helping him - make it to the beach a moment later. The two near drowning guys stand around a little bit dazed for a moment

A lot of people were staring at me from the beach. There were a few pretty girls but their mildly startled

I looked for my mask and snorkel in vain for some fifteen minutes. I felt really ridiculous, too. Looking around, I thought for a second that maybe I could ask someone to borrow some, but I felt a little too embarrassed to.

I still had to kayak back home - forty-five minutes in which I would certainly burn to a crisp.

I was cycling from the local train station to my office, and unable to contact any of my family - who live 40 miles away, - I called an ambulance.

I was bleeding heavily from my arm, shoulder and hands; my knees were excruciatingly painful, and I thought I'd broken a rib. Moreover, I couldn't walk. It took all my energy to move myself and my bike off the road to the sidewalk.

The important part: When the ambulance arrived, what possessed you to call 999 [UK]? Why on earth would you think this is a job for paramedics?' I was pretty shocked; I couldn't walk, I was on the verge of passing out, covered in blood and in a lot of pain.

After cleaning my injuries, other than to dully apologise.

It eventually transpired that I was alright; no broken bones, but then I remember that I couldn't walk at all, and was bleeding a lot.

What should I have done instead? Did I do the right thing?

**TLDR: Got shouted at by a paramedic for an 'inappropriate' callout after being thrown off my bike; bleeding heavily and unable to walk. Did I do the right thing in calling?**

I was not at work when it happened, so worker's compensation wasn't an option for covering it. Past that, I do not have health insurance.

*  Scowl

*  Tell your wife that you’ll be nicer to her if she would keep all bathroom products, removing them only for the purposes of bathing and returning them immediately thereafter. Become angry when your wife sincerely asks if you are joking.

*  Make no moves on your wife except when she’s sleeping. Accuse her of rejecting you when she doesn’t wake up. (Wife must be a deep sleeper for this one to work).

*  Leave her two weeks before her bar exam because she’s not spending enough time with you. Make sure she knows that you are extremely hurt by her lack of attention and that you find it unacceptable.

*  Deliberately mow down the garden she spent all spring planting.

*  Watch porn every night. Express your irritation when she asks you to maybe cut it back somewhat.

*  Move into the guest bedroom without explanation. Thereafter

*  Start going to the gym. Soon increase your visits to twice a day. Drink heavy volumes of protein shakes

*  Facilitate a co-dependent relationship with your domineering mother. When in conflict

*  Frequently voice your opinion that your wife is a slob. Point to a pair of shoes near her closet door and a newspaper on the dining room table as unequivocal proof. Tell her you just can't take it anymore.

*  If your wife asks for a Hilti hammer drill for her birthday, loudly refer to your wife as “high-maintenance” to your brother; don’t elaborate, just shake your head.

*  Accuse your wife of feigning illness to avoid sex. Express your suspicion that your wife’s fever and prescription for antibiotics was obtained under false pretenses in an effort to cover up her elaborate scheme.

Detect muffled sounds of laughter immediately before observing some of your personal effects before thrown from an upper balcony.


**EDIT:** I should note a couple of things after seeing all the comments. 

(1) **Behavior Before Marriage.** While we dated he was not, my family, friends, even HIS friends: everyone were completely blindsided by the 180. He was a laid back software developer for chrissakes. At least when I married him. Could you look back and say, ""Hmmm, X was a sign?"" Maybe. Just as much as you can look at a serial killer and say, ""He threw crabs into a boiling pot of water! We should have known!"" Everyone who knows me &amp; him would probably agree there really weren't any signs that anyone but a psychic could discern. A couple of shrinks have since diagnosed him as a clinical sociopath (among other problems) and believe that he was unusually skilled at hiding his true self. Me: ""Obviously."" Him: ""Yeah

(2) **About Me.** I'm a good person, and  pretty happy. I'm not, contrary to some, ahem, suggestions, a douche myself. Being self-aware enough to know you're attractive, intelligent

(3) **Sorry, I do agree there maybe were things I could have done differently that may have helped minimize his behavior, that maybe I could have listened better or been more attentive at times or any number things. But he would tell you it wouldn't have made a difference in the end. He admits now he would have done pretty much anything to destroy the marriage. He was (and probably still is) a diagnosed psychopath, end of story. I could have been June fucking Cleaver and he would have hated me anyway. No, I'm certainly not perfect. Far from it. But I didn't deserve even a fraction of what he did to me. 

(4) **But Ok So I'm the Douche?** 

And sure, intelligent, cool, and (OH MY FUCKING GOD) suggestions in the post that perhaps I live an otherwise pretty charmed life. As long as you have the simultaneous understanding that the existence of those traits is precisely what makes his behavior all the more psychotic. If I turned into an unattractive dumb bitch (pardon the phrase, but it is after all the opposite), then *maybe* you could excuse *some* of it. Maybe. Like the porn consumption. Or trying to get laid in the pitch black. I mean, let's get real, is a meanie

I would say so too because I have nothing against it and will support my opinion with the equal rights BS. 

But when questions about homosexuality is asked as a self-evaluation like you're actually asking yourself whether you support gay marriage

I have a feeling, this is your right, I would totally support my child if he/she is gay, etc.

I'm going to come clean to the Reddit community. It's difficult for me to accept homosexuality. If my son is gay

I certainly hope that gay people can find their way into acceptance

***EDIT***
I agree that I do have something against homosexuality. If I didn't

It's important to understand where my dislike for homosexuality comes from, we are both evasive and scared. I had lived with that attitude until I got into college when I started meeting homosexuals. 

Superficially, the image of buggary appears in my mind. I'm not enemies with them either. I just don't talk to them much. I am fine with the second group; in fact, some of my very good friends belong to this group.

I tell people of both of these groups the truth - that even though I would support gay equality like gay marriage

I've come a long way to where I stand in the subject of homosexuality. When I was a freshman

And returning to the original purpose of starting this thread: I suspect there are an abundance of people who are like me. They claim they have nothing against gay people; they would vote for Proposition 8 and go to gay parties for fun. They also deny that they wouldn't say anything against their children if they turned out to be gay. But when the problem of homosexuality hits them right in the face

It got to the point where it was painfully obvious that we both liked each other, especially since I'm a little older that this isn't the way it normally happens.   
I can't really picture how dating strangers would work though. So you randomly meet someone and you have a conversation and you get their number. Okay. Then what? How long do you wait to send them a text? What would you even talk about over text? My text conversations usually end up being very brief and impersonal.    
So that's one problem. I guess the next step is at some point you'll set up a date. You go out for some drinks or whatever

On 2010-05-25 I purchased a Barnes &amp; Noble (hereafter referred to as ""B&amp;N"") 3G nook (serial number XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-0039)

On 2010-10-02 I purchased a Barnes &amp; Noble WiFi nook (serial number XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-0052) for myself

**2011-01-05:**
I visited the Barnes &amp; Noble store in Layton

I called B&amp;N at their support phone number (1-800-THE-BOOK) and spoke with a representative after about a 30 minutes wait time.  I explained the crack on the defective 3G nook. She requested, date of purchase for the 3G nook, my address, the last four digits of the credit card on my B&amp;N account. The representative responded stating that I should receive a confirmation email within 4-24 hours concerning the shipment of the replacement 3G nook.

**2011-01-07:**
I received no confirmation emails within the stated 4-24 hours. After about 48 hours I called the B&amp;N support phone number and spoke with a representative after about 25 minutes on hold. This representative told me that their department does not handle nook concerns

After being on hold for another 25-30 minutes, apologized for mix up, hold times and lack of customer service. He further explained that the 3G nook was not in one of their systems, regardless of the fact that it is identified on their website under devices I have registered with B&amp;N. Quentin assured me he would take care of everything, make sure the device is shipped, and would call me back within 24 hours regardless of whether it had been shipped, just to update me of the status. Furthermore

**2011-01-09:**
After receiving no confirmation call form Quentin or other B&amp;N staff

The representative told me I would receive three emails (one with an RMA number

**2011-01-13:**
After four days I called B&amp;N support phone number because I had not received neither the replacement 3G nook or the email confirming the shipment and tracking of the replacement 3G nook. The representative had no clue what was happening but I was given a UPS tracking number (1ZA4928A9091837531). The tracking details on the UPS website states ""A label for this shipment has been created

At this point it seemed the B&amp;N phone support group could not provide any help, and explained the situation.  Jamie, a digital products manager at the store returned my call and assured me, that although the store could not provide direct help, she would make calls to B&amp;N phone support on my behalf an escalate the problem. Jamie called me several times throughout the evening to get information and keep me up-to-date as she was speaking to B&amp;N phone support. Jamie told me that I should be receiving a call from B&amp;N phone support within the next day or so and if I had not I should call her back on Monday (2011-01-17).

**2011-01-17:**
I received no call form B&amp;N. Jamie called B&amp;N for me again and spoke to Richard at B&amp;N phone support. B&amp;N extended the original 14 days to 21 days for the credit card charge.  Jamie explained to me that B&amp;N sent out a replacement WiFi nook for the deregistered WiFi nook (!!) and not one for the 3G nook even though I never inquired about the WiFi nook

Jamie gave me RMA number XX738 for 3G nook and RMA XX320 for the WiFi nook. Jamie was informed by B&amp;N phone support and subsequently told me that I should either reject the UPS shipment of the mistaken replacement WiFi nook or use the pre-paid UPS label that was emailed to me to send the replacement WiFi nook back.

Jamie told me I would have to call B&amp;N phone support to start the process over again for the 3G nook. Jamie told me I should ask for Richard when I called.

I called B&amp;N phone support and asked for Richard. The representative

Again, UPS shipment confirmation and tracking number). Adrian told me to call back the next day if I did not receive all the emails.

**2011-01-19:**
Again

I called B&amp;N phone support and talked with representative Melvin. He was very confused. I asked if the 3G nook had been shipped and Melvin gave me UPS tracking number 1ZA4928A9094011211 for the 3G nook. Since Melvin was very confused and giving me conflicting information

Wee told me that Adrian requested express shipping. Wee told me there is no tracking number for the 3G. I asked him three separate times if he was sure there was no UPS tracking number. He again responded that there was no tracking number. I asked him why did Melvin give me a tracking number and if he just made it up. ""Probably"" was his answer. He stated the 3G nook replacement will ship out on 2010-01-21.

***Amazon:***
I bought a Kindle. The power button failed to work on 2011-01-03. I called Amazon at 10:30pm 2011-01-03 with no wait time and I received a replacement on 2011-01-05. The screen on the replacement Kindle failed to refresh properly. I called Amazon on 2011-01-10 and I received a replacement the very next day (2011-01-11).

**Husband:** Well that changes everything. 

**Geezer:** I thought so. 

**Husband:** {to me, you had no idea. Really, no idea at all?* {to geezer} You recorded my wife without her knowledge. So now I get to report you and your tape to ** *my FBI son* ** and he’s going to nail you and your dipshit *attorney* son on federal wiretapping charges.

**Husband:** And he doesn't have a district attorney son. Fake FBI son trumps fake DA son. He won’t be pulling out that line on anyone else anytime soon.
 

Another call came from a kindly farmer in Southern Indiana, in part because of traffic, but more so because he knew one half of Chicago to be populated by menacing gangbangers and the other half comprised of Mad Maxians, ready to jump him for the pure sport of it.

**Farmer:** Sounds like a good truck. 

**Husband:** It is a good truck. 

**Farmer:** Sure would like to see it. Course ain’t sure I’m wanting to go into that city traffic. Don’t want to run into no trouble up there neither.
 
**Husband:** Tell you what, Tinley Park, I promise you that.

A few weeks after Mitchell and I started dating, I’d begun to feel better and much more stable.  However, on getting this news, hurting myself immediately felt like the best way to fix the problem.  Then I realized I’d also have to tell Mitchell and was scared that he would freak out and would no longer be interested, then I would have lost him and that I would have to go through this alone.  Instead, I told him and we sat on my couch and he held me as I sobbed and tried to explain what little I understood at the situation, what was likely to happen, I must have gotten HPV while cheating on him.

That was about three years ago and since then I’ve gone through a dozen or so outpatient procedures, driving me to my appointments whenever he can, taking care of me after a procedure, holding me when I get bad news, and celebrating with me on the few occasions I heard good news.  In between all of this, we’ve had a lot of fun together, taken a few trips, cooked a lot of amazing dinners

I found out yesterday that my most recent test results showed signs of low-grade SIL or mild displasia.  Since the previous lab report had come back negative (no problems), he held me as I cried. 

I don’t yet know what the next step is going to be but Mitchell seems committed to staying with me and helping however he can.  I told him that I could not have made it this far without him but I don’t think he believes me.  I hope that he reads this and knows how much I appreciate him.

I'm one of the 'active' partners in a family business - meaning the other owners/partners have retired and I'm left to deal with the day to day operations

About 11 am, and shot herself.  The first indication our employee had was the police screaming up to the entry gate and yelling for entrance.  No one actually heard the gunshot.  Police and paramedics found the body on site, in a remote part of the building.  I assume resuscitation was attempted and all that, but was at this point just getting phone updates.

About 2 pm, all the paramedics do is drape a sheet over the worst of it.

I'm well aware there are probably outfits around specializing in this type of clean up situation, due to the nature of our business - cleanup needed to happen immediately.  We really can not just shut down and wait.

So, I'll have to call somebody.""

I stop at the hardware store and go all Breaking Bad in there: 5 Gallon Bucket, chemical gloves, etc.

I get to the site

Gets weird(er) here:  I put on my radio to give me some distraction before getting to work and immediately the first song is Blue Rodeo's ""All the Things Left Behind"" - which was crazy to listen too standing in that room.  Mind is going to some deep

I suck it up and get down to business and get the place cleaned up - pretty damn well if I say so myself.  I've told my wife and kids I should now be addressed as ""Wolf"" or ""Mr. Wolf"" (from Pulp Fiction).

I honestly don't have a lot feeling one way or the other about it, but ultimately she chose a way out that kept the messiness away from them, but dropped it squarely at my doorstep to deal with.

We did get a phone call from cleaning specialist while I was in there working.  They ball parked $ 1

Well a few weeks ago

We just completely hit it off. Talking to her it was like I had known her my whole life. we have the same values and outlook on life and it was just amazing to talk to and connect with someone in that way when I've basically been a hermit for the past two years and lost many of my friends due to depression and being a recluse. 

tonight we had our first date and it was like we didn't skip a beat. There was no awkwardness or uncomfortable silences

I still can't believe it's happening. like what does she see in me? but I'm trying really hard to not let those insecurities get in the way of whatever happens. 

this may not seem like a big deal to most people but feeling connected to someone after feeling so alone for so long just sparked a wee bit of warmth back into this tired

1311264422.0,ivx9x,I was bartending at a Ruby Tuesday until this morning. This is the 'quit letter' I sent to corporate.,jerseyfresh,905,493,408,"To Whom It May Concern:

I have been part of the Ruby Tuesday’s team for about a month, I just want to say how much I appreciate the management team at this location. Bonnie, Mike, Nick, and Carlos care about this company, and strive every day to deliver on this brand’s promise. They regularly interact with customers in a warm, friendly manner; they treat the staff with a fairness that goes beyond what is required. My only reservations about leaving arise when I think about the predicament my sudden absence will cause them

I am leaving because I don’t make nearly enough money, I know because I was forced to sign a piece of paper acknowledging this fact. This decision alone has effectively gutted the day shift for bartenders at our location. Last week I made $8 on one 6 hour day shift, $17 on another, and $30 on another (you can imagine how happy I was on the $30 day). Let me ask you, could you live on $8 a day? These poor paying shifts are the norm, not the exception. So if by some freak occurrence I could make $50 on a day shift, I’d have to average that out with the $8 shifts as well - handicapping my hours

Another grievance is with the TueGo, take TueGo orders, and still find the time to serve the bar guests with the standard that they have come to expect from Ruby Tuesdays? I understand that you want to save the $3/hr by consolidating as many jobs as possible, but even the guests can see how ridiculous it is to have their bartender spend countless minutes on the phone in the middle of the dinner rush.

Also, I get the “indirect tips” which I earn from service bar in my paycheck. Here are some numbers: For 37.67 hours, I earned $72.39 in indirect tips ($1.92/hr); For 40 hours I earned $77.03 in indirect tips ($1.93/hr); For 38.53 hours I earned $87.82 in indirect tips($2.28/hr). Let me ask you this, do you think $2 an hour is a fair price for the amount of drinks that go out to the customers, from flavored teas, to mojitos, to martinis, and although I may make dozens of drinks in an hour

As far as my total tips go (direct+indirect), I barely break $10/hr in total, pre-taxed income. Do you think those are decent earnings for a bartender? In my experience outside of Ruby’s, bartenders typically earn more than servers - and with good reason. At our restaurant this is not even close to being true, and perhaps this should be the most obvious indication that something is awry regarding the bar.

Each of these decisions regarding the bar may not be such a big deal on their own, and an experienced bartender can make all the difference when it really counts.

I wonder if any of the ‘decision makers’ have ever worked inside of a restaurant, to actually work a week at my location and then tell me it’s better than getting tipped out every night. I challenge anyone who thinks taking TueGo orders when the bar is full and the service bar is calling to work a week behind the bar and then tell me it makes sense. 

For a company that invests so much in training it’s employees

Sincerely
Jerseyfresh
Ruby Tuesday of Toms River

1357744297.0,1691ro,Just finished 6 months of job probation - here's what I learned,throwaway1980guy,554,148,117,"I've worked for over 6 years as an IT guy at a higher ed institution.  Six months ago

Apparently, as well as e-mails of my director checking in and following up on things and his ""good job, thanks for taking care of that"" e-mail.  

I wasn't allowed to.  I wasn't given any opportunity to defend myself, ""Perception equals reality"", and if someone has the perception that something is wrong, then it needs to be fixed.

Instead of being fired, regular performance evaluations, and a written plan of action.  

Probation ended at the calendar year mark and I had my last meeting to discuss things yesterday.  Everything wrapped up nicely with everyone patting me on the back, and my improvements to customer service.  The thing is, I didn't actually improve any of these things - in fact, they're worse than ever.  So how did I come out shining?

Simple:  I stopped putting myself out there.  I care deeply about my job and the work I do.  I love the people, I love the opportunities for innovation and collaboration.  While I was on probation, though, my focus was on being as small and unseen as possible.  I stopped volunteering for things.  I deferred work orders back to the Tier 1 helpdesk and offered some guidance toward a solution.  Faculty and staff that used to call me directly learned to call the main line after I would direct them there before taking on their issues.  I put a wall up around me and did just enough work to not look like an asshole during my weekly meetings.

As a result, and in the minds of my superiors, that's a good thing.  Last year, I developed a custom imaging solution that provided zero-touch system imaging using WIM files that changed the face of how we deploy systems and update labs (even got to present it at a national lab manager conference).  I walked us through a major vendor change that got us better hardware and saved us $80,000 that year alone with an additional $80K each year for the next two years.  I got smiles and waves from faculty as I walked around campus.

This year was different.  There were no solutions, no vendor talks or negotiations to save us money, nothing but putting fires out and keeping my head down... and my director couldn't be happier.

Now that probation is over

The main thing I learned during my probation is that when a department, then you wind up with employees whose **only** focus is on managing perception.

----

**EDIT** - Just wanted to answer one really common question:  ""Why don't you start looking elsewhere?""  Well

First of all, though, I love the area I'm working in, and there just isn't a lot of tech out here.  I don't want to move and the prospect of getting a similar job without relocating is pretty nil.  Also, I really do love the work I do and my coworkers are almost like family.  I have plenty of reasons to stay and only this political BS from my director as a reason to leave.  Maybe I will in time, but I'm not dusting off my suitcases just yet.

As far as the question, but will also ALWAYS keep the perception of myself and my job in the back of my mind.",,False,,t5_2qh96,1357753868.0,,

All my posts hit the spam filter of every single subreddit I post in. This is proven on several accounts

If you check my comment and post history

Silent bans are used to throw off spammers. What happens when you are silently banned is your posts only appear to you and moderators. Moderators have to manually allow your posts through. [This](http://i.imgur.com/sTwnQ.png) is a test post in a subreddit I made to illustrate this phenomena. All my links, site-wide.

More proof? A mod at /r/gamingpc [discovered my situation](http://i.imgur.com/PQwqO.png) yesterday. Excluding mod saves like yesterday, or replied to in [A whole month](http://i.imgur.com/5beV6.png)

So I can safely assume I have been silently banned for a whole month.

I went in with ZERO expectations of scoring or doing anything special and just ran and played within myself.  I tried my best to find open spots on offense

I made a dumb turnover though.  I grabbed a rebound, but in my excitement, I traveled.  It's funny now thinking about it, but I was *devastated* at the time.

The details:  I was a lock-and-key kid.  After school I would walk home and stay in the house with my sibling until my parents got home.  During the summer, pleasant, and generally quiet.  He would wait until my brother had gone out to play with his grandsons and then start with me.  He was never violent.  He would take me into the bathroom and expose himself and give me directions on what to do.  I remember most of it vividly, and I remember it being surreal and dream-like.  I had no real emotional response or fear, because I had no idea what was going on.  I just followed directions.  This occurred more times than I can remember during the summer when I was 7 and 8.  I was a strong girl, and although I had learned somewhere along the lines what was appropriate and inappropriate, I didn't really connect the dots here, and I was not the first or last.

This pretty much came out of no where. He has gotten so insane, but I'm getting ahead of myself.

It started Wednesday two days ago from this post.(not going to use real names for this) The person in question,efficient at his job, 31( I think), wife, young kid, seemed normal the whole time I have known him. Even has a decent sense of humor, easy going

About 8:30am My buddy, talking about opening portals to other dimensions or some shit, and its his mission to ""save"" as many of us as he can. Of course I didnt believe him, or thought that Matt was joking. My backup supervisor then says how he also thought Matt was joking so he started laughing at him, and Matt got totally furious with him.

I still thought he misunderstood something that Matt said, he said hes gonna ""save"" all of us'. Sure enough, about 15 minutes later, he wanders over to me, looks around to make sure no ones around. This is one of the weirdest conversations of my life, I had some warning at least, I'll try to get it right. I had some warning this conversation was coming, remembering how he apparently flipped out when he was laughed at.

Matt ""Hey... you have some... Interesting Facebook friends...(Matt isnt on my face book
Me: ""Who are you talking about?""

At this point he looks confused

Matt:""It was Richard."" (I dont know any Richards

Matt:""It doesn't matter
Me:""Help me how...?""

Matt ""In two years, but we need one more person to complete the circle, once we have the last, we just need to find a small animal for the sacrifice. The Ritual is this weekend""(Red flags are going up in my brain right here)

At this point I'm a bit stunned, even as a joke) He stares back with a blank expression. 

So

Me ""I don't really believe in that stuff.."".-he interrupts me

Matt ""You NEED to just believe!""

Me "" I cant.""

And then

""Then you'll burn."" And walks off.

He then went around talking to everyone else, who basically told him, ""Believe whatever you want,but leave me the fuck out of it"" Though there was a few certain people he told couldn't join, because they were ""un-saveable and tainted"". 

From there, comes back to bite me in the ass,since I was the only one who fully heard him out, he decided I was his best bet at conversion or whatever.

Around, and shoves a folded paper into my hand, I only have time to say ""What-"" but he didnt even miss a step, and keep on going without looking back.

Shit, this is what it said, printed in pencil.

Join us.
We need you to complete the circle

PS

What the fuck.

The rest of Wednesday goes by without much incident, myself one of them.

And then comes today(thursday). Shit goes to a whole new level of WTF

So I'm looking over my list, written in pencil and all caps, **JOIN US**

For fucks sakes, literally. I was talking to a coworker, and hes all like ""Dude, do not fucking turn around, hes giving us the stare""

So we just make small talk for a few minutes

This happened several more times that fucking hour. And the next. 

Then shit gets real, ask what the fuck that was about.

It was his wife, and he wouldn't talk to her.

Shortly before lunch, yet again, is poorly hiding behind some objects watching us. So Its like, enough of this, I go over to him, and hes got a fucking boxcutter knife, blade out, while giving me the dead stare. He keeps doing it for several seconds,YOUR GOING TO BE A SACRIFICE!""


His reaction to me ""That's it. Hes fucking done. I'm getting him fucking gone tomorrow morning when the boss gets in""

My WTF meter is on fucking defcon 1 at this point

And now

**TL;DR**Coworker goes batshit crazy.

**UPDATE** Oh wow this thread exploded while I was at work. There's no easy way to say this so I'll get right to it.

My coworkers Punk'd me.(Their words)

Yea I'm not a happy camper at the moment


From where I left off before, I got Matt's last name and phone number from him, and as I'm literally about to call his wife, he stops me and gives me the big reveal. They were fucking with me. Most the interactions Matt had with me and others were thought up hours in advance, though some were pure improv based on how I reacted.

Matt and my backup supervisor were both the masterminds in this. half a dozen other people were in on it

They had actually had events planned out for the rest of Friday, each one to be more unhinged then the last, and one of them would even have fake bloody finger prints on it. For the grand finale Matt was gonna switch his box cutter for a huge ass kitchen knife, with some of the fake blood on it, and then fake stab my backup supervisor near the end of the day.

I work with assholes, and were prolonging getting him fired to Friday instead of right away. I told Matt he should move to fucking Hollywood, That was damn fucking good acting. Shit some of my other coworkers were even creeped out by his acting. *while being in on it*.

Let's take a closer look at this snake:

1. You were the exclusive domestic wireless carrier of the iPhone for over three years.

2. For those years in exclusivity, for the simple fact that you did not want to give commission to your own pressured, hardworking employees, especially when Apple salespeople can sign up contracts to new customers, collect activation fees, and sell accessories, all for free.

3. You increased the price of the unlimited data plan for users going from the iPhone 2G to the iPhone 3G

4. You also forced all users who had iPhones, regardless of legitimate reasons.

5. You sat back and collected the revenue from iPhone users, to the point of public ridicule on late night talk shows.

6. Instead of listening to customers and using the revenue to build out your burdened infrastructure, as a means to establish some sort of damage control.

7. You went from unlimited data plans to paltry tiered plans, a month after its worldwide release.

8. For the loyal, you reward them by threatening them and throttling them at your own discretion.

9. You tweak your network speeds and demand that Apple call it 4G on their devices

10. You directly blame customers for all your offerings

11. You attempt to acquire T-Mobile, the USDoJ, consumer advocate groups, the mass media, and the general public about practically everything to said acquisition, then after your surprise at its failure, you gloat at T-Mobile for laying off employees.

I've been where you are. You're confused about what you want to do

Growing up, I didn't want friends. The friends I did manage to make back-stabbed me and I became even more jaded towards the humanity of my generation.

I never tried in school. I was too focused on getting home and playing around on my Playstation or IM'ing some random people online. I used to be lazy beyond belief. Sure I showered every day, literally even in high school I did work at school and nothing at home. I used to sleep in and waste away my days, carelessly blocking out reality. 

This kept up for years and years

Last year, and unhappy. When Christmas came and I was informed that I would not be able to attend second semester, it dawned on me that something needed to change. I decided to re-enroll in the program for the following year and take some time to better myself personally. Nobody understood, but I didn't work, I didn't go to school. I stayed home for 5 months until my previously lined up summer job came around. Incidentally, when I failed out, in the same month I lost my 12 year old Golden Retriever

I started running every day, then 30, and then an hour, about 8 kilometers, sometimes I would do it twice a day. I also started eating whole foods, nothing that came in a package with the exception of canned tuna. This was **very** difficult. I used to eat somewhere between 3000-4000 calories a day at 250 lbs, and I went from that to about 1400-1500 a day of whole foods and vegetables. 

I also started reading, musical instruments, etc. I started listening to new music and watching classic movies. I found so many things that I never thought I would have loved as much as I do now. When I was young, I would just do one thing over and over because it made me comfortable in the moment, but this wasn't the case. I've never been so versatile and interested in so many things. 

With this new found knowledge

Fast forward to July. I turn 20, and the level of self-awareness I currently possess is absolutely astounding. Growing up, when I thought about the future, or where I would be next year, it made me nervous, and I would just immediately think of something else, or play another video game. I would block out the thought of me putting effort into something now for some fun later. I didn't see the **big** picture, play later*. I've lived by this for the past little while and I can assure you

I used to be terrible in math, etc. 

There is no limit to what any of you can do. Trust me

You can too.

Anyway

**tl;dr**: Extreme case of laziness and no motivation. It took me failing to realize that I didn't want to fail anymore, started trying in school and am finally seeing the big picture and where I want to be in 2, 5, even 10 years.

Originally what I was thinking was I'd offer a dollar for every net point this post gets, but that just seemed too complicated.

So finally I'm not sure what to offer--something probably between 25 cents per net point and a dollar per net point.  How's that?

The charity to which I'll contribute is [Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children](http://www.tsrhc.org/).  It's a pediatric orthopedic hospital which provides free medical treatment for any child who needs it.  

I know how marvelous what it offers is--not just because of the web site, including college ball, to run after/from my children as we play, to walk along the beaches of the Mediterranean or under starlight on crystalline cold nights in Maine.  

I owe TSRH a lot.  To say I've never forgotten what those doctors did for me is an understatement.

Anyway, of course, reddit.  (And certainly of course if you thought TSRH was a worthy charitable cause for your own giving, on behalf of all the children you'd help I'd say thank you.)

...Oh I better give it a timetable, 4/4?  I won't have hit 10k by then, but that's all right.

OH!  Also!  Right now the hospital has its annual [""Cotton Patch Challenge""](http://www.tsrhc.org/cotton-patch-cafe-challenge.htm) going

Plus!  The restaurant gives out $25 gift cards to donors--I'll ask that they be given to the children's families.  So we have a chance to do a lot of really positive real-world karma here.

Thank you tons to everyone who helps.

I don't even mind the people who criticized me.  Maybe one day they'll figure it out.  In the meantime

**Edit2 for anyone who still cares:** net post count right now shows as 391.  Thanks again to everyone who helped!  I'll make the donation on Wed. and post verification as soon as I get something useful from TSRH.  Typically it sends snail-mail

I blacked out for some time and I woke up in pain. I was bleeding from the head and face but, and call for help. All the doors had been jammed shut on vehicle so, I had to crawl out of the side window, which was busted out. I was able to make a 911 call despite barely having service and while I waited, I checked up on my friends and the other driver. 

The other driver was hunched over the steering wheel, EMS arrived to pronounce the other driver and my friend (front passenger) dead on arrival. My friend who was the driver was airlifted to the nearest trauma center where he later died from internal injuries. I had relatively minor injuries which included big bruises from the seat belt and cuts from all the glass. The Sheriff deputies said this had been the 3rd major accident, with fatalities, in 4 months since that intersection had been changed. They said a new Volkswagen Passat was also hit in the same fashion as us and the family walked away unhurt from it.

This has been very hard on me and the families of my friends and other driver. I've had a very different outlook on life since then.

I was taught that racism was when you believe that one race is better than another; kind of like the Nazis who thought blond hair blue eyes was the master race. So if you refuse to give someone a job because they are black and it’s because you think all blacks are lazy it’s not racism but discrimination and stereotyping... but if you didn't give them the job because you thought black people are lesser beings and don't want to be around them

I see a lot whites being scared of being labeled a racist and see a lot blacks scared that all whites are racist and out to get them. 
Here are a few of my opinions

1)	Affirmative action. Nothing is more discriminating that giving me the job because Im Mexican. This takes away any merit of the hard work I did to get where I am

2)	The phrase “reverse racism” is just stupid

3)	People adopting kids of different races that are too concerned of him/her being in touch with his/her roots. The color of my skin does NOT determine that I’m Mexican

4)	Saying things like “I don’t find Mexican girls attractive” or “I would date a Mexican girl but I wouldn’t marry outside my race” is NOT racist it’s just preference

5)	Stop asking for my race in ANY official document if you are truly an equal opportunity employer who cares.

6)    Dont start calling a white person racist because they took 5 minutes to get your damn drink at a bar but it didn’t cross their mind that the place is busy as hell and its taking a long time for everyone to get their drinks.

7)    You are not racist for asking ""why do all *insert race here* do *insert your observation*"" so when people ask me ""why do all Mexicans eat beans?"" I tell them I guess its a is cultural thing... yes I know not all of us eat beans but who cares


Thanks for reading my stupid little rant



TL;DR I like tacos and burritos.  





Edit: I loved reading all you guys comments. On the affirmative action thing, I literally was not allowed to hire two potentialiy great employees because they were white. I guess we had enough whites in the company for now.


Edit 2: Its quite interesting to seeing people calling me a troll cuz of my opinion. Let check out

This woman is incredible - she ran away from home in Poland as a teen, and when the doctor found out she was punished and sent to a work camp. After her camp was liberated by the American troops she met my grandpa, a young American soldier who asked a woman with no teeth, no English, and a child out of wedlock to marry him and long story short, she did just that. Her ornate wedding dress was made by hand by other kind strangers in the Displaced Persons camp she was in.



She came to the US, drive, and had another daughter (my mom). So the thing is, have a really small family, and my mom recently quit her job to move there and take care of my grandma who has lived alone for almost thirty years since my grandpa died. But since my mom is out there, I'm the only family out of state, and the only family to send her cards.

I'm still a little shaken

I was waiting to cross the road, waiting at the center divider to cross towards my side of the road was a man and 2 women. The road was about 10-15 metres wide. The lights had just turned red for the cars and we were just about to begin our cross, waiting that extra beat for the cars to come to a complete halt. Just as I took my first step, I heard a shout from a man and looked up to see a huge truck, moving in direcetion of traffic, mount the curb opposite me and plow right into the 3 people there, all, having taken their first steps to cross the road. The shout had come from the driver. I watched as what must have been 4 wheels ran over one of the women's legs and the man disappeared underneath the truck before it finally came to a stop. It was one of those huge Mcdonalds fridge trucks. The leg was a mess and all you really could see was the yellow of fat and a little bit of blood.  A small stream of blood trickled slowly from the leg. The other woman lay on the ground, seemingly unscathed. Behind, a traffic warden of some kind rode up on his scooter and started his siren. I don't know how he got there so fast.

I took out my phone to call an ambulance but I saw the woman next to me with hers out already. I figured she was going to call so I was about to keep my phone when I realised she was taking photos. Someone on a motorcycle nearby shouted for someone to call the ambulance. I dialed the number and began talking to the operator. I told him as best as I could where the accident had occured and what had happened. I was pretty shaken so it was harder than expected. He asked me if there was anyone underneath the truck and I said yes. He said he'd bring a fire truck or something. I couldn't really hear amidst the racket of the siren. 

I looked at the people around me, exclaiming about how they didn't know what to do, that they were scared, expressing what I could only guess was shock and incrdulity. That was pretty much how I felt at the time. 

At one point the question came up whether or not the traffic warden knew that there was a third casualty under the truck, the kind of scream that you hear when you watch one of the clips of people injured at the scene of bombings and stuff, in a long drawn out almost half cry, half scream of anguish and shock and fear). It was not a pleasant sound. THe traffic warden talked to her and then she lay on the ground, motionless for a while before getting up and screaming again. The other woman seemed dazed but otherwise fine except for a trickle of blood down her face. Anyway, we wondered if the traffic warden was aware of the man under the truck and one of the women spoke to another man who had joined us about it. He went over to the warden to talk to him. 

It was about maybe 10 minutes before we finally decided to try and make our way across the road. I tried not to look at the scene as I walked past. My phone rang and I picked up. It was the emergency hotline people. They wanted to know if I had called about the accident and whether someone was trapped under the tyres. I didn't want to look but I looked. The man was in a heap, but it didn't seem that he was under a tyre. I said as much. I wanted to leave, so I asked the man on the line if I could. He was slightly hesitant but said ok. While this conversation was happening, the feeling of shock was getting worse for me. I was close to the accident when it happened and now It was right next to me as I waited for the next traffic light change so I could complete the cross. At the same time the woman who had taken the photos was telling me to watch where I stepped. I didn't want to look down. But I did. Strewn across the pavement and the road were these little bits of flesh. No blood, just bits and chunks of flesh and viscera. The one thing I remember thinking then was that it just looked like raw chicken breasts. Not unlike the kind of stuff you'd see at the market. Just lying there. Chicken. Finally we crossed. Passing the bustop on the way home I saw the woman who had run off, her face still colourless. I actually mean colourless here. Not as an expression. Just gray. I walked home, told my dad and cried for while. This was maybe 3-4 hours ago.

Thinking back, sad for the lives ruined, but then, that wasn't on my mind. I also kind of feel guilty for leaving. I think I could have stayed if I didn't cross the road, but once I reached that center divider it really hit me, the horror of it all. I couldn't stay. But I feel like I should have. I know as I left a paramedic on a bike arrived, and the traffic warden and his siren was there, even if I don't know what for. At least I've calmed down some and stopped shaking. Thanks for listening.

**Edit #2**  I know I should find something I love to do and I actually tried that already.  I worked in film for a few years until the recession hit.  I didn't know anyone in the business and pretty much had to make a name for myself.  Unfortunately, which is/was Cinematography and the closest thing I can do to that is photography.  Even then, I am sometimes so mentally exhausted that I can't bother to even think about taking pictures.

I should also add that I am Asian and there's just a whole different meaning if I quit my job.  The hours are just as much as any of my coworkers as well so it is expected of me to work equal or more hours or I'm looked down upon.  There are no 2 week vacations for me.  We rarely get any holidays off other than the major ones.  Even if I was allowed to take a vacation, 40 hrs.  The other side, I don't want to shame my family's name by taking days off or not working extra hours.  I don't know.  I just take it on the chin and roll with it because one day, when my dad retires, the company will be mine.  If there's a company still left by that time.  I've been given a golden ticket and I'm very grateful for that.  While most people are struggling to find jobs, I have been given an opportunity to run my own business that's already been established for me.  That's something a very few people get a chance to have.  I understand how valuable that is and that is a huge reason why I can't just get up and leave.  ",,,,
1344143383.0,xpc7a,"I FINALLY passed College Algebra. Some may scoff, but I feel great.",JCork,580,195,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/xpc7a/i_finally_passed_college_algebra_some_may_scoff/

I'm a pretty bright kid, a D, and the occasional B in all my math courses since junior high. However, I'm very good at standardized tests, and did awesome on my ACT exam. My lowest score was in math, and it was a 23. I was able to skip all the not-for-credit college math courses and go straight into college algebra.

I tried to get it out of the way in my first college semester. Bad idea. I was still more of a high-schooler than a college student. I skipped way too much class, I would've had to score something like a 96% or better on everything that remained, *in order to get a B in the course.* I dropped the class, got like 25% of my money back, and finished the semester with 13 credit hours. 

Second semester comes around, but ended with a D. I felt horrible.

I'm a (prospective) business student. The business college at my school is pretty damn selective about admission. You have to have nearly all of your gen-eds done, explaining my distaste for algebra, and my confidence that my grade in that class wasn't reflective of my potential in the business school. They allowed me to take two of the courses that require the C or better in College Algebra before enrolling, no problem. But when I attempted to enroll in the third and final course with a College Algebra prerequisite, they said no. I had to retake it, no exceptions.

I then wrote a very long email

So, again. For the third time. This time, it was an online course. I did all my homework, and two out of my four exams on my computer. The other two exams were in front of the instructor, and thus were weighted much more heavily than the work I could ~~cheat on~~ do at home.

I worked my ass off all summer long, but it wasn't a big deal, the instructor assigned 15 quizzes but only kept your top 10 scores. I felt pretty good, but I was still far from ""good"" at math.

I took my final exam two days ago

I finished with about twenty minutes to spare out of our two-hour time limit. I'm usually the first person done when it comes to tests

I finished with a B+. A fucking B plus. I'm ecstatic. I ***never*** have to take a math course again. Ever. And, in all my schooling, is completely behind me. I'm actually looking forward to going to class this coming semester. I almost wish I had more than one class to go to every day. I feel like the shitty attitude I used to have about school is completely gone. Yeah, I still want to finish up in four years and get out into the real world, but I don't dread school any more. It's great, and I just thought I'd share.

He always emphasized caring, or in other words, true friendship. Discovering the wonderful simplicity in a bird's song or the color of flowers on a rainy day was his daily life, and he tried to make that our daily lives. No matter what, even if he had never met a person, that person was both his neighbor and his friend.  
He took the time to answer all of his fanmail personally, a floor usually reserved for the loudest and most bombastic. No matter what, he never stopped defending educational programs for kids, because he knew that if there was to be children's programming on television, there should be worthwhile material.  
I was lucky enough to watch him on television as a kid, those qualities made it that much more poignant. His messages of friendship and curiosity and learning are not only worthwhile for children, but for adults as well. Too many of us, myself included, grow up to be cynical and solely concerned with gaining employment for a job I don't like to appease people I don't like all because I need money to live. He always tells us to appreciate the little things in life, because it is the little things that make us appreciate life that much more.

I had a colicky baby right behind me all the way over the 2-hour flight, was it in heavy fog. It looked like flying into a dense cotton cloud and intending to find an airport in there. The fog was so bad you would barely see the hand at the end of your arm.

Fast forward as I doze off, looking like any landing. The thrust hits me as my back presses into the seat, I see us lifting back off the tarmac again, and fast, in a scream of engine fury, the runway fades below us into the fog. I feel the plane tilting sharply backward to climb, and adrenaline is pumping in every capillary

Wow, emergency landings, but never this particular flavor of exception to the pattern.

That set me thinking of what just happened. There would be two reasons to abort a landing: you miss the runway

We climbed and climbed for minutes. Out of the fog, the PA crackled, and a very professional but clearly tense voice announced: ""Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We had to abort the landing because the runway was... (pause) ...blocked. We will be returning for another landing in ten minutes. Thank you.""

The names have been changed to protect myself against any possible lawsuits that may come about from the fracas that occurred last night. Also, and I am not a strong or muscular person at all. I am tall, however, which definitely helped.

Without further ado

My friend, I was not drinking as there tends to be a lot of cops in this particular area. After the bar closes, Tiffany gets a call from her friend Leah about a house party a few blocks away. Hoping to get in Tiffany's pants, I happily agree to extend the night even further into the morning. On the way to the party, Tiffany says to me, ""I should warn you that there will be a guy [Frank] at this party that is obsessed with me. He may say some things to us. Oh, and he is a Marine."" Now, as I am a likable person, as well as shit-faced drunk.

We arrive at the house, and that he is going to beat the shit out of me. I felt a sense of worry when he started to become very specific about what he was going to do to me.

I tell Tiffany that we should definitely get the hell out of there, and we walk to my car. At this point Frank, and his two buddies are outside and following us. One of Frank's minions runs up to me, and says, ""Where do you think you're going?"" and pulls my off the sidewalk. I know at this point that I cannot get myself in a situation where dudes are holding me down, as Frank rains blows upon me.

And then, which says to use every weapon you have, including hits to the testicles, sucker punches, eye gouging, etc. And this is exactly what I did.

When the first guy pulled me off to the side, I guess this guy had some unfinished business with me, and started slowly toward me again hunched over, as I am unlocking the car. I wait until he gets fairly close, and I sidekick him right in the gut. He falls on the pavement, and decides he has had enough, as he rolled away.

Tiffany slides into the passenger seat, and charges toward me like a tornado of insane. Let me mention here that this dude is huge. About the same height as me, but much, much stronger. He's a Marine, god damn it! I am lucky that I was standing behind the driver side door, or else he would have tackled me and beat me to a pulp. But, instead

I then channel back to [tresbeay's](http://www.reddit.com/user/tresbeay) Fighting Tip #1, as I gouge and scratch away at that eye. He pulls back, and barks, ""What the fuck did you do to my eye!?"" He charges again, but this time I had my keys in my hand as I am trying to get ready to drive away from this madness. I take one of the keys, and begin to gouge away at his left eye again. He is terrified at this point, and is muttering ""Is that a key!? Fuck man!? Ahhh!!!"" He falls backward, and the alarm starts going off. This gives him time to hit the side of my car in anger

I peel out of there, and how his plan to beat the shit out of me completely backfired.

tl;dr: Reddit saved my life. I am in your debt forever.

Just about every NSFW subreddit is getting slammed with spam posts that link to viruses and malware. These posts are peppered with some domains that have content just to throw you off. Over the past two days I have reported hundreds of sock accounts to /r/reportthespammers. 

For the most part we are getting almost no response. So the sock accounts are now submitting other domains. Here is what I asking for help on. 

Install Reddit Enhancement Suite. Go into the settings / filters / spam button and turn on (You should see a blue on button when done). When you are done refresh reddit. You will see next to any submission the letters rts. This is a quick feed to reporting a spammer. If you see spam click on the rts. It will open a separate tab in /r/reportthespammers. If it has not been submitted click save at the bottom. 

If it has been submitted (less than seven days ago) upvote it. 

If it has been submitted seven or more days ago click on the submit it again near the top. Put in it that this is a 2nd report. and you have to type in below that this needs to go to the reportthespammers subreddit. 

Message the admins. 

Go to messages /compose. Sent it to /r/reddit.com subject spam attack. Let them know you have been reporting spammers who are not getting shadow banned. reportthespammers treats porn spam like it doesn't exist. So we need to let the admins know. 

Keep it short and simple. 

So you know currently we have been getting spammed by the following domians. 

bibleofporn.com

notanotherporntube.com

pointerweb.biz

scrolltube.info

mybabes.biz

letmeseeya.com

They will include some images from imgur. The sock accounts usually have no comments. Most are less than a month old but we are getting some that are almost three months old. Many that have been previously reported. 

If you see any submissions like this even if they are not in your subreddit please report the post. If you can let the other mods know what is going on. If you want to see please click on my profile and see what I have been doing with my weekend. You can also go to reportthespammers and click on new and see how much I have lit that place up.

 It hit me earlier that most people on the world, have managed at some point to convince a member of the opposite sex (or same in some cases) to engage in a relationship, or even just sex, a lot even multiple times. As someone who has managed to do neither, despite trying my hardest during most of my life, I can't really understand how they do it. 

 I just cant establish deep connections with other people, when it gets too big for all to be a part of the same conversation and smaller groups form up, I will often find myself alone unable to connect and share interests with the people around me, while everyone else just naturally flock together.

 I would like to be able to explain better the difference but I can't since I dont undesrtand it myself. This was very obvious to me everytime I would get into something new with other people. The first few days when no one knew each other I would be in equal footing with everyone else and you would perhaps even take me for someone like them. I would be able to talk and get to know everybody

1356990606.0,15qs2s,Two years ago I posted an AMA about finding out my wife was having an affair. I signed &amp; submitted my divorce today. Here's my follow up AMA.,throwaway4196,509,158,99,"I've gotten a few messages asking how things went since my last post 2 years ago (!).  I said I would do a follow-up

I did tell her that night that I knew.  She more or less dug-in her heels.   While she did curtail contact with the guy…our relationship was in a tail-spin -- we were still connected but crashing.  Since she was at home, which she agreed to.   I know that the guy had cut off contact with her, so she was stuck.  I, on the other hand, vowed to still try to work on saving the marriage, I took that vow explicitly right?   Deep down, I knew this was doomed to failure; however I felt that I needed to see this thru so that in the aftermath I could say I had no regrets.  We got thru the birth, and figuring out how to raise two kids.

In September, uh, you can’t do that, we’re married.  I knew I was throwing the gauntlet down at that point.  And it was then the marriage was over.

We started taking turns living at our house.  She was still a stay-at-home mom, just stick it out and do a divorce when you want to.  So that’s what we did. 

She moved out in October 2011.  We split the kids 50/50, but not as expensive as lawyers.  However neither of us was happy with the progress the mediator was making – having us do this pointless budget exercises – so we put the divorce on hiatus.    We did some of it, namely the parenting plan, on our own.  But really, we just got busy with our own lives.    As the year was ending, I really didn’t want this to bleed into the New Year, so made the push to get the paperwork done today.  And it has.

It’s funny re-reading the things I wrote in my first AMA.   I didn’t fully grasp how long and deep the affair had gone on…far longer than I expected.  I underestimated how much damage had already been done.  Many things I didn’t know.  I was pretty naïve.  My biggest regret is how long I helped drag it out. However

As for the kids, they really don’t know any different.   I believe they are coping as best as could be hoped.    Birthdays with both families are awkward but oh well.  My parents often help when I have the kids, so they are developing a strong relationship with them.   On the other hand, they now hang out with that guy as well, which as whole, was the hardest part of all for me.   But there isn’t anything I can do about that.  They are safe and happy, so I’m thankful for that.

As for me…2011 was a basically a lost year for me.  I really can’t tell you much, and I hung on to that for support.  I was rewarded with a huge promotion so that was good.  

2012 is a different story.  I have hard time recalling a year where I’ve more fun in my life.   I made a key new friend and with that opened up a new world for me.  I look better, go all out to parties when I’m not dad.  Stay out late.  Spent time with some beautiful women.  The outlook for 2013 looks very good, and I’m eager to get started.

I’m sure I’ve forgotten a lot of stuff

I bared my teeth, I stopped

I waited, more rocks fell from above.  I could hear that whatever it was, it was definitely large, and it was definitely moving in my direction.  It was definitely not a deer.

I felt a very novel

Lions like to perch on the high ground and ambush their prey by dropping down on them, knife and mace still in hand.  I put on my jacket - a pitiful defense against a mauling, but better than bare skin - and scanned the brush.  I crowed, hurling threats full of hot air through bared canines.  

I still couldn't see anything moving, I got down from the rock and strode - boldly, I hoped - across the shallowest part of the wash and up a steep embankment, to the tallest point in range.  I cast furtive glances behind me, but tried to make my fearful vigilance look like aggressive vigilance instead. 

At the top, was the lion.  It was watching me, watching it, watching me.  I pretended to mock it, told it I was meaner than it was, and picked up a rock and hurled it with great force onto a boulder - the resultant *crack* resonated pleasingly.  The lion just watched me.  Eventually, I had to start back toward the trailhead; if the sun went down and I was still out there...  

I hiked back buzzing from head to toe, blade-out, in a defensive position by my throat.  I probably stepped on cryptobiotic soil, much to what would usually be my tree-hugging dismay.   I could hear footsteps following me, but the cat kept out of sight.  About an hour later, I approached the road.  I never would have thought that the sound of cars would fill my heart with such profound relief.

1374609562.0,1iwmwz,Yesterday a kid tried to commit suicide by jumping in front of my car. Here is the story...,myns23,450,104,39,"I was driving home from work and was just getting onto the on ramp when I noticed a guy walking up it. I was changing my music at the time and wasn't paying too much attention. I notice out of the corner of my eye he starts moving toward my car and I start hitting the breaks. I am moving as far away from him as I can and he is obviously trying to get hit. I hit him at about 20 mph and am to say the least startled. I watch him lay on the ground for about a minute then he opens his eyes and gets up and walks to the side of my car.


""What the hell was that."" 
""I don't know man.""
 ""Are you okay""
 ""I don't know""

At this point I'm looking at him to make sure he is not hurt and he appears fine. No blood or any marks on his body. He didn't struggle to move around. I am assuming at this point it is one of those insurance frauds I have seen on here and am not sure whether I should drive away or call the cops.

""Honestly man what was that.""
""I don't know

At this point I'm thinking he probably needs someone to talk too and I can't just drive off. I want to call the cops but I don't know if that will help this kid.

""Do you need someone to talk to want to grab some food or something."" ""I don't know

I look him up and down and hes not a grungy kid he is pretty cleaned up and doesn't look like he has anything on him. I tell him to get in my car and try to talk with him. I asked him what's going on and why he is doing this. He doesn't give much of a reply. Just says he doesn't know I continue to try to see what he is interested in and what he likes about life. Apparently he was 23 years old and has aspergers. He also tells me how he is just messed up. I am making a point to kinda watch him in case he flips out and I have to keep him back or do something. He seems to be acting normal except for some minor things like eye contact.

I get to the center of town and ask him where he wants to go. I explain he needs some help and who can I take him to to get some help. We discuss the hospital and the police and he says he just wants to sit down. He says let go to this restaurant which was a pud (I really wish I had thought it through and not brought him there.)

I notice when we get out that my car has minor damage and I'm kinda pissed but I am not going to lay into the kid.

I also realize this is a fucked up situation and I probably shouldn't be doing this but I don't know what to do. I am also in a lot of shock which is messing with me.

When we get in the pud apparently the bartender knows him and asks if he is doing alright. He mumbles something to her. I realize I need to talk to this girl to get someone who knows him here to help him out. We get a beer and I keep talking to him to see what's up and how he feels right now about everything. His responses are short and doesn't seem to trying to communicate. I tell him we need to get him some help and I need to talk to someone and he just kinda ignores it. He says he has a therapist and I have him call him but no one answers. I go up the bar to get a refill and tell the girl that I need to talk to her and this kid needs someone here to help him. She nods as he runs up behind us to ask what we are talking about. I said I was getting another beer. 

Sometime passes and a little more banter while I try to tell him that life can get better but you have to want it to get better and continue to work on yourself. Eventually the girl comes over and says why don't we all talk outside. Apparently he told her that he tried killing himself by jumping in front of my car when he was getting a beer. We start to talk to him about what his options are and what we are going to do. He talks about calling his dad and we mention the police. He has attempted this kind of thing before and has been in and out of the insane asylum and other psychological centers.

We go back inside well he thinks about what he is going to do. The girl explains she is going to call one of her police officer friends and have him come by. I agree thats a good choice. I wait around for about 20 minutes and she looks at me and say I can get going if I want she will take care of it. I was torn between leaving but I wasn't sure if I could be of anymore help. She seemed like she could do more for him and take care of him better than I could. I wish the kid luck and than tell him it will be okay. As I step outside I see a cop car and am so relieved I speak to the officer about the incident. He get my information and proceeds to go inside. I wait a few minutes and they walk out with. I tell him that he'll get the help he needs and be better soon. I drive home.



TL:DR - a kid with aspergers jumped in front of my car trying to kill himself and wasn't hurt. I took him to a place (pub) to talk and relax. Met someone he knew in the bar and she called the cops.

1364544279.0,1b8d97,"My First Racism: Or, ""Fucking N*****r,"" Cry of the Red Baron | NSFW Language",NomadBlack,554,189

**My First Racism: Or

To be clear, a few unusually harsh punishments in mostly-white schools, and many ""You're not like other black people!"" moments. But nothing like, say, a hate crime, blatant discrimination, or the usage of a racial slur with earnest

That said, a few new ways to conceptualize my dysfunctionality/cognitive distortions/procrastination; talking face-to-face with one of the original radical feminists; and experiencing some psycho-physiological triggers that sent me into a mental haze of agitation, frustation, and disjointed thought processes. The weirdest part, however, came after all that (technically this morning).

----------

So I'm sitting in my living/dining room/kitchen/hallway, and I decide to cave in. I bike furiously to a nearby 24-hour Mexican food place, leave my bike just past one side of the door, and walk in.

I only notice one other customer as I walk in, I stand a few feet away from the counter, scanning the menu for something that'll put me in a nice food coma. A worker comes out from the back and steps to the counter, stares at me with unmitigated exhaustion and disinterest for a few seconds, decides I'm not going fast enough, and returns to someplace beyond view. My heart is warmed.

I'm just zeroing in on my preferred choice of coping-feed when

I feel myself tense up a bit—my right temple twitching slightly, since these feelings are all so slight. My reaction is, perhaps, as much a response to the vitriol with which the words were half-spat, half-mumbled as it is to the words themselves. Ultimately, however, this gut response is fleeting,' I surmise. 'It doesn't matter.'

Without so much as a glance towards the other customer

""Fucking nigger, and I get to orderi—""fucking nigger."" Tired employee guy glances at the patron (maintaining his gaze of zero-level interest), then back to me. I finish the order; he gets to work.

On my way back—""fucking nigger""—to my seat, or nothing important/valuable at all). He's just—""fucking nigger""—gotten into his bright-metallic-red scooter, and is now struggling to put his left sandal back on with the use of his cane and left hand. He looks up at me a few times while he struggles to put on his sandal for—""fucking nigger""—about 3 minutes, but never speaks while looking at me. My—""fucking nigger""—gaze remains constant.

""Fucking nigger... fucking nigger... fucking niggers... fuck them niggers... fuck them niggers... "" I idly ponder whether he has Tourrette syndrome

The guy seems a bit frustrated by his footwear ordeal, since I'm sitting right next to the door, he'll have to pass pretty close by me to get out. My mind offers up a few fucked up things to do if he physically engages me, the cruelest being to simply take his cane and toss it out into the parking lot (you can see how very violent I am). Tired-bored-underpaid is soon standing at the counter with my food, so I walk over again.

After thanking the red-eyed burro-roller

He responds

I didn't quite hear him

""I said

""Are you gonna arrest me?""  

I hear him clearly this time. I chuckle.  

""Do I look like a cop? No

""Then get the hell away from me.""  

This makes me laugh again, as intended, while watching this crotchety fellow continue to fail to put on his sandal. He eventually succeeds, and I think grabs his leftovers; I'm unsure because I'm much more interested in my meal at this point. During this time I hear a barely-audible string of mumbled words, distinguishing only something to the effect of 'I oughtta rough you up,' and, of course, the guy is silent.

A few moments pass and my mind's already focused on the night's earlier agitating experiences, pathetically arduous preparation is complete. As he begins to silently scoot his way out of the restaurant, I contemplate maybe giving him a nice message on the way out, my frustrated mind failing to conjure anything more fun or interesting (nor, ironically, anything angrier) to do.

Just as he passes me, I realize this may have been because my bike was blocking him from going the other way), followed by a soft *crack*, and then nothing else.

...

After a few minutes, and pack up my food. I notice a broken styrofoam container and some spilled food on the sidewalk as I leave. 'How sad,' I think. Then I strap my leftovers to my bike and head home.

----------

And that

----------

**Edit**


**tl;dr:**  
I was frustrated and hungry. Also, I heard him say ""fucking nigger"". I had a mild gut reaction, but didn't respond. I then heard ""fucking nigger"" said repeatedly throughout the process of choosing, ordering, and waiting for my food. I had no more reaction, and didn't respond.

While waiting, and was repeatedly failing to put his sandal back on. When I walked up to get my food, I asked if he wanted some help; he asked if I was going to arrest him; I lol'd and said no; he said to get the fuck away from him. I sat down by the door and started eating.

There has been a confirmed number (thus far) of 5 fatalities, some people are still missing.  There are multiple counties joining in the search and rescue for the people of Woodward.  The tornado sirens did not go off due to the storm approaching too quickly, along with a malfunction (lightning strike).  Police and other emergency officials have mentioned to keep calling relatives/friends there to a minimum due to it jamming their lines, so TEXTING would be the next best thing.  I know I'd probably try a few more times before giving it a break.  I hope that everyone else is okay, and if I weren't so far away, I know I'd be right there with the search and rescue teams helping them.  Donations are also being accepted, take any donations to the Living Word Fellowship Church.  They are also looking for any help they anyone can provide.  Thanks again y'all

A few months ago, we met at a party back home with some old high school friends. I was shocked to see that she had grown into a gorgeous young woman in the few years since I had seen her. We got pretty drunk that night, made out a little bit, and I ended up partying too hard so she took care of me until I fell asleep.

After that, but we talked all the time. It turned out that, not only was she gorgeous, but she was also rather intelligent! We agreed on a ton of topics and she seemed to be very passionate about music and life. I wanted to become more than friends, but I was hesitant. I had tried and failed at a long-distance relationship with a different girl from the same school. So I didn't say anything and we stayed just friends.

1375801313.0,1jtbue,I get treated a lot better since losing weight and I kind of hate it,weightlossthrowawayy,457,122,142,"First

By my own self perception I’ve gone from lardass to a bit tubby (about 2 stone overweight but I think my height and the fact that all my clothes are a bit big plays it down a bit). I'm currently about one stone (14lbs) away from being in the healthy range but just over two stone (28lbs) to my goal (11stone/154lbs)


One of the biggest things I’ve noticed since losing weight is how people treat me and it’s weird. Before my weight would be pretty much open to scrutiny by anyone- I remember being about six years old and asking my dad for a snack and he just said “what, family members would drop hints like “you know, I had a friend who managed to lose a lot of weight by just…."", strangers would shout at me from cars, kids would laugh, guys would jokingly say things like “ahh, my mate fancies you!"" etc to the point where I developed social anxiety and didn’t feel good enough to go outside. A PE teacher once sat me down and lectured me on my weight and then told me to pretend I’d hurt my ankle and sent me to sit on the side of the boy’s lesson so I wouldn’t slow the rest of my class down when they went for a run (I wish she could see me now but she moved to Spain and I’ve since left school)

To anyone who's seen My Mad Fat Diary - the scene where Rae has ""jabba"" shouted at her was pretty much what happened to me regularly. 

I just got back from a walk and I saw a group of 3-4 kids on bikes

Another thing is more strangers make eye contact, so he could have kept going and not felt guilty because I’d be able to cross a second later but he stopped. I smiled and nodded as I crossed as a thank you and he smiled back and watched me as I walked across the road and turned his head to watch me walk the pavement alongside his car before driving off. I’m convinced that that’s due to my weight too. Also the way I've been treated in the past makes me feel suspicious when people flirt with me, like their mates have put them up to it for a laugh. It's pathetic that I'm 18 years old and I still haven't had my first kiss but anyway, that's not what this is about. 

It just makes me feel kind of disgusted. I'm sure it's not a conscious thing that people are nicer (see the halo effect) but it just leaves a bad taste.

I hate the phrase ""fat shaming"" but I think it applies to what I've experienced.

Thank you to anyone that actually read this. It feels good to get it off my chest.

1298656828.0,fsojg,"I just googled a festival I went to 6 years ago, and found a picture of myself passed out in the mud. This is the time I, was ""that guy"".",,625,135

The whole weekend was quite a story so I'm going to give a short version to hopefully make some people feel better about their current predicaments. 

I was having a really rough time, and living in an area I absolutely hated. Not to mention girl problems. I was miserable. 

Earlier in the month some friends from pittsburgh mentioned they were going to the All Good Music Festival in West Virginia. I knew I would be too busy, so in order to see them I'd have to leave early, wasn't gonna happen. 

Well, I freaked out and walked out on the project I was working on and spontaneously decided to drive the 4 hours to west virginia, with no ticket, no extra clothes, no friends, no green...

I arrived at a line of cars to get in around 10:00pm, taking a few cars with it. So in line I wait, all the while, hearing people saying things like it's a 6 hour line, etc. Slowly moving towards the show by myself, it takes until 2:00am to get to the front gate. 

At this point I was very bummed out abut missing the lips. And multiple times in the line I could hear their songs in the distance. Not to mention the 8 hours I just sat in a car, and get inside, and ask this crazy hippy dude if the lips went on, he was like ""yeah, it was awesome!"" UGGHHH...  Then I asked if he had any smoke, to which he happily smoked me out. I immediately started to feel better, as I realized at least I wouldn't have to work for the next two days.

So I leave him, which by the way is in this huge valley between two mountains, absolutely beautiful. Then I see Wayne Coyne (flaming lips lead singer for those of you that don't know) walk up to the mic, and say ""I think we're about ready to get started!"" I couldn't believe it! They hadn't played yet? Later I learned that some part of the stage broke postponing everything. The hippy must have been.. well, a crazy hippy.. and the music I heard while waiting in line must have been loud car stereos or something. I freaked out!

Half an hour into their set it started down pouring, the entire time, and was probably the happiest I'll ever be. They played past 4:30am, two encores. 

I found my friends, nothing mattered. So i did a bunch of drugs and passed out at like 2pm.. it is not a dirt nap. I was out. Some friendly gentleman eventually gave me a small chair to sit in, and fortunately I didn't care about the string cheese incident, so I didn't miss any bands I really liked. Came out of it around 6 and just relaxed the whole rest of the weekend. 

The moral of the story, run away and get back to the basics of what makes you happy, and you'll be much better off, even if you look like a fool. 


TL;DR Enjoy your life even if it's embarrassing sometimes :)

I really think that it is not a breach of free speech for the mods to actually *moderate* in order to promote healthy discussion in subreddits like these.  Post something sexist lets do something like put you on posting probation or even ban you.

I'll try to make this as less of a block of text as possible.

Small back story:  I am 30[m], the oldest is the one we are talking about today.  He is in his 40s, three kids from three women, twice divorced.  His most recent divorce was last year, about 6 months after his wife had given birth to his 3rd kid.  Their family is not very... stable.  Relationship wise or mentally wise.  There's more, but I digress...

I live about 20 minutes from him.  His family and my wife's family live about 9-10 hours away (driving).  This weekend, and I to drive to his house to meet him, and come back with MIL.  Before we get in the car, he calls my wife and tells her he doesn't think I should come over, because of something that happened last time he was at our house.  Naturally, she and I are taken back by this and realize the last time he was at our house was in June of last year (right before the divorce).  

Today my wife, and finally get her to tell us what supposedly happened.

**So, who told me...**  

&gt;Last June he was at my house visiting with his (then)wife, watched me do this for a minute or so, then yelled at me and asked what I was doing.  He then yelled or argued with me, packed up his family, and left.

**Let me be clear here.  None of this is true.**  I remember them coming over (because it was right after my birthday, because he said the 5 year old was behaving bad or something.  Honestly I really don't remember much because we're talking about over... 7 months ago this supposedly happened.

Since then, never seemed like anything was different or weird.  

I've been very angry today since hearing this.  I've never done anything like that, I have a handful of nieces and nephews, and of course my own child which I love with all my heart.  I'm trying not to babble, but I hope my position is clear on this.

What I'm trying to ask, my relationship with my wife, and her family.

**Tl;dr**  I'm accused of looking up a 5 year old's skirt in my house 7 months ago.  It did not happen.  Accuser's family is close friends with wife's family

Mr. Whiny Butt asked a question

In 40 years of teaching I have never had so many students so anxious about grades. I understand that you want to get good grades. But this obsession is counterproductive.

I have said several times in class that the key is in YOUR work at pulling out the most important stuff from the lecture outlines I've given you. Mr. Whiny Butt, so now, would I please tell you exactly what to study for the exam.

Well

I told you early on to, using the boldfaced material on the outlines. Take a risk, launch out on your own, do your own summarizing of my summarizing. That's how you learn.

You've been cheated out of a high school education. You've been mommified, not fathers. You've been told do this, do that instead of, okay, you're old enough now, learn to do it yourself.

It's not your fault

Learn to learn. Learn to take a body of material

The grading system at this university and at all universities is a huge lie. You are all obsessed with getting As. Let me let you in on a huge secret.

If everyone gets all As, not superior.

And employers and grad schools know this. They don't pay attention to GPA
GPA scores
are
meaningless.

Meaningless.

Meaningless.

Employers and grad schools find other ways to find out whether you are in the top 10% or top 50% or top 70%.

If you learn to learn now
it'
will
help
you
learn skills valuable to an employer: initiative

Learn to see the forest. You've been taught only to see the trees.

Did you write down two or three important things after each class session

YOU have to choose the two or three most important things for each class session. Because in the choosing of them you evaluate the other things that you didn't choose and you learn something about them as well.

Yes

If that's what you want in life, I'll just give you all As on it.

Everyone will get an A on the exam and only those who actually want to learn something about Catholicism need to come to class from here on out. You all get As for the course and you'll be happy.

Just send me that email.

Some of you already know about how to take initiative and boil a body of material down to its most important points and take that knowledge out of the material. They are the ones who truly should get the As and they would be the one's with the kind of skills employers and med schools are looking for. The others should get Bs and Cs and Ds.

But as it stands

Since it was a half-day of school we got out around noon and decided we would go to the park. There wasn't really anyone else around since it midday in the city so it was just us and for some reason there was a girl there standing by herself.

She was a few years older than us but not by that much and I remember she was cute. The was a bit taller than us and had her hair in a bun. She had a jacket and skirt on which was weird because it was cold that day and we all had coats. 

At first we kept trying to figure out if she was waiting on someone or just lost and then one of my friends realized that she might be a prostitute. I don't remember exactly how we went from ""she might be a prostitute"" to ""she's definitely a prostitute"" but we were all set on the idea. We talked for a while trying to figure out why she wasn't in school and why she was doing this (at the time we only thought they did things with people for money but we weren't exactly sure what those things were

It wasn't until a few years later that i realized how fucking weird that must of seemed for her.

Reflecting on it later, ""She has mono..."" or ""She has leprosy..."" and I realized that there must be some misconceptions out there about people with introverted personality traits. Dr. David Keirsey contrasts extraversion and introversion using a battery analogy. When extraverts are socially engaged it stimulates them and 'charges their batteries' but when they are only in the company of their self the batteries run out of juice only to be recharged by more social stimulation. Introverts are the opposite in the sense that their 'batteries' are drained by social interaction and recharged by solitude and introspection. One is not necessarily better than the other, it is simply something that makes us individuals. 
	
It is possible to make introversion or even extraversion, of course, it is Vulcanization of the Human race. Live long and prosper.

The gravity of the thing doesn't really hit you for a few years, and secretly, you burn with jealousy at the pitcher, because her dad is the coach. *She's just so damn good.* And in your mind's eye, you see them in their backyard at dusk, fireflies flashing, tossing balls back and forth. You are not envious of new bikes or fancy houses or cool clothes. You are jealous of a moment that you have been denied - the light smell of the mitt's leather on the breeze, that fatherly voice telling you your form is improving.  

At night, I will be good forever if I can have my daddy for one day. And when still the universe is silent, you barter your forever for one minute. One minute with your pop. *I promise I will never ask for another thing if I can just have one moment.*

Later, you realize you understand something about people: We all tell ourselves lies, and this is yours.

I am going to keep it simple. Here is what we do:  

&gt;radioreddit.com is the source for quality new and popular independent music. All music on this site is made by users of the popular site reddit.com  
&gt;
&gt;Our live streams are not controlled by program directors and DJs in the pockets of large labels.  Songs are chosen by an algorithm which only weighs users’ votes when deciding what gets played and what gets excluded as junk.  Songs with high voter approval eventually make it onto the radio reddit charts and get promoted by having a higher probability of being played.  
&gt;
&gt;There are currently four live streams on radio reddit:
&gt;main stream - rotates through an eclectic schedule of hourly genre shows including jazz, punk and electronic, as well as specialty shows such as top of the month and new uploads
&gt;electronic - rotates through several blocks of electronic genres from ambient and avante garde to house and dubstep
&gt;rock - rotates through several blocks or rock genres including metal
&gt;hip hop / rap - plays hip hop and rap blocks of music

OK, there are plenty of exceptions. With that said, girls hold huge leverage in social settings and have to be picky or you end up with a turkey. In short, as they say, if you don’t ask you don’t get. Don’t be above having a strategy that lets you find out what type of stuff the
guy is made of – when you’re in a position to assess the outcome and not get stuck. I’m not a big one for thinking that you can change people’s personalities so
run for the hills…  
  
1. Arranges dates and cancels with either no excuse or lame excuse. Reason: Unreliable and doesn’t mind putting others out - a nasty character flaw. Being let somewhere waiting is not acceptable (unless he calls on the phone an apologizes profusely.  
2. Shows up on date stoned or drunk – REASON: More interested in having fun than making a good impression and is irresponsible. If you are going to get toasted at least do it together.  
3. Is mean
4. Lies about stuff – little stuff or big stuff
5. Would rather play video games than go out or do something involving real exercise. REASON: This is a future couch potato in the making – lose the dead weight now.  
6. Quits jobs without any other employment lined up or doesn’t take a job because it is “below him.” REASON: Lazy and looks for excuses to avoid work. If you want to be fighting about $$$ for the rest of your life or subsidize that sloth while you’re working - keep dating.  
7. When you’re out on a date or at a party he pays more attention to his friends (male or female) than he does to you . REASON: He’s not that interested and is just marking time.  
8. Doesn’t pay for dates. REASON: The guy’s a cheapskate and that makes life a bummer. Even when I was pretty broke in College the guys paid for the dates; sometimes
9. Looks like crap when he picks you up. REASON: Making a good impression on a potential mate is a fundamental condition in nature. You work hard to attract the females of choice. If he doesn’t make the effort now
want to be near is someone with poor hygiene or who doesn’t like to shower – cooties galore.  
10. Likes to grub off others rather than paying his own way
11. The flip side – has a lot of $$$ but doesn’t have an explanation for where it comes from. REASON: The dude deals with shady people and you don’t want to be anywhere near that crew.  
12. Doesn’t like anything that involves hard work. Likes to gamble or looks for the easy buck. REASON: When there’s kids at home and the money gets tight he’s going to bail -- shortly after taking the last few $$$ and betting them on a horse.  
13. He likes to brag about what he is good at and doesn’t show much interest in your stuff. REASON: Keep away from the self centered bullshit artists. If he has to talk himself up or put others down
14. Asks you to meet him somewhere rather than picking you up; Doesn’t call to find out whether you’re home safe if you have to travel a distance
doesn’t care that much or doesn’t like to be inconvenienced – either way boot him.

Compromise is one of the keys to a happy life. No one gets what they want all the time. Some guys try to.

1. Smiles and is nice to people pretty much all the time.  
2. Looks out for you and is protective of you (NOT POSSESSIVE)  
3. Is intelligent and is interested in learning stuff  
4. Makes an effort to keep you happy and to do fun things  
5. Is reliable for you and friends (keeps his word)  
6. Has some idea on what he wants to do with his life  
7. Has nice friends (Friends are a reflection)  
8. Misses you when you’re not there (calls but not annoyingly)  
9. Does things well and is not a quitter (Skills are the key to success)  
10. Is willing to work hard to get where he wants to go  
11. Is independent and wants you to be independent too  
12. Has a good relationship with his family  
  
I’m sure there are other good attributes but these are some key ones. Hope this helps.

  
edit:  Wow, however, never make these counterpoints to my dad because he will not be willing to listen to them.  :)

Me and my friend were catching a late showing of spiderman. Literally as the movie ended the fire alarm went off. We went outside and it was total chaos. people were running and screaming everywhere. we started to make our way through the crowd when we hear murmurings of shots being fired. Right then an 18 year old girl and her friend stumbled up next to us. She had been shot in the leg. i was in shock. we helped her sit down and i ran through the crown to find some help. i saw more people iinjured. officers ignored me as they were still mounting an entry. we finally found help and were asked to help carry her to a staging area. there were several people already there. blood everywhere. ah. this is crazy. finally the iinjured were taken to the hospital. i let several victims use my phone. it was iintense watching them call their loved ones laying on the ground bleeding. things have calmed down that was a while ago. now everyone is waiting to have their info taken so they can leave. lots of cops. helicopters. talks of a bomb(?!). anyway just wanted to make a post while processing. i have video i will post when i get home.



EDIT: Wow, almost exactly where the victims were being taken. They didn't know, they couldn't of, but knowing that now is crazy. He had explosives in his car. We helped carry a victim there and we were helping out. In all the chaos no officers seemed to mind and we got out of the way when the girls and the guy we were assisting were taken away in a police cruiser. 

I have never seen violence on this scale in my life. Never seen a gunshot, running, pushing, agony. Just trying to put it all together just when a victim stumbled into us. When she said she was shot I just couldn't grasp it. I saw the wound and I couldn't grasp it. All credit goes to my friend who kept his cool and composure. He really showed his true colors and did everything he could to help. THere were many others with the same attitude, so thanks to all of them as well. A nurse came and assisted us as well as others. With all the negativity tonight I also saw some very moving warmth.

**First**, that is not what happened. From what I can tell, the black guy was sitting towards the back by himself and took offense to what seems to be a pretty racist comment from Mr. 67 years old, whom it seems was originally in the front of the bus but then came back  to get in this altercation (black guy: ""go back up front""). The black man actually seems to be somewhat more withdrawn in the beginning, but is goaded enough that he responds. Mr. 67 then continues to trade insults and eventually the guy comes up front and takes an ill-advised swing, after which Mr. 67 pummels the black man long after he's clearly no longer a threat.

Watch the girl's second video and see if that changes your mind at all about Mr. 67: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5fnjFVPCek&amp;feature=channel

It kinda seems to me like Mr. 67 is maybe a little imbalanced or possibly on something, but I think we maybe need to stop thinking about this as black guy attacks poor old white guy and gets beat.

**Second**, but I was pretty surprised to see so many n-bombs and watermelon jokes thrown around. It's the sort of stuff you expect from a YouTube comment board. I really think that shit is uncalled for. And we really don't know much about the guy at all, other than that he wears corn rows, patronizes public transit, and maybe can be too proud to back down.

Also: many comments have revolved around the idea that white folks suffer from a lot of racism that is ignored because they're in the majority. I think that's kinda bullshit--maybe there is somewhat of a double standard, but if an alien were to take a guess about the state of our society based on these comment strings, they'd think that whites were some terribly oppressed race. 

I'm sorry to be such a Debby Downer. I usually have nothing but respect for your wisdom and wit

Clarification: I don't mean to suggest the other man was without fault--very much to the contrary. My points were intended to be: a) I don't think there was a clear right and wrong party here

So she goes to the counter, 1 large fry, 1 large coke, 2 apple pies and a parfait.

I shake my head, but before she can get the words out her mother says ""We can't afford that! She will have what I am having.""

Now, and heard the following exchange as the mother/daughter couple ate their food.

D: I didn't want this. I wanted a salad.

M: You will eat this and be fucking happy about it

D: Mom

M: I WORK ALL DAY TO FEED YOU WELL AND YOU ARE NEVER HAPPY

M: Oh So now you are a fucking anorexic

D: I'm not anorexic! I just don't want to be fat!

M: Eat that food

That mother pissed me off so much. There are so many fat kids I see on a day to day, and she was being forced by her mother to be fat. I swear, it was one of the most disgusting displays of bad parenting I have ever seen.

At around 11:30 pm, and I tell him I am going to go poo. Nothing unusual.

I go to the toilet and do my business. I try to wipe myself as clean as possible because I was about to go to sleep - this unfortunately leads to the toilet being clogged. Great. It didn't seem that clogged as the water level barely raised. I flushed again thinking the water pressure would push the clog down. **It didn't.** The water overflowed. I rushed to my room

I go on my computer and look up ways to unclog a toilet without a plunger

This did not turn out so well. The pressure needed to blow a bag underwater is pretty large. I heard someone walked in. The toilet is inside a stall so he couldn't see me, I unravel the spiral binding on one of my notebooks and try using it to push the clog through the drain. The binding was not rigid enough and just kept bending when I tried shoving it through the drain. 

Realizing I had a lot of studying to do, I am able to cup my hands around the drain. Using rapid fire palm push kamehamehas, I pushed like I was pressing A during a Mario Party Minigame. After 2 minutes, I hear the water flowing. A slow trickle turned into a godly rush as the water level rapidly lowered. I flushed the toilet to hear the satisfying sound of water draining through the toilet. I stood up like a champ at my accomplishment, but knew on the inside that I was defeated. I look at my watch and realize it is 12:20 am. I have spent the last moments of my teenage life, and the first 20 minutes of my birthday, unclogging a toilet with my bare hands.

My son was born 13 years and some change ago. I remember the minute he was born

He's always been a very smart kid. He was reading novels at six or seven years old. When he does his work, with exotic cars. He can literally name you every model from every manufacturer that makes an exotic car. Not only that, he can give you almost all of the specs on them. Engine size, type of transmission, etc.

When he was 5 or 6, they diagnosed him with being ""in the autistic spectrum"". I refused to believe it. I blamed everything on his lack of being able to hear for so long and that he was just having normal kid issues. As the years went by in elementary school, he developed almost no friends. He has no idea how to start a conversation with someone about something that does not interest him. He has NO idea how to make small talk. He is very short with people when they talk to him. his grades only suffer when he refuses to turn things in, or forgets stuff. Which he does on a pretty consistent basis. during this whole time, my wife made sure that he was getting therapy for his social issues and what not...totally against my wishes. I just thought he was having normal kid issues.

Now he's in middle school. he is on the student council. in the jazz band. in concert band. I made him run cross country this year, but he has gotten in trouble here and there because he is rude to teachers and because he has minor meltdowns. Kids will tease him, and he just flips the fuck out. Little shit too. They will say his name over and over, and so he stood up in class, flipped his desk over and threw a pencil at the kid. 

Anyway, but I was too proud to try.

he lives with me. I have one other son who has no ""issues"". I spend a load of time with both of them. I love my kids more than anything else in the world. My son with the issues has been getting counseling for about 6 months now

Not looking for pity. I just wanted to get this off of my chest and finally admit somewhere that I was wrong. I won't be ""treating"" him any differently at all

I was told that if I went across the street to the grocery store and bought a pair of cheap shoes that he would let me into the bar. Normally I would have said fuck it

I end up going to the back of the bar

He tells me to come with him to his car because he has some shoes for me. Sure enough this guy has a pair of shoes that fit me that he was willing to let me wear for the night. At this point I am so happy that I got a pair of shoes and can go in to the bar and enjoy my friends birthday. I offer my new friend a shot and a beer to thank him for the shoes, etc.

1300221984.0,g4nk2,So my mother took me out to lunch to let me know that she's been having a secret relationship for years with an ex who abused me as a child...,MyEFingFamily,607,300,236,"After a few moments of drowning in a flood of unleashed memories...

MyEFingMom: ""He's a different man

Me: ""Oh

MyEFingMom: ""(my name)!""

Me: ""Well then what does he feel so bad about that he has to go to church every day?""

MyEFingMom: ""It's not that he feels bad

Me: ""Yeah

MyEFingMom: ""I'm bringing him by for lunch sometime this weekend

Me: ""Ummm

MyEFingMom: ""I'll let you know when so you don't have to be there if you don't want to.""

Me: ""Ummm

MyEFingMom: ""It's not your choice

Me: ""Look

MyEFingMom: Blank look

Me: ""No it's not my choice, is that clear? If he wants to apologize to my grandmother for getting caught beating me right in front of her, you can take her out to lunch and he can meet you. I not interested in, willing, or able to forgive to either of you. Someone who would fuck over a defenseless child and someone who would turn their head and allow their own child to be abused, deserves nothing, least of all forgiveness. What do you think I've been working out for all these years? I've been waiting for the day I can rip one of their throats out, bring him by

The only problem was that I was serious. Completely serious. It freaked me out that I had so much rage

I hadn't thought about it in at least 10 years. It was as though I was a shaken up bottle of liquid rage and she popped the cork with only a few words. For the first time in 30 years, it was something like ""oh shit... it has feelings... I didn't know that... perhaps I've been approaching this all wrong...""

Clearly scared of me, I'm a Buddhist, and pro-gun control. I meditate and do yoga regularly. I'm anti-war, and claim to be anti-violence, but I'm not sure where I fall on this anymore since apparently there are people out there that my feelings would override reason and classify as kill on sight without question or mercy. It sounds dramatic, but the point is that it caused an internal double-take at the irony of ""peace and love, but these people should die in a fire without question.""

Does that make sense? What does that make me? A sociopath? A ticking time bomb? I've never been violent, but I've never directed physical aggression at a person because I couldn't bring myself to hurt another. I've wanted to, but I couldn't bring myself to. That's a strange contradiction when contrasted with my uninhibited homicidal feelings toward my moms abusive boyfriends (there was more than one).

You may be wondering why I'm 30 and still dealing with this. The only reason I'm not on the other side of the planet and away from this bullshit is because the people who ended up raising me now need help. My grandparents only have a few years left and are completely disabled. They have no one to help them, regardless of what I have to put up with from the nightmare that is my family. Don't get me wrong though, they're just as messed up and manipulative as the rest. They did a good number on me when I was a child by turning me against my mom, for my own good of course (gag). All our family dysfunction comes from them, but at least they took care of me rather than just getting me high or physically beating me into submission. With them it was all head games of control and fear. Grandma would use drunk grandpa as a threat, and since I was already scared of men in general, having found that each had a new and creative way to harm me, and even came to pity them for not being able to comprehend that their disgusting abusive actions in raising my mom would somehow impact my life. They're just very old school people who were raised under Nazi occupation. Not to mention that they're so far gone that none of it makes sense anymore. They just want to love and be loved

As you can imagine, since it's in the slave owners interest to keep the slave healthy and happy. In business, you get to go to the next person lining up (to be a salve) when one is unhappy of loses health. The business world is juts about who you can fuck over and how to get away with it. I speak from experience. I was tricked into resigning from an 80k/year programming job just because of an unrelated accident that landed me in the hospital for longer than my boss was willing to put up with. He brought some paperwork by during a visit that he had me sign while I was drugged out of my mind. It was a forged resignation, which prevented me from getting unemployment benefits, an act which eventually landed me living in my car and friends couches, effectively homeless. What was I going to do? Sue the crap out of a guy who has nothing and runs his business purely on credit and always in the red?

I'll close this before I completely digress. I want to learn something from all this, vengeance, justice, sorrow, remorse vs selective remorse, and not being able to shake the morally disgusting fact that everyone turns a blind eye to each others brutality so long as it suits their ends. This whole world is fucked and I look forward to the day I'm free of all of it. A growing part of me wants to tell my mom and her new old boyfriend, ""I'll forgive you if you get the fuck out of the rest of my life, you didn't seem to have trouble at all doing it for the first half."" I just don't see myself ever being able to accept her as my mother after she shattered me as a child

I'm not the one that fucked me over.. and over... and over... to the point where it took me 12 years as an adult and the destruction of hundreds of friendships to figure it all out. As I see it, and they can't deal with it, then too fucking bad for them. I'm not going to convince myself to live a lie in order to make them feel better about themselves. Fuck their egos. They were able to force me to do that as a child, which is perhaps the reason why they continue to try and force me into that role today.

Am I nuts? Am I losing it? Am I more on track than I think? Anyone have suggestions? I'm sure I'm not the first or last to go through something like this? How did you learn to thrive in life after this kind of thing? How did you learn to trust in anything or anyone?

﻿Greetings Australian Government Officials

Australia's laws on internet censorship are already among the most restrictive in the western world. Their government filters more internet content than any other Parliamentary Democracy. For some elements within the Government

Anonymous' concern with this legislature is twofold.

First

More importantly, as the production the titles that have been affected are heavily regulated to ensure the age of the models. Instead they are relying on earlier ambiguous wording that allows pornography featuring models that ""appear to be"" under 18 years of age to be treated in the same manner as actual child pornography. 

The repercussions of this censorship of a natural body type on the psyche of Australian women cannot be understated

After the cliffhanger she left me, my problems suddenly seeming as serious as tiddlywinks compared to her tribulations. She reached out her hand indicating she wanted the book back. I handed it over and she tentatively put it back on the shelf, still looking at it. 

I didn't say anything more. It was not my place to, cold, cynically disdainful. 

A small, pale, hagard. She looked like someone you would see representing the 'after' on a poster about Meth addiction. I watched the young girl get up. With the way the old woman's back coiled, she was as tall as her and it was a strange sight seeing them walk out the bookstore.

I got to the party a little late, she brought me up to her room, got on her bed. She invited me over, then essentially pulled me down. Normally, this obviously would mean something but since she rejected my twice before I was in denial and did nothing but let her cuddle me. Eventually she starts to feel my chest, then belly, then she keeps going lower. I realize she is probably drunk though the only way I can tell is that she wouldn't do this sober. So I say no, saying she wants me inside her and other things. I start to think back, as in I was sure I was not good enough for her. My low self esteem said no. I tried to get up

There are two worst parts to this story. First,) she texted me to thank me. And that I was right, and she was just drunk and wanted a fuck buddy to boost her own self esteem. I'm not sure if I'm happy I didn't sleep with someone who was drunk, or happy that I didn't sleep with someone who wanted to use me, or sad that it was fake. Just thought I'd share.

TLDR: My dad has been putting generic cheese in the Kraft cheese wrapper for a decade in order to prove the women in my family can't really tell a difference between Kraft &amp; generic American Cheese.

Edit: I am amazed by how many people care that I eat processed cheese! FYI: I use ""real"" cheese for all of my cooking needs except for when I am making a grilled cheese. I prefer the ""fake"" cheese when it comes to a grilled cheese. It is a conscious choice, when I choose Kraft. I simply prefer it.

She lost hers for a day once.  It was not a pretty apartment when she was done looking for it but she found it.

Now the story

She knows that I have been going to a jeweler for a while so I let her overhear a ""conversation"" that I was disappointed a ring was on backorder.  Little did she know that it was already in the house.  The next morning I stole her claddagh ring while she was in the shower.

She went through her normal routine for the rest of the morning and finally went to get her ring and began to flip out.  She was looking everywhere

Finally, and froze.  

She opened it as she turned around

She said yes.

Then cried.

1303068124.0,gs7fl,"For those of you with strabismus (lazy eye). I lived the last 15 years of my life being self conscious about my worsening condition.  I had no idea that I could get my eyes realigned until someone finally said something. So now I'm saying it for you, get the alignment surgery.",wildncrazyguy,331,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/gs7fl/for_those_of_you_with_strabismus_lazy_eye_i_lived/, my mom scrounged up enough money to get the realignment surgery. Everything went pretty great for those first 14 years of life or so. I didn't realize anything different about my eyes

Hand/eye coordination was always hard, for me, is still pretty much up in he air, literally. But one thing that really helped with the hand eye coordination was video games, I spent hours playing my favorites until I beat them, and back when I played often, I was one of the best players in my group of friends. But hand-eye coordination never came easy

Fast forward to around age 14. We had moved around a lot and I was displaced from the friends I had made through school. This final location that we moved to was very rural and only 3 or so families in town had kids in my age range. Meeting people meant traveling an hour down the mountain to the nearest big town. Bored and with too much time on my hand, trying to find an apt punishment for staying out late with my friends. My grandmother, with a few drinks already rolling through her system, in a particularly harsh tone said something like ""straighten your eyes, you Mom paid good money for that surgery."" This was the first time that anyone had said anything about it, and it struck me, hard. It was painful, because I was already dealing with all of the physical modifications puberty has to offer. This stuck with me

But it just kept getting worse and worse. Sometimes I would talk to people and they would ask ""Are you looking at me? Or, people avoid people that are ""different"" or that sympathetic ""your handicapped"" looks washes over their face. 

So I had my solutions for a time, you don't know how many times I'd heard that freaking 80's song sung or whistled in my direction. Or I'd use the muscles in m eyes that I had and cross my eyes, and this worked somewhat, until I'd forget, or I'd blink, and the eyes would move and freak people out. I thought I was doomed to living like this for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, no matter how hard I tried or what I was able to accomplish

Until it wasn't. About a year and a half ago, why would I need to wait to move to California? I had insurance, surely there was a professional around here that could do it. And so I began to look for a physician in the area, and I found one that was rated excellent all over the Internet. 

He mostly worked with children, about their kids, and it seems adults just usually are okay with one surgery, or they just deal with their condition. It was a little crazy to think, after 28 years, that I could get this fixed. He took a look over the eyes, ran some tests

Surgery happened 3 months later, I was looking forward to not being defined by the way I look. The surgery was done in 2 hours. I got up walked to the car, took it easy for the week, and by the next week, I was back to work.

It wasn't painful in the least. The muscles felt ""tight"" for a while and my eye was red for about 2 months,000 which insurance covered for about 60% of it. The drawback is that I may have to have surgery again in another five years or so, time will tell.

Seriously, I feel better, and I can now look into people's eyes without the fear. And I don't have to wear my sunglasses at night anymore.

Here are a few pics:

A few random things to know about her. She's an old Boheme, though she loves my husband, and would often say to him, ""If I were younger, I might have gone for you."" This statement would send my husband into a fit of shudders, mostly because Blanche is not known for her hygiene. So, to make him feel better, ""You know

Sometimes when we did a favor for her, she would push it toward me and say, ""Give this to the man."" (I am referred to as ""The Girl"").

I was getting rid of some landscaping blocks and advertised them for free to anyone willing to carry them away. A lovely woman responded, were black. 

Blanche turned her trusty lawn chair so it faced our backyard, until I happened to look out the window.

He recounted the conversation: 

“The Girl let you come in her yard?” Blanche said.  

“Yes ma’am.” 

“I don’t like the blacks. Can’t trust the darkies one bit. Got that one trying to be president.”

“Yes

“Course the blacks are better than the Mexicans. Goddamn Mexicans all over this neighborhood. Don’t do a goddamn thing

1309537357.0,ieb9w,3 weeks ago I traded my sit-down desk for a stand-up desk. These are my observations.,pingsmoth,486,189,207,"I recently started using a standing desk at my office job after having a traditional sit-down desk for almost two years.  For the past 7 months I have used an exercise ball as my chair, but I thought it might give some insight for those who are wondering about switching to a standing desk.

**Physical Health**
I move around more.  Before this desk, there would be a twinge of hesitation.  Do I really need it enough to justify getting up from my sitting position? Often the answer would be Yes, but more than I would like I would just remain stationary, thinking ""I'll get it later.""  Now there is no barrier to me getting up from my desk since I'm already on my feet.  I just walk over and get what I need and come back.  I also find myself shifting back and forth at my desk far more often, whether it's moving from side to side to get to different computer screens or just shifting my weight.  Before this I would often have parts of my legs fall asleep from inactivity due to excessive sitting. 

My legs hurt.  Perhaps this will abate with time, and I was only sore after very long shifts.  I assume my body will adjust once again to being in a standing position all day, but high school was more than a decade ago and I'm not getting any younger, so perhaps the soreness is just a byproduct of age.

I feel hungry more.  Studies on how much energy is required to stand vs. sit all day come to various conclusions, and by the end of the day I feel just a little more worn out than I used to.  Mind you, I don't exactly move around a whole lot at my office job, and I'm not comparing this to a manual labor job which requires constant physical activity.  But I can certainly tell a difference between using a standing desk and sitting all day.

Stairs are a breeze.  Like I said, but now I can bound up those stairs like it's nothing.  I have to stress that correlation is not necessary causation, and it's entirely possible my standing desk has nothing at all to do with climbing stairs easier.  But it is something I have observed, hence its inclusion here.

**Physiological Effects**
I am more alert, but a general sense of lethargy.  I would move slower and generally not be as productive as I could be.  Now I feel much more alert and active throughout the day, just because I'm standing instead of sitting.  I also find it easier to concentrate on one thing at a time, but for tasks that require prolonged intense thought and focus I think a sitting position is better.  That's just me, though, and your results may differ.

I can multitask easier.  I don't know why, then that for 10 minutes, etc."" Now I can more easily slide between multiple projects at once, giving my attention to a variety of activities without losing focus like I used to.  If I had to guess I would say this is due to increased awareness overall since I am standing and more alert in general.

**Interpersonal Communication**
Conversations with people have taken on a whole new dynamic.  Maybe this is just me, or just chat for a bit.  I would often stand up so I could be at eye level  but that felt weird too, as if I had to pause what I was doing in order to talk with someone.  If I needed to show a coworker something on my computer, he or she would have to lean down and look at my screen while I sat there, and it just felt a little strange.  Now, conversations have taken on a much more natural quality.  Again, this is probably just me and your mileage will vary, and people will come over and rest an arm on my desk as we discuss a topic or I help them with a question. We can spread documents out and examine them together without the awkwardness that comes from one person standing and one person sitting at a desk.  It has made interpersonal interaction much more enjoyable and natural.

**Conclusion**
I realize plenty of people have jobs that necessitate standing all day but for anyone who works at a traditional desk, and I'm sure other Redditors who use stand-up desks will have their own opinions too.

**Edit**: Thanks for the comments, especially while at work.

**Edit 2**: Some commenters have mentioned the idea of sitting down at various points during the day. The desk I have is motorized and allows the user to raise and lower it throughout the day. My work was originally looking at purchasing a standing-only desk,False,,t5_2qh96,True,,,t3_ieb9w

These were made under the kirkland brand and sold at Costco stores.   They were so good, and then gave them to a homeless guy that hangs out by my office. I then bought 40 pairs of these beauties.  Lo and behold, after 2 years, my supply has dwindled and Costco doesn't carry them anymore....opting for a much thinner, inferior sock.  

Does anyone know where to get more of these? How about suggesting a suitable replacement that has the features outlined in the above photo?

Google has left me empty handed.   

Help me reddit

EDIT: [GodOfAtheism](http://www.reddit.com/user/GodOfAtheism) has provided me with a link that seems to be the real deal. I have provided him with a small gold token of appreciation.  Why I couldn't find that after searching google is beyond me.   It's painful that there is a $20 premium over what I bought them for, and you may also receive a little surprise in your inbox. 

EDIT2:  I've received quite a few comments and PM's about how I could use up socks so quickly.  As I've explained, the rest were simply worn out.  It's been slightly over 2 years.   Roughly about 700 days.  Now if we concede a fairly generous sock attrition count of 4 pairs lost to dryer fairies and hamper elves we're left with 36 pairs.  Based on a loose count, I've burned through about half of those.  (The slightest hole or tear is cause for an immediate discard)  So I've used up 18 pairs in 700 days. This means I wear each pair about 39 times before I wear them out.  The socks I wore before were lucky to make through 20 wash/wear cycles.  What made me come here was the realization that as the number of good pairs starts to dwindle, the wear cycle doubles for the smaller available pool of socks.

1345212442.0,ydkre,Today my Brother was declared terminally ill. I ask Reddit to share this story and show him support ( PICS ),coltonomnom,484,192,108,"It all started 13 years ago when my brother was just a kid at the age of 4. He started getting headaches, he received 2 major brain surgeries

Fast forward to this last September. He started getting strange symptoms and sensations on the left side of his body that included numbness, we went for an MRI scan. We sat down to talk with doctors and again received some awful news.

Your son has cancer. 

To me this was horrible news. The absolute worst, the tumour had actually grown into and around his brain in the thalamus area which plays a large role in all motor skills. As the tumour grew, his whole left side of his body started to deteriorate to the point where he was not mobile. He was forced out of going to the gym, tracking and field, running, lifting weights. He lost all quality of life at this point being an active teenager. 

Again, to most, this would mean his tumour was shrinking, relieving pressure around the thalamus. But after yet another MRI, the tumour had actually grown even more, but the chemotherapy had actually taken down a good portion of the swelling, relieving some of the symptoms.

Next step was radiation. Seeing as he had it once before, again, were getting worse. He was at his all time worst during the first treatment of radiation. I can't explain how bad his symptoms had been. He had told me in the hotel they were staying at, he was hallucinating about the whole room being a large chess game, and each piece of furniture was a chess piece. His left side of his body was having tremors from the swelling being so bad. After a couple weeks of daily radiation, his symptoms started to become less prominent, again. He was getting progressively better

Few weeks after radiation

So, seeing as thats the only way we can see what is going on upstairs. Doctors were astounded. His tumour had completely shrunk to the size of pretty well nothing. Although, some scar tissue left, that was all that was left. They told us he was cancer free. We went home with absolute joy, it was like nothing could stop us now. We beat not 1, but 2 brain tumours? One being cancerous?

Nope. Recently his left sided symptoms had come back. Being absolutely paranoid by this point, but time will only tell.

Now, treatment after treatment, heart ache after heart ache, he never complains about anything. He puts other people before himself. Even today, being told he is terminal, he finds a way to add that positive swing on it. He has done so much for the hospitals, whether it be fundraising, any time of volunteer work when he can. He did public speaking for schools, going to school to become a civil engineer

I just want to raise awareness to his story. And how hard it has been for everyone, or for family. And I would love to hear from them. And like I said, i'm sure he will be reading this story, so be sure to send lots of love his way.

Thanks so much reddit.

I will keep this story shorter for the sake of posting so forgive the lack of gravitas in the delivery.


When I was in High school me


There were some life vests buckled onto some of the rafts for handholds and as we are cruising past one of them became...unbuckled. We moored maybe a quartermile upriver and immediatly the dads were discussing who would take the speedboat to go get the lifevest back. Upon their return with the vest they told all of us hormonal teenage nerd boys that the boat was indeed ""covered in naked women."" We decided to immediatly set out for a closer look.


Unfortunately the shore was quite steep and covered in shale so while my friends left with a pair of binoculars i turned around, nerdy, star wars obsessed high schooler with little direct woman skillz and i am paddling a beeline for a nakedwomanhouseboat in the middle of nowhere with all of my friends watching an no plan to speak of.


I began thinking, not sound rediculous to borrow, and be an ingredient in spanish rice.


AN ONION.


I looked back and saw my friends watching through the binoculars and commenced paddling. As I neared the nakedwomanhouseboat it briefly occured to me that I must look fucking rediculous paddling with my hands up to this boat while lying on my belly on a 3-person raft. Didnt care


I paddled up to shore and walked up the plank to the ""front door"" of their boat and knocked on the door.
I have to say this now
The door was opened by an absolutely gorgeous and quite naked woman. In hindsight the whole situation played out as if everything was completely normal. She asked me who i was with a smile and I told here about our spanish rice conundrum. She turns to go find an onion and as she is BENT OVER looking through the cupboards and cabinets I see a couple of other woman just kicking it. They act like I am the second person that day to ask to borrow an onion and go about their business. I think one was reading a book.


Right as the nakeddooranswerer says she found an onion one of the doors in the nakedwomanhouseboat opened and a man and woman

Let me start off by saying I'm not a very emotional person. When things go wrong, I feel like I just need somebody to turn to. 

Here goes. So my girlfriend of 4 years hits me out of the blue this morning with ""if something might be seriously wrong with me

She tells me that she hasn't been feeling all that great lately so she went in for a physical. They did an ultrasound on her and found 'something' on her pancreas. They say it could be a number of things including an infection, an infection or cancer (all 3 of these have similar symptoms). I'm sure the vast majority of you know, but pancreatic cancer patients die within 5 years 9/10 times if not caught early.

She already had an MRI and will get the results on Monday at the latest and will also get a biopsy on Monday. They told her the MRI might be able to tell them what it is but there is no guarantee other than the biopsy results. She doesn't want to talk about it more than she has to right now and she doesn't want anybody we know finding out about it just yet (understandable).

I don’t know how this account amasses so much karma

Bottom line: by its own admission

Karma is an odd thing. It’s an imaginary or arbitrary reward given to users of the site by users of the site. It is not redeemable for anything and more often than not is the product of chance, it should be obvious even before this took place that it is just here to observe the community and its reaction to various comments – what works, what doesn’t. I’d have to imagine that the person behind the account takes great pleasure in participating and joining in the fun – the absolute last thing on Earth I’d ever want to do is be the catalyst to taking that pleasure away. Least of all instigate a witch hunt.

I humbly ask that we let this one go. Begrudge, expand our minds, and participate in the Reddit community. What that might entail is something completely different to absolutely everyone here.

I feel that I owe an apology to the Reddit moderators and administrators. In the heat of the excitement over the last 24 hours, especially anything targeting the TiR account in a negative way. Please do not target moderators or administrators either. They are looking out for everyone’s best interest and just want to keep peace.

EDIT again - why the hell is there a strikethrough on the title? Sorry Reddit.

Jack Layton's final letter to all Canadians:

Dear Friends
Tens of thousands of Canadians have written to me in recent weeks to wish me well. I want to thank each and every one of you for your thoughtful, my spirit, and my determination.

Unfortunately my treatment has not worked out as I hoped. So I am giving this letter to my partner Olivia to share with you in the circumstance in which I cannot continue.

I recommend that Hull-Aylmer MP Nycole Turmel continue her work as our interim leader until a permanent successor is elected.

I recommend the party hold a leadership vote as early as possible in the New Year, renew our party and our program, and move forward towards the next election.

A few additional thoughts:

To other Canadians who are on journeys to defeat cancer and to live their lives, and focused on the future. My only other advice is to cherish every moment with those you love at every stage of your journey, as I have done this summer.

To the members of my party: we’ve done remarkable things together in the past eight years. It has been a privilege to lead the New Democratic Party and I am most grateful for your confidence, universal health care, public pensions and making sure no one is left behind. Let’s continue to move forward. Let’s demonstrate in everything we do in the four years before us that we are ready to serve our beloved Canada as its next government.

To the members of our parliamentary caucus: I have been privileged to work with each and every one of you. Our caucus meetings were always the highlight of my week. It has been my role to ask a great deal from you. And now I am going to do so again. Canadians will be closely watching you in the months to come. Colleagues

To my fellow Quebecers: On May 2nd, together. You have elected a superb team of New Democrats to Parliament. They are going to be doing remarkable things in the years to come to make this country better for us all.

To young Canadians: All my life I have worked to make things better. Hope and optimism have defined my political career, and your ideas for change. More and more, you are engaging in politics because you want to change things for the better. Many of you have placed your trust in our party. As my time in political life draws to a close I want to share with you my belief in your power to change this country and this world. There are great challenges before you, from the overwhelming nature of climate change to the unfairness of an economy that excludes so many from our collective wealth, and the changes necessary to build a more inclusive and generous Canada. I believe in you. Your energy, your vision, your passion for justice are exactly what this country needs today. You need to be at the heart of our economy, and our plans for the present and the future.

And finally, justice, and opportunity. We can build a prosperous economy and a society that shares its benefits more fairly. We can look after our seniors. We can offer better futures for our children. We can do our part to save the world’s environment. We can restore our good name in the world. We can do all of these things because we finally have a party system at the national level where there are real choices; where your vote matters; where working for change can actually bring about change. In the months and years to come, New Democrats will put a compelling new alternative to you. My colleagues in our party are an impressive, committed team. Give them a careful hearing; consider the alternatives; and consider that we can be a better, fairer, more equal country by working together. Don’t let them tell you it can’t be done.

First a little background.

A few months ago I approached police after becoming aware of a group of guys molesting kids. One of these people was a police officer (&amp; a senior one at that). I believe the investigation was a sham &amp; the matter is currently before an anti-corruption body.

I have since moved, due to the seniority of the officer concerned, am not convinced I can rely on the current investigation into the police investigation.

Here's the thing. I have in my possession a recording of these people discussing having me killed (yes

I have been looking around for quotes for forensic work. I can't afford it! I am broke (unemployed).

I realize this is an odd request

This is not some pathetic troll or conjob. I am serious

I have uploaded some snippets from the audio (as wav files)

http://www.mediafire.com/?wsim33rgx6h2x

If anyone can help me with cleaning these up... well I may just owe you my life

UPDATE - OK so people are asking how i came to know this info. Fair enough question. I will not lie

I have had serious psychological issues since i was a kid. When I was a child I sexually acted out against other children. Luckily their was intervention before any real damage was done. You can probably guess why I was acting out like that, mainly due to my sexual issues. I became homeless a few years ago &amp; found accommodation in a ""group"" home. The house next door was managed by the same organisation. A guy next door ""Malcolm Sporle"", picked up on me somehow. I have no idea how, we just talked a few times about my general history. I thought at first I'd found someone who would really understand me - then he started revealing his history to me. The guy had been abusing kids since his 20's. I talked to someone I trust about what to do, &amp; was advised to anonymously tip off the cops after I moved into my own place (which I was already on the waiting list for). So there you go - I guess you could call me a ""pervert"", but I have NEVER acted out as an adult &amp; was repulsed by what this guy revealed to me. That's why I wen't to the cops. Please try to understand, I hate myself because of these feelings, in a way I felt I had something to prove (by going to the police). please try to understand these feeling are not my choice &amp; have ruined my life :(

UPDATE2 - Here's a screenshot of a blog post I saved about this guy before I went to the cops. It's now been taken down. it says EVERYTHING about him &amp; his mates.

http://img841.imageshack.us/img841/4581/72137588.jpg

UPDATE3 - OK thanks for those who are offering useful advise/trying to assist. Doesn't look hopeful as far as what I was initially after. To the amateur psychiatrists out there - I think the professionals I have been seeing for the last 10 odd years have a better idea about what's going on. Then again I know everyone online is an armchair expert.

UPDATE4 - OK so heres the link to the full, is where one of my former flatmate's gives ""Trevor"" (one of the pervs), the key to my door. These guys had been doing they're best to convince David/Mark whom I was living with that I was the molester. In fact, ""Trevor"" attempted to convince Mark to harm me. Pretty smart on their part, trying to get a guy with schizophrenia to harm me, even if something went wrong who would believe poor Mark? This Trevor guy defiantly also said, nearer the end of their conversation however that it was better to ""stay away from kids"", would screw them. If it is salvageable that is.

Back story: My parents met when they were 22, my mother would cheat on my dad if he did anything wrong - For example: ""You stayed late at work and left me with Daughter1, you're worthless."" And she would go find a boyfriend. 

My dad refused to leave her for 3 reasons: 1 - if he left, head over hills, in love with her. 

He was never perfect

Back to now, whatever it takes to please my mother. He was late paying the phone bill this month and the phone company called her. She called Dad, screamed that she didn't need to deal with this, and hung up. Then, 4 hours later, sent him a text message saying, ""Why don't you love me?"" (Note: My dad and I are very close - we talk about everything.)

I was just on Facebook and saw that

Honestly, may hurt himself. I'm terrified. I live over an hour away, but I'm considering going to stay with him for a few days.

tl;dr: My mother is a horrible wife and broke up with my dad over nothing via Facebook.

(I'm sure I was not speeding) I was asked for my license, registration and insurance. I told the officer I could not furnish my license. He inquired as to why I did not have it. I informed him that I had mistakenly left it at home in my wallet. I furnished my registration and insurance information. I was also asked for my DOB because I did not have my license. 

The officer left and then came back a short time later. He then stated that I needed to perform some tests for him. He then put his thumb and forefinger in a ring form and asked me to repeat his actions. He then proceeded to use his thumb to count from one to four via touching each of his digits with his thumb

The officer asked if I had had anything to drink. I told him that I had not had anything to drink, then corrected myself and stated that I could not drink, and explained my medical situation. The officer then stated that he had seen alcohol in the vehicle and asked if I was trying to hide anything as he had seen my brother putting beer under the seat. (There were not any open containers in my vehicle.)  I was then asked to stand on one foot with the other sticking up 6 inches from the ground and count ""1000-1, 1000-2"" and so on.

He replied, he said that he had asked for my license to be run and that that was standard procedure. I replied that I understood. He stated that I probably was not in the database because I had just purchased the vehicle and that it takes time for that information to arrive at the DMV. (I registered the car 6 days before this stop.) He then proceeded to applaud by professionalism with the stop. He also stated that my ""mother should be proud"" and that I had been ""raised right"". After there were no hits after running my license, he said I was free to go.

I have some paint cans, to do this, I either have to go to one of those e-waste/hazardous waste get-togethers that occur about once every 3-4 months and are usually about 20-30 miles from my place or I have to go to one of those permanent disposal facilities also about 30 miles away. OK, this sounds simple enough- but here's the rub. You can only transport up to 15 gallons at a time. As I mentioned I have more than that. Fine- I'll make two trips. But wait, you can only dispose of 4 items at a time. That means I'll have to make about 8 trips of about 60 miles (30 miles each way) to dispose of the waste that would only take up about 1/4 of my truck bed if I could legally take it all in one trip.

I would be happy to pay any dumping fees or excessive waste fees or whatever fees they want so that I can dump the stuff legally. But this just makes me want to bury it in my trash can under my regular trash just to get rid of it. I won't do that

We found out my mom had cancer of the vulva almost 2 years ago. Everyone said that it wasn't serious that my mom was going to be fine so I moved out and my mom and I had a bit of a falling out. (I started to develop a addiction to opiates and I dated an abusive guy).

I dumped the boy and addiction and my mom and I started being okay again. She still resented me for leaving but we were okay. Now its been a year since we found out my mom had cancer. And it went into remission. 

I went to study at Job Corps. I had not yet obtained my GED and I took the Trade

I graduated March 23rd

My dad at that point had already taken all the paid leave that he could have and we needed his paycheck more then anything I could ever think of making. So I shouldered the responsibility. I am 20.

So at first my mom was fine but looking back at it she deteriorated fast. and I will not bore you with the details but she was pretty much lost her ability to communicate with us 3 weeks prior to her death and she lost her mobility about a month and a half before she passed.

So lets fast forward to about 4 days ago when I was watching my mom. She had been having some incredible days. I even got a nice picture of her smiling. She had been in a lot of pain lately though and was acting weird.

She then sneezed 3 times and started having a seizure and I realized she was bleeding out. She was bleeding from the tumor in her tummy. I freaked out and got my dad. I keep seeing that in my mind every time I see my mom.


Fast forward one more day. My dad wakes me up a 5am and tells me that my mom is gonna pass soon. I come down stairs and her eyes are rolling back in her head and she looks so scared and pale. There are tears brimming her eyes and she looks at me with almost pleading eyes. I looked into her eyes as she stops breathing. I can't get this image out of my head either.

So here we are today. 2 weeks before my 21st birthday

""I just.. er... "" he looked embarrassed

""Erm

""Sure - By the way

""Oh.. erm... £6.50"" he looked embarrassed again in case I'd assumed he thought I was thinking he wanted to ask for money.

One day a customer walked up and put down four or five items at my register. Nothing really noticeable, some duct tape. He mentioned he had a tax exempt card, and he just needed to find it. So he got out this big ass wallet and started looking. I didn't really mind, I went back to stocking the bags at my register.

Suddenly this other customer walked up with a bag of charcoal. I could tell be looking at the guy he was off. I'm certain he had some mental issues. He set his bag of charcoal down *in front of* customer 1. Closer to my register. Customer 1 didn't say anything

Out of nowhere Customer 2 grabbed Customer 1's stuff off of the counter (remember, so he turned around and ran back to the store, towards the front registers. I mean RUNNING! I was so confused! Customer 1 was still looking through his wallet (It was a HUGE wallet and the tax exempt card is just a small piece of paper). He still didn't say anything.

I tried reasoning it out in my head

Get this: He came back a minute later empty handed! He walked up the the register all casual, and then left.

Customer 1 finally found his card and looked up and asked where his stuff went. I asked him if he knew Customer 2 and he said no

I didn't set out to say that getting older is terrible. I was just giving the OP a few things to think about vis-a-vis his parents. I'd like to share a couple points about middle age that will raise your spirits and invite other mid-lifers to do the same.

For me personally, I have a great house, working vehicles, and my back porch - whoa. That place is the shit. It took years to get that porch to where it is now but it's finally coming together the way I wanted. I just love sitting on the porch on a cool evening and just watch the trees sway in the breeze.

I work from home making a decent salary so I get to take my kids to day care

A couple years ago I got a trainer to help me get in shape. Within a few months of working out and changing my diet I was in the best shape of my life! These days I don't worry too much about being competition-ready but I haven't let myself go... too far.

After the kids go to bed I watch a TV show with my wife or maybe play EVE Online if she has something else to do. I have a kegerator

Of course I've been through stuff. Some of the things I talked about in my original comment I do think about. The decade of my 20's was probably the most difficult time of my life. [My mom is gone](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/yr0ap/my_grandmother_insists_on_calling_newspapers/c5y3inz) but my dad is doing well for now. My brother and I don't talk but we don't hate each other. I pay a ton of child support for two older children.

He was an alcoholic

On a rare weekend visit, frankly, so blitzed he pushed my head through a wall. This would be my last weekend visit and the last time I would speak to him for many years.

Fast forward and it brings us to me introducing him to his grandchild when she was 18 months old. It was a lovely afternoon

Fast forward through 15 years of no contact and we find that he now has cancer and that he has a year or so left.

I call him and he promptly explains that it would have been better had I just read about his death. I explain that the past is exactly where it needs to be and that I hold no ill feelings and say good-bye.

One month later he calls and we begin our relationship for the first time. It starts with him simply saying

He died 5 years ago today

Last fall they gave me less than a day's notice of when I had to come in on a Saturday (I work M-F; 15 hours notice actually).  I did it

My immediate supervisor told me I had to come in and I told him no one told me


I'm sick of ""shutting up and being grateful to have a job"", it's not a place I want to work anyways.  I can't help but think that if I were a single mother who had to take care of her kids on the weekend, they would have told me far in advance, if not gotten someone else to do it altogether.  My time is just as valuable to me as anyone else's is to them so I should be afforded the same thing.

**Edit**: I didn't expect anyone to read this

* I have enough money saved up for a couple of months

* It's a small trucking company

* My supervisor does not set a schedule as some other jobs do.  I have a set shift that never changes, and then only Saturdays).  It's at that time that management is supposed to decide who is working those days and inform them.  Even then they can't seem to get it right.  A couple of months ago they just told the lady that does what I do, but on 1st shift, to decide.  That pissed me off.  There are 2 managers there that are supposed to do that and neither of them can do such a simple thing?

* They require ""as much notice as possible"" for any employee who wants a day off.  I think asking for 24 hours notice is reasonable.

* I work 8-9 hours per day, but I'm the only person in the front office during my shift and people are coming in and going out all the time, phones are ringing, e-mails, paperwork, dealing with truckers; the only time I ever find time to even eat anything is around an hour before I leave.  Sometimes there isn't any time at all.  Company policy states I am to get two 10 minute breaks, paid, so I have never gotten one.

* Unemployment pay is not a factor in my decision.  I think I would probably get it (I've never lost an appeal in the past)

I will be working on updating my resume this weekend and looking for jobs.  This is probably the thing I need to finally get off my ass and put real effort towards finding a better job.",,t5_2qh96,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/qft07/i_hate_my_job_denied_an_ultimatum_and_will/

For the skeptics: I know this is a controversial issue, is  that the administration has been so uncompromising in the policy's implementation - especially considering that it is based on opinion and qualitative survey responses (I have included the references provided by the school board below).

It is also worth nothing that I have received a lot of (anonymous/confidential) support from current teachers.

This is how I'm getting over it.

* **Music is your best friend or your worst enemy.** All of those songs on your computer are going to stick with you through this breakup. You can hit shuffle and find something that you love and it'll love you right back. Beware though

* **You have friends.** Your friends are right there. They want to help you. Your single friends think you're better off. Your taken friends feel bad for you. Hang out with your single friends. They will show you what you've been missing out on.

* **Go out.** Go. Nobody is going to take you out. Nobody is going to make you leave the cave of moping that your bedroom has become. You are your own event planner. Go wild. Line things up. Concerts. UFC at the bar. Parties. Whatever floats your boat. Just go do something. You used to go out and not think about your then girlfriend. You still can. It feels good and will take your mind off it. Sitting at home is not good for you or anyone. 

* **Drink.** Buy yourself a handle of something you might not typically drink. Maybe something a little too expensive for a normal week. Have a cocktail or two and ease your nerves. Don't overdo it like an asshole. Nobody likes that person. 

* **Hook up with something random.** This is for confidence. Go out. Find somebody cute and go for it. If you succeed your confidence will grow exponentially. No more thinking you're just some piece of shit. No. Now you're Don Juan and you know it. Even if it's just some smooching

* **Don't post your sob stories on social media.** Nobody fucking cares about your sad-sack status update on facebook. Nobody wants to be friends with some mopey cry-baby. Express yourself in person to friends. Want to post something on facebook or twitter? Make it awesome. Show people that you're awesome. Fake it til you make it.

* **Enjoy the weight loss.** Your appetite might be screwed because you're so sad. Whatever. Turn it into something good. Throw those weights around and use it to your advantage. Pretend like you're cutting weight for the big fight coming up. You'll look awesome. You'll feel awesome.

* **Grow a beard.** Because fuck you.

* **Don't contact your ex.** Just leave it alone. You know that it's only going to make you feel like crap. You want it to be different. It's not. Just leave them alone. If they want you back*

This is how I'm doing it. There are hard days and there are good days.

I called the local news channel and had a correspondent meet me there. At least it's gotten that far. 

The families have expressed to me that they have absolutely been prevented from visiting the site for over 15 years. They took this all the way to the State Capital and were turned down there as well. They just want to have the remaining bodies exhumed and reburied at a cemetery. 

What can I do legally to help the families? 

UPDATE: I found new info

Oaklynn Cemetery was created in 1929 for use as an African-American burial area. Apparently the other local cemetery was asking too much money for their plots so this was the only other option at the time. Anyway, though there is some speculation as to whether or not anyone was buried in that area at the time. The county has said that there were over 300 plots on the property but only 26 were documented, so there could very well be a lot more graves, we just don't know. The first burial happened in 1929, the final burial (documented) was in 1969. There are 3 Veterans buried there, 2 WWI vets, and a WWII vet. 

I've written an email to the Mayor, despite whether he knows it or not.

UPDATE Mark II: I contacted the Veterans of Foreign Wars today and they were a little more than pissed that 3 of their own were laying in the middle of the woods somewhere.

The game was inspired by Chris Hecker's Spy Party, Greg Trefry (Come Out and Play) and Nick Fortugno (Playmatics)... as well as [these people](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/594084262/pants-by-bluff-works/posts) that [blogged about it](http://derbswords.tumblr.com/post/27371295645/do-as-i-do-and-move-says-i) or [wrote about it](http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/725530/nerdsourcing-trial-of-the-clone-super-retro-squad-do-say-move/) purely in support of the project (in other words, I have no idea who they are but love that they support me). 

* There's a $5 Print and Play option and the full game with all mods is $25 (which includes shipping and handling anywhere in the US). $5 extra bucks gets you shipping across the entire planet.
* The game is production ready and we'll have the files to a printer on Wednesday (if this goes through) so we can have high-quality plastic-coated cards, so they must be durable, strong and resistant to sweaty palms.
* I've been testing this for over a year and a half with hundreds of players

So all I ask is for you to check out the [project](http://www.domovesay.com) and pledge if you're interested. If you're not interested, a camp director, a LARPer...

Thanks so much.

I never realized how much money was just disappearing every month and going straight to credit cards.

The difference is shocking. and my spending habits aren't even that different. I was basically responsible but just carrying the anchor of dept from when I wasn't responsible in my youth. I guess you just get used to it.

But today I remembered why. I haven't heard from this girl for about 5 hours (and still haven't) and started to get progressively more concerned. I sent a phone, and was getting progressively more paranoid about what she might be doing and if it meant she would reject me. I started wondering if she was on a date with someone else and I pulled up her match.com profile to see when she had last logged in. I started to have a physical reaction as well. That is when it clicked that something was off.

So I started clicking through wikipedia and looked at ""codependency"" (not sure if it is quite that) and specifically the ""low self-esteem [patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codependency#Patterns_and_characteristics)"".  

It isn't the first time I've realized that i have a self-esteem problem, and definitely have difficulty setting priorities even when I intellectually know that I am making a mistake. 

This is when I had that moment of clarity and realized that I was allowing my own ""esteem"" to depend on outside factors. I was (am) allowing my achievements, and therefore actions should follow from the person's status as a valuable, lovable person. For example: I would previously think that if I didn't eat right or didn't exercise that would mean I am worse of a person (again, making that the variable). Instead, by assuming you are an amazing person, you should make decisions worthy of such a valuable person. Get it? I *think* I believe it.

1. On a 3 lane one way street. There doesn't happen to be any vehicle traffic at this time. I approach an intersection where I have a green light. A horde of pedestrians decides to cross the street right in front of me, and smile at them politely. None of them seemed to see anything wrong with the situation. Indeed some looked at me as if *I* had done something wrong.

2. 45 seconds later on that same street. Right lane is full of parked cars. Middle lane has two illegally double-parked vans in it directly in front of me. Left lane has lots of high speed vehicle traffic approaching from the rear. There's a sizeable gap between the illegally double parked vans and the parked cars, keeping a close eye out for drivers opening doors and pedestrians sneaking through. As I am just getting past the second double-parked van, a vehicle turning right into a driveway from the left lane at about 25 mph comes within inches of hitting me. I avoid an accident only by swerving wildly onto the sidewalk. I look back-- it's the first double-parked van - the driver swung around the vehicle parked in front of him and made a blind, high-speed right turn directly into me. Then he slammed on the horn and told me to watch where I was going.

3. A few minutes later on a different, stopped at a red light with a right blinker on. I'm going straight, and since I don't want to get hit by that car when it turns right, or any other car turning right, I wait behind it in the center of the right lane. An SUV coming the other direction down the road makes an illegal, middle of the block U turn and tries to fit behind me, but he doesn't have space to make the U turn, motioning me to cut around to the right of the car in front of me. I do my best charade rendition of ""I don't want to get hit when that idiot turns right without looking

Like I said, of which all but around a mile took place in bike lanes. I'm sure everyone who rides in a city has similar stories.

1371494509.0,1gj57q,Two years ago I did an AMA on my chocolate chip cookies – I was inspired by redditors’ feedback and today we’re shipping thousands of pounds a week! Thank you-- here’s an update!,begreen123,342,84,94,"I’m Bart Greenhut

When MY former,) the the Keebler elves pulled a switcheroo and the previously delicious cookies transformed into bland, oversweet, masses of dough. (my opinion) 

I did an AMA in 2011. I'm doing this AMA as an update and so that I can answer any questions you may have about being in business or starting your own company.

So

Lots of redditors’ responded to my story. BUT, upgraded shipping to USPS Priority instead of 3rd Class mail.  ***ALL THESE CHANGES and more, WERE THANKS TO REDDIT feedback and inspiration!***

Through 2011 we continued to perfect our cookies while adding distribution to about 100 more

Normally, in 2011 I felt I needed to postpone until we could get away from the daily chaos. 

So in May

At the time of my original reddit AMA I didn’t seriously considered expanding because I was fearful that the reality would somehow end up crushing my vision.  *** I mean

The feedback I received from redditors’ opened my eyes to new possibilities. 

We knew people loved our cookies, I always factor-in that 12 years earlier, I had survived a rare disease and I was already older than my father was when he died.

MY big question was whether I had it in me to essentially begin a new career at an age when most people were winding down.

My advice to many redditors’ two years ago was to **“march fearlessly into the future

Judy's question to me was; what would I enjoy most? That was easy, for as long as possible!*** That’s when Judy and I decided to go “all-in”.

***“The Best Chocolate Chip Cookies In The World” is much more than a provocative brand name and it’s not hype

We are committed to always be true to our ideals, hands down the best) blended with our favorite American Butter . *Today, I believe that it’s virtually impossible for anybody, to qualitatively surpass our cookies. * Some people think we’re nuts. We know we’re not normal. 

Our business plan isn’t normal either:  ***“Spread happiness, provide only the best to our customers and, never exceed our means.”***

Today, great suppliers, own our own equipment and produce everything in house. Inventory soaks up cash so we bake-to-order, and ship fresh. Much better for cookie-lovers and gives us an important distinction in the marketplace. 

***I believe that the enemy of every idealistic enterprise is needing outside money.*** To most investors, cookie, we went the more arduous route of developing our own better, flour rather than simply employing a common, commercial gluten-free flour.*** Most investors wouldn’t be happy with that.

Personally, you deserve the best and in reality we’ve found that the cost differential between quality and commodity is typically less than 15%! In the future we want to challenge the status quo and sell against Famous Amos and Chips Ahoy.

It strikes me daily how fragile life is and how fortunate we’ve been. So… ***before another moment passes I want to thank all you Redditors for supporting us and our unconventional cookie business. Thank you to everyone who believes in what we stand for and especially to those of you who actually search out our cookies and recommend them to friends

We’ve learned a lot since our last AMA mostly we learned the process of changing the world

Thanks to you all

P.S. If you guys have the interest

Bart

EDIT: Because you guys asked for it

EDIT: 7/1/13 As of today, Get One sale going on right now for our BIG BOX (250 cookies). It's $29.95 for the BIG BOX and you'll get TWO (that's 500 cookies for roughly $30). Just use the code listed and order (bartsbakery.com). THANK YOU, REDDIT!

What I've learned. 

-Deep Freeze. We had Deep Freeze but switched to Clean Slate. Deep Freeze was not playing nice with other programs that we had installed. The head IT dude could explain why this was happening much better then I can. Should we switch back? 

-There are awesome options for handling this. Thank you for the posts and PM's about these. At this point I start to wonder what is the best option

TechSoup, Couldn't you achieve a similar effect by simply setting up a Scheduled task to robocopy from a restore?(wat??), group policies, whitelist, SteadyState and more. Honestly, how do you pick?

The very worst... teaching someone how to use the mouse. Those are the IT problems I deal with. 

I'm a librarian first, or have since played with computers to learn how to deal with something like this.  When shit like this comes up, my automatic response is, ""Fuck... now what do I do."" And my mind goes blank. I get so worried about fucking up the machine, that I don't let myself try things.

I'm not going to worry about being cool for redditkin

How did I handle it today? I unplugged the offending machine from the network, and then I'm leaving it to be ghosted. And with the ghosting, what I did delete, does it even matter? Right?
