I'm not sure if I would describe Burning Man as a religion but it definitely has many of the characteristics of one- a series of core principles, a global community built around a common identity, and shared values.

I'm not religious in any normal sense but I can honestly say that the most ""Spiritual"" experience I've ever had was with my girlfriend in 2008

I'm not suggesting calling Larry Harvey a prophet or any nonsense like that

Doing this would probably give the haters more to rant about but haters gonna hate.  The only thing I'd be worried about is if calling it a religion discouraged people from wanting to attend for the first time.  However

Obviously

Anyways

I'd like to know what people think.  I don't think it's definitely a good idea (it might even be a terrible idea) but I do think it's worth talking about.

edit- I'd like to add that the Jedi thing was more of a joke/atheist statement/fandom movement.  This would be legit.  The Jedi thing just provided the idea to list being a Burner.

edit2- There's a percentage of people downvoting (obviously expected, please share!

1313178271.0,jh2gd,Burning Man tips for shy people- it's easier than you think. But still terrifying sometimes.,brodyqat,78,7,35,"Hi.
Are you shy? Do you have a hard time walking into a roomful of complete strangers and striking up a conversation? Does the idea of walking out of your tent in a crazy outfit strike terror into your heart? Cool

The dumbest mistake I made my virgin year was expecting the playa to entertain me. Expecting other people to reach out to me and draw me in. I was intensely shy

Burning Man isn't a spectator place, but they're still people. If you are desperately shy and walking around hoping someone will talk to you-- it might happen, it might not. But if you make an effort to talk to OTHER people, the results will be good. If you don't make an effort, you might be disappointed. And lonely. 

Here are some suggestions that have worked well for me. I've managed over 7 years at Burning Man to transform myself from a desperately shy person into someone who is less-shy and can easily talk to others. Most of the time. 

* Smile. Seriously. Shy people are sometimes seen as angry/aloof/haughty/unfriendly. Fake it until you make it

* if you bring costumes to burning Man but then feel weird going out in them because you think people might look at you funny or judge you, in fact people enjoy complimenting each other on costumes if they notice you at all. It's a good conversation starter. But no matter what, people are too busy thinking about themselves to think about judging you or whatever. You might FEEL terrifyingly like the center of attention when you step out of your tent in something that pushes your comfort zone, but you look pretty normal to everyone else. NOTHING is normal in BRC, so the weird becomes the norm. 

* Have some conversational starters. Not ""lines""

* Try an experiment where you let the whims of others dictate your day. Walk up to strangers and say that you're doing this and ask them for a destination suggestion or an activity. When they say something like ""go climb the Man base and check it out"" or ""go visit XYZ camp and do (activity)""

* Go to an activity you find in the What Where When guide. You'll meet people there because you'll all be doing the same thing. It provides context

* Meet your neighbors in the next camps over. Bring a snack or a drink or just a smile. Ask where they're from, and often a seat in their shade and a beer and an invite to sit around and shoot the shit for a while. 

* Go to the Volunteer table near Playa Info in center camp, and a pilot gave me a ride in his plane afterward. Having a Job makes it easy not to be shy. 

* if all else fails and you feel desperate yet brave, shit, we're all shy sometimes.

Here's the deal. I have an extra ticket to Burning Man, there's no monetary value associated with it.


I don't have a lot of time to volunteer this year


There are no strings attached to this gift


PLEASE NOTE: I also value following instructions, but full sentences, proper grammar and the like will lead to a more-positive response from me.


Here's how to submit yourself for consideration:

* send an email to oneburningticket@gmail.com with the subject line ""Burning Man Gift Ticket Request"".

* in the body of the email


1) Have you been to Burning Man before? If so, and the event is soon.


2) Why should I choose you? What participation will you bring to the playa? Any plans for making art or other interactivity?


3) What city do you live in?


4) Anything else you'd like to mention?


CONSIDERATIONS:

* I will choose a ticket recipient on August 4th

* You will receive one gift ticket to Burning Man (either by mail, this would be nice but not necessary, come visit me on the playa and give me a hug and tell me how your Burn is going. I am not creepy and I am a girl. I will not grope you.


Have a nice day!

The long answer is that during the winter and spring, and little ground absorption because of an icy water table.

But under current summer conditions the water will be gone in a couple of days and the playa will be perfectly resurfaced by next week. In that way this is a really good thing for playa conditions. Except where people are walking and driving and working on the wet playa.

Where people are agitating the wet playa there will be rough

**EDIT**: I think the original author is [""Jaygo Ishkabibble of Disorient""](http://www.reddit.com/user/wugmump).

(From what my *friends* have told me-- of course), 3, 4, and 9 require particular attention in order to avoid potential disappointment out there.

1) don't assume you're going to get laid.

2) don't assume the drugs will be great.

3) don't assume you're going to be able to find drugs.

4) people will do drugs and get laid. if you can't deal don't go.

5) you will have a serious knock down drag out fight with whomever you go with. if your relationship can't handle it

6) assume you will have a massive breakdown out there. if the person with whom you are going can't handle taking care of you

7) don't fuck with other people's burn. people enjoy the event in different ways

8) it's better to come overprepared than to underprepare.

9) sad but true: cute chicks have a better time. make sure you have at least one in your group

10) any art you bring

11) any tech art you bring will break. every tech you bring will break

12) the dust is so much less oppressive than you think it will be.

13) you really need to bring something to hide yourself from the elements when there is a dust storm.

14) it's the noisiest place on earth. bring earplugs. and if your neighbor is banging techno at 5AM

15) the beginning of the week is better than burn night.

16) burn night is one of the weirdest nights you'll ever experience.

17) don't fuck with the art car crews. they will cut choo.

18) make sure you bring nice things for the art car crews; befriending an art car makes the event a vastly better experience.

19) gifts are good things.

20) cheap crappy gifts that people will have to carry around for a while before they throw away are a total waste of time. a cold can of beer is better than a million crappy glowsticks.

21) make sure you are sufficiently lit for night.

22) make sure you are prepared for a full range of weather; be ready for 120 degrees during the day and freezing cold at night.

23) and make sure that the clothing you bring has lots of pockets and can handle the dust.

24) feel free to ignore all of this and come with an open mind. the event is simultaneously a frightening cliché and the best thing in the world. plan accordingly.

25) have fun!

And this **scares** me; it's covered pretty much EVERYWHERE.

Do you also know that there are no food vendors in BRC?  You have to bring in food for yourself for an entire week.  Do you realize how much food that is?  How are you going to keep it cold?

And that you have to bring ~1.5gallons per person per day with you?  

And that there are white outs right now?  

And that it's hot?  Like really hot?

And that at night it's cold?  Like really cold?

And that there are exactly 0 amenities there for you?  

And that you need some sort of shade structure to live under?  

And that you also need to light yourself so you don't get run over by a fucking car?

And do you realize that you need to stake your shit down?

[This](http://www.scouttech.com/ProdImages/abs_tent_stakes.jpg)  is not a tent stake.

No, and made of rebar or concrete forming stakes, and if you hit somebody with it, it would kill them because it weighs 10 lbs.

Ice: when you put ice in your cooler, you can use the water from when it melts for washing, shower, or whatever. 

Cooler: You may have a great 5-day cooler. Want to make it extra effective? Get some of [this](http://www.acehardwareoutlet.com/ProductDetails.aspx?SKU=54113).  Measure and cut off a piece for the bottom of your cooler and the underside of the lid. It makes a difference!

By using the above 2 methods

Use a camelbak or other hydration pack as a ""Playa Pack"". Make sure it has a few pockets. Put things in there like:

lip balm, clif bar, sanitizer, small first aid kit with bandages and neosporin, lighter, sunblock, bandanna, small pad of paper and a pen (to get contact info for those awesome people you meet!). All this stuff is small and lightweight and useful! When you get back to your camp

Pack a couple sets of clean clothes in freezer bags and leave them in your car. When you get to that hotel and shower and are able to put on dust-free clothes

Bring a couple of throwaway sheets and wrap them over your car seats. When you leave

Coconut juice! Get some

Bring real food, okay, but don't make them your mainstay. By day 2 or 3 you will be dying for real food!! Just cook some things up during the week prior, portion them into ziplocs, freeze, and put in cooler. Take one out in the morning and put it on the dash of your vehicle on top of a piece of foil. It should be nice and warm by the time you get to it later that day! Alternately, just bring a camp stove and boil in bag to reheat!

Bring a large sheet and cover your bed with it every day. That way you can at least get a couple of nights of relatively dust-free sleeping! It's far better than not doing so!

1346784141.0,zcjzm,Things I liked about 2012.,inkplay,47,3,57,"Getting down the thoughts of things I liked. This was my 5th year and I'm gonna call it as my 2nd favorite so far (2010 was the other.)
Here are my notes!

I liked the smaller turnout. Last year the playa seemed so packed at night with art cars, and enjoy the trip, and take time to connect with individuals, instead of just being part of a big crowd. 

There was a lot of art. The core effigy number seemed to have doubled and they were fun and huge and fantastic. I think the core burn is great idea

I liked the weather- In hindsight. A whiteout is no fun when you're being battered in the face, inside a ridiculous piece of art, sharing water and holding on to each other is unique, and I appreciate unique times. It forced us to change our plans and kept me out of familiar ruts.  Also, it never got too cold.    

I Really liked all the newcomers. I found them informed and all-in. I thought the crowd skewed a little younger this year, the party was Not Stopping. There was a touch of that ""Spring Break"" vibe, lots of college-age shirtless dudes with abs misting tutu-d co-eds at Distrikt, but for me it never got annoying. Everyone was having a blast and seemed to be able to Handle their Shit. Right on. I welcome next year's batch of Sophomores and can't wait to see what this year's inspiration makes them bring to next year. 

The music was very good this year. House House. Deep, Indie. SOLID. Dubstep was minimal, only on art-cars and a few camps. But Damn. Dat House. Opulent delivered and Roots was crazy. Smaller Camps like Want It and the Terminal also delivered killer vibes. The big-sound-art-cars knew what was up. Thank you to everyone who brought tunes. 

BURN NIGHT. WOW.
I haven't gotten this close to the man since my first year. I usually watch it from atop a cozy scaffolding in the distance. I'm so glad I came down this year. The  burn was huge. The human energy was explosive. Then the entire esplanade turned into a dance floor with hundreds of art-car DJ's. Unforgettable. 

For reference

These are just my positive opinions. What did you really like?

(*Reposted

Greetings from the DPW Sign Shop! We're the crew that creates all the
city signage you see! From the ""Burma Shave"" signs' quips and quotes
(courtesy of Larry) to ""No driving on the playa
production in mid-July and start putting them up as soon as the
perimeter fence is in. The signs are OUR art and the largest
installation on the playa!

It seems that every year
Aside from people needing these signs to find their way home
CRUCIAL to our EMT staff. They use them to call for emergency medical
assistance. Imagine if you called 911 and had to tell them ""I'm by the
blinkie thing!"" We don't want anyone's wait for treatment delayed. We
create the signs to be souvenirs so stealing them isn't the problem; it's
WHEN you steal them! So PLEASE leave the signs up until the city is
disappearing!

As for ""alteration"" of signs
sign posts rather than covering up what's already there. ADDING signs
is far more creative than defacing someone else's art! And again
covering up signs could thwart our EMTs.
We'd like to ask YOU to become a ""steward"" of your closest street
signs. OWN that intersection signage! Guard it! And then take it home
with you on Monday!

MUCH LOVE from the DPW Sign Shop

I've been at my job for nearly 4 years.  There is a lot of job security in the type of work that I do

Yesterday, as it has, but that's neither here nor there.  I was feeling very trapped in my position, trapped by my own level of comfort and false sense of security.

I saw and read the post about decompression tips.  The one thing that stood out most to me was the length of time suggested to wait before making any life changing decisions.  3 weeks.  Guess how long it takes to form a new habit?  About 3 weeks.  So essentially, so I'm reduced to another brain-washed, comfortably miserable drone before making any life-changing decisions?  But I'll be complacent and trapped!

My decompression process has been unbelievably hard this year.  I've found myself feeling completely alienated and alone, and even though I'll be making less money, I know I will be infinitely more fulfilled at the end of each day.

My job was my parakeet.  I divorced my parakeet.

And you know what?  I couldn't be happier.

(For those of you new around here- I think Urban Dictionary's definition of [Shirtcocked](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shirtcocked) is a pretty good summary of it

If I had a shirtcocking resume

* I've been shirtcocking 4 years now

* I've done my best to one-up myself each year.

* Playa names have included ShirtCocker and Thelonious Barebottom.

Like all super heroes, communication and psych for the playa), and had been working (either in uniform or with a uniform in my camelbak and on-call) for about 4 days straight. Hadn't had tons to do, but was representing the department- had to be sober and professional. My boss is pretty big on cultural competence AND professionalism. The burn is one place you can't possibly do both at the same time, and the stress of it got to me. The first morning I got up and didn't have to work, I figured I'd have to do THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL thing I could think of- which turned out to be shirtcocking. I didn't plan it that way, but I happened to step out of my trailer about 5 minutes before the managers' meeting started

Anyhow, but successive years involved a strap-on, stilts, taller stilts, stilts and a strap on, etc... 

Also, so they can participate- and I think that's where the glory of shirtcocking comes in. Shirtcocking is combining two totally-accepted clothing choices (clothed and naked), in the one way you're not allowed. It's as if the color green was banned- blue and yellow are ok, but to mix them? Oh, god! It pushes peoples' buttons for no reason, and I love that. There's something wonderful about it. 


As for questions- 

**Why not just go naked?** I think I've answered that one. 

**How does it feel being one of the most oppressed minorities in a subculture that espouses radical inclusion?**  IT'S FUCKING AWESOME! When my existence gets that much of a reaction

**What kind of abuse have you received?** Most people actually receive it pretty well. I don't get a lot of hugs on Hug a Shirtcocker Day, I offered one guy a hug, and he looked like I had just pulled the flag of of his WWI-surviving great-grandfather and used it to wipe my ass on Memorial Day. It was FANTASTIC!

**What are your favourite pantless outfits?** Stilts

**What did it feel like the first time?** It was great! People were soooo weirded out. I accidentally trolled the entire managers' meeting for ESD- approximately 30 of my supervisors and such!

**Did you practise at home in front of the mirror?** Nope! It just happened- but that's a pretty funny thought. 

**Uhh...maybe they're just slightly insecure and shirtcocking is a way that they can ease themselves into full nudity?** Nope. I also run around nude when I don't feel like putting on clothes. 

**Isn't the hate for shirtcockers kindof a joke anyway?** For most people

“The only point I personally see in shirtcocking is ""LOOK AT MY PENIS, that gives me an idea- I think I'm going to do some androgi-cocking this coming year- a T-shirt and flesh-colored spandex underwear. I think it might be even more strange than shirtcocking!)

Other questions? Hit me up!

I am a virgin burner with quadriplegia and I rely heavily on using an electric wheelchair to take me where I need to go.  The battery drives about 8 miles per charge.  I could also bring a manual wheelchair

I was wondering if there might be places for me to charge my wheelchair every night?

I plan on driving my van.

Do any of you have any experience with this kind of situation? Any help would be truly appreciated.

1376616492.0,1kgjq2,Car tips: Keeping your fluids cool and your car alive.,drive2fast,39,0,17,"Your car was not built with the harsh drive to the Playa in mind. Be gentle with it on the trip. Read below for a few tips and tricks. IAMA a 7x burner and ASE Master Mechanic/Canadian Red seal Mechanic.

Tranny: No
Do you own an automatic transmission. Yes? You NEED an auxiliary transmission cooler. Pretty much every car out there has barely enough transmission cooling for around town use. Load up that car beyond it's recommended GVW, you transmission oil life can absolutely fall off a cliff.

Automatic transmission fluid (ATF) lifespan: At 195F, at 235F, that drops to 12,500 miles. 295F, 1500 miles. 375F, 80 MILES!! Buy an aux. cooler and you will extend the life of your transmission+oil and have fewer transmission oil changes over the life of your car. Trust me, it's cheaper over time. Synthetic engine or transmission oils tolerates a whole lot more heat and performs far better under harsh conditions.

If synthetic oil is compatible with your car's gearbox (research this on google or ask the dealer), as 70% of your oil is trapped in the torque converter. Look for a shop that has a flush machine that connects to the oil cooler hoses and exchanges about 12L out of your transmission. VW's are out of luck and use a water cooling system.

If you have a manual, get that factory oil. It's worth it. Cooling is not an issue.

Engine oil: First off, but engines running in extreme heat often benefit from a slightly thicker grade of oil. Same goes for higher mileage engines. Read your car owner's manual for info. If you have more than 150,000 miles on your car, chances are it is smarter to bump up one grade of oil anyways. If you use 5w30, consider 10w40, especially if your car normally lives in a warmer climate. In winter it may be too thick. Don't put your old, ancient motor on synthetic as oil leaks can occor. It's been happy on dino juice

Don't ever, you can stretch out intervals a little with synthetic.

Personally, it's a little secret to machines lasting forever. No one properly tests against buildup of everyone else's additives. In a pinch, the wrong lube is better than no lube, so use your brain.

Coolant: Is your coolant kinda murky? It's too late to change it. Do a last minute flush and you will clean all that dirt out that was holding your cooling system together. If anything is sub par

DO NOT use bars leak or any other leak stopper that is a thick goo or aluminum flakes. You will plug up an already crappy cooling system. I personally use a water pump lubricant and minor leak sealer made by 'kleen-flo' that is a thin liquid and seals tiny pinholes only.

Your cars coolant will turn acidic after 2-5 years depending on the car and eat your head gaskets

If your car gets warm, pull over before it hits the red, pop your hood and KEEP THE CAR RUNNING unless you are puking out coolant. Stop the cooling system and the temperature really spikes up. If you are off the end of the gauge, shut it down and wait awhile. A 30 min wait can save a $4000 motor.

Is your car running hot while overloaded

Don't forget you may have a differential and a transfer case in there too. Don't change dark (but not black) brake fluid before a trip. Again

Read your service manuals and the recommended maintenance intervals from your dealer (important!) for when to change all your fluids and the recommended intervals. I will tell you that current transmission oil change intervals got larger with no engineering changes from the manufacturers. They just decided to increase the intervals to make cars 'less maintenance intensive'. I drop 4L out of my transmission every 25

When you get your dealer recommended maintenance guide (free at every dealer)

Finally, pay for the extra under car rust protection/wax at the car wash. I pressure wash out my engine compartment and clean the crap out of everything when I get back. Playa dust is corrosive and is hard on things.

Do I need to find friends to go with or network before going for safety/security reasons? I'm perfectly content hanging out with myself and making friends as I go

Is there cell phone reception at all in the area (specifically Verizon)? I'm assuming not

We finished loading and began rolling towards 9:00, ready for a good Tuesday. My kid was carrying a 1000 candlewatt flashlight. He hopped up on the front of the art car (it has a built out bumper) at the Tokyo post office. He was helping direct traffic around us- we could barely move. One short distance later, we were passing the med station at 9:00, where a host of Pershing Sheriff's were standing. 

About this time I told him to get down, that nakedness was for adults, etc. 

We waited for about 2 hours while they ran our backgrounds, etc. They implied that if we were clean we'd get some sort of warning.

Then they arrested me for child endangerment, after the boy got his stuff. He was taken to a CPS room at 3:00 med station where he waited for his stepdad to come from California to get him - about 11am the next morning. 


I spend the night in Lovelock and paid $885 to a bail bondsman on a $5600 bond, and I rode back. I had credentials rather than a ticket so re-entry was no problem. I filed reports with LEAL and ACLU, slept the night. On Wednesday, I saw some people, and after dark I drove to California to pick up my son. Drove home. No burn for either of us.

I registered for tickets on the advice of a friend and got two. One for me, registering couldn't hurt (I have a feeling this happened A LOT). The only reason I'm actually in a position to go is I'm quitting my fancy corporate job around that time.  


       
The truth:  

Initially, except that I could afford the tickets. In the last week I have come to learn quite a bit, about the history, the composition of the event, the principles and the ethos. Even still, I was planning on being a 'tourist', checking it out and moving on with my life.

Then I figured I should hear from some vets, but delete my account every few months in a fit of self loathing about the wasted time).


So after reading about the phenomenal cluster fuck that is the ticketing process, I don't feel bad enough to dump my tickets into STEP (corporate training and whatnot)


So, but then if I do that, some group might not have had the time to plan or whatever.


I'm a mid 20's able bodied male that's handy with a hammer and can afford to contribute. Open to any advice.

1313742985.0,jnoz3,FYI Active SCAMMERS in San Francisco - Details to watch out for!,bumati,38,0,4,"
Within the past week I have personally met up with BM ticket scammers in downtown San Francisco, one average-size guy in his early 20s, and another fatass who looked a few years older. Fatty had a huge wad of cash in his pocket and was obviously the man behind the curtain. The palms of his hands were rather pale for a black dude. The smaller guy was the one who posted tickets on Craigslist so he did most of the talking. His alias was ""Aaron"". 

Long story short I didn't trust the deal so I didn't buy

1. Overall print quality is decent but still way grainy compared to the highly detailed print of a legit ticket. Colors are also not saturated enough. 

2. The paper it was printed on is nearly twice as thick as a real ticket. The surface is a bit glossier and sticks to your finger a little. Real ticket has a fine smooth matte surface. 

3. The shiny holographic regions have incorrect patterns (although the one on back side is quite similar)

4. Font used for ""Burning Man Black Rock City ...etc"" at the top and bottom holographic portions of the back side is totally incorrect. Real font is a square-ish design. The fine print covering the middle is just reproduced from a scan

5. The embossed circular seal has fake 3D details; it's a printed illusion. There is an overall circular impression which makes it seem embossed

6. The barcodes either have difficulty scanning, they are obviously clones of each other! Every real ticket has a unique code. 

These scammers are moving around SF; they might conduct the sale anywhere between Sunset and Downtown. Some others have posted on Craigslist saying they were ripped off by the same guys. Those victims may not have known what to look for

I walked away with vital knowledge but of course without the tickets I needed. I hope that by sharing this knowledge with all of you

1.  Burning Man barely sold out last year.  There are 10, who are realizing that they aren't ready to spend a week out in the desert.  Know in advance there isn't much demand.

2.  Post pertinent information.  Will call or paper.  If paper

3.  What kind of ticket it was.  Camp ticket, ect.  If it is STEP, you can't transfer it, so don't bother trying.  Low income tickets aren't transferable either.

4.  You aren't going to sell at cost unless you find a really altruistic buyer

5.  One option is to take your chances and sell a ticket on the road.  I saw three people begging for tickets last year

Buyers:

1.  Confirm that the ticket is valid.  Here is the [list of voided tickets](http://tickets2.burningman.com/info.php?i=3815).

2.  Here is the [will call name change form](https://secure.inticketing.com/namechange.php?nug=burn).

3.  Use paypal if at all possible.  You can get a refund if you get scammed (and please post details about the scammer, so we can ban them).

4.  Get your ass packing.

(It's important to remember that swamp coolers aren't magical panaceas - there are plenty of other things to consider like the volume of air you're trying to cool, etc. - but if you've nailed all of these things, you can bring the temp. inside your tent down to a much more manageable 75-80 degrees F during the middle of the day!)

So what should you go and do/see once you get out there? I have some suggestions of things that you shouldn't miss


    




-Wear your finest, and will teach you one of their secret handshakes if your attire is elaborate enough. 

    
-There is a camp where everyone wears red jumpsuits. I think they're called 'The Humane Society' or something like that. If you see someone walking around in the playa with a red jumpsuit


    
-There is one camp that does a really soothing evening meditation session called The Thunderdome (though as an ironic anti-consumerist statement they refer to their camp as 'Hot Topic'). Be sure to seek out this camp. They give great one-on-one spiritual healing sessions-- just walk into their big geodesic dome and tell one of the camp members you'd like to participate in the ritual. Incredibly relaxing.

    

I'll add more tips as they come to me... How about you guys? Any other vets with some good protips for noobies?


    


*Kamakiri has reminded me about the amazing bacon quiche served at center camp
    

*Also there are several caches of premium beer placed in coolers and buried just below the surface along the trash fence. I don't know who buries them (certainly not the DPW)

* Bring a minimum of 2 pairs of contacts for each day you'll spend on playa. I have about a 70% success rate (ie. I end up tossing about 30% of the contacts I attempt to put in)
* Goes without saying
* **Never** touch the inside of your contacts with any part of your skin. I don't care how much you think you've washed your hands - they're still too dirty. Even brushing the inside while cleaning or unfolding your contact will probably ruin it. [Here's a handy guide](http://i.imgur.com/f05TpSI.jpg).

Every year is not like this.  There are 12 hour dust storms with 60mph winds. There are below freezing nights or night time dust storms where you literally cannot see your hand in front of your face even with a head lamp.

My name is Johnny. 2013 will be my first Burn, for about 6 years. She absolutely loved it. It was amazing, as a teenage boy growing up, watching Sarah get ready for her trip every year. She went every year until 2001, when she was taken from us, as she worked in the south tower of the World Trade Center, and never made it out alive after the attacks. I was 16 when she died.

Ever since then, was my hero. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about her. I want to honor her by going this year, and sit in the Temple and tell her that I finally made it.

Here's where you guys come in- my intentions are good behind going, and above all, I'm a really shy dude. Really shy. I always have trouble talking to people I don't know. By all means, Burning Man will be shoving me outside of my comfort zone. But, I know Sarah would have wanted me to go and experience it, and I can't wait. 

So, and that scares me. What can I do to mentally prepare? How can I become brave enough to jump in?

Thanks so much guys- I can't wait to see you on the Playa

All the best

1342459153.0,wnhoi,Make your cooler into a tiny seven day refrigerator. ,,36,5,35,"Hi there

Keeping things cool is all about efficient insulation

You need:

* ~10lbs Block water ice for each cooler you pack in this way

* ~3-4lbs Dry Ice for each cooler

* cardboard 

* reflectix bubble pack insulation (enough to line the inside of your cooler)

* tape

* a thermometer if you're really anal about knowing what temp your food is at.

* A pallet or a couple planks to set your cooler on

* Some shade at burning man

***

Do all this right before you're ready to go and you have all the food you'd want to pack up. 

**Step 1:** Get your shiny bubble wrap and cut pieces to line the inside of your cooler, stick that on with your double sided tape or rolled duct tape. This creates a bit of radiant barrier for your cooler, and adds an extra layer of insulation too. 

**Step 2:** Layer up your dry ice on the bottom, but you don't want your dry ice coming in contact with your food. The water ice will insulate your dry ice to keep it from sublimating too quickly. 

You can just take your blocks of ice and stick them in your cooler or you can use ice forms and smaller chunks of ice to get a tighter fit. If you use cube ice

You need about 3-4 inches of water ice between your dry ice and your food to avoid it freezing solid. But you can also leave a little gap in your your block ice layer to slip a carton if ice cream into for later. Your camp mates will probably think you're some sort of wizard if you can produce ice cream in the middle of the week from a hidden compartment. 

**Step 3:** Don't stick your food in yet

**Step 4:** Go to burning man. 

**Step 5:** Once you get there

*""2011 provided two compelling reasons to change how tickets are sold: a challenging ticket launch day, we got busy with a deep examination of our processes and technology - and of new ideas, some of them straight from your feedback - to figure out how to provide successful, smooth ticket sales in 2012.*

*The big news: tickets to **Burning Man 2012 will be offered via a lottery system.** This solution offers a two-fold benefit: it eliminates the annual ticket sales rush by spreading out registration over time (no more sitting in ""line"" all day

*We'll have more details coming very soon (including deadlines and prices) but here's a summary of the major changes to how tickets will be obtained:*

- You'll first register for the ticket lottery during a 2-week open registration period. At that time
- After the registration period, and you'll receive a ticket confirmation.
- There will be several consecutive lottery rounds.
- You will only be able to purchase tickets from one lottery
- Yhere will be a limited number of tickets per person
- Ticket fulfillment will be held until early summer.

*And YOU, we will be announcing full details, pricing tiers, dates of the registration period and lottery round announcements, and of course a big fat FAQ.*

*PRE-SALES: We also announce the return of a limited Pre-Sale

*REDUCED PRICE PROGRAMS: We continue to welcome and support attendance for lower-income participants, since we're also increasing the number of these tickets that will be available.*

1312172661.0,j5dom,Anxious first-timers: relax,mudclub,32,2,79,"For those of you who are heading out for your first burn and are starting to stress out about packing and preparation: relax.  Everything works out on the playa.  Except for the occasional fall-through at Thunderdome.

- Take a tent.  Non-mesh is generally best.  Your tent is your place of solace from the blowing dust, and if you really need to shake out the dust, you can unstake it, pick it up, and dump it out.

- Take food.  Don't get crazy grand ideas about cooking elaborate meals out there unless you're part of a reasonably large camp with a kitchen and plans for communal dinners.  I pretty much live on off-brand spaghetti-os and the like, granola, crackers, and so on are great.    Don't take anything that needs to be refrigerated.  And somewhere on the playa, someone is giving out bacon.  At all times.  

- Take water.  Lots of it.  I shoot for about 1.5gallons/day, and be sure to carry water with you when you leave camp.

- Shade + seating: Shade's a great idea.  The sun is pretty relentless out there.  Unfortunately, take over a bottle of booze, and hang out with them during the day.  Camp chairs are great, comfortable additions to life in camp.  Even better if they have cupholders.

- Showers: Don't bother.  They're a pain in the ass

- Trash:  Take several empty 5-gallon buckets (from the hardware store, they're hella useful for packing out your greywater.

- Lights - you don't need much in the way of flashlights, obviously illuminated from all sides at night. Art cars and people on bikes - it turns out it hurts a lot when they run over you.
EL Wire, but the disposable nature of glow sticks and ropes makes them a little suboptimal out there.

- Bicycles are a real nice to have out there.  A beater, you don't even need brakes.  Don't take your daily rider.  Any bike you take out there will never be the same when it comes back.

Remember: You're going to be surrounded by 50, give a shit about you.  You will be taken care of.

I've had a pretty extensive list of resources and information for Burning Man for a few years now so I thought I would share with you.  Please feel free to share your thoughts and links as well!!! The more the merrier. :)

Oh


**Costumes -**
Costumes are typically the first thing people think about when they think about Burning Man.  The best way to think about it it is sexy/funky over ""costumes"".  Creativity is king and that can mean many things from taking something from your ""every day"" closet that you won't wear again and gluing/sewing fur or funky fabric onto it
 
Another key component to costumes at BM is accessorizing: jewelry, pasties, scarfs, gloves, wigs, etc are great ways to take a good BM outfit and make it GREAT!  Sometimes simplicity is good but BM is bigger than life so more can certainly be better in most circumstances.
 
In a typical day it is not uncommon to wear 2-3 outfits per day: you will have your around-camp clothes
 
Many people forget about night costumes. It can get brutally cold at night with temperatures down into the 30's at where ski gloves and fur coats are worn for survival.  Having at least one option for pants is a good idea and bringing a fitted long sleeve shirt or other layering pieces are not only easy to pack but they can come in really handy
 
Don't forget you may need a few pairs of pasties!!  www.pastease.com is one of the best sites for pasties.

Where to start with costumes - look at pictures of past BM years.  Go to the BM website and look at the photo gallery sorted by ""people""  you will see endless ideas of costumes.
     
Don't be afraid to try and make your own costumes - a little fur and fabric glue can make the hottest and most versatile BM costume.  Under the Supplies section there is a link for a fabric store that has decent prices on faux fur - hartsfabric.  Keep in mind that making costumes with faux fur can be time consuming (and a little messy) but really worth the hassle when you get out to the playa and slip it on.

Another tip I have for outfits is that I figure out each outfit in DETAIL prior to the trip to burning man. I write on a piece of paper every single thing that goes on that costume (purple shiny shorts, etc), then take the entire thing and put it in a gallon zip lock baggie. I also name each outfit something stupid mainly bc it helps jog my memory later which ones I was particularly fond of based on the name.  Plus, if two outfits share the same part, it makes it easier to label on the list (ie, ""purple shiny shorts from *Purple Nurple Flower Power*""). Not only does bagging your outfits keep them dust-free until it is time to wear them, but your tent is going to be **fucking HOT** during the day and you are going to want to spend as little time as possible in there. Meaning you will not want to spend time picking out your outfits.

**NOTE: MOST OF THESE SITES ARE NSFW**

**Getting to the playa -**
Plan on traffic getting onto the playa.  It's only 110 miles from Reno but getting onto the playa may take you anywhere from 2 hrs to 6 hrs depending on the traffic and your vehicle (RV's will travel much more slowly than an SUV).
 
We typically don't like to stop on the way to the playa but if you're up for it get a road-side taco! YUM.  Some people prefer to get gas in Gerlach
 
If you are a first timer to BM you will go through the Virgin Process
 
**Setting up your camp -**
Whether you are part of a small camp or a large organized camp there are things you will want to keep in mind when setting up your individual part of the camp.  Most people make their way onto the playa as the sun is setting and more often than not you will be setting up your camp in the dark.  If you keep your initial camp set up as flexible as possible the first night you can more easily make adjustments the next morning when you can better assess sun, the way you set up your camp can literally make or break your BM experience. It's worth taking the extra time to set up your camp well the first day.

* Sun - the sun can be brutal in the morning
     
* Shade - definitely plan to bring something (tarp
Another good shade option is something called Aluminet:
http://www.greenhouses-etc.net/equipment/aluminet.htm
     
* Chairs - don't forget to bring something comfortable to sit on.  You will be sitting on a bike for 70% of each day at BM when you get back to camp you want a comfortable place to rest your hump!! Our camp literally bought couches at a thrift store which we store in Reno each year

 -------------------

- Introduction of Harley DuBois (Fairy Godmother of Themecamps). She talks from here on

- This is not a press conference

- Acknowledgement of those virgins in attendance who are bringing a theme camp

- Notice that a blog post

- They have a plan (applause).

- If you aren't up to speed on how we got here

- We are not going to have an open sale. We are taking the 10

- Next group is placed theme camps and mutant vehicles. 10000 tickets will be allotted.

- Surprised by demand.

- Found out with the lottery that they have a lot more people who wanted to come than expected. There is a supply and demand issue.

- Stressing the community as a whole

- Community cannot survive this (*mumble*) you to make this event happen.

- 10

- We are going to be offering some themecamps tickets at the 395 level. One ticket per person. It will be the people needed to make your camp happen.

- Criteria to judge which camps are going to be getting tickets: first of all ten principles, also inclused behind the scenes help to BM and the community), LNT (demonstrate effectiveness in LNT).

- Strategic distribution of your core members. Consider how hard it is to set up

- We hope that tickets will loosen up. People not afraid to say ""hey, and more tickets on the secondary market. No idea how much.

- Theme camps to fill out by March 8th. Know it is a rush. If you make mistakes that's okay. Doesn't have to be perfect

- If you don't get it right now you can go back and fix things later. If you want to be considered for these tickets

- If you know people who are not coming to burning man

- Low income tickets will be after theme camp tickets

- The person filling out the questionnaire needs to be comfortable talking about who gets tickets.

- Don't think there was an widespread issue with scalpers. Mostly just that we have such a great experience that we have too many people trying to get tickets.

- Something about having a global community

- Questions and Answers:

- Q: We are getting a blog post

- Q: Is there any consideration doing it based on early arrivals? A: Yes

- Q: Do you think the demand was artificially high from people getting friends and family to enter, theme camp, a general camper, an expert on gaming systems). Probably more forums too.

- Q: Can you explain a little more about how camps are invited? A: The camps that will be invited have already been selected. We know who we are offering tickets to

- Q: They won't be informed until after...?  A: We will inform them as soon as we get your questionnaire in and we are humanly able to get to it. If you get it in tonight

- Q: Has any consideration been given to unlimited ticketing this year? A: We cannot because of our relationship with the BLM. More importantly, that implies somewhere else. A: We have looked for other places for the last 10 years and haven't found one like this one. Q: Were we ever so much in trouble as this year? A: That's true. Q: Maybe those sites look better now. A: They aren't better now, but maybe there are opportunities we should be exploring. Q None of that would be for this year? A: It's too late, there's not enough time.

- Q: How many theme camps are we expecting. A: I don't know. Q: I thought you said you selected them. A: Oh, in that range? A: That's a safish kind of number. Repeat for the phone: how many theme camps can we expect to benefit from this process, the answer is less than 50%.

- Q: Will you only be accepting (registration) for preapproved themecamps

- Q: (can't hear) A: Yes

- Q: How do performers or presenters get tickets. A: There is a small number we are putting aside for ""other things"" and performers are part of that category. Q: Is that in the questionaire? A: That's separate. That's theme camp only.

- Q: Will it be possible to stagger when people arrive? A: Don't have a perfect answer. Q: (can't hear) A: When you have perfect weather for a temple burn on sunday

- Q: In the short term

- Q: Are the numbers chosen already? A: Yes

- Q: Are villages treated differently than theme camps? Q: Save that question later. Allocations based on percentages of volume of camp.

- Q: Was there some kind of weighting on the general lottery. A: No

- Q: Is the 40% newbie number real? A: My feeling is yes. We won't know until everything is done.

- Q: What's the criteria for core members? A: It's based on early arrival

With nothing (big) to dance to, you think the raver kids who come in for the weekend will care anymore?

What if this is all such a turn off

WE know what awaits us.  They do not.

I have this feeling we are going to see a LOT of tickets return to the fold.  The bad press and negative feelings might have a silver lining.

--------------

From The SFBG : UPDATE (5 PM): LLC board member Marian Goodell just returned my call and said the organization leaders huddled up today to work on solutions to problems raised by the ticket shortfalls. ""We're genuinely really putting our heads together today. We're listening, I get it.""

She recognizes that it's a big problem for established theme camps and art collectives having tickets for only about a third of their members,"" she said. ""That's the part that will hurt us if we don't take another look at this.""

Goodell also acknowledges that it doesn't appear there are as many tickets available within those established burner networks as she had hoped would be the case: ""I doesn't look like camps are sitting on a lot of tickets."" But she also said that she doesn't think the lion's share went to scalpers. ""We don't think there are 10

But Goodell said it was too late to re-do this week's lottery -- ""not possible, an option that would raise other problems.

""We have many different challenges: scalping,"" Goodell said, reiterating her concern that increasing the population would make logistical problems like the long exodus wait even worse. But whether that's even a possibility will depend on the Environmental Impact Statement that is expected to be completed in March.

This year

With the exception of the first weekend after Burning Man

That first weekend was spent unpacking, we could roll out immediately, needing only food, water, and a dozen or so AA/AAA batteries.  Lights, ropes, tents, rebar, etc are all stowed

We're going playatech-mad this time around.  To date

2x [Love seat](http://www.playatech.com/index.php?deptName=04Radical%20Seating&amp;prodDesc=01Playa%20Love%20Seat) - surprisingly stable and robust!  We've modified one into the [Anniveraire chair](http://www.playatech.com/index.php?deptName=04Radical%20Seating&amp;prodDesc=02Anniversaire%20Chair)

1x [Plantry](http://www.playatech.com/index.php?deptName=03Bare%20Necessities&amp;prodDesc=06Plantry) - Not sure we'd do this one again; we've unconvinced of its utility now that it's up.

1x [Bike jack](http://www.playatech.com/index.php?deptName=07Desert%20Delights&amp;prodDesc=03Bike%20Jack)

1x [Black Rock Bar](http://www.playatech.com/index.php?deptName=05Rapid%20Entertainment&amp;prodDesc=01Black%20Rock%20Bar) - this thing is *amazing*.  It's *rock* solid and has TONS of interior storage.  

1x [Gear Gizmo](http://www.playatech.com/index.php?deptName=03Bare%20Necessities&amp;prodDesc=09Gear%20Gizmo) - more robust and stable than it looks!

1x [Teensy table](http://www.playatech.com/index.php?deptName=03Bare%20Necessities&amp;prodDesc=04Teensy%20Table) - in fact 3 tables from one sheet of plywood.

That's about all we're going to manage before the rains set in.

The total materials cost for all of that is (@ $20 per 1/2"" and $30 per 3/4"" sheet) about $180 + a $5/sheet donation to the Black Rock Arts Foundation.

For anyone thinking of making any playatech furniture, many times over.

That leads to the more indoorsy crafts:

One of our virgins is a professional seamstress and clothing designer; she made us amazing custom [vests](http://i.imgur.com/uvnLP.jpg) and skirts/blankets.  Now that she's been convinced that coming with us is the **best idea ever**

Another prospective campmate - non-virgin - is working on digital interfaces to some vehicles which we're in the process of mutating; a golf cart and somewhere between 2 and 5 motorized wheelchairs.  I'll be getting a better idea of where we stand with all of that once the rains kick in and the carpentry goes by the wayside.

1376506289.0,1kd6d7,Quick article regarding alkaline playa,betaboxx,28,3,16,"**Abstract**: The black Rock Desert, is held around labor day when approximately 50, flesh

**Methods**: Playa was collected from sweeping out a mutant vehicle and tent that has been used for multiple burns.  11.5g of collected playa was suspended in a 250mL beaker with 100mL of 18.2 megaohm•cm MilliQ water.  The suspension was stirred vigorously for 10 minutes with a stir plate at 23C.  Four 50µL aliquots of 6M HCl were added to the stirred brown suspension after the initial pH reading of 9.17 was taken.  After adding 200µL of 6M HCl

**Discussion**:  The main problem I have with people using vinegar to neutralize playa is that the pKa of acetic acid is 4.76, thus why topical ointments and cleaners often site a '""pH balanced formula."" 

Due to time limitations and fear of other people asking what I was doing, the majority of the material did not dissolve.  Further experimentation will utilize a vacuum oven to determine the amount of the assumed conjugate acid that was converted from the playa that went into solution.  Molecular and elemental analysis unfortunately were not available.  

Another topic not touched by this article is the desiccation properties of the playa.  It is from the authors empirical evidence that the playa has considerable desiccation properties that have yet to be quantified.   The particle size might also aid in getting into cracks in the skin causing more desiccation and irritation

Today was not your day.
You're stuck in the bay
we’re off and away!

You have piss in your mouth.
You have bile on your keyboard
You have poison pen letters
drafted for each of the org.
You'll be on your own
And YOU are the guy who'll be feeding our dogs .

You'll look up and down E-bay
And were our dreams shat on too
With your head full of tits and your ears craving dubstep
you're too smart to go wait or believe in “STEP”

And you may not find any scalpers
whom you'll want to trust
If home is what you seek
You must.

It's awesomer there
than stuck home with you

And Out there hot chicks can happen
and frequently do
to people even lamer
and douchier as you.

And when ticketed friends brag
about techo and glitter hoes.
Don't bitch on facebook
While we’re away just poison our grows.

You'll start plotting too.

OH!

THE LENGTHS YOU'LL GO

You'll be emailing all lists yet all out of luck
you’ll be some chump
You'll log back into to tribe
You'll join 99% on their fruitless hunt

YOU HAVE TO GET THERE

Where else can you participate and share
your gift of love to BRC and
wash raver goddess’s minge hair
(thursday 12 – 4pm no fat chicks)

Wherever you try
You may even try to join us self entitled pricks.

Except that you couldn't
Because

I'm glad to say so
and
coz our lanes are already
full of people better’n you.

You’ll harass Logan
Name drop Crimson or some other entity.
you’ll blow dan dasman
to a scalper in some east coast state.

You'll calm down from ALL CAPS POSTING
GRRRR
And find that things often do
Happen to people as lame and douchie as you

You will come to a point where the hope fades and your cards are marked.
the hot hippy chicks are in
Time to go home
How hard could it be
Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare to go in?
How much do you hate to lose? How much do we love to win?

And IF you go in
Simple it's not
for a mind-maker-upper to make up his mind.

You can get so confused
that you'll start in to race
down long plastic orange fence at a break-necking pace
and grind on for miles across weirdish wild space
headed
point 1

...with people just waiting.
Waiting for a hippy to make their day
amid war Cries of Seaaaaaadaaaaawwwwwag
you’ll yearn for the bay

And the chances are you’ll find
some hippy yellow bus

with Oregon plates
you’ll search for a space
hide under luggage
But alas dear reader

Everyone is just waiting.

Waiting for the line to move
or waiting for will call to improve
or waiting around for lost hippies to find their car
or waiting,
or waiting to be ordered from the vehicle by a weary looking clown
or a line to form
or a rummaging hand to find a passenger neglected
or cupboards opened and fridges checked.
Everyone is just waiting.

yes!
That's not for you!

Somehow you'll be caught after all that waiting and staying.
You'll be taken to the bright places
where the bleachers are baying

With jolly roger flying
once more we’ll ride high!
glad of our victory under the sky.
Ready because you're that kind of a guy!

Oh
There are hot chicks to be scored. there are beaver eating contests to be won.
And the magical things you can’t do with this first week of fall
will make you the douchie-est lamer of all.
lame! You'll be lamous as lamous can be
with the whole of PGE will be watching your fall.

I was able to finally connect with some others planning to go and share a bit of excitement but I still feel like my ticket is something I need to keep to myself. I know some feel the same way about theirs. I earned my ticket being who I am consistently for years. I feel scorned by the jealously of others and that's a trip.

Just wondering if anybody else is having really mixed feelings. I know this year is going to be crazy wicked different amazeballs :) and I personally welcome the change! Time to stir the gene pool!

The current ticket shortage has hit us very hard.  We are writing to encourage you to register your camp, and hard figures and data around the current ticket shortage.  What's encouraging is the community is, after the initial ""@$##!!"", pulling together, and some ticket needs are slowly decreasing as camps gage their own ticket inventories and work toward redistribution. Please 'hedge your bets' and register.

""Burning Man’s most important priority is to make sure the community stays intact in the face of the current challenges.""

The ticket shortage is impacting theme camps

I went for the first time last summer, but there must be Whovian Burners, and a Camp TARDIS would be *so goddamn awesome.*

What I can contribute: Last summer I built a [**hexayurt**](http://vinay.howtolivewiki.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/24-2.jpg), with a [**swamp cooler**](http://eplaya.burningman.com/viewtopic.php?t=33842&amp;highlight=cooling+van) to keep it cool.

Set up a bed sheet screen and a projector

Anyone know of any existing camps who may be interested in joining? I'm setting this thing up even if it's just me alone

==========================

Dear Theme Camps

The Burning Man organization has been listening to your concerns and feedback and has come up with a plan to address our current ticket problem that rewards our community in the best way we can. Our blog, and next we are coming to you. Your contribution to the fabric of our event is imperative. The outcome of our ticket process this year was completely unexpected and placed camps have taken the hardest hits. We need to make sure Burning Man stays whole and that means most of the remaining $390 ticket are going to be made available to you.

There are not enough tickets left to distribute to all of the theme camps that would like to come. We have already gone through the painful process of selecting those camps that will be awarded the opportunity to purchase more tickets. In the past we have only had to not place a camp that did not follow our process or was not interactive. Now we have had to figure out a process and make some very hard choices. This has been done using the following criteria:


1. _History_ - Your camp has to be in our database in past years.(We have ways to catch name changes for groups.) We looked for past participation.

2. _Demonstrated Community Benefit_- Your camp has been interactive in a way that has been experienced as meaningful. Your camp provides support for our Burning Man infrastructure. Your camp provides services for our community. Basically

3. _LNT_- Your camp has demonstrated adherence to and good practices around Leave No Trace and are committed to our community perpetuating the message of pack it in-pack it out/ Don't Let It Hit the Ground and sustainability.

4. _10 Principles_ - Your camp fully embraces the 10 principles in their entirety at their core.


This must seem familiar. It is very close to our standard criteria used for placement since 1999

Unfortunately we will not be able to reserve all the tickets needed for any one camp. There simply are not enough tickets. We have considered closely all of the variables associated with the production of your camps and weighed how difficult it is to set up

In order to discover if your camp has been selected for these tickets, this may not be the year to grow your ideas and increase your size. It is the year to gather your resources, hone your message, and open your thoughts to how you can embrace a new era in our evolution.

If you are not planning on attending this year you may be allowing us to redistribute your ticket access to another camp. Proactive communication to us would be appreciated.

We are aware that some of you may be considering applying for low income tickets. That list will be cross-referenced with theme camps tickets so a requester can receive only one ticket. We would like to offer you ticket access through placement and take some of the pressure off of the low income process. Please fill out your questionnaire quickly – by March 8th – so we can let you know if you have been selected.

This year

It is easy to want to find blame in the board, but the truth is this issue is one of supply and demand.Our cumulative successes have created an event that has caught the attention of thousands that want to join us. This shift will be hard this first year, but if we plan well, we can turn this into our greatest success ever.",,False,,False,t3_ps45r

The attendance at BM has been growing every year. Last year was the first year it sold out

What did you EXPECT would happen this year? I thought it would be pretty self evident that tickets would be a problem this year for the first time ever. And I understand that there's burners who've been going for 10-15 years who are facing an unprecedented challenge

You can't fight the numbers. I know burning man is an anti-consumerism anti-capitalism no-money type thing

More people want tickets than can possibly go.

It doesn't matter HOW you ran the ticket sales. If you did it the ""normal"" way

**Can I rent the shuttlecraft for a Bar Mitzvah? My Wedding? My kid’s birthday party? My Star-Trek-themed Halloween Party? My sci-fi convention?**
The shuttlecraft is not street-legal. It’s sorta big. It has to be towed or put on the flatbed of a semi truck. FWIW,700 (truck rental, gas, diesel, anti-matter, etc.).

**You have way
&lt;shrug&gt; Maybe. This is my art; this is what I can do. The shuttle brings happiness to thousands of creatures. It’s very gratifying. You don't have to be a geek

I have been wanting and trying to go to BM for a few years now

First off, and using chemicals to buffer that part of my personality and i want to enjoy BM from a (mostly) sober standpoint. Seeing as this event was full of people who already knew each other or were veteran burners, I made the mistake early on of just wandering and expecting people to pull me in, rather than taking the first step myself. I didn't understand the fully participatory nature of a lot of the attractions and i ended up being a bit of a spectator. For example, I didnt realize that the Hug-Deli was designed for anyone to just go up and get behind the counter - i thought that it was something where the people who set it up worked it. 

There was a large sound camp with an impressive visual display, etc. He smiled and pulled a set of trick concepts LED poi out of his vest! We got to talking for a good while and he introduced me to the creator of a really well known art car in the process.  

I still spent a lot of time wandering, but there were restrictions on when and where, so I found the person to talk to who organized all the fire stuff and got all the waivers signed. I thought it was just going to be a free spin thing after the burn... but i actually signed up for the Fire Conclave!! There were around 25 performers and we had 20 minutes to fill, so i got a GREAT 5 minute session in that left me utterly glowing...

Now, at which i was at the peak of my ability and very proud of myself, I began having A LOT of grand-mal seizures and found out i have a brain tumor/low grade brain cancer. I just finished radiation therapy one week before BEquinox and i wont have a follow up appointment to find out where I stand until this coming Friday. During the intervening 8 months, I've been going though a lot of personal changes, and I like to think they're mostly for the better. 

After we all finished

I know the nightlife after the burn is where the celebration is at

**What is it?**

* C-100 Human Recharge Blend. A hand-made blend of caffeine and B-complex (B1/2/6/12/Niacin). This does an amazing job of recharging your metabolic and CNS batteries. The blend proportions are the result of a year of testing
* L-Theanine. The primary amino acid in Green Tea
* 5-HTP. Less stress
* **Bonus!** Studies have shown that the combination of caffeine with a pain killer (like Aleve or Tylenol (Tylenol + Caffeine = Excedrin) greatly increase the effectiveness of the pain killer. If you have a monster headache

When taken in tandem, and faster recovery from whatever you took the night before. Take with food and lots of water!

**What the hell are you doing?**
Creating is one of my passions. I build new things all the time - from software to electronics to carpentry to metal work.

Last year at BM, and energy drinks way too expensive, heavy, and bad tasting, I decided to come up with something new. After returning home, I promised myself I would develop a solution to my caffeine needs. Months of research, and testing blends resulted in a combination that we both find extremely beneficial. It started with research into what's actually in green tea and coffee

**Where to get some**
I'll be with my camp, or just look for the really, really tall guy. If I'm not in, come another time!

I realize the influx of virgins this year is scary to a lot of people (though i feel the percentages of old to new claimed by some to be quite overblown), as some veterans have been suggesting. I want to hit the playa running and make the most out of my chance to participate in this increasingly exclusive event. 

I would like to know who else is in my situation: starting from scratch. If there are at least a few who are willing

If there's some interest, and attitude.

1328658089.0,pfemr,In 1995 BRC LLC Planned for Regionals to Overtake the Big Burn According to Dr Mercury,vgry,28,6,37,"*Originally posted on the Burner Nerds mailing list.*

To burning-nerds:

Hmm. Well
doctor, I'm also the
regional representative for Burning Man for the state of Connecticut
so I've had the opportunity to eavesdrop on a number of discussions
over the years about the state of the project
ticket sellout fiasco. So I would say: yes and no.

The notion that the Burning Man organization wants to defocus attention on the main event and promote the regionals is not a ""conspiracy theory"", to the point that for the first few years the Burning Man LLC was formed and dissolved every year in the same way that the city was. This stopped when the event grew to such a size that vendors were no longer willing to trade large sums of money with a one-week-old corporation, and by 1995 it became clear that Burning Man was becoming a Permanent Autonomous Zone, which is a contradiction in terms, and everyone knew it.

Two schools of thought emerged. One, limit the size of the
event
desert shooting things and blowing shit up
of thought
permanently
fostering regional events and promoting spread of the philosophy (once they figured out what it was; I don't think the 10 principles appeared until 2001 or so). I don't need to tell you which faction won. John Law was forced out, very successfully I might add.

Fifteen years later
You have only to check the Burning Man regional page to see how many regionals there are; I personally have lost count. Last February some guy was inaugurated as the New Zealand Regional Representative, then you are covered under Burning Man insurance. Did you know that? Oh yes. A huge risk for the organization, but a marvelous lubricator of the bureaucratic wheels for regional burns, and the result is an explosion of regionals, which is exactly what they wanted. The Black Rock Arts Foundations doesn't even fund art on the playa any more. That's how far the focus has shifted.

Meanwhile, arresting people (or charging $300 on the spot) at whim. Art cars are forced to carry fire extinguishers. Theme camps are forced to card minors. Nobody is allowed to serve food to the public any more, not without a Nevada State inspection license. A crowd of biting gnats has descended on the festival--inevitable, anytime the Temporary Autonomous ceases to become Temporary--and the result was predicted by the Burning Man leadership fifteen years ago. And as someone who prowled the Esplanade back in '99, I can assure you the difference is palpable. Is the Burning Man organization de-emphasizing the big burn in favor of the regionals? The answer is a resounding YES!

The other assertion, is not correct. The BLM did an environmental impact analysis of allowing Burning Man to continue versus forbidding it (this analysis is available on the internet, and to my eyes, this analysis was obviously written by a burner, since the consequences of canceling Burning Man are painted in completely apocalyptic terms), and the final decision (good for five years) was that Burning Man would be allowed to grow at a rate of 3% per year. This has never been a problem, particularly with the crash of 2008 which robbed people of disposable income (and Burning Man is pretty disposable for most people). Not until last year, because it's money in their pocket either way, with many different proposals floated. You want to hear one? Everyone has to submit a photograph with their ticket request. The photograph is printed on the ticket. Scalping problem solved. Well, yes. But they are open to suggestions to improve the process

Hardware stores sell it in a variety of lengths and thicknesses; I like 3/8 inch diameter, too skinny.

If you have the proper tools, I couldn't justify investing in a better brand. If you cut your own, don't forget to grind off any burrs and sharp edges (I use a dremel with a grinding stone). How long a stake should be depends on how big and heavy a thing you're anchoring; long enough to drive a good two feet of metal into the playa seems pretty typical. 

While things like Monkey Huts use straight lengths to secure struts, with the junction between pipes where you want the bend to be. Stand on the long end, and pull on the short end to make a U. The pipes give you enough leverage that it doesn't take a lot of muscle. You might be able to get away with one piece of pipe; I feel that two give me better control.

Denizens of Black Rock City: I am nikOpeachZ, and humble servant to the greater kool-aid swilling cult of BRC. A friend about to coordinate part of a 10 and Esplanade camp asked me to help her with their Leave No Trace plan. After some thought, deliberation, and blatant theft from other online LNT and proposals, I came up with this.

Before departing for Black Rock City:

Designate a LNT director to mobilize and organize volunteers for impromptu Moop sweeps during and after the event.
Retain at least 8 cubic feet (2’x2’x2’) of empty space in each vehicle for trash bags on your return.
Plan to haul out more than you brought into BRC. Spend the extra money for smaller sized contractor bags. The durability will save you broken bags of stinky mess
Invest in a Moop-stick. You want one w/ a suction cup end. The money spent is worth not bending over for every piece of micro-trash. (£7 or $10 online)
Duct Tape the edges before leaving for the playa.
Do NOT bring sequins, cheap belly-dancer bangles, flimsy paper. (Flyers left in Centr Camp end up in a burn barrel or on the trash fence.)
Remove excess packaging from everything possible.
Plan for and utilize advanced grey water evaporation ponds.
For each camp, flat shovel, spade shovel, push broom, and numerous pairs of vise grips.
Bring mesh bags to dry out moist garbage
Plan easy to prepare/no clean up meals for less work
Do NOT bring disposable plates/cups/silverware. Do NOT give out cups at your bar. Bring yer Blissware! (if someone doesn’t have a cup, be merry.)
Educate ALL members of camp about the LNT ethic.
Upon Arrival in BRC:

Clean Up begins when you arrive in BRC. Don’t let it hit the Ground.
Utilize drop cloths/ground cover when unloading large vehicles/trucks. (8x10 tarp staked flat. Small stakes will suffice.) It only takes 5 minutes to tack down
Secure everything against the wind. Shade structures, even your hat will want to blow away.
Cover the playa with ground cover wherever people gather. Under shade, recycled billboards, canvas, carpet (heavy and nasty when filled with playa), or weed barrier are options. If you can sweep it, you can keep it clean and keep moop off the playa.
Place drop cloth/staked cardboard under fluid leaking vehicles and generators.
Place drop cloth under firewood piles (before unloading) Wood chips are some of the most frustrating and time consuming of Moop Hot-Spots.
Transform empty 1 and 2 gallong water jugs into Moop buckets by cutting a 5” hole in the top, carry at least one Moop bucket for trash and treasures discovered during your foray into BRC. Be proud that you are utilitarian as well as fashionable in your accessory choice.
Throughout the Event

Pick up moop immediately when you see it. You will have less energy and it will be less fun on Sunday/Monday.
Separate recycleables
Perform daily moop patrols and Line Sweeps in heavily trafficked areas within your camp and in all surrounding areas.
Smash every can/plastic bottle/trash as compact as possible before depositing in recycling… You will be grateful for the smaller trash bags.
Carry your own Blissware everywhere (reusable personal beverage cup, rinse and scrub with water, drink water with food debris, rinse again, drink, and Voila! Dishes Done!
Educate, and Cajole any messy members of your camp (and the city) to keep their shit/moop tight. They make the mess that you will clean up later.
Bring regular deposits of smashed aluminum cans to Recycle Camp in the Center Camp circle.
Upon departure from Black Rock City:

Line Sweeps
Pack each vehicle as efficiently as possible and make sure to send early departing vehicles with as many trash bags as possible. Don’t leave your friends on playa with spare space in your car because they will end up with piles of garbage bags that cannot be safely packed into their rig. Secure your load to withstand 70+ mph winds if outside the vehicle.
Ensure that enough people stay behind to handle the footprint of your camp. The best laid plans of LNT camps mean little when too few people are left behind to erase your trace.
To save space and weight for a long drive back to civilization, cigarettes, porn, non-perishable food, unopened mixers, full propane bottles, condoms, lotion, badges, and better smelling DPW at the Collexodus station immediately before gate road (6 and past L). DON’T be fooled by imitations! Accept only these surly black shirted hooligans as worthy recipients of your gift. The DPW have spent one month on Playa by the time you leave
Strike big structures and trash piles as quickly as possible. When the city begins to disappear
Break up hardened grey water stains with landscape rake to free and erase micro-moop.
Rebar can be extracted with vise grips by twisting and spinning until it pulls out.
Broken off t-stakes can be dug out around the top, they can remove it and keep it out of someones tire next summer.
After an area is cleared of ALL vehicles and tents, money, and mystery pills overlooked. (Line Sweeps are so important, they are worth mentioning thrice).
Bring usable lumber (stripped of hardware) and plywood to gift Burningman to build next years event at donation stations located near burn platforms along the Esplanade.
If you don’t have to leave on Sunday or Monday, read the address, go there.

1308149012.0,i0bxv,Ez's Burning Man Supply List 2011,oh_bother,24,3,26,"I was chatting with a local burner and mentioned it would be my first trip out to Black Rock

Welcome to EZ's Burning Man supplies 2011 edition.

Getting started:

Below is my base list of supplies for the burn. I tend to over pack

The burn will come quicker than you think and no matter how prepared you are

Enjoy and feel free to share this with anyone you think might benefit from reading this.

* BOARDING PASS

* BURNING MAN TICKET
* EARLY ARRIVAL PASS (if applicable)

**Toiletries and Body Care:**

* 2 x Deodorant

* Soap
* Shampoo: (Dr.Bronner's is great!)
* 4x Toilet paper rolls
* 2x Towel
* Razor &amp; shaving cream
* 1-2x Boxes of Baby wipes: (Highly recommended. It's enitrely up to you if you want scented or not)
* 2x Chapstick
* Lotion
* Vinegar: (The desert is made of alkali dust and can cause some discomfort on your feet if you don't always wear proper footwear. Don't plan on going barefoot
* Earplugs: (Some parties are just too loud
* Allergy meds
* Pedialyte: (Extremely good for hangovers and hydration
Saline nose rinse (Not needed

* Hand sanitizer: (At least a bottle or two
* 2x Sunscreen: (Same has Hand sanitizer)
* Camel back: (I find myself rarely using mine
* 2x Water bottles: (I prefer ones that you can put carabiners through)

**Sleeping Gear:**

* Tent
* Air Mattress &amp; pump
* Sleeping bag
* Pillows: (You can bring a carry on bag and a pillow for the plane)
* Blanket: (Nights are insanely cold. I tend to cover myself in my sleeping bag

**Dining:**

* Fork/Knife/Spoon: (Disposables are bad, or loan them out and never find them again)
* Bowl: (see Fork/knife/spook)
* Plate: (see Fork/knife/spook)
* Large Cup: (Tons of people will have free drinks to share
* Coffee Mug: (This can be the same as your large cup

**Tools:**

* Leatherman: (I find at least some set of small tools to be extremely useful)
* Ziplock Bags: (great for packing and organizing while you're out there. They can be super handy for keeping electronics safe
* Tennis balls: (for tent spikes
* Duct tape: (There is always a use for duct tape and zipties
* Zip ties
* Vice Grip: (good for pulling up rebarb
* Work Gloves: (in a safety 3rd world
* Portable Sewing Kit and Safety Pins: (because wardrobe malfunctions happen)

**Electronics:**

~Disorient has power. Cables run through out the camp, your camp may vary, check your local listings.
* Camera
* Batteries

**Misc:**

* Book: (I like the idea of bringing your favorite book to gift later You may want something for the plane
* Bike &amp; Lock: (there are a variety of services that sell burner bikes for cheap that you can pick up on the way from reno. There is also a massive walmart in Reno that sells cheap bikes. They are not needed
Note Book (I try to bring at least two. One normal size and one pocket. You'll find lots of things and people you'll want to remember and dont have the luxury of a phone to take notes with)
Pens &amp; Sharpie (at least a few pens)
* Small Tubs/Bins: (these are more complicated to take with if you are not shipping some of your stuff out. I find they help me avoid living entirely out of my luggage bags and helps me keep some things organized)

**Clothing:**

~It is extremely easy to overpack clothing. There are no real right or wrongs here. The burn is a chance for you express yourself in any way you wish
* Winter / Fur / Warm coat
* Bathing Suit: (multiple tops for ladies)
* Hoodie
* A warm comfy outfit to sleep in
* Thermals
* Return trip clothing: (I usually set an outfit aside that I have in a plastic bag

**Wearable Accessories:**

* Backpack / Travel bag: (I usually bring both)
* Utility Belt / Fanny Pack: (Ideal for the playa. The more you have to carry
* Flip-flops/Sandles/Slippers (I like some form of comfy foot wear. You're going to do an insane amount of walking and it's nice to have something comfy on your feet when you're back at camp that protects your skin from the playa)
* Warm hat: (wool
* 3x Bandanna: (painters masks and gas mask style things work as well
* 2x Goggles: (I usually bring two shaded for the day &amp; two clear night
* Scarf
* 2x Sunglasses: (cheap disposable)
* Sock pack: (brand new 12 pack. You will want at least one brand new pair of socks per day)
* 2x Belts:
* Gloves: (I like a cheap fingerless pair for the evenings)
* Leg Warmers / Thigh High Socks
* Underwear

When deciding what clothes to bring it's important to be aware that the days are hot and the nights are cold. A mix of things for both is great

The lottery really is making me sad.

It goes against several of the core principles.

&gt;Gifting

This system encourages hoarding

&gt;Radical Self-reliance

The lottery is the *opposite* of self-reliance. Getting a ticket isn't a function of myself being reliant and responsible

&gt;Communal Effort

This one should be pretty obvious. The lottery does the opposite of encouraging community. It pits us against each other.

I haven't gotten my confirmation yet, and I'm sure that I'll figure out how to get my ticket either through my network, or STEP or whatever, I'm just disappointed in them for fucking up *this* hard, and not being willing to say ""hey, guys, sorry."".

The problem started at Burning Man 2009. Specifically Build Week of Burning Man 2009. Everyone was happy as a clam, informing us that if we needed to leave the city during Build Week (which, having many more loads left, we had to do many times), we would have to pay the re-entry fee. Before the event STARTED.

Now, and then going back to Gerlach to try to find a room. Or leaving every day to go shopping. The re-entry fee helps discourage spectators. But this was now put into effect when the only people in the city were already putting significant amounts of their own time and money into making something for the event, often with further trips out of the city required to finish their projects. They needed to go get more supplies? Fuck 'em. Make them pay.

Now that was annoying, was the change that BMorg made shortly before Build Week 2010. This was when they kindly informed us that whereas the previous arrangement for truckers carrying theme camp equipment was to take their credit card information and not charge them if they were out of the city within three hours (a fair and useful system), now we just had to buy them a ticket. Even though they WEREN'T ATTENDING THE EVENT. The reasons given were this, quoted from their e-mail:

. To find a better balance between de-commodification and radical self-reliance.

. To encourage communal effort and hopefully lessen the overall environmental impact of our event.

. ""Refundable"" vendor tickets created a disproportionate drag on our staffing resources and were frequently abused.

. Expedited vendor access at entry reduces wait times for everyone.

No details were given about how the previous system was abused, make Burning Man greener, or encourage self-reliance. This is the Burning Man Organization building on a pattern, a pattern of punishing those that are contributing most to the event simply to line their own pockets.

1329660396.0,pwfbj,Our road ahead - bringing Burner culture to Burning Man,nastrus,26,6,11,"From back here in the cheap seats

Do you remember your first year at Burning Man?  Of course you do, ""This is amazing, I am coming back next year!” for the very first time.  The same can be said of how some of started our first journey, we read or heard stories and something in them drew us from our comfortable lives to go spend a week battling sunburn, dehydration, and heat stroke.

A photograph started my journey toward the desert that first time, decommodification, community effort, civic responsibility, participation, immediacy, and gifting.  Physically the photo showed a moment in time where a community pulled together to help mask the logos on a rented truck. Veterans helping new people find their way in to our culture, so everyone did.  

Here is the problem as I see it:  We want Burning Man delivered to us in the way we remember it, we don’t talk to our neighbors and make them a part of us as much, we don’t go all out to cover our logos and set the environment that supports and grows our values and tenants as much.  We have nested, made ourselves far too comfortable and now we've brought to Burning Man what we had at home.  We get off our couches and work really hard to build a better, novelty sized couch with a bitchin' sound system and 150 horsepower, and then sit down on it instead.

Now I am not saying that people don't work hard or that nobody does their part to make Burning Man happen or hold close our principles to their hearts.  People do, to bring it CULTURALLY, then we will be left behind wondering what happened to that thing we loved.  If we do not adapt to the challenges of our time, then we give up our franchise and we silence ourselves better than any outside force, boogie monster, or invading army of virgins on their way to the ""world's biggest party"" might be able.  To invoke the stone soup metaphor, it is what we make of it

I think that there is little debate here, to really take our participation to the next level and to cause the culture we want to be a part of.  Make the people who don’t seem to get it your friends, show them what is special about this space that we make for ourselves out of nothing.  Treat these people as a part of the whole, as a part of your neighborhood, your community, your burn, and they will act a part of who we are.  Give up, insulated from us

Sometimes the hardest thing to do in life is to remember that we are capable of loving each other.  What you do when you reach out to extend the Burning Man culture to others is a gift of love from yourself to them.  Open your heart and just say it.  Welcome to our street, welcome home.

I felt like the percentage of virgins to non-virgins was higher than it may have been in the past

Quick disclaimer.  This was only my second burn and I only have my two years of personal experience and what I've gleamed from conversations with burners who have been going for considerably longer than I have.

Burning Man and burner events are made on the backs and sweat of those who participate.  Unlike other events in which an organizer makes all of the decisions as to what will be happening at the event

What I think people fail to realize about this is the following.  

If there is something that you feel the event is lacking

If there is something going on at the event that you wish would change

For those who are frustrated with how the event was different this year, you can complain about, or you can do something about it.

One of the biggest things I think we can all do is ensure that tickets end up in the correct hands to start off with.  Years past, encourage them to buy a ticket anyways.  A ticket to burning man is as good as cash in your pocket.  I had close to 10 people I knew who didn't get their tickets in time, and out of those 10, only one never go this ticket.  And he didn't get one because he gave up a full three weeks before the event.  

As a community we can ensure that tickets are getting in to the right hands.  We can ensure that virgins know about the ten principles.  Burning man is our event.  It will grow,,False,,t5_2qj68,False,,True
