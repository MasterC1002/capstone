In other multiplayer games, everyone was very open and willing to teaching me the game -- telling me what buildings do and being very willing to follow orders, trusting my judgement despite the fact that I was so new.

Another aspect that I feel is more unique to me is the fact that the people playing this game seem to be very open to younger gamers. I've always been afraid to use my mic when online, the people playing Natural Selection didn't simply tolerate the fact that I was young -- they welcomed it, encouraging that I use my mic and supporting me when the few people who disagreed with letting me play spoke their mind.

I started to play commander very early on, and I became the best commander on the server within a couple of matches.

1357641296.0,166ei3,Some tips for new commanders,Gmarx,109,17,50,"Here's some advice/tips/facts for new commanders

**General Stuff**

* Use a mic.
* If you are worried about criticism
* A resource tower gives you one resource every 6 seconds.
* Some people (NS1 vets?) refer to both harvester and extractor simply as ""RT"".

**As Marine commander**

* You start with 45 res. That is enough to build (2) extractors

* If you have less than 8 marines


* In Pubs
* Phase tech is researched at the Observatory. You will then have to build actual Phase Gates to start ""teleporting.""
* Unless you've discovered a brilliant early-robo strategy (hint: you haven't), that is 55 res. To put that in perspective, 55 res could have bought you phase tech + (2) phase gates + (1) armory at your new base.
* Every phase gate is both an entrance and an exit. I only bring this up because I've actually seen comms build 2 phase gates in the main base
* On the subject of mines: they are great. Getting your team to actually buy them is a whole 'nother problem though. My tip is that you (the comm) start with 20 res just like everyone else. If you have researched mines
* Don't research shotguns in the first couple minutes without asking if your team will actually buy them. Most people won't. Even then
* Hotkey each observatory (select observatory and hit cntrl + #). The keyboard shortcut for distress beacon is ""s"". That way
* On the subject of bacon, an obs in Overlook will beacon to Sub-Sector (same with The Neck-Pipeline). This comes in handy when you realize that alien attacks on Sub generally come from System Waypointing, and Pipeline attacks generally come from Utility. Note - an observatory that is powered (i.e.- Overlook) can beacon to an unpowered CC nearby (Sub-Sector).

* On the subject of building placement, open ""firing"" line for most marines. Those of you who have tried to kill a skulk in Shipping (Tram) in that lousy confined base might be able to relate. Although, having an armory in open space allows marines to dance around it and be healed enough to reload and shoot the skulk chasing him.
* Learn the keyboard shortcuts for assistance. Ammo (E-A), Observatory Scan (E-F).
* Pressing [space] will snap to the marine that called for health/ammo using q/z, and at my next click, a health pack will appear. My marines generally don't wait more than 2 seconds for commander candy.
* Placing ammo directly on a marine is not always best. Sometimes they have run dry on LMG ammo, drop it immediately in front of them.
* A single ammo drop will completely refill a weapon's ammo. Many comm's incorrectly (but understandably) believe 1 box = 1 clip.
* If marines are on the move and are requesting health/ammo
* More shortcuts: Extractor (Q-S)
* ARCs (those tank things) can shoot through walls. This requires line of sight to the target either through direct Marine vision
* If you have good aim, or for any other reason think you will die when you hop out, don't do it. If you die, there will be no one to trigger a beacon if necessary.
* Dropping 30 scans in 10 seconds at the last hive is a great way to celebrate a victory.
* Lastly

**Edit 1**:
[TycoCelchuuu has reminded me about the armor 1 / weapons 1 debate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/166ei3/some_tips_for_new_commanders/c7tc0sd?context=3) Tyco has a youtube channel. I'm in his marine commander tutorial video

**Armor 1 (A1)**: Marines at a0 have 160 effective health (100 health + 30 armor, and parasite does 10 damage. 3 perfect bites deals 225 damage, killing a marine regardless of whether he has a0 or a1. However, Parasite + 2 perfect bites will exactly kill an a0 marine (160 damage done), but an a1 marine would survive. At A2 (240 effective health), a marine can survive 3 perfect bites.

**Weapons 1 (W1)**: Regardless of whether you have w0 or w1

So does that mean you should get A1 before W1? I think so. Yes, at which point you probably have W3. When in doubt, A1-W1-W2-W3-A2-A3.


**Edit 2**:
 [Kordie has reminded people to use nano-shield on buildings


**As Alien Commander**

* In the early-game, this isn't Starcraft, and infestion =/= creep. You don't get vision of stuff walking over infestation (although you do get a smokey cloud effect). I know that most rookies can't help but shoot cyst, but if you want map vision, use drifters instead. 

* Use **drifters**. Place them at important chokes. For instance on ns2_Veil this would be System Waypointing, The Dome, Overlook. All other maps have a central locations, in which a drifter should always be there at the very least. Experience will tell you where to place other drifters. Also, drifters currently have no collision model, so marines can't accidentally bump into them (this might be changed eventually). They can, however

* Also, it will go there. Useful for if you are diligent enough to buy drifters, but always find 5 at your hive being kind of useless. With a rally, you might find 5 drifters being redundantly useful at Hub/Central Drilling/Courtyard/Crossroads, but at least you can quickly send them to useful locations.

* When in doubt

* If you choose camo first, camo is rendered useless. An Onos without carapace is not very intimidating. An Onos without celerity has a difficult time retreating.

* Please don't ever upgrade shade as your second hive. For similar reasons as above.

* Use drifters. The drifter ability ""Enzyme"" increases alien attack speed by 25% for (6?) seconds. Useful for hitting observatories

* Regarding Enzyme: it is an Area of Effect ability (as opposed to Point-Based AoE; I believe I'm using these terms correctly). You click on the drifter (ideally it is hot-keyed) click on Enzyme (or use the shortcut ""z"") and click anywhere on the map near the drifter. The drifter will shoot a red dart a pop some red dust. Any alien in the radius of the dust will receive Enzyme effect for whatever the duration is. I address this to correct the misconception that some may have that Enzyme is only popped around the drifter itself (much like Ink or Healing wave function on Shades and Crags

* In the early game

* Don't forget you start with 20 res. That is enough to go gorge and drop hydras (either in base to protect hive/upgrades or the nearest harvester). Also, he might not be suspicious of a random assortment of clogs at your hive.

* Also

Like most newbies this weekend

Then we got a new commander named VIGIL who was a complete change. This commander went out of his way to explain super basic things like what jetpacks were and why you always want one or how to use bile bombs to demolish a base. He never lost his cool at anyone for making a mistake and worked with them to teach them not to make the same mistake again (even when I couldn't find the power node in a room and lost a push for our team.) 

The game actually started to become fun. Instead of running around aimlessly our heard of newbies actually started to work together and get objectives and we had some really awesome games. 

That good commander singlehandedly turned me from uninstalling to loving and buying the game and I'm sure there's other freeweekers just like me who joined purely because a commander took the time to guide them.

So to VIGIL and to all the other commanders that took the time to guide us new players THANK YOU!

1374170618.0,1iknvc,Dear Veterans playing during the summer sale,nsfade,78,17,50,"Please stop complaining about servers filled with rookies. Have a little patience with the new guys

I know we constantly tell the rookies to speak up and ask questions

Example: I was commanding a mixed group of rookies on Docking. My team was listening but they just needed some extra guidance. Then joins a relatively veteran player. First thing he says ""god rookies have ruined this game""... Next thing I notice he is screaming at the team ""Bar and Cafe are getting hit!"". The team does not really react. After recapping it happens another time and the team does not respond. Veteran player: ""See! This is why I hate rookie games!"" and he proceeds to rage and leave the server

After a brief moment of silence, and what I said to my team at that time, was: ""If you look at your map (tell them to press C), Bar and Cafe are behind our front lines. The aliens are getting behind and killing our Extractors. We need at least one or two people to respond to this. This is important because if we lose extractors, we gain less resources, and winning is all about resources. Also, make sure only one or two people react. If the whole team falls back to protect Bar and Cafe

This took me all of 20 seconds to say. Immediately four rookies spoke up

If you want to survive *and* get kills as a skulk

**Don't move to attack across the ground level** 

Running along the ground is what rookie marines expect. All their weapons will already be aimed at around knee level so you'll be running into a wall of death. In the same vein...

**You auto-attach to walls and the ceiling

Your movement

**Attack Vertically

Given that you've followed the first two tips

**Ambush tactics are the best tactics**

Skulks have millions of places to hide and each marine only has one field of view. Instead of rushing down a hallway into that squad of marines consider having *one* skulk on your team lure into your room then attacking at once when they get halfway in. Skulks are individually weak

edit: Forgot one:

**Turn out the Lights**

Marines, instruct your teammates to rush the power node down to one bite left then take ambush positions. When the marines come streaming in, wait till they make it to about the halfway point of the area then finish the node. Even with their flashlights marines will be at an extreme disadvantage during the 30 or so seconds before the hazard lights activate in the area. Use this time to pick off marines with their flashlights off, marines that have separated to run to safety, and generally as a natural form of invisibility when planning your hit and run attacks.

**By [eisbaer66](http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/12ilbw/skulk_tips/c6vd4d8):**

**Make your bites count**

Don't go into a bite frenzy when you attack. You are better of getting on the next wall/ceilling and start a new attack

Also try to look slightly up when you approach a marine

Join [r/ns2 steamgroup](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ns2reddit) and join the steam chat. We have a friendly and helpful community. We have 3 NA servers going at the moment and we do PUGs (pick up games) every Wednesday. Friday the 21st we'll try to do some pugs to help the newbies learn a bit. Join the steam group and download mumble. 

We'll be doing a lot of pugs this fri-sat as long as people keep showing up. We will start around 7pm est whenever we have enough to pick teams.

I'm working on www.ns2hub.com with a few great people from the community and I'd recommend anyone interested in ns2 bookmark it. We'll be updating it a lot with info on what is going on in the community and we'll keep it posted with events.

edit: This is more than just a plug for the steam group. We really have a great active community and it's the best way to get into this game. Playing on random public servers just isn't the best way to experience this game.

Here's something you rookies should know: No one cares if you are new as long as you speak up.  If you don't communicate

NS2 players are all more than willing to help out rookies, start dropping random items while ignoring all of the advice people are trying to give, people are going to just get mad and yell at you. If you don't respond to people asking ""can you hear us"" ""drop this"" ""do this then this"", people are going to get mad at you. We already know that you have next to no clue what you're doing. People want to help you, but only if you are willing to listen. In the past. I've had rookie commanders drop random items and not listen to people, only to be ejected. And then the ejected rookie will actually start shit talking the team for ejecting them.

Generally, although now that alien commanding requires more than a pulse, it's not a great idea to jump in the chair either.  Good commanders are crucial to winning a game, especially as marines, where med packs and ammo are readily available to drop.

Say something! If you say you need help, if you say nothing, if you don't communicate, THAT'S when you get people raging at you.  I literally turn into tutorial bot when there's an flux of rookies, just saying ""press b to open your evolution page!"" ""make sure to weld your follow teammates when their armor is low!"" ""build the power node before building anything else!""

Ask tons of questions.  We'll help you.  In fact, especially if you're new, check out this incredibly extensive video my friend made.

From the vibe there, the interaction between teammates and the commander personally giving you keys to the exosuit had players much more invested into the game. The UWE staff was friendly with teaching new players how to play a lifeform, or command a team.

So how can we improve the 10 minute play-by experience? Most people with give the game a try

I suggest that the UWE team make a modded 5v5 game specifically for PAX exhibitions. There should be an admin that can take control of the tide of battle by allowing new players that are just dropping in to give the fade a try or be able to use higher technology. This will allow the player to see what the game really has to offer. 

What other suggestions would you give UWE to improve the 10 minute PAX booth experience?

Held them off in Cargo for about another 20 mins as they kept sending waves and waves of Mechs at us. Eventually we got most of their mech.

They then sneaked attacked our second hive in Pipe with about 10 Arcs. Destroyed that hive but we did get their arcs. In the counter push we were able to destroy Control but had to rush back to Cargo and go their as it was destroyed. Finished off the mech and inf in Cargo rebuilt hive but in the process they rebuilt control. It seemed like eventually they just ran out of res.

I just never died as Onos which probably saved the game since we needed every single Onos to win that game. Pretty surprising since most games are decided in the first couple mins and that was my first true long game where it could have gone either way.

~~This is what you need to do:~~

~~- have an option under vote called: balanced teams~~
~~- if enough players vote yes

~~The way the system works is that it splits players based on the scores that they got from last round. So if you have players with the scores 200, it will place the 200 with the 100 player and the 150 with the 75 player. So you keep doing this until the readyroom is empty. For players with tied scores or 0 as their score, it reverts to random assignment for those players.~~

~~It's not perfect, which can still stack teams. I play many games of NS2 and out of maybe every 3 games, only 1 of them turns into a really close and exciting match. The other games turn into egg-locked aliens or marines that can't hold onto more than 2 resource towers.~~

~~And before you say this system sounds weird... **It's been used in pretty much all of the Call of Duty games for years.**~~

~~Please UWE

~~**EDIT:** I've responded to some posts that have concerns. I would like to remind people that I'm not saying this is the BEST solution for balanced teams, this is a vote system, so if people do not want to use it... VOTE.~~

~~I've also thought up a better version of this system: If you have 8 players on the server ranked in order of ABCDEFGH, then the system alternates with C going to team 2, then D going to team 1, team 1 getting E, team 2 getting F, team 1 getting H and team 2 getting G. So the teams will look like this:~~

~~Team 1 - ADEH~~

1358133917.0,16j2t7,Interesting marine strategy in Brazilian servers,Tizoptera,38,5,32,"During the last week I've seen a new marine strategy while playing in pub servers here in Brazil. It seems to not have spread yet

It's basically a rush for sentries and MACs

The first time I saw it was as alien on Tram and I laughed since, and I would build up the second hive there as gorge.

About a minute later, but the MACs just repaired it way faster than spit could damage it and I died again. That's when I realized we had already lost the game, because as skulks, lerks and bile-bomb-less gorges there is no way in hell we could out-DPS the MACs' healing rate while avoiding sentry fire. Soon, there were sentry and MAC nests on both sides of Shipping hive, trapping us in.

In that game

Of course

So, but it is an all-in push. If enough MACs and sentries go down, it is very likely GG since this will put the marines so far behind the usual tech curve that they could be overwhelmed.

Unless you're gorging it up from the get-go, waste no time getting there. That's where all of the action will be, and you need to be sure you're in position for step 2.

**Step two: Deny attempts to expand

You're far too under-equipped to go charging into the base already. What you need to do is push them back to the entrances of their base, and do not over extend. Just prevent them from moving out. Make sure they aren't able to sneak out from the other side and begin expanding in that direction--it doesn't hurt to do a sweep around to other resource nodes on the other side to be safe. The longer you keep them holed up the better, even if they eventually break free.

1331839505.0,qy75k,Beta Build 200,Stergeary,33,2,43,"Hit a big number on the base-10 numbering system!  ~~Anyone have the list of changes?  I can't seem to find it on the site or the forums.~~  Change log has just been posted!  As follows:

**Features**

* Added alien commander ability called Catalize. This speeds the evolution

* New Cyst and Mini-Cyst model.
* Wounded players or structures are now indicated in the Gorge HUD.
* Added icons for each weapon type for the pickup icon user interface.
* Added new Veil upgrade: Silence
* Changed alien evolution model: now each upgrade structure (Shell, Regeneration, etc.). Then aliens can choose that evolution, which will be at full power. This is much simpler than the previous ""scalable"" model where the number of chambers indicated the power of the upgrade (and it wasn't used anyways).
* The Mature Whip will now auto attack targets with Bombard if they are nearby but not close enough to whack (Thanks Matso!)

**Fix**

* Distress Beacon will only respawn players next to a built Command Station (not unbuilt).
* Fixed a bug where spit could slow a Marine by 80% (should have been 50%)
* Fixed discrepancies between the server and client animations when checking if bullets hit.
* Fixed bug causing a script error sometimes when issuing an order to an AI unit.
* Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause problems on round reset.
* Fixed a bug where Skulks could not climb up a wall when camouflaged or walking (thanks Matso!)

* Fixed bug where Marine Commander could not manually socket a power node without dropping a structure nearby.
* Fixed camouflage slow walking for Fade and Skulk.
* Fixed script error that sometimes occurred when a grenade was whacked by a Whip.
* Check that the entity hasn't been deleted before calling OnThink.
* Fixed a couple of cases where the Pistol would stop shooting.
* Fixed bug where the Whip would move a bit on it's own right after finishing construction.
* Fixed bug preventing the health of a connected Phase Gate from displaying to non-Commander players.
* Changed ground jumps for Skulks to only modify y velocity. in rare situations the Skulks y axis could have been off and cause accelerating when spamming jump on ground.
* Added a minimap blip for the Phase Gate.
* Fixed bug preventing the Crag Umbra ability from playing a sound.
* Fixed bug allowing ""use"" on structures when not close enough to their ""use"" area (Command Station for example)
* Fixed a bug where you could shadow step during blinking.
* Fades won't get stuck anymore in the jump animation after blinking.
* Fixed bug where shadow step + blink used at the same moment resulted in insane speed increase.
* Detect &amp; protect against a race condition in PhysX.
* Reduced general air friction. fixes problem with Gorges

**Change**

**Aliens**

* Reduced Skulk ground base speed to 7.2 from 8 (still slightly higher than pre 199)
* Skulks will stick less often unintended to walls.
* Gorge can now belly slide off infestation again and benefits from sliding down ramps.
* Reduced Fade shadow step cooldown to give more freedom since it's anyway controlled through another soft cooldown.
* Added a soft cooldown for shadow step. When you perform a shadow step within 1.7 seconds it's effectiveness is reduced.
* Adjusted Fade camera position and added subtle camera animations.
* Added more air control to Fades.
* Players won't be forced anymore to always blink forward.

**Sound**

The game started with a new commander
the hive. The commander dropped celerity and we pushed them back


Nano was secured with a single gorge, where they got a phase gate up. I dropped a shift there quickly, and kept spawning eggs while telling a few others to set up in topographical. The gorges
in cargo put up a clog wall and hydras to hold off the onslaught of marines
save for the hive drop.


As soon as I'm able to drop the hive, having no
other options. As soon as it's dropped it starts getting hit
and start spawning eggs there. Once we destroyed a few arcs and pushed them out of cargo again (still in Y) I get gorge tunnels and my gorges in topo get a tunnel from
pipeline to topo

We take Control without any real issues
After taking Control the marine team takes out nanogrid and gets a phase gate in there, and Skylights so I actually had a net gain with
my res flow. Another shift popped down in Control
taken down again. I get a few eggs off in Overlook before the shift is taken out and we're beat back to Skylights

Control goes up quickly thanks to a gorge building it
My team retakes overlook and starts pushing into Sub while they're busy with Cargo still.

The only advanced life-form we've had up until this point has been a single Lerk
goes Onos, and a lerk hit Sub. I tell them to fall back after marines start coming in through the phase gate, and I set up crags in Overlook.

Then somebody else goes Onos in overlook, taking out the power.

While this is happening
conceded.

This was the craziest back and forth game I have ever played
Probably the first game of NS2 I have ever played where the only reason we won was because of strategy and not skill.

I will probably start recording my games after this one,,False,self,t5_2rfpj,False,,True

Alien Tactics:

1. Gorges. It's real easy. Just bile bomb the power from a doorway

2. If that doesn't work

3. Front line crags/shifts/drifters. As alien commander you have incredible power to turn a fight. No better time than when you're trying to make this the last fight. So, and allow you to use the rest of your command abilities to turn the battle. This is for when the gorge/onos bile bombings can't hold the line long enough to finish the job. 

""But, yes, the caveat. If your attacks on the power are held off by exos, you're going to have to kill the exos first. Just use the same strategy as on the power, but try not to waste onos' on them. A couple dodging skulks and some bile can take out exos easily. Add enzyme and exos melt. 

Marine Tactics:

1. Hold X, there's no shame in conceding. It's an honorable acknowledgement that the match has been decided. GG, and vote for the next map. 

2. Recycle the Infantry Portals. If your team is too ashamed to admit defeat, or the command chair dies, the match ends.

3. Arcs. If you do in fact find yourself unable to break an alien team, so use scans in the room you want to obliterate.

edit: more thoughts to add. 

You can't just kill marines during a turtle. Most of the game killing is not for the sake of killing, all the territory is won already, and it's really hard to kill marines faster than they spawn, so you have to fight for time in indirect ways. You have to draw their fire, nerf their attacks, and force them to do anything other than shoot your gorges.

One lerk with spores and umbra has a huge impact. Both spores and umbra block vision, they're choosing the negative space to box marines in, forcing them to dodge and scatter into corners, or into one spot where a xeno or two will be devastating.

Fades can vortex armories to stop healing, fades are the best equipped to avoid damage while still demanding marines' attention. So do your best to harass and bait, get as many marines as you can to chase you out of base. Act scared and they are more likely to chase. While they chase you out one door, send in the onos/gorges through the other door. 

Skulks can xenocide in pairs to kill packs of marines, fades to target the gl's/flames, and onos/gorges to kill the power.

It is the basic foot soldier. It is the lowest common denominator. 

**As an alien player

This is the first part to a Series of Themed Guides.

---

Your Basic Stats:
---
* Health: 70
* Armor: 10    
* Gestation Time: 3 Seconds

Weapons:
---
**Bite** - Melee Strike
    * 75 Damage per Bite
    * 0.75 Second Delay
       
**Parasite** - Ranged Hitscan attack that marks the target to be seen through walls by yourself and other players
    * 10 Damage per Hit
    * 0.5 Second Delay

**Leap** - Hive2 Ability that gives the Skulk a burst of speed. 

**General Abilities**
---

**Alien Vision**- A default alien ability given to all aliens which **will highlight terrain and players despite lighting conditions.
   ** 
    
**Stalk** - Holding the (Shift) key will cause the player to move slowly

**Passive Ability:**
---

**Wall-running** - Skulk specific ability that allows the skulk to move along the walls and ceilings. Vision will slightly tilt in accordance with the skulk's position to the floor. **Using the Stalk ability in conjunction will increase grip.**

--- 
How long will it take for you to die?
---

Let's take a look at the Typical Marine Weapon Stats. For the sake of simplicity

**Assault Rifle**
    * 10 damage per bullet
    * Fire Delay of 0.0555 seconds
    
With full accuracy
Given a 50% hit rate due to bullet spread or human error

**Shotgun**
    * 1-20 damage per pellet
    * 10 pellet spread per shot
    * Damage potential of up to 200
    * Fire Delay 0.9 seconds 

A skulk will die instantly to a full
At longer ranges

**Conclusion:** Marines can kill skulks very quickly given the opportunity. And don't fuck with people carrying shotguns.

---
How long will it take to kill a Marine?
---

**Non-upgraded Marine Stats**

* Health: 100
* Armor: 30

Given 3 bites and ideal delay times

However

**Conclusion:** Use parasite on Marines to reduce the kill-time.

---
How does Leap Work?
---

*Firstly*, only gravity will influence your travel time per leap. **So when you are traveling with the leap ability, aim your leaps upward so that you will cross longer distances.** 

*Secondly*

---
TL;DR
---
* Use Alien Vision in Low-Light Situations
* Holding the Shift button makes it easier to walk on the walls/ceiling
* You are squishy. Don't get in a Marine's line of sight!
* Parasite before you Bite
* Aim upwards when you leap to travel further and longer
* You can leap in mid-air to change direction and velocity

I'll admit that I wasn't sold on the mods when they were first introduced and thought they were a pain to use. I subscribed for a few and did not realize that I had to enable them in the game menu under ""Mods"". Once I figured out how to subscribe and enable them I was HOOKED. Some mods are a lot of fun like the ""Gunslinger mod"" which puts a cool skin on a lot of the Marine structures (One of my favorite parts of this mod is the shark-like-teeth now on the turrets). But they are not limited to aesthetics! I picked up a ""simple"" cross-hair mod that not only gave me a great new cross-hair

Here are some questions I have for the NS2 community:

- What mods do you use and would recommend to others??
- Do you think the mods to change the ""alien vision"" are almost like a hack in a bad way?
- I came across a mod that removed a lot of the ""noise"" in the Exo suit screen so you now have a clear view. Would you consider this fair or foul to have as a mod? Does it not even matter?
- If I download a gameplay mod (such as Combat or Forsaken) and want to play it locally or at a LAN. How do you start a local game with one of these mods without actually starting a server?


Here are some mods I use

**Aesthetic**

- ""Gunslinger Overhaul"" 
- ""e_X_m""   (Marine armor mod)
- ""e_X_m  Hands""
- ""e_X_m Spawn"" 
- ""e_X_w Holo rifle v2.0"" (looks cool and also frees up more of the screen)
- ""e_X_w Flamethrower""
- ""e_X_b  MAC""
- ""e_X_o""  (mod changing the exo's armor)
- ""Red Eclipse Phase Gate""
- ""Infestation Redux"" (This is the mod to make infestation glow!)


**Productivity**

- Any of ""Koruyo's Crosshairs""
- ""Mini-map Colored Players"": this mod makes aliens always red and marines always green on the map while leaving the marines structures the usual blue. This mod has many reasons why it helps me but one obvious one is being able to clearly see your marines as a commander (sometimes I will not see a marine in a room on the map because there are so many other marines structures there)
- ""Simple Waypoints &amp; Scan Circles""
- ""Transparent Map""
- The mod mentioned above that removes the extra onscreen crap from the Exo suit (still can't find the name of it though)

Edit: Another cool mod that I will have to find the exact name for made the alien infestation GLOW!

I don't pretend to be great at the game


- Do not disregard orders. If the commander says to go to ""X"" location

- Don't go out on your own

- Do not stand still

- One of the most important things in this game is resourses. The amount of RTs that your team holds determines how much personal res you have to spend on weapons

- As an alien you should prioritize RTs and other buildings over powernodes. A powernode can be built so fast and doesn't cost anything that it is a complete waste of time to destroy it in most circumstances. It is also a small structure

- Information is vital in this game and you should not withhold it. Especially if you're commanding! If you see e.g. 3 marines in ""X"" location setting up a phase gate you need to relay that information

- Do not ""overbuild"" in unsecured areas unless you are certain that you are safe. What I mean by that is that there shouldn't be 3 marines building an RT

- If you are new to commanding and don't know what you are doing then do not ignore what your team wants you to build. If someone says to build a second infantry portal (IP) in the beginning it's so you can survive a skulk rush and you should do it. If your team wants mines you should not ignore that request. Also if you don't have a mic... DON'T COMMAND! Seriously

- Mines are great at denying harassment by skulks at extractors and for shutting down vents, in some places you can jump and place them on the ceiling, place them at vents or just infront of a door. 

- You need to glance at your map (C by default) and do it often. For one you need to familiarize yourself with the maps

- As a marine don't stand right next to your other marine teammates. Give each other a little distance. It's much easier to shoot a skulk jumping around a teammate than around you! Bunched up marines also waste a lot of ammo accidentally shooting each other instead of the aliens as they don't have a clean line of fire.

If you didn't get a chance to sign up but still want to play please send me a message an inform me you would like to be a stand in

**About:** (Thanks to Rubix in advanced

After running the first tournament we really wanted to get bring some competitive action back to our reddit community so [C.H.U.D] (Liverpoop) and I (Old_Greg) have decided to organize a small in-house tournament for the reddit community before we open it up to the whole of the NS2 community.

**Event Info**

* This tournament will be played on [2nd of December (Sunday)](http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20121202T18&amp;p0=263&amp;msg=Reddit+In-house+Natural+Selection+2+Tournament)

* This tournament will take place in the NA servers

* Individuals who signup will be placed randomly on teams based on skill level in an attempt to create balanced teams

* Due to our limited servers and not wanting to go over 7 hours again like the last tournament

* You will be given 5 minute breaks inbetween rounds to go to the bathroom

* We will be using all of the NS2 maps except for Refinery (Consult www.ns2stats.org as to why)

* The bracket will be single elimination with every match being a Bo3.
Any single match that lasts longer than 30 minutes can be stopped by a referee if they feel one team has an insurmountable lead.

* The event starts at 6:00 PM EST ([Timer](http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20121202T18&amp;p0=263&amp;msg=Reddit+In-house+Natural+Selection+2+Tournament))

**Signups**

* To sign up
 * **Username
 * Skill levels are as follows:
  * Rookie: I just bought this game is it fun?
  * Average: I've played some pubs and have a basic understanding of the game.
  * Veteran: Do you even lift?!? I eat 6v6's for breakfast!
* We're limited on the number of teams by the number of commanders who sign up. So if you're willing and able to command but would rather just be a soldier




**Organizers**

* [Old_Greg](http://steamcommunity.com/id/solereavr/) (SourceIamA)

* [[C.H.U.D.]](http://steamcommunity.com/id/liverpoop/) (Liverpoop)

**Referees**

* **We are currently looking for referees

* [Zonkyslayer](http://steamcommunity.com/id/ponyxslayer)

**Casters**

* [SusanTD](http://www.twitch.tv/susantd)

* [Vindalo0](http://www.twitch.tv/vindalo0)

* [Talutha](http://www.twitch.tv/talutha)

**Servers**

* **If you have a server and would like to donate it for the duration of the tournament that would be much appreciated**

* Reddit.com/r/ns2
 * redditns2.com
* Funhouse (Thanks Rapey)
 * funhouse.ns2servers.com
* Lectr's Server
 * lectr.ns2servers.com

Note: to connect to an server manually open the console with the tilde key and type ""connect &lt;ip address&gt; &lt;password&gt;""

**Chat** (If this can't be used I'll find a replacement and update the thread)

* c4sh 'lft's Mumble Server
 * 74.86.55.132
 * Port: 64738
 * Join the ""Natural Selection 2"" channel when the event starts
 * Each team will have their own password protected channel
 * To join your channel go to Server&gt;Access Tokens&gt;Then add your commander's name in all lower-case
 * Do not attempt to enter another team's channel and do not give out your password to other teams
 * Be respectful of c4sh's wishes as he was nice enough to let us use his server
 * Download mumble [here](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/)

**Match Protocol** (Thanks Rubix

* Old_Greg (SourceIamA on reddit) will message each commander through Steam with the server they are assigned to.
* Each team's assigned server will also be added to the bottom of this post.
* Do not join a server if your team is not assigned to it!
* In Game
 * Both teams will join the server and stay in the ready room
Once both teams are on the server
 * The team that guesses closer to the referee's number will choose their starting race and map.
 * The referee will switch the server to the correct map.
 * Both teams will enter the game as their respective races.
 * When both commanders have typed ""Ready"" in chat
 * After that the loser of each round will choose the next map and the teams will switch races.
 * Note: You can choose to play the same map
 * When a team has won two matches the referee will message me with the score and both teams will leave the server.
 * New Rule: Temper tantrums, etc, is prohibited and a referee has the power to remove any player from the tournament if they break this rule. Smack talk is allowed if its in good competitive nature. Don't ask me to explain the difference, we are all mature enough to understand that saying ""How'd I get to be so good?"" is different from saying ""You're a (Insert offensive word here).""

**Dropouts and No-shows**

* If you are missing somebody from your team and have not heard from them by the time the tournament starts message Old_Greg on steam and I will get a replacement player for you.

* If you find that you cannot make it to the tournament for whatever reason message SourceIamA on Reddit ASAP (Or Old_Greg on steam).

* **Notes**
 * If you have any questions or comments please feel free to message me on reddit or on steam.

Just want to let you guys know there's a bad egg in the bunch of lovely NS2 servers on the master list.  If you guys come across this server:

**Victurus Online Gaming Guild - NS2 - Dallas** (IP Address: 74.63.253.115) and see an Admin named [Ecks (some clan tag in front)](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970721896)

My story: I was marine commander, but none of our marines can hit him because he was apparently in between walls (a known exploit).  Aliens team called him out as well, and we recognize he was one of the admins.  So we said we will report him - suddenly I was switched from Marine Commander to Aliens.  And guess who I see in Marine's comm chair? Ecks.  I told my old teammates how to eject him seeing as he's either trolling our team or taking over by admin abuse.  He got ejected shortly, and I told my team to hang tight as I won't be able to rejoin them (team unbalanced).  After that, guess what? I got kicked and banned.  Obvious, really.

Anyways, just a heads up.

I won't go into the nature of the exploit

Anyways

The reason I suggest this is because I see very little micro management in the games that I play. Everyone is just expected to know what to do which assumes too much from everyone.  

Freeing up some of the micromanagement to squad leaders can let the commander concentrate on other things and keep the team split into cohesive units.

This mod currently does nothing because there aren't any servers with the ""RS:"" tag in their name. So I need 2 things from the community:

If an onos stumbles upon 3-4 marines he will have no problem killing or retreating from them. An onos is much more forgiving of error given its extreme health, stealth, be completely silent, etc.

Meanwhile the 2x minigun Exo feel like crap in comparison. It's utterly dependent on multiple teammates to keep you repaired and unswarmed. If you make even a slight mistake, or be recalled ensures that against a smart alien team you will never be in the right place to make a difference. Unlike onos, I have never seen a dual-exo pilot turn the tide of a game. In chaotic multi-onos/multi-exo fights that decide games I have never, ever seen the exosuits win. The exosuits are forced to stay clumped for safety since the highly maneuverable onos will gladly pick off any solo exo's... but when they stay clumped they give the aliens a free pass to strike elsewhere on the map and when the big fight ultimately comes the Exos are often firing into each other's backs and have no way of determining which Onos to focus fire. Then bilebombs fall in and its hopeless for the exos with bile covering 80% of their screen and they are all being 3-shot. 

That doesn't even get into the issue of marines being extremely vulnerable to a surgical strike on their power/arms lab and having their exo's go from glass cannon to ""paper mache noodle"" and get shredded in seconds. 

I don't follow the competitive scene and I'm sure a well organized team of professional players have a difference kind of balance, because even if the marines have more resources at 20 minutes - multiple intelligent Onos are almost impossible to counter.",,False,self,t5_2rfpj,False,,

I've made some major changes to the ARS mod

This mod has been out for over a little over a week and only has 1 group of servers using the RS# tag (thanks TacticalGamer.com!). I suspect a large part of the problem is reaching server administrators. While there are many NS2 forums and even an NS2 server admin mailing list

Instead of giving up on this mod

This allows the mod to identify *many* more servers with reserved slots at a small cost: I have to personally maintain the database and between updates a server's database entry may become outdated. Most servers don't change their name or the number of reserved slots very often

It would be extremely helpful to me if you could report servers that are inaccurately id'ed by the mod. For example

You can also help by encouraging server admins to put the number of public slots (the number of players that can connect before the server kicks them to make sure players with a reserved slot can connect) in their motd and by encouraging admins to use the RS# tag.

I'm writing this because in 99, and next they build a phasegate at every single tech point, and believe then that they have ""map control"".
I'm here to tell you guys why this is a bad way to open as a marine commander.
You can skip this introduction if you want, I get flamed endlessly by my team mates during the match, which obviously lowers morale, and I get zero credit when we win and all the blame if we lose.
I never get a real chance to defend my opening

Here's the problem with phase tech. You first need an observatory (15 res)
80 res is the bare minimum you need to just get one phase gate connection. And this is assuming you're not going to lose any phase gates, this 80 res figure, is assuming you're not losing and need to replace any phase gates!

But here's the main issue. Those 80 res, which NON of it is spent towards pressuring the aliens.
And if you've seen or played competetive ns2

So here's the thing, but to make an assault. Because for that 80 res to have been anywhere near usefull, you absolutely have to cripple the aliens. You should really at least kill a hive with such a commitment.

So guys, if you use it correctly. Just don't use phase gates as defense, it's probably one of the weakest strategies in the game.

glad to see this here! having a hard time finding a game there are so many full servers. makes me SO HAPPY :-)

tips for new players:

1. ask questions! it can be really frustrating to spend forever trying to figure one simple thing out. no one is going to judge! especially this weekend. plus its better for the whole team if you are on the same page

2. check the map religiously. downloading a mod like this one helps a lot: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=118155096 because it helps highlight players and buildings. when you first start the maps are confusing as all hell

3. don't shoot the cysts. like seriously. it gives away your position, you are wasting your ammo and your time, which will quickly come to an end as an alien comes and chomps on your stupid butt. ok so reasons: 

a. you are trying to cut off buildings to make them die

b. you are trying to clear a room because you just took it

c. to deny the aliens being able to build something

d. you are mainly just defending a base, go ahead :-P

4. marines - THE GOLDEN RULE: USE THE BUDDY SYSTEM. if you don't, but it also is a good wait to spring traps prematurely and letting your squad clean everything up.

5. aliens - don't let the marines dictate the game. it is really tempting to challenge the marines setting up adjacent to your base directly, slip through and find an rt in the back, AWAY from the front lines. make them come and kill you. run away and hide when you hear them coming. make their lives miserable. the more thinned out you can make them, the better!

6. know what to chomp/shoot at! first off, shoot things that are worth resources. i'll give you a hint, this is USUALLY NOT THE POWER. yes it looks delicious, but rebuilding it is free. only go for the power if it has some tactical advantage like disabling a bunch of buildings, or you want to make sure they can't drop any buildings there quickly. the most common structure you will find opportunities to kill will be rt's/harvesters. these are good. cysts/power bad, rt/harvester good. if you have friends with you, don't attack till they get in position to do so as well. avoid giving yourselves away until you are ready. third, or run past them to safety before attacking other things. hydras and sentries might not seem very dangerous, and tell your team to too. hyrdas die much faster without their gorge.

7. If you find yourself in the opposing teams base
a. marines: go for the upgrades. always always the upgrades. these are shells, shoot gorge tunnels, crags, shifts, or shades. shooting the hive is tempting, but it has a lot of health and you have limited ammo/dps. chances are you won't be able to do it unless you have 4+ teammates with you, and ambush it together.
b. aliens: go for the observatory. even a couple skulks can force a comm to beacon if their obs is about to go down. if not the obs, and arms labs, whatever you can get your jaws on :-) also, it is key to focus fire on things. call out targets for the team if no one else is (even for aliens) as it is much better to kill one thing, than slightly damage five things.

8. pick a role and stick with it. the game will eventually settle into a sort of rhythm, but its usually good if people stay relatively consistent. some may be less glamours than others, but they are all EXTREMELY important. you will realize how much so when someone doesn't do one, and you lose. this list is by no means all inclusive, however. examples:

a. marines - base defense: its usually good to have at least a couple people at each tech point. once phase gates are up two or three people can bounce around between the gates

b. rt capper/defender: aliens are good at harassing rt's

c. welder: this used to only be important once exo's came out, in larger groups of marines having a dedicated welder is actually useful. constantly welding your teammates keeps them alive (even in a fight), and the welder can actually help kill skulks (or onos if you are a badass :-))

d. aliens- the roles for aliens are less fluid due to the fact the lifeforms themselves have their roles, and you WILL lose (unless you have ridiculously good people). find an rt between tech points, and munch it. when that's dead, do it again. wait just long enough for them to rebuild it and then munch it again. the more you can do it, the better.

9. my final one (for now, and are waiting for reinforcements to hoof it to your location because the phase when down, your goal is to stay alive as long as possible. period. killing things is great, but if you can run instead and stay alive long, that is better. you being alive focuses the aliens on you, and keeps them from killing your structures. every second you can buy helps. on the other end of the spectrum, however, don't think

**Aliens**  
  
  
  
  
  
As allen Khammander your first job is basically to Cyst the map and get as many harvesters up as possible (4 are enough). But that doesnt mean you should just recklessly throw a harvester on every res node you can find. Alien harvesters take alot of time to grow, it will be taken down almost certainly.  






After you got your team some ressource towers its time to think about the first hive upgrade. You have got 3 choices: crags





**-Shifthive:** In my opinion the best and safest choice for first hive in nearly all situations. Celerity will grant your skulks a great movement boost and allow them to be everywhere. Adrenaline isnt needed early game, he will be able to spam his healspray without hesitation, and finish your hive even faster.  



**-Shadehive:** In my opinion not a really good tech. I know many people love them, so camoflage wont make a big difference. Also camo will actually encourage bad marines to run in groups because theyre to afraid to walk alone, so you are teaching your enemy to play properly. Your skulks will die less, but move very slow and alien earlygame is all about harrassing extractors, killing marines and beeing everywhere. It doesnt really matter if skulks die more if they can pressure marines really hard. Also camo is only strong early game. So if you dont get 3 hives easily you are in trouble, because camo doesnt really help in mid/lategame. Silence if quite a good tech for bilebomb gorges, but wont help you in the beginning more then camo. Shades are pretty much useless in early game. You have nothing important to hide except of your upgrades, so its not even nearly as good as Shifts or Crags in the early stage of game.  



**Craghive:** The Craghive is an awesome one, but not as usefull as camo or celerity. There are situations where fast carapace makes sense, such as close position games, but it is very situational. Would not recomment a beginner to go for it. Crags are for aliens pretty much what armories are for Marines. They heal your Aliens and help to hold positions. Also you can put some Crags near growing hives to substitute a gorge. Ofc a gorge is better, because he is increasing the growing speed, but a Crag can atleast heal the hive up, so it wont be as vulnerable.  



After you decided and built your upgrade its time to safe ressources for second hive and get some more harvesters up. Like in the beginning you choose the safest place possible. Hives are pretty vulnerable when you build them. Here you should communicate with your team and tell them where you want to put your hive up. That help you evade situations like 1 marine taking it down while your team is attacking an extractor at the other side of the map. Losing a Hive worth 40 res is real trouble for your team and might lose you the game. Second hive upgrade is everytime a craghive



Also there is a possibility to get a fast third hive. If you see your team obliderating the marines and  you got a second safe position for a hive go for it! However this move might delay the upgrades for your team(it will almost certainly unless you have got mass ressources aswell), go for it. 3 Hives mean pretty much a won game, because you can drop Onos eggs.  



With the second hive you can research 4 more upgrades: leap, so the question in what order? This depends pretty much on your team. Watch what most of your teammates are playing. You have got 6 skulks? Go for leap first. You have got 3 lerks and 0 fades? Spores and blink later! Always try to research the upgrade your team benefit most from. In most cases leap and everything after makes sense.  



Your priority after a finished second hive is to get a third hive. Third hive grants the strongest abilities for Lerks



If your team cant conquer a third hive try to secure as many ressource points as you can. Mass ressources are often even more important as a third hive



*Well i think i mentioned the most important points



**-Whip rush:** If you cant break a marine turtle, because marines are wasting their time on destroying your cysts and whips and your team has enough time to destroy enemy power node. Use nutrient mist on cysts so they will spread infestation faster.



**-Cystspam:** If marines are trying to conquer a point



**-Drifters:** Everyone forgets about them



**-Jumping out of comm chair to fight with ur team:** A very good and viable tactic. Unlike marines, because people dont get it.  

**-Spawn camp emergency response:(thanks to flyscan)**

Here's how to respond in a pub game where early game marines get into your base and take out eggs while one of them attacks the hive. If you're not confident enough to take on marines as hero skulk in a 3v1 battle

Ensure you have resources. They will kill your resource node in the base. At the end of this battle you must have 18ish resource to cyst out and plant another resource tower. If there are already safe resource nodes outside your base things are looking good.

   *  Upgrade to a shift hive (15 res)

   * Place a shift outside of your main base (10 res + 1 res for each cyst to get you clear of base)

   * Click on the shift and purchase eggs (5 res each)

Baby skulks will be born

It's very much touch and go in this situation however if you've already researched shift hive


Holy shit

Overview of Evolution Branches:
---
**Shade/Veil Branch:** Stealth and Deception. This evolutionary tree is often seen as weak in pubs

* **Feint** - This evolution will automatically revive the player upon death and cause the player to become invisible for a short time. It will leave behind a body and a fake death indication. You have limited movement while invisible.

    *A second chance of sorts. You will know when feint has activated when a pink filter (just like Camouflage) covers your screen. Use this to run away or to go in for the kill when an enemy marine turns away from you. Extremely useful if you want to conserve an upper lifeform.*

* **Silence** - Exactly what the label says. This trait completely removes a player's sound signature. 

    *Hearing is half the battle. This is a good tool for almost any situation you think of

* **Camouflage** - Turns you invisible based on your movement. When the player is completely still
    
    *This has many applications. You can set up ambushes, as the player can observe enemy movement indefinitely. There's nothing more satisfying than letting a marine walk into your mouth. Beware of scans, as they will uncamouflage you and reveal you on Marine's maps*

**Shift/Spur Branch:** Has a focus on speed of movement and preparation. This branch is a common first-pick due to its widespread application.

* **Celerity:** After a few seconds of traveling in the same direction

     *A good general ability to have if you're indecisive. It's useful for responding to hive attacks, and even for running if you can avoid getting hit by bullets.*

* **Adrenaline:** Gives the player increased energy regeneration.

     *Very useful in and out of combat, it means they can lay down far more Spore and Umbra clouds before they run out of juice. Fades get a heavily increased benefit due to Blink's and Vortex's heavy energy usage.*

* **Hypermutation:** This is an upgrade that allows the player to switch classes on the fly

    *A bit of explanation: If a player evolves into a lerk, he will have only paid 30 personal resources in total, gestating for a fraction of the normal duration. The implications of this evolution are STAGGERING, and I am surprised that more people do not use it. Resource management and increased evolutionary speeds can make this trait essential for players playing support roles such as the gorge and lerk. And no slouch for others aiming for fast-response evolutions.*

**Crag/ Shell Branch:** While limited

* **Carapace:** Gives the player increased armor and decreased movespeed

    *As noted in the description

* **Regeneration:** After some time out of combat

     *Pretty much made for hit-and-run tactics or general front line shenanigans. Take this evolution for upper lifeforms to provide good survivability. Fades use this trait well.*

&gt;Ambusher and building killer. Never walk in a straight line and mostly stay off the floor

* The Skulk is able to walk on any surface, ceilings for attack vectors and general movement!

* You can also use jumps and wall jumping to gain speed boosts to close the distance. Stay clear of grenades and mines. Make use of obstructions to take cover from fire and learn your escape routes like vents and stuff to hide behind.

* Your main role is either to harras marine outposts like resnodes or forward bases (phase gate+armory), but the same holds true for them.

* When you have two hives

* When you attack with bite, which will reduce your damage output significantly. This holds true for all aliens.

* You can use parasite on marines and marine structures. This will make them show up on the alien Hive Sight (explained below). It does a very small amount of damage and could in rare circumstance be used to kill a marine on low health. Marines can remove the parasite by using medkits

**Gorge**
&gt;This creature is the healing and support class. You need to stay clear of marines or near other players that are using other classes. You can also help with speeding up construction of alien structures. A Gorge is usually safest on infestation or near hives.

* The Gorge has the ability to place mini-cysts that cost personal res and Hydras. You can help out the alien commander by spreading mini-cysts when the alien commander is lacking resources.

* Furthermore you can use Hydras to fend off marines to some extent. These structures shoot spikes

* Healing is very important for both structures as players. But makes sure you have enough energy to have emergency healing available. You will also heal yourself when using the healing ability. This can be useful when you are trying to get away from marines as it will reduce the damage done to you. Just make sure you get back to safety

* Your movement can be sped up by using shift on infestation. You will bellyslide in the direction your face.

* You can use spit to slow down marines and make their vision blurry to some extend. This comes in quite handy

* Last but not least you can gain the ability to lob bile bombs

**Lerk**
&gt;The lerk should be used from a distance with spikes

* When escaping you can use spores to cover your escape to some extend.

* Lerks when used in pairs can be devastating

* Other aliens can use your spores as well to take cover while attacking the marines. So when going in for a spore run

* The Lerk also has the ability to roost on walls ^[Shift ^when ^near ^walls] and attack from there using spikes. This can come in handy when spiking from the shadows over a great distance vs buildings and marines

**Fade**
&gt;The fade is a speciality hit and run/assault class that has a very potent attack. Marine lvl2 armor = 2 swipes

* The main movement of the fade is blink, so good marines could track you and predict your teleport location.

* The basic tactic of the Fade is to do hit and run waves. You blink in

* With the new addition of shadowstep and if you're confident enough you could stay near marines and harass them. Shadowstep doesn't cost any energy and makes you sidestep quickly into the direction your movement keys are pressed

* If your energy is back to around 100%

**Onos**
&gt;The Onos is the end game class and is supposed to be used as a chaos class. It can take a lot of damage

* The main tactic is to run in at top speed

* Your main goal is to soak up damage

* You can stun using either Gore (damage+stun on a single marine) or use stomp (right click attack) on multiple marines. Doesn't do damage.

* Stomp can also be used on structures to temporarily disable them. Very hand to delay re-spawning marines when used on Infantry portals or even Phase gates. And the Armory as well

**Heads up Display or Hive Sight and the mini-map**
&gt;The alien HUD or Hive Sight as it's called will show you all kinds of things around the map Ranging from parasited marines/structures

* You can coordinate with other aliens to attack certain areas
* When you see marines or marine structures
* Your team's infestation will show marines similar to when a marine is parasited. Keep an eye on the Hive Sight and mini-map ^[Default ^key ^C] to scout for marines.

**The general rule of thumb for aliens**

* Keep moving at all times, otherwise you will show up on motion tracking or the mini-map for marines, even when cloaked!

* Use alien vision when needed ^[Default ^key ^F]. You can see things when not using alien vision

**Questions/Suggestions**

* If you have questions or suggestions to add stuff

Now, and I'm hoping you friendly NS2'ers of reddit can help me with.

1. Marine play. I think I'm a pretty decent marine. When I can, I'd say I can win 50% of the time if I see him first, otherwise I'm dead. I also try my best to stay near some teammates. Marine deaths overall don't feel too frustrating until the aliens somehow pull of a 3+ onos rush on our base, at which I usually just F4 to avoid getting killfarmed. How on earth do aliens manage to sneak around that many resources? Most of the times this happens, I wonder how on earth they managed to get that much in the way of resources.

2. Alien play (Skulk). Wow. I SUCK at anything to do with aliens. As a skulk, only if he's alone. I've tried jumping around to avoid bullets, but that really only disorients me even further. How do you good skulks dodge marine bullets? I always seem to die almost instantly as a skulk.

3. Alien play (Gorge). I don't have much to say about gorge....I'm alright at it, I want you to go here"" when I gorge up early, even though I make a point of asking them where they want me.

4. Alien Play (Fade and Lerk). I figured I would combine these two, but I'm afraid to actually go lerk or fade because I don't want to die instantly and lose the res. I just wish someone could teach me how to use them effectively in person.

5. Alien Play (Onos). I'm a below average onos I would say. I tend to overcommit a bit too much

6. Commanding. I actually haven't tried commanding yet

7. Community. I've played on multiple servers now

I'm sure this will probably look like a massive wall of text by the time I actually post this. I really love NS2

In conclusion, not that the game is super unbalanced or anything like that. Any help you guys could give me would be very much appreciated as I continue trying to (slowly) get better at NS2.

*EDIT* Just thought I'd tag this on for some more feedback. What are you guys' thoughts on alien vision? Is it good to use regularly? Bad to use regularly? Only for if the power in a room just goes out? I'd love to know how you guys use it.

This was not written by me but by someone on the ns forum. Got reposted there in 2005 but i'm unable to find the original author. Anyway this is a great read.**

Must-know etiquette for being accepted on public servers

On the marine side...

Voicecomms: Never, building, commanding, welding, or jumping. By transmitting your futile bytes of useless information (examples: I'm in the hive, give me a pg now!/I need a weld, please), thus hindering their ability to rambo and rack up high scores. Every single sound that you make will cause fifteen cloaked skulks to spawn behind them
If it's a matter of real-life life or death
a) On a T3 connection
b) a natural English speaker
c) pronouncing every word and syllable perfectly without stuttering, or background noise.
If there are any imperfections whatsoever you will be instructed by the professionals to leave the server, buy a new accent, buy a new voice, or go and play on a 'german haxor server'.
If you need welding but you die, you are to blame if you don't call for the gate, since the commander has you all muted for obvious reasons.

Commanding:
The command chair is a somewhat important tool used by the marines to win or lose games. If you get into the commander chair for the first time, that will also be your fault. If you've never commanded for a national NS team, you must delete the command chair model from your NS directory, in case you accidentally face it while humping the armoury and get in. Even if you log out straight away and never touch it again, the next commander will blame everything that goes wrong in the following game on you. The loss will be put down to 'that nub idiot that got in the chair at the start'.

# If your commander dies for whatever reason during the game
# When commanding, even if they all split up. If you find this difficult try buying multiple monitors and find a way to break the birdseye view. This will enable you to medpack the marines that get parasited once and call for medical attention. Be sure to drop resource nodes at least 1 minute before the marines get there, otherwise you will be deemed 'slow and crap'. Make sure you pay especially close attention to the professional players, and make sure there are always at least 30 medpacks and ammo containers around them, in case they ever get bitten (which is your fault).
# If you plan to command a game, it is your fault for not dropping welders.
# Within 20 seconds you should have phase tech. Another 10 seconds you should have the majority of the upgrades from the armslab, 2 hives, and jetpacks.

Beme you sure to pay attention to the 42609872 medpack/order/ammo requests that take up all 512meg of your ram and crash your computer when a marine has to wait more than 2 seconds for your attention. As the delightful woman-ai-marine-commander-woman-girl will happily inform you, the marine will still be alive, and will be trying to knife a fade. He will die, and blafor lack of medpacks. Sometimes this alert will take you to a squad of 5 marines who are crouching in a cloud of poison gas. Make sure you med them every 0.5 seconds in case they go below 90hp.

If you build a turret factory anywhere, because they are obviously worthless and inferior to 7 marines that can't aim. At the same time, make sure you have at least one hive 'locked down' so that no aliens can take it over, which you must accomplish using neither mines (too expensive and get placed on your chair), or turrets, or indeed marines (they're all in double staring up at a vent that a lerk was in 9 minutes ago).

# If an onos appears
# If you lose any res nodes, this is your fault because you didn't tell anyone. However, you cannot electrify it because that makes you 'new'. Make sure you always have at least 500 resources, so that people can have a jetpack for the readyroom on the offchance that you win. If you lose, you will be flamed with added petrolium every time you even look at the comm chair on that server, so change your nick and hope to God that no-one got your steamid.

Playing a marine:
This is one of the easier roles to play, flame him, call and admin, and eject him. Tell him he's a 'cs nub olol' and he will surely take offence.

One thing you must be careful of, surrounded by 16 onoses with only a knife out, you will still have stolen his kills. However, if he dies it is your fault (and the fault of the commander). Stay well away, because if you block them, block their shots, or make any noise whatsoever
# Always go and find new res nodes to build. When you call for orders, comm will recycle base and blame you for the loss.
# Make sure you follow waypoints
# If you see a phase gate, if you see a phase gate you mustn't phase through, just in case there's another, more important gate going up elsewhere.
# You must be in base, and killing aliens, all at the same time. If you can't multitask to this extent, you are a useless cs player.

Come to realise that the comm screaming 'kill that fade omg 1 bar left WTH useless die argh recycling' means that you failed to kill the fade, 34 gorges, a hive, and the fact that you had no ammo - it is entirely your fault. If any teammates were there, they will also most likely blame you, for blocking them.

------------------------

**The Siege(Natural Selection)**

I was still fairly new to the game, as Tier 3 Alien Tech was nothing short of devastating against silly humanoids with their peashooters. Of course, I didn't know that. I just knew we were losing.

In our case, in which the winner would be fairly clear. After dying a few dozen times, I kind of gave up and made a little challenge to see if I can run past all the aliens and play hide-and-seek after the base was destroyed (the game didn't end until all players and structures on one team were dead). 

I found myself a little hiding spot in a vent

""What are you doing there?""

""Hiding.""

A phase gate template appears on the floor before me.

""Build that instead.""

And so, and my team pours out of the structure, busily preparing new buildings... right next to the alien hive! I slowly realized what was about to happen. 

Not long afterwards

We were finally all set. The Commander gave the instruction to invade the Hive Room, making the the coolest explosion sounds I'd ever heard in a video game. We entered the room and obliterated every last trace of Alien vermin we could see. It was over in less than a minute. 

The aliens had lost a Hive. Noting the loss of Tier 3 tech

------------------------

**The Ambush (Natural Selection)**

I had put in a fair amount of hours into the game at this point

This provided the Kharaa with some interesting evolutionary options

We did it anyway. We were pretty well organized for a pub, there would be at least 3-4 marines heading over to secure Cargo.

This time? The whole team. We watched in cloaked silence from the walls and ceilings as the marine team started building several structures

Since i picked up NS2 i'm constantly looking to get better and better at this game. Obviously the biggest room for improvement is on mastering alien Lifeforms
The one lifeform i cant seem to get good with is Fade. I know the basic movements thing like shadowstep =&gt; jump =&gt; jump. 
After watching some competitive casts i noticed that i'm really far from being as mobile and scary as those ninja fades in the hands of skilled players. 
Those fades seems so hard to hit
Do you guys know any good in-eyes or tutorial video about playing fade ?

Sorry for my average english !

I'm really curious to see what those of you who played NS1 religiously (you know who you are) think about NS2 and how it compares to the original. What do you like better? What do you miss about the original? Is it worth upgrading my PC for?

Favorite is tough but I'd say summit. I really like how crevice is a wide open beautiful graphics area that is fun to lerk camp out. I also like having 5 bases. I also like how there aren't fixed starting bases like you have to find it. Also the map is well made with a good variety of vents and res nodes and wide open enough for marines to have a fighting chance against the OP aliens in pub play (wide areas / longer hallways means onos' have to run further to reach the exos while the exos unload. This map usually leads to more strategy team play.



Whatever that map is called with sorting is a very very close second and at times I like it more. Honnestly while thinking about it now I prefer veil but I already typed out all that stuff about summit so I won't delete it haha. It is epic with same 5 base set up except also a big resources middle room. Variety of big room bases and small room bases - amazing. My favorite.

When i promised i would try to make a couple and see how it goes i didn't realized you can do this in american football

If there is any interest in this i would rather do it as interactive stream and maybe we can be on mumble and in game so that people can participate

-----------------------------------------

**Hero Gambit**

Reasoning behind this opening is you sacrifice one side of the map to push for important POI (Point Of Interest). On Veil that is definetly the double RT in Nano

Picture: [http://imgur.com/nvG61](http://imgur.com/nvG61)

1. GREEN: You need to pick a hero, maybe just a powernode. You leave one marine, builder, in base who builds armory and obs for you to research PGs. Rest of your team, fireteam charlie, goes to Topo, builds power and RT while 2 guys are on the watch at all times. You should have your hero spawning in base and second RT in Topo. Phase 1 complete

2. CYAN: Your builder and hero are now holding west entrance to your base and charlie is trying to safely get into east junction

3. BLUE: Build PG at home, IP and defend if needed), after acquiring Nano, sell PG in East (if used for push). 

Conclusion: You have nano

Alternative: You find Aliens starting in Pipes, hero can reinforce Nano trough West and after Nano you take Cargo/Sub or push Pipe hard.

All this is based on 6v6

-----------------------------------------

There is lot of ifs and buts, i have done it to see if there is any interest in these and to show some possibilities. Of course it will be very hard to coordinate at pubs, but i tried to make it simple enough so if there is any team communication it can be done hopefully.

Also my Marine Comm isn't that strong and this strat is mostly theory

Thank you for reading

----------

EDIT: I don't think i communicated the idea across right to you guys - this is just one possibility, lets call it opening. It's supposed to take care of the early game. I did this to see if it is possible and if you would like to see more or cooperate on building the actual playbook. It doesn't have to be original idea, you can analyze competitive game and see if that is anything translatable to lower skill levels.

So discussion should be if this format is OK, explainable and repeatable. Not really the overall strats and end goals for Veil. Please keep it on topic. Thank you",,False,self,t5_2rfpj,1358206858.0,skulk,

It was on docking. We had everything in our favor quite early (Cafeteria

They attacked us at an incredibly fast pace, etc. They killed our Exos at Generator while we were at Terminal repairing the damages of their last attack that forced us to beacon. They took Cafeteria, phase gate first, while we were at Departure expanding to Generator. They took Terminal as we finished defending and tried expanding (again) to Generator. Then they finished us at Departure from Generator. Add unsucceful (or maybe after all) attacks in between takes, and a Generator hive killed and regained, and you have a half of the match.

All of this was done by three Onos and two or three gorges. They had Celerity for sure, at a moment where they weren't super careful (i think they could have saved them all).

Even though i had *a lot* of fun playing this game (maybe the best game i've played yet) i would prefer beeing able to win in this situation.

Is there any way to beat multiple Onos healed by multiple Gorges ? We really got crushed by them and couldn't figure the situation out.

If either team cannot get beyond their first hive, would that be better overall for the game?

I want to propose more interactivity between the lifeforms.

Other lifeforms should be able to milk the Onos cows. 
Obviously the milk should at least at minimum be tradable with the humans. 
In return the Human Federation supplies the Kharaa with the finest baltic girls. What kind of perverted evolutionary breeding program the Kharaa are up to is not of your bussiness.
Everyone earns on a flourishing trade I say. The growing economy and improved understanding from the inter-racial activity will naturally lead to a world of peace

I have a few questions for you NS vets and betamongers. I used to play a lot of Q2:Gloom and the release of NS2 has made me excited about the prospect of having something similar but new so I've pre-ordered it. 

Now

If anyone is familiar with both games, balance, metagame) without playing yourself for a period of time.

The most obvious difference, which I find really fascinating. At the same time I dread its importance in more casual public play and I was hoping someone could shed light on the importance of that role.

The next thing I'm wondering about are the classes. I'm more into alien so I'm most curious about the potential of the early alien classes -- in gloom

Then there's the base building aspect. In gloom games would often progress to the dominant team building a forward base and offensive placing of ""defensive"" structures could be quite viable. Often teams would also try to hide spawns in faraway

And finally I would like to ask about maps. Many if not most gloom maps have both indoors and outdoors areas where the vertical dimension can play a big role

How to hide:
---

As one might guess

However

**Small Corridors/Rooms:** Marine eyesight will usually be drawn down the natural path of the hallway. Hide beyond the edge of normal peripheral vision

*Example: If a small hallway takes a right turn

[Shitty Diagram](http://i.imgur.com/vkAXA)

**Large Corridors/Rooms:** In these kinds of areas

Always be vigilant. Good marines will check their corners

---

How to track targets:
---

* **PARASITE EVERYTHING THAT MOVES (and doesn't).**

As covered in part 1

Now
Do you know what they call people who can see through walls? *Hackers.* It's cheating. 

You, it can also help you keep track of enemy structure placements.

* **Use vents whenever you can.**

Never reveal your presence to a Marine if you can help it. Using vents, faster than traveling normally as well.

* **Be quiet.**

In the same vein

---

How to ambush targets:
---

* **Attack from a point outside of the target's cone of vision.**

I've seen a lot of skulks die unfortunate deaths simply because they jumped directly into the barrel of a Marine's gun. Don't do it. The most favorable point is to attack from directly behind a Marine.

* **Plan an escape**

Sometimes, be sure to *get to the closest possible exit*. Time saved escaping is also time you're not getting shot at. As I said in Part 1; you are squishy.

[Another shitty diagram](http://i.imgur.com/ZlFj5)

* **Leap!**

All aliens become significantly more deadly when their alternate abilities are researched. Skulks are no exception. Leap can be used to close gaps between yourself and marines quickly, so even a dumb Marine can be alerted to your presence before you are able to start chomping away.

---

TL;DR
---
* When hiding in tight corridors
* Alternatively
* Parasite before you bite!
* Use the vents
* Be Quiet!
* Don't get in front of a Marine under any circumstance.
* Plan an escape.
* Use leap to close gaps and to dodge fire.

It was pretty late game (~45min in) and as Marine commander

As the push was going in to Cargo

Factors to consider:
- We had a few exos
- Beaconing would only grab those few marines
- The base was being attacked by lots of fades and lerks
- It was on the other side of the map
- We had a LOT of resources and all the upgrades (200 that I kept spamming on gifts to the troops).

If you were commanding

TL;DR: If one team does a push

What actually happened:
- While I dithered... we lost power just as I hit beacon and so I asked to continue the push. The push wasn't going anywhere after a whole minute

The flaw: 3 shifts plus spawning eggs is a real resource drain. Not enough extractors to drive this. The marines were contained though, the marines pushed and owned.

Marines' seige unit is now mobile and heavy armor is now a giant mech. They don't have a heavy machine gun, the locations where aliens drop hives are the same locations for commander chairs. Marines cannot weld shut vents currently.

Aliens have most of their original abilities.

Gorges can't web anymore and their bile bomb does stackable damage over time. They don't build chambers, as well as a ""clog"" which is a big nasty ball of crap that can stick to walls and other clogs blocking off areas from marines or allowing aliens to climb on them.

Skulks are almost identical to NS1

Lerks have their needles back from earlier versions of NS1. Their spore is not ranged

Fades don't metabolize, as well as buildings ceasing to function.

Onii have sadly lost the ability to devour marines. They still do everything else the same

The aliens have a commander now. He drops structures onto infestation that he's grown by placing a network of cysts. You can still only have on upgrade tree per hive, or scent of fear. You cannot teleport from hive to hive. The ""movement chamber"" of NS2 is the Shift and it has an additional ability to spawn eggs, which are spawn points for aliens. This allows alien commanders to control the flow of his team. The commander's version of the offense chamber is the Whip, which does short range damage to marines as well as deflecting grenades. The commander also has an NPC unit called a drifter which is a scout that he can move around the map and can release an enzyme which speeds the attack of aliens nearby. Finally, the commander can create a bone wall, which is a wall that rises from the ground to block the escape or pursuit of marines.

I think that covers it all. Hope to see you in-game!

With one with Vortex an exosuit can be easily killed.Simply vortex the exo and kill the welder.Even in large groups this is still viable.
2)The Arms lab 
One other thing you can have the fade do is before you all rush in to an unsuspecting marine base you can Vortex the arms lab leaving the marines easily killed when the rest of your team rushes in.
3) General annoyance 
As the fade your already a killing machine just simply vortex 1 marine in a group of 3 and that battle is in your favor. Also being able to take out any machinery for 5 seconds seems awesome to me.

A commander drops almost all of the building.  Gorges are basically only good for healing and bile bomb.  How is this fun?  I used to absolutely love playing gorge in NS1.  In NS2 I find myself bored and almost useless until the late game when i can heal an Onos...and cmon that isnt the most fun thing in NS2.  Follow an Onos around and hold mouse 2....

Gorges need more abilities or to be able to drop the regen structure or cloaking structure.  Truth be told I would want gorges to be able to run stuff like they did in NS1 when you can drop resource towers or hives but thats not gonna happen.  But atleast give us some more use.

Step 1) Go Lerk

Step 2) Get the commander to research regeneartion

Step 3) Go to Conduit and be an annoying ass because nobody can kill you up there over the pipes.

Step 4) Taunt twice every time you retreat up into the pipes.

Step 1) Go to Conduit

The Onos is the top tier for aliens and the flamethrower for the marines but that doesn't seem very even either.

now i searched all around the internet for solutions but nothing worked:
i tried making ns2.bat and starting it in high priority
i tried turning down all graphics
some people said it depended on the server you are on

This is the second of hopefully many threads to discuss things we have learned about the game recently. This could be a new strategy

Here are a few more things I've discovered in the past couple of weeks:

- Mine damage does NOT stack (thanks aSecretSin) 
- In addition to bile bomb, I dropped a CC blueprint in Cargo to see where the aliens were, and also deny an early hive drop. Low and behold, one gorge spit the blueprint until it disappeared, and I did not get any tres back :(
- If you attempt a shotgun rush, the CC blueprint might give the marines a little extra time to finish the hive)
- Another shotty rush strat I was a part of was this build order: Armory &gt; Shotguns &gt; Arms Lab &gt; Recycle the IP &gt; start Weapon 1 upgrade. When my team tried this
- An easy/fast way to determine the starting hive location is to drop a medpack on the other tech points. If there is a hive the health pack will stop on top of the hive
- You can easily get into a vent by yourself if you have mines. You can jump on mines that are placed on walls
- Apparently if you have silence
	
	

	
These were mentioned by others in the last post

- Opening the buy menu at an armory will heal you faster than just walking up to it
- When you build structures with a welder
(what percentage this is of the total build varies by building) and then switching to the normal build tool to finish it off.",self,t5_2rfpj,False,,gmarine,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/1g9o33/fascinating_fridays_are_back/

1353044216.0,13aal5,Anybody else bored because of the way aliens are balanced?,ProfessorFoo,26,13,97,"Right now it seems like Onos are pretty much required as it is and everything else besides skulks is mostly useless.  Gorges can't do anything against marines since spit/hydras are so terrible (especially hydras... my god those things are worthless) so they act basically as mobile healing spots for Onos and bombers against exos.  Lerks can make decent harassers/support but they are way too slow without celerity and they can't really get close to shotguns (which is 20 recoverable pres vs 30 nonrecoverable) to use half of their skills. Fades die to two well placed shot gun blasts so against marines that know what they're doing you should pretty much run from even 1 shotgun (and this is 50 pres we're talking about here...).  Of course exos can kill them even faster.  

IMO they should do something like lower lerk pres cost to 20 and increase lerk speed to celerity levels normally (so adrenaline is a better option), buff hydras a bunch (damage + health, maybe raise/remove the limit) and spit a little (maybe faster and less energy?), and reduce onos health/raise onos cost.  Also I'd like to see umbra more often... maybe it could just require 2 hives and spores?  

Anybody else feel this way?  It seems like the only way to do anything past early game is to make sure you always have an Onos as a distraction since everything else is so pathetically squishy.  I'm getting sick to death of Onos being everywhere. It's a good thing the NS2 classic mod is coming along so well to give us back the good old lerk/fade/gorge.

What about going Shade first?  I'd love to put off the 2nd hive and hide my 1st hive with a shade to really confusing aggressive marines.  The evolution options aren't bad either with silence and feign death.  Can you imagine a very early feign death skulk?  That would throw marines for a loop for awhile.  Right?

What do you guys think?  And as a secondary discussion here... I'd like to hear opinions on going fast hive.  It seems so risky and you don't have any evolutions to help your skulks out in defending that hive.  Would you rather have the 2 hives or grow more slowly with evolutions?
