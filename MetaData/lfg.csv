All right, or having enough people but no DM? Did you ever wish you could stop reading these kick-ass books and painting these cool minis and just fucking play? 


Then listen up.


I'm basically a newbie in the whole D&amp;D world, but recently I've been looking to play Pathfinder.


BUT:

The closest place to play Pathfinder is 30 minutes away, or there just not being anyone to DM for a table. I've tried everything, on and off, for the last 6 years: online play, kidnapping strangers and begging coworkers, Play by Post, everything. No dice (hurr puns hurr). 


Needless to say, or it may not fit your schedule, or blah blah blah.


So here is my solution for all of you, and we play ourselves some motherfucking D&amp;D (or whatever you're into).


This may be a terrible idea. It may result in rage and tears and hurt feelings and sessions on Oprah (oh wait never mind). But honestly


**Hypothetical FAQ:**


**What's your background in gaming? How are you the guy to head this up?**

You know what, I don't know anything about DMing other than it seems no-one wants to do it, and I don't even own my own dice. Strictly speaking, if you think you're going to message me or get in touch with me and find a guru of online gaming who will supply you with an automatic cure for your gaming drought, I'm here to disappoint.


**If you aren't the person to be heading this up

Because no one else is. That's why.


**Hey! I don't play Pathfinder! How come you said all games available when you're only talking about one?**

Hello. You are now in charge of learning how to DM your game. You're welcome.


**I'd really much rather play. Is there a chance I can join and not really worry about the whole learning to DM thing?**

*Sigh.* You know what? I'll take it. Hell


**Why should I respond to this message? What do I get out of joining you?**

A fuckload of work and maybe some gaming in between, welcome aboard. As for how this is going to work, I imagine it will go along the following pattern: 4 people get together, none of them know hardly anything about Pathfinder (for example). They run some encounters, die horribly, and slowly get better. 


**It seems like having all these different games will confuse the hell out of things. Wouldn't it be better if you made a separate post for each game?**

If you want to do it that way


**Wouldn't this be easier if we had someone with experience help us all learn?**

If we could find someone more experienced, they're more than welcome to. But I see a lot of newbies wanting to get into the game, and not a lot of experienced people around to make that happen. We can all read. Let's break open these books and start playing, instead of just waiting for someone to come around who may or may not have all the answers.


**I don't want to scroll through the comments and find someone to learn with!**

Well, not a question. However, At the top of this post I will be making a list of the redditors who are involved in this....whatever it is....and have them organized according to game.


**I don't want to play online

An option. You still want to find that magical group? Go ahead. I'd be there already if I could figure out how to do it. The things we learn here will (hopefully) transfer to offline play as well

**I know nothing about (game). Am I welcome here?**

Absolutely. You're the person we want here most. For some reason

The reality is that, you have to learn about stats, and feats, and skills, and all this other crap, before you can even hope to be remotely competent. You may have been told that in order to play, you have to read all 500 pages of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook (you laugh

Then you have to deal with the frustration of trying to find someone or somewhere to game. Maybe all of this is just too much waiting. Maybe you just want to *play*. 

For better or worse


**Who's us? Is this just you?**

As of making this post


**How do I sign up?**

Now you're talking. Just reply to this thread with a short message of what you would like to accomplish and which game you want to learn. ",,t5_2rcvr,1365211989.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/1bbwt0/online_dm_trainees_in_need_of_teachers_students/

As a DM you get everything you need to run a campaign, tools for running the game online, and a forum where you can consult with the other DMs or talk to our community.

As mentioned

During games we use two IRC rooms, actions, and descriptions. Character sheets are stored on our own server in a local copy of 3EProfiler, and we use a program called [Maptool](http://www.rptools.net/index.php?page=maptool) for battle maps.

I don't mind if it's 4th edition rules or whatever. PM me.

**EDIT**:
I used to play in an online group with a forum. I was under the impression that playing via forum posts was a pretty common thing

Well... if we can get enough people into it

The way it worked when I played via forum was that there was a thread for each character sheet

Dice rolls were done by the DM

The biggest thing was that we had one big long ""adventure thread"". It was here that the DM would describe the situation and we would post our attempted actions. You kind of were expected to post your actions in a descriptive

So I might attack a zombie and I would write:

""As my foot touches the sandy ground from the last attack I turn my eyes onto the final zombie. Using the momentum from that last devestating swing I let the sword cut through the air

And the DM might reply with: ""NeomerArcana's gamble doesn't pay off

To make it quick

Usually the DM would set a time limit based on his own real life circumstances. So he might say

Let me know if you're interested

**EDIT** the second:
After your descriptive text
""Move to G5 and attack zombie with greatsword""

The DM would also post a picture from a map program or spreadsheet or photoshop file (whatever) of the current position of people.

**Edit in the third degree**

So it looks like there's enough people. I'll get a board set up as best I can and we can go from there. I've decided to act as DM

I'm more than happy to allow other games to take place in my board

I'm good for 3.0 or 3.5 but if you want to use 4th edition I'll need a link to torrent.

Fresh GM looking to run the Only War system in a play by post fashion. While I'd love to run games in a live setting, develop homebrew rules to make the game more enjoyable and run more smoothly. I know a lot of players playing live use the maptool system which I am totally unfamiliar with. But I'd like to use roll20 for this, and being a PbP game, it shouldn't be at too much of a disadvantage.

I'm looking for 2-4 players planning to start in a couple weeks or so. New players are welcome as I will be new to this as well. I plan on just starting with one of the introductory adventures with pregenerated characters since this is meant to be more of a one-off adventures to test the system You don't need to have the rulebook with you as basic gameplay can be explained as we go

My thoughts are to use the virtual tabletop for chat logging important character actions, encounters, and maps drawn on the fly. Campaign discussion forum will be used for player actions and ooc inquiries. All the details aren't hammered out yet, but I'm open to suggestions. I don't know what if there's a timeout to the virtual tabletop, but I was also thinking about leaving players on a ""editing page"" while I'm not joined for those who need to access their character sheets, make rolls, look at a new map or handout (things that would also be made available offline).

I'm looking forward to expanding in the future into longer campaigns. There's a lot to explore as an Imperial Guardsman =)

I've been itching for some pen and paper

I am happy have a shot at playing DM (Though I have only played DM for a dozen or so times in an offline game with friends) so players may have to bear with me while I get used to everything! Though if there's a more experienced DM that would like to play I'd be happy with that also. I have experience with Maptools so would likely use that

Would anyone be interested in playing this older game? We could run through a few of the adventures to see how things went and go from there! I'm usually busy during the week but I could happily do a Sat or Sunday game from around lunchtime. Looking for either weekly for fortnightly depending on how busy everyone is.

I like a nice balance of combat and roleplay. I also prefer using text for roleplay (In my experience this helps players stay in character more) and using voice for combat to speed things up. Though voice for both wouldn't bother me either.

Would anyone be interested in trying to get something going? If I get enough interest I will look in to this more seriously.

This is not like that.

Shards of the Apocalypse (SotA) fits into three generas here. Post Apocalypse, but there you have it.

This game uses Fallout I's SPECIAL system for character creation, but that's about the only modification I've made. There are several different races to choose from at character creation, and race does have *some* impact on gameplay, but not overly much.

Hello
This would be an initially no-magic campaign with a little homebrew to fix healing &amp; skill issues. The world resembles actual medieval society and is fairly realistic. I reward clever players with bonuses on rolls or not even needing rolls depending on the situation. (If the player gives an amazing speech but rolls a 1 on diplomacy

The campaign will require solid role playing skills

Here are some links to help get an idea of the gameworld and the minor homebrew changes I have made.

The USS Horizon is a Saber classs vessel that is just starting her journey.

The year is 2382. The Federation and Starfleet have renewed their commitment to exploration. With recent losses to the Borg, Starfleet is in need of men, women and beings with the resolve necessary stand up for Federation ideals and defend it against all enemies.

Starfleet has tasked the Saber class USS Horizon with a four month mission to explore a region of space adjacent to the Tzenkethi, chart this unde-rexplored sector and show the flag when necessary to do so.

There will be few allies in this politically volatile region. The Federation border is an entire sector away - through Tzenkethi space. Although a nearby Bajoran colony may be relied upon in times of dire need

**~[Ancra Caligo Campaign Poster](http://i.picpar.com/gqo.jpg)~**

Hello! I'm a fairly experienced GM interested in running an **online campaign of exploration, and high-flying adventure, with a healthy dash of city-building and just a pinch of economics**.

I'm in the EST time zone

The system is D&amp;D 3.5

---

The setting is called *Ancra Caligo*, vibrant jungle basins below are filled with saurian fauna that would put Jurassic Park to shame. The secluded corners of the world (and everything above the canyon peaks) are suffused with the Mists: an otherworldly, ethereal fog that is both the greatest mystery of the world, and its greatest source of power.

Anyone can offer almost anything to the mists, to a pistol that was used to start a war. The offering fades into the mists for a moment, then is returned; if the gift was somehow worthy, the item, and the person who offered it, is marked by the mists with glowing, silvery designs. These mist marks unlock some aspect of the mists' reality-editing power for their bearer. Indeed, etc.) is gained, if any

The sapient races of the world (Bolds, Grays, and Quills) live in cosmopolitan, rapidly-industrializing cities, carved into canyon walls, spanning between the narrower canyons with massive suspension bridges, and linked together by magically-anchored skyrail tracks. Zip-lines and personal gliders are as common a method of inner-city travel as walkways and roads, while others manage colonies of giant

This is an era of opportunity for inventors, entrepreneurs, and explorers, just as it is for would-be skyrail robbers, airship pirates, crime syndicates, and robber barons. There are wrongs to be righted, and hypotheses to be tested! How will you change the world?

---

The campaign itself will depend very much on the direction(s) the players decide to take it. I intend for a large part of the game to be playable on a post-by-post basis

The campaign will start in and around the cliff city of Silkspan, the focus of your adventures can certainly expand beyond it. Those who are interested will have opportunities to build their own businesses, political groups, etc. Engineering new technologies out of the wonders and magic you discover along the way is highly encouraged.

I'm not sure how many players I want, feel free to post a comment below! :D

I've played on VTT's before, don't care for ""dungeon crawling"" or loot-mongering

I've just finished creating a setting that I want to start using for the next few years in both extended campaigns and one-shots.  It includes some custom rules and skill substitutions that I'm using in order to move away from grid-based combat.  Drawing maps requires a lot of preparation that I don't care for, the house rules, and the ""fun"" potential of my setting.

The feel of the campaign is grim and gritty - not grimdark.  I'm basically going for a mix between Game of Thrones (yes

Part of the reason I want to switch to Savage Worlds is to have the ability to kill characters without worrying about having to spend 5 hours making a new one.  I won't be looking for reasons to kill you

The full nature of the plot will depend on the characters the players create, even in a one-shot.

The story so far:

Telantha was the last known surviving city after a cataclysmic event that occurred 22 years ago

With this darkness came horrific demons-- manifestations of the creatures that used to inhabit the world. It took all the effort of Telantha's militia

Despite these efforts

Eventually, the military agreed, but there was a condition: The villagers would all be drafted into the military and are required to contribute to the safety and operation of Aden's Well.

Decide how you will contribute-- will you be a soldier, desperately using whatever materials you can salvage to keep the military supplied? There are many possibilities. Whatever you choose, your character is a part of something bigger, and their contributions can help the citizens of Aden's Well survive--- and perhaps even reclaim what was lost.

I hope you are as inspired by reading about each of these campaigns as I have been by creating them.  I would be equally interested in running any of the three campaigns

Please respond here or via PM if you are interested in one or more of the campaigns.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Let's make legends together!

We are currently 4 players of a starcraft II Clan looking to play some Pathfinder P&amp;P. We have created our characters already to the best of our abilities (which definitly need a lookover by some experienced player) and want to play some Role Play now!

As we are all german players in a german clan and very new to the game (some have no P&amp;P Experience whatsoever)

We plan to play every Wednesday from 7pm CEST till 11/12pm + additional optinal days if everyone has time.

Our goal is to get used to RP and Pathfinder to eventually experience a great campaign over the course of a long time - with you!

As we are new to the game i guess that you should not be new

Again: As we are all german players

As I have only used roll20.net until now i would suggest using this

We have one request though:
We want to be able to experience freely with our imagination and not move avatars in roll20.net from hex to hex all the time. It is totally fine and enough if you draw us a quick map paint-style! So please do this campaing and everything with as much free and imaginative as possible! :)

If you are interessted just leave a way to contact you here. We are starting this wednesday 19-6-13.

Hope to find a good DM who wants to have a nice group for roleplaying :)

I'm the only player in my current offline group that is currently willing to DM, I've had to design a lot of NPCs, which piqued my desire to create characters. I love making characters, but my favorite ones are aligned against the PCs and don't tend to last long enough to make a big impression.

I can't take it any more. I want to make a character and I want to play as it. Sure, dangling plot hooks, dastardly villains, and damsels in distress, but I'm getting burnt out. I want to be the hero again. I want to marvel at the mysteries of a new quest, to question the motives of a shifty NPC, to cut a man to pieces without worrying about the feelings of the player controlling it. Know what I mean?

Ideally

I've been running D&amp;D and CoC for years and have played in addition: Pathfinder, but it's still a learning process. Ascension levels and the extended rules books - while not enigmas - require some referencing. Also open to RT, but I know next to squat about that system- so perhaps it could be a slow transition later on.

The games I run are usually run heavy on RP in the mix of RP vs Combat, more concerned with creating a cool story around your characters than pitting you against a rule system.

**About You**
Two things I'm looking for are willingness to commit to consistent weekly meeting time and some kick ass characters. Rather than going on who goes first

Once I've committed I'll be there

Ideal players should be active posters willing to post at minimum once a day. Obviously we're not going to kick people out for missing a day but my point is I'm looking for people that are going to be active and engaged more often then not.

As GM I am central US time based but nocturnal and generally will be posting in the evenings and early mornings. Real time skype voice sessions might be held in the future to expedite things if we can find a time that works for most people but I'm not looking for a fixed schedule for that.

Basic premise for the game is the players will be serving a very young Rogue Trader dynasty. The elderly rogue trader currently officially in charge fo the dynasty has devoted themselves to hunting pirates and other enemies of the imperium. This has left them with a great reputation for honor but no real wealth. The basic theme will be grappling between the demands of honor and duty against the need and desire for material wealth.

So far i've got 3 interested, and someone undecided. This is still the formative stages so at the very earliest we'll start discussing out of character and making characters sometime next week. Post here or PM me if you are interested.

Update Edit: The current count of interested stands at 7 with Seneshal, and Astropath expressed interest. We can duplicate up on classes if folks want I don't see a problem with that. I will also state that interest alone doesn't guarantee a spot as I'm going to make people put together a fairly decent backstory to get in to kind of prove to me that your willing to put in the effort to actually stay with the game. Hate to be a jerk like that but it seems necissary to guarantee the long term health of the game.

Update Edit: If you've expressed interest but havn't gotten me your skype accoutn you need to do so as we're about approaching the cap. If you've gotten me your skype info and i havn't contacted you or added you t the chatroom please ping me here or there.

The game would be very open to player input on story direction and setting. I have a very barebones concept for the setting

Anyone interested?

EDIT: I guess so!

First

You definitely don't need to get the book to play though. Instead

I think it might be possible to play this with its own subreddit for play-by-post. I think it's at least something worth giving a try. Something to keep in mind for the game is that each Class is unique. There's only one Wizard or Fighter in the world. To paraphrase the book

So

**NEWEST EDIT**
I think I'm going to call it a day on recruiting at this point then to see where we're at. 

Well it looks like I've got a good list of players:
Befriendswbob
kellkore
Callmewolverine Paladin or Rogue
thedark1owns
robdizzledeets

Let me know what classes you might be interested in playing. The eight classes for Dungeon World (DW) are: Bard, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger, Thief, and Wizard. Again, each class is unique, if we don't end up with either a fighter or a paladin

I'd like to take discussion with the five of you to talk about the game more in-depth somewhere else so I don't just keep editing this post. What we could do is go to rpg.net at their [roleplay-by-post forums](http://forum.rpg.net/forumdisplay.php?31-In-Character-and-Out-of-Character-Threads).

I am planning on running a Savage Worlds campaign on roll20 on Thursday evenings ~8:00 or 9:00 PM EST (Starting November 1st). I will be using Skype instead of roll20's voice chat, from the Weird Wars series. In a nutshell, it will be Vietnam War meets weird shit going on (think Call of Cthulhu). The flavor text from the sourcebook is:

""Our first follow-up to our smash hit Weird Wars in the new Savage Worlds system takes us to the jungles of Vietnam. Your grunt has 365 days and a wake-up to learn what really lurks in the jungle. Surviving is tough enough, a ton of Edges &amp; Hindrances, new horrors, and an awesome Adventure Generator and Plot Points to tell the most savage of tales! Written by the mysterious Teller!""

Good Afternoon [r/lfg](http://www.reddit.com/r/lfg)

I'm starting a Dark Sun campaign this Sunday 09/09 and am looking for one to two more players to join the group. Here's some basic information:

* Time: Every other Sunday from 3 PM to 7 PM CST
* Where: roll20
* Setting: Dark Sun
* Starting Level: 2
* Allowed Material: All material is allowed so long as it fits the setting and your character background. I'm all for optimizing your character but I'm not a fan of cheesy builds and may retroactively decide to disallow material if something sneaks past me. I'm relatively new to 4e and haven't DMd in years so I ask for your patience :).
* Style: I like to balance roleplaying

The first adventure will be focused around one of the merchant houses in need of the assistance of a mighty group of adventurers. If you aren't familiar with the Dark Sun campaign setting I suggest either finding the source book and/or reading [these informative and entertaining blog posts](http://community.wizards.com/alphastream1/blog/2010/05/24/traveling_the_athasian_wastes).

(This is the second time around for me since people started to not communicate what was happening and which is why rule 3 is very important).

1. You do not need any experience to play in the group. I am more than happy to teach anyone the basics in a non-boring way. Be aware that 4e is a rule intensive game so I would suggest reading up between sessions and really knowing your character so combat goes quickly.

2. Roleplaying &gt; Rules all of the time. I am a rules lawyer when it comes to 4e but if someone wants to do something cool or interesting that isn't ""by the rules""

3. MOST IMPORTANT: If you post here, that you are busy that night.                                                                                                                                                                This does not mean that you can't go to your grandma's funeral, your brother's birthday or even hang out with some friends once in awhile. Hell you can miss 1/2 the games but it is fine as long as you tell us in advance. Just be aware that there are 5 other real people who want to game, so if you promise to be there and skip out, you are ruining the time for other people. Again, you do not need to be anti-social, just be communicative and understanding with us.

4. We will be playing on roll20 to play the game. You can go [here](http://roll20.net/) to figure out more.

I would like to get started again with a group of preferably 3-5 players for a once a week session over Skype.

I play in a homebrew world so anyone interested would need a little bit of a primer from me before creating any characters. Among the things my campaign has are:

* Slavic/Teutonic hybrid human culture on a religious Crusade.
* Druidic tree worshiping orcs.
* A Dwarven kingdom full of Tibetan style Lamasaries. 
* Persian style and mercantile human culture.
* [Maroon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroon_%28people%29) wild elves living in a giant forest.
* Turkish/Mongol hybrid Goblinoid and Ogric hordes.
* Indian cultured humans of an advanced but waning civilization.

I've been playing evolving this world for a bit over 5 years so I'm familiar with a good portion of it. Although it's not so set in stone that certain things can't be altered. 

I'd prefer newer or inexperienced players as that is who I'm used to

More specifically, and who is socially competent. None of us have extreme roleplaying backgrounds so you don't have to either, but that does not mean that we don't place heavy emphasis on it. To expand upon my first point, it is crucial that any would-be player is able to have fun via their own imagination. This is absolutely not a railroad campaign, and as such it does not present as much pre-packaged fun. While I will do my best to provide plenty of hooks, you must still seek out what interests you on your own while at the same time being able to accept and participate in group decisions on the direction of the game.

In most places, the mundane is a perfect analogue to the Supernal in this regard. And, yet, Mages flock there.

There are beautiful, worst of all, most of these buildings are abandoned.

One hundred years ago, technicians, doctors, lawyers, and so on. But the people that live in Troy now (in those few buildings which have not been abandoned yet) are welfare recipients, hookers, drug dealers, even
Truly

**Theme: Abdication**

Everyone has those moments of contemplation where they convince themselves that they were here to do Something Important, the world would simply not be the same. This is true, at least for those souls that have Awakened, and they try to act on it. But then they get mugged, and hand over the package they were tasked with delivering instead of fighting for it; they walk into a bar and get drunk instead of using their Magic to spring their buddy from jail for fear of legal consequences; they reveal information that must not be spoken for a few quick brownie points. Most Mages who behave this way try to justify it on humility, on ""knowing their place"", and on Wisdom, too scared

**Mood: Pettiness and Grime**

Mages here aren't just disinclined to make themselves great for various reasons. They're also concerned that someone might pick things up where they left off. Being one-upped is a hit to the ego, boring and conservative and yet they want to be treated like and regarded as rock stars by the people they meet. They want their cake and they want to eat it, too. When someone starts shining and showing off the results of their Supernal overtime, these people start scheming to take that person down.

**Joining the game**
Send me a private message with your character idea, I'm going to ask that you simply be creative. Send me a blurb about your character's concept, write a one hundred word story about him, draw a picture, write a blurb about his personality, whatever.

1373847349.0,1ib1bg,[Online] Looking for players for a FATE based cyberpunk game on Sundays.,Monagan,8,1,5,"**//edit 2:** For now

Hey there /r/lfg
  
A couple of friends and I are setting up a game based on FATE Core, see how the chemistry within the group is and, if all goes well, continue on a bi-weekly basis after that.  
   
As far as mechanics go, but don't worry about that too much for now - since our mechanics are also slightly altered we can go over all of that once we actually get down to making the character sheets.  
   
For now, personality, appearance and if applicable special powers (mutation powers as explained below, implants, etc). The two other players will be playing a rogueish, fast talking mutated hacker from the slums and an empathic spiritual healer / new age priest from the wilderness - if that affects your choice of character. If you also want to add a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for in a game, I'll gladly take that into account as well.    
  
If you have any open questions go ahead and ask
  
**Now
  
About 100 years in the future, as Earth is hit by a cataclysmic event. I'll stay scarce on the details, but needless to say it kills off a large portion of the human population. Australia basically becomes a complete hell, and the rest of the world isn't much better off, with strange phenomena and widespread destruction.   
  
The game will be set in the remains of the United States, run not by a democratic central government but by an alliance of corporations. You will find yourself in one of those cities.    
  
One of the major effects of the Event was the emerging of what appears to be magical powers - a mutation that enables abilities ranging from tele- or pyrokinesis to superhuman speed, through an unfortunate side effect, immediately turned psychotic, attacking those unaffected before withdrawing into the now mostly empty wilderness between the cities. Later on, other humans within the city started exhibiting those powers as well, but managed to maintain their sanity at first.  
  
However, the unaffected population is generally hostile or at least weary towards the Mutants (which aren't recognized as Mutant just from their appearance alone), and the corporation run local governments are starting to implement more and more drastic measures to contain the threat, leading to resistance and even insurgency from the mutated (but still sane) population.  
  
That's about all you have to know about the setting for now - you'll get the more detailed version as we go along, I'll be answering as fast as I can.

As a primer

I've been a DM now for about 5 years, roleplaying, but that's not to say I don't make combat happen/interesting. Granted, the first couple go arounds of BC combat I'm sure I'll mess something up, so be prepared for a fast &amp; loose interpretation of the rules. 

That all being said

* I will only be taking **4** players. Do not be discouraged if I've talked to more than 4 people
* The main game will be run through **roll20 and Skype.** The in-between fluff RP will be run through **Skype and a Subreddit**

***Currently hashing out details

Hey folks, but I'm equally willing to play one of the previous editions, or switch to SR5 when it drops if the group is headed in that direction. Pink Mohawk, grimdark, Gibsonrun, standard Shadowrun--I'm down for pretty much anything!

**What I offer:**

Chummer, and always polite, I can be the very definition of stealthy and professional. You want a mage? I'll cackle with glee and toss stunbolts galore when you need them. Street sammy? That mage won't even know what geeked 'im. Hacker/Technomancer? I'll see you guys after the run, try not to scratch the paint on the drones, mmkay? Face? I'll be charming, conniving, and diplomatic. Or at least I'll try.

What's more, complete with mannerisms and backstory. That's right--the only muderhobo you'll get from me is a murderhobo you ask for. 


**What I'm looking for:**

Pretty much anything that says SHADOWRUN on the tin, Skype, et al, although I may have to set up an account for some services before I can give you a username. Time and day of game are also pretty flexible, as well.

If you're accepted in

Their heroic tier started out with the characters being thrown together by fate and were never given the opportunity to separate until part way through and decided to stick together to survive; despite the setting taking place 100ish years after the apocalypse

If we can, like I said, we're very laid back.

Also, and our most recent casualty is our Bard. We homebrew combat to be on the easier side (though not too much more than 4E already is), so this, just like the prior experience, isn't a requirement, simply a plus.

Lastly, so we understand everyone's time needs and try to be flexible to everyone. This has worked well so far, but it often causes our pace to slow down. We usually meet weekly, but will often have to take a week off every month for one reason or another.

As I said, while Group 2 is more of a Lawful Good/Neutral group. I'm desperately waiting to see what happens when their plotlines start butting heads. I run my campaigns more along the story driven side; I'm a big fan of ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" style games in general and I like to be able to truly have choice and consequence in a way not possible in video games today.

Starting a new homebrew campaign and looking for 3-4 dedicated players, starting next friday the 20th of July. We will use Skype for VoIP, and either Rolld20 or Maptools for gameplay.

Start at level 7, 8, and 3000 gold. Can downgrade magic items for a lower level. One free Expertise feat.

*Chaos is a ladder.*

*Many who try to climb it fail

*And some are given the chance to climb, or Love.*

*Illusions. Only the Ladder is real.*

*The Climb is all there is.*""

           - Petyr Baelish


I am excited to introduce **Southron Ambitions**


The premise of the game we want to run explores from this perspective. The consequences of great romances, or be a casualty of it. If you are new to role-playing, play-by-post, or the *A Song of Ice and Fire* setting, or system, you are more than welcome to invite yourself in and take part regardless.


The setting we have built uses an equal part based on the Chronicle Starter and custom work by the GM.


*So how does this work?*


The ""chronicle"" will be organized into individual ""stories"", depending on their scope, and in between some downtime is given for further story and development, through events, decisions, and scenes done independently of those stories as the Houses march through the wheel of fate.


A story will contain the bulk of the role-playing, keeping the game moving at a decent pace while also providing for people of different schedules and time zones to interact. The current story is ""Summer 281 AL: A Tourney at Harrenhal"", our first story and opening game for the ***Southron Ambitions*** chronicle. If it's a success, we plan on it extending much further, so long as the interest remains.


#*So how do you join?*


You can create any number of accounts you like


Joining though is quite simple. Once you feel comfortable with the setting and rules, via the e-mail juvenalian.satyr@gmail.com. Alternatively, if you'd like to take a concept already baked into the setting and perhaps are not entirely comfortable with the character creation yet, you can pick one of the [Pre-Generated Characters](http://southronambitions.com/viewforum.php?f=89)


Once your sheet has cleared, or perhaps even have your character die or otherwise removed from play. You can have multiple characters accepted, and multiple accounts to your e-mail address.

I have a bit of experience playing 3.5 and 4E both offline and online and very minimal experience as a DM with a few friends years ago.

Looking to possibly try my hand as a DM and I'm possibly looking for players to play through a couple of one shots to get a feel and see how I like it.

I'm ideally looking for people that at least know the rules

This will likely be 4E as it's what I am currently playing. However I have also really been wanting to give Pathfinder and D&amp;D Next a go so I may run a few one shots with multiple rulesets

These will likely be official modules to keep things simple though as of yet undecided.

Time wise these will likely be run for 3-4 hours on either a Saturday or Sunday day

Is there any interest for an aspiring DM? I have noticed there seems to be a fair few more players than DM's looking for games. I wanted to try my hand at one shots before considering a more ambitious undertaking.

If all goes well I'll think about making this a semi-regular thing. Perhaps this will give some of the new players out there a chance to have a game! :)

I look forward to hearing from you all!

Edit: Just an update to everyone. I am wanting to run the first of these one shots in the next 2-3 weeks. I will likely use 4E using the [Dungeon Delve](http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/9780786951390) supplement to keep it nice and simple. I am not against running 2 games if I have a mix of players wanting to play weeknights or weekends. If this goes well I may look at other rulesets as I get more comfortable as a DM (Deadlands Classic or Pathfinder anyone?)

BE AWARE that I am new as a DM so players may have to bear with me while I get my head around everything. I am also happy to create or help assist with basic characters for those newish to the game. Another note is that I am mainly after players who work well together

*Yet in the darkness of the city

Fates Worse Than Death is a hard science-fiction cyber punk set in Manhattan in the year 2080. The best that humanity has to offer now live in gated communities that can, honesty, and intelligence, insuring that their communities are the healthiest in history. Those who continue to live in inner-city slums (which is what Manhattan has become) are those too poor, too rebellious, too unstable, too stupid, and must learn to survive on the streets.

The galaxy had become an even darker place than during the rise of the Empire. Treacherously, this pair of villains not only destroyed the Rebel Alliance, but ended the reign of Emperor Palpatine as they banded together to kill him. This last fact was hidden from the Imperial troops and the Galaxy at large, until, the Hand of the Emperor, Mara Jade, brought the truth to life.

In a shocking turn of events, not as a battle of Good versus Evil, but something more sinister. However, Darth Sidious was prepared for the Skywalkers' treachery. Using Mara Jade's body, the Emperor had resurrected himself, and as he revealed himself once more to the Galaxy, led Jade's forces in a siege on Coruscant. Sparking the new Golden Age of Sith, and he personally revealed himself to the fallen pair of Jedi

With the Empire being once more brought under Palpatine's control

To give an example of imbalanced and unpredictableness of Planescape while looking through the planescape monstrous compendium I
There's no way to classify that kind of exeprience in modern RPGs of the pimp from hell that can slaughter the party appearing if you piss off the succubus and the roll goes against you.

The actual setting is what really drags me in

1376778222.0,1kkn5p,"[Offline] [Warren, RI] Savage Worlds (Rippers/Necessary Evil) Sat, 5pm (EST)",BladeMaster0182,5,0

You've got two games running on alternating weeks to satisfy a wide range of gaming needs. Games are at the Game Den in Warren

First is Rippers. Play as part of a team of monster hunters in Victorian London. Hunt down werewolves, and more. Play with all the latest weapons and gadgets, call upon heavenly and eldritch forces, and search through tomes of dark knowledge. When all of that isn't enough to keep the forces of the monster-loving Cabal at bay, you can rip out parts of the monsters you kill and graft them into yourself, at the cost of your sanity. Span the globe and fight monsters to keep the world from plunging into darkness.

Second we have Necessary Evil. Aliens have invaded Earth and after a drawn-out war and a betrayal that would make the Lannisters proud, shouldn't it be you?

Savage Worlds is a lightweight generic system that can be used for any kind of adventure. It's easy to learn and easy to play. It prides itself on being Fast

If you want to join, and able to play nice with others (it's a team game after all). Contact me (Andrew) here or speak to Nate at the Game Den or on Facebook.

The Game Den is located on 16 Cutler Street

We're starting this Saturday (August 24th) with Necessary Evil

Hope to see you Saturday!",,t5_2rcvr,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/1kkn5p/offline_warren_ri_savage_worlds_rippersnecessary/

I've played play-by-post for several years at the same site, WH40k, L5R, Mechwarrior, Hunter: The Vigil, and other games. We've also had some Shadowrun, DnD, and many other system/settings.

Our current Star Wars Saga game is coming to a close within a few months and we'll be starting a new Star Wars Edge of the Empire game. A few of the players and the GM will be returning

There's lots of other games on the site as well
