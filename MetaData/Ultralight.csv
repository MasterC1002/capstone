1344642241.0,y0uxw,Going ultralight:  Cost per ounce,summiter,46,9,7,"There have been some threads both on BackpackingLight.com and here from people thinking of moving ultralight.  For some it is ignoring the stereotype that UL is cold

The general practice of going ultralight begins with the least expensive equipment so you can sample the idea without committing outright.  I just submitted a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/y0tz5/losing_a_pound_is_simple_and_cheap_just_know/) giving an example 1.5lb savings for less than $20.  There is no immediate need to dive head-first into $500 debt - try first eliminating redundant or 'fear' items.  People will pack extra clothes for fear of being cold; rain gear even if no rain is in the forecast; and extra shoes in case one pair gets wet.  These are unnecessary and are driven by fear.  Understand your limits, and understand it's not the end of the world if you get moist.

Once you remove unnecessary items and begin replacing simple items like Nalgenes and stainless steel cookwear, then 10.  You begin to realize the UL philosophy is not about comfort sacrifice... in fact, you've never been more comfortable lounging in a Hennesy Hammock all day at a scant 10% of the weight of your former 3-person tent!  But you need to draw the line soon.  Personally I spent over $5000 on equipment and I have but one spare piece to show for it (an windproof tech vest from MH).  Being very spartan, researching heavily before committing to purchase, and selling or trading old items have given me a thorough understanding of just how much UL can cost.  But many ULer's have not and have acquired over the years a pleathora of extra equipment at an outstanding cost.  I offer you the chance to prevent overpurchase and manage this transition using the 'cost per ounce' line in the sand.

How much is saving an ounce worth to you?  $1?  $10?  You are told every ounce adds up and that one ounce here and one ounce there will eventually equal a pound in savings.  But if each ounce costs $25 are you ready to pay $400 for a pound?  In the beginning it's simple: 7oz Nalgene replace by a 1oz Gatorade bottle - $0.14/ounce.  Trading your old equipment for something lighters - 18oz for free - $0/16ounce.  But then you begin to see you need a new pack.  Your existing one is 3.5lbs.  The one you want is 1.5lbs but costs $250.  $250/32oz

When this line needs to be deep and set in stone is when the UL bug has bitten and bitten hard.  You have a 24oz sleeping bag but want a 17oz quilt for $350

Put it into perspective.  A lot of us have not.  Draw the line and find the cheaper solution.",self,t5_2s7p2,1344643091.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/y0uxw/going_ultralight_cost_per_ounce/

Over the last few years, but still set me back well over $1000.  I was careful with what I selected and after cutting my sleeping pad to fit my pack (ULA OHM - Awesome pack btw).  I finally felt like I had achieved a nice, compact kit that could serve me well on a 5 day hike without resupplying, in weather down to 0 degrees celsius.

I'm in Canada where UL isn't as popular.  I spent a lot of time finding lighter counterparts to the gear here and ordering them from the States

Anyhow, bear spray, rope for hanging a bear bag, tooth paste, compass, bug juice, soap, extra utensils etc. to which he said yes.  

Low and behold on the day, maybe a 30L.  He then has clothes and ground sheets and stuff hanging off of that pack.  It was insane.  I suggested he leave as much as possible but he insisted it wasn't too heavy.  I felt his pack and although it was considerably heavier than mine, it didn't strike me as insanely heavy.  Maybe around 40 - 50 lbs or so (amazing given it's volume). 

Anyhow, it was great.  That night I saw him rummaging through his pack looking for something, he said he was looking for his toothpaste.  I told him, ""Oh, I have some, remember I said I'd cover that"".  His response was ""It's okay, I brought 2 kinds"".  This gives you a sense of what I was dealing with. 

The next morning we're packing our gear

We're trudging along and then he starts to complain of a sore knee.  We stop, he insists on continuing.  Finally, after lunch, we take another break (after only a short distance of walking) and I realize he's not in good shape.  He's limping badly and looking exhausted.  We still had about 12 KM to go and I look at the map and realize that due to his breaks and slowness, we've only travelled about 2 Km in 4 hours.  We start trying to formulate a plan, which finally ends with him taking some asprin, putting a tenser bandage on, we made it back to our car.  I was pretty pooped having carried a lot of his stuff

Fast forward an hour and we're driving out of the park.  It's pitch black and I see a someone waving a light on the side of the road.  We're in the middle of nowhere and there's this older guy with a cane.  We pull over

Amazing fellow, has been hitchhiking his way east.  Says he was robbed in Toronto and has blood stains and missing teeth that match his story.  Says he hasn't eaten all day.  He spent the whole trip talking about Karma.  How it's the one thing he's sure of in this world.  If you do good to others, good will come back, if you do bad.... blah blah blah.  

We reach the tiny town he's headed to which is completely dead, a pair of merino wool socks, we give him food, he sits down about 100 ft. away and starts devouring the snacks we gave him.  He's incredibly grateful, we wish him well, rearrange some stuff in the trunk and leave.

Finally I get home.  I'm exhausted.  I was exhausted when we finished the hike.

I go to the trunk to get my pack

Either myself, gone.  I think of that guy sitting there when we drove off.  He PROBABLY saw the pack and given the extent I've called places in that small town, it sounds like he made no attempt to return it, he likely took it.  He needed stuff, for sure.  He needed money to get home and I guess my gear may have helped him do that.

Anyhow, Credit Card, Debit Card and Driver's License and put it in a baggie with some $20 bills.  That goes in my tiny pocket on the hip belt of my pack.  Problem is, I had taken that out once the hike was over.

So, I am going to leave contact info in my bag and on some of my gear.  It's an extra couple of grams that will be well worth it.",,False,self,t5_2s7p2,1338331553.0,,

I (M21, 6ft 135lbs) want to start camping and hiking. Also, being my age, I don't have a lot of 'general things' that aren't my parents' (like cooking stuff, tools, etc). Therefore, I'm pretty much starting from scratch.


Specifics: Let's not include food in the budget, running shoes, etc). Lastly, I've done research on tent vs hammock vs tarp and I believe I want to get a tent. Finally, I'm very heavily leaning towards building the cat food stove, so that won't cost any money.

Most of my trips I do solo and am usually using a bivy sack for weight reasons. Having been stuck in one during bad weather on more than one occasion

Essentially it's a four season, tent/bivi. It's big enough to sit up in and cook if you have to wait out a storm, but packs down to less than 3.5 lbs, just a few ounces more than some of the poled bivy sacks and 3-season tent options out there, but since it was designed as an alpine tent, it can withstand significant wind and snow. You have to keep the snow from building up on the foot box portion just like any bivy sack but the tent body is absolutely bomb proof.

NOTE: These are not available to the public unless you want to order 100 of them. I just thought that if anyone could appreciate this weirdly niche tent it's be you guys.

I've really noticed the weight difference from using light gear, and am therefore hooked on experimenting with lighter gear to lessen the load on my legs, open up more exciting path choices and all the other up-sides I don't have to mention.


My experience with the TT double rainbow so far has been pretty good when the weather is good (read: summer), it feels like it just isn't shelter enough. The wind simply blows through, effectively lowering the temperature inside the tent and generally making the experience less enjoyable. Looking at other shelter options, such as the Zpacks hexamid, it seems to me many or most of them don't really give you a closed-off space or protection from whatever the wind throws at you, be it snow, sleet or rain.

So, or do I have to give in to the teasing of my fellow hikers and admit the ultralight thing doesn't really cut it in these conditions?

I am a college student, due to time and money restraints. I dont really have the gear to do this!

My school offers gear rentals, which isn't awful, but if I'm going to spend that much, I would rather buy the bag outright. I've poked around online a little, and it seems like there are some good bags available for under $50. Any suggestions on brands, features, or specific bags to look into?

It does not have all of the best ultralight gear on the planet

so far I'm looking at the Eureka Spitfire for the tent. The tent or tarp would ideally be fitted for 1+ because I want something light for solo trips

Sleeping pad: I was actually thinking of straying from the catalog to getting http://www.amazon.com/Thermarest-Z-Lite-SOL-Sleeping-Pad/dp/B0075JUVAI/ref=pd_sim_sg_7 this bad boy because I don't know how I feel about inflattable pads. If anyone can sway me one way or the other feel free to give suggesstions!

Sleeping bag... well

Stove/cooking unit: I'm definitely considering the optimus crux with the terra wekend cook system. may be overkill for me alone vs the terra solo cook system, but they don't host MSR, so I was thinking of getting a whisperlight instead, for I'm not too keen on the waste produced by cartridge stoves nor do I like the lack of control on alcohol burners.

Basically is the Ray Jardine stuff any good? I couldn't find the weights of anything on the site.  I get that they vary somewhat because you sew it yourself but you gotta tell us what it weighs!

I have access to a sewing machine and have used it a couple times but am far from experienced with it.

Basically

quilt         $83
tarp         $63
net tent   $61    (lots of skeeters and no see ums where I backpack)
backpack  $60

total        $267
weight: unsure

If the ray way stuff isn't any good I would lean towards

g4 ul or smd swift      $110-125
golite ul800 quilt        $200
tarptent contrail or moment $200-240 (I'm not the biggest fan of trekking poles)

total              $510-575
weight   65 oz to 70 oz

Basically I'm gonna try and purchase the equipment based on how cheaply I can save weight.  Probably get the backpack later though when my base weight gets down some more.


Getting the ray way stuff would be a savings of around $300.  If the weight of the ray stuff was comparable and the quality was there I would seriously consider going that route.  Obviously quality depends somewhat on how well you sew but are the materials high quality? good instructions?

One major pro for stoves is that you can poor boiling water into a nalgene bottle and shove that into your sleeping bag for extra warmth...

I'm planning a trip in the pacific NW later this summer, but when I've used it in similar terrain in the past, I've always been cold. I'm debating between investing in a 30ish degree synthetic bag, or adding a liner to my existing one. It seems like most synthetic bags in that range are pretty heavy, with most around 3 lbs.

The idea is that I want to plan for a three-day hiking trip in the Fall or Winter

a) need to buy some new stuff and 

b) want to go more lightweight.

Here's a download link: 

https://www.dropbox.com/s/8lnb2no25ao3ul2/ultralight-reddit.xlsx

If you look at the second-to-last column, it might be best to re-enter some of them, especially if you're outside of the US.  However, I did get all of the weights down, which I have heard are sometimes incorrect (it's the best info I have now).  I tried to include shipping/tax costs on some of them, but I do have an REI membership and Amazon prime... so it's not perfect but close.

I am thinking of doing some more with this in the future

Some other notes:

- The black box indicates items I have no choice but to bring

- I put capacities for bags on the side

- It's quite subjective.  Maybe you won't like some of the choices I put in.  It was made for a guy

- I am missing some important items, gps, *food* etc.  It's a WIP.

- It's focused on fall weather for now.

The final cost for me to get down to 20lbs (before food) is $909! It starts to get interesting once you go down to about 15lbs

If you cut your Thermarest Z-Lite along a fold, you get two pads for the price of one. Granted, these are going to be Torso and 3/4 pads, which might not work for you. But if you're sleeping on just a Z-Lite as it is, chances are you will be fine. 

I'm just over 5'7"", and my pack / extra clothes / quilt excess for my legs, and I barely notice it. Let's face it, that leg cushioning isn't doing much, it's just insulation.

Second option: Do this, it is another layer between the ground and your fragile inflatable! ;)

For you Mariposa Plus users, but in my experience that does not happen with the shorter pad. Considering the full Z-Lite is kind of bulky to pack, this is a great alternative, and I'm happy with the convenience of having my pad accessible for rest stops and naps!",,False,self,True,t3_t0t2d

I'm going back to Central America and taking a different approach to it this time. This is not just a leisure trip

I just returned from an 8 month trip to Central America and learned a lot about what I should, what are some tricks or items you take or can't live with out when traveling(traveling anywhere for that matter). I'm headed back to Central America again and could use some new ideas. I'm scrapping my luggage plan and going back with a 75 liter pack that has a secondary compartment that is removable hip pack for quick travel and keeping my documents on me at all times, I imagine I'll be using this quite a bit. Bug repellents and sun block are so expensive down there that I prefer to take it with, but it consumes a lot of space, I wish there was an alternative to deet in a can. This post just reminded me of one thing I wished I had my entire trip...a hammock! I'm going to track down a small ""hammock in a bag"" type of item for my pack...and a compression pillow, YES! 

Cool tricks for packing, you get the idea, please share! 

EDIT: I'm also a fan of coral [reef safe sunblock](http://www.tropicalseas.com/). It requires more reapplying because it isn't waterproof or as water resistant as the normal stuff. The area I just returned from and headed back to again is part of the 2nd biggest reefs in the world so I try to help out where I can. 

This compression [pillow](http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-compressible-pillow) and [hammock](http://www.eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com/single-nest-hammock.html) are going with me on this trip. On work days I spent quite a bit of time an island and there was one hammock, and a couple splintered old wood benches on the entire island. People were in them about 99% of the time....I was usually in the other 1%. The aforementioned hammocks are very small, lightweight, and packs into itself for ease of storage and minimal space usage. The Therm-Rest compression pillows are awesome on planes, trains, and automobiles.....and for general sleeping and relaxing while on the road. 

Believe it or not I really like [field stripped MRE's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbhfHskOw68#t=00m05s). I usually get them shipped down after a couple of months in order to give my stomach a break. i like to take them out in my flight bag for when I get stuck somewhere and I need some calories.  

My Nalgene bottles, they'll be going again as well. I wouldn't mind a [steripen](http://www.steripen.com/) in place of my other items, I'll get one in the future. 

Anybody have any luck with all natural bug repellents? I go through quite a bit of Off because if I didn't have it I would look like [this](http://imgur.com/ds9ll) everyday. These bites are from tiny little flies, but I use a lot of it.

Ziplock bags are a must, a dry storage [pouch/bags](http://www.rei.com/product/780949/outdoor-research-dry-ditty-sacks-set-of-3) and a smaller [case](http://www.rei.com/product/778218/pelican-1060-case-with-carabiner) for phones, documents, point and shoot camera e.g.  Thanks for the comment and happy trails.

My biggest problem is the heavy tent (it's raining a lot, I want somewhere warm, dry, and spacious at night), but replacing that with a bivy and tarp is too expensive at the last minute. The stove could be replaced, but I'm reluctant to do it not knowing if I can find fuel when I'm out there.

    Total Water Boiled:  50.7cups (12L) &lt;-- [lab conditions]*
    Total Water Boiled:  28cups (6.6L) &lt;--  [real world test]**

------------------------------

An alcohol stove weighs approximately 0.3oz (8.5g) and, 8.5g) to keep the setup somewhat even.  Carrying roughly half of a standard 16oz water bottle (.5oz, 13g) with ethanol fuel (.79g/ml = 186.9g) narrows the weight difference with the Jetboil system to within a few ounces.  An alcohol stove burns approximately .6oz (a little over 1/16 of a cup) per 2cup boiling session meaning 8oz of fuel boils only 26.6cups (6.3L) of water.

    Total Weight:  11oz (312g)
    Total Water Boiled:  26.6cups (6.3L) &lt;-- [real world test]***

-----------------

So is the penny stove the best ultralight solution?  Well, duration of trip, environmental temperature, availability of fuel, and empty fuel storage and recycling... but it actually looks like this new Jetboil titanium edition warrants some serious consideration in the UL community.

I am wondering if anyone else has this problem and how they fixed it.  

I am thinking about sewing some fleece on the quilt where my face rubs it.  Do you think this would work?

The other question is about a pillow.  I was using a nylon stuff sack filled with a down vest

What are ways of getting a lightweight but comfortable pillow?

*Things I am already aware of that you will probably call me out on:*

I know I don't need both the tent/pad and hammock. I always prefer the hammock and when it is cold I will use the pad in the hammock for insulation. Also

I have multiple fire starting options and I didn't even include the fire piston that is on it's way. This is because I am new to this and want to test out all of the methods and see which suits me the best and that means carrying a bit extra for now. I am OK with this.

The water filter. Hindsight I think I may regret getting that, but we will see. In Europe I doubt I'll have much need for it, but in NZ I wager I'll use it a fair bit.

[MLD Bug Bivy](http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=22&amp;products_id=55)
I like that this has a little bit of wind protection with the silny on either end. Also I could sit up. Seems like the roomiest and sturdiest.

[MLD Serenity Shelter](http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=35&amp;products_id=120)

I like the water resistent lower half of the bivy.

I'm leaning towards either of the Mountain Laurel options but it looks like its at least an 8 week wait before they're shipped... and I'm impatient. Anyone have any experience with any of these three or any other ideas? I value lightness and cheapness. I don't own a sewing machine though and don't really have access to one so MYOG isn't really something I'm looking at much. Wouldn't rule it totally out though.

[Here is the REI page for this pack](http://www.rei.com/product/828406/osprey-hornet-46-pack)

UPDATE: I received both the small and medium pack in the mail. The small was waaay too short- the load lifters were about level, I'm a 5'5"" woman, why would I need a size large? The hipbelt on the medium fits, but only if I cinch it alll the way down. Also, I was under the impression that women had proportionally larger hips vs. height, so why am I cinching down the hipbelt on this men's pack? 
  
I took it out for a 3 hour trek, and the hipbelt is quite comfortable. I love all the features on this pack- lots of ways to brace the load/ stow items without much bulk. Very streamlined and well thought out. I especially like the side compression straps- you can route them inside or outside the side pockets, which also happen to be accessible from the top or side. This is also my first pack where you put a hydration pack in between the framesheet and the main compartment. I tried it, and I think it's a nice feature, though hard to get the bladder in/out while the pack is loaded.  
  
If I had to complain about one thing (besides the somewhat weird sizing) it would be the roughness of the shoulder straps. I like to wear sleeveless shirts

1. Loosen your laces down to the second or so eyelets. Enough that there's only a couple inches of ""tie-able"" lace left sticking out the top.

2. Pull the tongue up away from your foot

3. Tie a loose knot in each string


4. Tie the laces together in a loose knot.

Basically, you won't be getting your socks wetter.

I've already got one of Big Agnes' insulated sleeping pads

I'm just starting to get into ultralight camping and this looked like a great bag for that since I've been very happy with the Big Agnes gear I've used in the past. I'm not a hardcore gram counter so I don't need some kind of uber-expensive-unicorn-hair-ultralight liner; just something that'll keep me comfortable at lower temps than the bag is rated.
