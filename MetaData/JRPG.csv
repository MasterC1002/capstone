.

My name is Steve; I'm one of the creators of Nameless: the Hackers.  We're a group of 2.5 guys who quit our jobs

. 

It's always been my dream to create a JRPG.  I grew up with the classics such as Chrono Trigger, Phantasy Star, SoM, etc...
The story

When I got an iPhone, it was very apparent that something felt missing.  Though the games were ported, and working.  That's what it felt like, a straight port.  I realized how different the touchscreen felt compared to a controller.  It turned me off immediately from furthering my adventures!  And, these RPG games were also extremely expensive.  17 dollars?  That is just crazy.  Especially because I can barely play through it due to the controls.  It was just a negative experience for me.  A few games managed to do it well, such as ""The World Ends With You"", but a vast majority felt awkward.  Thus

.

Make a JRPG with controls designed for touch and also take the opportunity to try something completely new.  

.

The game's theme is about living the life of an ""underground"" hacker for hire and all the craziness that ensues.  The game features a global conspiracy in present day and has references to current technology and cyberpunk elements.

.

That's also a more serious problem with JRPGs since they're usually very long. I find myself wasting 30 hours of game progress because I don't want to continue without remembering what has happened before.

I did it with Persona 3. The first time I played it was during a vacation to another state on my cousin's PS2. I played almost half of the game in a week (fucking love this game). Eventually

The problem is, I still knew about the Dark Hour and the overall important points, but I had forgotten all the little details that make this game so great!

So this post began as just talking about Crimson Echoes and Flames of Eternity but blew up into every good CT ROM hack

For those that don't know of these, highly anticipated to be the penultimate fan hack that would fill everyone's desire to a more direct sequel to CT than Chrono Cross was. However Square Enix sent a [cease and desist letter](http://www.destructoid.com/square-enix-shuts-down-chrono-fan-game-crimson-echoes-131702.phtml) three weeks before the official release of the project, much to the dismay of EVERYONE. Luckily just under two years later the 98% beta build was leaked on Emu Paradise!. For a summary:

&gt;Crimson Echoes takes place right after the events of Chrono Trigger in the year 1005 AD. It starts where Marle and Crono are discussing the big tomorrow. Marle drilling Crono's head not to sleep in. They kiss and make their way home. Crono (Still living with his mom) is yet again be force to awaken but this time by Marle.

&gt;Crono, our three heroes are caught in an unstable Time Gate generated by a Time Egg replica. They all share glimpses of events across time featuring their old friends, then find themselves greeted by Robo in the year 2305, who is assisting Belthasar in his hidden facility. And so the untold story of the eternally burning flames begins...

And for those who want to watch it

After CE's cancellation another fan picked up the project and produced [Flames of Eternity](http://metronomeproject.blogspot.com/), it's all up on [Let's Play Flames of Eternity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svMe2X9pAQs) on YouTube. It got to a very final build, RC7 which only had a few missing features to be added, namely:

* Expanded Mall in 2305
* More open 2305 AD Overworld Map
* This includes a 2305 AD Medina
* Being able to skip the introduction

But for what you are all really waiting for

**NOTE:** These are NOT ROM files. You will need to get a copy of the Chrono Trigger ROM to patch and play these. For your convenience

Additionally there are several other ROM hacks which are worth exploring to various degrees which I have summaries below (Note I copied these summaries from another website which I won't link to since it has the SNES and NDS CT ROMs at the top). All of these are in the link with Crimson Echoes and Flames of Eternity. But first let us take a moment to mourn the loss of another CT Project [Chrono Trigger Resurrection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxxwZSafh3E) and [Preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuAkxoSFdSA).

Chrono Trigger: Prophet's Guile - YouTube [Playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HVqPqvrJVE)
&gt; Chrono Trigger: Prophet’s Guile is another extensive hack, and full of surprises. Click [here](http://i.imgur.com/aNynoXP.png) for some screen shots.

Chrono Trigger Retranslation
&gt;The Chrono Trigger Retranslation gives you a chance to experience Chrono Trigger in its purity. Every single line is properly translated. Nothing is left out, attacks, spells, espers, etc.) have their proper name. The original challenge is retained (US release was made easier). Various bugs have been corrected. In other words, this is ""Chrono Trigger : PERFECT Edition"".

Chrono Trigger Coliseum
&gt;This incredible hack installs a battle arena in 2300 A.D. Three ladders of monsters exist for three difficulties - easy, ""battle points"" are earned. These can be traded for high class items in the right of the coliseum. Cool huh? But it's important that you read the 'readme' before using it, as it explains important details.

Chrono Trigger Hard Type
&gt;Do you think Chrono Trigger is way too easy? Well then apply the Hard Type patch! Here's a segment of the Read Me: ""Basically, the character stats have been lowered to a degree, so when you hit certain peak levels you will not be as powerful as you would be in the original version. One more thing I did to add more of a challenge to the game is remove most equipment from the characters, so your defense will not be very high at the beginning. The tradeoff is that you get more experience from battles, so you will have the chance to get to a high level early in the game.""

Chrono Trigger Spoof #1
&gt;This is a 'spoof patch'. Spoof patches are applied to English R0Ms as if you were applying an English patch to a Jap R0M. This patch replaces about half of the main dialogue with hilarious jokes. Important aspects of the storyline are still retained. Click [here](http://i.imgur.com/729Jgdj.gif) for some screen shots.

Chrono Trigger Spoof #2
&gt;This spoof replaces almost all of the dialogue in the beginning of the game with hilarious perverted jokes. Click [here](http://i.imgur.com/ZRifJaW.gif) for some screen shots.

1364799489.0,1ber7z,FF XII is the epitome of the statistics portion of tabletop RPGs,torts92,81,22,59,"Skyrim is just the imaginative role playing part of those tabletops. The comparison between Skyrim and XII is this: XII is the epitome of the statistical based tabletop role playing game. The math working behind the scenes is an RPG enthusiast's wet dream

What XII champions in RPGs, Elder Scrolls re-interprets the table top RPG. Elder Scrolls and Bioware games drop you in a world and instruct you to break the rules and live in that world. XII on the other hand presents you a world filled with rules and a concrete setting like any other traditional FF, yet hidden within is a set of tools that allows a skilled, intuitive role playing fan to break those rules and bend the world to your characters' will. This in no way takes away from the depth of culture written into the game world. It is a quality game - quality at what it does, which is entirely unlike ""open-world"" and especially sandbox games. XII is a unique open-world. Mundanely described as half-opened, or to haters, half-assed open world. The story is still on rails but you can force the train off the tracks, it is one and only game where it's presentation of your character(s) in an open world doesn't detract from that world - it's wonderful atmosphere

There are monsters in the game that will kill you in one hit if you choose to fight them. For example, a normally ferocious creature). See, the T-Rex’s life bar is displayed in green, which the instruction manual clearly tells the player means the enemy will not attack. That many players just go ahead and attack the T-Rex is indicative of their belief in common sense (a T-Rex is murderous — fight for your life) 

Gambits. This is where director Hiroyuki Ito shines most — in creating straightforward game concepts that eliminate waste. Ito saw a way to get rid of the tedium of role-playing games (heal when low on HP, attack, get hurt, heal again, attack, attack) by implementing a simple AI programming scheme. The dead simplicity of the AI programming scheme, however, generally, freezing the action when he sees fit to make adjustments on the battle plan (stronger enemies appear

First, but it seems about right.  What this means to you is that you shouldn't sweat anything under a 7% difference.  For example, FFVII beat FFIX by about 2.5% when you only count the positive votes.  Don't get your panties in a wad and start raging about how much better IX was.  This poll statistically cannot guarantee accuracy to that degree.

Second, and I think that is reasonable.  I'll make sure to incorporate it in the future.  Also, I realized that not everyone is aware of the official recommended games list, nor do they particularly care what is in it.  I'll hold a nomination thread next time so that people have the opportunity to add in games and correct cross-platform information.  Finally, I'll spend some more time polishing the survey.  It looks like I accidentally misspelled a few titles, and left some series grouped together while others were separated by installment.

So here are some big differences in the Japanese game market to think about when discussing JRPGs.

Let's look at this article to highlight some points
http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ja&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fmantan-web.jp%2F2013%2F07%2F02%2F20130702dog00m200011000c.html&amp;act=url

1. This SHOULD seem obvious but JRPGs and Japanese games in general generally sell much better then WRPGs and other western titles. New Etrian Odyssey and the newest Atelier game (Escha &amp; Logy) outsold the Last of Us.

2. Due to tight living spaces, Vita were selling out after the recent price drop and the bevy of new titles coming out for it so declaring it dead is silly.

3. Rentals, a rental chain much like Blockbuster. Except it's still a huge chain instead of slowly going out of business. Digital distribution is many years behind to the point that the maker of Bayonetta didn't even know about Valve. This is why Sony would have been crazy to follow Xbox One's (now dead) DRM model in their home country.

4. PC gaming in Japan is mostly eroge, and adventure/visual novels. Due to tight living spaces, many people don't even own PCs. Most use PCs mostly for work and have been using mobile devices for email long before smartphones. For example, Diablo 3 did NOT EVEN GET RELEASED in Japan likely due to poor sales of Diablo 2.

At first I thought this is going to be really hard and time consuming and kind of pushed it off. I am currently a collector of these types of games specializing mainly in the Playstation era and thought to myself that a list would be more than helpful. This list would help me keep track of not only what I have and what I do not have but what I have played and what I have not played yet. 


With this being said I am going to start actively start working on completing the list as of today. I will be starting with Playstation and working my way to completion. It will take a great deal of time to complete as there are quite a number of these and I am doing it on my free time which is limited. This will be a bare minimum of information 

What I want from the community:

I have added the title Alundra today as an example of the format that I will be using throughout the entire process. Title,EU), Developer, Publisher(JP,NA,EU), and Type. I currently have never done anything like this ever and it is my first attempt so I am asking the community their opinions. I would like to keep to basic information so that the user can research the game for themselves. Also if you already have a list from other systems that you would like to share with me that would be greatly appreciated. 

One question that I would like ask is: 
How are you able to line break in this format ? I want something like this.

* JP Release Date 
* NA Release Date 
* EU Release Date

These are to all be in the same cell without the bullets.

What are your opinions? What are your suggestions? 

Edit: Please Up Vote so that more can see this and express their opinions. Remember there is no Karma in self posts. Again thank you !


Edit 2: Actively working on it today take a look please. The one thing I am doing is putting the different names that the game receives in different regions. Do you think that is too much ? does it look cluttered ? Should I not included them ?

1365328373.0,1buh1h,My thoughts on: Valkyria Chronicles [Discussion],Senshouzan,40,6,13,"So I've been on a binge lately to play the latest JRPGs

I wanted to write my thoughts on some JRPGs in this subforum particularly for two main reasons. Firstly, I was hoping for some honest and thoughtful feedback to my own opinions to help explore viewpoints on the game as a whole. So let's begin.

Gameplay:

Perhaps the most interesting concept of Valkyria Chronicles to me- and probably the biggest reason why I would consider this game successful, on a mental  or emotional level, then it's usually not worth any reasonable investment of time.

Valkyria Chronicles is structured in such a way that constantly has you engaged in what is going on in the map. There's very little on the battlefield that is beyond the player's control outside of the enemy, sit down and consider their next move before proceeding. At the same time, it isn't simply chess with guns either- enemies on the map will respond to your movements and open fire if you are in their line of fire during your movement phase. This helps to maintain some tension in the battle, and it adds a little to my immersion on the battlefield- it would be hard for me to believe that the enemy would idly stare at you running about in the thick of combat without making some sort of attempt to stop you. It's a pleasant minor touch that I couldn't help but appreciate; it gives the opponent a chance to respond to you in a turn-based environment without stripping the player of his thinking time entirely.

The greatest failing of this system, attack and use orders in real-time. In fact, in the time it took for the opponent to complete their phase of the battle, I had gone upstairs, grabbed a drink, used the toilet and returned with enough time to catch up on where they had moved. I don't think this would irk me if battles were short- but they're not. Some missions would take me up to an hour to complete, and half of that time was spent watching soldiers move around on the battlefield that aren't under my control. I really don't see any reason why they couldn't have added a speed-up or skip options

It is worth noting how laughably easy it was to break the entire experience. Alicia, take essentially limitless crossfire damage, hit any target with a guarantee and dodge almost anything if they live long enough to return fire. It is up to the player if they wish to play in this manner, but there's very little incentive not to. Getting a good rank on a mission rewards you for cutting corners, and the tedious wait to make your moves again can be compelling to end things on the first turn and skip on through. I don't think any less of the game for it, but it was an issue that I found to be somewhat distracting from the game's playability. While I could battle through and rely on tactics as was intended, it's much simpler and much more rewarding to exploit Alicia. It seems almost like the game penalizes you for playing it as intended sometimes.

Story:

[The story in Valkyria Chronicles is another part of the experience that I felt succeeded in it's attempts to bring in the player. Though the subject matter is the much-explored topic of war, and I felt a very sharp pang of remorse when I watched the wounded Imperial soldier die under the care of Welkin and Alicia. Some of this experience seemed cheapened to me however, as the game stops to give the player something to ponder about, only to have them returning to shooting enemy soldiers in the face the next mission simply because they are standing in your way. It would have been nice to see if this experience would have any impact on the characters through the rest of the story, but it doesn't seem to be touched on again afterwards. I think a mission where the Imperial squad sneaks you through their lines without combat would have tied the message up a lot tidier than the way it was.](/spoiler)

[One other thing that crossed my mind was the issue of ragnite, and I felt it was a bit bizarre to have such a large issue- large enough to spark a massive continental war, be pushed aside in the manner that it was. By no means should it have been more prevalent than the Valkyrur plot, but I felt it should have been present at the very least.](/spoiler)

[While talking about the story of Valkyria Chronicles, Rosie, Largo, Isara and Zaka are all characters that are easy to relate to and bring color to Squad 7's composition. They all have distinctly unique traits about them, but none of it ever came off as being unfitting or unbelievable to the setting- which is a balance that many storytellers struggle to strike many times. I would have been perfectly happy with just the main characters being interesting, but the entire recruitable roster for Squad 7 is comprised of characters just as colorful and interesting as any of the main cast. It's a bit of a shame then, really, I thoroughly enjoyed every character of my squad

[The story thoroughly hooked me, but it was a bit jarring to be treated to that world for a minute at a time before you are yanked out and given a menu again. I really don't think it would have been too much effort then, simply to link together the little cutscenes and dialogue options, and divide them where appropriate. As nice as the storybook presentation is, and as well as it sets up the entire world, it starts to undermine itself as it forces you to navigate the story sequence by sequence, which is further broken up by long loading times.](/spoiler)

[The last part of the story I wanted to touch on was Isara's death. It shook me about as much as I would expect it to shake anyone playing Valkyria Chronicles with a degree of involvement, the Darcsen racism issue. But I couldn't help but wonder, however, was why Welkin wasn't more prevalent in the cutscene where Isara is fatally shot. It seems like too much of the focus is on Rosie, who only just recently started to accept the idea of befriending her. While it's not a bad thing to give her some screentime to develop upon their relationship, it seemed a bit unbelievable to me that her brother and her existing relationship with him wasn't given more consideration before her character was killed off. She holds a brief discussion with Welkin discussing her wish to let him fly, and this element carries on in a meaningful way related to the story with the creation of the ISARA plane that rescues Welkin and Alicia, it was a bit questionable to present him as being so visibly unfazed. It seems a bit minor in hindsight, but I feel a lot of the elements that are later integral to the plot would have had more meaning if Isara's death struck her brother a little harder than it did.](/spoiler)

Presentation:

Nobody could argue Valkyria Chronicle's presentation to be faulty. The unique and vibrant watercolor style breathes a sort of life into the game and it's world that makes it much more engaging to be a part of. I found myself drinking in much of the beautifully rendered world of Gallia during some cutscenes and missions

The stylized approach to Valkyria Chronicles makes it incredibly pleasant to experience, it is naturally going to age much worse. Just recently I had booted it up, and the visuals seemed blurrier and worse off from what I had remembered, whereas this 2008 title continues to awe me 5 years later.

To tie together the presentation, and the immaculate quality of the character lines made Squad 7's troops become much more colorful and interesting after you take them into combat, and hear their unique lines delivered with convincing personality. I played through Valkyria Chronicles with the Japanese dub because that is the version that the original developers intended to go with their writing, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well the English voices suited the characters as well. It just seemed like every design choice in the game's presentation was very deliberate and focused, which really ties together the entire atmosphere.

Overall:

The game was one of the most pleasant surprises I've had the honor of experiencing. While I do question some of the game's implementations, but didn't touch on, such as the levelling and research system and the purchasable extra scenes. Including cutscenes, Valkyria Chronicles took me about 22 hours to complete all of it's gameplay and story. The last 5 missions were beat in a single turn though, and I have yet to watch all of the extra report scenes, so it's not hard to imagine that this game could extend past 25 or even into 30. With future replays and DLC, the dedicated could easily sink over three times of what I have so far.

Though my main concern with games of a hearty length is staleness, even if it does force me to sit through long periods of waiting. I've been hearing a lot of chatter about JRPGs declining in quality in recent years, but if titles like Valkyria Chronicles continue to come out onto the scene, I honestly would not give that concern a second thought.

1350865902.0,11vbre,Why I had more fun with Final Fantasy 13 than Final Fantasy 13-2,hayashirice911,45,8,30,"So I recently finished 13-2 and I had a lot of fun with it...but I had more fun with FF13.

Now when you put the two of them on paper, but why is it that I liked 13 better? 

I think the biggest element was that, or why I was there and it felt like some areas had little relevance to them besides a grind. Look at Chrono Trigger, which did this right. *Every* single time had great relevance in the story. If you were missing *one* timeline, you would not have been able to complete the journey. There is 2300 A.D. which motivates Chrono to defeat lavos, 600 A.D. where you meet Melchior, the prehistoric times where you recover a ruby to restore the Masamune etc etc. In 13-2 you were absolutely overwhelmed with areas (that sometimes felt like copy pasted levels) that felt like it was just there just for the hell of it. I understand that they wanted a lot of content for the gamer, which is a good mindset by square, so it would have been better if they tried to find a balance between the two. I hate to sound like a parrot, or whatever you wanted to do.

The second is the weak and limited cast of characters. I think the strongest character was probably Noel, Snow, Sazh, Hope, Vanille, and Fang. As corny and melodramatic as they were, I actually loved them a lot. It felt like I was following the journey of a close-knit family

Lastly, it doesn't matter what character you use, but rather the ""numbers"" that they bring to the table. So for example. if Snow was a carbon copy of Fang, it would make no difference whatsoever which one you used in battle. But you would still prefer to use the character that you prefer in battle because well...you want to feel their presence in the battlefield. In 13-2 you had one creature in your battle that I personally didn't feel attached to at all. Yeah you can put little adornments on them and level them up, but that is not enough ""development"" for me to care for them.

Well that's basically it I guess. For those of you who played both of them,False,,t5_2quw1,1350953966.0,,,t3_11vbre

I'm writing a book about programming jRPGs but I'd also like to discuss the non-technical parts like plots.

In the past I've done Nanowrimo which, then expand to three lines and then expand each of those three lines and so on until you feel you can start"".

I thought that might be instructive to do in reverse for existing jRPG games. I know this smacks a little of   


&gt;  
&gt;""If you try and take a cat apart to see how it works
&gt;  



but it seems like a pretty good  way to get some idea of classic plot structures and see what reoccurring patterns spill out. I've done this for some of the first Final Fantasy games but I'd interested if people agree with my break down (and if they'd like to offer their own from other games that would be cool). I think the early Final Fantasy's are hard because the plots often veer perilously close to nonsense!

Even though these games are super old I've spoilered them as




**Final Fantasy 1**

One-line: [*Four warriors must defeat four fiends to restore power to four orbs*](/spoiler)

Three-line:

- 1. [Four warriors
- 2. [To defeat four fiends
- 3. [Killing the fiends restores the orb's power but they discover Garland is a time-travelling demon they must defeat](/spoiler)

**Final Fantasy 2**

- 2. [They rebel against the empire but one of them turns evil](/spoiler)
- 3. [The Emperor returns as a demon and they join forces to kill him](/spoiler)

- 2. [They discover a Warlock called Xande is trying to get the crystal for nefarious reasons](/spoiler)

- Surprise demons from nowhere are a popular early Final Fantasy favorite!
- There's usually a fake bad guy that's merely a puppet of the ""true evil force""

In the past, I've kept the more established original and removed the copies, which I don't feel is particularly fair. In the interest of fairness, but perhaps try your luck submitting these on /r/gaming, that is perfectly acceptable.

Note: This rule doesn't affect *discussion* of individual games—ex. *Who thinks Delita was the real hero of Final Fantasy Tactics?*—only gameplay related queries. For newer releases

**2) Posting of content from your blog or website or Youtube account is encouraged

1352671360.0,1311gn,"A Technical Analysis of the ""Super Mario RPG"" Game System",Javelineer,47,11,5,"**Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars** was a game released by Square in 1996. The RPG system itself is fairly simplistic: it lacks any kind of ""skills"" such as Climb

The data I used to analyze the system is, and was usually distinct by their being dialog with the enemy before/during/after combat. The main player character, Mario, was also analyzed and used to compare to the enemies and bosses.

[Figure 1 - The Data](http://i.imgur.com/QEITg.png)

Boss monsters are highlighted in yellow.

**RPG SYSTEM BASICS**

The main system has four main character components:

* **Attack**
* **Defense**
* **Magic Attack**
* **Magic Defense**

Additionally

**EXPERIENCE POINTS**

As your character defeats monsters and challenges

[Figure 2 - Experience Points Needed vs Experience Points Given](http://i.imgur.com/w16FG.png)

As you can see in Figure 2 the amount of XP needed to attain a new level stair steps up while the overall payout from defeating monsters stays essentially the same. As expected Boss monsters give slightly more XP then normal enemies. Ideally

**COMBAT - ATTACK**

A character's ""Attack Power"" is the amount of damage dealt to an enemy. Part of the damage is nullified each attack by an enemies ""Defense Power""

&gt; For example

There is a timing mechanism in the game in which if the player presses the controller button at a specific time during the attack they can increase the amount of damage dealt somewhere between 1.5-1.7x the normal rate. This amount is only a guess on my part as I don't have the exact numbers to pin a figure down.

[Figure 3 - Player Attack vs Enemy Attack](http://i.imgur.com/OLnOJ.png)

One of the hallmarks of many Japanese RPGs is the fact that the players deal much more damage then the enemies do; but in return the enemies have orders of magnitude higher Hit Points. Figure 3 compares the amount of damage a player can deal vs what the enemies and bosses can deal. Even the bosses are no match for what Mario can deliver!

You'll notice in Figure 3

[Figure 4 - Player Magic Attack vs Enemy Magic Attack](http://i.imgur.com/PvtQv.png)

Looking at the Magical Attack abilities we once again see that the players tend to have the upper hand. Interestingly the Boss enemies did reign supreme for a short while. However this can be partially explained by the fact that the first spike is right about the time a second friendly character

**COMBAT - DEFENSE**

[Figure 5 - Player Defense vs Enemy Defense](http://i.imgur.com/AygMG.png)

Defense is the amount of damage that gets absorbed *before* it reduces the Hit Points of the receiving party. It's essentially ""armor"". In figure 5 we can see the players are no match even compared to the normal-leveled enemies. The enemies, however, that monsters do come in different strengths with some holding a lot of armor while others even less then the players themselves.

[Figure 6 - Player Magic Defense vs Enemy Magic Defense](http://i.imgur.com/cdwld.png)

Figure 6 tells a slightly different tail in which the competing parties are fairly even until after mid game when both Monsters and Bosses take the lead. This can be partially explained by the fact that in the opening of the game very little magic is used and so a defense for it is not required.

**HIT POINTS**

[Figure 7 - Player Hit Points vs Enemy Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/E9yhw.png)

This is where we see the trademark of Japanese-based RPGs. While the Player's hit points are about the same as the Monster's hit points; it's the Bosses that tend to have exponentially more HP. In Figure 7 you can see that while the player only has about 50 HP

It should be noted that the saving grace to this runaway train is that right about the same time the Boss HP exploded was the same time a secondary character, note from Figure 3 &amp; 4 that the characters can deal more damage to an enemy then they receive. 

**ATTACK VS DEFENSE**

So far I've been comparing Apples to Apples. However

[Figure 8 - Player Attack vs Monster Defense &amp; Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/u3rF8.png)

Figure 8 describes a rather beautiful relationship between the amount of damage dealt vs the amount that can be absorbed. We see that the blue line (Player Attack) never dips below the red line (Monster Defense)

As mentioned earlier the monster's stats tend to follow a wave pattern while the player characters favor a linear progression.

[Figure 9 - Player Attack vs Boss Defense &amp; Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/FhG8p.png)

Looking at how a player's attack rating stands against a Boss defense is once again dwarfed by the sheer scale of the Boss's Hit Point value.

**DEFENSE VS ATTACK**

[Figure 10 - Monster Attack vs Player Defense &amp; Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/AOFEQ.png)

Turning the tables we can look at how well a player character can take damage dealt by a monster. We see similar results as in Figure 8 where the blue line never dips below the red; which would cause the monster to deal no damage to the player!

[Figure 11 - Boss Attack vs Player Defense &amp; Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/BrmBk.png)

The results are a little more erratic when it comes to Bosses. It would seem

Please note that the results for magic attacks vs magic defenses (the player giving the attack) are

**ATTACK VS MAGIC ATTACK**

[Figure 12 - Enemy Attack vs Enemy Magic Attack](http://i.imgur.com/OgAp6.png)

Looking at the progression of the game, instead, a dip in magic attacks by normal enemies. The sudden rise in use of magic attacks by bosses can not be taken without also noticing the rise in normal attacks as well.

It would seem

**DEFENSE VS MAGIC DEFENSE**

[Figure 13 - Enemy Defense vs Enemy Magic Defense](http://i.imgur.com/Pw5zN.png)

Counter to Figure 12, there is a steep rise in magic defenses just as normal defenses take a dip. Bosses are more well-rounded and choose to increase both sets of defense.

**COINS REWARDED**

[Figure 14 - Coins Rewarded](http://i.imgur.com/eySSv.png)

Shifting gears a bit

**OVERALL STRENGTH OF PLAYERS AND MONSTERS**

[Figure 15 - Player P/T Sum vs Enemy P/T Sum](http://i.imgur.com/qjuZx.png)

When we add up the total value for both forms of Attack and both forms of Defense (or as I like to call them ""Power"" and ""Toughness"") and purposefully exclude Hit Points, though the bosses make their signature spike to the top for a bit.

[Figure 16 - Total Enemies Strength (Hit Points Omitted)](http://i.imgur.com/sii9h.png)

Figure 16 compares all of the enemies (monsters and bosses combined) in a measurement of who has more points allocated to the Attack and Defense slots. Croco

WRONG...     

After spending about 15 hours on the first playthrough I was blown away...  The voice acting is 2nd to none.  If this game would have had even a modicum of publicity it would have awards pouring out of it's ears for the voice acting alone.  The voice acting is actually quite better than many large budget blockbuster films.   

However

The heartstrings that got pulled when I learned the stories behind the wolves and P-33 (don't worry

Quite simply, MANY games and this one....  this one takes the cake.  

So...  For those that either haven't played Nier...  or even worse

I know that I can't wait until I pick up the controller to start playthrough 3...

* It has an awesome premise. I haven't played any of the other Personas so this is the first real exposure to the idea of Personas that I have gotten. Using the other sides of yourself to help you in combat? Awesome.

* The story is very intriguing. The classic mystery ""formula"" is something that I've never seen used in an JRPG (anything to this degree anyway). It really helps to get into the character's mindset because like you, but at the same time kind of nudge you and go ""hey remember people are getting murdered in our town? Maybe we should get to that"".

* Dungeon crawling. Probably my least favorite part of the game. It's nothing wrong with the Persona 4 dungeon crawling I suppose, it's just running through the same hallways 11 times and finally getting to the boss, which I understand is the appeal to some people. Again, it's not anything wrong with Persona 4, I just personally don't like dungeon crawling.

* The social aspect of it...it's awesome. I love just getting to know these characters and developing my own character so that I can further interact with others. Most of the time I don't even care if that I gained a social link level with a character

* The music. I haev to say, but they were still good nonetheless. On top of that, the music is actually very fitting and appropriate to the atmosphere of the game.

[Personally one of my favorite tracks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kInTNibjXSE&amp;list=PLewQmI19gxbqWPyFF0VXRlzPR0o5-ua_l&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video)

* Graphiacally it's nothing special because I mean..it's the PS2. In this modern age of gaming, but again get a little tiring to look at after awhile. ONe of my favorite things actually, however stupid it may sound, is the smoothe interface. Every single time that I go into the menu screen, everything just seems so sleek and....yellow.

They are a way for designers to showcase the game world and really flesh it out. There you can talk to every NPC and learn all sorts of useless gossip or helpful hints. They have some of the best music of gaming in general. They're where you want to relax and just smile. Without them

List your top 5 towns and give some reasons as to why you chose then. Would you like to live there, do you like the art? Please mark potential major spoilers :).

My top 5

The Kingdom of Zeal(Enhasa in particular) from Chrono Trigger:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsj5xjoLXtE

Wow. Is all I have to say. The cities are almost ethereal. The outdoor environments are mesmerizing to watch as the waterfalls flow off down into the clouds. It invokes a dream-like atmosphere to which you're not sure whether to be drawn to or worried about when you learn about the darker nature of the kingdom of Zeal. Regardless

Gregminster from Suikoden 1&amp;2
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCME4Wxvj4k

Where it all began for me. The music at first is just stunning with the statue as a fountain first standing out. Going around shopping and learning new stuff from NPCs. Eventually meeting Windy and Viktor..
The icing on the cake was visiting and exploring it in Suikoden 2. I was so excited when that happened that I spent an hour just checking every cranny and nook and every npc to see how it related to the original game.

Hometown from Breath of Fire 2:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqoofJNA6k

Nothing that special here. I really love this theme primarily because I can recall Breath of Fire 2 being the first RPG that I really got into and played with my father. Hometown is a generic RPG town

Tazmilly Village from Mother 3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-P1HnqR8wE

This town stands out to me as one of the most dynamic in JRPGs. It changes throughout the story due to various story developments. At the start

Arni Village from Chrono Cross

Here are my thoughts. ,adremeaux,39,10,16,"There was a booth set up at Comic Con this weekend with two stations hosting a Ni no Kuni demo, no regular fights. I played the entirety of the city scenario and 5 minutes of the world map.

First off

I skipped all of the story as

The battle system was really the core of the demo. My initial thoughts are that it feels a lot like FF 12's fighting engine. You have up to 3 party members in your group, and everyone is acting with their own AI besides whichever character you are currently controlling.

You can switch your control at will, skill, item, etc. Regular human characters seem to have a much wider variety of abilities and usage than their pet counterparts, who I think were limited to only attack, defend, and one or two spells.

The boss fight was fast and frenetic

Regular world-map fights were so simple I hardly had to do anything. The fights basically won themselves.

I think there is more complexity than I was able to see. You can move freely on the battlefield

There was nothing in the demo showing any kind of regular menu screen

Overall, or just otherwise feel very repetitive, but I guess until I play a full release it will be hard to say how simple or complex it actually is. Did anyone else try the demo or have had a chance to play the Japanese version?

Oh boy
 
From the opening scenes and music, it'll grow on me"".  I'm talking tri-hook straight through the cheek, you ain't gettin rid of me.. HOOKED.  
 
Something about the music complemented the graphics perfectly.  It felt almost 80's style cartoonish.  There was an immediate sense of bewilderment that I haven't experienced in a game since I was 11 years old.  (Final Fantasy II on SNES)  

And that's just the intro...  

I'm only 2 hours into the game and the voice acting is incredible.  I've already developed that ""bond"" with Yuri that most games take dozens of hours to create.  I'm already facepalming at some of the things that Estelle says.  As for Repede...  A dog carrying a pipe?!?  How can you NOT love that?!  

Combat is a bit tricky.  I keep wanting to hit RT to block so I'm taking more damage than I really should.  I'm still learning how to string attacks together and blocking in between.  My go-to attack is still b,b,a.  I'm sure there's a point where combat just clicks, but it's still rough around the edges for me.  

I can tell there is a big focus on crafting in this game.  At least I hope there is

Well

EDIT:  I also wanted to include the little conversations that pop up from time to time also.  They add so much flavor to the game.  I'm sure those are what have allowed the characters to take on their own personas so much earlier in Tales than in other RPG's.  They don't feel like filler,False,,t5_2quw1,False,,blackmage2,t3_uxx1v

One problem with that JRPGs is that they are not very well understood by a lot of people. Many people have played FF7 - whether they've played JRPGs or not

But we know differently. We know every little subgenre of game - we can tell the major differences between all the series

Why is this bad? Well

I'd like to create a website that essentially lists every JRPG (just this sort of list would be beneficial to the fan) but also has detailed reviews, etc. that would be useful to someone considering a purchase or play.

What I would like from you wonderful folks at r/jrpg is the following: First

It's a project I would like to take on because I think it will spread the love for the JRPG around. It'll help new players get into the genre as well as seasoned vets find the next game to play. It'll be communal - that's for sure. Reviews

It's just so sad to see a beautiful game trashed in reviews all over just because no one understands why we love JRPGs. But on the other hand, but I want more. I'm hoping to make lists like these a reality that can be easily come by. But I can't do it alone - I need brainstorming help. Then I can work on the actual site design and development, and then I'll need more help (staff and all that) eventually. And I think this is the perfect place to find that help.

Sorry for the somewhat messy post - I've been writing term papers all day and am sort of out of it on the writing side.

So needless to say video games have been pretty big to me, Nobuo Uematsu, Yasunori Mitsuda and Motoi Sakuraba. Eventually names like Koji Kondo, Yoko Shimomura and more recently, Masashi Hamamuzu have joined them up there in my brain. Game music is a big thing for me, so composers are too.

More recently though I've become more interested in some of the other folks too, Yuji Horii, Motomu Toriyama, Yoshinori Kitase, etc.

Almost all of these names are guys who have been around for a really long time, Hiroyuki Ito. So I took a look at Wikipedia, and lo and behold, this guy's resume is ridiculous.

* He directed Final Fantasy 6 and 9
* He created the original concept for not only FF7's Materia system
* ""Main battle planner"" on Final Fantasy Tactics. Not quite sure what exactly that means
* Battle designer for FF4, FF7, FF8, FF9 and FF12

Two months ago I started playing Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean for the second time (did not finish it the first time, with a very original card-based battle system and a very nice aesthetic. It is unfortunately also famous because of its horrible english dubbing, to a point where a lot of people actually played the game with voices disabled because it sucked too much. No undubbed version of the game existed as of two months ago, most likely because nobody worked enough on it to figure out everything needed for the undub.

It happens that I like reverse engineering games (trying to understand how they work, I finally finished the undub and tested it with a full playthrough of the game. There are still a few very minor issues that I did not bother to fix (for example, after a 1h boss fight and a 30min long cutscene, a single voice do not match the subtitle...) but apart from these there should be no problems.

I tested the undubbed version on emulator only but there is no reason it would not work on a modded Wii. Try it!

So, is Suikoden II!

I have posted here before, because of real life and losing all my data, that was never completed. I love Suikoden II and really hope you will stick around and watch my streams and interact! So here are some questions you might have that I will hopefully answer:

**How can I watch your stream?** A couple ways. [Here is a link directly to my stream](http://twitch.tv/overstockretro). Thanks to Adremeaux

**How often do you stream?** This answer really varies. I try to stream about 5 days a week but my schedule when I stream changes because of what is going on with real life.

**How can I know when you start streaming?** To not spam /r/JRPG this will be the only post showing when I am streaming. There are multiple ways to know when I will stream:

[You can subscribe to my YouTube where I update the feed with my plans](https://www.youtube.com/user/OverStockRetro?feature=mhee)

[You can like my Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/OverstockRetroStream)

[You can also make an account at twitch.tv and follow my stream](http://twitch.tv/overstockretro) This is one of the easiest as it will give you an email when I go live and you can find me easier on the twitch website

**Will you be getting all the stars?** Yes

**Will you load Suikoden 1 data?** Because I do not have a capture card and cannot play my hard copy of the game

**Why should I watch your stream?** I aim to interact with the people watching me and having a good time in stream. I am 27 so I am not a nasally 14 year old and I strive to also give my experiences and knowledge about the game into the streams. I am certainly not perfect but I really enjoy having people in chat and having a good time.

**How long do you stream?** I usually only stream for 2 hours per night. The only time I stream longer, I can upload the full length) to my YouTube where you can also catch up.

Whew, I'm at work for most of the day and can answer you here.

TL;DR I'm streaming Suikoden II starting tonight at 6PM EST. [Link to my stream](http://twitch.tv/overstockretro) &lt;3

Edit: I forgot one other way to find my streams. If you subscribe to /r/vgstreams I post each day when I will be going live with plenty of notice ahead of time.

You should also check out that r/ if you want to see other streams from people! It's still new and small but growing and I've tried to bring about discussion to help people there.

I'm not sure if you guys have ever played Blazblue (BB, and BB is my favorite one. Besides having an extremely well design core mechanic and a balanced rooster of characters, the BB series, unlike any other fighting game I know out there, has something that would be of great importance in the development of a JRPG: story.

Blazblue is the only fighting game I know with a genuinely good plot. The game has betrayal, and all these great elements that make a good story well fit together. Personally, I'd be really happy to see another partnership from these two companies, but this time to make a Blazblue JRPG!

1374761386.0,1j10aa,Is anyone playing Time and Eternity? Any thoughts and opinions about the game now that you have tried it?,Pikupstyks,31,7,21,"**Lets start with shipping:**

I pre-ordered the collectors edition from NIS America's website as soon as it was available. Usually NIS America takes a pretty long time to ship things out, I was very surprised about this because I am used to Amazon's bubble mailer that they send everything out in (I received SMT:4 in a bubble mailer, luckily it was not damaged at all). How was your shipping experience ? 

**Collectors content:**

* Time and Eternity Limited Edition box
* Time and Eternity for PS3
* Full-color hardcover art book
* Time and Eternity original soundtrack with jewel case
* ""Double Vision"" tear-resistant poster
* Limited Edition $64.99

I was impressed on how much we received for so little of a price. Most collectors editions are around $80-$100 for the same content that we received at a $65 price. Do you think this was a fair price? Were the contents to your liking


**Thoughts about the game:**

I had heard very little good things about this game and it was making me rethink my decision about buying it, its about a princess that can control time and has two souls that are trapped in one body. At the start of the game she is about to be married and her fiancee is killed at the alter, we do not know why this is happening nor does she. This is where the story starts, she uses her powers to go 6 months back in time to find out who is planning an attack on her wedding.

The one thing that I enjoy about the game the most is the main characters duel souls, which cuts out a lot of grinding. 

**The battle system:**

One word can describe the battle system; Easy! The game in itself is not hard at all so if you are looking for something challenging then I would probably stay away from this one. [Here is a video that describes the battle system, because so far magic has killed everything in one hit. Another thing that I find bothersome is the fact that the enemies give you little to no time to attack, they are constantly attacking and at times I feel like I am guarding or dogging the entire fight. The also adds some kind of active battle system into the game because you are constantly taking damage and giving out damage, making it seem like a real fight. Monster variety is another thing that this game lacks, they pretty much took the same enemies and re-skinned them different colors named them something else and adjusted there stats and attacks. Also when you are finished with a battle there is a pause of black screen that is bout 2 seconds long and very noticeable when returning to exploration. What are some of your dislikes and likes about the battle system ? 

**Exploration:**


I was kind of disappointed in this

**Final thoughts:**

All and all this game is really easy

1314045205.0,jqxyk,An old JRPG fan's (spoiler-free) thoughts after a few hours of Xenoblade.,lendrick,26,1,20,"First off, it's notable that at this point (after maybe five hours of gameplay), which is what I would consider to be the main selling point of these sorts of games.

First off, they're a step or two down from Xenosaga, which is interesting since Xenosaga and Xenoblade share the same spiritual predecessor).  To put it succinctly, the graphics look like they came from 10 years ago, back when JRPGs were actually good.  This is something I'm willing to accept in order to have the type of vast, open world in JRPGs that hasn't been available on the PS3 due to cost constraints (ie, why FFXIII feels like running through a bunch of really pretty hallways).

I've got high expectations for the plot, but the setting suggests the possibility of a very interesting history.  It's written and directed by the same guy who wrote Xenogears, so I have high hopes.  The game world clearly has a history (although not a lot of it has been revealed at this point), and the character conversations thus far foreshadow the possibility that the bad guys may be more complicated than they initially appear.

The music is beautiful

The game system itself is quite solid.  It's the first JRPG (in my opinion) to *successfully* make use of the last decade's MMO-inspired RPG mechanics.  Monster killing and item collection quests are quick and smooth enough that for once I don't find them annoying.  Travel to visited locations is instantaneous

In combat, even though Xenoblade is single-player.  Playing as a damage-dealing character, I have to consider how much damage I do and work that into my strategy, but I don't feel like the ""tank"" character is incompetent.  You can also switch lead characters, which I haven't really tried yet.  The various combat moves have fairly long cooldowns, and most of them work the best from a certain angle around the creature(s) you're fighting.  Hence, you find yourself maneuvering to the back or the side of the monster depending on what moves are currently available to you

Some equipment has gem slots, but don't hold me to that.

Finally, and I openly admit that I quite enjoy fanservice.  The fact that the armor is a bikini doesn't offend my morals; rather, it offends my sense of logic that someone would be running around fighting monsters in actual swimwear.  Rikku in FFX-2 has an equally revealing outfit that's not *actually a bathing suit*, and it works just fine.  Even a bikini top with long pants or a skirt or something would have been fine.  It's just silly that the bikini is the best girl armor in the starting area.  For the record, this doesn't ruin the game for me, and it's very promising that this is the only thing I have to rant about.

**The Floating Continents**
Floating continents are hardly a new idea for JRPGs. Moreover the floating island has been a motif in popular culture as well. In Final Fantasy VI the big key event in the game happens on a floating continent. I'd also argue that the *key* events in Chrono Trigger (a game also brilliantly riddled with tropes) take place in the kingdom of Zeal

**Town Exploration**
Like FFVI and many other games

**Battles**
The battle system in Baiten Kaitos is awesome. Enemies are met on the map, and luck definitely plays an ample role in the battle system. 

**Leveling**
Unlike the majority of JRPGs, but your class is improved by items gained at certain points in the storyline. Because of this, battles are generally kept fun and strategic, while boss battles can have a reasonable amount of challenge to them even if you have trained. 

  It just really seems like they made it work with Baiten Kaitos. It has the perfect balance of old and new. Come to think of it

Discuss.

1364413800.0,1b4oeo,Growing Up and Changing the Way You Play,EnkerBlues,27,5,23,"Hello

A little background on me:
I am in my mid 20s with a wife and kids, I recently got back in to full time so I could become a Programmer/Game Developer(Programmer for main job and game developer as a hobby/side job. Gotta keep the kids fed) and hope to create an awesome RPG some day.

When I was 4 in 1992

In my teenage years, there was a point where you could start really buffing up your main guy and just dominate. I've also always hated Magic, since it just didn't seem effective to watch an ultimate spell take 3 minutes to show its animation to do 9999 damage once when my main dude can inflict 9999 multi hits in like 20 seconds.

Having a wife and kids and going to school full time can really change that. I've recently been going through games I've grown up playing and trying to play them again which has proven to be surprisingly difficult because I just don't feel I have the gusto to go and find all the best stuff for my character which has led me to a little experiment: play the game how it was suppose to be played.  I have also loved the stories of RPGs and how they pull me in

For the first game in this experiment I have chosen FFX. I will not be obsessing over stuff that I miss and obsessing over grinding to make Tidus unstoppable. I will play the game how it is given to me

I am glad I decided to not continue playing games into the next gen consoles that are all about achievements and DLC. I made the choice to basically only play games when I felt games were good and not force myself to like games that only encourage to unlock achievements and such. I've been an old school snob and only play games from PS2 or before.

I challenge others to take this approach if you feel you've grown out of some games, and the way you play the game can change too.**

Let me know if you've had a similar experience or things you'd like to add!

(Will probably edit this post to add/take away things since I feel like I just ranted too much.)

First, it is worth a play through.

I'm playing through the series 1 at a time, aesthetically the game was kickass. You raise an army, make friends and enemies along the way, and had a pretty tight battle system.



Spoilers ahead


I have to admit though, was a bit cooler than running into your best friend now and then who was the enemy. 

HOWEVER, I was literally mashing buttons and following him around the screens with rage. His characterization is so brutal and so well done. 

When Nanami ""dies, they barely mention her again. I was so pissed at the enemy the whole time.

I've noticed now that I'm older, content and music... Still I find myself wanting to go back to the old FF games.

I will say, it was pretty much universally panned, I felt like a niche crowd enjoyed it (probably rightfully so), but I played it obsessively. That was the last time I came close to that 'FF feeling'. The only reason it failed to me was because at the end of the game... there wasn't really a world to keep exploring, it was simply a list of missions. It was just a very long corridor. I still enjoyed what I could though.

I'm still looking for a special game to lose myself in.

This is an interesting idea because it makes your party formation, characters could be sorted into front or back rows, which would be represented visually on the battlefield.  The characters in back receive less damage, but in exchange inflict less damage with short range weapons (or in FFII's case, are only able to inflict damage with bows or magic).

It's very rudimentary and kind of black and white, flails, what-have-you) a slight advantage and deepen strategy somewhat.

**Enemy groupings from Dragon Quest**

In Dragon Quest games, or all enemies.

However, particularly because only like enemies can be grouped together.  If the enemy groups and attack patterns were represented visually on the battlefield, it might lead to a more immersive experience, especially when range comes into play.

**Visible resistances from Paper Mario**

One of the most interesting things I've ever experienced in any RPG was how in Paper Mario, straight-forward visuals, you had to rely on your observation and knowledge of the game's mechanics to plan your attack.  For instance, flying enemies needed to be hit with a ranged or 'Jump' attack; conversely, enemies with spiked or flaming heads could not be hit with Jump attacks. 

This is a deceptively simple way to make choosing attacks more fun.  To some extent, if you're assailed by zombies, you'd need at least some prior knowledge to know the things undead enemies are typically weak against and whether or not the game you're playing breaks the mold in any way.  The idea of relying on observation and knowledge to determine an enemy's weak point means your game is automatically more visually interesting and eliminates a bit of trial and error, but on the other hand, may make it too easy. 


**Thanks for reading, they needn't be combat mechanics; story progression, character progression, ability acquisition, everything's on the table.**

Xenoblade and The Last Story are both great examples of how the genre can improve and evolve

You could make the argument that they didn't hit it out of the park financially because they were released for the Wii, and I'd bet four out of five people at your local Gamestop haven't heard of it.

When did we become a niche genre? Why is the East so averse to innovating? What happened to the Squaresoft I grew up with? I know there are exceptions to everything I'm saying here but almost none of them are anything close to notable.

I picked up Fire Emblem: Awakening and really enjoy it. I love the SRPG style of battle that these games offer. The whole planning aspect like a chess match. I see the game is getting rave reviews (9's &amp; 4.5s) everywhere. The presentation, content, value and DLC are great but there is one aspect that I see as a rather big flaw and diminishes the game for me personally.


I have not played it too heavily but from my experience on Hard

The CPU doesn't play as another commander would. They don't gang up on you, drawing them in to attack me with a poor weapon matchup, and using the support system/pair up. It feels less that I am solving the puzzle like chess does and more 'gamey' like I am just exploiting the AIs logic.

I have not played a huge number of SRPGs prior but I plan to because I do enjoy the combat system and it offers something unique over the turn-based final fantasy gameplay.

1345662429.0,ynhql,Suikoden III - Thoughts After Replaying 10 Years Later (A Review of Sorts),wuppindalsa,27,5,34,"My relationship with the Suikoden series feels like a giant game of tug-of-war. Suikoden III was my introduction into the series. I remember sitting in one of my blow off classes in high school for months looking at screens and reading up on previews and what not (RPGamer got me through that class). I remember picking the game up the second it came out, and bought the first one a few weeks later. Suikoden I-III have to be my favorite trilogy of games in my collection. I could go on forever about how IV broke my heart in disappointment and how I never finished V after finding out 20 hours in that you can miss Stars of Destiny arbitrarily

Now, I am just providing a generic number to represent my overall opinion.

Gameplay - The lifeblood of a game is in its gameplay, but I was too enamored with it to not give it a pass. The overworld map is extremely simple and pretty linear. There are no dungeons to speak of, the longest ones being three or four screens of linear corridor. The monsters are, on the whole, uninspired, boring and uninteresting. It doesn't help that the battle system is the most clunky, poorly executed thing I've ever played. Don't get me wrong, II
GRADE = 4/10

Plot and Characters - The cast of playable characters is where the entire Suikoden series shines, and the best part is seeing the best of them come back and grow. It creates a great inter-connectivity and makes the antagonist in III much more compelling. If at all possible, play them in order, collecting all 108 Stars to benefit the most from the narratives, especially III's extended epilogue. I still don't understand how the majority of 108 Stars from three games are more compelling than nearly all the 40 in Chrono Cross (all of them in the case of FF VIII in my opinion). The innovative Trinity Sight System wins my vote as the best JRPG story-telling mechanic, hands down. I love unreliable narrators and seeing scenes from different perspectives, altering your responses to character's decisions and your emotional reactions to them throughout the adventure. I also dislike silent protagonists, by extension, I actually found the antagonist's (not naming him for sake of spoilers) mission to be extremely generic and hard to follow in logical terms. I didn't feel compelled by his problem, most importantly
GRADE = 7/10

Presentation - I still enjoy Suikoden III's artwork and design decisions. By today's standards the character models are wooden and blocky, but I still love the way the character's faces change and react. I feel like the addition of voice acting has ruined JRPG plots, since there is noticeably less dialogue between characters because it is more expensive and more difficult then just typing out text. Suikoden III has plenty of interaction between all the characters, and I'm sure trying to voice 108 Stars has hindered the franchise's return to a sixth installment. 'Transcending Love' is the greatest opening cinematic since Chrono Cross, but after that the music (as most critics pointed out upon its release) was lackluster save a few select pieces. And why on earth did they think removing it during most dialogue scenes was a good idea? This issue irked me 10 years ago and it sure irks me now. GRADE = 6/10

TLDR: My opinion and perception of Suikoden III has changed pretty drastically. The characters are just as loveable, but that battle system is horrendous. For every great element of the game there is a crippling flaw that hinders it, and, while I used to give III (in connection with I and II) recommendations without reservation I can't say the game has lived up nearly as well as my initial impressions a decade ago. I'd say the series peaked at II and III was a nice conclusion to several characters before the series took a nose dive in IV. OVERALL GRADE = 6.5/10 Playable and enjoyable for fans but hardly exemplary.

Wall of text:

I decided to start playing some JRPGs again -- but I was having a hard time choosing which one to play because I was afraid of playing a game ""wrong"" and making some fatal error that would cause me to miss a character or item that I would really have wanted.

However, and Robo until I got to the Ozzie/Slash/Flea fight.  After taking a while to figure out how to beat them (I was focusing Ozzie for the first 10 minutes, lol), I was relieved -- but then had the disturbing thought: ""Why didn't I get some super treasure? Didn't they make such a big deal about a ""Flea Vest"", ""Slasher"", and ""Ozzie Pants""?""  Then it hit me, I was supposed to steal those items with that party member I hardly used with a skill I had yet to use in the game.  I was so distraught that I just turned off my game, but it still really shook me.

Then, FF9.  Now that you know I have mixed feelings about stealing, imagine my discomfort that the main character whom I always have in my party has the ability to steal from all the juicy enemies and bosses I encounter, taunting me with their flashy equipment.  Regardless, I kept playing through the game, but making sure to steal all the good items (it took me a while to realize the pattern that random encounters never have unique items to steal, so I only really had to worry about stealing from bosses).

After a couple bosses, but we JRPGer's have an appreciation for long boss battles -- an aspect of the game that is often diminished due to overleveling in order to get through dungeons with minimal use of finite MP or items.  However, that dreaded mechanic, *stealing*, was letting me get more enjoyment out of boss battles since I had to keep everyone alive while the monkey tries to get the banana from the boss.

So what do you think?  Is the stress of *MAYBE* missing a *POTENTIALLY* useful item too annoying? (especially in a game like FF9 where all your abilities come from items

I will also take this into consideration for the next game I play :)

We all get older and our values in life change. After playing through Mother 3 a few years ago, non-engaging battle systems, and cliche characters. No love, no unique substance to the story. Thing is, I really want to love this genre, I really do. But I just can't settle for mediocrity anymore. Maybe if I was able to live forever, I'd be willing to do so.

Besides the nostalgic value of Pokemon G/S/C, as well as Earthbound, which wonderfully introduced me to the world of Mother.

I've tried Radiant Historia, Super Mario RPG/TTYD, Terranigma, DQIX, FF Tactics, and many more. Didn't capture me. They varied on how fun they were, but remained decent at best.

Sure, but so did other genres.

What innovations did you see in FPSs? Fighting games? MMORPGs? Hell World of warcraft is the most popular MMORPG by far

Yet people love those games and almost no one complains that they don't innovate. 
JRPGs? The first piece of criticism you'll hear is that they don't ""innovate"" (alongside other silly stuff like emo characters and spiky hair).

And it pisses me off, moving, has good characters and a good story, who cares about innovation? I play to have fun, not to marvel at how clever the developer has been.

It's not like magic is necessarily needed until Ultimecia's Castle anyway.

The other complaint I've found is people highly reliant on GF's only

In regards to the story, unrealistic, stupid events happen, etc. I've played most FF games, including 7, 9, 10, 13, but as soon as you get that far everything seems to start to make you think 'What the HELL is going on?!' only to have the story cluster together to form a huge mind-fuck.

It just seems to me, how to draw more amounts, junctioning GF's and making them learn the best abilities, where to get the best weapons, etc) but after learning the game's mechanics it feels like it really pays off with the understanding.

Chie from Persona 4 is the most polarizing character I've ever seen.  You either love her

Lets stick with the starting few, Yukiko, and Chie.  

Each of these characters are presented in a straight-forward way.  MC is you, and Chie is the cute strong tomboy.  

As the story develops, who time and time again shows that she's not actually that cute, not actually that strong, and not really that tomboy-y.  It's like the game is keeps shouting 'HEY CHIE, YOU'RE REALLY STRONG AND INDEPENDENT!', and Chie as a character only reverberates 'H-ha, almost!'

How often do you stream? This answer really varies. I try to stream about 4-5 days a week but my schedule when I stream changes because of what is going on with real life. I generally stream on the weekdays around 7-8PM till 9-10PM. Weekends I generally stream in the afternoon. All are EST.

How can I know when you start streaming? To not spam /r/JRPG this will be the only post showing when I am streaming. There are multiple ways to know when I will stream:

[You can subscribe to my YouTube where I update the feed with my plans](http://youtube.com/overstockretro)

[You can like my Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/OverstockRetroStream)

[You can also make an account at twitch.tv and follow my stream. This is one of the easiest as it will give you an email when I go live and you can find me easier on the twitch website.](http://twitch.tv/overstockretro)

If you subscribe to /r/vgstreams I post each day when I will be going live with plenty of notice ahead of time.

**What kind of character classes will you use?** I haven't fully decided yet but I will probably have Ramza as some kind of utility character. He's a versatile character because he gets the benefit of male physical growth and female magic growth. I'll probably use a common monk/ninja hybrid late game. I'll probably have Mustadio as a chemist hybrid as he's pretty awesome there. I do plan on having some female casters early on with yin yang magic and black magic. I'll move onto summon/time magic later. I might use Cid. We'll see.

**Will you do the Deep Dungeon?** More than likely no as I really do not like that place. It's just a personal thing. I might show off some of the levels of it.

**What about Cloud?** I'll get Cloud and Reis and show them off. I've never really used either long term as Cloud requires a lot micro-management to make him even decent. 

**Will you be getting ultra rare and stealable equipment?** I highly doubt I'll be doing any stealing for rare gear. Why? I'm really anti grind where needed. If you watched my Suikoden II stream

**Why should I watch your stream?** I aim to interact with the people watching me and having a good time in stream. I am 27 so I am not a nasally 14 year old and I strive to also give my experiences and knowledge about the game into the streams. I am certainly not perfect but I really enjoy having people in chat and having a good time.

**How long do you stream?** I usually only stream for 2 hours per night. The only time I stream longer

Anyway

TL;DR I'm streaming Final Fantasy Tactics starting tonight at 8PM EST. [Link to my stream &lt;3](http://twitch.tv/overstockretro)",,t5_2quw1,False,,rydia,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/15tuna/i_finished_my_suikoden_ii_stream_and_will_be/

Unlike other people, it created a decent story but it was hindered by the atrocious voice acting (Even though it was few and far in between) and the dialogue looked like it was written by a middle schooler. 

The additions may have been fun but not being able to swap additions during battle so you have to repeat the same old attack and hear the same stupid phrase was annoying. Not only that

I love the idea of this being the Final Version of a simple jazz theme in a Persona game set in the 20s or something. Set in the 20s, and as the game goes further, the music becomes more complicated and the colors/scenery becomes clearer and brighter. Social links would remain in the stylized colors and become brighter as you advanced them. Kinda like Pleasantville, I guess. 

Just imagine a flapper party member. Imagine [these outfits](http://sensibility.com/vintageimages/1940s/images/40sblousewithskirt.jpg) and hairstyles in the proper art style. Imagine that they begin nearly monochrome, month by month, more colors emerge and the end result is almost psychadelic. What looked like a white blouse was actually covered in fantastic multicolored patterns.

The protagonist would become properly colored very shortly into the game, too. While ambient music obviously woudln't be noticed, the in-game music characters can hear and listen to on their own time would also transform. The impending threat of the big bad would be that these changes would revert, and the world would go monochrome literally and figuratively. The feeling of beating the game and seeing the entire party and all completed social links in full and vibrant color for the first time would be amazing. Seeing your unfinished social links still lacking some of their color would be really sad and drive you to do better for them in a New Game +. Stuff like that...

This may be going to far, all the time. Idle animations would be dancing. Sitting in class listening to the teacher? Every student bobbing gently in unison to the music. Walking down the street? People standing still are swaying side to side with the music, and those walking down the street are doing so jauntily and in-time. The music gets more complicated after a boss fight, and the animations become  just a little bit more stylized. By the end of the game everyone in every location at every time is full on just breaking out in dance. The class at school doesn't just rock gently back and forth, they're outright weaving around in their chairs with their arms up a little bit, and their heads knock twice left, knock twice right, then when the music gets more complex she sways a little more and bounces left and right twice to the beat, and not reclusive. She's there

I would like that. I would like this to be a whole game world centered on the idea of music and visual aesthetics and them all coming together to such degrees that as everybody in the game world grows happier and more lucid

* Interesting unique world
* Pretty good plot
* Awesome battle system
* Exploration
* Many unique enemies and good reasons to kill them
* The arts system and affinity based skill link
* The difficulty curve was solid

What disappointed me:

* The dialog is downright terrible most of the time.
* Had to use Shulk too much - I know he's the main character but having to use him against mechon (for enchant) and bosses (for shield and speed) was limiting.
* Lack of party composition options - I wish you could use 4 characters instead of 3. Because when it comes to any fight that's actually difficult, so Reyn or Dunban. And you HAVE TO use Shulk if it's going to be a really hard fight because of shield and speed and light heal. I fucking LOVED using Fiora, and liked Melia too, but when it came to any significant battle, I couldn't use them and that was a disappointment.
* Bad AI: If you controlled Melia she was a powerhouse
