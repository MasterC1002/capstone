   Treadmills are the low of human existence. People forcing themselves to run like gerbils on a wheel. Focusing their attention on the glaring screen trying to burn just a few more calories or run just one more mile. Sweating as they march to the drumbeat of pounding feet.

That isn’t to say I haven’t wasted countless tiring hours trapped on this machine of death in a stuffy twenty by twenty foot room. I can sing every one of my workout playlists on my iPod from memory. I have forced my weary lactic acid-soaked muscles to run for hours a day.

While treadmills are perfect for getting down to a perfect sickly size zero

Take a walk outside. The crisp air slices your lungs like a knife. The birds sing their infinite dance. An old man smiles and waves as he walks his small furry dog. The pine trees tickle your nose.

Walking doesn't have to be physical. Learn French and sip tea under the Eiffel Tower. Ride your bike to the grocery store and eat creamsicles in the park. Look at the big crowd of people eroding the streets of Seattle every day. Peer at every cell in your hand. Invent the word 'obular' and get all your friends to use it. Pretend you can
never fail.

Walk through the world don't run in a cave.

I spent much of my free time in elementary school rollerblading in the driveway behind my family's house. I never did anything spectacular; I just really liked spending my time rollerblading. I was really into extreme sports too back then. I couldn't jump or do tricks on a skateboard or anything, I thought I was hot shit on rollerblades back then.

I heard my school was holding a talent show and I saw this as my chance to show off my rollerblading skills.

I decided to perform in my school's talent show and here was my performance: I got up on stage and roller bladed in circles while music was playing. Then came my big finale. Being the daredevil I was

I just discovered this subreddit. Yes

However, or rebel. I never fit it, even with the misfits. I wanted to be a misfit. I loved punk. I wanted to be a punk. I wanted blue hair. My parents said hell no. The punk in me said, ""fuck authority!"" In reality, I said ""ok"" and respected their wishes. Not very punk right? 

My biggest regrets are not styling myself how I wanted and asking permission for everything. I missed my chance to be silly and develop a unique style. I'm out in the real world now where I just can't dress like an idiot any more.

Yeah. 
I joined a hate site aimed at over religious people and started a massive spam campaign on the freewebs public forums and used spoof accounts to frame someone of a massive spam attack. [You can see this for yourself here.](http://imgur.com/a/sBAF6)

[So one day I thought it would be fantastic to just take a picture and say that I was an international bounty hunter who knew how to kill everything with blood in it. Damn I was a natural born killer mang.](http://i.imgur.com/of7WSJS.jpg)

It was about then that I decided that I wanted to get into the gothic style subculture, and religious parents who sure as hell weren't going to finance a ""devilish campaign"" (My mom's words not mine.) So I stuck to wearing black cargo shorts and a studded belt and telling all my friends that I was a goth. Damn I was such a rebel. 

I also got off on taking screenshots from my totalitarian city in ""Sim City Societies."" (Which I thought was the greatest game of all time.) And putting vague not funny captions on them. 

Eventually my mom and dad caught me sneaking downstairs to use the internet at night and I was busted pretty bad. My sister also ratted on me staying up late and all. I got banned from the computer for almost 2 years. D: 

So since then I've grown up a lot. I've got a promising job lined up as a firefighter

**YOU'RE AWESOME**

Despite the huge popularity we reached in a little more than three months (would you believe it? Seems such a longer time), welcoming and *totally cute*.

That's quite an amazing achievements

Since you're this amazing we rarely had to moderate anything

So, funny, and I don't know if it happens to the rest of you but sometimes I almost miss my blunderous past when looking at your pics.

**NOW FOR THE NEWS**

We have a new moderator! A warm welcome to /u/Nordoisthebest

If you submitted something and would like to have arbitrary flair

Finally

We're a serious sub, please tag it with [h] or message us with a link (we don't want to go around stealing pics).
