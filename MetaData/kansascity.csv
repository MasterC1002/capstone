On Fridays and Saturdays it's open until at least midnight (the door says 12:00, the website says 1:00AM).  

But what really stood out to us was not just that it was a crazy, and all of it made out of locally sourced salvage, but the fact that there were people of all ages coming to just play and have fun.  It was obviously a dating destination.  Teenagers to young adults were everywhere and were just playing like kids.

Good evening. We just learned about a Google Fiber-related scam that could potentially affect you and your neighbors. We want to share what we know

There is an individual attempting to scam Kansas Citians by posing as a contractor and charging for fake tree removal and trimming services. This individual is telling homeowners that they must pay for tree removal or trimming — and if you don't pay him

This individual is not associated with Google Fiber in any way. Please do not pay him money or allow him to do work on your property. If you see him

We want to be very clear: installation of Google Fiber does not require homeowners to pay for any kind of landscaping or tree removal. Additionally

My dad has been out of a job for quite some time, since my brother doesn't currently play QB; but aspires to reach his goal to do so like Collin did. My mom's friend has a son who goes to K State who left Collin a message about signing this football. Through the greatness of man, these dudes were able to achieve this. Not only that, but apparently this ball was inside a parked car that was hit by a drunk driver. While the car was totaled, this ball somehow survived. It's an amazing Christmas gift, and my brother broke down into tears after he realized what it really was. He thought it came from a store, and as soon as my mom said no and explained he shed his tears of glory. [Here's a picture of him right before my mom said it's real](http://i.imgur.com/RjFwj.png). There's no pictures of him after since he was embarrassed and turned his back around to hide his tears

Please note that snow plow crews will be making a targeted push today

""City crews have worked their tails off around the clock to dig out from last week's near record storm. We need residents to help us finish the job ahead of this week’s storm. Please move cars off the street if you can or follow on-street parking directions. This is a serious public safety issue. Please help one another and the City

Residents who live in neighborhoods with on-street parking only should observe the following parking practice:

-On streets that run north/south

-On streets that run east/west

Should a State of Emergency be declared

Parking vehicles off-street during snow plow operations greatly enhances the ability of snow plows to remove snow, it is possible that the street will be skipped, causing a public safety hazard.

The City is taking such measures because it is absolutely imperative that emergency crews be able to access both primary and residential streets in an emergency. If snow plows are unable to clear a street due to vehicles parked in their way

Residents are asked to let their neighbors know of today’s final snow operations push and work together to make sure their street follows correct parking practices.

However, you are obligated to obey every single traffic law that those of us in cars obey. 
Example: Stop lights. When they're red
Example: Turn lanes. We use them to turn. You may not go from a center lane and proceed to cut across lanes of traffic to make your turn. 
Example: Lighting at night. We in vehicles use lights and reflectors to alert other drivers to our presence. Obviously bicycles do not have headlights

Common sense and the proper equipment can make city-cycling fun for all of us. If you don't feel that you can follow the rules

I was too shaken to ask for this guy's information, had brown hair and was perhaps 5'9"". The back of his head can be seen in two of the images with the black Hyundai.

I have seen some of you asking for another update on GRMD and figured it would be a good time to give you one. We will continue with our plan to meetup at Longview Lake Shelter #3 on June 15th. We have the shelter from 10am to Sunset; I will arrive early to get things preped for the day and would welcome others to join in. 

I have been getting offers from a number of people about different foods they will bring. I would like to ask that everyone bring something to share: chips, etc. 
If there is a need, buns. If you are interested or can help with that let me know.

If you can't attend all day

In case the of inclement weather, the event will continue to be an all ages meetup.

I just moved to a typical Hyde Park house that was converted into an upper and lower apartment. We are the first tenants since a renovation took place. Prior to the renovation TWC tells me this house was turned into a 4 plex. Cool story TWC. That's crazy you know that historic bit of information but you can't seem to give me any information regarding the LACK OF INSTALLERS WITH ANY FUCKING BRAINS working for you. 

1st install. Ladder too short. 
I call TWC because - no innernette. 
""Ladder was too short. We'll come back in x days.""
X days passes. 2nd install. Ladder too short. Because we brought the same ladder. 

Same story. I recdomend a taller ladder. They bring a taller ladder and this installer brought a vagina. Because he wouldn't walk on the roof. Apparently they don't do this. Okay. 

Call back. Reschedule. Tell them to bring a lift truck. They bring it. This guy tells me on the phone he can't install because there isn't a place to run the wire to from the pole. Oh. So the huge fucking broad side of a house doesn't have any place you could run a 1/4"" cable to?! Really?!

Today I was on hold waiting for a supervisor for 37 minutes. I got bored and wanted to pet my dog. So I hung up and called back 5 minutes later. Asked for supervisor. No supervisors in. One will call me in the AM.

So

&gt;Thank you for your recent suggestion directed to our corporate office that we locate a White Castle restaurant in your area.  We appreciate hearing from customers who enjoy our products.  We have noted your suggestion and have forwarded it to our real estate department for consideration; however

&gt;In immediate response to your inquiry, and finances its expansion solely through retained earnings. For these reasons, White Castle tends to operate within the existing Midwest and Northeast regions where all our support facilities (meat plants, bakeries, etc.) are located.  We believe in this business practice so we can provide a stable company for the more than 12,000+ employees it supports.

&gt;Due to these factors, it will be a few years before we open another new market area.   A list of our current locations can be sent to you via conventional mail upon request.

&gt;Thank you again for your interest in White Castle and its products.

&gt;Sincerely


&gt;Elizabeth Ingram
&gt;COO and President

http://no-more-glass.com/letter.pdf

&gt; Dear Mr. Glass –
First, and for keeping the Royals in Kansas City under the direction of the Trust of Mr. Kauffman. This city is grateful for the continued presence of Major League Baseball and for our once‐proud franchise here in Kansas City.

&gt; Unfortunately

&gt; This is an organization that has gone from playing for Division Championships, an entire generation of children will not even be able to say that the Royals were once good “back when I was a child,” which is the only thing I can say at this point in time.   An entire generation has been lost during your tenure. Mr. Glass, with all due respect, you have permeated a culture of losing in the Kansas City Royals organization and it cannot be overcome without new ownership.

&gt; I won’t discuss in detail the recent payroll tax fiasco,000 on a renovation instead of $75,000,000 on a new stadium because of your apparently short‐sighted views.
 
&gt; Let’s look at the facts. You purchased the team in April,000,000 and (according to Forbes Magazine) the team is now valued at $354,000,000, with a 2011 annual operating income of $28,500, so you can simply put $258, 2004, 2010)

&gt; Since 2000, Minnesota, Cleveland, Tampa Bay, Texas (Dallas), Oakland, Seattle, Cincinnati, Arizona (Phoenix), losing seasons

&gt; I apologize if this letter seems somewhat disrespectful or harsh,000 profit by selling the team to a local ownership group with a long‐term view, willing to put money back into the team to revitalize this once‐proud organization in this great city of ours for generations to come. By any measure when accounting for wins and losses, the records will show the fans have rolled up their sleeves, in the only way Kansas Citians know how, and met our commitments to the franchise we love. There is no measure that can support the same sentiment for
your records. It’s time to win again Mr. Glass. I implore you, enjoy the rest of your days with your family without the burden of team ownership, and accept our thanks for keeping the team in Kansas City.
 
&gt; Sincerely
&gt; Joseph S. Accurso

Initial Question
----------------

We pay for Turbo Pass Internet ($53.95) and Turbo Pass Internet Upgrade ($9.95). I get consistently 8 to 12 Mbps. http://www.timewarnercable.com/en/residential-home/internet/plans.html lists Turbo at up to 20 Mbps

Donald Smith
&gt; Hello! Thank you for choosing Road Runner Internet Technical Chat Support. 

My name is Donald

Donald Smith
&gt; I apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.

Donald Smith
&gt; Please give me a minute while I pull up your account.

Donald Smith
&gt; Are we still connected?

Erin_
&gt; Yes.

Erin_
&gt; You asked me to give you a minute.

Donald Smith
&gt; Yes

Donald Smith
&gt; Thank you for time and patience.

Donald Smith
&gt; I checked the status of modem and the connection

Erin_
&gt; 2 things. One: I have Turbo plus Turbo Pass Internet Upgrade

Donald Smith
&gt; Okay

Donald Smith
&gt; Erin

Erin_
&gt; standby for bill photo

Donald Smith
&gt; Normally you have RR Standard Internet plan. TWC had upgrade the services to Turbo plus Turbo Pass with out any charge

Erin_
&gt; http://imgur.com/MYZSh9t

Erin_
&gt; Here is what is advertised. http://imgur.com/jvAGHYx

Donald Smith
&gt; Okay. Let me check

Erin_
&gt; So for $54.99 I should be getting up to 20 Mbps

Donald Smith
&gt; Erin. please check the speeds now.

Donald Smith
&gt; Speed Test URL: http://www.timewarnercable.com/KansasCity/learn/hso/speedtest.html 

Erin_
&gt; ms/Mbps/Mbps - 91/14.92/2.14,2.16, 91/15.47/2.17

Erin_
&gt; It is slightly improved. First, http://imgur.com/V8wDBjg, which is up to 30 Mbps.

Donald Smith
&gt; Erin

Erin_
&gt; Holy cow. I'm not upset with you

Erin_
&gt; That means we have been paying $63.90/month for well over a year and were actually set to the package that cost $44.99/month.

Donald Smith
&gt; No

Erin_
&gt; I sent the picture. It isn't free. I have been paying for it. It is right there on the bill. Forgive me

Donald Smith
&gt; Please wait

Analyst Silvia has entered room

Analyst has left room

Silvia
&gt; Thank you for contacting Time Warner Cable eCommerce Online Sales Department home of the best TRIPLE PLAY OFFER

Analyst Donald Smith has left room

Erin_
&gt; I really hope you have access to the transcript

Silvia
&gt; Would you please provide your full address

Erin_
&gt; (address)

Silvia
&gt; I can see that you have an issue with your speed correct?

Erin_
&gt; Correct

Silvia
&gt; Just a moment

Silvia
&gt; I am almost done

Silvia
&gt; For security and company purposes, and the 4 Digit PIN Number please

Erin_
&gt; That last CSR must have really screwed up then. They didn't need it to help me. Weird. (name)

Silvia
&gt; Ok perfect in this case I can see that everything is added into the account the Turbo Pass already

Erin_
&gt; I can't understand what that means. Here is the deal. I pay this, told it was supposed to be up to 20 Mbps. Last CSR after a while told me to check again, and they were up to 14-15 Mbps. He said he has set them to up to 20 Mbps, meaning it was set below that.

Erin_
&gt; The bs part is I am supposed to, http://imgur.com/jvAGHYx, but am paying an extra $10/month for who knows what and actually getting speeds much slower, and as admitted by TWC were actually set slower. In reality I am paying appox. the same per month as this package, http://imgur.com/V8wDBjg, and getting less than half that speed.

Silvia
&gt; I undertsand

Erin_
&gt; Check what; the speed? What signal? I'm slightly confused.

Silvia
&gt; The speed.

Erin_
&gt; 93 ms / 14.06 Mbps / 2.21 Mbps

Silvia
&gt; In this case Sr. we are the online sales department and this specific issue we are not able to complete it

Silvia
&gt; Apologize the long wait

Erin_
&gt; What

Erin_
&gt; Ah ok.

Silvia
&gt; No Sr. we are the Online Sales Department.

Silvia
&gt; Is there anything else I can do for you?

Erin_
&gt; Whoa...

Erin_
&gt; Don't disconnect.

Silvia
&gt; Sure

Erin_
&gt; I have been here for over an hour and expect to

Silvia
&gt; In this case Mr./Ms (last name) it will be directly with customer service and they will assist you with everything

Erin_
&gt; Well

Silvia
&gt; Apologize for that Sr. I understand. But it will be directly with them.

Erin_
&gt; And

Silvia
&gt; 8 am  - 5 pm

Erin_
&gt; Timezone?

Silvia
&gt; yes your time zone. 8 AM - 5 PM.

Erin_
&gt; Farewell

Silvia
&gt; Once again my name is Silvia

**10am - Blue Bird Bistro**

Tucked away in the eclectic Westside neighborhood right outside downtown KC is Blue Bird Bistro.  This is one of the few restaurants in KC that truly offers a complete menu of food using fresh locally sourced ingredients.  Start the day there and treat yourself to a surprisingly light eggs benedict with a creamy hollandaise sauce drizzled over organic spinach, and did I forget the scrumptous crumbles of feta cheese found throughout the plate?  . 

**12pm - City Market (Farmer’s Market)**

After you’ve filled up on all that sweet sweet goodness at Blue Bird Bistro, the City Market hosts the region’s largest farmer’s market year round where you have your pick of fresh produce from farms throughout the area.  Pick up some fruit, cheese and some wine in preparation for our next stop.
  
But before you leave
 
**2pm - Nelson Atkins Museum**

Head down to the Nelson Atkins Museum and find a spot on the huge open space they have.  Here are some essentials: picnic blanket, meat, cheese, crackers and a kite.  Enjoy the beautiful day lounging around drinking mimosas and utilizing all that open space to fly a kite around.

1320363500.0,lzm7l,It's Official: KCIR is closing (Here's the REAL reason),the_flynn,38,9,20,"(Credit goes to a certain KC lawyer and avid racing fan. This was not written by me.)

""Let me start out by saying that the ""sale"" of the track is not a decision that the owners want to make. They are not sell-outs, than anyone here. 

In a nutshell, but there are only 3 major players who have the kind of clout around KC to force the sale of the track.

1. Claire McCaskill. She owns approximately 27 acres (I believe) in the immediate vicinity of the track. My understanding is that she has been unable to market or sell her property for a significant profit because of the proximity of her property to the race track. That might make a good motive to lean on the city to force the track out of operation. And you can't forget councilwoman Circo...who also happens to be a fundraiser for Claire McCaskill. Interesting how that works out

2. Christine Kemper. She owns one of the houses on the hill on the other side of Noland Road

3. Ms. Ulmer who owns all of the property up on the hill

Now which one(s) of these people are behind the political pressure to force the sale of the track is anyone's guess. But there is a jerk in the woodpile somewhere.

Next, but could never come up with any money. So the track entered into negotiations with another buyer (who would actually keep the track there, but would result in an infusion of cash for the track). After finding out that the current owners had found a buyer that would keep the track where it is, the city sent a letter threatening the condemnation of the land. Guess what that did to the sale of the property.

While under threat of condemnation

Then the city, ""You MUST run electricity to the new outbuilding."" Ok. Then it was, ""You have to repave the parking lot near the outbuilding"". Why? That wasn't on the approved plans? ""DO IT!"" Then it was, ""you need illuminated exit signs in the building."" Why? Those weren't on the approved plans and this is a storage shed. It's not a public building as defined by the codes. ""Do it or we'll fine you, etc, etc,""

So the city started making it clear that if the owners didn't sell, 'If you don't give us this land, we'll make your life a living hell. And if you make us go through the condemnation process, we'll make sure you are offered pennies on the dollar for the property and that after you've paid your lawyers, you'll walk away with next to nothing.""

Welcome to Kansas City politics. And you thought it was bad during the Cleaver days?

And so far, but it's paying more for the property just to shut it down NOW and to not have to find a new place. If that gives you any idea of the real motivations behind this move.

So you, could have had it even cheaper if the city would have given the owners more time and helped them find a new place. But the city would rather pay more to run a business out of town immediately. Feel free to be pissed aS fuark about that, too.

So the city will have a completely worthless

But hey

Those are about all of the details I can provide at this time. I'm waiting for the press release to be issued by the city

The track has been blackmailed, assist the owners in finding a new location for the track.

Those are the facts as I believe them to be.""",,t5_2qngc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/lzm7l/its_official_kcir_is_closing_heres_the_real_reason/

Okay, $8. That's about the same as $15 per pound and easy on the maths. Plus you get a bun included and sauce if you like! Noon to 4 Saturday May 11. I regret that I do not anticipate having any pork ready by then, and I'm not shortcutting the goodness.

Now I've been to a few aquariums.  My wife is from Philadelphia and we go to the Camden Aquarium every few years and were hoping for something closer to that scale.  Not even close... and the Camden Aquarium is cheaper.  I'm not expecting hippos or even penguins to be found anywhere in Crown Center (exhibit not actually in Crown Center by the way) but this thing was basically a large pet store.  There were some large sting rays and some small sharks but outside of that most of these things could be bought at a well stocked pet store.  

But really my complaint isn't the display or content.  It was just how small and short the thing was.  Literally 30 mins and I'm staring at the exit.  We went back through twice more just to try and squeeze our $70 out of it.  My final thoughts were this is the type of thing I would expect a mall or the Union Station to do for next to nothing if not free just to attract customers to the area.  But it was fun for 20 minutes.  If you've got more money then time then drop as much is it costs for a family of four to go to the ball park or Worlds of Fun and enjoy your lunch break.

I know that the current owners kind of pushed it to become something it's not, mostly, because there was a drag show on those nights and they blocked off the women's restroom as the queens' dressing room) on a high-revenue night.  I give them props for the expansion and decoration improvements, but sometimes I miss the smaller bar where the back room only had one pool table, there was no dance floor, there were crummy couches to sit on, and there was teal everywhere.

Anyone else familiar with the Fox?",,t5_2qngc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/1c7dlu/johnson_county_is_losing_its_only_gay_bar/
