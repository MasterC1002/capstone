**The Warriors:**
This was an interesting [2005](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Warriors_(video_game) game from Rockstar based upon the 1979 movie of the same name. Importantly, steal radios from cars and even mug individuals on the street to take their belongings. It also had a *witness system* similar to what's seen in Red Dead Redemption; eliminating a witness before he/she reached a phone booth or police officer kept your wanted level down. This witness system is supposedly implemented in some way in GTA V, as well, and it would be interesting to see muggings be a possibility, too. Plus, it let you free gang members [handcuffed/zip tied by police](http://cf.shacknews.com/shack_images/sshots/psx2/092705_warriors_1.jpg)

The Warriors, Rockstar built a great combat system that allowed players to perform strong attacks, weaker yet faster attacks, grapple moves and to interact with grapple moves. You could tackle people, pick them up, knee them, throw them through bathroom stalls, etc. It was an **amazing** improvement from Rockstar's previous hand-to-hand combat seen in things like GTA III and Vice City. The warriors even allowed combinations of moves to be used

The Warriors also instigated a *hiding system* that allowed players to hide from police rather than the simple ""fight or flight"" that many GTA gamers are used to. After being spotted by cops, and use objects such as bricks or bottles to lure police away (similar to the amazing [The Last of Us](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us)).

Also of interesting note is that The Warriors gave players the ability to *command others*. Certain demands could be voiced into the world, create mayhem, etc. Given that you will be often playing as one of three characters in GTA V, I wonder if a similar yet refined system will be used to control the others characters you *are not* playing as.

**Bully:**
This [2006](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bully_(video_game) video game did some interesting things related to Grand Theft Auto that I don't think many have considered. It was largely the first Rockstar game to implement *scheduling*. Things happened at certain times of the day, allowing players in some circumstances to schedule dates, meetings, etc. that would occur sometimes *days* later within the game. I'm curious if this will be flushed out more within GTA V. Scheduling yoga classes, meetings with the psychiatrist, etc. and the ramifications that befall one of the three lead characters when they skip these meetings would be interesting.

Bully also did something else interesting: it created *events*. Given the technology at the time, taking part in its rides and attractions. It would be interesting to see similar types of festivals pop up over Los Santos. Perhaps a game-convention in the expo center or art shows along the pier.

One of the first Rockstar games to do so, but it is also including an original soundtrack. If GTA V's original score is half as good as Bully's, we're in for a treat!

The combat system from Bully was pulled directly from The Warriors, as Jimmy could stuff people heads in toilets, throw them into lockers or trash cans, or even give them tortures such as rug-burns. As mentioned previously in ""The Warriors"" section of this article, GTA V would be smart to integrate these combat-world interactions, and may have already shown proof of doing so in [this screen-cap](http://www.thegtaplace.com/images/gtav/screencaps/trailer2_017.jpg).

Bully utilized a *reputation system* separate from a *wanted* system; that is, etc.) change based upon his actions within the world. Arguably, the system was a bit *on rails* and related mostly to story missions complete, but is interesting nonetheless. Could GTA V use this in a way for dealing with the police force? Could certain characters establish rapport related to how many kick-backs they're willing to float the officers? It's an interesting concept, and I appreciate /u/nathanplays for mentioning it!

Although the ""hiding"" system was quite sophomoric and more *cartoonish* given the theme of ""Bully""

Although I doubt Rockstar will allow Trevor, the bicycle was actually introduced previously in Rockstar's ""Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas."" However, the bicycle mechanics were slightly improved in Bully. And by ""slightly improved"", I mean that they limited bunny-hops from CJ's leaping over mountains to Jimmy Hopkin's leaping over cars. However, Bully did have bicycle statistis, changing performance of bicycles depending upon speed and the terrain you happened to be riding on. The refined bicycling in GTA V should be a blast!

On one last note, there was a chemistry teacher in ""Bully"" known as [""Mr. Watts.""](http://cdn.wikimg.net/strategywiki/images/7/74/Bully-Teachers-Watts.png) At one point in the game, Mr. Watts all but tells you that he is cooking meth. It would be hilarious and rewarding to see Trevor in GTA V have some relation to this ""Mr. Watts""; they not only look similar in appearance, but they also both....y'know, cook meth. (and I know the old vs. HD GTAs are different universes, but ""Bully"" isn't GTA, so fingers crossed)

**Rockstar Games presents Table Tennis:**
This may seem like an uneventful entry to some, wasn't necessarily the world it created or the specific features. Rather, it was the first of Rockstar's game to use the [Rockstar Advanced Game Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Advanced_Game_Engine), or ""RAGE."" This is what allows all of those working gals in [The Triangle Club](http://gta.wikia.com/The_Triangle_Club) to be so nimble. 

**Manhunt:**
This series consists of the 2003 [""Manhunt""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunt_(video_game) and the 2007 [""Manhunt 2.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunt_2) As many have pointed out from the GTA V game play video, it would be interesting to see varying levels of awareness showing upon the map given the caliber of weapon being used and if a suppressor is used. Obviously, a suppressor (""silencer"") doesn't completely eliminate sound, but rather reduces muzzle flash and slows rotation of bullets from the barrel of a gun. It would cool if GTA V took this into consideration, but it may be *too* detailed.

Many people have also expressed interest that GTA V included a more complex stealth factor. San Andreas had a fun stealth-kill system

**Red Dead Series:**
The sequel to Red Dead Revolver

Red Dead Redemption had some very well thought-out *dynamic missions* (an appreciative nod to /u/tokerdytoke for point this out). These missions were events and experiences that occurred pseudo-randomly within the open world that integrated seamlessly into the experience of just wandering the desert. Arguably, the warriors allowed you to organize some low-grade thefts and even older Grand Theft Auto games had things such as ""Rampages"" that were just located within the open-world with which players were presented. Grand Theft Auto V is sure to integrate these dynamic open-world interactions, and if they're as polished as anything within a Rockstar game, we're in for a treat.

Similar to ""Bully""

As we've seen in Trevor's initial screenshot with a billboard for [""J's Bail Bonds""](http://i.imgur.com/ESK82.jpg), but we've also heard that Michael's special ability is similar to that of Bullet time from the ""Max Payne"" series and what was used in [Red Dead Revolver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Revolver), as well. 


**Max Payne Series:**
The 3rd person shooting seen from the recent [Max Payne 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Payne_3) has been undeniably improved and implemented in GTA V. You can [see this here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMSdISbISik). Kudos to /u/riglet for posting the video initially. This is for good reason, have ever played. The series was also the first in Rockstar's game history to use [bullet time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_time#History), of which some iteration was used in the aforementioned ""Red Dead"" series and will be used as Michael's main special ability. 

**Midnight Club Series:**
The amount of vehicle customization seen in the recent GTA V game play trailer is on par with that seen in the [Midnight Club Series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Club). Many have expressed deep opinions giving vehicle handling; some expressing interest in having something *more* similar to Midnight Club


So what do you guys think? Did I miss anything? Or is there something else from you would like to see from Rockstar's history make it into the upcoming GTA V? Discuss below! If anyone has not played ""Bully"" or ""The Warriors"", *highly* recommend them. Great music, voice acting, story and gameplay.

**Image Hosts**

It has now been made so that the only accepted image hosting websites are:

-minus.com - [Click here](http://minus.com)

-imgur.com - [Click here](http://imgur.com)

Image posts which do not use these hosting sites are automatically removed by a bot. This is to help reduce the amount of image links which may go to smaller sites and become overwhelmed, and so we've chosen to simplify things and keep it to those two.

**Spoiler tags**

Information on how to use spoiler tags is in the side-bar. This is just a reminder that we are now very close the the release of GTAV

**Lost Posts**

If your post doesn't show up there is a good chance it has simply been caught in the spam filter. Just message the mods (Compose a new message and address it to /r/grandtheftautov) and we will take care of it.

**New Moderators**

Firstly

We have recently adopted the use of /u/automoderator to help minimize the work load. We've had lots of interest from people wishing to be moderators

At the moment it looks like the moderating team will be perfectly fine managing the content here

Thanks. All suggestions are welcome

**39 DAYS!!!**

**Edit** Test for spoiler tags on mobile devices:

[If you can see this without hovering over it - your app does not support spoiler tags. Please comment with details of the app you're using. Thanks.](/spoiler)

**Edit 2 - One last thing**

Please remember, too. We could remove everything we don't like...but this isn't Nazi Germany. It is up to you guys to define that grey area using the up/down arrows, and of course if you see something inappropriate, use the report button.

1369072244.0,1epfyr,Let's talk the possibilities of Prison in GTA V,Blind_3,163,23,54,"Hello everyone

I just had a thought about the possibilities of one of the characters getting locked up and having a set of missions inside the prison managing an escape.

Most open world games don't dare keep the player confined in a prison environment as some players would lose interest in continuing to play.

However with the multiple protagonists it could work very well

Hell they could even base a multiplayer mode around this concept. One or a small group of players inside the prison with a set of objectives that assist their team mates outside who can either storm the prison or find a way in and the players on the opposite team will be the guards/police defending the prison. The outside team members have to break in and escort the prisoners to safety whilst the other team tries to stop them.

Anyway I'm getting ahead of myself here

**TL;DR** Prison escapes could work with multiple protagonists.",self,t5_2t0xk,1369423904.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/1epfyr/lets_talk_the_possibilities_of_prison_in_gta_v/

If you've never played IV like this, oh look some hobos, I guess I'll go.....walk past them? Oh look a guy sitting on the bench smoking a cigar, seems like a cool guy, too bad I can't sit down with him. 

It's just a shame because NPC interactions in IV are actually quite good

For example, missing and hitting a passing taxi. A cop walking near by noticed and started chasing after me so I just ran off down the street to the diner. I ate and noticed that an NPC inside was talking crap to me and when I moved closer he started throwing punches so I left and he followed after. Another guy outside joined in on trying to hit me and I happened to pass another cop who noticed the guys and began shooting at them, killing them both but not before one of them pulled a shotgun.

i thought of a few ideas that could work

one hideout could be this trashy downtown apartment building where you enter and you find out these guys are making some serious cash off the production of cocaine. and the gun fight begins. you clear out all the enemies and destroy all the equipment that produces the cocaine. 

another could be a group of crazy kooks in the neck of the woods shooting at you. you're walking around the woods and you see a dead body nearby. you check it out and some seriously crazy dude jumps out from behind a tree and starts running towards you. then he pulls out a gun and opens fire on you.
once the guy's dead. a whole herd of these crazies run out from a couple cabins nearby and also open fire on you. 

and another one could be where you are walking around the city and  some guy runs up to you saying that gets deep with the mafia and they're hunting him down. just after he finishes talking
thinking you're with the guy



these 3 were just off the top of my head.

what about you guys?

any ideas that could work for gang hideouts in GTAV?

I loved these games to death and still play them both from time to time. But I would love to see GTAV go somewhere new and explore an environment it never has before.  
  
The idea of it being in a Washington style city really excites me. I'd love to see them explore the world of political corruption and the mega-rich. We all know that GTAV is going to be incredible
  
I know a lot of people were disappointed with GTAIV for being too boring and not having enough to do but R* did say that with the new engine and new platforms they wanted to start from scratch. I fully expect for GTAV to be a similar jump in terms of quality as GTA:VC was to GTA3.  
  
I'd love to see something new though personally. I don't want a strictly Washington based game but I'd love to see a game that focuses on the mega-rich. Previous games have touched on it but only for a few missions or so. Maybe a corrupt mayor or something but nothing ever substantial. Nothing that ever made you stop and think.

I'm honestly pretty okay with this but I'm hoping they decide to take it a bit further. I imagine it would be pretty cool if you were to acquire a wanted star or two and if you were to be arrested (which honestly doesn't happen often) you could optionally sit through the car ride while cuffed and on the way to the nearest police station have the option to somehow escape. With the character switching mechanic it would be possible to switch to another player and intercept your previous player who was arrested. From here you could cut off the cop car and take care of them quickly while grabbing your other player from the cop car and escaping the scene to lose your heat. Now this may not always seem very appealing but considering how rare it is to be arrested and to have this ""breaking your buddy out"" option I think it would add a TON of excitement.

I figured there are 75 screenshots in total so if we really focus on one every day then the game may be released by the time we get through them all (end of March) or at the very least it will be a way to kill time while waiting for new trailers/ information. 

Here's my favourite screenshot to get things started: http://i.imgur.com/ON6bZ.jpg

What I noticed:

1) Man jogging in the background
- I think he's jogging as his left arm is raised horizontally and he's wearing tacky clothing (similar to the people jogging near the beach in trailer 1) which I think illustrates that we'll have a wide variety of NPC's doing a lot of different things unlike GTAIV where they pretty much just walked around and occasionally carried things

2) Draw distance
- In other screenshots it seems at large distances they will use fog to negate the need to render things far away. In this screenshot however everything is visible and they didn't use this fog trick (only clouds in the distance)

3) Vehicle variety
- People have complained that in previous games you will get in a car and suddenly the same car is being rendered everywhere all around you. In this screenshot we have a bicycle, audi, taxi, SUV and sports cars

4) Reflection in car rear view mirror
- The car furthest to the left

And that's all I've got. Feel free to discuss or add other things you've noticed.

I was thinking that it would be cool if instead of changing the overall difficulty of the game, cops really aren't that smart. If you only get one star, they leave you alone sometimes as quickly as ten seconds. Even if you kill people, it's relatively easy to evade the police. In my idea, that could be the dumbest the police would be. 

On the other end of the spectrum, they actually take the time to try to find you over the course of a few in-game days. I was thinking that you could even see information they think they have on you; things like a composite sketch based on any witness accounts, where you were last seen (they already do this in San Andreas), what you were wearing, known associates, etc...

This level of police intelligence would obviously change the entire game

I noticed in GTA IV after setting some cars on fire and calling the firemen, I'd like to see random homes/buildings catching fire sometimes and seeing couple of fire trucks battling the blaze and then after a few days you can see the house getting rebuilt. 

Also, I tackle him and hit him and I get a star... It would be cool if the officer said thank you or something. Also, like radnom fires, random crimes, you see someone breaking in a car/home, you can call the police and look as the apprehend the criminal.

Little things like that make the game for me and I'd like to see many more than just these 2 I mentioned. It would give the game an infinite play time and it could last for ages.

Could the information have been legit? This list was compiled by user CarLuver69.

* Mountain ranges cannot be passed
* Los Santos is the only major city in the game. However, another is Tucson, both are about the size of Alderney.
* The world is definitely not going to be too small for people's tastes; Expect to see snow
* The city of Los Santos alone is larger than GTA IV combined.
Los Santos is the largest and most important city. Unlike San Andreas
* There are at least two cities apart from Los Santos which are the size of Alderney; They do not share a border with Los Santos or each other.
* The Italian Mafia will not be making an appearance this time around.
* Los Santos alone is the same size as III era San Andreas.
* The mountain ranges extend above the maximum altitude for player-controlled planes
* Los Santos alone will feature three airports (more are outside of the city)
* Ammunation will be making a return

* Every plane shown in the trailer (excluding the commercial passenger jets) is pilotable. No big planes (ex. AT-400) will be present.
* NPC Passenger jets fly higher than the vertical limit of planes piloted by the player.
* There are 5 counties in the game, with the map being over twice the size of RDR; This can be compared to New Austin and Neuvo Paraiso being one huge city, paved end to end.
* Bowling will be making a return
* ""ENEMA"" is a designer clothes label in the game
* Seasons change in-game
* Safehouses will not be customizable, boats, and planes.
* Weapons will be customizable.
* Car customization will be making a return.
* Character clothing can be changed

* The ability to drive from a desert to an area with heavy snowfall will now be possible.
* Mt. Slippery is one of the highest peaks in the game. Mt. Chiliad will not be making a return.
* One of the weapons is a remote-controlled explosive miniature truck called the ""RC Tour"".
* There will be countrysides
San Fierro and Las Venturas will not be making a return.
* The northern side of the map is bordered by the Tetas Grandes Mountain Range (the real-life equivalent being the Los Padres National Forest).
* Children of the protagonist will be present in V
* The protagonist has two children
* The protagonist is divorced
* An achievement called ""Desert Bus"" will be featured.
* The hidden packages will be 100 crazy Sasquatches that will be placed around San Andreas. They will be recognizable by their faint red glow and constant cooing.

**The counties of San Andreas are:**

* Los Angeles County --&gt; Los Santos County
* Orange County --&gt; Valais County
* San Diego County --&gt; Santa Hueso County
* San Bernardino County --&gt; Brigham County
* Ventura/Santa Barbara County --&gt; Santa Catarina County
* Riverside/Imperial County --&gt; Trecena County

There will be snow-capped mountains in game. Most of them are within Brigham County

* Attempting to boat around the mountains will result in a never ending row of mountains.
* The eastern border of the map is the Yucca Desert
* The west and south parts of the map is the Pacific ocean. 
* The southeast part of the map is the Mexican-American border
* Dogs will be in the game

* The story focuses on Mexican drug cartels, Los Illuminados.
* African-American gangs will return as the ""Families Alliance"" or even just ""The Alliance"". Their color is Black and Green. Their rivals are the Mafioso Alliance
* A Korean mob, along with the Triads and Russian mob.
* The protagonist's name is Ray, divorcee, and an ex-con from upstate Liberty. Ray moved to Los Santos recently and was served with a divorce weeks later. Due to his criminal background, this prevented him from having custody of his children, thus giving full custody to his ex-wife instead.",,False,t5_2t0xk,True

The circular zone that flashes on the map will return when cops come after you, so they won't just magically know where you are. If they have a helicopter in the sky, they'll be able to see a lot, and you'll see police use hand signals to communicate.

Also

How do you think the new system will work?

I think on one star, but be very very very limited. If you return fire, then you should get two stars with no arrests, where the police shoot to kill. If you kill a few, then you should get three stars, where it's shoot to kill and a lot of police come looking for you with helicopters. Maybe some SWAT could show up after you kill a few cops on this star. On four stars, you should have FIB and tons of police but mostly SWAT and FIB come looking or you. The fifth star should have tons of Military, and some SWAT come after you.

Game starts. 16 players spread out across the WHOLE map. Yeah motherfuckers, you are out of the game, you are shoved to another one or you're left to throw your controller to the ground in disappointment because you couldn't do better. 

Now at first glance, only when you're dead you're well... Dead. This can extend into different modes. A free roam type version where you can stay until you die, or a death match type.

I feel Max Payne 3 shitted all over GTA 4 and Liberty City Stories. Granted I did love GTA 4 and the expacs however Max Payne 3's gameplay, visual effects, ect

The subtle tears in Max's clothes/wounds he receives over time, gun sounds, gore. Others might not agree but I fuckin loved it.

With that said, at the time of playing GTA 4, I felt it was one of the greatest games I've played. I feel the same way, more so about Max Payne 3. Looking foward towards GTA V I feel it will blow away prior Rockstar Games. They weren't bullshitting when they said it was their most ambitious game yet (I feel Max Payne 3 is pretty ambitious...)

Moral of the story

What would yall wanna see incorperated into GTA V from Max Payne 3?
EDIT: I also enjoyed the difficulty, until i figured out a game plan.

This in reference to this [picture](http://images.wikia.com/gtawiki/images/3/3a/RIP_graffiti_%28GTA4%29.png).  
  
He doesn't rule out a return to the GTAIII canon but considering the interview mentions that most of the characters are dead and the wall of graffiti shows RIP messages for Tommy
  
As far as Tommy Vercetti specifically is concerned Ray Liotta has been confirmed to have not appeared in the trailer.  
http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/121/1211384p1.html - As far as I'm concerned that's enough to rule him out.  
  
As well as the fact that R* have never used the same main charcter twice in a GTA game and the evidence shown above leads me to believe that non of the old charcters will be returning
  
  
If I'm being honest I'd love to play as them again but let's be realistic here. Apart from a slight resemblance to Vercetti there's nothing to suggest that he'd make a return. It's not in Rockstar's nature to do something like that.

If they upgraded the melee combat, especially given how GTA stories normally progress. After all, a petty criminal isn't likely to be shooting thousands of rounds at people in a major city, is he? It makes sense that as the character becomes higher up in the criminal world, he might start packing more firepower, but in the early-mid stages of the game, I'd love to see a greater focus on hand to hand fighting.

It'd also provide more gameplay options; you could feasibly kill a bunch of enemies without getting the police involved

On top of this, it a) makes money much more valuable (further tying into story progression) and b) makes every shot mean something.

To me

Wouldn't it be awesome to see more realistic car/road environments?? Not only do you NOT see the same car on the same road at the same time, damage etc...

Not only that, etc... Maybe saying different area/city names on them (like real police cars) with some minor variations (for instance there's the dodge charger police cars in real life, as well as the normal ones, the SUV's etc...) but in GTA there's always the ONE type driving around (you can really only see the others if you get certain level of stars etc...). So some variation here would be cool too.

Also, or tow trucks taking away cars in parking lots etc..) - MORE real life events happening around you (like cops chasing people besides you that seldom happens, and if it does is very cookie-cutter scenario in GTA4)

And last but not least, or at least say ""oh i know where that really awesome car is"" when you want to do something fun. To put this in real life perspective it's like the dock owner has a lambo, and you can always go there to steal it. Or the ""rich guy in town x has vehicle y"" and you can always go pick it up (maybe even only have it there at certain times) but overall, just open the availability of some vehicles (more fun to find hidden cars too). And on that note, make NO vehicle ""unobtainable"". Using cheats and game hacks is so pathetic just so you can get a vehicle that's already in the game :(

First of all
Also, which means it's HUGE.

There's money on the top right screen, like how GTA IV used money all-around for pretty much level-ing.

My theory is that it's sort of a minecraft-ish feel to it. When you join a server, build homes, buy stocks, pretty much everything in single player, but the world is, just like they said, ""Online"", which makes it un-like an MMO. The reason I said, with that community. You can't bring over your stuff onto that other community


Honestly, but it was so game-changing that it's been changed to GTA Online, and compared to GTA 3. The map is so huge, but due to console limits, it'll probably be limited to 16 or 32, which also prevents it from coming close to an MMO. Not only that, but this theory seems plausible, hence


One more thing, it gave me an even more reason to think it's true, and made me excited.


**EDIT**

It seems half of you are asking for sources. If you'd really like one, and have read out every news article about it so far, which include reliable news sources. I'm just quoting what I have read, but I didn't intend to gather up all the sources because I didn't think people would ask for such.

built upon the established physics engine, Max Payne 3 built upon combat and multiplay features of the gaming experience.

We've officially been waiting for just under 2 years.

We only have 7 weeks and 1 day left.

3 menstrual cycles or something bloody and disgusting like that.

It's not long till they release that juicy multiplayer info either, every time I see a car that is mildly copied in GTA V in real life I can't help but imagine busting around the streets of Los Santos in it, or for example when I'm going through a housing estate, I wonder if there are going to be massive residential true to life areas in GTA, but all I can do is wonder and drive myself crazy with the wait.
