Mankind was a cognitohazard, basically calming shit down into something barely containable.

So the SCP opposition created the Foundation...and most of Earth. We're just 200 years old and what we think is a lonely planet in a far corner of the universe is actually all Foundation. From North to South

TL;DR: In short

Edit 1: Don't tell the Overseers they're basically D-Class.

For those of you who don't know, so please take what I have to say to heart.

Please stop creating new posts to talk about SCP-682. We don't need to hear about how one SCP can be used to contain/destroy/kill/incapacitate it. Something you think is original is, discussed, and debunked/thrown out. SCP-682 is one of the first articles, and as such, one of the most to be discussed about.

Let me put it this way. It's been around since 2008. [Here is a link to the search results when 682 pops up.](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/search:site/a/f/q/682) Pretty much 80-90% of all the results are by people trying to kill 682.

[Here's a link of the termination log.](http://www.scp-wiki.net/experiment-log-t-98816-oc108-682)

And that's just on the wiki. What about here?

Well...[here's one](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/18gx0n/question_about_scp682/). And [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/wozvf/disposing_of_scp682_using_scp093/). Oh

You can see how it can get out of hand.

Is the discussion of SCP-682 banned? No

That said, animations, etc about killing 682 will still be allowed. We're not trying to strangle creativity here, folks, just the constant stream of ""Can [INSERT SCP] kill/main/destroy/contain SCP-682?"" posts.

We did this over at the wiki

Thank you for your time

- Dr. Kens

I want to emphasize that /r/SCP is not the same as /r/wtf. There are more to SCP articles than creepy pictures. Ask any questions you have in the comments below. 

**Clarification: As long as there's at least one comment describing the SCP worthiness of the post then you're fine. It doesn't have to be written by the author

---------------------------------
We have overcome several obstacles as /r/SCP grew


Also the surge in new SCP ideas/drafts and the revival of /r/SCP_Game is amazing. Seriously

Though everyone should always remember that no matter how popular 173 and 682 are

Looking at the [statistics](http://stattit.com/r/scp/) brings me hope for the future of /r/SCP and I look forward to our next milestone. *I'm looking at you /r/starcraft_strategy!* 

-----------------



But I am curious about one thing. **How did you guys find this subreddit?**

------------------------
**For the new recruits:**

If you are new to SCP and have questions

Oh and one more thing:

***Welcome to the SCP Foundation. Enjoy your stay.***

Of course, you go over to some old soviet contacts and borrow an old nuke test bore.

Say that a current containment protocol of some Euclid with a half-dozen civilian casualties and two downed agents calls for 360 degree monitoring of a 3-acre area of forest in Manitoba, and a staff of 300 well-trained guards with Land Warrior weapon systems and a sixteen magazines of solid silver bullets.

In our less wealthy foundation, and five shifts of 24 guards- with at least one off-duty shift present at the facility at the same time as the on-duty shift is patrolling. They are armed with a pistol or rifle (personal equipment) 3 magazines of conventional ammo, and one magazine of silver bullets... plus one silver bullet carried loose as a final reserve.

After we add up the cost of food and sundries for the facility, $300k for a 12-man maintenance team, Let's throw annother mil in there for benefits, replacement, training, and bonuses, and if we assume that the land was bought outright, and it only costs $50k to pay for replacement parts... that's almost $5 million a year just to keep some unusual Canadians under control... assuming that appeasing them doesn't consume some valuable material

Why is this a good idea? Well, and promptly getting juiced up on type-B amnesiacs and thrown into town. Compare this to a hiker finding an old chain link fence, and seeing some guys in ranger outfits hiking around... but they only come around once an hour or so, so he hops the fence- he's got to see what's over there... Then, of course, all SCP ever sees is a new [redacted] on top of the big [redacted] and the patrol teams get a demotion for letting another civilian in.

After the visit, when I was walking back down these stairs, it was almost a picture perfect match (minus the actual SCP), since it was dark and there was no lighting. I was scared so witless I could not decide whether to sprint down as fast as I could, or walk down slowly ""just in case"".

----------------------------

In the early days of /r/SCP we accepted all kinds of content because the community was small. As this subreddit gained more readers, we feel that the SCP community on reddit deserves a new outlet. We have been suppressing an important group among us for far too long. Their stress and pent up tension will finally be able to gush forth into their very own community space where others who prefer alternate forms of SCP content can share their euphoric ideas. 

---------------------------------------------------------

So today we are proud to announce /r/SCPPorn !

This new subreddit will cater to the tight knit group of SCP redditors who find themselves browsing /r/SCP with only one free hand. 

The existence of SCP porn was thought to be a myth. However with so much of the internet made of porn

Now we understand that this is a controversial move

So rejoice! /r/SCPPorn will let redditors share intimate moments with their favorite fictional characters and bring a whole new level of emotional writing to the community.

I do not make idle threats. In this case, in part, to bring clarity to those things that are obscure.

With that in mind, walked away of its own accord, or suffered a discontinuity in existence; the word ""vanished"" does not clearly imply any specific effect.

Now then, displace oneself while in plain view, instantly ceasing to exist in one place and at the same moment commencing elsewhere- or perhaps nowhere. These too are features of many of our guests. Further, both of these abilities are distinct from items that merely become _invisible_, remaining tangible. Every one of these effects is dangerous, and each in very different ways.

Perhaps this seems like a trivial citation of writing style. I feel otherwise. Consider SCP-████; it is informally referred to as the Tricky Gun. I am not violating any high-level security protocols when I explain that this item is in our possession because it fires ""vanishing"" bullets- ones that _vanish_ after a very small interval of time- only sufficient to travel a handful of feet out of the barrel before the effect takes hold.

Do they become invisible, the result of some reality warper's innate attempt at survival? Or do the bullets travel a ways and then teleport, allowing the shooter to fire through solid obstacles, or bypass allies?

Entry SCP-████ does not note.

For those members of the Foundation that insist on writing about items which ""vanish"", as always, open.

Otherwise it might be damaged.

&gt;Object Class: Keter

&gt;Special Containment Procedure: Item 436-LP is to be kept on an obscure YouTube channel owned by a D-Class user. 436-RP is not to be watched for periods of longer than five minutes at a time

&gt;Description: 436-LP appears to be a low framerate recording of an independent video game playthrough. Game appears to be based on a Wiki of horror stories based on SCP-173 and others. 436-LP was indirectly discovered by Dr. Cooper who found the creator's YouTube channel, D-Class viewers were met with feelings of regret, nausea, and in some cases, a desire to never watch YouTube videos again.

&gt;Cats seem strangely adverse to 435-RP; as do most humans. Viewing the original version has now been classified as procedure 111-Montauk, this wiki was supposed to be creepy horror stories, right? That one was just gross. Anyway, watching 435-LP for extended periods of time lead to [REDACTED] and [DATA EXPUNGED]. The worst of 436-RPs affects seem to be [REDACTED]. [DATA EXPUNGED]. [REDACTED].

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1543 is currently uncontained. Three (3) Foundation digital surveillance and analysis teams have been made aware of relevant information regarding the entity's existence and/or its activity; team D21-B have been assigned to locating the entity

**Description:** SCP-1543 is a humanoid robot who appears to be sentient, apparently as a prototype for other such robots with so-called “Genuine People Personalities” technology; as such, the entity claims to feel human emotion. In particular, it continually acts in a way which would for a human be considered symptomatic of severe clinical depression, complaining of headaches, fatigue and boredom caused by lack of stimulation for its “brain the size of a planet”. To date, no other robot or device has been found presenting similar such effects or technology.

Since being released from Foundation custody during the Chaos Insurgency’s chaotic insurgency in 1924, the entity will reply with a seemingly normal hyperlink which when clicked will - despite the Foundation’s extensive layers of digital security - breach the SCP object database and reveal the Foundation’s summary report on the object.

-------------

Item #: SCP-XXXX

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-XXXX is to be contained within a 10*10*10 meter cell, who is to directly oversee the operation should a new cell be required. At no time is any form of matter to come into contact with SCP-XXXX, and as a result, any and all cells it is contained within is to be drained of all air, and to contain an absolute vacuum. Should a containment breach occur in the site currently housing SCP-XXXX, and the neutral-gravity field to fail, it is to be suspended from the ground by a carbon fiber cable 1cm in diameter, to increase the time in which there is to repair or establish a new neutral-gravity field. In order to prevent SCP-XXXX-1 reaching a separation event, and cannot be overridden by any command regarding that SCP, who are aware of the SCP Foundation.


Description: SCP-XXXX is biologically a  ██ year old Caucasian female, and given the inconclusive nature of the interview, was given Class-A amnesiacs and released afterwards. SCP-XXXX is locked in the foetal position, although this is not clear if it is due to SCP-XXXX-1 or otherwise. SCP-XXXX has not exhibited any signs of life or movement since containment, yet this again may be due to SCP-XXXX-1. When SCP-XXXX comes into direct contact with any matter whatsoever, including gasses, filaments of SCP-XXXX-1 will spread from its body onto that matter. During Experiment-XXXX-19A, and possibly deeper. Although useful information was found from Experiment-XXXX-19A

SCP-XXXX-1 is a material that fully encompasses SCP-XXXX-1, or normal matter. It is theorized that it is made up of [DATA EXPUNGED] SCP-XXXX-1 is capable of withstanding any amount of force recorded, and has not been seen to break or flex when exposed to forced of over  ███,███PSI. When SCP-XXXX is still in contact with the original point of contact with matter, filaments of SCP-XXXX-1 will continue to spread at a rate proportional to the surface area of SCP-XXXX that is in contact with matter; however when SCP-XXXX is restored to a pure vacuum, SCP-XXXX-1 will begin to retract. At full immersion in pure deuterium, 'tendrils' of SCP-XXXX-1 can spread from SCP-XXXX at a speed of approximately █m/s. SCP-XXXX-1 also blocks any and all electromagnetic radiation, and sound, all of SCP-XXXX-1 except the covering over SCP-XXXX will change drastically, if SCP-XXXX is recontained

Incident Report 19-XXXX-403A: On ██/██/████, this caused all power to be lost from the site, meaning the neutral-gravity field was temporarily shut down. As the site was made structurally unstable, portions of the floor of SCP-XXXX's cell had collapsed, meaning when SCP-XXXX fell inside, it allowed for greater surface area contact with denser material. This unfortunate coincidence resulted in the rate of expansion almost doubling what would have normally occurred, and leading to the spread of SCP-XXXX-1 over 50km, and over ██GB of satellite and other photography witnessing the event had to be destroyed

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX is to be held in testing room ███ at site ██. It is to be placed on its pedestal facing the appropriately marked wall and chair. SCP-XXXX is only to be used during testing by personnel with Level-2 security clearance or higher. Personal use of SCP-XXXX is forbidden due to the possibility of discovering something dangerous (See Testing Log). Any personnel using SCP-XXXX without authorization will be detained and reprimanded.

Testing of SCP-XXXX must be recorded at all times due to the high number of settings it has. Testing of a new setting must be brought up for review and approved by Level-3 Security Clearance or higher.

**Description:** SCP-XXXX appears to be a small digital camera that resembles a blue '[Canon](http://buzfairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Canon-SX200is.jpg)' brand camera with no identifying marks or damage. SCP-XXXX doesn't appear to require a power source

SCP-XXXX will take a picture when the circular button on the top surface is pressed. Currently

The camera seems to be able to zoom to the molecular level

The wheel next to the camera button functions as a normal settings wheel for a digital camera

When switching settings using the settings wheel, will set the area in view from the lens of the camera to a black and white tone, while other areas outside of the view of the lens remain in color. Whatever the camera sees becomes completely black and white when viewed by outside sources. Moving the camera changes the color of the area in view, and the previous area reverts to its original color scheme.

So this idea for a SCP I had was an otherwise empty containment room in Site 12 that somehow began 'rotating' through different objects. One hour a pencil. Then for the next three days

Etc. Etc. They decided to lock it up

Everyone in a command position was put on computer tracery. A week later, which over-rode the computer system and and opened the doors. It was later confirmed the Ethics committee member went missing four minutes -after- she appeared in the room and then left in a car she ordered given to her. Missing in Shanghai, China, far from Site 12. 

Everything was put on mechanicals. 

So now Site 12 is in a pickle. What if it manifests an Overseer next? Or someone's beloved Grandmother? 
 
Staffing Site 12 with socipaths is -possible- but do you want to trust the containment of entities to people who might jut let the entity out for shits and giggles? If you put a secondary monitoring station around the containment room

The increased adrenaline levels keep SCP-X-1 from being stoped by conventional doors and guards.  Tasers, stun guns and pepper spray has no effect.  If stopped, SCP-X-1 will go insane at a fast rate.  He/she will claim whatever/whomever keeping them from advancing is a demon.  After __ hours of containment,  SCP-X-1 will claim to be experiancing massive head pain.  Shortly after this point, even if the blood loss surpasses the amount of blood in the average human body. Then SCP-X-1 will die.  Autopsies have shown major brain damage

EDIT: Presented as SCP-####-J. 

Special Containment Procedures:  Each subsequently filed SCP number must be one more then the SCP proceeding it. No more 'finding an empty slot'. A gap in numbers while viewing the actual database will be sufficient to trigger the anomaly. 

Description: SCP-#### is an infohazard contained in the actual SCP database itself. Any numerical gaps will cause viewers to have a strong complusion to fill in the numbers with fictional SCPS

This inspiration has provided valuable real-world intel now used in many real SCPS. For example, wrote of several ways to contain flying mice, four of which are now in use as backup systems for seven different SCPS. 

As several Foundation personell have intimate knowledge of various memetic hazards

(This means no using SCP-#### to 'juice' your brain and get a raise. This means you

The anomaly is able to recognize job classification positions. As such, firings are not to be taken likely. Also, many firings are often fatal due to the needs of the job and the Foundation will not kill a man simply to destroy an infectious meme. 

See Case File #1: Assistant Researcher Johannseberg was removed from his position and assigned as a janitor. He did not neglect his janitorial duties in favor of writing fictional SCPS. 

This leads the Foundation to suspect SCP-#### has been created by an enemy force in order to destroy our potential. The increase in creative SCP containments is quite possibly an unintended side effect. 

(""Or simply an intended one. We've locked down [REDACTED] SCPS with the weird shit our lazy fanfiction agents came up with. Some of the groups do hate us

Addendum 1: Reasercher Addison was hired to invent new containment procedures long before SCP-#### was discovered. Under controlled conditions, she invented new breaching possibillties. Furthermore, Addison worked on four different cognitohazards and simply inventing a new escape procedure caused one of them -to- escape four 99 (ninety-nine) minutes. Fourteen people exploded.

(""The researchers who neglected to investigate just what Addison was hired to CONTAIN have been used to test the heretofore unknown exploding potential of the infohazard. They blew up real good. Let this be a warning."" - Dr. Andrews)

**Item #:** SCP-286

**Object Class:** Safe (Reclassification to Euclid pending O-5 approval)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-286 is to be isolated

No unauthorized interaction with SCP-286-1 is to be made, under appropriate testing conditions.

All instances of SCP-286-2 are to be recorded

**Description:** SCP-286 is an abandoned convienience store and pharmacy, and one corner of the building is completely caved in. A broken neon sign reads ""PHARMACY"" on the front. This, with the architectural style, indicates the building was built in the 60's.

SCP-286 displays three unique anomalies:

* The building appears clean and pristine on the interior. Structural damage appears to be intentional architectural oddities, ""I dunno. Pretty cool, huh?""

* The products in the store are not any known brand, packages were found containing [REDACTED] The origin of the substances remained unknown.

* A Caucasian male in his late 30's stands behind the counter (Hereby referred to as SCP-286-1) This man refers to himself as ""The Pharmacist"". Any damage inflicted upon him will not affect his ability to function, all bodily/mental harm vanishes. Even when killed, SCP-286-1 will be found completely repaired and standing behind the counter. SCP-286-1 is responsible for retrieving and selling instances of SCP-286-2, and only he can do this. 

SCP-286-1 will comply with any request for sale items, SCP-286-1 will enter the pharmacy ""pill room"" at the back. Attempts to follow SCP-286-1 into this room have resulted in agents exiting the front door of SCP-286.

When SCP-286-1 returns, as ""payment."" It has been found that the amount of the body that is taken directly relates to the value and rarity of the item. Common medications, like Advil and Tylenol, have been purchased for little more than a few dead skin flakes. However, upon requesting SCP-500, Dr.█████'s entire body was consumed, and SCP-286 remarked, that's not enough."" The subject then refused to take a D-Class as payment

In addition to medication, including human blood and bullets. The subject is also able to sell the bodily fluids of specific individuals. The process by which this is accomplished is unknown.

SCP-286 came to the Foundation's attention after numerous reports of teenagers 'buying' scientifically impossible drugs at an abandoned building. Foundation Agents were able to quickly acquire the building and set up a solid cover story

***~ Interview Log 286-1***

**Interviewee:** SCP-286-1

**Interviewer:** Dr. Anderson ***[If this needs to be blacked out, so I'm leaving him uncensored for now.]***

**Foreward:** *I hope to find out the subjects origin

**[Begin log at 00:00:01]**

**Dr. Anderson:** Now

**SCP-286-1:** No thank you. I can't leave my post. And please don't call me that

**Dr. Anderson:** Very well. Tell me

**SCP-286-1:** I'm the Pharmacist.

**Dr. Anderson:** Alright

**SCP-286-1:** I live here. I work here. It's a great job! I love what I do.

**Dr. Anderson:** Are you aware of the unusual properties of this building?

**SCP-286-1:** No

**Dr. Anderson:** Alright

**SCP-286-1:** I was... (Subject's expression darkens.) I don't know. I don't remember. (Subject becomes panicked and frantic.) Who am I? WHERE AM I? 

**[00.04.36] (Subject attacks Dr. Anderson
**
**[00.05.14] (Dr. Anderson is removed from the room.)**

**[End log at 00.05.20]**

**Closing Statement:** Upon reentry to the building

*That went well. We can see that

SCP-#### Is to be kept In a Thermal chamber, a drone is to approach SCP-#### and place it in a box lined with lead, from there it is to stay in a separate, recorded room approximately 20 by 20 feet, about a half mile away from the observation room, where the same drone is to preform the tests given to it by the observers.
SCP-#### Is an egg approximately 5 inches tall and 3 inches wide, the fire caused by the contact was quickly covered up as a forest fire by the Foundation. However, the egg, when approached by a living organism (It appears to classify a living organism by whether or not it has Systems within it's body, As plantlife and dead bodies will not work. How it can identify this is currently under study.) The egg will slowly heat up, causing extreme temperatures, highest recorded being about 3200 degrees Celsius. During this time, even more so than the temperature of the room would allow. Afterwords, it changed into a Pinkish color, reaching the 3200 degrees Celsius peak.)

Note From Dr. [REDACTED]

**Object Class – Safe**

**Special Containment Procedures:** All known vessels containing SCP-XXXX in a liquid state must be refrigerated at a temperature of exactly 3.44 degrees Celsius. Vessels containing solid SCP-XXXX must be stored inside of conventional pharmacy pill containers inside of a safe that is room temperature and completely dry. Refrigerators and containment safes must be locked at all times. The removal of SCP-XXXX from containment is strictly forbidden unless testing has been cleared by an O3 official. 

Instances of SCP-XXXX-1 must be tranquilized and properly restrained before transportation to site 19 the facility by aerial vehicle.  Undeveloped instances of SCP-XXXX-1 must be monitored and tracked at all times in case of spontaneous transformation. All witnesses of SCP-XXXX-1 must be treated by a Class A Amnesiac. Images or video depicting SCP-XXXX-1 are to censored proper. 

**Description:** SCP-XXXX is a collection of various drugs contained in pills, completely unregulated. The absence of regulation is speculated to be what allowed for the spread of the chemical. The chemical in question is common to all of the confiscated drugs, according to initial analysis and testing. According to studies conducted in the facility, it is chemically similar to a natural biological hormone that is found in the construction of DNA strands inside of cells. 

SCP-XXXX is relatively stable when used by the majority of the public

When SCP-XXXX-1 uses SCP-XXXX, enlargement of the metatarsals and length increases in the phalanges. Similar growth patterns occur in the humerus, radius and ulna. Cranial structure is burst outward and the head becomes longer and wider to facilitate the widening of the jaw. In advanced cases, the neck becomes extremely elongated, and hands/feet take the form of paw-like structures. The end of the spinal cord becomes a “tail” and extrudes from the pelvis. This form has radically quicker movement and possesses strength dwarfing that of a normal human body.

Instances of SCP-XXXX-1 exhibit fits of rage and extreme pain when the biological changes occur. In most cases, violent strokes or shock before the transformation is complete. Once transformed completely into the “primitive form” SCP-XXXX-1 seeks humans and kills them by means of sufficient trauma to the head, trauma to the ribcage and vital organs, decapitation, or ripping the esophagus from the neck of victims. It has been observed that [REDACTED] blood types are prioritized by SCP-XXXX-1.

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The wall containing SCP-1439 is to be kept in a standard holding cell. No special containment procedures seem to be necessary as the object is not mobile or openly hostile. Access is open to all Level 1 or higher security clearances but personnel should always be accompanied by at least one other personnel member in case of attack. Any use of D-Class personnel for experimentation should be registered with Dr.Chen. 

**Description:** SCP-1439 appears to be a white-painted cinder block wall measuring 2.5x4.2 meters. Under dormant circumstances it appears completely normal but when a living object approaches within its radius of detection a white arm up to the elbow will sprout from the wall and begin to beckon the person forward. If approached the wall will sprout more hands; at the point at which the person is within its reach the hands will begin to caress and touch the subject. As it pets the subject a male baritone voice will begin to reverberate from the concrete giggling and cooing. Over time the hands will become more aggressive

SCP-1439 was recovered from a small town 20km north of Seattle

SCP-1439 appears to show some amount of sentience, but because it’s personality is antagonistic, often using rude hand gestures and  even making faces through contortion of its hands to mock researchers. Attempts to teach SCP-1439 sign language have also failed as the only phrases it seems willing to learn are derogatory terms or rude gestures.

**Research Log for SCP-1439:**

* D-Class subject told to approach SCP-1439

* D-Class subject #95062 brought into contact with SCP-1439

* D-Class subject #29456 introduced to test chamber. #29456 had both arms but was born with a deformed hand

* Level-1 Security Clearance personnel introduced tried to engage in communication with the wall. At first no reaction was found but after 20 minutes a pair of hands emerged from the wall and began to mimic the gestures of the researcher. 

* Researcher Stevenson was brought in due to his knowledge of sign language

* Research dog “Missy.” Introduced to containment chamber. A hand emerged and beckoned Missy forward till it was in touching range at which the hands began to pet and scratch the dog. No attempt to grab or attack the animal was made and upon removing Missy SCP-1439 was seen to wave goodbye. Permission to reintroduce Missy for continued play denied.

* D-Class subject #39458 used as bait while two other personnel used the distraction to saw off a hand from the wall. Upon examination the limb was found to be made entirely of the same kind of concrete as SCP-1439 with no discernible anomalies. SCP-1439 remained dormant for the next three weeks despite attempts to rouse it; it appeared to be

* D-Class subject #78351 was introduced to containment chamber. #78351 had a tattoo on the back of his hand. Upon absorption SCP-1439 was observed

* D-Class subject #44898 was introduced to SCP-1439. At 20% absorption a retrieval team was sent in to rescue #44898. Attempt was unsuccessful as his body seemed to have fused to the concrete. #44898 was then terminated at which point fusion was ceased by SCP-1439. #44898's body requisitioned for research.

* Research request denied; Dr. Chen is not to be allowed children for testing. *Note: Come on man

**Incident Report:**

Report # 1439-1: Researcher Kent reports while interacting with SCP-1439 it stole a lighter from his pocket. Sign posted warning researchers not to keep personal effects while working with SCP-1439.

Report # 1439-2: Researcher Hastings reported KIA; while interacting with SCP-1439 Hastings became entangled. Recovery team deployed but was unsuccessful. SCP-1439 sustained damages as follows: several chips to paint on the front of the wall

this is a kinda rough idea
i do not know to to actually submit a official SCP article

**""The Blood Katana"" Hilt:**
object appears to be regular Hilt from a Japanese Katana with the actual part of the blade itself missing. the hilt is made of metal but is black in color.
in the middle of the grip of the hilt contains a blood-red crystal embedded inside with no way of removal.

the hilt contains 2 state: the active state and the dormant state. the hilt itself does not show any abnormal properties when observed or touched unless it is held in a sword-holding position as if the part of the blade is present

in it's active state, the non-existent part of the ""blade"" of the katana itself actually makes it's user feel as if it's cutting through into the 3rd parties' flesh despite not actually harming them. if user releases the hilt after stabbing a specimen, it will stay where it is stabbed in it's active state. however, it is important to note that after something is stabbed, it is impossible to remove the hilt without killing the specimen. when user tries to pull the hilt away from the 3rd party, the blood within the specimen will be all sucked up while molding into the shape of the katana's blade resulting the death of the 3rd party. result of this action leaves a completely paled body behind. autopsy proformed indicates there is not even a single cell of blood cell or plasma left in the system of the dead organism. **(#)**depending the amount of blood consumed by the sword, the blade itself can be manifest as a dagger, long sword. etc while having the katana hilt itself staying the same. **(#)**if the optimal amount of blood is achieved

blood that forms the blade stays liquid and stays in a consistent shape of a blade however they are in a unstable vibration state. the katana in this state can damage/cut anything that touches the edge of the blade. what forces keeping the blood in this shape has not been determined at this time. blood making up the part of the blade itself will continuously drip from the blade but it's whole volume will stay the same. cutting, the blood simply gets sucked into the hilt's blade hole and consumed by the Hilt itself. after effect expiration, this whole process can than be activated again by ""stabbing"" the empty hilt onto another 3rd party specimen. 

**Overtakens:**
Overtakens are individuals who have used the the weapon itself exceedingly, gradually they will become more and more quiet, talking less and less. as time passes, their psyche will slowly be consumed by the sword losing their ability to respond or think logically or emotionally on their own. eventually, they will start to indiscriminately killing anything in his/her path in order to ""feed"" the sword for more blood, however this is only a theory erected through observation on victims succumbing to this effect. it has also been theorized that, the Hilt itself contains a ""will"" or ""soul"" whose goal is to cut and take(Blood), they will not talk or respond, personality and perhaps other factors. individuals who succumb to it's grasp cannot be stopped in anyway

those who finished testing the hilt itself must be go through a mandatory supervised mental test every time carefully noting any psychological or personality changes. test results will be logged and analyzed. area used for testing must be secured

Now, so I'm asking for a little help and a review of an idea I had. Maybe it'll be a good one. 


SCP-725

The tome of knowledge

The book itself is a white, never the same count twice in a row. This appearance is only known when viewed through remote means (cameras, pictures, etc)

When viewed by a human, each person's view of the book is different and from their description, none of the books that they see have ever been printed.

With the reading of the book, but they do not look at it for a day. The next time they view it, the book has changed, to someone thing more advanced for them, the next step up of intelligence.

The idea is that the user starts to become compelled to learn more, the books shown start to become disturbing and dangerous. Like a medical doctor might start to see a book on how to analyze the human body through surgery while still alive. A psychologist might see a book on how to manipulate the minds of others through subtlety.

Eventually, but no one cares. They eventually become so entwined with the pursuit of the books knowledge, come under the control of the book, doing whatever it's pages ask.

Notable examples could be a medical doctor that ended up trying to read the entrails of several d-level subjects; a mentally retarded d-level subject eating  his own flesh to permanently prevent a slide back into retardation, who's last iteration was simply ""KILL THEM ALL"" written once on every page.

SCP-1155 ""Aftertaste"" 

Item #: SCP-1155

Object Class: Euclid                                                       [Image](http://www.tias.com/stores/jjt/pictures/aaa433a.jpg)

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1155 is to be stored in a containment locker in a 20m x 20m x 20m chamber. At no time are personnel allowed within the chamber without being properly hydrated first, the examiner can determine how long a subject can be within SCP-1155's vicinity without being effected by SCP-1155's anomalous properties.

Description: SCP-1155 is an antique crystal drinking glass of unknown origin. It was recovered from the ██████ ███ Auction House where it was claimed to have been owned by [DATA EXPUNGED].

SCP-1155 was brought to the foundation's attention after an incident during which the entire attendance at the auction, the majority being either acute dehydration or blood loss due to assorted blunt-force trauma, bite marks and lacerations, and one death by [DATA EXPUNGED].

Upon examination of the glass, are the words ""Impotable and Impossible - Kyet"" this is proposed to be the artist's signature, yet matches no currently known glassware artist. It is important to note that no country of origin is given, which could suggest that the glass was made prior to 1891, when companies were first required to provide a country of origin in their signatures.

People who drink any sort of liquid from SCP-1155 claim the taste of the liquid to be slightly sour or metallic. This is often accompanied by nausea and occasionally vomiting.

The change in taste is observed only from those who drink from SCP-1155. If the liquid inside the glass is poured to a different glass

When any person is within approxomately 10 meters of SCP-1155
during this process. While a person is within SCP-1155's area of effect and dehydrating

When a person starts to feel the usual effects of complete dehydration, now called SCP-1155-X (X being any number, as this property can effect a seemly limitless amount of people, and only seems to effect humans), when locating and consuming a drink that isn't the liquid contained within SCP-1155, will claim that the drink has a horrid aftertaste and smell similar to rotting flesh and feces. Occasionally, subjects may hallucinate changes in the liquid's texture or consistency, liquid turning into sand or ashes, and will grow worse the longer SCP-1155-X goes without drinking all of the liquid within SCP-1155. It seems possible to keep a subject alive via intravenous hydration

If the subject finds SCP-1155, repeatedly attempting or requesting to leave SCP-1155's area of effect. If the subject succeeds in leaving the area, they will immediately succumb to what is unanimously described as a ""Horrific, burning pain from every nerve in their body"". The subjects blood will appear to literally boil, causing capillaries and veins to expand and burst from steam and pressure. The subject dies shortly after this, even if they return to SCP-1155's area of effect. However, if a subject remains within SCP-1155's vicinity, but the effects of rapid dehydration will repeat in an infinite cycle.

If more than one person is within the range of SCP-1155, if multiple subjects find SCP-1155, they will become incredibly violent and primeval towards each other, using fists, teeth and nails to keep others from reaching it, regardless of prior disposition to one another and personality.

If the contents of SCP-1155 are not consumed entirely by one person

Addendum-1155-A:

A number of experiments are carried out to show SCP-1155's reaction to various changes in scenario. These experiments are carried out through usage of closed-circuit cameras.  

Subject D-9964 is exposed to SCP-1155. After becoming completely dehydrated

D-9964 reports tasting a combination of raw sewage and gasoline shortly after activation. (Considerable amount of concern is given as to how the subject knows what these things taste like). Subject is seen retching

He then claims that its all better now, which does not break the fine crystal glass. While being restrained, D-9964 breaks away from security and runs out of the chamber and falls over screaming and dies shortly after of blood loss and third degree burns. 

*Note: Okay

Experiment is repeated with subject D-9975

D-9975 immediately responds negatively when the IV is switched on

*Note: Seriously

D-9975 attempts to remove IV and fails. He is seen growing incredibly agitated and is dry heaving every few seconds. D-9975 then attempts to bite off his own arm to remove the IV from his body

Test repeated a third time. Fed up with the ignorant behavior of the D-classes, the IV system is activated. The subject is seen to immediately appear in extreme amounts of discomfort. Subject describes the taste as ""The worst possible thing I could ever imagine tasting. Like sticking my face, open-mouthed, into a pile of ground-up corpses topped in excrement."" Subject appears confused as to how he knows what that would taste like. Subject begins pacing, stopping occasionally to vomit nothing and continue pacing. After about ten minutes, subject appears frantic, pacing fast and sobbing slightly, away from the camera

SCP ""X"" is a shapeshifter, provided she has established temporal connection with said host.

It is reccomended that an EMP barrier be established between the subject and Lab personnel attempting to further research X, that is she can only communicate through dreams. Subjects must be closely monitored as they could exhibit certain undesired after-effects, such as recklessness, insanity, or suicidal tendencies, as well as hyper-arousal to stimuli.

Files recovered from Nog-po Province have described experiments with Prison Camp inmates, File 4434 was recovered partially damaged from a destroyed filing cabinet. A single breakthrough was achieved in 1997 with the aid of Iranian and Russian Scientists alongside North Korean doctors and staff. A female prisoner had her brain removed and was injected with eggs from Echinococcosis parasites, and reattached the brain, allowing her to recover. Unlike most cases of paricital infection, The body accepted the larvae. How temporal and shape shifting abilities were achieved is unknown. However, it is assumed that the parasites played a factor in this.

X has the ability to create a ""doorway"", often including Necrophilia and Morbid sexual fantasies, mainly involving the host and the parasite. Most instances end up with the subject waking up, and describing a ""burnt/rotting flesh smell"" in their noses, as well as the feeling of hopelessness and severe worthlessness. As time progresses, the mental state of the host deteriorates to a point of psychosis. At this point, X will invade the host's mind and begin to control them temporally. This can lead to undesired results and possible containment breach of the SCP.

Her head hit the seat as the car squealed, but the sirens didn’t relent. And then the noise was right behind them and the lights were in their eyes. “The hell?” He was angry, more angry, and punched the vehicle faster. Boom, behind them. The car wobbled.

The car was beside them, screeching at them. “Run, fuckers,” the radio spit again. And the car spun off the roadway. 

The car’s wheels still spun, pushing away the airbags. And then she saw him in the windshield.

“Hey!” She cried, the blood from her forehead soaking into his pant leg. 

And then a scraping noise was at her door. She turned her head slowly

Repeated usage of this new ability has an extended affect on the user, an emaciated frame, and eventually death.  
Upon death the body is consumed by fire and charred to bone

* testing with Agent ####, taking a blue-ish hue as it is being manipulated, the absorbed fire and heat can then also be discharged as blue flame projections without the loss of bio-mass or energy from the subject.

1358239171.0,16lxyn,Resubmitting my idea for SCP-1818,hunterreckoning,19,7,33,"**Item#** - 1818

**Object Class**: Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures** : Subject is to be kept in a 5x6x8 meter cell, and bookshelf. Subject is not allowed to interact with any personnel, of any rank. If subject is in a situation where his life is threatened, personnel armed with special grade noise canceling headphones, and subject is to be immediately gagged. If subject is found communicating with anyone, subject is to be gagged and moved to a 1.5x1.5x2 meter sound proofed iron cell for protection against instances of SCP-1818b. Subject is not under any circumstances allowed to be given access to computers, pen and paper, or telephones.  

**Description** : Subject is a caucasian male, with a weight of approximately 95.25kgs. Subject has black hair, and grey eyes. Subject’s only noticeable difference than that of an average human, his a very noticeably grey pigmentation covering his entire body. Subject has an average intelligence, and completely regular brainwaves, until encounter with any humans who are to become an instance of SCP-1818a. 
SCP-1818’s ability has been observed to have a telepathic effect on those he initiates in communication with, and social in this state, wishing to converse for very long periods of time. This amount of time had been measured from a range of One (1) hour to Fifteen (15) hours. Once encounter is over, SCP-1818 goes into a hibernation period, equal to the length of the aforementioned conversation.
Once the conversation is concluded, very noticeably more enjoyable, and optimistic. Effect is also noticeably more effective towards those who are suffering from loneliness, or who are severely depressed.
After anywhere from Twelve (12) to Thirty-Six (36) hours after first exposure, coinciding with SCP-1818’s awakening. If SCP-1818a is denied access to SCP-1818, SCP-1818a has been observed to “appear” wherever SCP-1818 is. Is is not known how this occurs. It has been speculated that it’s a point to point teleportation, while other researchers believe SCP-1818a might slip into another dimension, then reappear at the location.When the second encounter occurs, SCP-1818a will act as though they are good friends. When SCP-1818a is re-introduced, they are to be reclassified as SCP-1818b. 
It has been observed that SCP-1818 has absolutely no recollection of any events 48 hours prior to his awakening from hibernation. Upon learning this fact

* 39% of instances of SCP-1818b have been known to slip into a deep and severe depression
* 40% of the instances will become extraordinarily violent
* 21% of the instances will [DATA EXPUNGED] immediately

Attempts have been made to administer amnesiacs to SCP-1818a and 1818b

SCP-1818, no matter where he is located, has been observed to grow noticeably happier, and very eager to socialize with others.

It is also worth noting, but only if there is a verbal or written response.

**Addendum** : Subject was retrieved after The Foundation was notified of a very large number of suicides and strange occurrences among the population of ██████ High School in the town of █████, stating that there had been a mass shooting, leaving hundreds dead, seemingly coordinated by a group of five (5) students who had all come into contact with SCP-1818. Upon arrival of a group of seven (7) agents, the east wing of the structure [DATA EXPUNGED], leaving no survivors inside the building, apart from SCP-1818, and taken into foundation custody immediately.

**Object Class:** Elucid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX as of ███████ ██, chicken and nuts. Water is to be given to SCP-XXXX every hour. 

No verbal interaction is to occur with SCP-XXXX unless you are authorized by Doctor ██████to do so. Two guards are to stand by the doors at all times and switch after every twelve hours. The guards never remain the same and new ones are brought every six months (As of now we are sure that is how long it takes before SCP-XXXX can have an effect on non-verbal prey. To prevent temptation to communicate with SCP-XXXX

Authorized personnel are not to enter the room where SCP-XXXX resides and are to communicate with it through the sliding door at the top that is usually locked and the key is in the hands of Doctor ███████. No copies are to be made of this key

While talking to SCP-XXXX

*[NEW] To all personnel that are authorized to speak to SCP-XXXX

*[NEW] Those of you who wonder why your proposals are shot down: You may or may not have already had contact with SCP-XXXX and had your memory wiped for your own safety. You will not be told if this is the case

**Description:** SCP-XXXX stands about 1.5 meters tall and has the appearance of a brown bear. It walks on two feet and has mannerisms of a human though does not enjoy cooked food. Attempts to see if SCP-XXXX would survive without food ended with it becoming tired

Its right eye is a honey color while the left is blue

Upon looking at SCP-XXXX

Anything that SCP-XXXX asks of the person will seem like a small favor compared to what they ‘owe’ it. At first it would only ask personnel for a hug and even just for extra servings of food and for honey to be added to its diet. Honey seemed to make it shake and go into a manic state of mind
SCP-XXXX recently has asked personnel to hurt themselves. 

Personnel used any items in their possession to cause harm to them in a deadly manor. SCP-XXXX has asked some personnel to kill the guards so it could get some exercise

It seems to only have effect on those that make eye contact with it

Guards who have been near SCP-XXXX without verbal contact and seeing it have refused food and water. Twelve hours after refusing food and water the guards were found dead from malnutrition and dehydration as if they had gone without for months even if they had eaten the day before. (To our knowledge this only happens after seven months.)

*[NEW] SCP-XXXX has been asking for baths lately

**Addendum:** SCP-XXXX has recently become very demanding and at times reverts back into acting like a bear. This proved to be a show it put on for us to put it into the wild. Do not fall for it and ignore this

After the most recent interview with SCP-XXXX

**Document #XXX-1: Interview 1**

**SCP-XXXX:** Thank you for coming to see me

**Doctor ███████:** You know I can’t do that for you. 

**SCP-XXXX:** But

**Doctor ███████:** I—I …I’m sorry. 

**SCP-XXXX:** I know

**Doctor ███████:** I’m so sorry

**SCP-XXXX:** Can I just go out and walk? 

**Doctor ███████:** O-Of course you can! Anything

*[Doctor ███████ proceeded to attempt to open up SCP-XXXX’s door and had to be restrained and tranquilized. Doctor ███████ continued to insist after waking up that they owed it to SCP-XXXX to help it. After 48 hours Doctor ███████ returned to normal and had no recollection of anything after telling SCP-XXXX it could not be let out.]*",self,t5_2r4ni,False,,safe,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/wrqz3/worked_on_a_new_idea_for_an_scp_this_morning/

Thoughts?

Edit: I've rewritten parts of the entry using the suggestions in the first comments.

**Item #:** SCP-1362

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**

Ambulatory instances of SCP-1362-1 are to be terminated on sight. Pregnant women in the 50 km vicinity of the sighting are to be monitored

If larval instances of SCP-1362-1 are found in hosts younger than 13 years, civilian surgeons can be briefed on the details of SCP-1362. These surgeons should be given class-A amnesiacs after the operation and should be fed standard cover story 1362-B^2 .

Larval instances of SCP-1362-1 in hosts older than 13 years are to be killed with radiation therapy on the host. X-ray images should be destroyed

Male infants killed by SCP-1362-1 should be replaced with a replica made with SCP-604. Class-A amnesiacs should be administered to everyone who knows about the exact circumstances of the child's death

Instances of SCP-1362-3 are to be terminated in infancy. They should be prevented from reaching sexual maturity at all costs. MTF Pi-12 (""Population Control"") is tasked with the examination of reports of sexually mature SCP-1362-3 instances. If an instance of SCP-1362-3 has impregnated a woman

Over 100 instances of SCP-1362-1 in a city in an 1-year period should be considered an outbreak. In this case procedure 243-Solomon should be executed.

Several instances of SCP-1362-1 and SCP-1362-2 are stored in vacuum-sealed cryogenic storage units. Anyone with at least level 2 clearance can request samples for examination from Dr. ████████. 

**Description:**

SCP-1362 is a parasite that reproduces primarily by disguising itself as a fetus-in-fetu and secondarily by taking over the reproductive organs of a male human.

SCP-1362-1 is a bipedal animal measuring 12-27 cm in length. It exists in two states: a parasitic larval state and an ambulatory breeder state. Its general body shape is similar to a human fetus with two large claws in place of its hands. Its exoskeleton is composed of bone

SCP-1362-1 enters the host in the host's fetal state and lives as a parasite. In males, it starts secreting a toxin that causes extreme promiscuity in the hosts. The hosts will attempt to engage in unprotected coitus with as many men as they can. They don't respond to contraceptives and there are recorded instances of SCP-1362 causing latex allergy. SCP-1362-1 has an average lifespan of 34 years. If the host survives the parasite, SCP-1362-1 dies and its body becomes absorbed. The psychological symptoms disappear in 3 to 9 months.

Upon the expiration of the host, infection in these cases is usually unsuccessful.

If a female host is impregnated, SCP-1362-3 instances emit powerful pheromones making them more attractive to females. They also have an increased libido and a strong aversion to contraceptives. Castration, gelding or vasectomy preformed on instances of SCP-1362-3 is ineffective as these body parts always regenerate. Women impregnated by an instance of SCP-1362-3 will develop symptoms similar to a common cold. Instead of rhinovirus, however, they will spread instances of SCP-1362-2. The embryo itself is another instance of SCP-1362-3. Because of the high infectivity and the effect SCP-1362-1 has on humans, SCP-1362-3 instances have to be terminated before reaching sexual maturity.

**History**:

SCP-1362 got the Foundation's attention after the deaths of 17 male infants in the village of █████████, the angry spirit of the dead child appearing in the village after the death of every infant. Examination of the village lead to the agents encountering the carcasses of several SCP-1362-1 instances. This prompted the Foundation to send a complete medical contingent to the village.

The contingent examined the surviving male infants and determined that they were all instances of SCP-1362-3. The village was immediately quarantined, amnesiacs were administered and a cover story was created about a viral infection.

After extensive examinations (resulting in the death of 3 of the 5 detained SCP-1362-3 instances)

1: parasitic twin

2: leaking anaesthetic gas after the successful removal of the parasitic twin

3: malignant tumor requiring radiation therapy before removal

4: leaking anaesthetic gas after the successful removal of the tumor

5: SIDS

6: fetus endangering the mother's life

**Story**
The story is still under heavy development

**Gameplay**
The game will be set up as a first-person game, although I am not sure what they will be. I am thinking of a system similar to the one in Bioshock, where researching SCPs will help you fight against them, contain them, and create better equipment.

Those are the main features I plan on implementing if this idea becomes popular. I also plan on working with the community to create the most accurate representation of the locations, I plan on using Cryengine 3 to create the game.

Hope you guys like the idea!

**Special Containment Procedures:** Source codes for SCP-XXX-P instances that are deemed worthy of further analysis and binaries of SCP-XXX-C instances are to be kept on Secure Foundation Server XXX at Site-18. A database of SCP-XXX-L features discovered so far is to be kept on the Foundation intranet.

**Description:** SCP-XXX is an anomalous library to the C++ programming language. SCP-XXX-L is the designation of the library itself (called EmC), programs compiled this way don't show any anomalous properties) and SCP-XXX-P is the collective designations for programs written using SCP-XXX-L. When a C++ program is compiled with SCP-XXX-C without including SCP-XXX-L's header file it shows no anomalous properties. These properties only manifest if SCP-XXX-L's header is included and the compiled binaries of SCP-XXX-L (EmC.dll or EmC.so) can be found on the system.

Functions found in SCP-XXX-L are used to access and alter the emotional state of the computer running the program. As SCP-XXX-L lacks a proper documentation, that the majority of the emotional states can't be set directly and a direct change in emotional state issued by invoking the setMood() function can be refused throwing an exception (especially if said change would constitute an extreme mood swing).

It is also discovered that not every computer is capable of using the full range of discovered emotions. As a rule of thumb, ""angry"", ""sad"", ""happy"", ""excited"", ""neutral""), whereas the most sophisticated example of SCP-XXX-P encountered (SCP-XXX-P1267, ""inspired"" or ""zestful"".

During experimentation

Extract from Addendum SCP-XXX-A1:

|Designation | Can be set directly?^1 | Minimal complexity required | Effect |
|:------|:------|:------|:------|
|Neutral|Yes|Any CPU|Computers in neutral mood perform as expected
|Happy|Yes|8-bit CPU|Calculations are performed faster (with a factor of 2-3)
|Sad|Yes|8-bit CPU|Calculations are performed slower (with a factor of 2-3). If it persists and the computer is complex enough
|Angry|No|8-bit CPU|Calculations are performed faster
|Excited|No|8-bit CPU|Usually a result of the program approaching the end of a cycle with a large number (&gt;10^5 ) of iterations. Calculations are performed faster and accurately. If the next instructions are sufficiently different from the ones in the cycle, it will enter into a ""neutral"" mode.
|Scared|No|8-bit CPU|Usually a result of unexpected input or slight hardware issues (fluctuation in the power supply, if the computer is complex enough, ""relieved"")
|Annoyed|No|16-bit CPU|Usually a result of frequent interrupts. The computer might start to ignore some of these interrupts. If interrupts continue
|Lonely|No|16-bit CPU|Results if an SCP-XXX-P is the only program running on a computer without user input. Identical to ""neutral""
|Proud|No|32-bit CPU|Results if the computer output a large amount of information. The next few operations will be performed faster
|Guilty|No|32-bit CPU|Results if the program has caused inconvenience or errors to other programs (timeouts, but the computer will enter into ""neutral"" mode after 2^64 cycles.
|Depressed|No|32-bit CPU|A computer usually enters into a ""depressed"" state if a ""sad"" state persists for more than 2^32 cycles. In this state its speed slows down even more than in the ""sad"" mood (with a factor of 8-10) and an error with σ=1 is introduced. The computer might refuse to perform some operations.
|Flow|No|64-bit CPU, SSD or similarly fast storage medium|It's unknown what causes ""flow"" state, but it usually occurs when the computer performs similar memory and CPU-consuming (&gt;75% of average load) tasks in a row and it's in a neutral or happy mood. The processing speed of tasks similar to what caused the flow shows a significant (a factor of 64-128) increase. It's unknown where the resulting processing power comes from as the heat output of the CPU doesn't show an increase consistent with overclocking. After a ""flow"", the computer will inevitably enter into a ""proud"" state.
|Suicidal|No|64-bit CPU, it usually takes time.
|Inspired|No|Unknown
|Zestful|No|Unknown, if the computer performs simple calculations in a ""zestful"" mood, it might transition into ""bored"".
|Heartbroken|No|Unknown, the source code of SCP-XXX-P1267 calls for excessive interaction with other programs, computers and users in case of the ""heartbroken"" state. Note: it implies that there's an ""in love"", or at least an ""infatuated"" state, but no reference to these has been found.

SCP-XXX: The Pharmacy 

Classification: Safe (Promotion to Euclid pending O5 approval)

Containment Procedures: SCP-XXX is to be guarded by at least two Agents at all times, and accessible to any researcher with prior approval for testing.

Description: SCP-XXX is a small convenience store and pharmacy located at ████████, parts of the neon ""PHARMACY"" sign that remain indicate the building was built in the 1960s. 

SCP-XXX possesses several anomalous properties:

Firstly, but after investigation into the corner in which the outside collapsed, it was determined that the interior of SCP-XXX may exist in another bubble-universe. This property is only experienced when entering SCP-XXX through the front door. The interior remains broken and abandoned when entering through one of the many flaws and structural breaks on the exterior.

Secondly

The most prevalent anomaly is in the pharmacy section. A Caucasian male (hereby reffered to as SCP-XXX-1) stands behind the desk. The man has a happy demeanor

Upon request for a medication or perscription, with the room being abandoned and in disrepair upon entry. SCP-XXX-1 will then approach the desk and sell the product (refferred to as SCP-XXX-2). 

SCP-XXX-1 has been able to successfully retreive any medication requested so far. He is also able to produce non-medical substances, like bullets. SCP-XXX-1 cannot produce any substance that cannot fit in a pill bottle. 

[Here I plan on making a test log. Pretty ""normal"" stuff, ""God have mercy on your souls"", and retreats into his pill room. Upon exiting, he appears to have no memory of the previous events. I also plan on having an interview log with SCP-XXX-1.]

Some other ideas I've had:

[This](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/document-19-v-1911854/strux.jpg). It's a spacial anomaly: From outside looking in, subjects vanish once they're out of sight, even for a moment. Subjects are obviously never found, but recording devices and livestreaming cameras function properly. Subjects report seeing shadowy figures hunting them.

Haven't found an appropriate picture, a D-class with a telephone surgically implanted in his skull, or a porcupine with knife quills. All objects can function properly.

On the first day, I saw her, rising into the sky over the treetops of her misty valley, turning great rotations in the air, the massive spiral of life itself. I was afraid of her at first. I do not know why.
It was then that I first met one of US THEM no us THEM THEY KILLED US the purge I WILL SERVE they were like me, not like me. Like us. They had my spotted pelt and slitted eyes, but they walked on two legs like the Great Ones. At first I did not want to serve Mother, and I tried to escape MOTHER no MOTHER not not MOTHER I WILL NOT but they dragged me back to Mother. And she made me right.

On the second day, and my face was as flat as a Great One's. I first saw Mother with all those she had newly made right GREAT ONES NO MoTHeR no in her chamber at the top of herself. The room was massive, towering high over our heads. Mother sat at one corner, writing a manuscript, the thousands of parts of her body all pulsing in tandem, forming the words. She taught us to write, to form words of our own. She told us to keep journals written so as to learn as we grow. And so we did.

On the third day, that flew. We made all of them right.
	I met one of us that I liked. Her name was Athena. We spoke about hunting

On the fourth day, she said. Hunting Them and making Them into us. Making Them rightINSTINCT for the Great Ones.
I went down into the world, where Mother's many hands molded their bodies into the proper shape: tall and thin, and with no wings. They went through a series of half-circles, which encased their body in a second skeleton made of metal and tore off their beaks, giving them instead mouths like the Great Ones.
After this, so I must make do.

On the fifth day

On the sixth day, in Mother's very deepest reaches to chip at rocks. Metal crisscrossed the walls down there, in what Mother called veins. When the day's work was done, we'd chipped away many silver-lined stones.
After I'd finished in the mines, called the Library. Mother said it was full of works she'd penned, so we would see what kind of world we'd make for the Great Ones if we stayed the course on our mission. We were free to take any of the manuscripts to our place of rest to read at our own pace. My favorite is titled The Entropy of Nature. It is about a young man named Thomas who faces adversity but overcomes it. I like it because I can almost imagine myself as Thomas. I read until it was the seventh day.

On the seventh day
""It excites me, now.""
I am becoming more comfortable walking on two legs.
We didn't find any leopards today. Athena was disappointed.

On the eighth day, in my mind, a small, cozy place with books stacked on shelves to the ceiling and a crackling fire burning in a fireplace. Mother's library was the second-largest room inside her. The shelves were stacked to the ceiling, maybe a thousand miles into the air, rising into the darkness out of my field of vision.
I climbed the ladders and catwalks to the highest of shelves, some are simple outlines of Mother's design schematics.
At the very highest shelf, by J.R.R. Tolkein, and brought it to my place of rest to read.
At first, however, as the plot of the story intrigues me.

Mother read my journal
Mother also told me she was glad I was reading The Fellowship of the Ring
I went hunting again with Athena and our group
She said she was pleased to serve Mother in such a fashion. I told her to think of what she did
When we returned to Mother, it looked at me. As its beak was pulled off, it looked at me. As blood gushed out of its mouth, it looked at me. I returned to my place of rest and finished The Fellowship of the Ring.

On the tenth day, I suppose. I gave her The Fellowship of the Ring. She said she'd enjoy it, but she had a hard time relating to anyone in it. I told her to think of Mother as Saruman, commanding an unnatural army from her tower of Orthanc.

**Description:** ""Ray cannon"" confiscated from Prometheus Labs. 1.5 m in length, though the anomalous particle source inside emits unknown particles instead of electrons (apparently with an electric charge, or the superconductive magnets would have no effect). The superconducting magnets might be replaced without affecting the functionality.

The particle source appears to be a coil possessing a fractal geometry, thus it can be transported with SCP-120 if necessary.

When fired, causing it to ""skip"" half of the distance. Due to its effects, these phases are theorized to be the dark energy equivalent of electric and magnetic fields.

Protons and electrons touched by this beam are converted into a matter that's apparently between normal and dark matter. This conversion seems to be taking away energy from the beam and only occurs at points where the energy of the ""dark electric"" and ""dark magnetic"" fields are nearly equal and their sum is above a certain threshold

**Description:** SCP-XXXX is a medium sized spiraling statue made from stone, any attempts to make sound will be ineffective. This field ranges from the base of the object to the walls of whatever room it is in. If placed outside the effect is limited to up to 10 feet. When exposed to SCP-XXXX for even a short amount of time, subjects enter an almost catatonic state. Subjects will refuse to talk, eat, sleep or drink and will do nothing but create replicas of SCP-XXXX from whatever material is available.  
  
So far any attempt to snap an affected person out of this state has proven futile, loud static and phrases repeated like a mantra including ""CREATE"" and ""MARK OUR MEMORY"". Initial recovery began when reports of a young man being hospitilised in [DATA EXPUNGED] after refusing to eat or sleep, choosing instead to make hundreds of copies of SCP-XXXX.  
  
Upon investigation of the local area, once the effects of SCP-XXXX were apparent it was removed from the site immediately.

[Terminal effects of SCP ####-2](http://www.jessicaharrison.co.uk/USERIMAGES/Jharrison_Skull3.jpg)

**Object Number:** SCP ####
 
**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**: SCP #### is contained within a Foundation-certified viral containment vault measuring 1.5 cubic meters. Any personnel seeking to interact with the object is to be outfitted in a hazardous materials suit as well as arm-length Kevlar animal-handling gloves rated to resist 2

**Description:** SCP #### appears as a normal dental phantom used for practice by students of dentistry. While it appears to be inanimate

The inherent danger of SCP #### stems from the unique viral agent found on the object’s teeth

**Case Log ####:**

Date: [|||]/[|||]/[||||]
Personnel: Dr. [|||||||||], and Dr. [|||||||||||] 

This trial used a total of [|||||||] healthy D-Class and personnel to gain information about the properties of SCP ####-2. 

**Group A:** Population: [|||||||] Procedure: Exposed to a bite from SCP #### and quarantined. 

**Group B:** Population: [|||||||] Procedure: Exposed to a bite from SCP #### and quarantined. Researchers delivered a daily 1ml dose of [|||||||] to suppress subjects’ immune systems. 

**Group C:** Population: [|||||||] Procedure: Given an injection of saline and quarantined with the other patients.

**24 Hours after exposure:**

A /B: Report discomfort in their mouths; teeth have begun to turn gray in color.

C: Nothing to report

**40 Hours after exposure:**

A/B: Teeth visibly rotting

C: Patients practice more regular dental hygiene; Report hearing a drilling noise. Blood test negative for SCP ####-2

Note: Review of audio surveillance returns no “drilling” noise. Researchers labeled the appearance of the sound in C as psychosomatic.

**60 Hours after exposure:**

A/B:  Patients’ teeth have either fallen out or rooted away. Report or intense cranial pressure. Oral examinations and X-Rays show the formation of highly dense bone material in the upper and lower jaw. 

C: Patient’s teeth decaying at a higher than average rate. Blood test negative for SCP ####-2

**80 Hours after exposure:**

A: All patients have developed impressive new sets of teeth. Individual teeth prove hard to extract

B: As Group A. Patients describe unpleasant pressure across their entire body and severe headaches.

C: Minor tooth decay. Blood test negative for SCP ####-2

**85 Hours after exposure:** 

A: Healthy besides tooth development.

B: [|||||||||||] total loss in population. Autopsies reveal cause of death in 90% of patients due to internal hemoraging caused by tooth-like growths developing across bones. The remaining 10% were caused by fatal pressure to the brain caused by the same tooth-like growths occurring on the inside of the skull. 

C: No report. Blood test negative for SCP####-2

**87 Hours after exposure:**

A: Relocated to Site [||||||] for further testing and surveillance. 

B: Entire population deceased. Primary cause of death: Internal and external hemorrhage caused by tooth-like growths rupturing muscle and skin. 

C: Blood test negative for SCP ####-2. Population administered class b amnesiacs and assigned to other projects. 

**Conclusion:**

 SCP ####-2 proves a serious threat to those with weak immune systems. Further testing on group A reveals that the virus has not left the blood stream and remains in dense packets within the mouth. Effect of bites from group A have been shown to be identical to those from SCP ####. The researchers on this project recommend cessation of all future testing on this object.

SCP #### was discovered in [||||||||||]

This would make a perfect game similar to that of Containment Breach. The setting would comprise of post war Nagasaki

You're given the ""assignment"" and as you travel through the rubble and (Very spooky) deserted buildings, breaking doors windows etc) that are necessary for progressing in the game will increase the spooky atmospherics and likelyhood of scp-1145 appearing.Upon seeing scp-1145, the player has limited time to escape before it becomes ""active"" and proceedes to hunt you (emmiting gamma radiation and destroying things it passes through).

This game is versatile as it also presents the opportunity to feature the following SCP items (in a similar fashion to Containment breach):

http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-990
http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-044

I'm sure there's plenty more! Ideas?

Hope you enjoyed reading and yeah... someone make this.
