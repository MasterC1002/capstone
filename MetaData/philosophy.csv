***YOU SHOULD NOT DOWNVOTE BECAUSE YOU DISAGREE

I'm very close to unsubscribing from this sub. I'm sick of the idiots who can't handle having their beliefs questioned with well reasoned arguments.

An important part of being a philosopher is recognizing the human condition for what it is and to ***actively fight against those tendencies***. In short, and ""try out"" believing other positions to get a much better grasp on what another position entails.

I would say we should remove downvotes altogether but I know that probably won't happen in this sub

So, when you downvote or attack a person because they take a different position, ""Why exactly am I downvoting/attacking? Is it because my beliefs are being questioned and I don't like that? Or is it because this person legitimately deserves to be silenced...?""

I'm sure most of you will dislike what I'm saying and downvote me. That's fine,False,,t5_2qh5b,False,,,t3_1cz33v

*edit:* I just got home from work, the discussion un this thread today has made me feel much better. Thanks for listening to get angry at you. 

It is to philosophy what /r/politics is to politics: non-conducive towards questioning and learning nor towards view point sharing. The community (whether at large or a dedicated minority) is biased heavily against those would come here to think, instead of encouragement and direction. Comments and posts are deemed all to easily ignorant and unintelligent, and down voted, responses and correction (fact wise or attempted conversions between school of thought included) are regularly condescending and malicious. This is not a place that celebrates philosophy or encourages growth (of logic skills, etc). Had any of us not had the free will of mind to ponder the world and come *freely* to the conclusions we have come to, or had any of us not received encouragement and direction towards free thinking and deduction then we would not, better or worse, curiosity, down voted, or formatting

For instance, on these intelligence tests, could not possibly have scored more than 80, by my estimate. I always took it for granted that I was far more intelligent than he was. Yet, when anything went wrong with my car I hastened to him with it, watched him anxiously as he explored its vitals, and listened to his pronouncements as though they were divine oracles - and he always fixed my car.

http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1doab8/to_a_daoist_the_trolley_problem_is_not_a_problem/

The article is total misinterpretation of Daoism

Firstly, seeming as Daoist writers wrote an entire book about how to care for society.    

Secondly *wu wei* does not literally mean 'non-action', or overly high taxes. These were seen as unnatural because they overtly interfered in the daily lives of the common people, making their lives more difficult and more complicated. Political Daoism is concerned with making the common people more spontaneous (*ziran*) so they can better follow the *dao* (way). Following the *dao* would supposedly bring a level of happiness and prosperity to society (again, showing direct, worldly concern for human beings). 

Thirdly, unavoidable part of life. However, just because he is ok with death doesn't mean he would allow his wife to die on a train track. Obviously he would save his wife that he loved, and this would be quite a 'natural' (*wu wei* compatible) action.

So, it is true that Daoists were aware that 'you never know what will happen' (i.e. one of that group might be the next Hitler). But, the fact remains that even if we disagree over this final point, the idea that the Daoist wouldn't care because he believes in 'non-action' is just ridiculous. ",,False,,1367808006.0,t3_1drju3

Let's see if we can explain something about the character of Good Guy Greg and his relevance or meaning on reddit and in our societies. 

I will just write some hypotheses to seed your discussion!

* Greg's seemingly mundane, caring, and humility make him a more relatable moral example than other heroes.
* Greg is emphatically not a prophet: he practices with no interest in preaching.
* Greg is not only ""good"" in what Nietzsche might call a ""moral"" sense; his goodness is also an aptitude
* With Good Guy Greg in mind, and renaissance humanism appear somewhat stodgy, clumsy, and in some ways seriously misguided.
* The internet popularity of the Good Guy Greg meme is of sociological importance.
* The concept ""good guy"" is a good example of the Aristotelian concept of virtue: to be a ""guy"" is to have a certain role or task
* Goodguyness is a conception of morality that is not narrowly subjective or objective — neither arbitrary and personally chosen nor ahistorical and platonically given

*ahem*


When life begins
 
When life ends

All things

Are soft and pliable in life

So the soft and supple are the companions of life

Whilst the stiff and unyielding are the companions of death.

An army that cannot yield will be defeated.

A tree that cannot bend will crack in the wind.

Thus

The hard and strong are defeated

Whilst the soft and gentle are triumphant.


**EDIT:** So, its just IMHO. I first read this text in a really bad time in my life, and it kind of embedded itself into the fashion of reflecting upon society and the human condition (I'm sure 2 years of psychology had nothing to do with that...).

Yet, even if we were to make our (addictive, totally shallow) game completely free, I'd still feel bad about people sinking time into it.

2. What if the machine were mildly addictive (enough to make people put in more time than they'd normally want

3. Maybe part of what bothers me about this machine is that it is not providing pleasure in a constructive way. A lot of the time, unsafe sex or sugary food or a dangerous drug), we consider that a bad quality.

- The only understanding I have of Nietzsche, and thus this is where the misconception may have been born from. 

- Nietzsche made the concept of the superman. The idea that man is a bridge between ape and the superman. The superman is the person who lives for himself/herself and goes beyond good and evil and all forms of traditional morality. The superman makes up his own morality and his own meaning in his life.

- I don't quite understand this part at all

- He had a big dislike of the philosophy of Plato and Western Philosophy. Why? I never quite understood this

- He made the quote ""God is Dead, I acknowledged long before I even knew who Nietzsche was, that God was a concept made up by human beings. EDIT: I forgot to mention that this quote also (or perhaps only) refers to the fact that religion was dying in Western society. Science and the industrial revolution was becoming more important in society, and Nietzsche believed it would ultimately kill religion and it's values. The problem with science in Nietzsche's view was that it did not give any values to people, thus when science kills religion, it would leave people valueless and thus nihilistic.

- Human beings main goal is the will to power. Humans want power because that's what Nietzsche believed we were naturally programmed to follow and that's how nature was.

- He wanted to go back to a morality of master morality rather than slave morality.

Overall to be honest I really don't understand why Nietzsche is so significant. So basically in a nutshell Nietzsche wanted us to be free spirits


I feel like I'm being dense and not understanding Nietzsche at all, so there must be more to him than I am seeing. It's difficult for me to read Nietzsche because his writing style is so poetic and metaphorical, it's not like other philosophers where their line of thinking is clear and logical. I would be really disappointed if Nietzsche was popular mainly because of his writing style and not because of his ideas.

So can anyone else please explain to me Nietzsche more in depth rather than the typical cliche summaries I've read about him over and over again?",,t5_2qh5b,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/sacep/why_is_nietzsche_so_popular/

I have decided to offer a defense of Indian philosophy with examples and hopefully clear up some perceptions. I will only be talking about Indian and not Chinese or Japanese philosophy

The problem according to BK Matilal is that 

&gt; 'Indian philosophy' has unfortu­nately  come  to  denote  a  group  of  occult  religious  cults,mysticism, and imprecise thinking,   concerned almost exclusively with' spiritual liberation' . Books, pamphlets, and other materials dealing with this theme are quite consid­erable  in  number  and  unfortunately  too  easily  available. 

He then mentions:
&gt;
&gt;The  results  of  recent  research  have  revealed  beyond  doubt  that a 
&gt;considerable portion of Indian philosophy consists of a number of rigor­
&gt;ous  systems  which are  more  concerned with  logic  and  epistemology
&gt;with the analysis  and  classification of human knowledge
&gt;with transcendent  states  of  euphoria. Verifications and  rational  proce­
&gt;dures  are  as much  an  essential  part of Indian  philosophical  thinking   as 
&gt;they are in Western philosophical thinking.  Thus
&gt;Indian   philosophy  in   modern  philosophic   circles  is  obviously   self­
&gt;perpetuating
&gt;to  recognize  and  make  known  in  Western languages  the counterpart to 
&gt;their  own  discipline. 


Some examples I'd like to mention:

Regarding logic, types of and rules for debate. The Nyaya tradition was a realist school, and they flourished alongside the other schools of thought until the 13th century when a new version ""Navya Nyaya"" was created to answer certain objections.

The debates between Nyaya and others developed logic in India over the years

This school was particularly rigorous and they came up with concepts that resembled Frege's theory of logic.

According to K.K. Chakrobarty:


&gt;In the third part we have shown how the study of the so-called 'restrictive conditions for universals' in Navya-Nyaya logic anticipated some of the developments of modern set theory. [...] In this section the discussion will center around some of the 'restrictive conditions for universals (jatibadhaka) proposed by Udayana. [...] Another restrictive condition is anavastha or vicious infinite regress. According to this restrictive condition, then, by hypothesis, we have got a given totality of all universals that exist and all of them belong to this big universal. But this universal is itself a universal and hence (since it cannot be a member of itself, because in Udayana's view no universal can be a member of itself) this universal too along with other universals must belong to a bigger universal and so on ad infinitum. What Udayana says here has interesting analogues in modern set theory in which it is held that a set of all sets (i.e., a set to which every set belongs) does not exist.


It might be interesting to mention that this upgrade came about due to the criticisms of a skeptic known as Sriharsa

While on the topic of skeptics, and the skeptic Jayarasi Bhatta.

Nagarjuna lived in the first century AD and is famous for his ideas of sunyata or emptiness

His work was continued by other famous logicians such as Dharmakirti and Chandrakirti; as well as  Bhavaviveka

Jayarashi Bhatta lived presumably around 800 AD, by a method of reductio arguments that all philosophical activity trying to arrive at true knowledge is useless. 


There is also the famous Advaita Vedanta school

Apart from them there are also other schools such as

Sankhya (metaphysical dualist)

Yoga (a type of dualist)

Vaisheshika (Atomist school)

Mimansa (realist exegetical school)

Other Buddhist schools like Pudgalavada and Adhidharma

There are also the Jains

1372219445.0,1h34uy,In response to a recent downvote brigade: convince me why I should take religious beliefs seriously in the 21st Century.,bombula,501,230,811,"To be clear

Are there any good reasons for accepting religious beliefs or claims as legitimate (read: *true*)?  To my knowledge

One definition of faith is belief in the absence of evidence.  Faith is sometimes regarded as a virtue.  It is even regarded as a source of morality.

I realize that this is not /r/atheism.  *Philosophically*, and infantile wishful thinking?

**EDIT: RESULTS**

Lots and LOTS of comments.  Here is a summary of the arguments that posters have offered:

-1. **[Argument from authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority).** Theism has been around a long time

-2. **[Argument from popularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum).** Billions of people have religious beliefs

-3. **Don't be a meanie.**  Religion deserves special treatment because it is important to people.  No.  No other category of ideas gets a free pass from harsh criticism - not political ideas, not even personal preferences in art, music, or literature.  Religious beliefs have no special claim to automatic respect.

-4. **Empiricism is overrated

Nonsense.  Empiricism makes technology possible

Moreover, to how other people will respond to our behavior, and a billion other examples - are all empirical.  They are the cumulative result of our comparing predictions our models make with the external world.  As adults, these models rarely fail.  That's what makes magicians awesome: they have tricks for breaking our personal empirical models of reality.  Science just extends empiricism beyond the reach of everyday human experience.  If walking on the moon were an everyday experience, our ancestors would never have thought it was made of spirits or cheese or whatever else.

OK

-5. **Empirically-supported claims are no more legitimate that faith-based claims

It is true that empirical knowledge is based on the assumption that consistency is useful.  However

DivineSleeper explains: ""To refute consistency itself

-6. **Religious beliefs are useful.**

I specifically asked for *intellectual*

Religious claims have *practical utility* with respect to an individual's psychology: they sometimes have a pro-social effect on how we feel

Empiricism has *epistemic utility*: it allows us to build a framework of claims that is both self-consistent and consistent with the external universe it attempts to describe.  Religious claims appear to have little or no epistemic utility.

-7. **KGDavid says ""If theism is not true, epistemology, and ontology.""**

I find that the [standard objections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument#Criticisms_and_objections) dispense with these [quite easily](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ontological-arguments/#ObjOntArg).  

The objection that resonates most with me is that causation is meaningless without time, and a Creator are similarly meaningless concepts.  This does a good job of obviating the First Cause infinite regress paradox.

* ask for someone to clarify what they mean by a particular word;
* suggest that someone is using a word nonstandardly;
* distinguish between two different senses of a word; or
* say anything that has anything to do with language.

But most often

When ""semantics"" is used as loosely as it tends to here,"" or that the proof that there are an infinitely many primes is ""just a reductio ad absurdum."" But so what? There's nothing wrong with those forms of argument; the fact that I can give them a label hardly changes that. So the same goes for ""arguing semantics."" If you think someone is arguing semantics, you ought not to stop there. Instead, ask what *difference* it makes that that their argument hinges on a distinction, or a particular usage of a word, or what have you. If you find that the real problem is that someone is drawing an *irrelevant* distinction, why not just say that? Far more clear than just accusing them of ""arguing semantics.""

""Semantics"" is the study of meaning. Not questions about the meanings of particular words (""Does doing right mean maximizing happiness?"") but about how words and other signs relate to their meanings in general.

There is an old anecdote about an experiment involving monkeys. I don't know if this ever an actual experiment or just a story meant to enlighten. Regardless, when one of the monkeys went for the treat, the other four would beat him up or restrain him before he could get to it; they didn't like being sprayed with the hose. 

Then, the new monkey naturally went to grab it. However, the 4 old monkeys would beat up the new monkey to stop him from grabbing the treat and save themselves from being hosed down. This rotation and process continued.

Eventually, in doing so, prevented the water bath. Yet despite not knowing *why* they prevented each other from claiming the treat, they still did so simply because they created a self-reinforcing system where monkeys get beat up for trying to grab the treat. The monkeys had been trained to train other monkeys, without even realizing it, and without knowing why.

Back to the Matrix.

When Neo, et al are adventuring inside the system, one of the biggest threats is other people, the blue-pillers. There are numerous chase scenes where Agents 'take over' blue-pillers in pursuit of red-pillers. In the third film, Agent Smith actually takes over *everyone* in the Matrix in the final battle with Neo.

The idea was that technology uses humans to continuously invent newer and more complex technology until the technology can reproduce itself and the human becomes obsolete. The human body is in that view nothing more than a way of controlling the environment in order to (from the point of the human) survive

I think that this is very similar to Daniel Quinn's idea that our entire modern agricultural society is nothing more than a doomed way of trying to control our environment. However Quinn argues that we will not succeed in control because it is a vain attempt due to the fact that any control will lead to the need for more control as well as the destruction of the environment which we are trying to control.

So there are basically two scenarios: either the singularity happens and technology manages to reproduce itself or we will fail before that because we self-destroy.

1368581103.0,1ecrsu,What Can Atheists Get out of Reading Kierkegaard?,ConclusivePostscript,297,57,88,"Kierkegaard is first and foremost a Christian author. He identifies the issue of his “whole authorship” as “*becoming a Christian*” (*The Point of View*, the idea of religiousness in reflection” (*Journals and Papers*, to create secular

But if this is so, possibly get out of reading Kierkegaard? To this frequently asked question, I offer the following as a starting-point:

1. Kierkegaard is well-known as the “father of existentialism”; he has had significant influence not only on theistic existentialists (e.g., Shestov, Berdyaev) and quasi-theistic existentialists (Jaspers), but also their atheistic counterparts (Kafka, Camus, Sartre, Heidegger). Kierkegaard has often been compared to that other notorious arch-existentialist, e.g.

2. Kierkegaard has been influential in psychology. See, J. Preston Cole’s *The Problematic Self in Kierkegaard and Freud*, and existential psychotherapist Rollo May’s *The Meaning of Anxiety* and *The Discovery of Being*, ch. 5.

3. Postmodern theorists have been interested in Kierkegaard for his critique of rationalism, and liberate it (for better or worse) from its religious *telos*.

4. Kierkegaard’s review of Hans Christian Andersen’s *Only a Fiddler*,” which is “more than experience” but, rather, “the transubstantiation of experience,” an “unshakable certainty in oneself won from all experience, whether this has oriented itself only in all worldly relationships (a purely human standpoint, Stoicism,” or “in its heavenward direction (the religious)” has “won the true Christian conviction” (*Early Polemical Writings*, “is not a rush candle that goes out in a puff of air but a conflagration that the storm only incites” (ibid.,” who depends on the reading public for validation

5. Kierkegaard’s dissertation, irony in its “world-historical validity,” and irony in its ‘surgical’ function “in enabling personal life to gain health and truth” (p. 328).

6. Kierkegaard’s *Either/Or*, contains a number of witty aphorisms comparable to Nietzsche’s aphoristic style (in “Diapsalmata”), an imaginary aesthete’s Mozart-eulogizing treatment of music’s immediacy (in “The Immediate Erotic Stages, or The Musical-Erotic”), a theory of seduction (in “The Seducer’s Diary”), and much else besides.

7. Though atheists will find Kierkegaard’s *The Concept of Anxiety* and *The Sickness Unto Death* fraught with theological undertones, #1, above, and the works of Rollo May in #2, respectively).

8. Philosophers of emotions have found in Kierkegaard a “classical moral psychologist.” See, emotion, and virtue: Classical themes in Kierkegaard” (*The Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard*, ch. 7), David Kangas’ “Kierkegaard” (*The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Emotion*, ch. 21), R. A. Furtak’s *Wisdom in Love: Kierkegaard and the Ancient Quest for Emotional Integrity* (esp. ch. 5)

9. Kierkegaard’s *Prefaces* constitutes satire on the “visible reading public” and its relation to an author

10. Kierkegaard’s pseudonym Johannes Climacus is primarily concerned with what it means to exist “Christianly-religiously, p. 249). Consequently, much of *Postscript* is relevant to those who have little or no interest in Christianity or religion.

11. Throughout Kierkegaard’s authorship, including the concept of “leveling.” For application of Kierkegaard’s thought to the Internet age, see the references I’ve listed in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/kierkegaard/comments/169s2y/the_present_age_and_reddit/c803ii2).

12. Kierkegaard’s *Works of Love*, say, Westboro Baptist Church). See also atheist philosopher Simon Critchley’s sympathetic analysis in his article “[The Rigor of Love](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/the-rigor-of-love/).”

13. Kierkegaard’s letters offer us a more intimate look at one man’s love of the written word. One of Kierkegaard’s principles of letter-writing is to keep the recipient free from any obligation to respond: “My letters, Letter #61). Kierkegaard also treats letter-writing as akin to taking a walk with a friend or relative. Accordingly, here we find Kierkegaard at his most personal and, on occasion, his most avuncular.

14. Kierkegaard’s “Attack on Christendom” (see *The Moment and Late Writings*) presents atheists with a lively example of a religion’s rigorous self-critique. This should be the spirit of any worldview, Bishop Mynster, atheists should not be afraid to criticize popular atheist writers (including the self-styled “four horsemen” of the New Atheism).

15. Within the aforementioned “Attack, a Christian country, a Christian world” as “an enormous illusion” (ibid., p. 157). On this theme, see Stephen Backhouse’s recent book, *Kierkegaard’s Critique of Christian Nationalism*, which begins and ends with Kierkegaard’s remark, a Christian people

Perhaps needless to say, *Kierkegaard Research: Sources, Reception and Resources* (editor-in-chief, Jon Stewart), one can trace further Kierkegaardian influences on existentialism, theology, philosophy, poetry, and socio-political thought.

Let me also suggest that atheists need not attempt to extricate Kierkegaard’s philosophical import from his theological concerns. Even for those whose concerns are strictly secular, Nietzsche, and Camus without attempting to “Christianize” them.

I conclude with an excerpt from atheist Julian Baggini’s [recent article](http://www.aeonmagazine.com/world-views/julian-baggini-i-love-kierkegaard/) on the Dane: “Kierkegaard was the master of irony and paradox before both became debased by careless overuse. He was an existentialist a century before Jean-Paul Sart[r]e, whose work is pertinent for all ages yet destined to be fully attuned to none.”",,False,,t5_2qh5b,False,,

I recently watched the film this weekend with my brother

Each of the characters represent a different philosophical concept. As the story progresses

Characters with corresponding philosophical idea

1. Albert (Jason Swartzman) - The **self**. The subject that is going through an existential crisis. Ultimately, and finally to self-actualization(or authenticity). 

2. Catherine (Isabelle Huppert) - **Nihilism**. She is the ultimate enemy in the film. As an existential self

3. Bernard (Dustin Hoffman) and Vivian (Lily Tomlin) - While both represent two very different ideas, the big idea and tries to understand the details of his life in the context of the blanket. He understands the 'parts' *through* the 'whole'. Vivian takes the reductionist metaphysical perspective. She is the 'a posteriori knowledge'. She represents science and **epistemology**. Notice she only observes the experience itself and takes notes. She tries to understand the blanket by building up the details themselves. She understands the whole through adding the parts. While Bernard and Vivian may appear to fight and be disjointed at times, they are actually happily married. Neither one is more powerful than the other and neither one tells the other one that they are wrong. 

4. Brad (Jude Law) - He represents corporate America and **superficial everyday life** in general.  Brad does not understand the deep questions of life, but sees philosophy as a means to end and not an end in itself. This is why his pursuit of philosophy ends in failure. He ends up having a miserable life.

5. Tommy (Mark Wahlberg) - He represents the man who only accepts half of philosophy, explained below), he and Albert (self) can achieve self-actualization. Tommy is also constantly referred to as Albert's other in the film. ['Other'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other#The_idea_of_the_Other) is a continental philosophical concept that the 'self' (Albert) uses to define itself. Without Tommy (the 'other'), Albert has nothing to base his 'self' on, which he needs to know to self-actualize and become authentic.

6. Dawn (Naomi Watts) - She is the foil character to Tommy (reductionism). She only accepts the opposite half of philosophy from Tommy, just like Brad. However, when she discovers philosophy, she retreats from the world and becomes incapable of living in it properly. This isn't the appropriate response to philosophy either, but she is still a crucial component to understanding philosophy. Even though she looks crazy to the real world, she just has a completely different understanding of the world that the everyday superficial world (Brad) needs to recognize, but inevitably fails. When she gets with her foil character, the 'self' (Albert) becomes authentic. 

7. The African - He represents **coincidence** and how the self (Albert) tries to use coincidences/accidents to define their existence. He ultimately is not meaningful, the director certainly portrayed them as being hypocritical when they are faced with Tommy (science, reductionism).

""Thankyou for coming out tonight.  Let's get straight into tonight's discussion - are you for or against gay marriage?""

The man takes some time before eventually replying ""I'd have to say I am for gay marriage.""  The audience cheers in approval.  The man stares cynically into the audience

""I'd like to ask everyone in the audience to raise their hands if they support gay marriage.""

A sea of hands rise in the audience

""Please keep your hand raised if the reason you support gay marriage is that two individuals should be allowed the right to marry

No hands were lowered, proceeded to ask a third question. 

""Please keep your hand raised if you support incestuous relations and believe that two partners of the same family should be allowed the right to marry.""

The crowd appeared disgusted by the question and lowered their hands almost simultaneously. Not a single hand remained raised in the crowd.  The main slowly walked toward the audience until he stopped at the first row of seats.  He placed a microphone in a young woman's hand. 

""Would you please tell the audience why you oppose incest

The woman frowned

""It's simply disgusting! More importantly

The audience began to applaud in approval

""You raise a good point.  Let me then remove the variable which is justifing your opinion and refine my question.  Could the audience please raise their hand if they support incestuous relations and marriage between two brothers, of course, that the couple is genuinely in love.""

No one in the audience rose their hand.  The man turned back to the woman.  He then asked the woman again why she did not support incestuous marriage

""Because it's just wrong!  You can't compare the love held between a gay couple to that of an incest couple!"" 

The man looked down at the woman. 

""Why not?"" 

The woman began to cry.  As if on cue, the man returned to stage.  He tapped his microphone gently before speaking. 

""I'll tell you why it's wrong.  It's wrong because society wants us to think it's wrong.  We live in a time and a country where it's okay to support gay marriage and not be judged by your decision.  In fact, just as fifty years ago no one would have shown their support for gay marriage.  You justify your disapproval by saying that incestuous marriage will stagnate the gene pool.  However, when the question is modified to no longer include this means of justification you still think it's wrong and you have no idea why.  The reason why, ladies and gentlemen, is that our opinions aren't dictated by our own morality.  Our opinions are dictated by the conventional norms of society.  The masses don't want you to support incestuous marriage - and you don't.  You can think of no other reason why other than it being 'wrong' and 'gross', but none the less you still don't support it.""

Now, many women plan on getting an abortion if they should end up pregnant, etc. According to this pro-life claim, it seems, we are supposed to interpret the act of consensual sex itself as involving some sort of mysterious *tacit consent* and *occult commitments* that are not only morally significant, but so overwhelmingly morally important as to *completely override the actual preferences of the woman*. I don't think actions carry occult commitments, and this all seems like superstition to me.

But here's my question. Let's suppose for the sake of argument that actions *do* carry occult commitments. Even granting this, a typical pro-lifer might say that the act of consensual sex carries the commitment to bear the child, waiving one's right to an abortion. But a more radical pro-lifer might say that the act of consensual sex carries the commitment to bear *and raise* the child, waiving one's right to an abortion as well as one's right to put the child up for adoption. My question is: how are we supposed to tell which interpretation is correct, and which occult commitments are (and are not) carried by the act of consensual sex?

""It would have been very comforting indeed to believe that Eichmann was a monster . . . The trouble with Eichmann was precisely that so many were like him, and still are terribly and terrifyingly normal.""

Hannah Arendt

Unless you've been living under a rock (cue Geico) you've probably heard the infectious single by Foster the People called ""Pumped Up Kicks"" on the radio this past year.

What you may or may not have noticed, psychotic teen fantasizing about (or even considering) shooting and killing his classmates at school.

I've been wanting to tackle this song for a while now - but it was only after watching Terrence Malick's first film Badlands last week that something clicked. 

Here's why.

In an interview he gave last summer

""The song is about a teenage kid that is trapped, and shooting people, and these things are happening younger and younger, 14 or 13 years old. It's turning into an epidemic for American youth. I wanted to infiltrate, and dig beneath the surface and get into the psychology of what's going on in a kid's mind like that.""

On the band's Wikipedia

""The issue of youth violence is a matter close to the group. Foster was bullied in high school, 'The song is not about condoning violence at all. It's the complete opposite.'""

Foster makes some important points - while the tragedies of Columbine and Virginia Tech probably stand out as two of the most tragic, and lost youth who feel like violence is their only option.

Admittedly, especially in music. Pre-Columbine, Pearl Jam was tapping into the psychology of just such a young person with the song and video ""Jeremy""; post-Columbine, goth-rock group Korn's single ""Thoughtless"" is about ""a bullied teenager who dreams of killing his tormentors,"" and POD's ""Youth of the Nation"" describes a school shooting in the first verse.

But all of these songs predictably reflect their subject matter - the music itself is dark, angry youth's thoughts to ""sound' like, and allows us to distance ourselves from them, even though we remain empathetic.
What makes ""Pumped Up Kicks"" unique is the juxtaposition of the dark, expecting lyrics about summer love or beach parties - when suddenly, those strange phrases whiz by us like bullets: ""you better run, better run, outrun my gun.""

The lyrics are particularly horrifying because of their context - the song is not insanely angry nor insanely happy. There's not anything there to signify the insane or even dangerous - its exterior is casual

Foster the People's snappy groove flouts our tidy expectations, Columbine revenge.""

This was also my experience of the song - and after watching Badlands for the first time

First, to start killing. Kit lures his young girlfriend Holly into his senseless crime spree, which plays out against a very Midwestern background that reflects Kit's attitude (one reviewer called the scenery ""breathtaking both in its sweep and in its banality"").
The characters of Kit and Holly are alienated from the world, both Kit and Holly, had an image of themselves that was way out of the realm of reality.""

But even though they're deluded and dangerous, and even bored with themselves and their actions - and the effect is terrifying.

As one reviewer wrote: ""Sheen conveys Kit's craziness so effectively because he does not ever act the madman."" They shrug, as Holly puts it, ""kind of blah, like a bathtub after the water has all gone down the drain."" They are - like the singer in ""Pumped Up Kicks"" - all too casual.

Badlands, the film makes us cozy up to the unexceptional, even charming exterior that harbors evil, in order to really see it and understand its ""banality.""

The ""banality of evil"" is a phrase coined by Hannah Arendt during the trail of Nazi Adolf Eichmann, what has to get done to advance themselves or even just to ""get from point A to point B.""

Although evil is banal

""It was sheer thoughtlessness—something by no means identical with stupidity—that predisposed him to become one of the greatest criminals of that period...such remoteness from reality and such thoughtlessness can wreak more havoc than all the evil instincts taken together...""

This notion reflects a Thomistic idea of evil, or ""lack of good."" Good can exist without evil - but evil can't exist without good. Evil is a parasite of the good, with no real essence.

Of course

But maybe it means that we are forced to confront their humanity, and evil itself. This is not a comfortable process - it's also a hard thing to convey properly in art without coming across as ""glorifying"" or ""making light of"" evil.

I understand most people will probably have some reservations about getting excited about a song that

It is simply a comparison of one theme (in this case, the name of baby animals of a species versus fully developed ones.)  What other factors they may differ are on that are not related to this one central theme are irrelevant.

2.  Similarly, the presenter of this analogy should not be faulted or criticized for invoking the Nazis.  He is not comparing the loggers to the Nazis - he is merely presenting a counter-example to the idea that ""Needing a job justifies otherwise immoral action.""  He is in no way saying the logger is like a camp guard, but is instead testing this one idea in the most extreme circumstance possible.  Given the revulsion most would feel at saying that being a camp guard is morally justified by the need for a job, the defender of loggers should either a) retract the original statement in its entirety, b) amend it (such as adding ""except in the case of directly harming other humans""), or c) contest that the comparison does not hold in some critical manner.  But, to wave it off for its invocation of the Nazis is fallacious at best.

3.  This is not a defense of ""The Nazis wore pants"" type arguments.  For example, it is making sweeping statements about the person's mindset and the motives for their idea.

If this is true, then I think we can say the NSA's actions are wrong according to Mill because an atmosphere of surveillance stifles your ability to act creatively. Furthermore, I think we can also say the NSA's actions are wrong according to Kant because the NSA is interfering with your capacity to use your property independently of anyone else and thereby limits your freedom.

If you've made it to my post

Philosophy developed as a love of wisdom and that usually meant wisdom in two distinct areas: the public, and the private, inner world.  Since the enlightenment and the scientific revolution, it became increasingly difficult to say anything meaningful at all about the natural world without some sort of natural science background.  I think that's a fair claim.  Philosophical questions simply became either eliminated from the conversation altogether, because they were no longer relevant (""would God put the sun or the earth at the center of the universe?""), or they became scientific questions (""what is the nature of matter?"")

It turns out that now, to some extent, an objective, third person view of first person phenomena that were for millenia off limits to scientific inquiry.  This is a new development and means some important things for philosophy.  Again, much like the natural world, questions become either eliminated from the conversation altogether because they are no longer relevant (""what is the nature of the soul?"") or become scientific questions (""what is the nature of pain or pleasure?"")  Now, what does this mean for philosophy?

My answer is not that philosophy is dying, science), in order to discover the best approach for learning what we do *not* know and are limited in our ability to understand given our current technological limitations.  

For this reason, for example, you shouldn't first be turning to Taoist texts, but to Newton and Einstein.  If you want to study the philosophy of the mind or consciousness, you should at least be remotely competent in basic neuroscience and biology before you attempt to press onward.

When I saw this

But it also made me consider whether recounting a story about an anonymous act of kindess diminishes (retroactively, beyond appreciating 'having done a good thing' within oneself. Does recounting it – and perhaps receiving social accolade – reduce the degree of selflessness, and therefore the virtue of the act? Or, am I simply confusing myself, assuming that selflessness  imparts a higher degree of virtue to an act? (E.g. If ones saves a baby for selfless reasons or selfish ones, the baby is still saved, right? So why does it matter?)

Furthermore

The only philosophical/theological tradition I know of in this vein (NB: I'm not well versed in philosophy) is Calvinism, an act from which there is a reward extracted is not virtuous.

Response from Butler:

Well, but a thoughtful essayist who has something very important to say. You don't need me to tell you that.  The part of my work you draw on does suggest that gender works on us more than we work on it. But others have accused me of being too volitional, claiming that one can, in fact, subvert norms by performing gender differently.  The truth is, I think, that for me, but we also act within them.  Some of you folks can really take on a gender one day, as you know.  Derrida is the one who formulates performativity in Signature, and even the Law of Genre.  So he is not against the performative

2. Appeal to the quantum.  Quantum physics is weird. It's inexplicably weird.  That doesn't mean it's an excuse for your batshit theory on consciousness or what have you.  I think people have become more aware of how futile it is to try to develop a positive explanation of some phenomena through the use of quantum lingo.  There will still be the occasional pseudo-intellectual or spiritual huckster like Deepak Chopra that will try and invoke the vocabulary of quantum physics for their own irrational ends

3. The impossibility of negative proof.  You can prove a negative.  The relevant point in the God debate is more along the lines of Russell's teapot, but I think Godel's incompleteness theorem can be seen as a negative proof against Logicism.

You are expected to spit copy at an alarming rate, with little or no regard for self-editing (after all there are other people paid to do it). I was sadly unprepared for my first wave of j-school deadlines, since I would spend hours agonizing over relatively minor details in my articles, as I was used to in philosophy.

Free Will: The ability to make choices unconstrained by certain factors. 


The factors are the key feature in the definition of free will. 

Can we choose a course of action which is impossible to achieve through physical constraints? I would not be hesitant to say yes

I would argue that social constraints can similarly be breached if and only if it's within their mental &amp; metaphysical constraints. That is to say the some people can and do chose things that society condemns and prohibits. 

What remains are metaphysical and mental constraints. My argument is that even if metaphysical or mental constraints limited a view of free will that is was useful as a construct for progress.


What do I mean when I say that free will is useful as a construct for progress? I mean that the notion of free will engenders actions of an agent with direct responsibility and this direct responsibility being an entry condition for mental constraints would cause an individual to act significantly different for the majority of cases. So to enable society to function and develop individual responsibility of actions and the free will to make the choices and bear the consequences that the choices hold should be a maintained shared illusion.

This leads me to conclude that the ultimate realization of gaming, I nevertheless feel that a) in crafting unique locales with their own rules and objectives, and b) in attempting to draw in the player with fun, accessible game design, games are as much open doors to new worlds as they are closed doors to our own. 

It might also be worth reflecting on the *teleology* of games. It shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that moral skepticism and relativism are as common as coffee in the modern West, tend to have a fixed, simple objective which, when realized, bestows great satisfaction upon the player. And because games can be played and re-played, no goal is ever lost: any player can pop in another figurative quarter and try again. The fixed teleological quality of games is yet another incentive to escape from our morally ambiguous world and into the simplicity of virtual hubs. 

Which leads me to my last question: are games *good* for society? (I'm something of a gamer myself, unimaginative real world. There's a reason gamers tend to be reclusive.

If there’s one thing Friedrich Nietzsche did well, a cynic and a pessimist, but I think these assessments are off the mark. I believe he only wanted human beings to be more honest with themselves.

He did have a remarkable gift for aphorism — he once declared

Even today his words remain controversial. They hit nerves. Most of his views are completely at odds with the status quo.

Here are 40 unsympathetic statements from the man himself. Many you’ll agree with. Others you will resist, ask yourself why.

***

1. People who have given us their complete confidence believe that they have a right to ours. The inference is false

2. He that humbleth himself wishes to be exalted.

3. The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently.

4. There are no facts

5. Morality is but the herd-instinct in the individual.

6. No one talks more passionately about his rights than he who in the depths of his soul doubts whether he has any.

7. Without music

8. Anyone who has declared someone else to be an idiot

9. In large states public education will always be mediocre

10. The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends.

11. A casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything.

12. We often refuse to accept an idea merely because the way in which it has been expressed is unsympathetic to us.

13. No victor believes in chance.

14. Convictions are more dangerous foes of truth than lies.

15. Talking much about oneself can also be a means to conceal oneself.

16. It is not a lack of love

17. The essence of all beautiful art

18. The future influences the present just as much as the past.

19. The most common lie is that which one tells himself; lying to others is relatively an exception.

20. I counsel you

21. Rejoicing in our joy

22. God is a thought who makes crooked all that is straight.

23. Success has always been a great liar.

24. Nothing on earth consumes a man more quickly than the passion of resentment.

25. What do you regard as most humane? To spare someone shame.

26. Whatever is done for love always occurs beyond good and evil.

27. When a hundred men stand together

28. When one has a great deal to put into it a day has a hundred pockets.

29. Whoever despises himself nonetheless respects himself as one who despises.

30. All things are subject to interpretation. Whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth.

31. What is good? All that heightens the feeling of power, that resistance is overcome.

32. Fear is the mother of morality.

33. A politician divides mankind into two classes: tools and enemies.

34. Everyone who has ever built anywhere a new heaven first found the power thereto in his own hell.

35. There is more wisdom in your body than in your deepest philosophy.

36. The mother of excess is not joy but joylessness.

37. The Kingdom of Heaven is a condition of the heart — not something that comes upon the earth or after death.

38. What is the mark of liberation? No longer being ashamed in front of oneself.

39. Glance into the world just as though time were gone: and everything crooked will become straight to you.

We'd like to run a reading group for Kant's famous *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals*.

/r/philosophy users come from all sorts of philosophical backgrounds. Some of us are just picking up our first works of philosophy as we get here, whether old or new to philosophy, there's always something to take from Kant's *Groundwork*.

My interest is not to disentangle her confusion of Kierkegaard’s categories, Kierkegaard’s pseudonym Johannes Climacus presents us with a distinction between “Religiousness *A*” and “Religiousness *B*” and a rich, sustained analysis of each sphere. The first signifies a person’s recognition of their relation to an eternal happiness; the second signifies faith in the God-man, the “absolute paradox,” the Incarnate Christ. For Climacus, the first is presupposed to (but not to be confused with) the second.

Climacus describes Religiousness *A* in terms of “pathos, Hongs’ trans., p. 387). True religious pathos “lies not in testifying to an eternal happiness but in transforming one’s own existence into a testimony to it” (ibid., p. 394). “The highest well-being of a happy immediacy, which jubilates joy over God and all existence, is very endearing but not upbuilding and essentially not any relationship with God” (ibid., p. 560, in contrast to Religiousness *B*, Religiousness *A* locates the God-relationship in “the individual himself” (ibid.

In Jay Gatsby

&gt; The truth was that Jay Gatsby, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that—and he must be about His Father’s Business, the service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty. So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end. (*The Great Gatsby*

Gatsby’s beauty is “meretricious” not merely because he is originally the poor James Gatz, despite his self-made outward appearance, is not to be sought in earthly riches. Gatsby transcends the esthetic life-view of his contemporaries (most notably that of Tom and Daisy). Instead, his dream is bound up in his love for Daisy:

&gt; His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete. (ibid.)

Despite the language of “incarnation” and “son of God” in these passages, the resemblance is both unorthodox (he is a bootlegger and an adulterer) and unwitting (though he voluntarily takes the blame for Daisy’s manslaughter of Myrtle, he does not foresee the lethal consequences of his act).

More would need to be said to fully justify locating Gatsby in the realm of Religiousness *A*. For Climacus associates this form of religiousness with other important but complex categories: e.g., and the incognito of humor. Accordingly, my suggestion that Gatsby can be illuminated from the standpoint of Religiousness *A* is but a hypothesis that would require further testing against Fitzgerald’s complex protagonist. But, as a tentative judgment, it seems to me that Gatsby is higher than the esthetic sphere and lower than Religiousness *B*. Accordingly, he points up the limitations of the esthetic life-view of the Jazz Age without surrendering to the existential despair characteristic of his murderer, George Wilson, Nick Carraway. Gatsby shows us the poverty of one version of the American Dream, whether there could be or should be.

Or if a black man complains about racism after somebody crosses the street to avoid him

Or if a woman complains about casual sexism in a work environment

Am I right in thinking that this argument is a fallacy? If so

depression?",57,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/smjeq/could_this_be_partly_a_reason_for_existentialist/,"I’ve thought that maybe people nowadays are so depressed because we are in known of the time we are living in and ourselves. Back in the days for example history writing wasn’t as common as it is today. Today everything is being put into knowledge banks and every day we can read news about the smallest things that happen around the world. Everything is noted down and almost every citizen can know whatever they want. People are being put into registers and we know exactly (or at least we are excepted to know) who we are, what we do, where will we be in 10 years

As a contrast, we are supposed to be like this and that!”. They just lived. They didn’t know they were going to be put into history books. Their life didn’t have a purpose on paper but they lived just for living. Only we, modern humans, are conceptualizing people in different eras and even ourselves. We are in known about that our actions are being written in papers and there will be books about our era’s people. Sometimes it feels like we are living in the papers, not in the moment!

(*I'm not a history researcher so there of course might have been signs of such phenomenons in Medieval era too

Maybe all this knowledge is actually making people feel meaningless. Yes, yes I’ve done this and that in my past and my income is blablabla. Psychology, biology, sociology and other branches of science are researching every movement of human behavior neurologically, biologically, psychologically and from humanistic point of view. If one wanted, they could find reasons for every act of theirs (or at least think they’ve found the right reasons). Our world is so conceptualized that even such phenomenons as shyness or feeling crush for celebrities are being listed as disorders. 

It’s like we want to know and research so much that the words on papers become us more than what we really are in real, supports conceptualizing. We are supposed to be good at pointing out causalities, writing them down and being good writers otherwise, doing research, being able to make observations of our surroundings and put them down, memorize lots and lots of text for exams and so on. This all represents the admiring of written knowledge, written reality.

Any thoughts? And oh it's a bit ironic I'm writing critic about ""the written reality"" but I'm actually finding reasons for existential depression by listing them right here right now too.

A few months later, perhaps a little hyperbolically. “Nor do I go to cocktail parties, dinners or anything like that.” He lived outside conventional ideas, he implied, because “I live alone mostly, in the middle of nowhere.”

Around the same time, I’m reliably told, lies in “black-hole resorts,” which charge high prices precisely because you can’t get online in their rooms.

Has it really come to this?

In barely one generation we’ve moved from exulting in the time-saving devices that have so expanded our lives to trying to get away from them — often in order to make more time. The more ways we have to connect

Internet rescue camps in South Korea and China try to save kids addicted to the screen.

Writer friends of mine pay good money to get the Freedom software that enables them to disable (for up to eight hours) the very Internet connections that seemed so emancipating not long ago. Even Intel (of all companies) experimented in 2007 with conferring four uninterrupted hours of quiet time every Tuesday morning on 300 engineers and managers. (The average office worker today, but simply had the chance to clear their heads and to hear themselves think. A majority of Intel’s trial group recommended that the policy be extended to others.

THE average American spends at least eight and a half hours a day in front of a screen, often simultaneously, is also steadily increasing).

The average American teenager sends or receives 75 text messages a day, as any economist will tell you, is a function of scarcity, the children of tomorrow, I heard myself tell the marketers in Singapore, will crave nothing more than freedom, if only for a short while, streaming videos and scrolling headlines that leave them feeling empty and too full all at once.

The urgency of slowing down — to find the time and space to think — is nothing new, the less time and energy we have to place it in some larger context. “Distraction is the only thing that consoles us for our miseries,” the French philosopher Blaise Pascal wrote in the 17th century, “and yet it is itself the greatest of our miseries.” He also famously remarked that all of man’s problems come from his inability to sit quietly in a room alone.

When telegraphs and trains brought in the idea that convenience was more important than content — and speedier means could make up for unimproved ends — Henry David Thoreau reminded us that “the man whose horse trots a mile in a minute does not carry the most important messages.” Even half a century ago, warned, “When things come at you very fast, naturally you lose touch with yourself.” Thomas Merton struck a chord with millions, by not just noting that “Man was made for the highest activity, which is, in fact,” but by also acting on it

Yet few of those voices can be heard these days, are visited for 10 seconds or less). And the more that floods in on us (the Kardashians, Obamacare, “Dancing with the Stars”), the less of ourselves we have to give to every snippet. All we notice is that the distinctions that used to guide and steady us — between Sunday and Monday, public and private, here and there — are gone.

We have more and more ways to communicate

So what to do? The central paradox of the machines that have made our lives so much brighter

MAYBE that’s why more and more people I know, or meditation, or tai chi; these aren’t New Age fads so much as ways to connect with what could be called the wisdom of old age. Two journalist friends of mine observe an “Internet sabbath” every week, turning off their online connections from Friday night to Monday morning, so as to try to revive those ancient customs known as family meals and conversation. Finding myself at breakfast with a group of lawyers in Oxford four months ago, I noticed that all their talk was of sailing — or riding or bridge: anything that would allow them to get out of radio contact for a few hours.

Other friends try to go on long walks every Sunday, that after spending time in quiet rural settings, subjects “exhibit greater attentiveness, stronger memory and generally improved cognition. Their brains become both calmer and sharper.” More than that, empathy, as well as deep thought, depends (as neuroscientists like Antonio Damasio have found) on neural processes that are “inherently slow.” The very ones our high-speed lives have little time for.

In my own case, and every trip to the movies would be an event.

None of this is a matter of principle or asceticism; it’s just pure selfishness. Nothing makes me feel better — calmer, a conversation, a piece of music. It’s actually something deeper than mere happiness: it’s joy, which the monk David Steindl-Rast describes as “that kind of happiness that doesn’t depend on what happens.”

It’s vital, and to know what’s going on; I took pains this past year to make separate trips to Jerusalem and Hyderabad and Oman and St. Petersburg, to rural Arkansas and Thailand and the stricken nuclear plant in Fukushima and Dubai. But it’s only by having some distance from the world that you can see it whole, and understand what you should be doing with it.

In a discussion about abortion I found myself coming to the conclusion that infanticide is not necessarily immoral. The train of thought comes from asking at what point is it immoral to abort a fetus. I found every argument seemed either arbitrary, this occurs no earlier than .5-1 years after birth (depending on the development of the baby). Society happily applies this moral principle to meat consumption, but is ever so slightly hesitant ( /s ) to apply it to humans. But there is nothing morally different between the two (imo), as they have the exact same state of mind and the fact that one's organs are arranged differently than the other seems arbitrary. So to me, it is inconsistent to apply one standard (killing any organism that reacts in a somewhat sophisticated manner to stimuli) to non-human animals as to humans.

Of course, there isn't anything inconsistent about it and it is ultimately an arbitrary moral tenet type of choice.

Even for a near-emotionless, implementing this as political policy probably would probably have unintended effects when applied to a society that I haven't thought of, but for now I'm not very interested in that. Also, this obviously only applies when the parents are both willing to commit infanticide and are mentally sound, as killing other people's babies is immoral the same way destroying another person's TV (and personal property in general) is immoral.

One answer may be progressive taxation. Some key factors of what progressive taxation entails (taken from Wikipedia): A progressive tax is a tax in which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases. Progressive taxes attempt to reduce the tax incidence of people with a lower ability-to-pay, or selective taxation that creates progressive distribution effects.  

In general

My question: are taxation systems that do not attempt to do this unethical? Is it ethical to allow multi-millionaires to continue to amass wealth while there are large portions of the society below the poverty line?  

Let us assume that wealth has diminishing returns on a person's quality of living after a certain level of it is reached. Given that, to those below the poverty line, to who it would benefit immensely, the only ethical decision to make?

I'm currently 21, political, metaphysical, I ate it all up!  

As I'm getting more into philosophy, social withdrawal, etc.   This has stemmed from the metaphysical questions that philosophy tackles.  Topics relating to the ultimate reality, the existence of God, personal identity, etc.  As a 21 year old in college, it seems that no one is wondering about these things.  Hell, but reading philosophy is absolutely crushing me and making me more distant from people.  It's as if I'm the most self-aware I've ever been and I'm starting to absolutely despise it. Plug me back into the Matrix for good; ignorance is indeed bliss. 

So basically, political, etc)?

First

Here at /r/philosophy we follow a stricter set of rules for submission:

*A submission will be removed if the submission is deemed by the moderators to be unrelated to the academic discipline of philosophy, information on particular philosophers, and so on.*

Second, ask your questions at /r/askphilosophy. The panelists will do their best to answer your questions or direct you to good resources. If you’re a student at a university, go to [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/), a high-quality resource. If you’re not a student, then there’s [PhilPapers](http://philpapers.org/). They’ve got thousands of free papers! 

Third, [Simple Wikipedia](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://www.iep.utm.edu/), [University of Chicago Podcasts](http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/podcasts/), or [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/) first. If you want a good primer on issues in moral philosophy, please check out [blackstar9000's post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/tkcyn/a_brief_primer_on_some_major_issues_in/).

Fourth, please remember that *you are not your opinions*. Furthermore, if you don’t think that you could possibly be wrong, then you are not in a debate. If you’re interested in the truth rather than winning an argument, you will try to find weaknesses in *your* arguments. Think first if your voice will *add to the discussion*. Respond to the argument and not the tone of the argument. On this subreddit, many people value being right over being nice.

Fifth, people will call you on it, and you’ll look like you don't think much. And that's bad. Philosophers like to think. Got it?

Sixth, you can explain to others why they’re being lazy; (2) if they clarify something they said, you might understand their point better. If you don’t ask for clarification, then you might be arguing against a stance that no one accepts, wasting everyone’s time and frustrating everyone.

However, philosophy could slip into obscurantism (and Heidegger certainly balances on this verge). I would personally love everybody to study philosophy, but the reality is that not everyone cares about many of the philosophical investigations. So why reduce philosophy to the level where it is intelligible for 'the common man'? This sounds terribly elitist, I know.

Being as Metaphysics' makes perfectly plain

So, ""as a scientist"", to get interested into this as, he claims, it provides a critical view of science. I'm a bit puzzled by the content of this text though, as it seems to be full of bollocks. Maybe you can help me to go beyond this first impression.

Here's the full text: http://evans-experientialism.freewebspace.com/heidegger8a.htm

The text starts with the statement :

&gt; Philosophy is metaphysics.

It that true ? I though there was quite some different branches in philosophy: http://philpapers.org/categories.pl

Then in paragraph  5. he goes about asking the main question of the text: ""What is meant by the talk about the end of philosophy?""

He explain that by ""end"" we shouldn't understand ""end""  (one could ask why use the word ""end"" in the first place then

Is that true

I don't really understand why he's saying this at this point

&gt;Throughout the whole history of philosophy

Again is that true? I mean I get that Platon is an important figure in philosophy but that seems a bit too simple to be true. What about say

Then he argue that the end of philosophy is characterized by the emergence of sciences from philosophy:

&gt;The development of the sciences is at the same time their separation from philosophy and the establishment of their independence. This process belongs to the completion of philosophy. Its development is in full swing today in all regions of beings. This development looks like the mere dissolution of philosophy

Do the emergence of sciences really look like the dissolution or completion of philosophy ? I mean philosophy seems quite diverse and incomplete to me

The argument for the establishment of science independence is:

&gt;It suffices to refer to the independence of psychology, to the role of logic as symbolic logic and semantics.

Are sciences really independent of philosophy? I had the - maybe naive - idea that at their bases their was always a lot of philosophy. 

Next statement:

&gt;Philosophy turns into the empirical science of man

Is philosophy really turned into an empirical science ? I think I've read some ideas about experimental philosophy

Next paragraph:

&gt;No prophecy is necessary to recognize that the sciences now establishing themselves will soon be determined and steered by the new fundamental science which is called cybernetics.

So

Well

That being said, ultimately, the particular thing which you are trying to determine the morality of, is merely a variable in the larger ethical equation, and it's that equation which determines the morality.

If someone asks ""Is political lobbying ethical?"", so it's ethical,"" the utilitarian redditor says, ""If you can prove that it is beneficial to the greater good, than sure, it's ethical,"" the freshman undergrad philosophy major redditor says, so no it's not ethical

Swap out ""political lobbying"" for just about anything, never more insightful than people inserting the particular topic into their pre-established ethical philosophy.

(Keep in mind also that the question is asking whether or not the thing is ethical, as it can almost be boiled down to a listing of the various moral philosophies' party statements.  The question will have no real answer, and so it is a bad question to ask.)

Ethics are certainly an important area of inquiry, analyze and debate the very moral groundwork that you disagree with, or perhaps more importantly the groundwork that you DO agree with.  Debates on the ethical systems themselves can be very productive, and they serve to give clearer answers to the particulars.  If you are really personally torn on a particular issue, then theoretically it should be because you aren't sure how your moral philosophy would handle that particular, and you could ask, ""Is political lobbying ethical according to utilitarians?"" which would be an appropriate

1. The argument was made that r/Philosophy was cluttered with memes, and other rubbish of little philosophical value; however, this rubbish was not limited to links and photographs only, and continues to be present in self-posts, as well. In terms of meaningful content, self-posts and links are equivalent.

2. Now that we are self-post only, from a glance, what websites content links to. If I see that a link is from imgur, and I'm not in the mood for a picture, I don't click on it. The self-direction of my own content consumption has been partly usurped.

3. The idea that the front-page is cluttered, and the distinction between first and second page is near meaningless. Removing content for the mere reason of clutter seems like using a canon to kill a mosquito.

4. The idea that memes, ""A serious and good philosophical work could be written consisting entirely of jokes."" It seems like r/Philosophy has sought fit to dismiss Wittgenstein in favor of their own aesthetic comfort, without adequately arguing against this idea.

5. Censorship. Functionally, a Philosophy sub-reddit should strive not to censor the philosophic views, comments, or beliefs of its members, and the medium by which someone chooses to express themselves is an integral element of their expression. This censorship was done in the name of philosophical heft, though -- as I mentioned in point 4 -- no sufficient argument was made to support this belief.

**TL;DR** The banning of specific content has done nothing to improve r/Philosophy

**EDIT:** 6. This very post is some of the same ill-reasoned, and yet it I #1 in r/Philosophy right now.

Looking at some of the top posts in [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) was truly a great way for me to increase my blood pressure. I just did it again after a few weeks

Just **why in the fuck** do they believe that the *foundationalistic, and to speak from an extreme point of view, even *knowledge* can be. I swear, they're all childish logical positivists of some sort. Note I'm using the term ""all"" rather *healthily*. 

This is pretty much what I see happening in r/atheism:

""Christianity and many other religions are false

""I don't believe in illogical things

""I only believe in science because empiricism and induction can stand up to anything""

""Science can answer just about everything""

""I only believe in what is real and what I can see""

""There is an objective truth out there""

""My beliefs are founded in science""

The examples I've given here are not exact copy/pastes

OK, they seem to be completely unaware of the contemporary problems of empiricism and naturalism. **Granted**, philosophers who were leading empiricists ALSO understood the philosophical problems of their beliefs, but chose to hold onto them, because they believed them to be the best way to obtain knowledge, DESPITE knowing its shortcomings. I have no fucking problem with this. In fact, this is what I fully support. 

But I don't see this happening in r/atheism. It's all circular arguments in there. The fact that they are so damned sure that their beliefs and propositions of how true knowledge is obtained is absolutely correct is what makes me &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;. **Any** attempts to show them the weakness in such thinkings through using good epistemology and perhaps even logic is shot down, ragecomics are made that make fun of this ""retarded child-like logic"", *ad nauseam*. It literally feels like as if the.... *gasp* ...us ""liberal arts majors"" with an elementary background in philosophy are infinitely more rational and reasoning than the people in r/atheism.

The move is ostensibly to save money, but the numbers don't add up- the philosophy program turns a profit and Drs. Mills and Graves sell more credit hours per-professor than most other departments on campus.

As a lot of  what s/he touched on was first-order stuff. And there are lots of discussions debates on here that have some implicit metaethical assumptions



**What is Metaethics?** 

Metaethics (also spelled meta-ethics) or second-order ethics consists in questions about ethics itself. ""Meta"" in Greek means a number of different things. However in the sense it used here (and used mostly today), metaphysical, linguistic (or semantic), and psychological. 

To give an example

* Jane utters ""stealing is wrong""

This is a first order claim, or in this case ought *not* to do: steal.

* If John responds ""is it really wrong? On what grounds do you make this claim?""

This is now a metaethical question. As the question is no longer about what we ought or ought-not do (first-order); rather it is now about the reasons/baseline assumptions and what she means when she makes this claim (second-order).

**The Relationship Between Metaethics and Ethics**

Now that you (hopefully) have a basic understanding of the difference between first and second-order ethics

&gt;First and second-order views are not merely distinct but completely independent: one could be a second-order moral skeptic without being a first-order one, while believing that they were simply attitudes and policies with regard to conduct that he and other people held. Conversely, a man could reject all established morality while believing it to be an objective truth that it was evil or corrupt. 

So for example, [*Maryland v. King*](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-207_d18e.pdf) saw a lot of agreement between conservatives and liberals about the use of DNA testing (the consensus being that it's a violation of liberties) but if asked to explain their reasons for holding this position, each side would give very different answers. 

**Naturalism v. Non-Naturalism**

So the nature of moral facts is very contentious. It's divided into two main camps

* Naturalism: the view that moral facts correspond to the some features of the natural world. e.g. good, etc.

On the flip side

* Non-Naturalism: the view that moral facts correspond to something beyond or different than any feature of the natural world. 

Non-Naturalism might strike you as something similar to the Platonic Forms, the term pleasant and good. It is an open question if something that is pleasant is good. But thinking something is pleasant isn't the exact thing same as to think it's good so we must be attributing distinct properties to good. Which leaves the question open as to whether or not facts are natural or non-natural (This is G.E. Moore's open question argument). 

**Cognitivism v. Non-Cognitivism**

This is a semantic argument about whether our moral claims have any cognitive (truth-value) to them. 

* Cogntivists: claim that an utterance like ""Rape is wrong."" is either true or false. Regardless of which answer you give

A quick side-note: cognitivism is interesting in that it is the assumed mode of moral talk. When we discuss issues it is almost always in terms of right/wrong (true/false). This isn't to say that this makes cognitivism correct

* Non-Cogntivism (Expressivism/Emotivism): Is the claim that an utterance like

Hume stands (contentedly so) as a possible progenitor non-cognitivist. He thought that our judgments only ever expressed our passions. If we claim that there is no cognitive content to moral claims

**Reasons Debate**

One of my personal favorites. There are two predominant views again (notice a trend?) Reasons internalism and reasons externalism. First lets talk reasons

* Normative reasons are the reasons we have for action 

and 

* Motivating reasons are the reasons that explain why we acted the way we did. 

When an agent's normative reasons are her motivating reasons she is fully rational. Bernard Williams is a prominent (and perhaps the most prominent) reasons internalist. 



* Reasons Internalism: we only ever have reasons (moral or non-moral) to act when we have a desire in our motivational set

So motivation precedes reason on this internalist account. Contrasting this with 

* External reasons, remain normative regardless of an agent's motivations, are exemplified by things such as well-being, duty, logical thinking, etc. 

Where the two overlap is that they (often) agree that irrationality obtains when an agent's normative reasons are not her motivating reasons. There are lots of sub-tangents regarding weak-will or self-deception that follow from irrationality. But for now all you need to know that there are either external normative reasons

Derek Parfit's most recent book has quite a large section on Reasons (if anyone wants it I have the PDF) and really does well to lay out what's going. Basically some of the implications are, helping someone who's about to drown, If I don't have the motivations/desire to do so. To some this sounds crazy, and I can see why. (Personally I find myself somewhat sympathetic to Internalism, though that maybe because of my affinity for Williams). On the flip side internalism explains things like accepting Singer's argument for vegetarianism, but not taking yourself to have any reason to give up meat. 

**Moral Responsibility and Moral Luck**

This can get a bit thorny as there are some very nuanced free will debates that encompass everything from hard determinism (that is we have zero free will) to compatibilism (a mix of freewill and determinism) to radical freewill (something that Sartre advocates). However our concern here is with the conditions of Moral responsibility and they immediately lead to issues of moral luck. 

Prima facia, when we look at the brute luck that Jack experienced (say he came from a poor family, absent parents, no other tenable options) it seems that luck has had a heavy hand in determining the outcome. I liken it to having a buffet with a few shitty options, Jack seems somehow less responsible for his poor eating habits if all he ever has in front of him is spam, a big mac, and Oreos. So the debate here isn't quite as clear cut, is an untenable position) and there are those who want to varying degrees of moral responsibility relative to the choices an agent had (this is something like my own view) and there are those who say ""to hell with responsibly

**Relativism v. Objectivism**

The last thing I'll touch on is moral objectivism v. relativism. Where we say

* Objectivism: the view that moral facts are objective/normative regardless of human ascent or cultural agreement. 

For example, genocides, etc.) draws out an objectivist intuition that, yes, there are somethings like rape, murder, genocide, like I've pointed out there can be first order consensus for those who have divergent second-order views)

* Relativism: The view that morals are constructed and relative to a given culture/society/small group. They do not exist outside of culture

So consider any of the differing putative moral disputes between cultures. In the middle east it's not uncommon for men to marry 12

There really is no sense of individuality though

For instance, but no one would feel as if they had any sort of individuality or originality in the society they lived in, there would also be a great amount of competition. Or if you lived completely by yourself in the wilderness, you'd never have anybody to compare yourself to, you wouldn't know how well you clicked with another human being or if your personality was ""correct"" by anybodies expectations, but I digress. 

Say for instance you're extremely depressed, this world is cold and brutal, I've been fucked over time and time again, and I really see my life going no where."" Right then and there you pick up the gun, point it at your head and shoot yourself in the face.

What exactly is the significance of that? It's one of the most radical decisions you could possibly make, there would be no reflection or sorrow, there wouldn't even be peace or serenity. All those words are descriptions of concepts we feel as a human entity.

&gt;For, so popular morality separates strength from the manifestations of strength, as if behind the strong person there were an indifferent substrate, which is free to express strength or not. But there is no such substrate; there is no ""being"" behind the doing, acting, becoming. ""The doer"" is merely made up and added into the action – the act is everything. People basically duplicate the action: when they see a lightning flash, that is an action of an action: they set up the same event first as the cause and then yet again as its effect.

That seems to be very similar with Buddhist non-duality stance (from wikipedia)

&gt;Non-Self in Buddhism is the Non-Duality of Subject and Object, there is just hearing. No hearer and nothing heard.” (Bahiya Sutta, Udana 1.10). Non-Duality in Buddhism does not constitute merging with a supreme Brahman, but realising that the duality of a self/subject/agent/watcher/doer in relation to the object/world is an illusion.

Which lastly brings us to Wittgenstein and one of his most know propositions:

&gt;4.003 Most of the propositions and questions to be found in philosophical works are not false but nonsensical. Consequently we cannot give any answer to questions of this kind

This is a follow-up to [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/auy6j/tomorrow_i_will_have_lunch_with_my_philosophy/)

It was the first time I had seen him since he revealed he was a “young earth creationist” on the last of class in December.  He looked genuinely glad to see me, as I never would have guessed he was such a religious man. Curiously, he thanked me and said he was just doing his job. He then expressed his belief in the importance of conversation and never shying away from hard questions.

I brought with me 5 pages of comments from my initial posts in /r/atheism and /r/philosophy and presented it to him. There were many very good statements, but I did try to find out how he came to his worldview. So I asked about his childhood.

He told me he was raised in North Texas, educated in the church and had never known any other life. He said I could call it ‘indoctrination’ if I wanted.

I confronted him about having a presupposition, so I moved on.

He continuously insisted that the bible is perfectly consistent,000 years ago to resemble a planet that is billions of years old; rocks with depleted carbon14, fossils in sandstone, canyons, mountains, and a moon with millions of meteor craters.  He cited a discovery of helium in the Grand Canyon that provides evidence for his hypothesis.

Our time ran short, and does not participate in protest and the like, but he believes the ‘scriptures’ are very clear about things such as homosexuality. Then, almost apologetically, expressed disappointment that the government played a role in marriage at all. 

I felt we both could have stayed much longer

1330617281.0,qd0qv,What Minesweeper Tells Us About Thinking,brinton,174,55,48,"*Posted with permission from author Christina Epperson*

Taking classes from home through the wonder of the internet

If you don't know how Minesweeper works, which ends the game, or a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to that space. When the game begins, the player is forced to take a shot in the dark, much like the young person seeks to find his own beliefs wherever he or she can. Sometimes things work out okay, and sometimes the thinker gets burned by the consequences of making an incorrect choice. The thinker usually learns from his early mistakes, and the player can of course just start the game anew. Eventually the player finds an open space, just as the young person eventually finds a system of belief on which he or she can agree with others

The large revealed area gives the player enough information to begin to see how the system of pieces fits together, and how they are congruous or incongruous to the world, and will thus refine the edges of his or her thinking to match the available data. As long as one thing leads easily to the next, he or she learns a lot very quickly, easily avoiding the pitfalls inherent in life.

Eventually the game becomes more difficult. A solid row or column of indicators indicates a large number of adjacent mines, but by determination of where they cannot be. Logical inconsistencies will help the player eliminate certain spaces as having mines, and he can reveal those spaces, just as logical inconsistencies can be identified in certain beliefs in the real world, and those beliefs can be eliminated so that the thinker may move closer to the truth, and avoid the consequences of making the wrong choice in a difficult situation.

Finally a point will come in the game, where no amount of logic will determine the way forward. There simply isn't enough information to determine whether a given space contains a mine, just as in real life there is sometimes simply no way the thinker can be sure he or she is making the correct choice. When this occurs, usually late in the game, the player is forced to determine the probability that a given move is correct, and choose to reveal the spaces that have the lowest probability of being mines. Given that situation, the adept critical thinker will adopt the belief or action that is most likely to be correct.

At the very highest level of play

All of this is a simplification, thus winning the game. In life, benefits and consequences are widely variable. Indeed, the priorities of a given thinker may make one set of benefits and consequences preferable to those chosen by a different thinker. What is important is that each thinker clearly defines his or her priorities, so that the benefits sought and consequences avoided are the most important to him or her. The thinker must seek information to determine how the chosen course will impact those priorities, and to what degree.

Just as in Minesweeper, by looking at how all the adjacent pieces fit together. Only by determining what makes sense for all the surrounding pieces, can the best possible choice be made. In life, there are far-reaching ramifications to the choices we make. In most cases, however, the most impact occurs closest to the field in which the decision is made. As the ramifications reach farther, their impact becomes less. Ramifications are also buffered by the fact that, the individual choices made by one tend to have little overall effect. Still, how best to use his or her own influence to effect the changes in the whole system that he or she has prioritized. If that process is completed,

I have serious concerns regarding my transition from Christianity to Agnosticism. I grew up in a very Christian family. I called myself a Christian and was very into doctrine and missions and believed myself to be born again and what not. 

Over the last year

I see good evidence for both. I see the pluses and minuses in each. BUT I have also seen liars, and people who twist the truth on BOTH sides. The truth is distorted.. what can I know? 

I basically came to a point where I believe that there is absolute truth but it is impossible to find it. (It is interesting because I claim that I don’t know if I can know the truth
People that are much more brilliant than I have come to different conclusions: Dawkins, Darwin, ect.. How am I, a person of inferior knowledge, going to find out the truth? Again, I do believe there is absolute truth, and I just can’t accept that there isn’t. 

Being a skeptic is horrible. I find answers nowhere. I find peace nowhere. I am so used to this idea of God and have been so indoctrinated that I don’t think I can accept that there is no God.

I am lost and confused and am very depressed. 

Have any of you experienced this same dilemma? How did you overcome it?

Those who loved with all their heart and mind might have always thought of death

The life I want is a life I could not endure in eternity. It is a life of love and intensity

If I ask myself who in history I might like to have been

As one deserves a good night's sleep

For most of us death does not come soon enough. Lives are spoiled and made rotten by the sense that death is distant and irrelevant. One lives better when one expects to die, when one says to oneself long before one is twenty: whatever I may be able to accomplish, I should be able to do by then; and what I have not done by then, I am not likely to do ever. One cannot count on living until one is forty - or thirty - but it makes for a better life if one has a rendezvous with death.

Not only love can be deepened and made more intense and impassioned by the expectation of impending death; all of life is enriched by it. Why deceive myself to the last moment, and smells only when it is almost too late? In our treatment of others, too, it is well to remember that they will die: it makes for greater humanity.

There is also, at least in western tradition, an aspect of reserve--that is, this sense of openness is to be reserved simply for one person for it to be meaningful. The word love in this sense also seems to have an element of commitment, as in, no matter what this relationship leads to, within reason

Now I could go on, it is to be felt not said. But that doesn't seem right to me, surely love can be expressed somehow? I suppose it may only possible to express it through actions rather than words, which might be a good thing? I don't know.

I've been pondering this for a while. From what i can tell, or publicly. 

It makes me wonder if the only way perfect governance can be achieved is through some form of artificial intelligence. I read fairly often in r/politics about sentors who vote for bills without reading them or those who vote for things which later financially benefit them in some way. The human element here is so strong

It starts me down a path of thought where i wonder if the things that make me human and a functional animal existing under the ""survival of the fittest"" coding could operate safely under the ""survival of all"" (like ants) mantra. If not, if i am more interested...on a genetic level, in the betterment of myself and my own offspring. 

The only place i can fathom this going to find coherent ideology and execution is in an artificial life form which is solely tasked with the survival of all mankind and the happiness of all. A machine can be designed to do just abut anything and that includes learn and become free thinking. There is an equation there somewhere in how we think/learn and as long an artifical intelligence understands that its own survival rests on our survival (the human species) then would it not be able to more competently and more completely define laws and govern all of us?

A few more thoughts to justify this:

- Artificial intelligence could ""think"" or ""debate"" 24/7 thousands of times faster then a human.

- Artificial intelligence would not have gentic instincts which could sway its decisions.

- Artificial intelligence would Be (more then likely) an entirely logical machine and not an emotional one.

1371925698.0,1gv7ud,Is Music a Universal Language?,wlongabaugh14,195,82,97,"Here is (a fair amount of) a paper I wrote on music and language:

____________________________________________________________

“Music is the universal language.” Aphoristic as this phrase may be, exactly, does music express? For that matter, how does music express? Is the content or manner of expression of music the same as the content or manner of expression of language? In answering questions such as these, we promote previously empty cultural aphorisms about music like the one presented earlier to the status of meaningful claims.

David Lewis highlights two important features of language – language as an object and language as a practice. I will present a view of the nature of music held by Peter Kivy, though it has more language-like properties than Kivy admits.

To briefly take stock

1.	Syntax – Lewis’ grammar operations. Determine legitimate strings.
2.	Semantics – Lewis’ meaning. The meaning of a well-formed string is the situation it describes in a set of possible worlds.
3.	Truth Values – Derived from comparing the meaning of a sentence with our world.
4.	Conventional Activity – a population arbitrarily determines a language used by conventionally using the language to express truth.

Peter Kivy endorses a formalist view of music. The formalist doctrine is that music is a type of sound structure. Generally, sound structures are just combination of types of sounds (such as pitches, percussion, etc.) that occur in some timeframe. Music has formal properties and sensuous properties: a piece of music’s formal properties differentiate it from other pieces of music; i.e. certain notes are played in a certain order, the piece is a certain speed, and there are certain rhythms. And music’s ‘sensuous properties’ boil down to the fact that – shocker – music is a heard medium: we hear and notice different aspects of sound events when we experience music.

Kivy’s view of music directly supports the inclusion of one of the important features of language in music’s nature. He says that music has a “special kind of order: the order of syntactical structure.”  He says that this order is governed by rules (of a sort); these rules concern how different sounds should be combined in the production of a musical work. For example, and not in others – for example, you will see flat V chords used in chord progressions in jazz, but not most pre-modern forms of classical music.

But I think we have reason to believe that the nature of musical syntax is very similar to the nature of linguistic syntax. First of all, prominent writers have violated it throughout history (E. E. Cummings is one obvious example), and people today often violate it when talking to one another through electronic media such as texting on the phone and messaging online. I think we still want to say that these people are using English – they are just temporarily disregarding a grammar rule of English, which is more of a regularity than a law. However, though some rules of linguistic syntax are not absolutely strict, I do think that there are rules which are inviolable. Lewis’ rule that there is a finite set of elementary constituents paired with meanings that we can use in the construction of sentences is of paramount importance when using a language. I can’t type out a random assortment of characters and expect that configuration to be an English sentence.  Similarly, certain combinatorial grammar rules are absolute.

And it seems to me that musical syntax has very similar characteristics to this conception of the characteristics of linguistic syntax. There are certain rules which can be bent; a piece of music can preserve its status as a piece of music in a certain genre regardless of whether it follows a specific syntactic ‘regularity’ of this kind. This is similar to syntactic rules like capitalization mentioned in the previous paragraph. Then there are certain rules which must be followed for a piece to be classified as a member of a certain genre – relate this to how a string must follow a certain instantiation of the grammar rules Lewis established to be characterized as a member of one language rather than another.  Then there are certain rules any genre of music must follow to be music rather than mere noise. This is similar to syntactic rules any language must have; a language must follow the general rules Lewis gives us

We can also see that the activity of music is analogous to the activity of ‘language’ that Lewis describes. Music is not just an entity, however limited that arbitrariness is by the hard-wiring of our brains to enjoy certain sounds. 

The parallels between music as ‘language’ do not stop there. Music shares the ability to infer something about the state of mind of a composer or musician with language (substituting ‘speaker’ for ‘composer or musician’). Playing a guitar solo in a minor pentatonic scale allows us to infer one (admittedly broad) set of things about the mind of the guitarist

So far, it’s not hard to see how a story could be told relating them – in every way but one: what could we say corresponds with the meanings described in rule one and two? Kivy qualifies his formalist definition of music: “absolute music is a sound structure without semantic or representational content”. 

This is a big problem for a proponent of the view that music is a language. One of the essential characteristics of language is its status as something which can communicate meaning; some might call this property the most important property of language. And on initial reflection, content-rich way a language can. Music could never have the power to express the meaning of such sentences as “My flight to Los Angeles was delayed because of poor conditions on the runway.” This is a crippling observation in particular for anyone who thinks that my method of deciding whether music is a language is valid – without sematic content, two of the four properties of language Lewis defined go down the tubes. The absence of semantic content in music obviously bars us from saying that music has semantics; and, because music is free of semantic content, truth values are gone as well, as truth values are products of comparing the meanings of sentences with the world.

The avid supporter of the music-as-language project has two avenues open to them at this point. They might object to Kivy’s view the music is free of semantic content; or

An obvious route someone objecting to Kivy’s determination that music is free of semantic content might take is saying that it does have semantic content – and this content is emotion. Music represents emotions the same way language represents the situations its sentences describe. Maybe the ability of music to describe things in the world is much more limited than language

Kivy has a response to this claim, and enhanced formalism, still, in spirit.”  He thinks that music can say nothing interesting or significant about emotion, and somehow this yields the result that music does not have emotional semantics. But the ability to say something interesting about what it denotes is not what defines the semantics of language – it is the ability to say what it says that defines language. In other words, it is the ability of sentences to denote at all which makes them linguistic. If music can do this, then it has semantic content.

The problem is, I can offer no positive reasons to accept this conception of emotion in music other than emotions are certainly a part of music in some capacity, and this formulation of their relation to music is the least problematic one I know of. 

And perhaps I can pose some problems with representative views of music that serve my intuitions well: for one, single-word emotional descriptor, which varies from person to person. Another thing people think stems from a representative medium is the presence of truth values. We can say of a linguistic proposition that it represents our world, or it represents a situation not in our world; propositions of the first type are true, and propositions of the second type are false. But what would we say about music corresponds with a state in the world? It seems a very odd practice to listen to a phrase in Beethoven’s Fifth and say of it that it is ‘true’ or ‘false’.
 
On the other hand, Philosophy, and Modernity. He says “if people understand a piece of articulation – which is apparent in terms of its effects in social contexts on behavior, reactions, feelings, and so on – it must mean something.”  Bowie equates language with Lewis’ ‘language’, the social activity, music has meaning

But Bowie betrays his own cause when he tells us what follows from this new definition of language in a quote by Bjørn Ramberg: “’We can, because others’ thoughts are influenced to think worse of me for being tardy. Playing a sport with other people is now language, because their behavior is altered when they respond to my sporting actions. Maybe you want to call these things language, but I suspect the majority of people do not.

It is important that a practice we choose to call language should have aspects of ‘a language’ and is used by the practice of ‘language’. This successfully delineates language from non-language. The presence of truly semantic content is one of the principle factors in deciding whether something is a language. Even though music seems to have every property of the practice Lewis identifies as ‘language’

1323174465.0,n2fpc,"The ""hard"" problem of consciousness",thinkahol,147,35,272,"I find the distinction between “hard” and “soft” problems illuminates more than anything how flabbergasted most people still are in contemplating crossing the objective/subjective divide. It illustrates how inconceivable bridging that explanatory gap has seemed to be. And that tells how little most of us still understand. It turns out, was really the last rational bastion of opposition to the scientific assertion that consciousness emerges from the brain.

The solution to the hard problem is rather simple. It has been so hard to see for certain evolutionary and cultural reasons. The solution is that the “self” is an illusion. The conscious part of us is actually a representational process. For simple reasons of caloric efficiency, from an existence far richer than we can perceive, information about the environment is taken in and an estimation of reality constructed. Other species construct a different map of the same external world from different sets of senses. Some have eyes tuned to a different slice of the electromagnetic spectrum. Some use echolocation, some are sensitive to electromagnetic fields, etc.

It isn’t at all the case for example that you “see with your eyes.” You see with your visual system. But we didn’t need to know that to survive. We didn’t need to know that when you saw a large feline predator of mostly orange coloring with black stripes, seeing a representation of a tiger. We just needed to know to get the fuck out of dodge. If you had a brain tempted to make the likely correct philosophical intuition that your experience of reality is actually virtual, those extra milliseconds could cost you your life while in danger, and in most cases, if not under direct threat, until very recently the extra caloric cost of that higher order thought process of a representation of a representation would just make you hungrier faster without much evolutionary benefit.

We are not just naive realists in our understanding of the external world, and the often magical explanations of consciousness. We don’t experience the neural underpinning of consciousness, and thus if what we experience is what is real, consciousness is inexplicable and magical. ”Any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic.” We just happened to be born in “technological” equipment like that.

The nature of agency itself is thus tied to the extent to which modern neuroscience may or may not be indicating that consciousness itself and hence all of rationality might function in the brain as a special kind of sense perception of the world. I recommend Thomas Metzinger’s Graduate Council lecture at UC Berkeley for a quick overview of the self-model theory of subjectivity. This is the first paragraph of his book

“This is a book about consciousness, but a process—and that subjective experience of being someone emerges if a conscious information-processing system operates under a transparent self-model. You are such a system right now, as you read these sentences. Because you cannot recognize your self-model as a model, it is transparent: you look right through it. You don’t see it. But you see with it. In other, more metaphorical, words, the central claim of this book is that as you read these lines you constantly confuse yourself with the content of the self-model currently activated by your brain.”[ii]

This explains the research that increasingly is indicating the extraordinary extent to which seemingly conscious decisions have been made before subjects think they consciously made these decisions. This seems to indicate that many so-called conscious decisions are actually ­subconscious and our conscious awareness is only being informed of the decision.  It is not that consciousness has no meaningful role to play in a our behavior, or the more we train ourselves in the daily practices of mindfulness.

Furthermore, and therefore the autonomy of our human entity is not externally determined (only confined), but that it is consciousness itself that has been shown to be increasingly more limited than traditionally expected. We don’t have bodies, bodies have us.

Interestingly enough, in witnessing the mind as an object, are stepping stones to a higher order consciousness, one that implicitly recognizes Metzinger’s scientific perspective. It might be more proper to say that mystical experiences are compatible with the self-model theory of consciousness, as indeed they would have to be if the model is any good. I do not want to suggest that Metzinger’s theory in any way implies universal consciousness or any other speculative metaphysics justified on experiential grounds. I speculate on the only way I could find universal consciousness rationally plausible elsewhere.

From the Publisher:
The Atlas of True Names reveals the etymological roots
of the familiar terms on today's maps of the World

For instance
the Atlas gives you ""The Tawny One""

The 'True Names' of 3000 cities, oceans and mountain ranges
are displayed on these four fascinating maps
each of which includes a comprehensive index of derivations.
Etymology, discourse, word”)
is the study of the origin and history of words.

For the first time
into familiar geographical names – with intriguing results......

Once the names have been taken back to their roots and translated into English
it is immediately apparent that our world has an extraordinary affinity with Middle-earth
the mythical continent where the events of Tolkien’s ‘The Lord of the Rings’ are played out.

Middle-earth’s evocative “Midgewater”
are strikingly similar in nature to Europe’s “Swirlwater”
as revealed by the Atlas of True Names.

Many geographical names are clearly rooted in Man’s observation of his natural environment;
the physical location of a settlement: “At the Foot of the Mountain” – Piedmont
the character of an important water course: “The Gentle One” – The Seine
or even just the local vegetation: “Under the Oaks” – Potsdam.

Unsurprisingly
often derive their names from the characteristics
of the people who lived there: “Great Land of the Tattooed” – Great Britain
whilst local mythology and regional rulers also frequently leave their legacy:
“Isle of the Monster’s Eye” – Peleponnese or “Illustrious Emperor” – Zaragoza.

Sometimes
‘nomen est omen’.
For instance Grozny - the Chechnyan capital which
over the last years
– translates as “The Awesome”.

The Atlas of True Names restores an element of enchantment
to the world we all think we know so well.
It takes the reader on a journey into the unknown –
a unique exploration of uncharted territory
in that familiar place we all know as ‘home’.

Take a look at the world through fresh eyes!

I originally just wanted to study psychology and minor in philosophy, not as a career. I also figured it could benefit me in the future if philosophy doesn't work out.

Every day, they will say I look, talk, and act like a professor. And that's perfect because it's what I want to do. That being said, I understand getting a job as a professor isn't all that easy. I assume I'll be having to get my doctorate, which is fine. But what will I do up to that point? Not only that, but the school I attend isn't nationally recognized for its philosophy program. It's not like I'm at Rutgers or Princeton or something. My school isn't a bad school, it's pretty highly acclaimed. But I'm just worried for when I apply to graduate programs and such on my way to my doctorate that I won't be taken as seriously as someone who attended a school with a more notable philosophy program. And I feel like the program I get into

After school, and do the 1-2 year commitment for that (depending on which one I join). It's something I think I would love doing (I try to be pretty involved in service and social justice), and I think it would help me out when applying for jobs and graduate programs, especially since some of those programs offer financial assistance for graduate programs. However, I'm not very confident at this time in my knowledge of philosophy. Granted, I'm only a sophomore in college and my grades are pretty good, but I feel like when I'm around other philosophy majors/professors, reason, controversial), stream-of-consciousness discussion. That's the part I love. The only problem is I feel like that's not good enough. And when I'm discussing a topic with other philosophy majors/professors (for instance

I value Justice defined by Aristotle as the principle by which society is ordered. This is the most important value when it comes to the discussion of government (and society in general) because it is the ultimate end to which all social institutions strive.

The entire reason we form society is to bring order and protection to our existence. Protection of citizens is of the upmost importance because if citizens are not protected nothing else matters. 

Just as government protects citizens from crime and invading armies it ought to protect its citizens equally from illness in order to ensure citizen's safety from domestic threats.

I believe that at its core, this is Aristotelian (especially related to Gadamer's relation to the element of application in *Truth and Method*), but that's besides the point.  The point rather is that I feel like Sartre is really getting at the heart of the matter: ethical models for tough decisions will consistently fail us.

The two examples--the student choosing between his dying mother and joining the resistance and the failed Jesuit--illustrate a wonderful point: that tough decisions are rife with context.

So whenever I talk to christian friends of mine about free will being impossible and Gods judgement therefore unfair they will come up with this definition argument

The only kind of free will that to me would justify sending people to hell for not believing in God would be a 100% free one. Because if free will isn't 100% some people have an unfair advantage in the faith struggle. 

So this would be my definition: Being able to make decisions outside the influence of your upbringing, chance and irrationality. 

But if we would have that, an irrational decision could not be free. Irrational decisions are being influenced by your personality and other stuff, which you didn't pick. The third type of decision is made by chance, which is, quite self-explanatory, not free.

So to me it seems that the only useful definition of free will is inherently impossible. I don't understand why people make such a fuss about the definition

As I was thinking about the concept of nothingness, as there can't be any laws. Laws would be something. So the laws of thermodynamics (or at least the idea that you can't have something out of nothing) wouldn't apply to nothingness. So there would be no laws saying what can and what can't be. Thus it would be possible for the universe to just pop into existance from nothingness.

The Rum Diary is a a rollicking farce based on Hunter S. Thompson's novel of the same name written in the early 1960's. It focuses on a young American journalist named Paul Kemp who ventures into sweaty, and stumbles into the middle of a major land acquisition deal.

Thompson said that his ""long lost"" novel (which wasn't published until 1998) had ""a romantic notion, drunken misadventures, drug-induced hallucinations, silky temptresses and bloody-eyed hangovers are more than enough to make you guffaw and forget your cares and worries - there is even an absurd diamond-encrusted turtle who makes a few guest appearances, and struck me as a perfectly insane image for this film. This is straight entertainment at its finest, no chaser.

But the diamond-crusted turtle also calls to mind a running theme of the film

At more than a few turns in the road


His mission to take down ""the bastards"" of the world is definitely fueled in part by his encounters with Sanderson, self-centered. He encrusts a turtle with jewels because he got the idea ""from a book,"" while locals starve everywhere around him - and, despite Kemp's reservations, he is drawn into Sanderson's shady plan to fill a local island with a mega-resort. 

This narrative could be read in any number of ways - socially, Kemp on psychedelics looking at a lobster.


The trippy scene - which fans of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas will instantly recognize - ends with a wobbly

This is an incredibly insightful and important statement - and deserves some exploration.

What Kemp (and really, and all of humanity: that we tend to sing about, aspire to, and worship the divine, but practice, fall into, and embody the monstrous. Pick up any newspaper and you'll see two facts: as a species, but we tend to be morally hideous.

This sets us apart from other animals - no other creature in this world prattles on about justice, mercy, and love. But we're also not angels - we're constantly exploiting, torturing, hating, and waging war against others. As Dostoevsky put it in The Brothers Karamazov: ""People talk sometimes of a bestial cruelty, but that's a great injustice and insult to the beasts; a beast can never be so cruel as a man, that's all he can do. He would never think of nailing people by the ears


This notion of man as both a monstrous and magnificent creature, he also did significant writing on matters of philosophy and theology - notably in his collection Pensées. 

In Pensées, low-down and high-minded.

We are wretched because we are ""full of pride, weakness, misery, and injustice."" Unlike other animals, we fall from moral ideals - not to moral neutrality, but to moral baseness - and the net result is unhappiness. As philosopher Peter Kreeft notes in his lengthy commentary on Pensées: ""Unhappiness is perhaps the most obvious and pervasive feature of experience. It was for Buddha...his very 'first noble truth' was that 'to live is to suffer; life is suffering [dukkha, out-of-joint-ness].' ""

But as Pascal writes

From our sink-hole of unhappiness, and we all want it. More often than not, this has manifested - a truth that is anthropological before being religious - in a cry for God.


Kemp in The Rum Diary seems to carry on Pascal's tradition - he notes that man is distinct in both his ""greatness"" and ""wretchedness

First, ""man is a living oxymoron: wretched greatness, great wretchedness, rational animal, mortal spirit, thinking reed."" Or, in Pascal's words: ""What sort of freak then is man! How novel, how chaotic, repository of truth
