As we walked up

We told an employee that it was my board and had been stolen. She got the manager, offered to tell us who sold them the board. He went to get the info, and came back in a totally different mood. All of a sudden he's starts throwing out terms like, ""chain of custody,"" and saying that since we didn't file a report (cops wouldn't take one) we couldn't prove it was ours. Dude watched a little too much Law and Order.  I mean, fuck, my wife is an attorney

His compromise was that I leave my name and phone number and the guy who had put my stolen board on consignment would call me and I could ""work it out."" Meaning

He continued to stone wall us

Now the board is on its way to an evidence locker in Wahiawa

You might be wondering what the hell this has to do with surfing, and he had ridden it back in his mountain biking days. It was my primary transportation to and from my university campus and was my go to for cardio days. Needless to say I loved the thing. It had its fair share of problems being 20 years old and all, slipping gears, brake locking etc. But I was able to fix most of them. I kept it clean, well oiled and it ran fine; it treated me so well up until yesterday when it was stolen out of my apartment complex's lock up. Well I'm actually not sure when it was stolen cause I hadn't ridden it in a few days; hurt my ankle playing basketball so I couldn't ride. I was devastated and my land lord told me there was nothing he could do except help me file a police report. So my day had just taken a turn for the worse, but here's where it turned around. 

Coincidentally I had scheduled to meet up with a dude to buy a used board off him. I didn't really want to go cause I was depressed, no dings, just a scratch on the finish that didn't even puncture). So instantly I perked up. 

We got to talking and I told him basically the story I told above. All of a sudden he's like, I didn't want him to have to drop the price just for me. He stopped as I was protesting and said, ""Dude, I've been in your position and someone I knew did me a solid, don't think of this as charity, just think of it as good will and pass it on when you get the chance."" The guy instantly became this sage like surf monk, I was so gracious I didn't even know what to say. Then he told me to wait where I was and he ran home real quick and grabbed me a set of old quad fins. At this point I was ready to build a statue in his honor

He probably doesn't know, and it may have been small and cold, but it was one of the best surfs I've had in the last few years. So in honor of that dude I wrote this, hopefully passing on some of the stoke.

You've probably got a ton of questions, we've got you covered.  Wax goes on the bottom, leash on your left wrist.

But, and to keep the subreddit from getting flooded with identical posts, the whole /r/surfing community got together a few months ago and made an FAQ.  I think we did a great job, and while it's been posted on the sidebar for a while, it was at the bottom, where you couldn't really see it.

So, it's on there.  I could link to it here, but I don't want to, because I took the trouble of putting it over there.

 *A no expense paid trip to the North Shore of Oahu, I'll give you a place to stay and show you around the North Shore.  Board may be provided, depending on the size and ability level of the winner.  WARNING:  I will make you surf, even if it's big.  Shit, especially if it's big.

On 9/30/2011 I lost my best friend of 25 years. He was my brother in every sense of the word. We didn't grow up near the ocean

The love of surfing has taken us many places and to different countries. He took a solo trip to California and on his way home the racks he had borrowed from my dad years prior had finally failed and broke. Here is the post he left on [Swaylocks](http://www2.swaylocks.com/node/1013080)

""if anyone happens to come across a few Surfboards by Trill, 9'6"" sky blue opague lam, 8'4"" blue swirl deck inlay. just curious to see if they made it to the water instead of some trucker's basement..........thanks""

Needless to say he's been looking for these boards ever since. I know it would mean the world to his family to have these boards returned but I also realize this is probably a one in a million shot.

Thanks.

1351395243.0,127dfh,/u/sosleepysotired is a fucking killer,dumbassthenes,61,11,19,"

I enjoy redditors coming out to surf with me.  In the last few years I've had more than a few people come to visit

Each time I've seen people rise to the occasion, much more powerful and intimidating than what they deal with at home.

Yesterday took it to another level.

/u/sosleepysotired hit me up to come surf, I agreed to show him around.  One downside to the life I live, writing for money, and surfing and diving whenever I want, is that everyone else has real jobs.  They're busy, and I get a little lonely.  So I jump at the chance to have a new friend to fuck around with.  If that's seems kind of needy, well

It was crazy to find that he was my brother in law's best friend growing up.  He and I went to high school together.  I knew him

I've lived on the North Shore long enough to have a serious problem judging wave size.  Suffice to say, to understate things, he charged.

His board forced him to sit inside, he kept getting caught.  And paddling back out after.

I was, strength, and determination.  He earned a ton of my awe, respect, and above all, a friendship I won't soon forget.

You kill it

1339926122.0,v6a5v,r/surfing got a makeover. What do you think?,blackkettle,54,6,35,"You may have noticed that r/surfing looks a little different today than it did the last time you stopped by.  We've updated the look and feel of pretty much the entire subreddit.  The changes apply to [r/surfing](http://www.reddit.com/r/surfing)

Love it? Hate it?  Don't give a hoot? 

Let us know what you think.

## The 10

We made quite a few changes

 * Customized the colors
 * Added a custom header image
 * Added a custom subreddit image
 * Added a submission advisory
 * Added custom link flair to the submissions
 * Added a footer image - scroll to the bottom
 * Added a sidebar image
   * The sidebar image is something we'd like to cycle based on great subscriber submissions.
 * Added a sticky note
   * The sticky content will probably change from time to time, upcoming AMAs, surveys, etc.  For now make sure you check out the [surf-off](http://www.reddit.com/r/surfing/comments/uf35b/announcing_the_great_reddit_surf_off).

 
## Bugs

This is the first release so there are bound to be bugs that we missed.  In particular, preferably with an accompanying screenshot and a detailed description of your system configuration.

**Known bugs and rough edges**:

 * The favicon flair for the submitted links are slightly clipped in IE8 and Firefox.
 * The custom 'advisory' image for the submission page is not displayed in IE8.
 * The corners of the sticky note at the top of the page are nicely rounded in Chrome
 * ~~The alien is frazzled.  The alien is also getting a makeover at the moment.~~
 * ~~The sticky overflows on smartphone browsers.  This seems a bit tricky due to CSS limitations reddit imposes.~~

## A work in progress

We've come quite a ways, but if you do, please also include a link to the original, so we can add a pointer to it in the stylesheet.  No prizes or anything, but if you submit something and it gets adopted, you'll get a shout out in the stylesheet.  And of course you'll be able to bask in the glory of your contribution every time you visit r/surfing.

 * **Up/Down arrow** replacements.  This is the big one.  If you want to contribute something here please consider the following:

   * The default size of the arrows is **15x15 px**.  Anything up to **20x20 px** is probably workable

   * The icons are small

   * If you want to submit arrow replacements, **DownNotClicked**, **DownClicked**.  However the arrows also support a hover state, so we can also use **UpNotClickedHover**, **UpClickedHover**, **DownNotClickedHover**, **DownClickedHover** images.

   * The icons should obviously be related to surfing in some way

 * **'Submit a link'** button replacements.  Default

 * **'Create your own community'** button replacements.  Default

 * **Other.**  Are there other aspects of the site that we can customize but aren't even aware of?  Let us know.

## Credit where credit is due

The great majority of the CSS code as well as most of the images were pilfered from other subreddits or the great wide internet.  Special mentions go out to [r/reddithax](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddithax), [r/skyrim](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim), [r/fitness](http://www.reddit.com/r/fitness) and [r/trees](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees).  Image credits for everything not made by us can be found in the [stylesheet](https://gist.github.com/2944050).  Also see the [stylesheet](https://gist.github.com/2944050) if you are interested in all the gory details, or are a CSS guru and would like to scream and yell at us for our ugly code.

## TLDR;
r/surfing got a makeover.

## Edit:
Welcome to version 2.0.  There is a wave in the header.  The header and footer images should look better on larger monitors.  The sidebar styling is in better agreement with the rest of the page.  The font shouldn't look quite as retarded in RES night mode.",,t5_2qmde,1340543916.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/surfing/comments/v6a5v/rsurfing_got_a_makeover_what_do_you_think/
