Your friendly Moderator nicolauz here. Welcome to the Dead Space Reddit Community ! We've gotten quite a few new members in the past few weeks (actually about 800 in January alone !). Just wanted to go over a few ground rules for the release of the long awaited Dead Space 3. 

* **Discussion:**We highly encourage discussion and differing opinions are a great thing


* **Let's Play video's:** We understand that a large swath of people enjoy doing their own ""Let's Play"" or Video Blog videos and show people themselves getting scared playing DS. We also realize that they get posted here very often

* **Co-op Partners**: One of the mod's will also do a weekly (Monday) post if you're interested in finding a co-op partner in the sub here. (unless I can get text/image flair to work).

* **SPOILER POLICY**: This is a big one. It's understandable for you to get excited about a certain thing you found in game

* **Questions**: If you have specific questions, enemies or weapons please refer to the Dead Space wiki: [found here](http://deadspace.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page)

So to be thrust into this life or death situation with alien zombies trying to kill you when you aren't a skilled soldier can be pretty scary.

1364614284.0,1ba95p,A couple interesting things from the Dead Space Art and UI talks at GDC today,sigfemseks,49,7,12,"I went to two GDC talks about Dead Space this morning

- The Objective tracker line that Isaac projects onto the ground was a last minute addition to the first game

- Dead Space 2 originally had a vending machine that you could stick your arm in

- Another cut aspect from Dead Space 2 was the ability to hack ATMs for credits.

- The pop up UI system (inventory

- Dead Space 2 initially included 3 different types of nodes

- The background of Dead Space 1's main menu was set to include some very graphic and intense scenes of a person transforming into a Necromorph, they filmed themselves disemboweling these carcasses and breaking bones and things. A couple of filters later, we ended up with the current main menu backgrounds. Go check it out.

- Someone asked about the visor light being projected into the environment

- Much of the UI talk was about how they strived to make the UI diagetic, but for Isaac as well. This was a huge point they made, and the speaker was very sad that they couldn't make the crafting in DS3 work in a way that included Isaac in the frame physically putting the weapon together, but they did try. They went through many, many, many iterations before finally realizing it wasn't possible to have him be in the frame while also having an easy to use crafting system.

Companies NEED to draw in a bigger crowd. Dead Space 1 didn't sell amazingly well, and are more interested in that than anything (Dead Space 2's launch trailer had SMASHING PUMPKINS playing over it for god's sake). They NEED to show something new and exciting at E3 for the crowd. 

They expect the fans to expect that the series will already have the trademark dark corridors and distant noises (they have stated as such in magazine articles)

* ""Co-op isn't scary"" - Then don't play co-op? The previews have stated that single player is the main focus. If you don't wanna play co-op, and the way the game plays out will be different to adjust for this. The executive producer said the story will play out exactly the same, but certain scenes will be altered depending on whenether John Carver is present. 

* ""People are shooting at you now"" - How do we know this comprises the whole game? How do we know they can't make this fit into the horror atmosphere? I see people's concern here the most

* ""The ice planet isn't scary"" - Once again, read how they're formed. Pretty fucked up). That looks pretty Dead Spac-ey to me. I could be wrong, but I have no clue, because I haven't played it. 

I think the only reason it aggravates me is that so many people are on their high horse saying they won't buy it

And no

I should first point out that I beat DS1 15-ish times, I stand by my claim.

I beat DS3 on Normal in just over 12 hours

It was a great experience.

It was not as good as Dead Space 2.

**EDIT:** Protip: always have a Torque Bar with you. If you played DS2 you know the utility of keeping one power node at all times, and you frequently even get the raw materials back as well.

**EDIT EDIT:** I've gotten a few questions about suits in the game, all unlocked automatically throughout the game for free, with only cosmetic differences. Upon completing the game (on normal, at least) you unlock one more suit from a past game. However, unlike Dead Space 2, on a new playthrough the original five suits **do not** have special ""Elite"" versions. So, unless something changes near the end, however

The resource bots in dead space don't get attacked by necromorphs. At all. Despite the fact that they are constantly making notice and even shine light on feeders if deployed by them. This leads to the implication that necromorphs only kill to support convergence

So why don't humans just use robots to fight the necromorphs? I'm mainly talking about Tideman in dead space 2(the ONLY group of people who new about necromorphs BEFORE suffering an outbreak). They should already be using robots for mining. The advantages are overwhelming:

- No need for constant time spent in the vacuum of space or planets like Tau Volantis
- No Feeders or are least less of them! More rations for the robot managers!
- A better method for deep space explorations (robots don't need to be put in stasis to pass time while traveling in deep space).
- A faster and more detailed report about what happens during a necromorph outbreak as robots will be ignored. Therefore supporting any attempts to regain control of an outbreak.
- Robots can be programmed to only attack dead tissue that has been reanimated(robot sees dead person moving? RIP HIS ARMS OFF!)
- Did I say less feeders?

1. Relatively sure weapons don't ""max out"" when the gauges are full. Tested using a chain gun with lots of +clip chips and attachments


2. Your weapon reload speed is based off of your upper weapon, any +reload bonuses apply to your whole gun regardless of where it is placed (this is slightly obvious, but I will admit that I overlooked this initially).


3. When increasing rate of fire for semi-automatic guns


4. Scavenger bots will still give you resources regardless of where you release them. You can even release them when it shows no resource nodes nearby


5. MK-V parts are currently the best attachments and modules you can get. Also has the best (non-preorder/non-dlc) weapon tips. The weapon tips give +rate of fire, like the javelin gun). The module bonuses vary.


6. The 'best' frames in the game are the Compact Earth Gov Frame (+rate of fire), the only way to craft more of these frames, is by creating a blueprint of a weapon that uses them, and then crafting it.",,False,self,1360523801.0,t3_188sab

1362972159.0,1a27ug,Norton's Character,ForTheWilliams,35,3,12,"(Forgive the wall of text.)

I wanted to talk a bit about Norton's character. 

I feel a bit more willing to give him the benefit of the doubt than a lot of other people seem to he

In fact, as evidenced by his boyish enthusiasm when the Eudora swoops in for the rescue early on), and he didn't seem one to turn down good ideas, even if he wasn't the one to come up with them (early on, at least). I did lose respect for him as things went on, but I also think that his behavior could have been a bit of a tragic fall, not just Norton being an ass.

-----------

He definitely has some character flaws, he reacts in the same ways I think a lot of people I'd like to call good easily could have. 

Not only was Ellie showing a distressing amount of attachment and concern for Isaac (even shaking Norton's hand off her shoulder when she sees Isaac for the first time), and Norton is probably feeling a bit overshadowed as a result. This further amplifies the issues with Ellie, as it is her *ex* who is showing him up.

In the end, and his very *existence* is being threatened. Bombarded not only by ego-threats but threats to his and his crews very lives, he breaks down and just wants to get away from every one of those threats. From the planet, from the Necromorphs, and finally, from Isaac. 

--------------

His skepticism about the team's plans and ability to carry them out wasn't exactly irrational either. They *were* facing terrible odds. Even just getting down to the planet to begin with was not only extremely risky

Once they got there, function, or origin of which they didn't even have a passing understanding of. In fact, [had they actually succeeded in doing what they'd *initially* set out to do, they would have doomed the entire human race](/spoiler ""DS3""). The risks and degree of uncertainty associated with what they were trying to do were both huge. Moreover, the only evidence the had to go on was some scrawls on a wall and Isaac's touched-in-the-head-edness, both of which could be rightly viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism. Ultimately, but given the unknowns beforehand

----------------

He certainly doesn't make the *right* calls later on, but by that point he had so many weights bearing down on him that I could appreciate even a person I knew and respected more than Norton could react much the same way.

----------

On an somewhat related note, and even expecting, that it was actually going to be Santos. She was *astoundingly* chipper given the circumstances (before the lift scenes at least), and she was also perhaps a *bit* too enthusiastic about delving into the frozen Nexus experiment; I was seriously expecting her to be a committed Unitologist who was, once again, using Isaac to do their work (re-awakening the Nexus, getting information about the machine for Danik's purposes, as betrayals almost always seem to have

1364776086.0,1be07v,Combat tips for DS3 players.,CaptThack,33,2,6,"Here are some things that I think will help new players of DS3. From vets of the series to new players overall:

• Respect every aspect of stasis:

Veterans of Dead Space understand me when I say that stasis has been nerfed. And its been nerfed HARD. But this does not mean u can ignore it and have a easy time through the game. ALL necromorphs except for Exploders(yellow arms) and Lurkers(three tentacle heads) immediately charge you in this game. Having an unlimited means of slowing them down is invaluable. You can increase the effect by using it more than once on the same enemies aka ""stacking"" it. This gives it the same power and slowness as earlier Dead space games. On a more advanced note ALWAYS shoot it at a necros feet instead of its body. This helps with the splash effect it has and prevents missing altogether. Respect your stasis and win the game.

• Almost all of the ""tools"" have been nerfed in favor of the ""weapons"":

Obviously an effect of EA's producers (it seems an attempt to coddle newer players). This is most noticeable with the Plasma Cutter and Line Gun. The PC even sounds less lethal than previous games. This being said it still pays off to dismember enemies instead of just shooting them and the tools make that much easier. So do not rely on ammo eating military engines if you are new and get a feel for how Dead Space is played.

• Rely less on shooting necromorphs with their own limbs: 

The act of shooting dismembered limbs is a great way to save ammo, much more risky. Using stasis first is strongly advised but not necessary for better players. I remember in DS2 I was able to shoot off limbs and catch them in midair to shoot before necromorphs could even recover from flinching off of the first shot. Sadly, this is much more difficult even early in the game with a strong Planet Cracker.

• IMMEDIATELY make a blueprint for the planet cracker!!! 

For some reason in my game if I remove the rotator from the Planet Cracker I cannot put another one on it. So just make a blue print of it if you mean to experiment. Oddly this does not happen with other free guns like the Negotiator. 

• Scavanger bots runs are always worth it: 

Never neglect your scav bots. They gather plenty of tungsten(the hardest material to find in the game) and bring you the very important ration seals for free DLC items. Better players might become jaded with them or shun the micro transactions

• If u pan on dodge rolling. Make it a habit and master it: 

In DS3 you do not flinch when hit by lighter attacks while rolling

• Make weapons that compliment the alt fire and vice versa: 

I believe this was implied in DS2 by Visceral with the new Force Gun alt fire. A good example is using the Ripper to give the Contact Bean safer charging time while it floats in front of you. Be smart and creative. 

• Lastly

Since the nerfing of stasis and weapons like the Line Gun have come it is almost imperative that you have a weapon that shoots fast rounds. For clarity I mean a gun that has bullets that travel quickly through the air and shoot immediately after pulling the trigger. This rules out guns like the Ripper alt fire, making slow shooting guns easily dodgeable. Do not let the telemetry spike fool you. They are slow!

And that's it! Feel free to give advice in the comments.",self,t5_2r5qf,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadSpace/comments/1be07v/combat_tips_for_ds3_players/

I'm on Chapter 7 so far. I'm really digging the customization but many of the weapons

- Force gun: With rivet shotguns and military shotguns being early options

- Carbine: One of the first weapons you can put on your heavy frame by dismantling your pistol. Unfortunately its semi-auto so it just feels like a weaker version of the plasma cutter with a larger clip.

- Plasma Cutter: Like in the previous 2 games this gun remains an all-around winner. The planet cracker or ""wider line"" tips seem to be the best

- Rivet gun: Another weak semi-auto option that's outclassed by the plasma cutter.

- Shotgun (military): For those claustrophobic rooms/corridors 

- Line Gun: Still a great choice

- Revolver: Trying this one now but it really feels like another planet cracker plasma cutter but without the wide shots. That's not a bad thing but why not use another plasma cutter? 

There are still some options available to me now that I still haven't tried (Line gun tips that make it shoot bolas or chain lightning, arc welder) but I hope others might offer their insights on these. It's also only about 30% through the game so I'm sure there are still tons of weapons that will come later for people to discuss.

My parting thoughts are that you should always keep 1 tungsten torque bar on you at all times (once you start getting tungsten) and that the ""stasis coating"" attachment REALLY IS as good as it sounds.

1361805732.0,1970vz,My thoughts on the scare factor of the Dead Space games POSSIBLE SPOILERS INSIDE,,36,12,16,"I think we can all agree that Dead Space 3 was the least scary of the games. I have been thinking for awhile why this is ture (in opinion). I finally came to this conclusion.

**Dead Space**

Dead Space 1 is about an Engineer trying to find his lady friend. Everything goes horribly wrong and as the player you are shitting yourself. Why? The answer is because you have no idea what is going around you. As the player you know **NOTHING** about the events happeneing around you. By the end of the game you still don't know shit other than a giant red rock created by man makes people into killing machines and it's scary. Then you think you die.

**Dead Space 2**

You wake up in an unfmaliar place and have to run for your life. At the very start of the game you are dumped into having no idea what is going on

**Dead Space 3**

The whole point of the 3rd game was to conclude on any question and that is the exact reason as to why it is less scary. From the beggening we know what Necromorphs are; we know what the Marker does to people. We know about the different types of Markers and where the Red ones come from. The only questions left is how to stop them. **The whole game is based around understand something we did not understand in the first two games.** 


**My point TL;DR**

Dead Space and Dead Space 2 were scarier than Dead Space 3 becauce in the first two games we were playing with things we didn't understand. Dead Space 3 was about understanding everything and once we knew all the details it wasn't as scary because we knew. **We fear what we don't understand.**

I am totally over thinking this because it is a video game but JAVA class is a joke.

1) My fake dead girlfriend

3) Hitler. Was he crazy or not? Was the Marker fucking with him too?

4) Kendra. I couldn't really understand what she was saying in the end other than about Nicole. What did she want with the Marker? 

5) Was the Marker destroyed when the asteroid hit the planet? 

That's about it. Some answers would be much appreciated.

These are good games and I am enjoying them

- Model a planet cracker in its entirety - every door opens, make the ship ""realistic"";

- Create a crew manifest

- Each crew member has a simple AI: if they are in a room with a necro - freeze in place, flee. If they see a necro kill/infect someone - flee. If fleeing, and they encounter a crew member who is not, pass on the ability to flee;

- At the start of the game, infect it and create a slasher. If it cannot smell a corpse, move towards crew and infect it. If it can smell the player, avoid it;

- Slasher AI: If it can smell the player

""Smell"" allows necros to detect other actors a couple of rooms away.

Necros cannot open doors, ""smell"", and then move in the direction smell compels them (which may or may not involve vent travel)

Necros do not drop loot

Once the infection starts

Issac starts in the prospecting room - this is a space off the main ore processing space where the ship's geologists can examine samples of the rock currently being worked. The geologists use plasma cutters to blast chunks off the sample for analysis

The plasma cutter does not have ammo; instead, but the cart must be plugged in to an electrical power source (allowing the cutter to move through the ship)

All other weapons are similarily improvised - a medical cutter may be used to create a weapon

There is a weapons locker on board

That's the rough outline. Not the same game at all - but a good one,False,self,t5_2r5qf,1355167477.0,,,t3_14lybr

Although I haven't played any DS game in the past few weeks I keep dreaming about it. My dream either is all about DS or half way through any random dream necromorphs break in and shit gets awesome =D

But this night

A storyline for DS4. The character you're playing is Ellie. After the final battle and Isaac dying Ellie goes into hyperspace. 

Prologue: Ellie heads towards planet earth

This is when shit got real in my dream. Lets fast forward a year or 2.

EarthGov has been experimenting on how to reverse the changes in DNA that turns humans into necromorphs, and so on. Imagine the DS2 beginning. Isaac is being interrogated/experimented upon on how to build markers. That’s the kind of surrounding you’re playing in. All close quarters, necromorphs be comin’ from errywere!

EarthGov has captured several specimen of necromorphs from the moon and have taken them to a facility where EarthGov uses a mixture of their DNA and that of non-infected humans to create some kind of hybrid being on which to perform DNA-experiments. The Necro-humans. Necro-humans come in multiple forms of mental state and physical appearance. There are violent loners. Those that will fuck up anyone or anything in their path. There are stable,2 and 3 for the casual killing. 

You/Ellie

Things turn bad when the (standard)necromorphs from the moon break out of their chambers and start messing around. Eventually releasing also the Necro-humans. These will scatter around the facility. 

Lets imagine DS3 Ellie, or you become less necromorph, more human. 

Like choosing between the path of good and evil. Do you become more necromorph and does the marker signal gets a stronger hold on you giving you telepathic orders on how to escape the facility and let your fellow necromorphs turn planet earth into a necromorph breeding ground / marker home world. Or… Do you become more human with EarthGov helping you escape the facility and going out destroying the necromorphs and the moon marker?

When choosing the path of the necromorph, wall climbing and/or vent crawling. You would be up against EarthGov soldiers and Necro-humans that sympathize with EarthGov or those who are working against you in general.

When choosing the path of the human, just like in DS3. Under no circumstances should these be effective or strong. No ista-killing anything. You run for as fast as you can as long as you can using maybe the EarthGov sympathizing Necro-humans to aid you or weapons/tools given to you by them or EarthGov.

As a necromorph. After clearing the facility of EarthGov and EarthGov sympathizers you get to a point where you help in finishing a marker that was under construction deep within the facility. This will spread glorious convergence all over earth. Resulting in a true marker home world from where on the marker signal can be spread.

As a human after clearing the facility of necromorphs you never learn about the earth based marker that was under construction. Instead you join the forces of EarthGov as you turn your attention to destroying the moon marker. This will make for some DS2 styled combat. As you were moving through the sprawl on Titan going from building through building. You are now going through moon housing structures.  Then you get to the marker base which after an epic boss battle will be destroyed killing off all the moon necromorphs. 

However. Surviving Necro-humans in the facility will find out about the earth based marker and try to complete its construction. Making them ‘whole’ again. This will allow for a DS5 to be made.

Please let me know what you think of this. Tips are welcome too. I might be able to expand it.",self,t5_2r5qf,1366270391.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadSpace/comments/1cgaey/i_had_a_dream/

                  [+3 Damage +3 Clip]

Bottom Circuits: [+3 Reload](To max out reload speed)

Fiddled around with my Plasma Cutter until I came upon this build.  Best gun I have made yet.  I used the MK-V Explosion Amplifier for the extra ammo and to complement my second gun (that I don't even use).  Feel free to substitute any MK-V attachment.  

This gun is an absolute beast and cuts through limbs like a hot knife through butter.  The Flame Glaze mod makes the analogy even more appropriate.  Ran through impossible with just this gun.  Big enemies (for no spoilers) at the end are made into shooting targets for this gun.  Shoot at one of their arms and they will flinch.  The high rate of fire renders them practically immobile.  Everything with two legs; do the classic legs+crotch shot for immediate amputation.  Dark version of enemies takes two shots to amputate. 

Any suggestions on how to improve this gun?  I'm sure this gun has been made before

* Constantly topping off a magazine on a weapon (shooting one bullet and reloading) wastes a clip per reload.
* Reloading a gun from empty uses up 4 clips. If you reload both the upper and lower guns from empty
* If you want an ammo efficient weapon

Some of my favorite combinations that are light on ammo:

**Rivet Gun/SMG** - Compact Frame + Telemetry Spike (Upper) + Military Engine

* The rivets do absurd amounts of damage for the huge clip size

**Flaming Shotgun/Suspended Ripper** - Heavy Frame + Miltary Engine-Conic Dispersal (Upper) + Rip Core + Flame Glaze

* Shotguns have a pretty huge mag for a heavy weapon and do great damage at decent ranges

**Carbine/Force Gun** - Heavy Frame + Military Engine + Plasma Core

Each of the supporting survivors, and through the course of the game I felt my attitudes towards them changing.

For example: [At first, and also provided much needed humanity.](/spoiler)

[The scene where she has a slight break down after Norton is killed tugged at my heartstrings. After all, but I also think that her death was a major contribution to Issac's character development. To wrap up my talk about Santos, I have to say that she will be missed.](/spoiler)

My Next example is also fairly obvious. [Lots of games have characters that you love to hate, I'm talking about Norton. I'll be honest, I kind of liked Norton to begin with, but after it became apparent that Issac's relationship with Norton would be soured over his relationship with Ellie, I decided to like him less. And less. And even less. Until I hated that god damn self righteous cunt for leaving Issac locked in the damn cage after just tromping through the intestines of a gigantic necromorph. Seriously, who the FUCK does that shit?](/spoiler)

But alas, which is surprising because I never really sensed that Ellie cared as much about Norton as he did about her. Until Issac kills him of course, that's a whole different ballgame.](/spoiler)

All in all

That's just my opinion however. I was going to do a more in depth analyses on people like the other old guy member of Ellie's team, but it's 3 am here, so all I can say about him is this.

I for one just finished it and is currently playing it again on Pure Survival. I think the dlc is brilliant because it gave the game a second run to show people that Visceral is still capable of making something really scary. 


I REALLY enjoyed Carver in this dlc, and to the point. 


The new monsters and the redesigned ""Pack"" was great as well. Those ""mother-in-law"" brute/stalkers were a good threat. The pack looks awesome now

I wish however that the cult leader was a bigger threat. Like that he would've followed you around from the moment you stepped onto the Terra Nova. Like hearing his whispers and voices throughout. And I wish they would've made something unexpected with the trams. Like that it would explode or be attacked by regenerators and you have to stasis the threat until you arrive. Just something more unexpected there. 

Overall a good dlc

1363193419.0,1a82h5,Awakened DLC Review - Discussion / How bad did it scare you?,danthaman15,18,5,26,"Before you read this post

Review:

Dead Space Awakened gave me nightmares. I'm seriously not kidding. After finishing it

It wasn't Necros being dismembered in my dreams

Being hailed as a return to the horror we were all hoping for in DS3

I'm proud to say they delivered on all fronts. Awakened is seriously the darkest and most disturbing of *any* of the Dead Space content I've played. Those who have only played the third game or are more in tune with the ""action horror"" feel of the last 2 games will likely be caught of guard by the sudden onslaught of disturbing content.

I won't spoil any plot here, it would have felt like fanservice, but the shift in tone has actual plot significance.

What took me off guard here was the *ferocity* of the horror. There isn't any sugarcoating for a broad audience here. The entire DLC is a relentless attack on the senses. Gone is the ""taking charge"" attitude of the second and third game, and the game never rewards you after a firefight with a cutscene or ""break room"". This gives Awakened a fever pitch of intensity that I seriously did not expect, considering the toned down ""action movie"" nature of Dead Space 3. But most, and best of all, the general *feel* of the first game is recreated here. The sense of mystery, of ""WTF is going on?!?"", the mounting dread of opening the next door or turning the next corner, ect. This is the Dead Space 3 the fans wanted.

So how is everything else? Thankfully, the environments are rehashed from Dead Space 3, but redone to keep things interesting). Part of why the horror works so well is the plot taking a simplistic and backseat role, reentering the scene when necessary. Once again, this is a great way of recreating the feel of the first game. The lack of a true driving force for the characters besides survival helps keep you in the moment for the horror. 

Are there any negatives? Alas, but this has been a general problem with DLC from the beginning of DLC itself, so I'm not holding it against Awakened. However, there is a feel that the devs had not run out of ideas before the ending, so some extended playtime certainly seemed possible. The opening Tau Volantis chapter is a tad weak, and one of the new enemies turns out to merely be an admittedly creepy looking new skin for the Stalker enemy, one that you only actually face in 1-2 firefights. Tau Volantis just isn't very scary, where the horror decides to hit full blast. 

Ultimately, so I recommend taking your time, but you're in for a treat.

**TL;DR** Awakened is a herald back to the horror of the last 2 games

What did you think of Awakened? Did it scare you? Was it worth your time?

- That it's an EA/Visceral Games production.

- The ""flashbacks"" are done in the same style as in Downfall but obviously different artists.

-------------

Here's a few questions I'd like to see the answers to: 

- Do Rate of Fire circuits decrease the time needed to charge a shot for weapons like the Contact Beam, or do they just decrease the refire time between firing and being able to start charging the next shot?

- Do Reload circuits on lower tools have any effect on reload times? I've heard that the reload time is dependent on the upper tool

- Do Clip circuits just increase the number of rounds in a magazine, by default, holds 4 (3+3+3+1) clips worth. Does adding Clip circuits just increase the capacity of the weapon, or is it possible to make a clip contain 4 or 5 shots worth for the Plasma Cutter?

- Do different engines or tips have different, the effect of a Clip upgrade tends to be small; is that different even between weapons with the same base clip size, or is the increase based entirely on the original clip size? I suspect that it is just based on the original variable, without regard for the specific part or weapon type, but I'm not certain.

So basically at the end of Dead Space 3, but what I am saying is that tricking someone only works once. 

So Isaac and Carver live!, but why? Why keep a character around after setting the ground level of his impending doom? It's one of the most cliche things ever made in the history of story telling. The idea of the hero escaping an impossible scenario. Now when you have this as a plot point, and can predict it well and let's be honest here, almost every story has one or more of these moments in it, making it very cliche and played out. I'm saying it strips ALL the tension away from the story, takes something about life and death and makes it about immortality.

Don't get me wrong, and debris is flying everywhere around him at high speeds. Now unless Isaac has some sort of amazing ability to kinisis himself to safety, he'd still have a concussion.

I'm sure some of you have heard of a show called 'Heroes'. Well, but doesn't. Noah Bennet, a Heroes character has around 4 times where he has literally said his death speech and is seconds away from passing away, yet help comes. Now the first time this happens, I was thinking, ""Oh damn, that sucks man"". The second time, ""w/e

Now i'm not saying, no doubt in my mind about it happening, I knew from that moment anything could happen. I didn't have this pre notion of he's going to live. The writers never gave any clues of what would actually happen. Mainly cause the series didn't need him, sure it's nice to have him as a character but he isn't necessary.

Now another example, you have limitations. At any point, you might die. You know this and yet the series gives you hope that you know damn well wont amount to anything, what kind of future would it have? Shit, i'm slightly off topic. The walking dead says ""fuck you"" to immortal characters. Tension is constant and you never know what will happen for the most part anyway, let's not get to carried away.

Presentation: Depending on how you use the element of surviving impending doom matters a great deal, but he lived. Was this a useless scene? No it wasn't, it added to his character, it changed the flow of how the story progressed. Something happens in that scene, he saw what he thought to be god and it changed his life. While movies like 'The Avengers'(great movie) for example, have Iron man seem to die.. but this can't be, he has to live. Now is this the same as 'Pulp Fiction'? No, that's not how it works. This kind of movie is different, it's chaos. No super hero's exist in Dead Space's world. 

There's one other way of tricking the audience in killing a character and this one bugs me to hell. Actually killing the character and having some deus ex machina child's tear bring him back to life. Granted it depends on the story type. Something like pokemon? Excusable, especially in a story that's trying to be semi realistic in it's ideals. If you watch or read any Dead Space lore, you'll understand when I say, Dead space tries to create it's own world based on physics and logic. Well for the most part anyway, the markers are kind of a deus ex machina at times. Now stuff like Dragon ball Z bringing people back to life isn't as big of a deal cause the story usually isn't that great, you want the fighting. So you tend not to care about one area over another. A simple trade off based on the creators playing to their strengths instead of trying to be a jack of all trades.

In conclusion to this fuck heap of a thought, cause I damn well was. The effect of Isaac living vs dying is tricky, if he lives it's instant gratification while if he died it's a much deeper sense of gratification. He gave his life to give humanity another chance and perished. It would feel horrible at first, then slowly(at least me) you would start to see a much bigger gratification, something that can't be done when the end has no casualties. Casualties meaning, not just people, but anything. 

Ah jeez, if i'm missing a point, or if i'm dumb for thinking the way I do. Either way, thanks for your time.

I'll try to describe the part I am stuck at: I've already traveled over that flying pad thing that makes you shoot through the air like a rocket (navigating through rocks and stuff). The part I am stuck on is shortly after that. I go down the path, and about 5 or 6 regular black necromorphs spawn (they crawl out over some fences, one by one).

I assumed the tentacle would stop blocking the path after I killed all the necromorphs, until they stop spawning... but nothing happens. The wall of destruction just catches up with me and kills me.

Do I have to kill the tentacle too? I tried shooting it's yellow weak spot but it doesn't seem to do anything.

I'm hoping everyone here is enjoying the sub and is pumped to slice and dice in the new game. There will be a few new changes implimented to help keep the spam/over posts as well as repeat questions being filtered out.

A few changes that will be detailed in the next few weeks:


---

*Weekly Let's Play/Video Blog Roll Posts - Instead of the flux of everyone wanting to post their scary/funny/diarrhealicious overtaking the sub we'll allow a weekly post for you to put your Let's Play video along with a description of what makes it unique or why we should watch.

---

*New Text Flair - I think adding text flair would help people find friends here on the sub for co-op. Just add your system (PS3 - nicolauz/ 360 - nicolauz/ PC ect) along with your Gamertag or username).

---
*Weapon Crafting Posts -  Much like the Let's Play. It's great to share weapon ideas and crafting techniques. We'll start a weekly- bi-weekly weapon crafting posts.

---
*FAQ/Sidebar - I'd love some help crafting out a bigger description/sidebar. Suggestions appreciated.

---
I'll also be adding some new image flair's from the DS3 achievement list next week.

Any other idea's or concerns are greatly encouraged as a great community is only as good as it's community involvement !  I look forward to the next following weeks. Thanks again.
