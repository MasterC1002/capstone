For the next ~20 minutes, various people in the glff channel of Riddermark showed up outside the south gate of Bree to attempt to beat this pig to death. We were unsuccessful. The pig even managed to kill a level 85 player through some wizardry (his death can be seen in the chat window in one of the images posted below). At approximately 1:20 A.M. EST, April 21st 2013, the decision was made to take the pig into Bree. As the pig entered Bree, it became vulnerable, and was subsequently killed by a level 41 player. This was met with much dismay.

------------------------------------------

&gt; **Celestrata:**
&gt;
&gt; **Hey everyone
&gt;
&gt; **So it looks like that at this point that we are definitively not coming back up this evening. The teams still need more time to complete their work. However
&gt;
&gt; **Again

------------------------------------------

&gt;&gt; Mekerek : So I am just curious ... Any details as to what's really being done behind the scenes for Turbine/WB?  (Yes I am more technical so like to hear details about the back end activity)

&gt; Celestrata: We actually have mentioned this a few times in various threads
&gt;
&gt; The work that we have been performing is a very large-scale upgrade to our back-end systems, and that's why this has taken so long.

---------------------------------------

&gt;&gt; BrittanyM:North American players would appreciate to know if they should just start turning in for the night or hang in there because we can get our dailies etc and some Friday night gaming in...

&gt; Celestrata: We did actually state earlier that it appears that the service will not be available tonight

---------------------------------------

&gt;&gt;  bootcher: I'm also pretty sure there are several salary employees (not all)

&gt; Celestrata: To be completely honest with you
&gt;
&gt; The teams involved are working extremely hard in getting everything back up for you guys. If you want a visible example
&gt;
&gt; And, but it most certainly looks like progress is being made.

---------------------------------------

&gt;&gt; Zottkanf:hmmm odd...not a rant
 I work in the industry and the 'back end' systems are there for this exact reason. They are BACK END systems. Meaning they shouldn't have anything to do directly with your game servers

&gt; Celestrata: Unfortunately, we've mentioned that one of the systems that is going through this upgrade is the billing system. When you log in, the game asks the billing system what type of account you are, have you paid your subscription, etc. These are pieces of information the game itself needs to know so it knows what to give you and how to treat your account.

----------------------------------------

&gt;&gt; Dirgeros:  I pray that all of our toons are all intact when you bring the servers back online in the future. Sooooo much time &amp; energy went into building them. Do we have anything to worry about in this regard

&gt; Celestrata: You need not worry for your character's safety. As I stated, and has not been changed.

---------------------------------------

*(non official but informative)*
&gt;&gt; Lashmore: From what I've read on twitter and dev posts and what I understand about processes from my own IT work experience before I moved to more labour based work is that Turbine had a list of jobs for this maintenance period each with an order to be done in and an estimated allocated time.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; At one point one of their processes came up with the error that caused the extension as they couldn't move onto the next process until this one was completed and thus one process took much longer than estimated to fix/get going right before they could move onto the next.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So I believe they are past that now from the feeling I get from recent posts and are moving through the remaining processes.

Turbines Character Naming Policy for Lord of the Rings Online (LOTRO) (http://support.turbine.com/ics/support/KBAnswer.asp?questionID=37&amp;) states, is that people with well researched

The immediate result of this is that the character in question is accused of a Naming Policy violation (which, even if I have never heard of a case like this actually resulting in a ban) and the “offending” player character gets renamed with a generic fantasy name from the random name generator. Results can be as nice, fitting and lore-appropriate as “Lakgorbor” as name for a hobbit. If you picture that name should belong to an orc-chief…  well, Turbine disagrees. This renaming to a randomly generated name happens without talking to the player at all – even if the player is online, on that very character, in the moment of renaming.

Obviously these events are more likely to hit players with Tolkien styled names rather than the various “IgankOrcs” running around. And it’s those players who are well invested in their names, Turbine does not even offer affected players a free character rename to an appropriate name. Instead customers who effectively have their names “stolen” by Turbine are referred to the LotRO store, where they can buy a rename for 995 Turbine points (close to 10 dollar/euro)

So effectively

This, it should not go un-commented

Flash forward to when LoTRO became f2p and I was one of the first ones in line. I loved the game. The visuals

 I continued to play as an f2p player just grinding out token points to unlock places like Moria (took a several months). I never got a subscription because I'm a bit short on money and all my money goes to tuition, etc. (life of a college student trying to save up) haha. 

Anyway some months back, said [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/lotro/comments/rlv03/any_way_to_earn_free_turbine_points_i_cant_afford/c470osf). And BAM! Two month VIP Account! And those two months were some of the coolest times I've had playing LoTRO fully. So I would just like to dedicate this post to ThomasTyndan, an awesome man in remembrance of giving me two of the most awesome months I've had playing LoTRO. Thank you ver much!


**tldr; Sir ThomasTyndan is awesome!**

1367582072.0,1dm47j,Alert on Skirmish purchases,Wifrin,32,2,2,"Hello there everyone.

So, only individual ones are on sale, the packs are not. With that in mind, lets look at some math.

The normal price for the skirmishes stands at 195 each. There are 8 to buy, on sale, you are looking at 8 for 156, or 1248, for a savings of 312.

Now some of you might be saying ""I don't have 1248 TP sitting around. What should I do?"" Well, and Icy Crevasse), which would cost 585 (Reg) or 468 (Sale) meaning the sale only actually saves you 7 points off the pack. There is also the defend pack, for 625 which includes 4 skirms (Stand at Amon Sul, Defense of Prancing Pony, Ford of Bruinen and Survival: Barrow Downs) which would cost 780 (Reg) or 624 (sale) meaning right now you are saving only 1tp off that pack.

So the sale prices don't matter as much as long as you plan to get the packs. The only one not included is Storm on Methedras. So if you are short on TP, and get the others as packs later, for an overall cost of 625+475+156= 1256

TL:DR
If you are short on turbine points, as you don't save many TP buying them all individually.",,False,self,t5_2rfus,False,,

___________________________________________
*Let's start with why I think this game could be overwhelmingly successful very soon.*

**1) Helm's Deep:** This is probably the most iconic name in Middle-earth. With the recent announcement, Dar Narbugud, and Ost Dunhoth (Rift/DN/OD), it will be the most successful expansion the game has had since release.

**2) End-game solo content:** Hytbold. Watching a pile of rubble slowly grow into a sprawling community was a genius way of satiating those of us who lack the specs (or interest) for end-game raiding. Major props for creating a ""soloable"" end game that was worthwhile. I know this was created to divert interest from the delayed instance cluster

**3) Upcoming Revamps:** I'm crossing my fingers here. The housing revamp will ideally bring some life into the currently stagnant and dead neighborhoods. Rumors of ""skill trees"" will naturally bring up mixed responses
___________________________________________
*The following is why I think this game could be dead within 2-3 years (or extremely unpopulated).*

**1) End-game loot:** This is the biggest change that Turbine needs to consider for the upcoming expansion, end-game thrived on trying to accomplish your Tier 2 Challenge deeds, which were the only significant way to acquire quality gear. Today's end-game community strives to exploit the game (School exploit, FLM T2 exploit).

I see many comments from players

A simple solution: Bring back the ""lock"" system implemented in OD, and DN. Remove seals from 3/6 mans, or at least make the amount from older runs (Tham Mirdain, Annuminas, Great Barrow) insignificant and unrewarding to farm. Give people a REASON to do newer instances.

**2) The Ettenmoors and PvMP:** I don't consider myself an expert here by any means, PvE, lag issues, unbalanced, too easy to rank, no new zone, etc.)

**3) End-game raiding content:** It is nonexistent. We were given an 85 version of Filikul (commonly known as the ""Turtle"") in Battle For Erebor. We were given an easily exploitable Flight to the Lonely Mountain which was removed for nearly a month. We were given The Fires of Smaug, albeit primarily for nostalgia purposes. Then they butchered OD into multiple instances, and scaled the difficulty down to where the instance is now unrecognizable. Combined with the new loot system, Hytbold is the only aspect of end-game content where Turbine has not ruined the game and caused numerous raiding kinships on my server to disband and move on to different games.

**4) Helm's Deep:** If it continues the trend of the Riders of Rohan expansion and end-game
___________________________________________
I will end by saying that I have poured more money than I can count into this game, because I don't want to bother exploiting and/or grinding the same repetitive instances over and over. Can't wait for Helm's Deep, crossing my fingers that it is the best expansion yet!

___________________________________________
**TL;DR** - The Riders of Rohan expansion has ruined the game. The upcoming Helm's Deep expansion will either revitalize it to it's greatest state since release,False,self,t5_2rfus,False,,,t3_1d1ixe

Slayer Deeds:

**Brigand Slayer (and advanced)**

Narrowcleave - around 34.7S

**Goblin Slayer (and advanced)** 

Either: 

* Forested Area - around 25.0S
* Fort - 25.0S

Both areas are located across from one another

**Harvest Fly Slayer (and advanced)** 

The Vale Height - around 33

This is a very small area, and then exited by the opposite side of The Vale Height, killed the rest of the Harvest Flies, and then ran to the Inn in Stock, after exiting the Inn, I found that the Harvest Flies respawned. This is a good technique for a person who likes to keep moving and hates waiting, if you're fine with waiting, rinse

**Slug Slayer (and advanced)**

Rushock Bog - 29.3S

Very boring deed. Just keep running in circles and listen to some music. 

**Spider Slayer (and advanced)** 

The Quarry - around 27.9S

**Wolf Slayer (and advanced)**

Either:

* Dora Brownlock's Farm (and just North of it is the lair) - 31.3S
* Bridgefield Wall/Puddifoot's Fields - 30.5S

This is what you will need to maximize your monster kill XP:

1. Go to your barter wallet and click the ""perks"" button. Then buy the rested XP boost. 

2. Go to the store and buy the 100% XP from monster kills for 1h (150 Tp).

3. Go to Wyrthing near Snowbourne.

4. Have several of your kinmates mount up on their war steeds and go on follow on one of them. Preferably a tank of some sort who can pull mobs.

5. Have the ""driver"" start running through the fields near Snowbourne picking up all the mobs he can while the rest of you DPS the targets.

Normally this will give you 3, every 4 or 5 mobs you kill equals to 1 quest turn in. And with good DPS you are killing 4 to 5 mobs with in 10-15 seconds. With the 100% Xp right now for monster kills I leveled from 80-85 in 2 hours.

And a bonus is having lootbox drops. This last run we had about 8 keys drop and 6 boxes.

1307603661.0,hvc1i,r/lotro It's time we had a chat about The Unwritten Rules of Fellowing...,himejirocks,21,1,24,"There are tons of these posts on the forums and I am pretty sure I am beating a dead repost by talking about this but if there is even a slim chance to help someone out... I'll take it.

**The Unwritten Rules of Fellowing**
     please feel free to add on to the list

**1. Every fellow has a leader

 You may be a tank, but as funny as the youtube video is, nobody likes a Leroy. Your leader has a lot to do making sure each member is up to speed on the next fight (info giving, quest checking, food eating). Let him give the go before you **go**. 

**2. Everyone is a noob the first time. ASK if you don't know.**

 It is wayyy better to take a little time in the beginning to ask what you are suppose to do than mess up and wipe the fellow. Alot of quests have an 'easy n quick' way to get though them. And those ways often change during the updates.  I have never seen hard feelings about someone asking questions.

**3. Be Prepared.**

 Silly thing to have to say, you have enough to give a few to the toon who forgot...pay it forward... To tell the truth, you should have a full stack of each linked to your quickslot bar even for soloing...

**4. Know your role!**

Everyone has a role to play and good fellows become great fellows when each do what they are suppose to

I know hunter and mini the best so let me give you 2 examples.

 A good hunter uses his awesome dps to beat down the target quickly. 

 A great hunter keeps an eye on the fellow for poison, damage areas, etc)

A good mini heals.

A great mini is traited to buff the fellow without needing to attack a mob and keeps the buffs up as much as possible. He times his skills so that the fellow have an in combat morale increase as often and long as possible. He never runs low on power using planning and smart healing. He channels all attacks through the tank (option menu) so as not the take aggro

**5. Understand assist windows**

So the leader placed an assist window on the tank. (common practice)
Don't attack until you see the health start to go down (or you see that that toon is the one the tank plans on killing first). The tank may be cycling through toons to get aggro. You start attacking everything he does you might pull aggro of him making his job harder...

**6. Wait before you attack.**

Let the tank get the aggro. I know this scares the shit out of minis because just by running into a mob can take off half of the tanks health but wait. You pop a heal too soon and half of them are gonna run straight for you.  Just remember

**7. Although this should be number 1. TURN ON YOUR VOICE!!!**

 So you dont have a mic
 And for gods sake

**8. Don't chat speak while in raid.**

 I am so bad at breaking this rule. While you are in a raid and you have tons of people only the most needed conversation should be voiced. When a leader asks a question,""I do!"". There is little chance that the leader saw the flickering red symbol by your name flash.

**9. Don't loot until the mobs are dead.**

 Anyone loots during a fight and I am rolling on everything
 Depending on the style (and size for laptop users) the person's screen loot can hide wardens gambits and LMs. Wait until everything is dead.

**10. Don't loot until everyone is up. (Rezed)**

 Same thing with the retreat countdown. It can hide the loot list and you don't know what you are rolling on.

**11. Learn how to do FMs and listen when they are being set up.**

 There are posts online about how to do these and I have posted about it before. A well timed FM can keep your fellow alive and cause nashing of teeth if you are the cause of the fail... Stuns and bad timing can't be helped but missing it because you were drinking Mountain Dew...not good!!!...unless...well I guess if you brought enough to share for all....

**12. Not all skills should be used in a fellow...no matter how uber cool they are. Unless you are really really sure it is safe to do so.**

 I remember using Rain of Thorns in the Grand Stairs instance and the arrows dropped down to aggro all the mobs hundreds of feet under where we were standing..oops.. 

 Another time I was on mini auto mode (you know push 1, eat chip, push 3) when I was brought back down to earth by my whole fellow yelling at me. My cool double phantom sword attack (mini skill) was messing up something they were trying to set up...oops..

 You have pets running off to aggro mobs and AOE attacks killing the wrong mob (and ruining hard modes)

**13. Ok this one is just a minor pet peeve but...PLEASE thank your fellow when you finish.**

 I have only have had this happen in PUGs but...great run

So you getting aggro from family and have to drop quickly. Fine, GG!"" before you go.

 It is best to be polite to people with big swords and bears as pets...just sayin...
(jesting aside people remember problems and being polite might get you that next invite you really really want...)



So here is my list for now...add your own and I will put them in the list. And see ya on the other side!!!

Note:

To accomplish all the deeds in Sarnur you have to explore the entire area

This is the first of these guides. I am in the process of completing every deed in every region in LOTRO

I know that there are a ton of websites out there that provides information such as this. Most of them, you don't have to kill as many of the creatures for the Slayer Deeds and the areas you can find these creatures usually are small, making it go by that much quicker. Be in mind that in future posts of future regions I will take the deeds that I found to be difficult (long, boring) and tell you how I went about it to make it go by a little quicker. 

Thanks for viewing and I hope this helps.

I was highly recommended by numerous people *not* to put LOTRO on an SSD, because ""MMOs don't benefit from this technology"". 

I just wanted to throw it out there and confirm that the new drive *is indeed amazingly fast*, for instance) is nearly instantaneous, probably less than a full second. There's also no stuttering in freshly loaded, highly populated towns.

I have tried out LotRO before when they had 10 day trials but couldn't really get into it and so I downloaded it a few days ago again now that it's F2P and I spent a few hours last night just completely geeking out in the Shire once I finished the intro quests (which I started an Elf and enjoyed the intro quests for them regarding Skorgrim and Dwalin etc..)

I must have spent a good 20-30 minutes in Bag-end just geeking out picturing where some of the events of the Hobbit and LoTR took place inside the hobbit hole. I am a huge Tolkien fan and have read all of his work except the Children of Hurin.

So far with the game I'm a level 8 Guardian Elf and I've done a few quests and I understand that the freebie's are limited but for the first time in my short MMO life I feel no need to grind as fast as I can to reach max level. Once I reached the Shire I spent a good amount of my time just exploring the different parts and recalling certain events from the books. I still don't understand a lot of how to play but I'm sure I will find my way.

How do you join?  Look to the right, you can't join a kin until after you do that!).

Why us?  Why not?  Sure, come talk to us on Ventrilo, get free crafted armor and weapons, free advice on how to improve your game, and get that warm good feeling of passing it on and paying it forward to the next lower level guy that joins.

First, you will knock out rep very quickly that way.


However


First


Using that, and maybe Duo):

The first  Torech Naur you come across you fight normally nothing you can do with that one, other might need to time their attacks just right. I did it with my guard, so an improved sweeping cut was enough. This bleed effect will actually kill the  Torech Naur before the second wave of trash mobs arrive. Once it drops you can runn tot he next area leaving the Trash mobs behind, and they will not aggro UNLESS your Skirmish soldier gets their attention. So its a good idea to know how you Soldier Stands in relation to you and orient them away form the enemy's direction.


At the 3rd Torech Naur you do the same thing, possibly from both sides, however they will end up passibg you my if you hide in that corner and they end up on the platform. Once the Torech Naur vleeds out the remaining 2 times and drops, the door will open and you can just sneak in without gaining trash mob aggro, again same notes for the Soldier apply.


Finish the Instance as normal wash rinse repeat. The good news is that doing this per run at level will get you pretty much enough Marks and Medallions to purchase more rep tomes from the skirm vendors

These days

I'm not really looking for the typical MMO experience. If I reinvested into LotRO it would be to enjoy the story line

Would you folks recommend LotRO for this or would it be a waste of money to only play casually and mostly by myself?

1311254285.0,ivsjl,Class Hints,Natefil,16,5,35,"I've played LOTRO since the beta (more heavily after the moria expansion) and thought I would offer a few key points of advice I've found helpful for various classes. I have a lvl 65 Captain

Here's some advice on a few of the classes that you may find helpful:

**Burglar:** 


1. Addle after a flashing blades will remove the remainder of the attack animation while instantly applying the damage. Basically

2. 5 deep in Quiet Knife is all you need for 90% of the grouped content. Pair QK with traited counter defense and you have yourself a consistent crit chain. Also note, practice it thoroughly before grouping, timing is everything. Remember that you can let a regular gamble almost drop off before hitting Gambler's Strike and popping it to max tier and resetting the gamble's timer. 

3. Burglar armor is really up to your liking. I go with moria over the helegrod because of the stats.

**Captain:** 

1. GET 4 PIECES OF THE HELEGROD GEAR! It is extremely important. You don't need more than four

2. That brings me to my second point. The most important legacy on an emblem is Rallying Cry Cooldown. Without the legacy the emblem is worthless. The order of importance for legacies goes: Rallying Cry CD

3. For a weapon, and Pressing Attack Targets. 

4. Switching shield brothers will separate a great captain from a good captain. Put shield brother on the tank, an early switch can cost you the buff or the emblem bonus), remove shield brother from your tank, apply shield brother to your main dps (if single target: rk or hunter, if aoe: champ), apply to arms, keep it on your dps target and wait to reapply To Arms the second time then switch shield brothers back to your tank and repeat.

5. If you like going into the moors: Do Not Trait Oathbreakers. It is not that useful and when I'm on my warleader I'll just bubble the target I see that on. Shield of the Dunedain with the legacy for the cool down is awesome. Get it

**Minstrel**

1. This is going to be from an observational standpoint as this is the class that I've spent the least time on. First

2. Underused Skills: *Call to Greatness:* The benefit from this is unmeasurable when applied to a captain during a particularly difficult phase of combat. If you have the 5 piece bonus for the healing oriented OD gear then everyone get's their individual Call to Greatness buff and your fellowship's effectiveness will be dramatically improved. *Song of Aid:* Before a fight starts or during a rough phase put this out. The champs who are in ardour will be able to activate ardent flurry (-20% attack duration) and captains will be able to get off a Rallying Cry if the group needs heals or a War Cry if the group needs dps. *Ballad of War:* GET THIS LEGACY! +20% damage for melees is monstrous. I can't overstate the impact that makes. 

3. Traits: I get frustrated when minstrels trait Enduring Morale when healing. It only provides 260 morale and there are much better legacies to use. I recommend trying out a 4 yellow

4. Minstrels in DPS: You are effective and can blow things up very quickly but trust me

5. Healing in the moors is very different from healing in PvE. Utilize your low to no induction skills in the moors, flopping and fleeing to the champs. 

**Rune Keeper**

1. Essence of Winter is one of the most underused skills from a damage standpoint. On a regular hit it does 3 times as much as your ceaseless or scribes spark and hits three targets. On a crit it matches the damage for those skills with their critical multipliers.

2. Annuminas gear is not worth it. Don't feel bound to an armor set for a bonus

3. Fire damage is useless

4. RKs are great healers but it's about predictive healing. The tank will get the first bit of aggro so stack up a few mending verses on him but then expect the champ (if there is one) to pull aggro for a short period of time

**Wardens**

1. The Warden is a tough class to master. Personally, threat leaches and self heals. 

2. My two favorite legacies are War Cry Threat and Exultation of Battle Threat. It has been argued that the increase is small but I'll take a small amount of threat gained over none at all.

3. Wardens gain threat as the fight goes on

4. Gearwise there isn't much that is pivotal for Wardens. The Helegrod gear is fairly nice for spars while the OD (Javelin) gear is great for tanking. A well crafted warden can sit at about 8k health unbuffed if they have the right legacies. 

5. Currently

6. Don't underestimate the value of your virtues. Innocence, Tolerance, Fidelity, Honour. The Mitigations provided by those are invaluable for many end game runs.

Here is the thing. I was founder of a level 10 kin on my other server. I sort of fell away from playing (you know we all take breaks from time to time) and others were running it. I would log in MAYBE once a month for a few hours but just couldn't get back into the game... 

 I think the problem was it was your normal pick up kin. Anyone welcome. Lots of people who because it was a pick up kin didn't give a fuck about each other... no feeling of community

 So then I came here

 Truthfully I joined at the worst time. In America (I am American but I live in Japan) you were all just getting busy with real life. College students were cramming for finals. Holiday season. A shit load of new games had just dropped (Portal 2

 I saw people that I assume were regulars one by one stop coming.. truthfully it was kind of sad... I don't know, or something happened that stopped you from coming, or you got tired of having to PUG to get anything done. 

 ANYWHEW the reason I am posting this is to shout out to all those people who drifted away at that time.. I DARE YOU TO LOG ON! You will freak!!

 I don't know all the reasons but...DAAAAAMMMNNN! **The kin is a busy busy place now!** We are getting 2 to 3 new members a day. The runs are awesome. And can you believe this?!? Yesterday I was watching the kinlist

 In one day I got 2 major pieces for Midoringo (6man fellow), and had to drop just because I was so tired I could not keep up. **IT'S LIKE FEAST AFTER FAMINE!!!**

So I guess what I want to say is ALL OF YOU WHO DRIFTED AWAY!!! Pop back in and see us again!

**TL;DR The kin is busy busy busy!!! AND I AM LOVIN' IT!!!**

**Casual:**
&gt;Tank:

&gt;* Always initiate the battles.
&gt;* Know your way around the instance.
&gt;* Be aware of your surroundings. (ex: patrols
&gt;
&gt;DPS:

&gt;* Never initiate
&gt;* Attack what the tank attacks
&gt;
&gt;Healers:

&gt;* Heal the tank before DPS (if the tank dies

**Hardcore:**
&gt;Tank:

&gt;* Constantly rotate targets landing at least 1 hit on each target
&gt;* AoE as much as possible
&gt;* Make sure to constantly check health bars
&gt;* Face mob away from the raid
&gt;* If you notice a mob is CC’d near you
&gt;* Don’t stand in shit on the ground
&gt;
&gt;DPS:

&gt;* Know your enemy mobs
&gt;* Use Crowd Control (CC) on mobs that are farthest away
&gt;* Don’t attack CC’d mobs!!!!
&gt;* Don’t stand in shit on the ground
&gt;
&gt;Healers:

&gt;* Keep an eye on debuffs and remove feared effects
&gt;* Always have HoT’s on DPS that are taking indirect damage (mob AoE)
&gt;* Be healing efficient. If your heal heals for 400 and your target is only missing 200 life
&gt;* If your heals are HoT
&gt;* Communicate that you are going to heal a specific party member so that they can conserve potions and other ""o shit spells"" (paraphrased from pri1mu5)

Thanks for the very helpful tips.

So to summarize so far (please correct me if I'm wrong):

* It is possible to do only a subset of the *Books* from *Volume* I
* Some books provide useful rewards and access to further content (cf. AlucardZero's answer).
* The *Books* do not have to be completed in order
* However each *Book* individually ([Book 1 Quests](http://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Category:Book_1_Quests) example) is a series of quests that need to be completed in order.

Some things I am not clear yet:

* If a quest fails (some of them are buggy), the epic quest just disappeared altogether from my journal.

I made a number of changes based on all of your fantastic feedback and had a much more fulfilling experience tonight. It also helped that we were with a really solid tank who knew exactly what was happening.*  

***Thank you all for your excellent suggestions

-----

* How do you get through the rough times in LOTRO? 
* What can you do as a bad player to gain worthwhile experience?
* What can you do with a bad group to avoid failure?

Some context for this follows
  

I had a terrible evening in LOTRO today. Using the instance finder, and I felt that it went poorly, despite it ultimately being a success.  
    
    
The first group contained a Warden, we eventually gave up.   
    
    
For the second run we had a Champion, and then wiped. We switched our strategy slightly and tried again as we agreed that it felt possible. Unfortunately, we couldn't hold it together and we wiped a second time. We eventually disbanded after ""nice try""s were passed around and the champ suggested that we get a real tank (in a helpful sort of way).  


I was then left, but my confidence was so knocked that I didn't think I could pull it off.  


With the first group, I felt entirely at fault. Although we didn't have a ""real"" tank, the champ was very experienced. I just couldn't keep him healed throughout the final fight. On both tries with this group, during Dargnakh's third rage, we would wipe.   


After the second group disbanded


I perhaps shouldn't feel responsible for the failures


I pug very rarely on my Minstrel and feel that, which is hurting my confidence, and to make matters worse, my play time is limited.  


I love my Minstrel, the community in particular is what keeps me playing. However, being left with this feeling of failure is not enjoyable and it's not something I can continue to subject myself to.  


I would imagine that any responses will be along the lines of ""forget it, but I'm really looking for advice on how to move past the feeling of failure when things go poorly. Is it ever possible to coordinate a messy group after multiple wipes?  


**tl;dr How can I get good healing and leadership experience as a Minstrel without failing all the time?**

 You can bring out your SS by right clicking the UI or your Skimish horn in your quick slots. You can dismiss just as any pet by clicking the SS and choose dismiss.

I'm looking into LOTRO as a way of exploring Middle Earth (visually

1. I don't have any friends playing it so I'll most likely be solo-ing (I'm in the Southeast Asian timezone). Will a better class for this be a Burglar or a Champion?
2. I'll be using a friend's old account that has Lifetime subscription. What's the best way for me to to take advantage of this?

Each server has its very own economy that is determined by the players who play there. The supply and demand of each type of item can vary greatly depending on the playerbase's needs and accessibility.

To make myself more clear, according to my hypothesis, will mean that key items are cheaper as they are more accessible. A server that has more lower (non level 75) level players may have a higher average cost for key items.

Let us compare our servers' prices in terms of selling values on the Auction House

* Cracked Rhi Helvarch Sigil - ~8g
* Worn Symbol of Celebrimbor - ~20g
* Level 75 2nd Age LI - ~40-45g
* Draigoch's Scale - ~200-400g
* Worn Symbol of the Elder King - ~600g
* Level 70-75 Steel-bound Lootbox - ~60g
* Star-lit Crystal - ~50g

I believe these will be enough to gauge the differences (if there are any) between the different servers. Now I understand that the economy on any given server can change at any given moment for whatever reason. Currently

As a player in MMOs, tank, or heal during an encounter rather than just burn things to the ground.

However

Here are my main contenders for a good class for me

1) Rune-Keeper - allows for my DPS and solo power

2) Minstrel - Solid group character

3) Lore Master - solid choice imo...DPS-ish character who has CC, but I'm open to hearing details.

4) Guardian - I like the durable types

5) hunter - I hear this guy is boring more than anything else...which worries me. Some say however that it's a great class that doesn't have many toys during combat

6) Burglar - Solid debuff class...I normally don't like melee DPS

7) Captain - Seems like it could be interesting

8) Champion - again

Is there any reason why this game runs so bad on Windows 7?  I have a relatively new system with all updates installed.  I've gotten several crashes already.  The last of which required a hard reboot (could not access the task manager).

Is it possible to track 2 things at once

Is there a shortcut to sell things directly from your bag, all my junk is together, all my supplies are in another bag, etc.

Are there 4 starter areas

Are racial bonuses really important for class function?  For example is a hobbit burglar better than a human one?  Or are the racial stuff just small bonuses?

re: Shire Housing Organization - Step Two
by Kiralynn of Rohan on 2012/07/13 1:11
Greetings! 

 It is time to organize a new kin neighborhood! What is a kin neighborhood

 There are currently four official LMB neighborhoods - Imrath Ivrin in Falathlorn, and Hliflak in Thorin's Hall. Although a number of LMB members live elsewhere, those are public/informal neighborhoods. 

 You can move into this new neighborhood whether you are buying new house or relocating from another neighborhood. We ask that if you are moving out of an official kin neighborhood (Imrath Ivrin, so that another LMB member can buy it, keeping the neighborhood kin-only. 

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

 Here is a general outline of how we go about founding another kin neighborhood: 

 1) We find out which housing area the most people want to move into. This time we'll be establishing a new home in the Shire. (Next time

 2) We post a list of available addresses. Everyone replies to the post requesting the address (or addresses) they would like to purchase. 

 3) If two people want the same address

 4) When all of the deluxe and most of the standard houses are spoken for, we schedule a move-in day. We warn everyone that this is an estimated date, and to watch the forums closely in case we announce an early move-in. 

 5) People who are moving out of other neighborhoods to join the kin neighborhood sell their existing property to get ready for the move. 

 6) Hopefully, somebody else causes the new neighborhoods to be created, so we make an emergency announcement for an immediate move-in. 

 7) Everyone buys the house they signed up for on the master list. We ask everyone to give Harperella and Lennidhren maintenance permissions on the house

 8) Everyone who buys a house updates their Address Book entry here in the forums. 

 9) Decoration Donation week begins. Banders visit the new neighborhood

 10) We hold a Neighborhood Party to welcome everyone to the newly decorated area. This usually includes music, fireworks, and free ale and pipeweed for everyone! 

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

 To sign up, and third choice of address(es). I will put an asterisk (*) next to a home that has someone asking for it as a first-choice, and a plus (+) next to a home that someone has requested as a second/third choice. You can still request any address that you like.",,False,self,t5_2rfus,,http://www.reddit.com/r/lotro/comments/xbmsq/homestead_neighborhoods_suck_all_the_good_houses/

I want to make a reference list for the Kinship. I'm looking for two things:

1. Association of mains/alts to a single person. This will obviously help players associate in-game characters to a single person. It can be confusing when players

2. What everyone brings to the table. The crafting system is setup to encourage interdependence of Kinship members to progress. It would be good to have, and the skill level of each.

I enjoy Brandywine the most so far as there seems to be a decent balance between low-level and high level players. I also enjoy my toons most on this server and find myself striving to remain active in the Lotro community. I love the festivals, talking with random people, helping others, giving out random mats, etc.), and I love crafting. I've got an itch for grinding, I suppose.

I also love every class, Elf/Hunter/Explorer, Man/Cappy/Metalsmith, Dwarf/Champ/Armsman, Elf/LM/Scholar, Elf/RK/Tinkerer, and a Dwarf/Guard/Yeoman

* I genuinely enjoy hunter - it's the first class I ever played and killing things is generally fun.

* Cappy is awesome

* I love my Guard right now and basically just use OP the whole time - I feel about as powerful as a champ.

* RK is awesome and maybe the best class in the game in my mind

* I enjoy the challenge that LM gives me and want to see what one can really do late game.

* My Warden is the class I've progressed through the game with the most though pretty much exclusively with a friend who's a minstrel. While everyone talks about how difficult Warden is, so I don't just throw anything at an enemy. I'm not getting rid of him anytime soon.

* Champ is fun

* *I'm pretty sure I have a minstrel somewhere on these three servers and I remember the class being awesome. Perfect blend of ranged dps, and an option for medium armour. Cool quirks and extra skills on the side (like teaching others how to play instruments). Plus bagpipes.*

I hope that gives you an idea of my mindset for this game and how I feel about the classes in this game. In terms of crafting, be it arms, armour, or jewels.

The reason why I'm considering a Guardian is that I've never really tanked in an MMO before and would really like to give it a serious shot. Tanks are always needed

1360260962.0,182s8n,LOTRO Performance Issues ,sctalkingtime,12,4,26,"I've got an i5-3550 @ 3.3ghz 
8 GB DDR3 RAM
GEForce 560 Multiview video card
1GB Barricuda 7200RPM drive
80mbs/30mbs connection 
I run the game at high settings in 1920x1080 resolution and have tried tweaking things around in terms of shadows/draw distances/etc although I never touched the troubleshooting settings. I get mostly similar performance out of the game whether I'm maxing absolutely everything or have everything on medium-high settings. 

Here are my issues:

#1 - My high level toon in particular takes a long time to load into the game. It's not extremely long normally but long enough that I want to go tab out and do something while I'm waiting.
#2 - I occasionally get video stuttering issues
#3 - Rohan stutters on a fairly regular basis while mounted 

So I understand my system isn't exactly cutting edge but it's not too shabby either. I feel like I should be able to run this game maxed out. I can max out most other games that I've tried without any noticeable performance issues. Here

So - with all of that said - I am considering upgrading my system and I'm wondering if anybody here can give me some idea as to what would fix my issues above or if they are all server-related on Turbine's end. After doing a bit of research I've found that upgrading to an SSD would be the best bang for my buck but if it's not going to fix any of my issues
