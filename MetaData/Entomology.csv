1326766765.0,ok7ds,Would anyone be interested in a University of Reddit course on entomology/insect identification?,Funkentelechy,82,11,28,"
Hey r/entomology



Recently I did an [AMA](http://redd.it/n54v9) over on [/r/askscience](/r/askscience) and several people asked me how they could get better at identifying insects in and around the home. One person in particular suggested I start a short class over on /r/UniversityofReddit to teach the basics of not only insect identification, each one focusing on a different order of insect. At the end of each presentation, there would be a short sight ID ""quiz"" where we could go over the process of identifying the specimens we talked about. If there's enough people, I'd be willing to throw in a prize near the end for the highest scores!

I think it would be a great opportunity to get the community involved and try to make a positive impact (...and maybe lessen the number of ""IS THIS A BEDBUG?!?"" posts we get...)
The resources provided by /r/UniversityofReddit are quite substantial and would provide us with not only Mumble/Vent servers to for discussion


So what do you think? If you're interested or have any suggestions,False,self,t5_2qygr,True,,,t3_ok7ds

She moved into our backyard... really just onto the back wall of our little rental townhouse... nearly a month ago

It's been getting really cold outside, on her back, on the window sill where she fell... but I interfered.  I took her inside, put her in a large transparent tupperware container with a wad of wet paper towel, put my ""incubator"" in the sun shining through the sliding door and steamed her back to life.

My mother-in-law offered a small aquarium, along with another wet wad of paper towel (I know I need to get a spray bottle), and a chunk of wood for...I don't know...climbing?...whittling if she gets bored?  I utterly failed to find any insects to feed her around the property, so I offered her a chunk of banana, which she LUNGED at, scaring the shit out of me.  Seems she's been restored to full vitality.  Yesterday night after a little reading I went to the pet store and bought some medium-sized crickets, dropped a couple into the enclosure

At this point

A little more googling revealed that ""vomiting white foam from her ass"" is just mantidese for the beautiful miracle of childbirth.  SO now there's an egg wad in there too

* I know this egg thing is supposed to survive the winter and hatch in the spring.  So what happens when there's no winter stage?  When is this thing going to hatch?

* Do they lay eggs even if they're not fertilized?  I ask because I've never seen a second mantis in the yard

* Am I feeding her okay?  The crickets are cheap

* What should I do?

* JESUS MANTIS BABIES WHAT SHOULD I DO!?",self,t5_2qygr,1352422460.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entomology/comments/12vvmr/rescued_a_praying_mantis_now_i_think_i_might_be/

2. According to the [Encyclopedia of Entomology](http://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&amp;pg=PA2054&amp;lpg=PA2054&amp;dq=Stenopelmatidae+weissman+CAS&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VWCjMwfMUS&amp;sig=LM7-A_YdYYfQFyCHflHQF_dfo7A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iADgT9fZEais2gWNp8CoCg&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Stenopelmatidae%20weissman%20CAS&amp;f=false)

3. According to [Species File Software](http://orthoptera.speciesfile.org/Common/basic/Taxa.aspx?TaxonNameID=64245), namely, *Stenopelmatus*, *Ammopelmatus*, *Viscainopelmatus*, and *Stenopelmatopterus*.  For IDing purposes, if the stenopelmatid was found north of Mexico, you can rule out *Ammopelmatus*.

4. It's probably best not to attempt a species ID with *Stenopelmatus*.  There are currently only 17 described species in North America

5. This just in: Somebody just submitted what may be the Internet's first ever photo of *Ammopelmatus* [here](http://bugguide.net/node/view/712551/bgpage)!

6. Does anyone know if [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/29845002@N02/3083881249) is a photo of *Viscainopelmatus davewerneri*?

7. Where can I find a photo of *Stenopelmatopterus*?

8. Where can I find a photo of *Macrelcana ungeri*?

9. Does anyone know how the heck does [one species live only in Eurasia](http://orthoptera.speciesfile.org/Common/editTaxon/Distribution/ShowDistribution.aspx?TaxonNameID=64245) while all other species live in North America?  That seems so random.

10. Look at [this madness](http://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&amp;pg=PA2060&amp;lpg=PA2060&amp;dq=Stenopelmatidae+weissman+CAS&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VWCjMwfMUS&amp;sig=LM7-A_YdYYfQFyCHflHQF_dfo7A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iADgT9fZEais2gWNp8CoCg&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Stenopelmatidae%20weissman%20CAS&amp;f=false)!  Females at least some of the time engage in sexual cannibalism!

11. Stenopelmatids can draw blood with their huge, so opportunistic invertebrate carnivores may confuse you for ""edible matter.""  This happens rarely though, but adventive invertebrate biting does indeed occur, and have been a topic of scientific studies and papers (nothing conclusive yet though).

Yesterday I was driving through Indiana to pick up some things from my apartment in West Lafayette. Some time after I got there I needed to defecate, still alive.

i was hoping i could get a bit of an insight into the working lives of entomologists.  at the moment im working as an accountant but am thinking of going back to university to study a zoology major with a focus on entomology.

1. what jobs do most graduates end up working in?
2. what is the salary like compared to the national average (here in australia its about 70
3. what do you do on a day to day basis? how is it different from what the common perception is of your work?
4. what qualities or 'type' of person would be well suited to a career in entomology?
5. what other fields can an entomologist work in?
6. can you recommend anything to help me gain a better insight?   i've tried applying to volunteer at the queensland museum, competitive and i didnt get short listed.

1338716725.0,uifxd,My review of ThailandUnique.com's edible insects,Joseph_P_Brenner,24,4,2,"**Note that all of these insects were dried.  I suspect that they would taste much differently if they were fresh.**

* [**Bamboo worm pupae**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-bamboo-worms) - Instead of getting a bag of just bamboo worm pupae, there were some bamboo worm pupae.  Also, they were actually the larvae, not the pupae.  How did they taste?  Great!  And even though they were dried, they still had some moisture in them.  Really hard to describe the taste, but they were genuinely good.  I can see why they are popular in Thailand.  I've had wax worms before as well, and they were really good as well.  Bamboo worms and wax worms are actually caterpillars

* [**Big crickets**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-crickets) - When they said these crickets were big, but it was really mild.  I think I was tasting the seasoning, which was really good, far more than actual cricket.  **Rating: 3 labial palps out of 5 labial palps since there wasn't much taste**

* [**Chinese yellow scorpions (*Hottentotta*)**](http://www.thailandunique.com/chinese-yellow-scorpion?filter_name=scorpions#.T8sha8Uv678) - Unlike the other bugs that resided loosely in the silver plastic bags, I only got 3 scorpions, and they were tiny.  However, they had big taste!  I would describe them as nutty and smoky.  Also, I chickened out and remove the stinger before popping in my mouth, ha!  According to the website, these are available for wholesale.  Mmmm

* [**Giant water scorpions**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-giant-waterbugs) - Personally, they are very closely related since they are in the same superfamily, not to mention they look and behave very similarly, so I assumed the taste of nepids would be similar to belostomatids.  Well, when I opened the bag (like a kid on Christmas), I did not get multiple bugs (despite the pluralized ""scorpion"" on the bag and website description), but rather only one.  HOWEVER, I got one HUGE, rostrum, this thing was really fearsome looking and I would be lying if I said I did not place even just a front leg into my mouth with some degree of trepidation.  As I chewed the front leg

* [**Grasshoppers**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-grasshoppers) - Just like my review of ""big crickets"" but with a little more taste

* [**Mole crickets**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-mole-crickets) - I have never seen a mole cricket in my life

* **[*Phyllophaga rugosa* beetles](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-macrodorcus-peudaxis-beetles)** - Unlike the other bugs in my order, the overall experience was like eating cardboard!  **Rating: 0 labial palps out of 5 labial palps**

* [**Pregnant field crickets**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-pregnant-field-crickets) - Not sure if these were actually pregnant

* [**Queen weaver ants**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-queen-weaver-ants) - I think I tasted more of the seasoning than ant, these were very palatable, even if I was tasting mostly seasoning.  Overall taste and experience was like [furikake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furikake), and like furikake, I'd bet these would also be awesome with rice.  I'd like to try these fresh next time.  **Rating: 4 labial palps out of 5 labial palps**

* [**Sago worm larvae**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-sago-worm-larvae) - WTF?  I got a bag of grasshoppers, and squash bugs.  No sago worms!  And why do they call them ""sago worm larvae?""  That's like saying ""human baby infant"" or ""dog mammal.""  ಠ_ಠ

* [**Silkworm pupae**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-silkworm-pupae) - Interestingly

* [**Squash bugs (*Mictis caja*)**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-squash-bugs) - I don't think what I got was *Mictis caja* but rather a different coreid.  Regardless

* [**Weaver ants (*Oecophylla*)**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/edible-weaver-ants) - My eating experience was exactly like the queen weaver ants except the workers were obviously much smaller.  I've read that these were supposed to be slightly bitter

* [**Bag of assorted edible bugs**](http://www.thailandunique.com/edible-insects-bugs/assorted-edible-bugs) - Why did I get this when I already got all of the above?  Because the website said this would also include dung beetles

---------------------

**UPDATE:** I voiced my complaints to ThailandUnique and they are resending out the sago worms!  They also said they forgot to update the contents of the ""bag of assorted edible bugs"" on their website as the dung beetles were replaced with squash bugs,False,self,t5_2qygr,1338720771.0,,,t3_uifxd

This Bumblebee seems to think my home is a great place to start a nest (x-post from r/bees).,TarantusaurusRex,24,5,30,"This very determined and diligent little bumblebee seems to believe my apartment is the best place to start a new nest. This is what I assume

I went to the park for a few hours. I had left the window open. After I came back

But she wouldn't go away. She just kept flying around outside the window
We figured she had had her way with the place

Nope. Ain't no getting rid of a clingy bumblebee

After around two hours of the incessant buzzing outside my window, off she flew. My boyfriend closed the window, but guess who's back and wants inside?

We're getting a little tired of the little helicopter hovering around outside my apartment. Is there anything we can do to help her or make her go away? I obviously don't want to kill her. She doesn't really seem to mind us at all--she has barely noticed us in spite of how aware we are of her presence.

TL;DR: a bumblebee is desperately trying to move in with me and has been inside or desperately trying to enter my apartment for nearly 6 straight hours. What to do?

In case it matters: I live in Europe.

**UPDATE**:  Miss bumblebee went to bed around 9 p.m. and gave our ears a rest. I figured she would be gone for good. It is now 7 a.m. and she is at it again

My boyfriend will be home all day

**UPDATE 2**:  So, crawling around in the bunch of scarves that she seemed to enjoy yesterday. She's sort of trapped in one of the scarves and we're going to wait a while to see if she frees herself. My boyfriend was afraid she was trapped and moved it, but she buzzed angrily so he let go and ran away. Pictures coming soon. She is definitely a cute, fluffy, yellow and black-striped bumble bee.

**Semi-related story**: At around 5 p.m., and flew away happily into a nearby tree with blossoms. Bumblebees seem to be a recurring theme in my life lately.",,False,self,t5_2qygr,1366217495.0,,

Some of these seem rather farfetched, so I figured I would just ask the experts here on r/entomology what they recommended I do.  For now poor Azathoth is in a bag in my freezer.  I have access to all of the standard insect curating supplies, as well as copious amounts of 70% EtOH and acetone.  I don't particularly want to drop him in a jar of alcohol, though.

First, he seems to spend a lot of time with his face buried in his food. Just sitting there, motionless. Is he asleep? Finally, if I pick him up, interrupting one of his face-stuffing sessions, he ""throws up"" on my hand. He'll secrete one or two big drops of brown liquid from his mouth. If the surface tension of the drop doesn't break against my skin, he sucks it back in after a moment.

I'm assuming it's just chewed up fruit from whatever he was eating. I'm guessing the act of picking him up startles him enough that he spits it out. Or maybe it's a defense mechanism? I'm really at a loss here! Mostly I just want to know if I should be worried about him. He seems perfectly healthy otherwise.

1358882419.0,172kh9,Questions about Entomology &amp; Grad School,pbperson,14,1,2,"Hi everyone. So I graduated in May with two liberal arts degrees, I ended up withdrawing from it. That said

My interest is geared towards public health and I'm considering going to grad school for public health, so I know that if I went the entomology route I'd be able to handle it.

Questions: How's the job market with medical entomology? I'm leaning towards it because it seems like the intersection of public health and entomology

The adviser I spoke with strongly recommended urban entomology as far as job market &amp; salary. Anyone with experience with this? Is there any overlap with public health?
