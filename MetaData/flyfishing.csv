Spent a little time in the yard practicing with a piece of yarn.  Then did two fishing outings which consisted mostly of untangling line

Tonight was my third outing which had me wading the mouth of a salmon spawning stream.  Finally paydirt.  My first fish was a tiny little sculpin or as we call them here in Alaska

Now I'm wondering how much of an ass beating I'm going to get when the Coho salmon reach the streams here in a few weeks.  They're about 3 times the size of Pinks.

So you want to catch carp on the fly rod?

Of course you do

First, the river queen, the sewer trout, the list of names is as long as the history.

Originating in Asia, and horses) in much of the US.  As one of the largest minnows in the world, their diet consists of aquatic insects, larvae, bloodworms and the like.  They rely heavily on scent for feeding, with a very advanced olfactory gland, and their extremely sensitive barbels.  Even a fish build for scent feeding can be an active sight feeder; it is these opportunities that we are interested in.

The common carp is considered one for the smartest fish in the water, and likely spooking other fish in the area.  Trout can be polite about rejecting a fly, bass, tarpon, and redfish will simply ignore you.  The common carp is a spooky creature.

There is a lot of food on the bottom of a water body for carp.  They don't have to travel far for food once they find a location.  They can spend a full day picking off hellgrammites or crawfish in on a single flat. They have it pretty easy in the warm months when food is abundant.  I call it ""grazing for meat"".  This is our best opportunity to trick them.  But how is this approached?

It is important to see how these fish feed on the flats.  They tend to slowly swim along (often tailing, bloodworms, etc. (to be referred to as prey from here out).  When the prey is disturbed, it is quickly sucked into the soft mouth, and pushed back to the teeth to be crushed.

This area of disturbance is pretty small

That is the fish.  Now

You've seen them.  The large carp swimming around, and the temps are even higher.  Find flats in your local lake or river, put on your polarized glasses, your hat, and get out there.  Walk the flats as slowly as possible.  You will find your target.  As the water temperature increases, the activity of their prey increases as well. 

Wait, what should I have with me?  

Water.  Oh, but being underpowered going fishing is sort of my hobby.  There are advantages to my 6wt out there though.  The lighter line helps me not spook the fish, but landing one is a bit of a challenge.  This is a balance you'll have to find on your own.   There are a few requirements out on the flats though. Water (yeah, I had to say it again) a quality leader, a good drag, and backing.   Your new friend, backing.  All that comes before fly selection.

Fly selection is a bit of a religious experience for many.  And many carp fly anglers have developed their own fly for the flats (mine is the Dirty Diane, this is balanced with not splashing too much to spook the fish). As is the ability to track your fly once it is there.  Many bonefish flies work well, crayfish imitations, and a lot of nymphs do well.  As the carp eat anything alive they disturb, matching an exact nymph or larvae isn't usually necessary.

Putting it all together.


Ok, you have your glasses, hat and water ready.

Once you're out there

Sunners: (hangers)  These fish are sitting near the surface

Cruisers: these carp are on the move, just because they are there.  They generally eat a little more than the sunners (which is to say almost not at all).

Happy carp: these are the majority of what is caught.  Hanging out on the bottom (where ther eat) they will eat a properly presented fly.

Tailing carp:  these are actively feeding.  Nose down, as they are expecting prey to be flushed out.  They are also the most likely to move further for your fly.  

Keep your distance.  We've mentioned how spooky they are, however, a little past and crawling it into the zone is better.  The best cast is from 90 degrees from he fish (as it is harder to see you, and harder to line the fish) but take any shot you have.  I tend to crawl the fly across the bottom in very long slow strips (very few pauses).  You'll need to keep your fly in sight, as you will see the take. If  you do everything well enough, the carp will suck your fly up, and likely spit it out almost instantly as it will not taste right.  This is why seeing your fly and the fish are so important.  A strip set is all that is needed.  As soon as he eats

This is where your drag and backing come into use.  The carp has a very soft mouth

Here's our official decision:

**We want /r/flyfishing to be an environment where posting new and interesting content is encouraged.  We also want our content to be something we can all discuss

**To link your blog, and linked in the post, not the title.  We request the poster to summarize their post and encourage discussion with the subreddit community.  The blog must be linked in the post only.**


Original post that brought us to this change:

Us mods here at /r/flyfishing like to keep ourselves in the background and let the community downvote content they don't like.  This keeps the content from being too heavily controlled and moderated

As of late,"" and the flags/complaints from the community are starting to escalate.

One thing this subreddit could use more than anything is a ""getting started"" or ""FAQ"" type resource.  As with any fly fishing discussion board on these interwebs, and if anything, just helping them to ask the right questions.

This is a large project that will take a lot of information on a lot of topics.  Rather than trying to keep track of getting hit from all angles with bits and pieces of information from everyone

My plan is to work out an outline based on my years in getting new people in to the sport.  Once this outline is complete

Does this method work for everyone?  Once a starting point is posted

Looked up the current hatch in the creek I wanted to fish

Youtube videos were awesome at teaching me how to cast

So what do you do? 

Do you cast upstream or down stream?

Do you cast past the fish and just let it drift? How long?

Do you jiggle it around like you would a spinner? 

Do you just drop the fly on top of where you think fish are

Do you reel it back in

Does the color of my fly line effect the fish? Should I use a darker color or lighter?

How long should I stay in one spot? Should I always be moving? 

When I do move should I be walking upstream or down?

Should every cast be in a different spot or just keep hitting the same one?

Thanks for any help. Even without catching a single fish today... Fly casting is so much more fun than spinner casting... Had a blast.",self,t5_2qoeg,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/flyfishing/comments/t4na8/newb_questions_how_do_you_catch_fish_with_a_fly/

1338923865.0,umjfz,Catch and release discussion:  Let's discuss the topic and educate one another,beer_engineer,20,0,38,"A recent picture post sparked a bit of a debate on catch and release.  I figured moving it in to its own topic would prove more beneficial to effectively covering the topic and making it informative.

My personal stance:  Catch and release is a great, especially with wild, naturally reproducing stocks of desirable game fish (whether indigenous or introduced) will greatly benefit from the release of that fish to live, reproduce, and provide angling opportunities down the road.

Catch and release is not always necessary, however.  During my younger days, I bought in to ""release everything you catch"" philosophy.  As I gained more experience, and learned the intricacies of different fisheries, my opinion on this changed drastically.  Whether the fishery is overrun with an invasive species that competes with native stocks, a species blowing up in population out of control, a very healthy stock where sport angling take will not effect the escapement of spawning (the pink salmon runs near me fall in this category), or is just a put and take fishery etc.  There is no blanket statement for when and where C&amp;R is the right thing to do.

The most important thing:  Educate yourself on the species

Edit:  Things you can do to increase the survival rate of fish - 

- For trout:  Don't fish when the water temperatures are high (above 60-65f, and make them more vulnerable to infections.

- If you use a net

- Never put fish

- Never put your fingers in a fish's gill plates.  Many anglers are drawn to this as a handle

- Don't squeeze the fish

- Use barbless whenever possible

- Use properly sized equipment

- If you're going to do a dead fish picture

I haven't fished since I was a little kid

**I have a Reddington, #5 rod/reel outfit.** Other than that, I got about ten random flies and a pair of knee high rubber boots I use for work. Plus, [this](http://www.amazon.com/Washingtons-Central-Cascades-Fishing-Guide/dp/0965211622) book on where to go in the area.

I just want to get out on the water

Mine:  that summer run steelhead (pacific northwest)

This is the opposite of the case, before they move to shallower water in the sunlight.

In low, steelhead will be holding in shallow water, typically just a few feet deep at most, at the heads of runs where the water is broken.  This water will be holding the most oxygen, and is typically the coolest area for them to hold.

Like all things that I get interested in, and then after much cursing and swearing, I begin to actually do some research on what the hell it is I'm trying to attempt. So it goes with fly fishing.

Beautiful weekend, head somewhere close to home and give this fly fishing thing a try. Why, I could hear the trout already sizzling in my frying pan, and smell them as they roasted on my barbecue. By god, I was a fly fisherman and I was going to bring home one of those wily trout. A little research shows that they stocked Sanctuary Pond in Hastings Park and it's a mere 10 blocks from home, here was to be my hunting grounds. Here, I was to prove myself the graceful

Holy sweet spaghetti monster, in long graceful loops, pulling line, I can feel the rhythm as I get the line going, and then, I damn near yank my arm out of the socket as I hook into a tree behind me. WTF!

10 feet off the ground and surrounded by thorns of immeasurable size, moons me with glee knowing that it won't be returning to the water any time soon. Sigh, get in as close as I can, untangle/untie as much as possible and realize that I'm going to have to cut the line. Swearing and a few curse words. Then a few more curse words. Then a Mom and her kid show up so I stop swearing out loud and mutter under my breath, while giggling once in awhile. I think that kind of freaked them out, so they left. Who knew muttering and giggling quietly to yourself would unnerve some people? 

Managed to stand on the fishing dock at just the right angle so that I can cast without getting caught on the trees behind me, immediately hit myself in the back of the head with the fly, it embeds itself, but thankfully not deeply. So one fly that took it's earliest opportunity to escape my grasp and one that has just drawn blood, it's on fly box, oh, it's on.

I manfully struggled with my line

This is when I decided to do a little more research, casting some more. Still have a long way to go, but eventually I'll bring home a fish!",,False,self,t5_2qoeg,,http://www.reddit.com/r/flyfishing/comments/1jtzoe/misadventures_on_the_learning_curve/

I am in no way affiliated with Clutch, but I think it's seriously shitty when Yellowstone takes time to slam a company, a new American made company, like they have here.  The reason is simply because they don't carry them.  They've done the same thing to Allen, Albright, and now Clutch.  All of which make great products

As good as that sounds, I'm not saying you can't catch nice fish when you have a camera with you
