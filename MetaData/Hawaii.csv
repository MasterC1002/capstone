He stopped contacting his entire family despite the fact that there was no fight

He unfriended us all on facebook, claiming he wrote them. He's made several rambling posts about how the goverment was watching him, he's claimed to invent everyday objects, and pretty much stopped making sense of any kind. 

We tracked down his former landlord. After he stopped talking to us he asked her if she had any rentals available

He's was living in Honolulu and traveling back and forth to Iceland before all this happened.  I think he went to Iceland after we last spoke, and stays in hostels.  I haven't seen him post anything on the internet since about last April.

I'm afraid he's become homeless and is living rough on the island. Why else would his phone be turned off and have no access to the internet? In his last posted pic

To top it all off

If I had any money I'd fly out there and post flyers and drive around until I saw him. I've been there a couple times before and I know it's not a big place.

His name is Shane Flaten and he's 32 years old. He's 5'7, he camps or finds room to rent on other parts of the island. He particularly likes making friends with international travellers, so if you're visiting Oahu, keep an eye out for him please!

Any information, Hawaii.

Here's a pic of him:

I can safely assume he tried this in order to get a better shot for her camera as I've personally witnessed people climbing the exact same spot before to get group pictures. **Once again

This one takes the cake though.

The hiking community is [catching some bad press](http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/22665419/man-dies-while-hiking-mariners-ridge-trail) and hopefully it doesn't result in stricter trespassing laws, fines, closing of trails etc. from some sort of knee-jerk legislation passed to remedy the outbreak of incidents lately.

There are a bunch of great hiking groups/clubs throughout the state that will gladly take you in and show you the ropes. If you are new to hiking or visiting or know someone who is I strongly urge you to consider joining some of these guys versus reading a hiking blog and doing it yourself.

I opted out of the naked scanners and so had to be patted down. Parker picked up my things from the X-Ray, but she would not acknowledge anything I said. Fortunately nothing broke, but not through any effort of Parker's.

Things got worse from there. She gave me a brief spiel about the pat-down, which was not something she'd warned me about in the spiel. 

This was unlike any other TSA patdown I've received. Normally the agents are professional and polite, I said ""HEY!"" and turned around, and asked her to please warn me before she touched any sensitive areas.

She flatly refused. She just said ""I'm not required to do that, and she said she'd already given me the warnings at the beginning, and that was all she was required to do. I said I'd never had a patdown like that, and she said ""We don't change our procedures for anyone."" She also called me a liar when I said that every other TSA patdown I've had included a narration. 

Because I was uncomfortable with her rough pat-down, and they wouldn't answer my questions about what was happening. After they pushed me out of the exit, they told me that I'd made the ""choice"" to not submit to the search, and that I wouldn't be allowed back through security. (They did not tell me this directly; they just told each other ""Make sure she doesn't come in again."") This was a lie: At no point did I say I was refusing the search. I was only asking for warnings during the search. This is an incredibly small and reasonable request, and the TSA's response was ridiculous and outsized. 

Stso. Parker abused her authority by kicking me out as soon as I made a very small protest. She was clearly retaliating against me because I'd complained about the rough treatment. She should not be in a position of authority

Eventually, but he did say that I would be able to go through security if I was willing to undergo a search. I said I wouldn't go through the scanner, but the metal detector was fine. Mr. Cain told me that the scanners weren't millimeter wave, which is a lie: Honolulu Airport uses the L-3 millimeter wave scanners. He also told me that I would go through the metal detector, which also turned out to be a lie. He escorted me to the front of the line, and then disappeared completely. I was confused, and the other agent waved me towards the scanner. I said no, so I wasn't asking for anything special)

When I came to the search area, and she was perfectly professional. She was gentle and she narrated things as she did them, so the pat-down went smoothly. Cain watched, although it was clearly not for my comfort, but to make sure that I didn't cause any more ""trouble"" for his agents. 

This kind of thing should not be normal. What happened to me was a minor violation on the scale of atrocities that the TSA has commited

TL;DR: Stso. Parker of the Honolulu TSA is abusive and will kick you out at the smallest provocation. If you are unlucky enough to encounter her,False,,t5_2qi3u,False,,,t3_17aoz3

There are other UI changes currently being tested that that will show up in the next few days. Currently we're testing

* A red downvote honu to easily distinguish between upvotes and downvotes

* Various other small tweaks 

Furthermore

Finally

Edit: typo

**Edit: Cayou came up with a great idea of implementing some generic Hawaiian user flair icons. Things such as honus, etc. I'm a terrible artist, but if there are any artists out there that want to create some generic icons, I can set them up as flair.**

* Seeing the islands of Hawaii madeover into a manufactured tourist spot

* I noticed that Hawaiian dancers in the past (when the dances were done for spiritual purposes) were primarily men

* Do you think it is unfair that there is a certain percentage of native Hawaiian blood necessary to qualify for government benefits (like going to school for free or having rights to land)?

My name is Oskar Garcia and I'm the news editor for Hawaii for The Associated Press. I'm a frequent visitor to r/Hawaii (and sometimes contributor)

As my colleagues and I cover these races and report on winners and losers, why?) Who are you voting for for president, U.S. Senate, U.S. House and other races, and what are the important issues that are helping you make your decisions?

We're not looking for any group consensus or anything like that

To be clear, and you're welcome to look me up online or call our Honolulu AP bureau if you have any questions (for ease, the number is 808-536-5510), or PM me here, ask me on this thread or email me at ogarcia@ap.org. I'm also @oskargarcia on Twitter, if you prefer that. 

Above all

-- Is there any one issue or race that most motivated you to vote this cycle? (ie. the presidential race

-- Who did you vote for for U.S. Senate: U.S. Rep. Mazie Hirono, the Republican? Why?

-- Who did you vote for in the U.S. House races? (Hanabusa/Djou

-- Who did you vote for for president? If you voted for Obama

-- Which of the local races did you pay attention to most? Honolulu mayor? Hawaii County mayor? What was most important to you about these races? 

-- Did you have any trouble at all actually voting? There were problems on the Big Island during the primary

Thanks again! Throughout election night, hopefully this turns into a robust and insightful discussion focused on what matters to you in Hawaii! 

**EDIT:** Wow! Just want to say I'm stoked to see the response this has gotten so far and I look forward to seeing it keep up as the ballots close and the results start coming in. First thing in the AM

The judge definitely had his BS-detector on, pretty reasonable in hearing out any mitigating circumstances and took great liberty to reduce fines, unless the violation carried a mandatory fine.

As for me, admitted w/ an explanation, or denied. I denied, and explained what had happened, trying to keep it short and sweet. I had my witness (wife) but he said it wouldn't be necessary to hear from her. He took a few minutes too look at his computer screen, and I guess the police officer entered notes about when I was stopped. The judge said my story lined up w/ what I said at the time I was cited, I didn't realize the officer would enter his own notes that aren't included in the citation. The judge said he believed me, your honor"" and that was that.

My colleague Audrey McAvoy (Reddit newbie /u/audreymcavoy) is writing a story about a long-term decline in tradewinds and what this may mean for life in Hawaii. The starting off point for the article is a study co-authored by UH meteorologist Pao-shin Chu

What we'd like to know from you: Have you noticed fewer tradewind days lately? Are you concerned about this decline? How do you think it affects you or others on the islands? 

We're hoping this discussion can ultimately lead to some of your comments and insight helping our news coverage on this.
To be clear, you're welcome to call our Honolulu AP bureau (808-536-5510), email Audrey at amcavoy@ap.org or myself at ogarcia@ap.org, or PM us here. I'm also @oskargarcia on Twitter, if you prefer that.

I remember a lot of good things

Anyone here old enough to give some perspective on changes (good and/or bad) from the 70s through today?

I know traffic is horrible now. I can street map and see my old neighborhoods and how much more built up they are now. Prices were high back then as they are now. 

Some good things I remember:

* Checkers and Pogo (I won a cheap camera on that show!)
* Kikaida
* The big carpet slide somewhere outside Honolulu
* Going nuts playing hide-and-seek with my sister in the International Market Place (and my parents were fine with that so long as we met them at a predetermined place at the right time - we were younger than 10 when we first started doing this!)
* Farrells Ice Cream Parlor Birthdays!
* Ala Moana Center was still brand-new and completely awesome to play in.
* Managed to swim to Chinaman's Hat (is it still named that in these P.C. times?)
* Regularly went to the Key Hole/Toilet Bowl (whatever that park is called) and just snorkeled to the less-crowded areas
* In fact
* My food horizons, I still like to joke that that I am apparently a hipster for liking sushi et. al. long before it became popular on the mainland.
* The whole ""aunty/uncle"" thing - which applied to nearly all my elders in the neighborhood
* Pidgin was fun - and also got me picked on when we moved back to the mainland.

It was a good time to be a kid then - is that still the case? I'd like to take my wife there and do a extensive revisit.

In a thread I posted earlier

## Please join us in IRC on irc.freenode.net in channel \#rhawaii for live discussion. I will be posting a new thread with more granular details about the project shortly.

As it stands right now

## (EDIT AGAIN: I've set up a +15 dBi omnidirectional (360 degrees of signal

* **Location:** [21.349924,-95.677068&amp;sspn=58.076329,117.685547&amp;t=h&amp;z=17)
* **SSID/network name:** TaosHumAlpha (no password needed)

Right now, but it's there. I have another server and another laptop I will most likely be adding to the mix, as well as another panel antenna. I will also be swapping this connection out for a real wireless router with swappable antennae.

Here are the things I'm proposing and on which I'm asking for feedback:

* Network protocol! I have a Cisco 851 router without the advanced IP services IOS image so I can't use IPv6 yet (unless one of you with Hawaiian Telecom or other Cisco reseller connections can get me a *cheap* Smartnet contract for my router so I can download the newest IOS for it...) but I would **really like to use IPv6 if possible**
* Top-level domains: I propose .odn for **O**ahu **d**ark**n**et (I can host DNS services and I can show others how to do it as well... I also wrote my own DNS server software that will run in Windows with almost zero configuration if anyone is interested...)
* Secure P2P file sharing: Freenet is a package that already exists but I'm also open to suggestions... such as writing one myself using HTTPS...
* Connecting remote sites: Powerline communication for short distances (can be purchased at any Best Buy or Walmart, though. I don't know how the local ISPs calculate that. (Does the traffic have to go outside of their autonomous system? Does it just have to traverse their distribution routers?) I know that Clear has a transit agreement with Time Warner, and Time Warner has an undersea pipe to Palo Alto, but I don't know about Hawaiian Telecom or anyone else. I have Time Warner's business class data so I don't get bandwidth caps... so it's no issue for me to host something like this.

If you've lived on Maui for any length of time, since then has been gaming the system by constantly and consistently ticketing people for the smallest traffic violations and other things in order to get yearly bonuses and such.  Pay he feels he deserves).

Word on the street is his hands were swabbed by TSA at the Kahului airport on Maui, yelling and throwing a tantrum.  I even heard he took statements from other ""witnesses"" in line.  Since he's so infamous, some of the workers present are said to have taken a little satisfaction in seeing his discomfort, and might have been smirking or giggling.  Since then he's been seen circling the airport in the early mornings, trying to ticket those who were involved in the incident.  An incident in which he is said to be at fault, and one in which he received no special treatment nor mistreatment.

I wonder if there's any kind of complaint that can be filed without him calling the entire MPD down upon you for doing so?  As much as most of the island hates him, it would not surprise me at all to see him take drastic measures in order to satisfy his petty sense of justice.

I was apparently pretty crafty as I skillfully used my face to stop the rest of my body from getting hurt. I got a pretty severe concussion and lacerations. 

So to get to the point

A month later she is looking great.  We have two other cats and a dog

But--and this kills me--we just can't keep her.  I hate this.  She is easily my favorite animal in the house

We have taken her to the vet

I cannot give here to the local SPCA.  They have a million cats and it breaks my heart to think she will sit in general population for months waiting for a new familiy.  She deserves better.  I will not take her to the Human Society.

So

If interested please PM me.  We are happy to help pay for the first year of vet bills too.  There should not be many...the vet said she is healthy as a (tiny) moose.

Seems like almost a lose-lose situation.  What do you guys think?  Obviously there are tons of stories that the rest of the world should/need to see and would make amazing films (reign of the monarchy, just to name a few).

I want to meet the people rather than just see the sights. If anyone is up for activities I would love to tag along!
Additional: I already did my research on what to do but if anyone has any suggestions not covered or typically missed I would love to hear them.

Here is the news release from Mike Richardson

------------

**[Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/153sxn/a_plea_to_help_save_climbing_in_hawaii_the_third/) from /r/climbing:**

The island of Oahu has three developed areas for sport and trad: Mokuleia

On June 11th 2012, the area was closed by the state's Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR). 

In August

Now, a difficult bouldering spot west of Mokuleia. It's easy to imagine that bouldering may be outlawed outright. 

This is happening in a state where a person has drowned [roughly every single week.](http://hawaii.gov/health/healthy-lifestyles/injury-prevention/injuryinfo/drowningbrief.pdf)

There are not many climbers in Hawaii so support from the international climbing community would be greatly appreciated. This issue is relevant even if you don't live here. You may want to visit in the future

The Access Fund has agreed to provide

--------------------

If you would like to help

William J. Aila Jr., and that about 30 tourists (and 30 locals) drown each year, but no tourists have ever died climbing.

Here's the Publisher's Weekly Review:
&gt;This well-developed work imagines a Hawaii in the aftermath of an act of home-grown terrorism. Meaning to shed light on their cause, more far-reaching than the bomber had imagined, unfolds through the stories of three characters: Charlie, a mixed race cab driver who is convinced by members of the Warriors of Freedom to be the bomber; Jeff, a self-important real-estate agent whose life falls apart after the murder of his wife, Anna; and Daniel, the heir to the Hawaiian throne. After the bombing Charlie flees to the mountains where he faces the choice of living by his wits or dying. He isn’t around to see tourists staying away in droves, the loss of jobs and rising foreclosures have little impact; he has no interest in living. Daniel, a group with money and political clout. The intertwining of stories is effective, and well worth a reader’s time.

On Monday, a student reported to UH Manoa Campus Security that she believes she was given a drink containing a “date-rape drug” after being approached by two males she did not know.

The reported incident began at Hemenway Hall in Manoa Gardens/Balé about 6:00 p.m. on Friday, awakening in an off-campus apartment with a person she didn’t know.

The student reported symptoms consistent with the ingestion of date-rape drug substances: a rapid onset of intoxication out of proportion to what alcohol has been consumed and reported memory loss.

There is an active investigation into this incident.

To protect yourself, to be with friends and to look out for each other. If you or your friends exhibit symptoms including dizziness and/or nausea, memory loss, and breathing or motion difficulties, get help.  If you are on campus, call Campus Security at 956-6911 or police at 911.

If you have any knowledge of this incident, the Honolulu Police Department at 911 or the UH Mânoa Women’s Center at 956-8059.

archzinno is inviting the lot of us over to his fine establishment for a 4th of July (but not really on the 4th of July) get together. Lets get to the Details!

  * When: Sat

  *  Who: Anyone that is not (!=) a serial killer

  *  Where: 
  *  What to Bring:  
*  Burgers  
*  Maui Onion chips and some gazillion layer dip (Looking at you  [riksin](http://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/i6o7s/reddit_meetup/c21cdvm))
*  Beer
*  Booze
*  Sweet stuff (chocolate
* Computer

I will bring some Pizza! 

archzinno:

Okay so as you can see in the google maps pic, there is enough room for some parking on Moanalua Loop next to the cliff for some cars, so you guys can park there, but parking on Kanuku st on the sides is fine too.
One thing the neighbor asked me when I first moved in was if anyone were to come over through the front of his house for me to escort you in, but I don't like to piss neighbors off.
Anyways
I've got 2 couches and an air matress, because there would be no guarantee you'll get a soft spot.
As for entertainment, and a dart board. At any time 2 of those 3 can be played safely (as in no one getting smacked in the face by a paddle or impaled by a dart.) Upstairs is a little tighter because thats where I spend most of my time, and I've got a 52in TV with every game system. So if you have a favorite party game or something, feel free to bring it. I also have a lanai I will put some chairs out on if anyone feels the need to smoke. Don't think I have an ash tray but solo cups will suffice I imagine.
Any other questions or grievances feel free to ask.
And thanks for picking a creepy pic. I feel like if I wasn't wearing sunglasses I may have had serial killer eyes.

A guy [i could tell he was a local] gets off and starts telling me ""what the fuck"" I said ""SERIOUSLY MAN
""FUCK YOU. SIT THE FUCK BACK IN YOUR FUCKING CAR. NO ONE WANTS TO FUCK YOU, I WILL WHACK YOU RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW""

so im in AWE he was so aggressive. I say ""Really? Really. Okay well heres my phone

Im 5'5 hispanic female. I was in beach gear. Totally didnt deserve the aggression I got. As soon as i said ""Ill record"" he backed up immediately and got in the car with a few last obscenities about my appearance and they shoved their way in front of us in line. 

I was shaking with adrenaline

I got off and snapped a pic of their lic plate, so they waited too. 

The cop showed up and I got off our car to go talk to the officer

The guy denied any threats, and he says ""WHATS THIS? I DONT WANT THIS. I NEED YOUR DL, NOT THIS"". [It was her military ID.] She calmly states he asked for ID, shell retrieve her DL. 

His attitude IMMEDIATELY changed after seeing her military ID and my Texas ID. He spent all of maybe 5 min with me total, while i was SHAKING with frustration and crying. As soon as he got to us, his smile disappeared.

I never felt so unfairly treated and discriminated against. I heard a lot of warnings about staying away from certain ""locals only"" parts of town and not to cross any ""locals"" because they hated mainlanders. But in Haleiwa? Really?

I was gravely disapointed in how it was handled. He wrote it up as a traffic violation [no one was hit and he did nto ticket her for driving incorrectly into a one way]. There is a ""harrassment"" option but he did not file my complaint under ""harassment"". I attempted to dispute this with him but he brished me off saying ""if i wasnt happy to call in 7 days and dispute it or whatever""

I have the entire conversation from police arrival to leaving recorded. [thanks iphone!]

I called a Sgt at Honolulu Police Dept and he said i can only file a complaint with polcie commission

Is there anything else I can do? Is there anything i should keep in mind in the future?

Maybe you'd include historically significant songs by native Hawaiians like ""Aloha 'Oe"" and others written by Queen Liliʻuokalani. Maybe you'd include more modern Hawaiian music

Perhaps you'd even include seemingly random pop songs or unique stuff that just has an anecdotal/personal significance to you and you relationship to the islands? I'm not ashamed to admit that every once in a while the sight of a volcano randomly reminds me of the horribly cheesy theme song to the (arguably awful) 1980s television special ""Garfield in Paradise.""

First off

* Please note that while many of us support the right of everyone to enjoy their lifestyle however they please, and may have already purchased it in anticipation of tomorrow's gathering; I do apologize profusely if this is the case, as we are still getting better at event planning.  We honestly cannot prevent you from making the choice to go ahead and bring it and keep it on the down low, but please realize that we are not held responsible for any fines, tickets, or other legal repercussions for doing so.  The same applies to trees.  TL;DR: If you must, be discreet.

* In note of the above

* A LOT of people have signed up to bring things--our current count is hovering around ~33 +/-3.  As such, utensils (forks/knives/spoons), napkins, and trash bags.  Portable tables would also be appreciated.  Please edit the sign up list accordingly if you will bring these items.

* We also need more folks to bring foodstuffs.  If everyone shows

The denizens /r/Hawaii are here to help!  Many of us live here and are glad to share our Aloha with you

To make it easier to help you

1) Which island are you traveling to?  There are four major islands (Kauai, and 'Hawaii' AKA The Big Island) and two minor ones (Molokai and Lanai) that you can travel to.  Knowing which island(s) you plan to visit allows us to help you right away, rather than asking ""which island are you visiting?""

2) What kind of activities do you like?  Are you a night person?  Day time?  Early morning?  Do you like hiking?  Swimming?  Sipping a drink by the pool?  Knowing what you like helps us to suggest what to do.

3) Who are you traveling with?  If you're by yourself, there are different activities we can recommend for all of you.

My friend found a day old nene goose getting eaten by a dog. He saved it
mother. 

He kept it for two weeks but didn't  really know what to do with it as it would follow him everywhere. So he gave it to me. I raise ducks and chickens and have a big fenced in yard for them. So I raised the nene along with a batch of ducklings. (side bit of cuteness. The ducklings hatched the same day I got the two week old gosling. So
companion. So a line of us would walk through the yard; nene chasing me and the 6 ducklings chasing nene). 

I asked around about what to do with her.  Apparently the humane society works with DOFAW to return them to the wild

My thought was that as long as I didn't keep her contained, she's beginning to fly. Her safe half acre of fenced in lands (orchard with ponds) is surrounded by dogs (my own and neighbors). None of the dogs are particularly dangerous, but she has a bad habit of pecking at their eyes. 

So, she'll probably be killed or kept in small confinement. 

What do I do? Please

TL;DR I have a nene goose and am not sure what to do with her.

I am seriously considering switching to the new HawaiianTel Fiber option -- sales reps came through my neighborhood (last week) after they ran the fiber (last month).    Unfortunately

I also noticed (from their website) that the 50/10 service is really 50/2 and you can upgrade to 5Mbps and 10Mbps Upload at some extra charge (cant find a price).

So my questions are:

1. Does anyone have the service?  If so, Internet?

2. How is the picture quality

3. How are the internet speeds

4. What is the '$5k worth of equipment' they will install in your home 
'free of charge?'

Any details will be of great benefit.  Thanks

**Update #1:**
Called Hawaiiantel, so I'm glad I called.

**Update #2:**
If you get a tv package, will be 1Mbps.  I'll be waiting for the new project that allows higher speeds and TV before I switch the TV packages.

I did an insane amount of hiking while I was there and I'd like to thank you guys for providing the FAQs in the sidebar that lead me to sites like UnrealHawaii.com which is a treasure trove of incredible hikes to go on. I hiked a bit before I went there but while on the island I absolutely fell in love with it and will probably start doing a lot more back on the mainland as well. I'll recommend some hikes that I did. Mariner's Ridge is a wonderful one to do with family or for people not in good shape, it was fairly long and after the beginning part was pretty overgrown and there wasn't another soul on it. It has a pretty cool view of Kaau Crater as well. For a workout you really can't beat Koko Head. 

Another big thanks to you guys for your Places to eat FAQ. I have you guys to thank for checking out Teddy's and South Shore Grill both of which I thought were fantastic.

A captive breeding program and intense predator control has brought the nene back from the brink of extinction. Now you will find them on Big Island, Maui, Molokai, and Kauai.

 * Games:! PC, SNES and more... But we need some common games that we can all play (SC, Quake 3, Halo, WC3, BF:BC2...)

 * Equipment: I have bunches of 16/24 port 100Mb dumb Switches that we can use, but I cant guarantee anything on that front. Servers may be a bit tricky if we need them, but I could pull some stuff together.

Type 1: The Gangster


Even though Type 1 comes from heavily gentrified areas like Kapolei or Mililani, typically, give less than what was paid for. It is this practice that causes people to use him as a “last resort” when all other contacts are unable to provide. 

Type 2: The Raver


Type 2 loves to dance to house music and party it up at small clubs in Chinatown. He doesn't like to smoke herb because he is concerned that the munchies he will eat afterward will cause him to gain weight. Type 2 encourages experimentation into hard drugs; he will share stories of wild nights when he was shaking his booty in nightclubs while high on E. He is very friendly


Type 3: Classic Stoner Guy


Type 3 is cool as fuck. He's got long hair, weed, and AC/DC. Sometimes he's unreliable, but usually he pulls through with some herb that will knock your socks off. Type 3 is always low on funds so he usually asks for gas money and will ask for a bite of whatever you're eating, but it's worth it because he's reliable. 


Type 4: Surfer


Type 4 is from California. He moved to Hawaii from California for the waves. Type 4 and Type 3 would probably get along really well because they have very similar personalities. Type 4 is a hippy: he will talk about mother nature, and he is perma-baked; even when he's not high, he appears to be ostensibly. He has some of the best herb on the island.

Need friends? So do we! Need a ride? Let us know! Got a ride? Let us know that

Maunawili Falls is a popular beginner trail with a nice waterfall and swimming hole at the top. Make sure you bring shoes that you won’t mind getting muddy or wet because this trail will likely be both. A swim suit is highly recommended if you want to take a dip at the waterfall. EVERYONE BRING WATER! 

Parking is going to be an issue at the trail head, Kailua and we’ll carpool. 

Rain or shine

Edit: Looks like we have plenty of drivers... Who's coming from where? I'm more concerned with our leeward folks; I can pick up people windward.

As far as the start time - How does 9 sound? So meet in Kailua around 8:30-8:45. That will put us back at the car around 1pm (depending on how long we screw around at the falls) - then lunch in Kailua?",,t5_2qi3u,1346307794.0,,oahu,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/yztx5/rhawaii_hiking_meetup/

She's planning on volunteering on a few organic farms to get her feet wet and start looking for a solid place for us to live before I get there in April or May. We love North Shore and Honolulu, but we're pretty open to where we want to land on the island. I know if we landed near Kahuku I would go to the Superette every single day for the best poke I've ever tasted ;)

OK so I'm basically cool with living anywhere on the island except a tent city. I'm bringing my own job (internet based) and she has dark skin and almost looks like a local (Kama aina

So, btw), but it seems like Hawaiian Telcom restricts your plan options based on that already.  So, for those of you that have (or have had) wired home internet from one of these companies, is it worth switching from a hotspot setup to save $20/month?

EDIT: Thanks for all of the feedback everybody!  I'm getting a lot of mixed messages on speed, and I'm guessing that a lot of this depends on where you live.  I've actually been pretty happy with the Clear hotspot for my usage, but I'd a switch to wired internet to ease the strain on my wallet without sacrificing on performance.

I debated whether or not to post this here but decided to when the rain came down heavy this morning. Last blood drive there were many no-shows of people who signed up to donate (about 70% no-show) and we think it was partly due to the rain that day. About 10% of our sign-ups for this coming drive tomorrow have already canceled in the last week so there are some spots open for walk-ins.

If you are over 110 lbs., and want to donate to a good cause then please come by! All pints of blood are received and processed at the Blood Bank of Hawaii to support the institutions all over the state that need them. Even if one redditor decides to show up I will feel that this is a successful post!

He also believes it's fair to say that Caldwell will probably get the lion's share of Carlisle's votes, given that rail seems to be the key election issue. For my part, I feel that this visualization definitely shows Oahu's ambivalence about the rail.

- We have a 2 hour window to enjoy the space.

- I will be there at 6:15 to 6:40 pm to give a heads up on the time change to any redditor who did not read my many threads. After that

- I am not bringing wine. To quench the thirst of an estimated party of 25, and tea.

- I'll try to be there by 7:15 pm to greet any fellow redditors. I'll have a sign and a fedora hat with a Mario on the side of it. I'll also be wearing a blue shirt.

_______________________________________________________________
Just spoke to Obiwan-VinegarStrokes over the phone for advice on how to handle this thing. He said that I should pull a boss move, I will pick a menu.

- [The Firenze](http://i.imgur.com/3X25n.png) - $21.00 per person (not including tax and 21% tip)
- [The Sicilia](http://i.imgur.com/2Knfe.jpg) - $21.00 per person (not including tax and 21% tip)

I'm still leaning towards ""The Firenze"" as it has salad for the vegetarians, I don't have to get into a discussion about what to choose, unlike the Sicilia where you have to choose from each set.







___________________________________________________________
~~THE IMPORTANT STUFF~~

~~Just spoke to Kalei from Buca di Beppo. For a party this large

- ~~[The Classico](http://i.imgur.com/hhMQ3.jpg) - $25.95 per person (not including tax and 21% tip)~~
- ~~[The Milano](http://i.imgur.com/SXUTU.png) - $23.00 per person (not including tax and 21% tip)~~
- ~~[The Firenze](http://i.imgur.com/3X25n.png) - $21.00 per person (not including tax and 21% tip)~~

~~Here's the thing: I haven't been getting that many responses. I've PM'd people individually, I'm not expecting a lot of people to give me their choice, PLUS come to an agreement on what they'd like to eat from the menu by 9:55 am tomorrow.~~

~~**So, I'm prepared for the bashing and real-life down votes. ~~

~~LET ME REPEAT THIS IF YOU'RE SKIMMING: I'm ordering Firenze if there is a) No real decision among all of us or b) There is no decision at all.~~

~~Please let me know as soon as you can. Mahalo
