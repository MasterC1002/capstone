1368488130.0,1ea1ip,"""The Naruto Headband"", or, ""The Best Worst Interview, Ever.""",derpleberry,34, we have crazy flexible hours and we pride ourselves in our local reputation.  

Part of this is because of our **extremely deliberate hiring process.**  We get about 100 applicants every week

We really don't hire *just anyone*
So do our clients

So, Al, called me into his office and asked me to conduct my very first interview.

Now, that I'm not even done with my training - but interviews are the purview of managers and shift supervisors.  I mentioned as such, but Al told me that this was a 'special case.'  

""We are counting on you, Derpleberry.  I expect a great deal from you.""    

With that

About three minutes later

Oh my god

I am going to take my time about describing this kid

(And please, we require **business casual** and there is no way this kid got this far in the hiring process without being told at least **three times.**)

He was wearing:  
* Skinny blue jeans that were so tight I could easily see tendons and bone structure
* Beat-up old Converse sneakers covered with what appeared to be homemade Rageface patches.  
* A red
* Black
* A goddamned Naturo headband.

*A goddamned Naruto Headband.*

""You're wearing a Naruto headband
Now, and quite clearly, '*How the fuck did you make it past the first two stages of the vetting process, you ridiculous child?*'  

He, how completely appropriate!*' and said, with an expression of such sheer smuggery I wish I could adequately describe it, ""Oh, you recognize my headband.  Plus one to you! I was almost worried I'd have to deal with some lame-ass suit!""

And then

I want you to understand how very loose I am being with that word, 1988, in the small town of [suburb].""  

I stared at this fucking Facebook-profile-styled autobiography in numb shock for about five minutes while he rambled on about 'suits' and how they just don't 'get' anything about anything and I don't even fucking know.  

As I flipped through the pages

1) I had initially assumed the kid was about 18

2) There was no work experience in it.  

Anywhere at all.  

He'd gone to college and that was it, TV shows and bands he liked and what they'd taught him and how he basically felt that college was completely beneath him.  
He'd never even held a fucking paper route.

I looked up at this kid and I said, you'd like to reschedule this interview for another time?""

""No.  Why? Is there a problem?""

""Yes

I asked him if he'd received the *multiple* calls setting up and confirming the interview, and, in fact, had **very carefully** defined what was meant by 'business casual'.

He said

I had no god-damned words.  

""Well, ""I figured, you know, this is me.  This is who I am.  If you can't 'deal' with that, then maybe I don't even **want** this job.""

""That's extremely convenient

""Well great!"" he said with a gigantic smirk.  ""When do I start?""

What.  Holy unbelievable fucking Jesus Christ almighty, fake-glasses-wearing face, he is patiently waiting for me to tell him when his first day of work will be and I still cannot stop staring at that fucking Naruto headband.

""You don't, not ever.  When I said 'this interview is over', I did not mean that in a good way.  ""

He is still not understanding.  ""But you didn't even ask me anything

""Yes, so very flippantly, had told me everything I needed to know about him.

""You don't know shit about me, give me my fucking interview.""

For the sake of not causing a physical incident, I carefully explained that his 'rights' here consisted entirely of leaving the building before I had him removed for trespassing.

And now this kid starts shouting at me, that he's a billion times better than me and when he's a millionaire he'll buy this company just so he can fire me.

When that somehow fails to procure immediate employment, **begs me for a job**.  

His mother
If I don't give him this job, and it will be my fault.

""I'll cope

So there's me, chairs all knocked over, staring off into space and wondering *what the fuck just happened.*

And then Al, ""What did you think?""

""You know

""Okay

And he walks away.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**~UPDATE~**

So, the first step of the hiring process, was *completely different* than the one he gave to me, to the point where it was *very clearly* written by someone else entirely.  

His online resume also noted his lack of work experience

We're basically positive his mother wrote it for him.

That online resume was employable
When he came in dressed like an alien douchemonster, Al sent him to me.

Not so much as a test to see how I'd respond

*So,uh,* work associates *of his in Alabama. We got hungry and decided to get a couple of hot dogs and sodas, so we went to a vender. We got there, and there was this African American girl (they used to call them colored girls back then) trying to get a hot dog and a soda, but the guy wouldn't sell her nothin'. She gave up and went and sat on the bench. My father was a very liberal man. He looked at the guy and said ""Give me three hot dogs and three sodas."" The guy gave him the hot dogs and sodas and my father told me to go give the little colored girl a hot dog and a soda. The guy looked pissed, right, son?"" My father looks him dead in the eye and says ""You ever heard of the Mafia?"" Our hot dogs and sodas were free that day.*

So doing the regular Tech support role in a call centre. You all know how it is. Some of the job is great and you really feel good when you get a genuine nice person and you can help them and then there are the times you feel like you want to go to their house and kick their door in. 

This client I had was definitely the latter.  This guy was arrogant
Apparently a woman wouldn't be as good as myself at helping him because ""They don't understand technical issues""   What a fucking twat. I never once agreed with him

We did the normal steps and I found a fault with cables out side his property. The testing was pretty conclusive and I told him we needed to book a tech. He wasn't happy at the delay but agreed. 
I booked the tech - most faults booked in Australia have a 24 - 48 hr turn around. So I booked this on a Wednesday

So Wednesday night he calls back and gets me.
""Where is the tech?""

""It's only been 4 hours since I booked it sir

""This is bullshit

""We can discuss compensation after the fault is resolved""

""No

""Look

""You're all fucking useless""

This went around for about 10 minutes. He just constantly argued and abused me calling me all sorts of things. 

One thing I failed to mention in the beginning. This dude lived next door to me. So damn close that I could look over my fence and see directly into his house. 

I thought it was rather funny and coincidental but that was about it. Didn't really read much into it. 

So the following day he calls back.
""Why the FUCK isn't it fixed yet?!""

*I look up the tech notes who advised the dudes cable pit is basically destroyed but he couldn't get into it because someone was parked on it and no one was home to move the car*

I tell the dude this.
He flies into a rage. This enormous rage. Holy shit this dude was going off I actually terminated the call because I was sure my ear was starting to bleed. 

That night walking home
""Fuck it"" I thought to myself.

I went and knocked on his door (This was at 8pm at night)

He answered the door looking pretty pissed off. 

""I don't want what your selling""

""I'm not selling anything.""

""What the hell do you want then""

""I wanted to show you two quick things""

""What?""

""It's in relation to your line faults""

""What? Who are you?""

""I work at (ISP). Can I show you something""

""Fine

""It will only take a moment""

He follows me outside where I point at his pit.

""That is why a tech couldn't fix your issue. Someone parked on the damn pit""

""That's not my problem""

""I assure you it is

""Fine

""Be careful who you damn well abuse over the phone
At that point I walked to my front yard and opened my door. 
His face went white. 
I then proceeded to open my windows and blast incredibly loud music until the council approved cut off time. 

The next call I got from him was remarkably calm and collected and he was very polite. 

Every time I walked home after that and saw him out the front I got a wave and a ""G'day mate""

Sorry

1352495845.0,12xlg3,Don't swear at my staff.,greenmash,138,15,22,"So quick background. I've worked in call centres for 8+ years. Held a ton of different roles and worked for about 4 different companies. 
This particular tale happened when I was a Sales Team Leader for a crappy little Australian ISP. 
When I say crappy - I mean crappy. Upper management had recently made changes which caused the Sales

So - to the tale. 
Our call centre was that crappy that anyone calling who needed tech support was generally waiting 2 days to speak to someone. 
This meant that the sales and customer service teams copped a lot of the flack. Generally people asking to be put directly through to someone
Until this one douchebag called in.
This colossal fuckstick called in and from the greeting of my staff member he lost it. 

As a team leader I had the ability to monitor calls as they were happening

The customer was swearing like I had never heard before. He called D several things like - Scum, faggot, slope (And many more racist things). 
I was red in the face at this point but while the call was taking place I had the customers account up and I was getting as informed as I could before I took over the call. 

D started to really stress out and accidentally muttered ""shit"" under his breath. I could see his face

This is when I just jumped in on the call and muted D.

The prick on the phone wanted a written apology and 3 free months of access because he was abused. 
I was ""Uh huh""ing and ""of course"" just to see how far he would go. 

Once he finished I gave my ""counter offer"" as it were..

""Ok

""WHAT?""

""I heard what you called my staff member you fucking disgusting prick, and if you try to call up and get someone else a nice big alert will pop up on there screen saying you are a racist scumbag. Does abusing someone over the phone make you feel big, mate? Well, one last piece of advice for you. Don't abuse people who have access to your address, name, phone number and most of all, your credit car details. Good bye.""

I then ended the call. 
Turned out as I was in my rant
I fully expected to get reported for that

I left that place not long after. But because we were not monitored from upper management there were a lot of other weird stories like that.",self,t5_2urem,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/12xlg3/dont_swear_at_my_staff/

So, the last few months, he was paying $10/mo for his highspeed internet. Considering our smallest internet plan is $40/mo, he should consider himself lucky. I started getting pissed and a bit ranty.

At first, he'd talked to our Loyalty department (also known as cancellations), and with their refusal to give him rock bottom prices, had set up an order to cancel his service at the end of this billing cycle. So, I knew that I had no obligation to lower his prices. If he couldn't come to acceptable terms with Loyalty, then that was that. I had to either convince him that the prices were, in fact, or let him go.

So, lots of rural people out in the middle of nowhere, a low population density, and a lot of wiring to replace.

Him: ""I'm not paying for other people's internet!""

A little backstory: The inbound call center I worked at had a problem with employees taking calls but leaving them on mute so that they could take a break while the customer thought they were still waiting in the queue. To combat this

One night I came on shift to find almost 300 calls in the queue. This equated to 1 hour+ wait times and a lot of (rightfully) angry customers. As expected

My co-worker and I came up with an experiment since, ""We at XYZ understand that your time is valuable and apologize for the extended wait. If your call is important and you need to speak to a representative right away, please press 1. Otherwise, please continue to hold and the next available representative will assist you.""

Absurd

As she got ready to jump back into the queue I plugged my headset into her phone to listen. First call comes in and her ""improved"" greeting plays, how can I help you?""  We hear the customer gasp and say, ""It worked! Uh... Yes I need...""  

He was so thrilled by the idea that he had skipped the line that he forgot to be mad about the hour wait.  We let this continue for 5 more calls and each customer was an absolute pleasure to deal with. 

Worried that our boss would catch us we changed her greeting back and

We thought about suggesting that the company offer this ""service"" on high call volume days but we felt the public would figure out what was happening and then the backlash would be worse. 

TL;DR: We let customers think they were skipping ahead of everyone else and they forgot to be angry about waiting an hour to talk to us. ",self,t5_2urem,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/16blz3/if_you_would_like_to_skip_the_line_press_1_an/

He then says I will never use your company again I get a big smile on my face and say that's right sir you will not use our company or ""sister company"" because you have been put on our do not rent list.

I work for a company that sells out its customer service services to large companies. I landed myself in chat support for a big electronics retail chain, it's where we'll send you.

In any case within the past month or so we had a big fuck up. Someone misplaced a decimal or a line of code and one of the items on our site was temporarily listed as on sale for $0.01. People from all over swarmed to get this ""deal"" and by the time the big company found out about it

We started getting chats immediately about this, and a lot of pissed-off customers.

""Hey

""Oh, so we're canceling the orders.""

""YOU CAN'T DO THAT

No

or

""THAT'S BAIT AND SWITCH!""

Yeah, we didn't. (this one was sadly the most common argument)

or

""BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY GOT THEIR COPY.""

They got it outside the terms of use because of a site error and it was a digital download. Had it been a physical item

But in this case the item in question had a listing in its description saying it was only purchasable and free with a specific item in question. The fact that they could add it to the cart at all without that item was a site error. Our conditions of use pretty clearly had a section on us being allowed to cancel orders as part of a site error.

All of this we had to piece together on our own the first day. We were broad-sided by this issue, but it was pretty much exactly what we pieced together. 

The hilarious thing was about 80% of the customers were demanding they get their product because they PAID GOOD MONEY for it and THEY DESERVE IT. The company probably ended up refunding thousands of pennies worth of orders over this mistake.

I find it amazing how justified people can make themselves feel over having paid a penny for a site error. My favorite quote:

""BUT I NEED THAT MONEY FOR GAS TO GET TO WORK. YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME HOMELESS""

Yeah, why did you spend it in the first place?

The Dialer is an automatic calling system that identifies people who are less than 30 days past due, make your payments).

Background: I'm a customer service rep for a telecommunications company in Canada. An awesome one, and they actually mean it. We do phone, internet, and TV, and this guy had phone and internet.

This guy, I didn't see a single note in the history. He starts off by saying that normally, his business handles his standard paperwork and bills for him, and his new secretary had mentioned that his phone bill seemed kinda high.

He looked at it, got me, and asked me if the pricing seemed off at all. He was nice and friendly, just seemed a little concerned.

I pulled up the bill and struggled to not gasp out loud. Holy hell

So

The guy's been paying over $100 a month, I checked it as far back as 2007). For long distance. His bill was typically about $200 a month...

Joe: *laughs in a friendly way* ""Yeah

Me: *Looks it up* ""Let's see... your internet plan was grandfathered about a year ago

Joe: ""We've been paying bad rates for that long?""

Me: ""Erm, when long distance was kind of hard, but technology has come a long way since then. Modern plans are massively better.""

Joe: ""Couldn't your company have changed it for us?""

Me: ""Well

Joe: ""Did you ever try to contact us?""

Me: ""Yep. Blah blah blah (you're on the list for e-mail, which are both sales and to get you on modern plans, but you probably ignored it because people tend to think it's bothersome spam. Really, you should check with us occasionally to make sure your plans keep up with the times) Blah.""

Me: ""Not only am I doing that, maybe three months, but I'm going to go back six months, and rerate your long distance plans as if you were on this new plan. So, it's $6/month, that'll be $36 staying on your account, but I'm going to wipe the rest. I don't even know how much it'll be

I hear some pretty stupid things from our members every day and on weekends most of the facepalm moments come from members who don't understand how financial institutions work.

Some background information:

1. Banks do not process on the weekends or holidays because all information has to be processed through the Federal Reserve

2. In our terms and conditions for loans and credit cards, and online banking (including our mobile app) until a payment is made and processes through. 

3. Those same terms and conditions say that after so many days of delinquency we will take the payment from any account that you have legal title to (including joint accounts). This automatic system runs at processing between midnight and 6am and we lovingly refer to it as ""nightstalker"".

So, by the time the nightstalker system is activated, the account has been fully restricted (i.e. debit cards/online banking not working).

Towards the end of my shift yesterday, no processing until MONDAY night.

Me: You have $3500 and 57 cents.

**Gentleman:** But I've read on the news that you have to do this now.

**Me:** No

**Gentleman:** Well I still want these websites blocking.  I need to protect my family from these sites.

**Me:**  Well we can't block any website unless ordered to do so by the high court.  You can filter certain websites through the settings in your router

**Gentleman:** Well how am I supposed to protect my family if you can't help?

**Me:** You are able to go online and research how to do this.  It is something that can be done

**Gentleman:** No

**Me:** Yes

Customer calls, get into the account, no worries. I realise I've spoken to this woman before and while she was a little unpleasant to listen to (sounds *super drunk*, is generally loud and kind of abrasive all the time), I didn't recall her being impolite or anything. I'd only dealt with her previous for a billing enquiry, not tech support. 

So she tells me her Internet isn't working, and ask her to try moving around a bit to see if we can strengthen the signal at all (she's got one of those wireless dongles). I also try to ask if she's been able to successfully connect at her location before, but around this time she starts yelling that she can't hear me.

The woman continues to yell down the phone ""I CAN'T HEAR YOU"", and I start speaking louder (coworkers start to look over to find out why I'm practically yelling at this woman), and let her know that I've done all I can for the volume. At this point she asks to be transferred to another agent who she can hear (hello, we're a fucking call centre, did you ever consider maybe it's *your* phone?) - I check with a supervisor if he's okay with this and he tells me nope, no one's available, she'll have to call back if that's what she wants. Relay this to the customer, but at this point I don't care

So again

At this point this woman starts yelling to transfer her to someone who 'knows what they're talking about'. I, and that this is the standard troubleshooting procedure. Then she starts to demand a supervisor. I tell her a supervisor will tell her the same thing, but check with the same one as before to see if he wants to talk to her, who tells me he's just clocked out, and our other supervisor is on break. Take the she-beast off hold and tell her there aren't any supervisors available right now, would she be okay if one calls her back when they're available? 

She yells down the phone that *no*, or I can get a supervisor to call her back. Eventually she gives up and says she'll call tomorrow and hangs up (so much for needing it fixed *right now*, I guess).

The next day I talked it over with my agents and I think we figured out what had happend - next to the resort is a golf course. Now, not 10, but 15 minutes *away* from the lights of the village into pitch blackness, and ended up in this tunnel on the golf course on her way to dinner.

So this isn't an angry customer or a stupid customer story; It's a legitimately crazy person story.

I used to work in a small call center at a factory that made boilers and furnaces. Normally we only spoke to our products' distributors

Our coworker Steve was one of the most patient men I’ve ever known. Accordingly, he put her on speaker phone, at which point a less tactful coworker overheard their conversation. “Is this lady crazy?” he asked. And Carol overheard. A few days later, our company received [this letter](http://imgur.com/a/M8jD5) from her in the mail.

As you can read in the letter, or damaging things. Among the most memorable of these incidents was the time that they came in and reconfigured her staircase. To me, the most heartbreaking part is when she lists the things they have done, (theft, vandalism, harassment), but then laments: “And, never once have they ever knocked on the door and asked to come in!”

In some ways, at least you’re not convinced that people are secretly installing fake air ducts in your house, stealing your empty shampoo bottles, and reconfiguring your stairway.

I get a call from someone who theoretically is a claimant (wife of the other driver).  The issue is that we don't have any of their information.  She starts out the call stating she wants this process to be as easy as possible

I request her husbands contact information (name, make, and model of the vehicle that he was driving.  Its at this point that things go sideways.  She keeps telling me she doesn't want to be involved.  I explain that I'm *not* involving her, but I do need the information on her husband so I can speak with him.  This is a rear end accident and *we hit them*, so it should require 2 phone calls and 15 minutes to handle provided I can contact both parties.  Instead I spend 3x that arguing with her.

Now she starts saying ""The police told me it would be better if you got the information from them"".  I laugh it off the first time and say ""Well, this isn't the way it works and the police would probably shoot us if we started making thousands of requests).

I reiterate that I'm only asking for basic information and that she won't have any further involvement.  I let her know this will speed up claim handling over waiting for that information to come in and that this is the easiest most efficient way of handling the claim.  She goes back to ""I don't want to be involved in this claim!"" and ""The police told me that you should get the information from them!""

Instead I say ""Ok, then ask a passive aggressive question about how your own stupidity is going to make this take 3x longer than it needs to?

At this point, and moving on.  Over a week later, the claim still sits there with none of her husbands information in it.  I'd have resolved the claim days ago if I had his information.  Nope, we're going to wait on the police report because that is better!

She calls me deaf, and when I try to verify the spelling of her street (Delaware) she calls me stupid and asks me ""WHAT THE HELL KINDA EDUCATION DID YA GET MA'AM.""  I mute myself, and breathe deeply and remind myself that it will all be worth it when I can hang up (ha). I kept considering just transferring her to Escalations (People who deal with irate customers) but every time I almost do, she becomes almost bearable and I just decide to soldier through.  

So, and annoyances, I finally push her payment through.

The next part restored a bit of my faith in people's parenting skills.

1364079057.0,1avtj9,My first death threat...,ThisIsKellen,56,5,26,"I was just doing my job one night on the very first day back to university

I was calling his wife but he picked up, I awoke his children, the school is so greedy, etc.

But then he started coming at me in particular: he started to call me a fucking idiot and constantly questioned how stupid I was and that my job is pointless and that I'm a worthless human being. Then came the threats...He said he would come to my university, choke me to death and I believe he also said he would stab me a couple of times. Finally I just hung up on him. I was shocked but amused at the same time. I told my boss and we laughed about it, and I continued to work until the end of my shift.

Apparently, literally. He went online, found out who my boss was, contacted his supervisor and threatened her life too! He only left a voicemail, but how stupid can you be? Making death threats to two different people, we have all his information and now we have his cell phone, did he really think he was being inconspicuous? Anyway, I politely declined. I was not even faded by the whole thing and the only reason that the supervisor called in the first place was because she was concerned for my safety since I am technically one of her employees as well.

When the call drops in

I informed the dude of this and that's when I started getting the attitude. Apparently I didn't know what was wrong as this issue reoccurs constantly. A powercycle only fixes it for about 10 minutes and he hasn't been able to be online for long before it boots him. I checked his records - he'd been connected for over 9 hours solid - and receiving data. 

I told the guy that I can see all the information to know that hes been connected and downloading. He called me a liar and quite rudely suggested I find someone who knows whats going on because I was quite ""stupid""

""No""

""What do you mean no?""

""Exactly that. No. I know whats going on

""I demand to speak to someone else - I don't need your help anymore""

""Well

This dude lost it at this point and started screaming - loudly. And to the point where his voice was breaking and it was more like a squeal.
And I don't know why it slipped out
I didn't hit the mute

""WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?!""

""Well, your voice, it.. it goes high pitch and you start sounding like a chipmunk.""

""I want to speak to your manager!""

""Yeah.. that's not gunna happen. You see

""I'll call back and complain""

""So? Last day. Remember? I told you about 20 seconds ago? Call back. Complain. What're they going to do? Sack me?""

I kept laughing at him and hung up. 
I then packed my stuff and left.

About 2 weeks later I got an sms from my old manager who had just listened to the call recording and she was... not impressed. 
When she called the guy back to apologize he told her he had completely forgotten about the call but now he's been reminded he wanted compensation.

We had recently had a new system implemented that would track our call times and break times based on us putting in a code to set our phone to ""away"" mode if we needed to grab a coffee, we'd be counselled on it.

We were also given a brief 1 minute window after each call that was for finishing up file notes etc. once the customer hung up

Shortly after this system was implemented

If your call ends at, you would go into ""file note"" mode until 5:02pm, at which point your phone would ring again if there were people waiting.

On this day

In a team of 20 people

The next day, to ensure it wouldn't happen again. This took nearly 45 minutes(!) for everyone to grasp at which point there were protests that ""it's not fair"" that they should be expected to keep answering calls ""after the lines have closed"".

My manager then pointed to me and asked ""what's more fair

So anyway I was at my desk this day when a call dropped in

It turns out that he abused the cabin crew because he had to have a aisle seat in the middle row and not the window row.  When he couldn't get his own way he started acting out being verbally abusive and then started to threaten the cabin crew with violence.  At that point the cabin crew called airport security and had him removed from the flight and placed on another flight leaving the next day (to give him time to cool down).  Due to this he felt that he deserved some sort of compensation for his trouble and the humiliation that he felt being led of the plane. 

When he was done I calmly told him that I was not willing to provide said compensation and that the flight crew was within there right to have him removed.  This set him off again.  He was going to sue me, sue the airport security.  He was a vertran and a loyal customer of this airline (looking at his bookings this was the only flight he'd taken with us and it had been booked with credit card points.)  Anyway this went on for about another 5 minutes of him screaming and me telling that we where going around in circles before my senior gave me the O.K to end the call.

So I work for a company that supplies outsourced customer service to some pretty big companies. I work in the division that services a department store that largely deals in electronics and similar fare. Our job is to take chats all day and largely act like a massive placebo


So 50% of my job is pretty much telling people they have to call the hotline number to solve their problem


""Sorry our return policy is only X days.""

So here's the first one:


This lady chats in saying that she bought a hard drive and the USB cable that came with it doesn't fit into the computer. Now I show her some pictures and ascertain that the HD has multiple USB slots, and a USB B on the other. Most computers only have a USB A on them. It took me fifteen minutes of questioning to end up telling the customer to flip the cable around and try plugging the A end into the computer and the B end into the HD. This was followed by the inevitable:


""Oooooohhhhh.""


I mean really? Was that too hard to figure out? The worst part was this wasn't the first time it had happened this week. The other one was 25 minutes and extended well past closing time because the customer was trying to plug the USB B into the computer and the USB A into the printer. I figured this out ten minutes into the conversation and told her to flip it around


""I see! My bad.""


The other five minutes was me telling her how to install programs from a disc.


But the chat I had tonight took the damn cake. It lasted a good 13 minutes past closing


So this customer chats in and says they can't log in. It takes me a good five to seven minutes to figure out they're trying to log in using their loyalty account. I explain that they actually need to use their main website account to make transactions


A few minutes pass and they say.


""Okay. So how do I use my loyalty on the website?""


I assume everything is in the clear and they have their account all ready to go. Hahaha, ""I don't see them."" ""I can't find it."" ""Are you sure your information is right?"" Towards the end I literally copy/pasted the contents of the damn page to the customer into the chat and said, 


""So you see none of this on the My Account screen?""


""No! I just see a place where it tells me to log in! None of that's there!""

hello

I work at a call center that's name starts with uni and ends with SYS. on a project supporting a very large software company. 



I don't usually take calls in this call center I do some tool programming for the tools that the other agents do to make their jobs easier. spending hours apon hours doing this programming in a phone code I have been given for this task. also called a NR code.

as I wandered into work this morning at 1:00 am to start my shift I found out that everyone will be getting a raise. I was excited by this as a raise is a good thing. the night sup started calling others into the back training room one by one and they all came out with smiles on their faces. 


&gt; fast forward a few hours


my turn comes around and im taken into the back for my turn chatting with the sup. turns out not only will I not be getting a raise my pay is being docked 1$ per hour and im being put on a written warning. the reason you may ask? 


my NR time is too high. it turns out. they are not exempting my time that I spend doing this tool programming because its not relevant to the job. turns out the manager that has been asking me to do the programming didn't tell anyone that's what I have been doing in this NR code and has been claiming that he is writing these tools. this manager has also been getting bonuses for these tools that ""he"" is writing. bonuses to the effect of $1000 or so.

Confused, I ask her what the issue was, and the following ensued.

Me: So you want quotes for two different policies?

Her: No

M: Ma'am that isn't possible

H: I want to speak with [my manager] right now.

M: She's actually on another call at the moment. 

Inexplicably, calling me incompetent, insulting me, all the usual stuff. I shut off my brain and just went through my escalation script, saying that I would have someone call her back. She then attacks me saying that we had stated that anyone here could help her, and clearly I could not. Whatever, don't need your sass today. She ends the call, meanwhile my manager calls her back

1375380876.0,1jicmq,The time I accidentally laughed loudly at an annoyed customer.,panda-from-eagle-ash,61,16,15,"Hey guys

Anyway, plus some clothing and the like from customers from pretty much all over Europe.

I worked in an inbound-call based Customer Services department

I thought I'd drop by and tell you about an occasion where I accidentally and very loudly laughed at an annoyed customer.

------------------------------------------

This instance occurred on a fairly slow-going day, lots of the call centre staff are sat around without phones to answer, and so are quietly responding to customer emails. At the time of this call, I was the only person in my intimidate vicinity not taking a call, so everyone is listening to whatever I'm saying during this call. A female customer rang in and was absolutely livid from the moment I took the call. She got an email from us to say that when their parcel of items arrived at our warehouse, we found that some items were missing from the parcel.

So far, or maybe a parcel was sent to the wrong sorting department by mistake. These problems are resolved really easily nine times out of ten.

I can practically sense that this customer is simmering on the edge of exploding throughout this call. They've already screamed at me with the usual '**HOW DARE YOU SAY I HAVEN'T SENT MY ITEMS. YOUR COMPANY IS A COMPLETE SCAM. I SENT EVERYTHING TO YOU**'

So, basically anything that will help us get this shit sorted out.


Now, so the sentence I hear is *'I'm going to need a physical description / of what you're wearing'*.

Now, no wanting to laugh at the customer. As they customer starts to go on a very lengthy description of what their parcel looked like, the fact that I'm not allowed to laugh makes this whole thing funnier. At this stage my condition has worsened from mild giggle to full laugh, and it is becoming harder and harder to fight it. Soon, biting my lips isn't enough to suppress this laugh. I have to forcefully try to keep my jaw together to hold back this monster. Not only that, the sentence *'I'm going to need a physical description of what you're wearing'* keeps running through my mind, and each time its funnier and funnier. The laugh is still growing in strength like some sort of Dragonball Z villain as they charge up an attack.

This is too much for just me to bear, but tries to choke it back. He is sat next to me almost shaking with how much he is trying not to laugh at me. I can see that he is trying not to laugh, and this just makes things funnier for me. I am desperately trying to will myself to remain silent at this point, the customer is finishing up their description, and I know it will be my turn to talk soon, but I genuinely don't know if I'm up to the task. I have no idea if I will be able to suppress this mighty belly beast trying to push itself though my throat and down the phone at this pissed off woman.

If she hears me laugh, but I can't say anything to buy myself that time. The words come out of my mouth, but I don't speak them, I squeak them. I make a high-pitched little chirp that I rush, wanting to get the words out an done with as quickly as I can, saying *'Imjsutgonnamakeanoteofallthat'*.

I'm struggling to write down the things she said to me, and turn to see me and my colleague trying savagely not to laugh. I've pushed my entire fist into my mouth and my shoulders are going up and down like jack-hammers, my entire body is shaking from the unimaginable force of trying to keep this laugh under wraps.

I can't speak. I genuinely can't say anything to this woman for fear I will break. Everyone else around me starts to laugh out loud. People have to get up and leave the room to make things easier for me. It has now been a very noticeable few seconds since I have said anything

My entire body is shaking. There are tears rolling down my face and I am in genuine pain from suppressing laughter for this long. Everyone around is laughing out loud and its time for me to speak.

I start to talk but can't hold back the occasional slip. *'Okay Madam, but this time its just too much. I completely lose it. *'I'm goifffppppp...goinstttuuppp... I'm going to pass this alohohoahahahaHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA'*

The laughter erupted out of me like a dam that's just given way to the immense force of the ocean. That's it. I've broken. I've laughed at an annoyed customer and cant stop myself. Everyone around me is in complete hysterics and my colleague next to me completely turns away from me so I cant see him laughing. I keep laughing without the ability to stop for another good few seconds. 

The customer has gone completely silent. After a few seconds they break the silence with *'Are you okay?'* I just about manage a quick *'no'* before breaking into another burst of laughter and a barrage of apologies.

Anyway, took their info, passed it to the relevant people and got everything sorted for them.

Then we all lived happily ever after.

When you get a good rep and the reason you are calling in is you screwed something up and want them to fix whatever problem it is that YOU caused and company policy dictates the rep simply cannot give you the unicorn ride you so desperately desire

Giving a resounding NO to the all important question does NOT hurt the company...in fact you just saved them money by paying the poor rep who had the bad luck to be the one to take your call less money

Ever wonder why you keep getting bounced from department to department over and over?  We keep track in the remarks of your account how you acted last time you called and it will show if you were an ass(written in a very nice way of course)

You are now a hot potato and whoever ends up with you is the one who potentially gets the bad survey because you screwed over the last guy and no one wants to talk to you because they will get whatever survey you leave

BTW If you automatically ask for a supervisor after acting like a prick to us we can go get the supe who is burnt out and wouldn't walk across the street to pee on you if you were on fire or the one who just got back from vacation and might be more agreeable to whatever you want(creditwise) that is solely our choice

We hear there is a supe call across the room we already know if you were an overentitled jerk or someone who has a legitimate concern about his account just by who we see taking the escalated call

Last BTW If you lie to us we will KNOW...EVERYTHING gets either automatically notated by the system or we put it in for the next rep and all calls are recorded and a supervisor WILL listen in to the last call if you claim the rep said something they did not say",self,t5_2urem,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/1ebcrc/let_me_explain_how_the_survey_you_got_after_your/

Onto the doozy though:

I was working late

Next morning I get a call from the same guy complaining we changed his interest rate

A few weeks go by and I get the same guy

The son explains that their business is failing and they are about to go under

Not one week later I get a letter from a solicitor advising that the callers are going to sue me,000 payment. Company gets involved and I end up going to court over me explaining their failing business' best options. 

Case gets thrown out, I get calls from them from start to finish, every day for a week. So I discuss it with our solicitor and technically they aren't harassing me, they're harassing the company so the company goes to court and end up winning around $10,000 in compensation (way too much). 

So finally I don't have to deal with these morons anymore

The file comes up again on my workload and I see that they're now uncontactable, door knocks, nothing gets through. So I send a text to both numbers.  My phone is immediately ringing, the son. He tells me his dad killed himself over owing so much money and trying to grief me into apologizing and waiving everything. (I can't, I don't have that level of power) I give an extension, hang up and another call, it's the dad. 

The dad says his son has just disappeared and he's in such grief

They still owe the company money and I'm sure they do this with other companies

TL;DR father and son try to sue me because they didn't have any money to pay back a debt. Harass me

Roughly 7 nanoseconds after I push the 'ready' button on our phone software, which is fine, nothing I haven't seen before:

“Thanks for calling _____ _____ Home Mortgage

“Alright I have the account up

“ISN'T IT RIGHT THERE ON YOUR SCREEN??”

“Yes sir I have your full account information in front of me

“DON'T GIVE ME THAT BULLSHIT! Rage rage rage..” 

I'll spare you the tumultuous details, so it takes another 10 minutes just to agree on the amount he owes. I can hardly get a sentence out before being interrupted (being interrupted was one of the most frustrating parts of my job as a whole I think, not just a problem with this guy). It's clear this guy needs mortgage assistance or he'll never be caught up, and probably lose his home*. In my head I groan, this means a discussion on what plans are available and filling out a worksheet with more of his financial stuff. I offer to update his information and start the review and get “FINE, but only to show you what a WASTE of TIME this is!”. Normally this process only takes about 20 minutes, but seeing as how this guy has argued about every nugget of information I estimate it will take about an hour. Of course I have to explain why we need this and that (income, etc.) for every item. Finally we get to the end and he is within the range to be considered for the Home Affordable Modification Project (HAMP). I explain that I can assign a specialist to his account

“Wh-What?”

I patiently reiterate.

“WHY DID NOBODY EVER EXPLAIN THIS TO ME BEFORE? NOW MY CREDIT IS RUINED AND rage rage rage..” 

“Sir our agents are required to offer to start this review to any borrower more than a month past due

“YEAH BUT NO ONE EVER TOLD ME THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY HELP ME”

… Wut? Best I can reply come up with is: 

“Well we don't know what options are available until after we update your information

At this point I just desperately want to get this guy off of my phone and transfer him to his assigned specialist. After several accusations of “YOU SHADY FUCKS ARE HIDING THESE PROGRAMS FROM US BECAUSE YOU JUST WANT TO TAKE OUR HOMES” and other pleasantries I'm finally able to connect him with the specialist and send him on his way

So the call center I work for is an all-purpose answering service.  We answer everything from doctors and lawyers to tech support and emergency assistance.  There's few things we don't handle.  Jack-of-all-calls, save for that it caters to rich white people (and I mean like multiple homes and multiple yachts for each one rich).  So obviously many of the people we talk to are rather entitled folk not used to not getting things their way and most definitely not used to being told ""no"".  Most are fine, some are even pleasant, but there are always the others...The people we talk to are usually older people unable to wrap their minds around the newfangled contraptions or, my personal favorite, people who don't trust putting their credit card info onto a website.  I get perverse joy from these especially because we take their orders and submit their CC info on literally the exact same website.  We do not have a special system, we pull up the company's site and place an order

So this past holiday season said company had many (hideous) featured holiday items in their latest catalog.  Catalog time always means a ramp up in calls and

Me:  ""Good evening, how can I help you?""

Customer:  ""Hello

Me:  ""Certainly

She gives me the item number of what she wants

Me:  ""Oh, or I can leave a message for our main office who can let you know when the tie is back in stock?""

Customer:  ""...sold out?""

Me:  ""Yes

Customer:  ""...but I just got the catalog in the mail today

Me:  ""Er, this item has been very popular and unfortunately did sell out quickly.""

Customer:  ""But I JUST got this in the mail TODAY

Now obviously this was several months ago so I don't remember the exact exchange too well, apparently) and demanded I have someone from the office call her because ""they have to have one somewhere and I am going to have it.""

So in our call centre we deal with inbound calls from our clients. These clients are energy companies

On to the story:

My female colleague is what you would call ditzy she says stupid things without thinking and leaves herself open for easy comebacks/jokes /puns. She is very friendly and this comes across in her calls. Through luck of the draw she ends up with the same offshore agent calling through five times in 10-15 minutes. He is so happy with her friendliness that he asks her to email him as she is so nice. Being the polite person she is


This should have been the end of that; however an unbreakable bond had been forged. At least in the eyes of our love struck offshore agent.

The two exchange a few emails back and forth:

Agent:  “I am good thank you

Colleague: “Yes thanks I like both my name and work. Do you enjoy yours?”

Agent: “I do yes

Colleague:  “why are you sad?”

Agent: “Is that question to personal for you?”

Now at this point those of us in the office that had been following the drama suggested that she stop responding as this was clearly going down the wrong road. However being the ditzy person she is
This was that email “hey what should I tell this guy he is a bit weird and is asking me if I have a boyfriend.”

As you all know in a call centre you are on and off calls so regularly an email that takes 20 seconds to write and send uninterrupted will take 10 minutes to take between calls. While composing the email she copied all the above correspondence with the agent to send to her friend. 

Or she thought she did. 

What she actually did was reply to the agent and not to her friend. She realised her mistake when the agent emailed her back “noted” followed 20 minutes later by “I have noted you do not like personal questions”

My colleague has freaked out at this point thinking she will loose her job or something and we are all joking with her asking when she is getting hitched

I'm usually very patient, or the fact that he kept saying ""I"" had told him all these things, when it was a different rep he had spoken with before. Surely he didn't think I was just sitting there in the office of a major cable tv company by myself, answering calls! Anyhow, I did my best to troubleshoot the issue. I apologized for his inconvenience, to which he said he did NOT want to hear any apology from me, he just wanted me to do my job and fix his movie. I deleted the pay per view movie that Jerk ordered and I went into the system and ordered it for him myself. I then told him to look on his screen to see if it had appeared, that made him even angrier at me. Now he asks me if this was the first time I've ever done this job

I'm sure by this point it was hard not to hear the disdain in my voice, and go through them one by one, by the book, no matter how long it took. He deserves the very best, right? I begin troubleshooting, and the more involved in the process he had to be, the angrier he got. When I asked him to reset his cable box, may I please tell her why you want to speak with her? So jerk proceeds to tell me how he wants to tell my manager that I don't know what I'm doing, he's wanting to try and get ME in trouble too. 

Well, but you told me you did not want my apology remember? Furthermore you started off the call by---this is as far as I got, because he started screaming at me! ""Don't you tell ME how to start MY phone call! I've had to walk YOU through these steps, you don't know what you are doing blah blah blah rant rant rant. At this point I got really quiet and just let him rant on while I waited for his cable box to finish resetting. He finally shut up and I asked him what was showing on his screen. He said his tv channels were back, so I once again went in and ordered the movie for him using my system. It still did not show up on his screen as it was supposed to. He gets all whiney again and asks for my manager, so I ask his permission to place him on hold (policy again) and begin typing up my escalation request. 

30 seconds go by with me typing and worrying that I may get in trouble this time for daring to speak up for myself in the small way that I did, or b-he gave up, or c-he realized what a jerk he was being and didn't want to be embarrassed when they listened to the call if it was escalated. Either way, I am surely glad Jerk hung up! I hope his food went down good cold! I hope it was something that sucks ass reheated like tacos or fried chicken! I hope it gives him the screaming 
demon shits! Ok I'm done.

Treats me like a small child and refuses to accept anything I say as truth. Must have forgotten I have access to all of her accounts

My day started out pretty blegh as I spent one of my first calls explaining the difference between a certificate and a savings account to one of our more elderly members (80 ish) for 20 minutes.

Not long after I get this call from a raging cunt.
Right from the start I could tell this call was not going to go well. When she called in, she started to rant about how our automated system is terrible and how if she enters a number wrong she can't correct it. I started to explain to her that we ave received that complaint before and we are working on a speech recognition system, but she wouldn't let me get two words out my mouth. Every time I tried to talk she would raise her voice and speak over me.

The reason she had called was because there was a fraudulent charge on her debit card for $2.40 from 12/24. As I start to explain that I could cancel her card and send her a new one

Rinse and repeat for about 10 minutes.

Eventually

So I reply with ""Well ma'am, but a month from now it could be $600.""

Apparently this is something else she didn't want to hear which caused her to rant on about how having her card cancelled would cause all her bills to be late yada yada yada rant rant rant.

I offered to transfer her to debit card dispute to see if they would be willing to process it as a dispute (I knew they wouldn't, which I gave willingly and offered my employee ID, which seemed to have shocked her that I wasn't bothered by her tantrum. She even had the nerve to tell me she didn't want me to tell the supervisor what was going on because she didn't want me to tell MY version of it.

After that call I was shaking and red in the face from being so angry. I left a note detailing the entire exchange, one of which stated that the member had told her ""I work for the US Postal Service and I can talk to you any way I want.""

I think sometimes people like her forget that I have literally ALL of her information. Address, social security number, all account numbers, all debit and credit card numbers, codewords, all accounts associated with her account, any external checking accounts that she may have transferred to or from, middle initial

**""Well $15k is the max amount that was approved so that's the selling price.""**

Unethical and likely elderly abuse if you ask me. Even if mom agreed to it. I asked all the standard questions. *Who is driving the car? Who is to be paying for it?* And the right answers are given. I'm trying to kill this cause I don't like it. 

I escalate this to my managers and we really can't stop this from happening. Red flags went up when the application was initially reviewed and we put the mother through extra security to see if this is really what she wants to do. 

This isn't the first time I've encountered this kind of situation and it goes against my ethics but I have a job to do.

I come back to the customer and explain that the amount due is from being delinquent in payments. In that case, but now she completely flips her shit. I begin to get called every name in the book, accused of trying to rob her, and she screams at me that it's ""bullshit, 'cuz nobody done told me 'bout nothin like that!"" She then wants to know if she can pay the current bill and have the past due amount be paid off later.   

I politely explain to her that the consequences for non-payment were indeed spelled out in the contract she signed in good faith. I also let her know that, especially on a new account without a lot of payment history.  

Inside, and act like it's MY fault??? Now you want me to ""do something about it for you""? Even if there WAS a way, it would require a long-term account in good standing. There's no way your six month old account that's never been paid on time would qualify! And if by some miracle it DID, there's no way in hell I'd help you out after you've been a total bitch from the moment you came on the line!""  

But I kept calm and annoyingly polite. I told her that, and the only option was to pay the full amount due. I offered to take the payment over the phone, but stated she could also go to her local retail store and pay there, even going so far as to look up the one closest to her.  

Nope. I just get screamed at for a bit more before she hangs up on me. Luckily it was a slow day

    CCI extremely irate/belligerent over amnt due on current bill.

    acct pmt hist shows no on-time pmt beyond initial bill cyc.
    cust. is not entitled to any credits/discounts/waivers due
    to poor pmt hist and low age of acct

Or something to that effect. The sad thing is, but that I was again stereotyping customers after trying so hard not to. This, combined with many other instances of irate customers and poor floor management, began letting me see that this job was fast turning me into a vile, bitter, miserable person.

She was panicked because she had received a bill for his care.  Now, but this was several hundred dollars this woman simply didn't have.

I explained that the bill was in his name

Several minutes were spent on the phone explaining the policy in great detail and at the end of the call she went from on the verge of tears to happy and gushing about what a great job I was doing.

I worked at a ski resort for a year


The first mistake was running an ad in the paper in a very large nearby city advertising our hill. It didn't include any deals or anything, another agent and our manager are manning the phones. It's pretty quiet. The phone rings, and the other agent (we'll call her Tina) pick up. Obviously I can't hear what's being said but I watch Tina's face during the 19 minute phone call turn from bewilderment, to amusement, to frustration, to exhaustion. 


Finally the caller hangs up and we eagerly play back the call. The gist of it went something like this - caller rings up and states that she's just seen our ad in the paper and that she's like to order a pizza. Tina tells her that this is a ski resort. Caller overly excitedly claims that her name also is Tina, telling someone in the background to shut up. 


This goes on for, she just listened as the caller continued to berate whoever it was in the background and tell tales of pizza and hot tubs. We also clearly identified three changes in accent. Not 20 minutes after Tina hung up, I get a call asking for Tina. It's our favorite hot tubbing pizza eater again. Because it's slow and I am bored, I transfer her over and we sit through another 15 minute call. This time two of them have called in and they both take turns shrieking at each other (I think one was playing the part of ""mom"" and the other was the ""child"") while asking Tina about her family and private life, again while pretending to be British, or Mexican, or whatever. It was fairly amusing



**TLDR** Drunk/stoned caller calls in to a ski resort asking for pizza and changes her accent three times while shrieking into the phone.

The call started out like any other call. The student was away, which caused the unspeakable to happen. The guy started to ask questions about me and my life. Nothing overly person, just trying to learn about me as a person. 

A quick history about me. I am a graduate with a degree in electrical engineering and I have been out of school for about 2 years. I have had an extremely hard time to find a job in my field and it has been weighing heavily on me to the point of tears and depression.

Seven years I've worked a fantastic call center with truly excellent managers and quiet nights.  It's a damn good job.  There are plenty of perks and the pay is decent.  

Unfortunately, none has been moreso than Jimmy.  

Poor Jimmy.  Sad

It began before I started working there.  Jimmy was a caller on a line for mental health patients needing to make or cancel appointments.  Nothing serious.  That was all the line handled.  

Jimmy was, celebrities, chickens, and close relatives, but that didn't stop him.  I think he'd hike from wherever his little compound was up to the local gas station to place at least three calls a night.  Towards the beginning it was fine.  Nothing wild.  Just requests to speak to people who didn't exist.  

As the years went on and Jimmy's state slowly decayed, compiling a list of Jimmy's threats.  I'm just going to share mine.

1.I'm going to slice off your feet and make you walk a mile!

2.I'll boil your eyes in their sockets!

3.I'll fill your family with explosives

4.I've got a razor-blade and I'm going to cast voodoo on you!  You'll die coughing razors! (I wonder if he saw this one in a movie?)

Management has recently been pushing metrics far more than normal. They used to be fairly lenient, AHT. Our AHT goal used to be a palatable 28 minutes, but they've since rolled out some scripts and expect it to be down to - on average - 22 minutes. For calls that are nothing but networking, they expect 17.5 minutes.

This is where the problems come into play. This job is highly technical

I have tried telling management (or at least the guys above me that I *can* speak to) that this isn't an acceptable measurement for the work involved. It's falling on deaf ears

This is where my frustration escalates. I didn't take this job to fluff metrics

From what I've said thus far, and I rarely receive any complaints. In my several months here, I have only had to terminate one call due to the customer slinging personal insults at me. Almost everyone has been a pleasure to work with, or I've at least been able to deescalate them and take control of the call to resolve their problem. My most furious customers are usually singing praises before they hang up.

Don't even get me started on our sales agents. Our sales agents were ""recently"" outsourced, and misstatement of what services they are being sold. Had a customer yesterday that thought he was paying $14.95 to fix his email problem. Nope, he was paying $49.95. 

These sales agents have also caused major headaches for those of us delivering support. Non-paying customers are frequently transferred to us

On top of the sales department outsourcing, our bottom of the barrel folks aren't too great). They have also posted a video from the CEO basically stating just how insignificant we truly are, and how despite the company now finally turning a profit they need to start slimming down. 

Morale is at an all-time low. Employees have been dropping like flies. I only have a few close friends anymore. All of the other highest-qualified technicians have either left

I think that perhaps it's time for me to start packing my bags and calling it quits. Unfortunately, however, I love(d) this job because I love solving problems, not fluffing metrics. I've had a burning passion to go into business on my own, and I believe it may be time to start my own computer repair shop. At competitive rates, I would be able to work one-fourth of my current hours and come out ahead. I'd also be able to set my own hours, wouldn't have to answer to disagreeable management, though.

Basically I'm curious to here your stories about your seniors and how they made your life when working with them.

I'll start I guess.  When I first stated I worked in the bronze department which most members where so we handled the majority of calls and yes escalations over expired points

I had a call drop in and as always I introduced myself etc etc.  Pretty much the second I shut up the customer on the phone said I want to speak to a manager.  Well as you all know there would be no chance of that without finding out what happened first so I calm the customer down and explain that I need too know what's wrong so I can see if I can help before I escalate it.  It turns out that one of my colleges received a call from this customer about missing flight and was told to fuck off and hung up on.  When I heard this I was speechless I mean we've all wanted to tell a customer that but none of us where that stupid.  I asked the customer for the consultants name and when I heard it I knew straight away that the customer was telling the truth.  Anyway I put the customer on hold and go over and speak to the senior who was on duty we'll call him Frank.  So I wait for this senior to finish what he was doing on Facebook and he comes over.  

I introduce the call and it goes as one would imagine the customer was furious and really was looking at never flying with the airline again.  Long story short the call ends and I ask Frank what he intends on doing about it.  Basically I get told to mind my own business and work goes on as normal.  A couple of days later I was smoko with a few friends of mine and the incident comes up in conversation.  Basically Frank swept the incident under the carpet and nothing was done about it.  That was the day that I learnt you can do or say anything you like as long as your mates with the right people.

Sure whatever, an addon for Canadian text/data/call display /voice mail. A little over $150 for it. 

He starts in about paying for shit that he feels should be included. Specifically the texting to the USA. Because he's got a plan that allows calling to the USA and texting uses data and it takes seconds to broadcast so why does the plan not cover it? Well regardless of what portion of yhr network it uses or how long it takes to send

We go back and forth for about 10 minutes because he can't grasp the simple concept of ""is it included in your plan? No? Then you have to pay for it."" 

Finally we move onto plans that would suit him. I explained it, after repeating the details of everything 10± times, he accepts it. 

So we're done now, until you decided to ask for it to be removed. So regardless of what the plan says, you asked for that specific feature to be removed. So now you're billed for it. Imagine that?

I had to quit after that short time because I was failing in school from working 30 hours a week. (The call center was my second job to try to afford to live. I worked 4-5 days a week from 5-8pm at the call center). Sucked because the managers and most of the staff were super cool people who I loved working with. They would also let people down on their luck sleep in the call center from time to time. I mean seriously these people cared about their employees. 

It was a super low tech operation where we had paper of varying sizes with all the information on them. You'd get assigned to one campaign a night and given a stack of papers to call. Most of the managers were understanding and would keep people who knew their stuff on a single campaign for the duration. 

The big thing with them was to get people to donate via credit card as it was an assured amount (versus mailing them information). There was a weekly bonus for the person who could get the most number of credit cards and things like that. 

Some of the worst calls I made were for the local AIDS agency. Oh god I hated that campaign with all my being. Most of the information for this campaign was via the ""Dinner for a Cause"" sort of thing where people would totally forget that they put their own name on the damn list after filling out the OPTIONAL card at dinner. Nothing like getting screamed at and being told you illegally obtained their number. And then you would have to ask about a donation by which point they would scream some more and hopefully hang up. 

Another nuance of some campaigns was that people could designate departments for their donation. I was on the tail end of the local public library campaign and had a man refuse to donate unless I could guarantee that his $20 would go towards ""keeping the library open longer. You know for the kids"". I tried with all my might and patience to explain to him the options and that the best I could do was check ""Operations"" but no this did not satisfy him and he hung up. 

The company was very strict on calling hours
a woman answered the phone and after my greeting proceeded to SCREAM at me about how inappropriate it was for me to call her at ""this hour"" and that I had woken her up and now her sleep was ruined. I handed her off to a supervisor after her many demands and one of my co-workers consoled me as he could hear the entire conversation because she was screaming so loud. 

The big no-no was to answer incoming calls from your assigned line for the night. If your phone rang for some reason you were supposed to let it ring. If it kept ringing, the owner came by and he was fired on the spot. If I remember correctly he left yelling obscenities about the company while most of us had to hold calls.

Subject:       The Challenger Imperative

 

 

 

This message is intended for T-Mobile USA employees only and is not to be shared or distributed outside of T-Mobile USA *oops*

 

 

As you’ve heard today

 

This is an aggressive play that suits us perfectly as the challenger in this market. Everything we do must fall within the Challenger Strategy. We can’t lose sight of that. A recap of where we are now:

 

Amazing 4G Services. Our modernization efforts are humming along. We’ll have a smokin’
 
Value Leader. We will offer unmatched value through unprecedented transparency
 
Trusted Brand. The work we’re doing on our brand re-launch is very exciting. Still
 
Multi-segment Player. We’re making very smart
 
Challenger Business Model. If we’re going to be aggressive, we have an opportunity to simplify processes so that we do fewer things, and are able to do them better.
 
To transform the industry we will have to force it to change…..and the only way to do that is by transforming ourselves in every respect.
 
We can do it. I’ve led teams before who’ve done it
 
Here are the compelling arguments for getting on with it now…..
 
Right now our company needs to start growing our customer base
Right now we’re preparing to become a public company. We’re going to have to show investors that we can earn a great return on their investment and—right now—we are not;
Right now we have to secure our competitive position in the industry
If we do not transform this company right now
 
How do we do it…..
 
We must  give customers a compelling
We must  give investors a compelling reason to invest in our company;
We must give ourselves a compelling reason to invest our time and talents;
We must re-think our business top to bottom
We must move with agility and speed
We must be totally focused on the things that are absolutely
 
This is hard work…..
 
It means taking nothing for granted;
It means letting go of ideas and projects that are marginal
It means we have to stay focused
It means we have to sweat the details on execution;
It means we have to make sacrifices and investments before we can reap the rewards.
 
We have done part of this work already…..
 
I believe (and my belief is supported by the reaction we’re already getting from the market) in what we’ve already announced about our Un-Carrier promise, we have a lot of this planned out and are beginning to execute against these promises.
 
Now it’s time to deliver on our commitment to customers
 
Delivering on these promises will take additional investment before we can earn a return. And to make this sustainable, we're creating a very attractive proposition for investors and making a much stronger case for the moves we’re making in the marketplace.
 
Developing the Un-Carrier promise is the first of three steps we have to take…..
 
Creating an efficient
 
To get to an Un-Carrier cost structure

 

As part of this total re-examination of the cost structure, entertainment, energy, real estate and a wide range of business expenses. New guidelines on these items will be out to you shortly.

 

In addition

 

We are pausing on bringing new hires into the business. Should there be a position vacancy that is determined to be essential for the success of the business an exception may be granted by one of the executive vice presidents. We are also minimizing the use of contract and temporary hires. Leaders will continue to evaluate the needs of customer touch points and hire frontline employees as needed to ensure a high quality customer experience.

 

Instead of moving forward with salary increases

 
Beginning February 22, we will be reviewing and harmonizing all of our benefit plans.
 

I ask everyone to take the challenge to identify ways to simplify and eliminate re-work and initiatives that won’t strengthen our Un-Carrier position.  And let’s do this as we stay focused on creating the best end-to-end customer experience

 

The Senior Leadership Team and I are working hard to make each employee an owner of our company
 
Let’s go win!

1358284671.0,16n2zf,Talking a drunk installer out of working with electricity on top of a 30-foot pole. ,calladus,18,0,4,"Years ago I worked for a security manufacturer who sold its products through distributors.  The distributors would resell to installers and customers.

I was an engineering technician at this company

So, I'm on queue and hoping the phone won't ring.  Of course it does, at 4:50 pm, I'm due off work at 5.

The customer is an installer who wants to know how to connect one of our remote security cameras to the installation he has on a parking lot light pole.  He had an electrician come in earlier in the day and install the power and video cable, and properly wire the transformer to the camera.  Then plug in the video and camera data communication wires. 

The thing is

His plan is to put a 30 foot aluminum extension ladder on the side of this steel pole, and multimeter, and install the equipment.  He just needs to know, does he connect the blue wires to the white wires or what?  ""The instructions aren't really clear!""

The instructions are VERY clear.  We even have a graphic of how to connect everything.  But my first attempts to explain it seem to go right over his head.  Very quickly

First

I tried to be tactful

I asked him if there was anyone else there to help him out.  ""Naw

We were going in circles, and he admitted to me he'd been sipping whisky while on the phone with me (so he wasn't sobering up!).

Finally, I realized that he thought he was talking to a friend.

""Is that party still going on Jed?"" (not his real name!)

""No

I then spent another 20 minutes talking him out of driving home.  I didn't know what city he was in

""'Sokay

""Hello

She actually seemed to cheer up when I told her

***Wall of text ahead***


So I work for this information resource, and I wish I wasn't doing this job.



I have vented to my friends, yanno?

**Night shift**

So my first story happened on a night shift, maybe fifteen if it is busy. You can just watch movies or play games, knit or read, it is the dream work. 

But this one instant a guy called and wanted me to connect him to a phone sex number. He was obviously very aroused and his voice raspy and made me feel uncomfortable. I can’t connect to the sex lines, appearantly he wanted me. After he told me that, I hung up in disgust.

But as very few people call on nights, red and ready he was for me. I hung up again.

He called the third time, I did not sign up for this and he should never call again. It wasn’t right of me to do as we’re supposed to be so compassionate and polite to customers, but I couldn’t handle it. 

**TV channel**

And this company also answers the phones for a TV channel.
I’m not going to name any instant

**Back to the information center;**

A man called and he was looking for a woman
I did not find Jane Johnson on Street Lane 12 and he got a little annoyed, tried to tell him that people control their registration themselves. He started shouting asked if their son was registered, but Teenager Johnson wasn’t and then he shouted something about if Street Lane even existed. And then he hung up(Street Lane doesn’t, but the street he was really wondering about does.)

* Burying residents on their grounds

* All workers in this industry were blood-suckers.  I

* All subsidised care centres were part of a national conspiracy to fleece residents of all they were worth (was this before or after they were buried I wonder)

* Tax money had been diverted to fund this conspiracy

When we run through it manually

We get through the manual watering fine. Everything was working fine. So we check the programming on his timer. That's fine too. He insists on programming it to come on in a minute to see what happens. That is also fine.

He can't tell me anything other than it sometimes won't shut off station 1. He doesn't know what the timer says when it is doing that. He doesn't know anything else.

I give him a few possibilities as to what it could be and tell him to watch it and take note of what it shows on the display if the problem happens again. I thought that was the end of it.

It wasn't.

He insists that I tell him what is wrong with his timer.

I work for an answering service, and am the only operator at this location from 11p-7a.  I have almost 7 years experience working for another answering service, but they shut down at the end of May.  I've been with this company a little over a month.  I'm still learning the clients, and anyone who has done any kind of experience with Answering Services knows that each client has its own special quirks.  Also, this particular evening, I have not slept well, and didn't have time to eat before work

This particular caller had been evicted from his apartment earlier that afternoon.  There was a note on the account that reflected such.

Of course, and when I mention that he's been evicted, he says he's gotten it all straightened out, and it's just that his key fob is just broken.  I'm skeptical, but I call the on call person just to be sure.  They corroberate that he has been evicted.  They, of course, won't speak with him, in fact

Cue a lot of screaming and cursing

I understand that he's upset, I advise him as such.  I even call management again to see if they'll talk to him.  They say no, and are understandably peeved to be called.  I speak to the caller again, and tell him I've now called management twice, they've said no, they won't let him in, both times. 

Suddenly

Thirty seconds later

""Can I speak to (Manager) or (secretary)?""  It's after midnight at this point.  I tell him no

Later turns out to be every thirty seconds for the next hour and 45 minutes.  Same thing, preventing me from eating my dinner, and moreover, he's just pissing me off.

Now, or hung up on him.  However, this new job is really strict about hold times, call abadons (calls that go unanswered, or are less than 5 seconds long), *and* ring times.  We're closely moinitored by our local manager, and by coorporate, I was getting ready to just contact the police.  I mean

I decided before I did that, I wasn't sure if she thought I should call the cops, or continue to allow him to fuck up our call stats by placing him on penalty hold, or if I should try management again.  In retrospect, I probably should have just placed him on penalty hold, but between being frustrated and worried about my numbers (we just had a meeting about our numbers as a whole and our monitors, etc)

My boss told me to put her on hold and answer the call that was coming in.  I thought it would be Mr. Eviction

Really?  *NOW* you want to talk to him?  I place him on hold as well. A few seconds later, or whatever.  I don't know if they let him in, or told him to go to hell.  I am assuming they let him in.  You'll see why below.

I go back to my boss and tell her what happened.  I know she is probably ready to smack me

Mr. Eviction called back about an hour later and apologized for calling ""about a million times.""  I know I should have said ""Thanks

At least he apologized, which is what irritates me the most.

Now, and hopefully it gets approved. If additional information is needed, the screen instructs you to pick up the phone which rings to one of us at the desk. 

Of course, or listening, we get some real characters. Either people have just picked up the phone without doing the initial steps, or they think it is a payphone and want to order pizza, or you get people like the guy I will now tell you about.

1354151622.0,13yt88,Some of the best customers I've ever had.,jhunt0,15,5,2,"As I've stated in my past posts I worked for a rather large Australian airline handling frequent flyer points.

Though there are a lot of negative stories and bloody funny ones too I thought I might post about some of the great customers that I had while working there.  I should note that I haven't worked for this company for about 3 years so the fact that I can remember them makes them pretty special.

Story 1
One of the first amazing customers I had was for a couple who where waiting in LAX for their flight back to SYD.   Long story short they had  complimentary access pass to use the departure lounge but it was being refused by the lounge staff.  After speaking to the customers Dad and then ringing the customer on his mobile I'd worked out that the club was at fault.  I told the customer to head back to the club and I would have it sorted.  

So I rang the lounge at LAX spoke to the person and got it sorted.  (Turns out it wasn't the fault of the lounge staff or the customer some one forgot to send them an email about this offer.)  So anyway everything was sorted and I went back to answering calls.  About a week later I came in one morning and there was an email from the customer thanking me for the service that I provided them.  I know it sounds silly but I was really touched that they took the time to thank me and send me that email.

Story 2.

I had been promoted to Premier by this point.  (Premier means the customer who fly so much that they have earned status.  Some of these members where known for spending well over 100

This lady calls in and told me of her airline nightmare

Well she finally got to Zurich two days late and a day into her conference.  So once she had told me her story I did my best to console her and had the horrible task of telling her that because it was a partner airline she would have to talk to them.  Unlike most customers she was cool with this.  So we moved onto her points and status.  Due to all the delays etc none of her points or status credits had gone onto the system and because of all the flight changes they where getting refused by the other airline.  Anyway she gets of the phone with my extension number and I promised her I would get it sorted.  Anyway a couple of emails to a friend at the other airline and after talking with my manager the problem got sorted and I gave her a call back to let her know that the points where on and she was now a Platinum member. (That's as high as you can go).  Understandably she was happy and thanked me etc etc.  Anyway I was happy I could help but got back to my job.  About 2 or 3 days later my TL came over and wanted to speak to me.  Turns out this lady had called my TL my Manager and emailed the Customer relations department of the airline to tell them how wonderful I'd been.

So their possibly my too best memories.  What have customers done for you that have shocked you or just made your day a little or a lot better.

TL;DR Customers who made my day.

Edit.  Yes I know my spelling and grammar aren't that good.

We received all kinds of greatforthissub calls, but this one stuck out to me the most, and had my (imo) best response. 

When our phone beeped, may I have your account # please'. After receiving said account #, we HAD TO ask them their name and to verify the social security number on the account. We could take the last 4 of the social, but were trained to try to get the whole thing as the highest level of security. Mind you the account takes a little bit to load, so I am generally staring at a loading screen when they verify. So I get the beep, get the account number, ask the name, ask for the social.

At **business** it was possible to be on the radio

For the **company** we would dispatch a tow truck to someone with need. All they had to do was call in for Road Service. The customer pays annually for this, $15.00 to unlock a car door (which typically we called a locksmith for instead of a tow truck), $12.50 for a jump start.... you get the idea.

**My day from hell**

Don't get me wrong, I was fresh out of HS and making more money than my friends. I worked Holidays, but double time and a half is some nice money when you're making what I was. I also got **fantastic** perks from just working for the company. Tickets to Universal, tickets to any number of dinner theaters, tickets to Busch Gardens, you get the idea. This was either 1998-1999.

One day my bosses supervisor came over to me and told me about a call that was going to require *special handling*. 

Oh Boy..

She explains to me that one of our customers is calling to have his car towed to the junk yard. The special circumstances came in to play when he detailed what was wrong with the car. His wife had comitted suicide in the car.

**A WEEK PRIOR.... IN FLORIDA

The manager calmly explained to me that none of this data was to go out on the airwaves (since you never knew who was listening) so I had to get on the air and ask my drivers to call me on the landline. The mans wife had shot herself in the head while sitting in the passenger seat of the car. CSI and local police had done everything that they needed to with the car

*Company* had to pay the driver $50 extra to handle the job

Our policy at the time regarding RWD was we needed a flatbed in order to not damage the car. There are/were tow-trucks that could only pickup the front end of a car, etc.

Once he got to the scene

Keep in mind

In the end we got it towed

If your average customer is an idiot. Than your average banker was dropped on their head once for every year of their life and is also an idiot. 


This particular tale does not do justice to the ineptitude of most of the bankers that I have the pleasure of speaking to 40 hours a week. Nevertheless it is one of my biggest peeves with these people. 


Conversations go like this:

""Where do I get the customer to sign?""
*""The customer is going to sign line B.""*
""OK the customer is going to sign line B?""....""Are you sure?""

Don't freaking ask me twice! I just answered your question. And don't ask if I'm sure. You're the one that doesn't know!


Another example.

""Hi I have a customer coming into the branch at 5pm and I was just wondering how long this process is going to take?""
*""The process usually takes about 20-30 minutes.""*
""OK


I've obviously made my descriptions vague but you should get the idea. 
To combat this speech style I've developed the silent treatment. 
When a banker repeats the answer back to me with an obvious question mark behind it. 

They get **Silence** until they get the message. 


If a banker repeats the information back to me by rearranging the words and than putting a question mark behind their redundancy.
