This recipe is for a normal Japanese-style curry

Here's my translation: feel free to correct me if you think I did something wrong!

""I managed to make a normal curry without using a curry  mix!  I didn't use any meat or soup mix but it's still plenty thick and delicious.  Use whatever vegetables you want.  It's very easy to make.  Please try this recipe for normal curry that you can finish in 15 minutes!

Ingredients (for one-person serving)
-Whatever veggies you want: All together about 2 cups
-Salt: 1/4 tsp
-Olive Oil: 1 tsp
-Wheat Flour: 1 tbsp

(Seasoning)
--Ketchup: 1 tbsp
--Oyster Sauce (or some vegan substitute): 1 tbsp
--Curry powder: 1/2 tbsp
--Sesame puree (Tahini): 1/2 tbsp

-Rice


1)
Cut whatever vegetables you want to use into large bite-size pieces

2)
Cover and heat, add the flour and get a coating of it on everything.

3)
Add 1 cup of water and bring to a boil on high heat, but only about 5 cups even fit in the pot, and I thought it was totally fine.  Just add enough to get your veggies mostly under water.)
When the vegetables have been cooked enough to get soft, and then make any desired seasoning adjustments and you're done.  Serve over rice and enjoy.""

Happy cooking!  I'd be interested to know if you try it and have any extra pointers.  I thought it was pretty good when I made it; it nails the Japanese curry taste and texture really well.",self,t5_2rncq,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/JapaneseFood/comments/ebncz/hey_rjfood_i_translated_a_vegetarian_japanese/

**EDIT:  Update - We made Tsukune!**

Since we had a good idea of what went into Tsukune

Very rough measurements resulted in a recipe like this:

* 2 lbs ground chicken
* 1 cup panko
* 5 shiitake mushrooms (stems removed)
* 1 egg
* Chopped scallions
* 1 tsp sea salt
* 1 tsp ground black pepper
* 2 tsp grated ginger
* 2 tsp garlic powder
* 2 tsp honey
* Canola oil for cooking
-Mix well and roll into balls or small patties

For the tare sauce:

* 1 ½ tsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp mirin
* 1 tsp sake
-Glaze tsukune with tare as cooking and once again after cooking

Years ago, whose name I've long since forgotten, and the phantom flavours of half-remembered dishes dance around my tongue and fill me with longing for a taste of the distant past.

While I do miss the chewy noodles and the savoury broth and the buttery pork, キャベチャ, a simple side dish of chopped cabbage tossed with bits of chyashu and a drizzle of sauce. The kyabecha I ate there was satisfyingly crunchy, exceedingly salty, and umami as hell - an extra-special treat whenever I was lucky enough to chance upon it's rotation on the menu.

Years later, for I've been watching Alton Brown's cabbage episode and deep-seated cravings - long dormant - have been unleashed.

Asadachi, it means strange things. The word ""asadachi"" itself is actually slang for ""morning wood.""

The items in this shop are supposed to give the eater increased sexual energy. I don't know how strong the links are
When my friends and I arrived at the shop, was completely full. However, it appeared there was a narrow staircase to a second floor, so I asked if we could go up there. I led the way and squeezed past the Japanese customers on the first floor. As I realized what the second floor looked like, I couldn't help laughing. The walls were covered in pictures of horses having sex. There were bottles of homemade snake liquor on the floor all around us. At that point, I knew this was going to be a special night.

The original goal was to order the frog course as Andrew Zimmern had done on his show. In that course, a frog stew, and its beating heart. However, frogs are in season from May to October and we were there in March.

Not to be defeated, but the pork flavor was still present and kept this from being the most revolting dish.

Our second and third weird dishes were horse sashimi and whale sashimi, which is the sperm sack of a fish (in this case, cod). It was also served raw. It was slimy, kind of milky, and a bit fishy. One of the worst things I've eaten, but damn exquisite compared to hakarl.

1315334797.0,k6oeb,Far East meets Wild west - Chilli Sushi!,Murrian,11,4,7,"I guess this is the most appropriate sub-reddit

I made what has to be the best Sushi I've ever eaten at the weekend

Although I've put far east and wild west above this chilli has a distinct mediterranean style to it.

I started off boiling some Camargue rice in a vegetable stock with a couple of torn bay leaves

For the chilli I had to do two batches

I started off frying some diced red onion in a wok with a little balsamic vinegar instead of oil (for both flavour and healthier)

Let them cook a little before adding some tomato's - I cheated and used a pre-diced tomato pack, added a tin of mixed beans in chilli sauce, another thin of mixed pulses in water (drained) and four large cloves of garlic (crushed in my trusty garlic press). Torn sundried tomatos, a couple of hefty teaspoons of red pesto and a generous dash of soy sauce and a good splosh of red wine. Some diced taragon and then some broken dark chocolate (90% coco). And a chilli mix packet - try as I may I've never been able to get the flavour right mixing my own spices, plus this is way easier.

The base ready I let simmer whilst in another wok I stir fried a sliced chorizo ring (about 1cm cuts) - when it was sealed I poured half the chilli base into the chorizo pan adding some king prawns to the meat pan and green lentils to the veg option.

Once the chilli's had thickened up and were done I let them cool. As I wanted them to go well for the party I got my friend who was staying to do the rolling as she's much more experienced than I. She filled the nori as normal

I left them to cool and congeal a bit before cutting the rolls

Folk at the party were a little sceptical to start with but they went down well and the few I tried were lovely (but then most things with chorizo in are aren't they).

I'd not heard of chilli sushi before but I thought it'd work well (and I love chilli)

I have a question though that's been bugging me. Everytime I get hands on some Japanese food

First he asked me if that was soy sauce and I said that no it was not. Then he continued that sukiyaki should be eaten with sukiyaki sauce and every japanese can tell the difference just by looking (even though the ones running this restaurant actually looked like she was japanese)

Finishing of his reply he said that japanese food probably ought not be eaten outside of Japan as it might give one the wrong idea. This kind of attitude

I know we don't usually get into political conversations here but I am doing an up coming story for The North American Post and as fellow Japanese food lovers I wanted your take on the issue of whaling. 

So what do you think? Do the Japanese have a right to whaling because of their culture? Do you think they are abusing their privileges of whaling? Do you think organizations like  Sea Shepherds

Have you ever had whale? If presented with whale would you eat it? 
I would like clear honest opinions. Please though no rants. Include a little background about yourself if you think that would help. But by no means do you have to. 

Just please take note I am doing this as part of research for an upcoming article in The North American Post so you could be quoted. If you wish not to be quoted directly please let me know.
