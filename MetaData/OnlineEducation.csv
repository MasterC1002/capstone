When the sub was started

We're not there anymore.

The sub was started with the intent to follow what would later become Coursera. As you might have noticed, MITx's announced release timeframe approaching, the rapid expansion of Khan Academy, and the general maturation of university-sponsored interactive online learning all in the last few months, I think this is a good time to more formally decide our purpose.

At minimum, like the Bengali library I just threw into the fiery pits of spam hell? What about resources like [aiqus](http://www.aiqus.com) that help facilitate classes without any sort of official association?

All thoughts and discussion are appreciated!

&gt;Thank you for your interest in AI Class and congratulations to those who successfully graduated. We were totally amazed that over 23

&gt; Due to popular demand, so you can develop and test software. Our goal is to teach you to program a self-driving car in 7 weeks. This is a topic very close to my heart, and I am eager to share it with you. (This class builds on the concepts in ai-class, but ai-class is NOT required).

&gt; We are also launching an introduction to programming class

&gt; We are doing this with a new university: Udacity. In the next months

**About the Course**

&gt;Fantasy is a key term both in psychology and in the art and artifice of humanity. The things we make, serve, and often shape our needs and desires. We see this everywhere from fairy tale to kiddie lit to myth; from ""Cinderella"" to Alice in Wonderland to Superman; from building a fort as a child to building ideal, planned cities as whole societies. Fantasy in ways both entertaining and practical serves our persistent needs and desires and illuminates the human mind. Fantasy expresses itself in many ways, from the comfort we feel in the godlike powers of a fairy godmother to the seductive unease we feel confronting Dracula. From a practical viewpoint, of all the fictional forms that fantasy takes, science fiction, is the most important in our modern world because it is the only kind that explicitly recognizes the profound ways in which science and technology
