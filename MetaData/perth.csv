1366689253.0,1cwxjk,I am an Aboriginal person AMA,TheUniversalAcid,724,144,941,"Hey guys. I lived in Perth for a majority of my life

I am writing this as a matter of interest to this subreddit in regards to many threads that have been posted over the previous few months. Most people here seem to talk as if there are no Aboriginal people who are on Reddit and I just wanted to clear the air.

I will take time to answer my questions and I will be back and forth here over the next few days at least.

Edit: Awesome. I just got my first few tough questions. I will answer them in time.

Edit: I need to clarify that I use terms 'Aboriginal' and 'Australian' as a means of explaining things. I am not implying that Aboriginal people are not now Australians and shouldn't seek to live together for a better future. I am fairly patriotic myself.

Perth is epic. I've lived in Melbourne, argh, it's so pretty out here. I love Mounts Bay Drive, I love the simplicity of the city even though there's heaps more people around since the mining boom. I love the fact that no matter what, the next suburb is only 20 minutes away. (Sorry Rockingham, but I still love your beaches). I love the rains, I love the summer. I love that no matter what, people come up to me and say ' What the hell are you still doing here mate'. I love that people wish me whenever I'm on a morning running or an evening run.

Perth has it's share of local street legends known for their crazy behaviour. Who is your local crazy

Here are a few I've known...
 
First off the classics that everybody is familiar with.

[Mad Dog Adrian](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7CwzubudE0) Just about everone in Perth's got a story about this character riding around on his pushy and yelling at cars/pedestrians. 

Edit: [Even Nic Naitanui's a Mad Dog fan!](http://statigr.am/p/390365588557836096_36590426) Check the tee!

[Crazy Aussie Flag Bike Lady](http://images.watoday.com.au/2013/01/10/3944122/crazy-bike.jpg?rand=1357814909295) You know she's startled you with an ""AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE!"".

Then the hidden gems...

Piney. This little Noongar bloke used to pretend he was driving a car all the time. He'd make the noises, everything! He also liked to ask your name and write it in his pretend notepad.

Vic Park Kookaburra Man. Couldn't find a picture of this funny little bloke. He would sidle up to people quietly and submissively, and then once he had your attention he would unleash an incredibly loud Kookaburra laugh that made you drop your damn groceries in shock. I once saw him get chucked out of Cash Converters for doing it.

Tightpants McGee aka Alex aka The Strider. An extremely skinny man who wore the tightest of skintight black jeans with a big white dress shirt tucked in and handcuffs clipped to his belt loops. In summer he had the same uniform but with tight shorts. I once heard him yell at a Coles checkout chick that he had AIDS.  

Tell me about your local street legends. Bonus points if you know any actual facts about them.

[HORSE MASKS](http://www.mcphee.com/creepyhorsemask/images/horselounge.jpg) ARE OPTIONAL


**LUNCH AT 1PM:**

BBQ at King's Park! We will meet at 1PM and have a BBQ at around 1:30PM:

 * Sausage on a roll: $2

 * Sausage on bread: $2

 * Steak sandwhich: $2

 * Soft drink: $1



It's hard to guess how many people will show up. I will be aiming at catering for about 30. So if tons more show up it will be first in

Feel free to bring your own food and drinks of course (no alcohol in the public park please).

The BBQ will be in the [Pines area

Once the BBQ is over we will pack up and those attending the scavenger hunt can head to the start location nearby.



**[SCAVENGER HUNT](http://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/valhg/scavenger_hunt_is_on_with_a_prehunt_picnic_quick/) at 2:45**:

Legoyman's scavenger hunt starts at 2:45 at Fraser Ave in King's Park. Please RSVP /u/Legoyman if you would like to attend. 

It should go for a couple of hours

**EVENING AT 7PM**:

OK so I have secured us the *UPSTAIRS VERANDAH* at [Rigby's Bar](http://www.rigbysbar.com.au/). Rigby's is located at:

221 St Georges Terrace Perth WA 6000

And we have an entire downstairs bar to ourselves. There will be signs saying ""REDDIT MEETUP"" because upstairs there is a ""Dirty Dick's"" dinner show? Whatever that is.. But signs will be pointing to the basement where our meet up. DON'T BE TEMPTED BY THE DIRTY DICKS.

There will be a **limited menu** of food available. I.e. light snack meals I think.

The whole day should be epic and I hope everyone will attend. I did put down $200 for the function hire so donations of alcohol will be very appreciated :)

Update: Don't forget to bring chairs and or blankets to lunch in case there is limited or no seating available

Yesterday morning I experienced something horrible on a Transperth Cat bus on my way to work

[I posted my story in TwoXChromosomes yesterday]
(http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/195rhy/im_not_sure_what_just_happened_on_the_bus_but_i/)  and I've pasted it below to save time. 



&gt;I hope this doesn't sound stupid but I feel very confused/angry/stupid right now.


&gt;I got on the bus, but I didn't really think anything of it.
It's only a short bus ride but a few minutes into it I felt his leg against mine, he stood up and was behind me. He then started getting very close to me and when the bus bumped, his body (including his crotch) would bump against mine and he would hold it against me, and his hands would subtly brush against me when he went to grab the things to hold on to (I can't think of what they're called, but the things you hold on to on buses lol). When his crotch pressed against me I could 100% feel he was ""aroused"". To be honest, it reminded me of those pr0n videos with the girl on the bus and the guy keeps bumping her and then they get it on.


&gt;Luckily the bus came to a stop and enough people got off that there was finally enough room for movement, and this guy actually was being creepy and if he followed me when I got off I'd either have to fight him or ask someone to walk with me (and possibly look like an idiot?). Thankfully when I got off he just stared at me and didn't follow.


I'm completely aware that I should have done something at the time

Anyway

Thanks all

EDIT: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone for your comments. I really am taking it all on board in case there is a next time. It's something I never expected to happen before 7am on a Monday morning but I guess it just goes to show that creeps can appear at any time.",self,t5_2r78m,1361859131.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/198huk/warning_to_ladies_and_possibly_men_who_use_public/

1CCA-085 fake cops license plate.

The events:

* at kenwick link train station heading to spencer rd (2 lanes into 1).  
* I in right lane
* I pass the guy as he is driving slowly.  
* Just as I pass him he speeds up and starts swerving wildly at my car.  
* The swerving repeats 2 more times for a total of 3 times pushing me into the far right lane into oncoming traffic. 
* Braking let him get ahead so I can get to safety and then he suddenly slams his brakes.  
* He is in front of me as Im driving home and I see him on spencer road waiting at the lights
* He tells me
* I tell him
* He promptly replies ""I AM A COP"".  
* to which I say

Traffic police are helpful but after 3 visits to the cannington police station this morning to finally get to speak to a policeperson to make my report Im told that unless he had lights or flashed a badge its ok for him to say he is a police officer and I have no recourse. This is counter to what I was told and does not match up with the pdf's I have read of wikipedias definition of impersonating a police officer.  
I realize that should we end up in court
So I can see that perhaps the policewoman was just trying to save me wasting my time in court and she is likely right to do so. 

 So in summary:

* if you know the 50 year old owner of this car he is a dangerous idiot that thinks endangering himself
* He impersonates a police officer
* Im getting a dash cam !!!! fuck this shit.  
* Please dont take the law into your own hands
* Be careful driving out there
* Slow down

The site is: http://www.nightlifer.com.au/ - there is nothing there at the moment though! The app when it releases shortly afterwards will be free (at this stage - there may be a premium one later on).

When: 8pm on Saturday night

Where: The Moon and Sixpence in the CBD. We've had a couple of meet ups here and they've gone really well.



Why?: Come and meet other Redditors
we had at The Moon we had about 45 people and it was great. Check out some great [pics](http://imgur.com/a/2giPi#0) from it.

The website for The Moon and Sixpence is [here](http://www.moonandsixpence.com.au/) *warning: website has bad music*

Dinner: If you would like to come and have some dinner

So

Edit: I forgot to print up a ""REDDIT MEETUP"" sign but it will be really easy to find the group. Just go into the Moon and Sixpence and head around the first bar and to the bar at the rear.

The area was always in dispute between the DEC who own the car park and Subiaco Council who own the reserve. Because of the ongoing issues

In this break over Christmas an agreement has been sought and the ranger has advised that there will be daily checks and fines handed out. There will be parking officers on site as students arrive

Thought I would give everyone a heads up

You can not buy membership at Royal Perth Yacht Club just to park in their grounds

Mounts bay sailing club request a donation to their rescue boat fund but they are also about to start and put up gates like Royal Perth yacht club. You will most likely have to pay to become a member there as well. 

Sorry. No free parking on Hackett drive anymore.

In addition

**Hutton Street on ramp**

The overnight closures are required to install temporary traffic management barriers on the median side of the freeway. These barriers will allow the Public Transport Authority (PTA) to safely complete service relocation works between Powis Street and the Britannia Road footbridge (opposite Lake Monger).

There will be no reduction in the number of traffic lanes once the barrier is in place

The service relocation works are being undertaken by the PTA on behalf of Main Roads. Once complete

The vital project will add an extra lane on the freeway

Detours will be in place and motorists are advised to seek alternative routes.

* 4tb Media Server
* A Cat!
* Xbox 360, Nintendo 64 and a SNES!
* A Hammock and Fire Pit!
* A constant supply of bacon
* Internet with a 1TB limit!
* Game of Thrones

How much does this cost you say? For a low low price of $230 a fortnight you can live in this pristine abode that's close to Carousel (euck)

Other bills you ask? $35 a month for internet

We're pretty close to public transport if you're a bum like me.

Interested? FUCK YEAH YOU ARE. We're a pretty tight knit house and people that blend with our personalities would be fucking *AWESOME.*

I want to make /r/Perth  a better bigger place?
I have made some chat rooms for us to hang out in
Let’s get to know each other :-)


After the success of my recent post about “Perth Reddit mate’s rates” and things we can do for each other and random skills we have


So basically I want to get to know you all

I think we can make  /r/Perth  a bigger better place

I have made a chat-room for us Perth Redditors to hang out in... as an experiment

You don’t have to sign up

Check out the chat-room

 * use http://www.chatzy.com/PerthChat for desktop  and 

or

 * http://www.chatzy.com/m/PerthChat  - for mobile / iphone version 

 
-   Click link and  open in a web browser - 

bookmark  in you browser or smart phone now..  should be mobile compatible.  ..   we can chat as a group and PM each other …  its an experiment


To help publicise it I made this pdf for trying to get us more members

Eventually we can all hold hands together on the beach

What do you think?
Here’s the pdf..  print it out and go stick it somewhere 

http://www.filedropper.com/redditperth_1

•	If you want to be a moderator in one of the chat rooms let me know

•	if you can design a better flyer go for it

•	If you have ideas for other chat rooms I can make some.


Look forward to speaking to you all..

Its difficult to write

I thought it would be interesting to meet a few reddit peeps

I seriously can not get over how much fun that was. I thought it would be at least a little bit awkward. I was wrong. You all rock. 

Please post photos on the twitter or some other intertube so we can all view them. Anything but Facebook. 

So

**What do you guys think?** Paintball

I personally think we should do at least one more pub meet - just so we can try and draw a few more ppl in. If we have a bigger group it will be easier to book paintball/cart/lazer activities without worrying about ppl not showing. 

Also I just like drinking

I'll cross post this to /r/Australia in the hope we can catch more WA people not subscribed to /r/Perth. 

Thanks again to everyone for making the effort to rock up - it really was awesome. 

edit: special thanks to puddlejumper for inadvertently providing us with about 30 free shots. That was a nice kickstarter. It also made me feel less guilty for assuming that the table with the wheelchair lady and the dwarf with no arms was the reddit group.

1299941418.0,g2ll1,Why do so many of you hate Perth?,gbhall,28,6,66,"This is based on my observations over the past year. 

I've recently moved to Perth from Auckland

First of all
* ""Perth is boring."" I think people here only say this, and has never visited Scarborough Beach. At my uni, Curtin, it seems like 50%+ of the students I've spoken to have only been to Scarborough Beach or Hilary's a few times in their life. Wtf.

* ""Perth has the worst public transport in the world."" This is normally when I want to pull out a baseball bat, you never have to look up scheduled times, because it's every few minutes. The train system is amazing. People say Melbourne's transport is amazing, but having visited many times, it's really not. SMARTRIDERS are the best as well!

* ""Perth is backwards."" How? Perth is such a **clean**, I never use Eftpos anymore :( Meaning, I can't keep track of my transactions.

* ADVERTISING. People here are the worst. People that live elsewhere exaggerate how awesome their city is. People in Perth however, but it's almost a bad thing to love this city. Before moving here, I had never even heard of Perth. Yet I knew of Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. Perth needs to stop being so submissive, and be more aggressive in showing the world who it is.

* Weather. Perth wins. ITS LIKE SUMMER ALL ALL YEAR

* BEACHES. Sydney boasts about how popular it's Bondi Beach is. It's only so popular because it's conveniently located next to the biggest CBD in Australia. Perth however

* PEOPLE. People here are not like the rest of Australia. Actually people here are unusual for such a large city. Never have I experienced and more open, SMOKING HOT. Perth has to have the most attractive girls in Australia. All along the coast, especially along West Coast Drive by Hillary's, there are an unlimited amount walking everywhere.

* FITNESS. Related to people above, or swimming. It's just unreal at how active and healthy everybody keeps. 

In conclusion, one of the best lifestyles to experience, one of the best places to be in the entire world.",,False,self,t5_2r78m,,http://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/g2ll1/why_do_so_many_of_you_hate_perth/

There were 16 of us (out of 36 seats to a cinema) and the staff proceeded to take all the orders for food/drinks and THEN associate them to seats.

There is no self-service option for water - just Coke

They did not announce that the trailer/movie had started, how hard it is for a employee to at least point us to the right ones?

Also

The hot chocolate I ordered was barely a shot worth - probably 3/4 of the glass was froth. I can't comment on value for money on my $8.50 chips and $14.00 chicken burger - because I NEVER GOT THEM. Despite that whole ordering debacle earlier or I never received my meal - which I had skipped lunch for.

I found out later they had delivered my order - to two completely different seats without checking. What was the point in associating the orders with the seat numbers then?

I wasn't the only one who didn't get what I had requested prior to the movie.

For the record, not to mention food and drink well...it's a total joke. You would expect more for that.

Formal complaints have been lodged and phone calls will be made tomorrow. I am still so angry at how bad it was.

We saw Prometheus. The movie itself is actually quite good

The great reveal also happens now!

The event happens at everyone favourite Perth/Northbridge hangout; 1Up Microcinema!
(https://www.facebook.com/pages/1UP-Microcinema/154584244586389) (312 William Street

I've organised with the owner (Matt) to host this shindig there and allow us to have a little fun.
I will be bringing down some 360s and some HALO4 that can be played
There will be a small fee ($5 per person) payable to 1UP Microcinema for the rental of their facilities. We've tried to kept it as low as possible so to not exclude anyone because of ridiculous costs... but people gotta eat and pay rent. There will also be snacks available to purchase so if you have a tingle in your tastebud for Peanut M&amp;Ms or Junior Mints

Plan is to meetup at 1UP Microcinema at about lunch time
If anyone has any questions
I'll try to keep everyone updated as I come to learn more or decide upon further details.

It's hard getting the word out there but we're getting there. I run Barcraft events in Perth and there's one this Sunday. There are more events coming up and there will soon be a weekly event if you want to fill a Tuesday night. PM me or check the FB link for details.


If you've got Facebook


For everyone else;
The Broadway Tavern has been kind enough to open on Sunday to show the GSL Season 5 finals! Make it worth their while


* Date: Sunday 2nd December
* Venue: Broadway Tavern
* Address: 88 Broadway
* Time: 10AM
* Parking: Free

1353151075.0,13cj78,r/Perth Paintball meet up,XombiePrwn,19,2,26,"Sooo it's me again haha.


I was wondering if there are enough people interested in a Paintball meet up... hopefully there are enough people interested to make up two teams. (you can even make your own team names or logo!)
I think minimum team size should be 4 so we can have a few matches 4 vs 4 but would prefer teams of 6 -8


It will of course be held on a weekend
I'm just getting in early to see what number of people I can expect before making bookings and everything.


If I can guarantee enough people I will arrange transport to and from the paintball grounds. (I'll rent out a Van or two for the day)


The only expense you will have to cover is the standard fees for the Paintballing itself


I was thinking of this location / company for the event:http://www.wasppaintball.com.au/

Unless anyone knows of any others they prefer?


And for the alcoholics among us

I would really like to make this into a proper event

Thoughts?

First priority is figuring out where to live.  I've done some research and it looks like there are several good areas to live in.  The criteria are below:

Probably looking to spend ~$1000/wk (if we need to spend that much).  We're thinking something that will be near all the ""action"", parks, gyms, public transport, etc., but not too crazy.  I will be working downtown, and do NOT want a super long commute in the morning or evenings (no more than 30 min max).  We're in a single-family home now, flat, a view of the water (Swan River

We'll be renting...not buying.

From everything I've read, they're probably more high-demand, so I want to know from the locals what some of the better places to live may be given our criteria.

Any guidance you all could provide would be awesome

Can't wait to get over there and start the experience!

Something that has had me really frustrated on the roads since I moved to Clarkson

What is the proper etiquette for this?

I shouldn't really have to under-take them as this is dangerous and they are breaking the law

Lately I have taken to giving a quick flick of the lights

So what can we do about this problem? I don't really want to honk my horn

I have found this occurring more and more lately, even noted that he couldn't believe how many people here would sit in the right lane with miles of clear road ahead of them and a dozen cars banked up behind them.

Do we need more road signs to make it clear that it is an offense to sit in the right lane when not overtaking?  We could at least put it on those LED signs above the freeway that rarely seem to be used.

Anyway

I think I will buy one of those LED signs for my back window and get it to scroll ""get out of the right lane"" after I am in front of the perp.

After a few attempts on FB
By stable and permanent I kind of mean anyone who has put a great deal of thought into getting a pet and would be people who have been in a long term relationship (or happily single)
It was my absolute intention to have all the kittens to the vet before re-homing however I lost a job the week before Christmas and have only just started a new one. 

A bit about Schmosby; I think the name says it all.  
He's a very loving and friendly cat who gets along with everyone. He is good around other cats and although he's never met a dog, litter trained and likes to eat kitten biscuits and wet food. 
The place I get all my information about the new WA cat laws is  [Shenton Park Cat Haven website](http://www.cathaven.com.au/new-wa-cat-laws/) You will also find information about their Vet Clinic services.

If you would love the addition of Schmosby in your home

We want to make sure Schmosby will settle into a home where he will be loved always and life will be simple.
