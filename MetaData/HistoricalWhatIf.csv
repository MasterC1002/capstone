Having their army already mobilized and fighting in the North

The US, has not mobilized or prepared its forces for war. Although beefing up its naval presence, the number of troops remains pitifully small. 

1918: Mexico launches an attack, cutting off their march to San Francisco. In Texas, border towns are quickly overwhelmed, as is San Antonio. The Mexican army bypasses the capital of Austin and instead heads straight to Houston, hoping to cut off supplies arriving by sea. Texas, notorious for its independent nature, quickly rallies the militia. Houston is torn apart by brutal, hoping to burn out their enemies. 

The government in Washington is taken completely by surprise. Saboteurs cut railway lines and telegraph lines throughout the country, because Mexico's soldiers were armed with US weapons and had made counterfeit US military uniforms. Washington moved quickly to lock down remaining troops in the country, hoping to stop the spread of the non-resistant revolt. This significantly slowed their response to the invasion, allowing Mexico to solidify its gains. 

4 days after the invasion began, is arrested and hung from the White House portico. The Senate simultaneously passed a mandatory draft (Although not necessary, as recruitment offices were overwhelmed by volunteers), and declares war on Germany and the other Central powers.

Naval forces from San Francisco, San Diego. Furthermore, forces land in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, and begin fighting up the Baja Peninsula. 

In Texas

After 8 bloody days, they dig trenches and await the main force of the U.S. military. Mexico tries contacting the US government, offering peace in exchange for holding territory in Texas, California, New Mexico, and Arizona. The US government doesn't even respond. 

**2 weeks after the invasion**: Mexican forces remain in control of New Mexico, Colorado, and California. US forces have manages to retake most of Los Angeles and San Diego, although Mexican guerrillas saturate the hills around L.A. In Texas, Houston has been utterly destroyed but retaken; the Mexican Army has settled into San Antonio, awaiting a longer battle. US forces have been stopped in Baja Mexico at Santa Rosalia and have also become entrenched. The first battalions of US Regulars arrive in Texas from other states. After a devastating first assault on San Antonio, with casualty estimates as high as 25%

**1 month after the invasion**: US forces defeated outside Santa Rosalia retreat back to Cabo San Lucas; resupply and reinforcement efforts are hampered by German U-Boats, make their way into the Central Valley of CA in order to resupply from the many farms in the region. They are doggedly pursued by US forces, and employ a ""scorch and burn"" tactic, devastating the region. Minor skirmishes take place up and down the state. In Texas, Mexican forces in San Antonio show few signs of running out of supplies. The US Army brings in heavy artillery and begins non-stop blasting of the city. 

**2 Months after invasion**: Mexican forces in California are destroyed at the Battle of Fresno as they try to make their way into the mountains and join up with forces in Nevada. US Troops push through Arizona and New Mexico before being stopped at Albequerque by entrenched Mexican forces. In Texas, retaking the Rio Grande and occupying Matamoros. US Marines land at Veracruz and take the city with almost no resistance. This becomes a hub of landing more soldiers and spreading through Southern Mexico. Indigenous peoples in the Yucatan rise up against Mexico and join US forces, establishing their own independent nation on the Yucatan Peninsula. US troops from California begin pushing into the Baja region while simultaneously pushing up from Cabo San Lucas. The peninsula is taken in a matter of days and the army invests Hermosilla. 

**3 months after invasion**: San Antonio finally falls to US forces when Mexican forces run low on ammunition and attempt to break the siege and retreat toward Mexico. The government of Mexico sends envoys to the United States in order to negotiate a treaty. An angry mob, hampered by the lack of infrastructure in arid Northern Mexico. Railroad tracks are laid at a breakneck pace. Reinforcements stream into the country with no end in site. 

**4 months after invasion**: Western Mexico secedes and allies itself with the United States. Mexican forces surrender en masse as the US marches toward Mexico City. The US has recognized the independent countries of Yucatan and Oaxaca. The government of Mexico recalls all remaining forces to Mexico City to man the defenses. Washington still refuses to negotiate terms of surrender until the government has fallen. Planes come into widespread use, where a U-boat waited to take them to Germany. The President of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz, hangs himself in the presidential palace, and Mexico City is taken without a fight.

Imagine that we take roughly ten thousand people from the present day and transplant them to a primeval Earth, and the same flora and fauna (and of course there would be more of these two); the only difference being that humanity is noticeably out of the picture.  No villages



These ten thousand people (equal parts male and female) would represent the pinnacle of human knowledge in all fields; they would be engineers, nurses, chemists, physicists, biologists, geologists, craftsmen, electricians, historians, maybe thirty feet long and eight feet high



So essentially the question I’m pondering is how long it would take these people to attain a level of technology we’re accustomed to today if every THING that we take for granted was taken away from them.  No tools, and there wouldn’t have to be as much struggle or trial and error.  But would they put their nose to the grindstone and get to work?  Would they fall into some ridiculous autocracy despite the historical precedents they are sure to know about?  Would some dick try and burn all the books to prove a point?  Or would they recognize all of the faults in our present society, and use their collective wisdom to make a utopia?  Would they set up a market economy or would they try some collectivization scheme?  Or perhaps they might try one and move onto the other.  Would they skip from stone tools to steam engines?

This got me thinking - Which empire do you believe was most likely to (or even possibly could have) controlled the whole world. I know this is a seriously unlikely 'what if' so ill include a couple of basic conditions to narrow it down.

1. I don't mean every square inch of land on the planet I mean controlling the institutions of countries who had the potential to strike back. For example the British Empire would needed to have controlled countries such as France and Russia but not necessarily Madagascar

2. Take the empire at the height of its power and factor in previous territories. So

3. Be as creative as possible - I want to hear some outlandish stories. If you can make an argument for a remote tribe in Iceland I want to hear it. Extra point if you can make a convincing argument for the French! (British joke!)

To me this is a very interesting question
  
it's totally removed from history and no one ever hears of it - i think this is unlikely for a couple of reasons, and it's worth noting that a popular and peaceful protest caused this [more here](http://www.rosenstrasse-protest.de/texte/texte_stoltzfus.html) an important exert;
  
&gt;Joseph Goebbels, and rationalized that he would deport the Jews later anyway.  
  
Had they been victorious then either these Jews would be quietly forgotten about or quietly murdered
  
It's almost certain that it'd be a fairly well known event
  
So the party would have two options
  
The stated desires of the Nazi party was to return all Jews to Palestine once the British Imperialists had been kicked out - personally i think they'd certainly have done that as a great excuse to engage in a protracted war in the middle east, similar to the allied excuse for the last seventy years of middle eastern intervention) 

this would be important of course because controlling the middle east oil was very obviously going to decided who was the economic superpower of the century (in actual history america and britain do this)  
 
I think they'd try to push the line that almost nothing bad happened and what did was for the good of everyone - certainly as the nazi's wouldn't trust the Jewish state with nukes like america did, just as any peoples at peace tend to do.  
  
So which is it?  Do they try to deny it

How would this be accomplished?

A)  **Make Canada warmer:**  This is done by making the Hudson Bay deeper  and cutting off its connection with the artic ocean through the Foxe Basin.  As a result, St. Petersberg or Stockholm), is capable of hosting year round deep water shipping, ect.  The rest of Canada also becomes warmer, with the treeline going north, the northern parts of Manitoba, Ontario, Canada becomes a second Russia of sorts.  

B)  **The US controls Canada:**  As in OTL, this time, the British don't enact the Quebec act, resulting in Quebec joining the United States.  Of course, the British still control the Hudson bay but the border is disputed (I'm basing this off the Oregon Boundary Dispute) and in the 1840s there is a war which the US wins.  So it ends up controlling the (warmer and ice free) Hudson bay and the rest of Canada  (Alternatively, the US might manage to purchase the rest of Canada from the British).

Alaska however

The Hudson bay becomes an economic area similar to the Great Lakes region today only larger.  There's much more farmland and more productive land in general and more immigrants (perhaps more Chinese imigrants are let in) massively increasing the total US population. 

C)  **The Southwestern United States** is taken in a manner similar to OTL only the US decides to annex all of Mexico after the Mexican American War.

So by 1900, much more productive land and a warmer climate.

What does the world look like today?  How does US history (ex: the civil war) play out?  Does the US in this senario become too large to hold together into one country?  What do US politics look like?  How much more powerful is the US really?

I don't think this happens. The Roman Empire outgrew Rome early.

Rome just wasn't the economic center of the empire or region.

The Austrians are able to fight valiantly for months however the sheer number and never-give-up attitude of Suleiman carry the Ottomans through the day as they are able to conquer the city and bring the Hapsburg Empire to its knees.

Suleiman agrees, plead him to continue to march west. Meanwhile in France, the French government is ecstatic that the Hapsburgs have been significantly weakened and no longer threaten compete with them in the east.

Suleiman sees the world is changing and also builds a strong navy and asserts himself in a new Atlantic trade.

My thinking is that the two best opportunities to do so would've been immediately after the fall of Berlin in 1945 or immediately after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.

First, saying that the Soviets would not be our allies any longer. Whether or not Patton actually asked him that, I think considering the massive losses that the Russians had suffered and that the offensive would've started in early May meaning we wouldn't have been fighting in Russia in the winter, the Americans could have successfully taken Moscow in 1945. I know that we could never have been able to successfully annex Russia (for lack of a better term); the main point is that we would've kept there from being a massive centralized government that was diametrically opposed to America's interests. 

We also could have intervened on the side of the Nationalists in the Chinese Civil War and set up a state friendly to America. Latin America was already within America's sphere of influence, it's unlikely that any other state could've successfully developed atomic weaponry for at least a couple decades, meaning America would've had a monopoly on that superweapon and could've used it essentially with impunity. 

Over the next couple of decades I see America dominating the planet either through setting up puppet states (what would happen in China), cultural, and military dominance to the extent that some countries, while ostensibly still independent states, would be virtual vassal states of America (what would happen in Western Europe and the some of the Americas). 

As for expanding in the wake of the fall of the Soviet Union, and the economies of Europe are just as strong if not stronger than America's. In terms of military might, however, I think America could've still had a shot at setting up a puppet state in the weakened Russia and potentially moved into China as well, who still hadn't reached the heights they have today, for instance. Hopefully economic interests and unwillingness to commit to total war would've kept most other countries out of war against America.

Again, and the administrative and military costs associated with maintaining it would have been astronomical. Basically I'm asking if the scenarios described above would have been possible and viable, or if there has ever been a better scenario for America to essentially come to militarily dominate the entire world to the extent that it could be considered an empire?",,False,,t5_2si7z,,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/1dyqcy/could_an_american_empire_ever_have_been/

The only wildcard in this scenario is the USSR: Are they stronger militarily in 1946 as OTL 1941

1350666880.0,11r89r,What If HistoricalWhatIf Goes Off the Rails? Ideas for Guidelines?,RockyIV,51,9,14,"I'm not a moderator

I'm a little concerned about the trend towards narrative stories as replies that aren't based enough in actual historical probability or argument. It's like we're getting a polished novel describing one of innumerable hypothetical scenarios. It's one single line of a gargantuan decision tree

**For Example**

If someone asked ""What if Gore won the U.S. presidency in 2000?"" the replies we're seeing aren't ""I'd expect substantially more environmental legislation, with whom he had a nasty relationship in the 1990s."" 

Instead, suffers a stroke and retires. Hour 209: President Gore nominates leading law professor Richard Posner to the bench. Hour 211: While smoking a celebratory cigarette, Posner accidentally burns down the taxi stand in front of the Capitol Building. Senator Barbara Boxer thus has no shelter during a rainstorm the next day, and gets wet before an important meeting with the Chinese. She runs home to change, is late to the meeting, and they cancel a trade deal in response to this rudeness."" 

**It's Understandable that this Happens**
I realize this is in part a result of these being entertaining

**Why It Worries Me**

My worry is that with the narrative, or something that merely *could* have happened but wasn't necessarily likely, or something that was a pretty reasonable expectation. In reading a very entertaining and quite long story yesterday, I ended up completely unsure of what to believe. Maybe more meta comment would have helped (if the poster said ""This is historically possible but not overwhelmingly likely"") or had another subject-matter pro been on hand, they could have debated it a bit. 

As a kinda-sorta spin off from the r/History subreddit

**Possible Responses**

1. Nothing. Maybe the community doesn't mind if HistoricalWhatIf is more of the novella format. 
1. Ask posters and responders to add a word about how speculative they're looking for answers
1. Set some rough guidelines for commenters that say ""Try to be good about disclosing whether you're stating something many historians in the field would agree with, not citations.  
1. Insert your suggestion or derisive comment to me here.

I imagine a Pacific War in which every contested island would have been a total bloodbath (even more so than in OTL).  Battles would have put each sides warriors' to the absolute limits in terms of military honor and sacrifice.  I figure that even to the point that if one side ran out of ammunition, and felt that the warrior is one of the most noble of societal pursuits.

&gt;Anastas Mikoyan was tasked with the negotiations with Castro over the missile transfer deal designed to prevent a breakdown in the relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union. While in Havana, on his own initiative, decided that Castro and his military not be given control of weapons with an explosive force equal to 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs under any circumstances. He defused the seemingly intractable situation, which risked re-escalating the crisis, on November 22, 1962. During a tense, four-hour meeting, it would be in breach of an unpublished Soviet law (which didn't actually exist) to transfer the missiles permanently into Cuban hands and provide them with an independent nuclear deterrent. Castro was forced to give way and - much to the relief of Khrushchev and the whole Soviet government - the tactical nuclear weapons were crated and returned by sea to the Soviet Union during December 1962.

Let's set the stage.  It's 151 BC.  Carthage is an economic superpower that repaid its ""crushing reparations"" to Rome in no time at all.  They have raised an army to repel a Numidian invasion (which failed miserably, and see a rich area that is ripe for plundering.  They also have an excuse to go to war with Carthage - since Numidia was a Roman ally, they can use this ""Punic aggression"" in their favor.  We have Cato the Elder uttering the phrase ""Carthago delenda est"" at every opportunity.  Rome is making demands of Carthage at the point of a sword, trying to provoke them into declaring war.

Now, the Third Punic War never begins, and Carthage (as it existed then) is never wiped off the map.

How would this affect the landscape of the Mediterranean as we know it today?  Would Roman aggression during the period of the Empire end up becoming too much

How would the world have changed in the following decades? It seems to me that there would still have been a number of incipient crises that could have led to a war. I'll throw out some ideas for the sake of speculation. 

**The German Navy**
The Second Reich was hungry for colonial possessions and was building a fleet to match the Royal Navy. Would they have been able to surpass it, when, and what would have happened? At what point does a fleet-in-being need to become a fleet-in-doing?

**The Triple Monarchy**
It's believed (by which I mean I read it somewhere) that it Ferdinand had survived, too? 

**Russian Industry**
The German leadership was very nervous about projected Russian economic growth -- they thought that it would surpass that of Germany and Austria combined within a few decades and smother their continental hegemony in its cradle. Would they have tried to force a war before the Russians could become unstoppable? 

**Autocracy
Assuming that Nicolas outlived Alexei

**Irredentia**
The Italians would have still had their eyes on Tyrol and Trieste

**The Pashas**
The only problem with the Turkification policies in the Ottoman Empire was that Anatolia was full of minorities and no one anywhere else was Turkish. Could the Empire have held together? Would it have faced a succession of military coups? Would the Russians have started a new ""short

**Elan**
The French would never have stopped plotting to take Alsace-Lorraine back. Would they have precipitated some crisis in which the Germans seemed to be the aggressors once the Russians looked strong enough in the East?

**Japan**
The Japanese wanted a colonial empire but would have had no hope of  taking one if Europe had remained at peace. Would they have tried anyway? Otherwise

**World Socialism**
The influence of leftist ideologies like anarchism,  how would a the diffuse left-wing movements have continued to develop? Would there have been a revolution somewhere else in the world?

**The Colonies** 
The rise of national consciousness in the European colonies was probably inevitable. What would colonial regimes have looked like without the war?

**The Crash**

1. Modern day organized religion is the evolution of tribal spiritual practices mixed with a group of people wanting political and social control.

2. Religious practices are based on the need to survive

3. Somewhere along the lines, and this was passed on through the collective consciousness. This worldview beat out the reality-based worldview more than 2,000 years ago in Ancient Greece.

Ancient Greece is where the most interesting part of this Historical What-If happens. Certain philosophers like Aristotle were already developing a form of secular philosophy

**If the Roman Empire and the rest of the Western World had been shaped by these philosophers' quest to understand our reality, how would the next 2,000 years have played out?**

Sub-questions to think about:

1. Would scientific development have happened much faster?

2. How would politics and borders been impacted?

3. Would the Roman Empire have existed without Christianity
