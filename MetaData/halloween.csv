For the trick-or-treaters:

-Obviously you should walk on sidewalks when possible, facing oncoming traffic, so you can see the cars coming on your side.  Sometimes with all the yelling and talking that goes on when trick-or-treating, it's hard to hear a car coming behind you.

-Carry around a flashlight to flash at approaching cars.  So many neighborhood roads are dark

-If you want to cross a relatively high-traffic neighborhood road

-KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR KIDS.  This is obvious, that could have been a potentially dangerous situation for the kids.

For the people who will be driving:

-This is a given

-If a street is too dark and there are no cars coming towards you

-On ALL roads

That's just a few of the things I do, so if you guys have any more tips, let everyone know!
