1334920946.0,sjhes,"Everything a beginner needs to know about cannabis. Self-post, too, so please upvote.",econymous,164,38, not a doctor! Some of these may not be 100% true for all people and some facts may have been omitted. I'll fix them as they're brought to my attention. Also

Basically, and a third one that's useless called... Rudimentia or something similar. No one smokes that third one. It's not used for hemp or what-have-you either, given that it's the smallest of the three. 

Now

Sativa (as was mentioned before) gives you more of a head-high. This can be both good and bad. 

Upsides

* More energetic (not crazy hyper like coke or anything

* Much more of a ""free-your-mind"" type of high. You'll have all kinds of weird thoughts you wouldn't otherwise have.

Downsides

* PARANOIA. This is everyone's problem with sativa. When I said freeing your mind, don't waste your time thinking about that"" but with a decent head high you don't think like that. This means that every cloud will look very cool, you'll have crazy insightful thoughts, and every time you take a step you will imagine a cop or a thug is right behind you. You should note that not everyone gets paranoid, most people aren't affected like this at all. I am, though, and most people that say they don't like pot are affected in the same way.

Fun facts

* It grows much taller, this is what would be grown in Cali due to their excellent growing conditions (google the Green Triangle to see what I'm talking about).

* Additionally, this is what they would use because a taller plant can produce much more hemp using much less ground space.

Then there's Cannabis Indica

Upsides

* Much more similar to being drunk.

* No paranoia or bad feelings at all.

* Very relaxed high; you'll lay back, I don't even think time is real""

Downsides:

* You can get too tired. This isn't a ""fall asleep where you're standing"" thing, completely sober.

* The body high can kind of mess with your depth perception and make you dizzy. Someone mentioned in a different thread the feeling of falling backwards every time you sit down. This can happen, ""this happened to a friend of a friend once"") the dizziness can lead to nausea and vomiting. Again, I've never seen this.

Fun facts: Indica grows much smaller, it's grown indoors much more than sativa. However, the shorter/bushier look does not suit well for production of anything other than, well, recreational/medicinal buds. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE: It hits everyone differently. The above descriptions of the effects are as general as I could make them. **

Methods of ingestion (Ranked from most to least economical in terms of amount of weed required to get you high)

**LESS IMPORTANT NOTE:** For most of these you are going to have to grind your weed up in to small pieces. It's pretty easy

* Edibles. The basic tradeoff with edibles is that you can get much, you need a fairly large amount of weed. Baked goods like this work because THC is released through heat (HEAT not carbonization, this is important). THC will also bind with alcohol and fat, which makes ""weed tea"" a possibility. NOTE: weed tea does NOT involve pouring fat nugs into a mug of hot water and stirring. Google some recipes. One of the favored methods of ingestion via edible is called ""cannabutter"" which as it sounds is butter infused with cannabis. Tastes delicious, you can store in your fridge or spread it on anything. Oh, one more downside to edibles: They take a fairly long time to make and they smell VERY strongly while you do so.

* Vaporizers: Expensive pieces, not by flame.  The main methods are the hookah and the vaporizer. A vaporizer, or vape, is definitely the more popular, at least here on the weed-related subreddits. Specifically, most members will point you towards a portable vaporizer called the Magic Flight Launch Box, or MFLB. I don't own one and have never seen one, vaporizers are one of the healthiest ways to smoke, vaporizers work by heating up the weed

* Hookahs: Huge range of expenses. Mine was $140 and has served me very well. I've seen smaller ones go for $20, in the form of hashish. Nowadays, most hookah ENThusiasts will tell you to smoke shisha (a delicious mixture of tobacco, honey, and various flavorings) out of a hookah and never soil it with drugs. This may be the way to go if you have a really nice, expensive, classy hookah, but in a slightly different method. It's hard not to look classy as all fuck while smoking a hookah. Basically, if you're cheap, but a you're not inhaling any water. The water simply cools the vapor down and perhaps filters out some of the nastiness inherent with coals. The stem to which the bowl is attached goes down below the water line. So

I've been doing P90x before Every smoking session my friends generally joing me since I'll smoke them out before we do P90x. I'm literally getting a six pack and am getting in the best shape of my life

I've met the greatest people in my life and have a much better and healthier social life now. I don't have a girlfriend yet, I couldn't ask for better friends, I'm so appreciative.

Smoking gives me dry mouth so I bought a 1L Sigg bottle. I have gotten into the habit of drinking 3 liters of water a day

When I smoke I get bad munchies. So I stopped buying junk food and have only fresh fruits, just no junk food at home. By far one of the greatest things that's happened to me. I eat to make My body happy, I no longer eat to make ME happy.. 


I have become less selfish and more appreciative, tv etc) I'm simple and run efficiently.


I have pretty bad ADHD that doesn't allow me to focus on anything in school really. I'm not going to brag, something I've never been able to do without literally forcing myself to be encaged in the library at the last minute so I dont fail. I'm out of school this semester saving up money and getting out of debt.

I occasionally smoke with my sister and we watch great movies and play mario party and just have a great time actually getting to know my sister. Something I've never stopped to do anymore.


I feel like our normal life is this structured mess where we build and build and build, the times you find it hard to recall everything because you were just living life. Those blurry moments are the brush strokes that brings everything together and creates your masterpiece. 

For me a smoking session is when I stop walking down the busy street
and stare. Just soaking in life and all it has to offer, thats folly, I understand the emotions those words are meant for.

users probably intuitively understand what I'm talking about
that potential smokers receive concerns proper inhalation technique
the high. I will talk about the actual sensation of being high and what you can do increase your enjoyment of the experience.*


Ask a regular smoker
seems richer and rawer. Some people describe a child-like sense of wonder. You derive even more pleasure from doing the things you love. It's almost as if 
you perceive the world in higher resolution. 


*Life in HD.*


Here's what weed is to me:


A **Magnifying Glass for Awareness**.


A magnifying glass allows you to see something in very great detail. It reveals what you would otherwise overlook or be unable to perceive. It allows you to 
focus on one subject


To extend the magnifying glass metaphor
if you were to pass an anthill while walking
Maybe you would watch the amorphous
But
You would see one ant bringing a crumb five times its size back home. Or 100 ants fighting
grasshopper. After watching for a time
you are hunched over. Waste disposal, cooperation, territoriality, war, sex and the daily grind and on and on. All of this is exhibited by tiny insects 
experiencing the world by blindly probing in front of themselves with their antenna.

*The staggering complexity


Let me give you a more concrete example. You are eating a bowl of spaghetti while watching television and talking to your friend. Meanwhile your mind is 
running its own narrative
attention is constantly pulled to and fro by the many competing inner and outer signals of everyday life.


Now you are *high*; viewing life through a *magnifying glass*. The *hot* spaghetti
mouth. A whisper of basil follows a *spicy* garlic note. Saltiness
relationship. You move the magnifying glass. Troy and Abed are building a pillow fort. You remember *childhood* memories of building forts with your 
siblings. This recollection is interrupted by the soundtrack of a commercial whose *melody* entrances you. your *friend* gets the punchline of a joke a few seconds after it's 
delivered and starts laughing. You *laugh* as well and together your laughter builds its own infectious momentum. Your subjective experience continues like this 
for the duration of your high


Once again


weed is a **Magnifying glass for Awareness**.


Whatever you point your mind at is revealed in greater depth and detail. Allowing you to derive greater enjoyment and meaning from it. It can be a physical 
sensation like touch or taste. It can be sight or sound. Perhaps you are focusing on an emotion


*How can you apply this magnifying glass concept?* Here are some


**SIMPLE GUIDELINES** *for first-timers (these are not rules. As you become more comfortable with being high or want to push your limits
guidelines):*


* **1) Don't multi-task**


Looking at several different things through a magnifying glass is difficult. You have to keep switching back and forth between subjects. When you're high
try doing one thing at a time
are doing several things at once


Sometimes it's better to do what you're doing alone or quietly. Social interaction can become another ""task"" that overwhelms you


* **2) Start simple


Some things demand more mental resources than others. Eating a burger requires less thought than cooking that burger. You have to form and grill the patty
slice tomatoes and lettuce and Caramelize Onions. One requires you to divide your attention between multiple actions while juggling several thoughts and 
timings. Simple activities or thoughts will allow you to focus your attention rather than those which involve many sub-components. 


Social interaction is also more complex than we give it credit for. You must take in a complex array of information involving body language
cultural practices
high.


* **3) Be aware of (mind)set and setting**


People usually advise this when talking about more powerful psychedelic drugs like LSD or Magic mushrooms
using weed. 


Your current mindset and setting will affect how well you can control your awareness and where it wanders. If you are stressed out
turn your attention there and amplify those feelings. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Weed can help you work through difficult emotions and problems 
because you are able to think more deeply about them. Plus


In the same way
paths for your awareness to travel than a crowded party with friends and strangers. Each of these trips will have a different ""flavour."" Be aware of this. 
Preparation really helps in this area. Know when and where you want to be. Smoke when you know you will be in the mental space you're looking for. Prepare 
your meals and activities so that you're not focused on getting everything together during your high. Of course
own flavour


* **4) Learn to control your awareness**


The bottom line is that you should learn to direct your attention. you should be able to move from one area of intense
you want. Or focus deeply on one thing for a period of time. If something is bothering you
consume your focus.
 

**COMMON PROBLEMS** *experienced by first timers:*


*""Am I high?""*


*""Nothing's happening. I feel the same.""*


*""Things feel different but normal


*""I'm freaking out!""*


If you find yourself dwelling on whether you are high or not
possibly dangerous. Your expectations and anxiety are foremost in your mind. Guide your attention elswhere. Forget about having smoked and enjoy the music 
that's playing or take a bite of that chocolate bar and enjoy the taste. If you like dancing
really enjoy nature. Take a hike.


Things that involve consuming, or participating. 
Focusing on the physical and tangible is generally easier than focusing inwardly on thoughts and emotions. These are not hard rules and there is a lot of 
overlap of course.


If you feel as if you are freaking out then you may be experiencing sensory overload. Refer to the above guidelines. It's also possible that you are 
confronting some issues that you weren't even aware of when sober. Now is a good time to seek solitude or comfortable company and ride it out or work it out.",self,t5_2rukl,1357947772.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/xnf8b/whats_so_good_about_being_high_a_guide_for/

I want to take this opportunity to remind people that the internet is not as safe, and Reddit, with it's millions of users from all around the world, is absolutely no exception. You do not know who you are talking to, and what intentions they have.  
  
The reasons these posts aren't allowed isn't just so we can play big brother. Most of you are adults and can fend for yourselves, is because it simply attracts negative attention. Saplings is intended as a sort of safe internet haven where we can innocently learn about cannabis culture. If this Reddit (or any other for that matter) becomes an online black market and a place to get a quick hookup, it will easily attract the attention of people we do not want. Just like Facebook can be used as incriminating evidence, so too can Reddit, and I assure you, the Reddit team will *not* protect you. They are running a reputable business and will not be held liable for any illegal activities going on on their website.  
  
The bottom line is that it is simply not safe. We want absolutely none of it on Saplings
  
For those of you who are genuinely curious in learning *how* to obtain trees in your area
1) Find local stoner hangouts in your city. Parks, what have you. Stoners are all around you, you just have to look for them, and ask.  
2) Order a pizza and ask the delivery guy.  
3) Ask friends
  
We need your cooperation in keeping Saplings a safe community. Do *not* give out personal information. Do *not* try to obtain trees via the internet.

Oh yeah: This is written from the perspective of someone who grew up in a non-medicinal state. The stakes(and what you should do) are different if you're in Cali.

**Not Getting Busted in the First Place**

* **Never break 2 laws at a time**. Or as it was put to me: ""*You never get arrested for having weed in your trunk

* **Do not store your weed in the same place you store your driver's license

* **If you have weed on you, ask permission before you dig anything out of the car.

* **If you get pulled over, don't make any movements that would be clear from your silhouette. Also be aware that they're probably going to do a quick glance behind/under the drivers seat without making you get out of the car. This means dropping it next to/under the seat can be a bad idea. 

* **If you're going to smoke in public

* **If you live in a medicinal state and travel out of state

* **Cars are stupid places to smoke. Parked cars are even more stupid.** If you're driving:Cops and citizens are a lot less sympathetic when they think you are endangering others. If you're parked: Your lighter might as well be a road flare at night.

* If you live by water

* **No matter how used to it you get

**When The Police Show Up and Know You're Carrying**

* If you're running, you're done.

* **Do not consent to a search** - They will find it if you do. They're good at their job. There is a much lower chance they'll be able to get a dog to search your car.

* **Do not ever fucking carry bags or scales on you outside your home** - It's a one way ticket to ""intent to distribute"".

* **One cop is better than 2 cops** - If the cop is going to cut you slack

* If you have to toss your weed, they actually look for it.

* **Keep in mind that throwing it is a calculated risk**: They need *something* to search your person(in theory)


* **Don't be a dick**

**Fuck

* **If you're under 18

* **Lawyer up** - There's a plethora of possibilities(like the ones mentioned above) that you don't even know how to ask for. You will get destroyed if you don't do this.

* **Clean your Facebook up** - Limit what will show up in the news feed about you (random inebriated tagging has been the downfall of more than one ent)

* **Start Saving Money** - Probation is damn expensive. Think ~$80/m just to be on it, random court costs.

* **Shut the fuck up to the police**

* **Going to Court? Get a hair cut

* **Once there is paperwork done or radio traffic about the incident

* **Places drug test differently.** ""Monthly"" tests don't all happen the same way. Some places it means everyday you have a 1 in 30 chance. Some places it means you get tested once a month. Obey the conditions of your probation

* **""Diluted"" drug tests generally just mean ' your piss is clear'** - Vitamin B will clear that up. Red bulls have a huge percentage of Vitamin B and will turn your otherwise water filled piss yellowish green in no time. Diluted drug tests are seen by many probation officers to be just as bad as dirty.

* **There is a difference between a lab drug test and a home drug test** - Home tests(which are also used by many drug testing programs) barely work at all. 2-10 days if you're skinny[don't test your luck]. Lab tests can go up to 30 days.

* **Violating Probation is serious business** - They will not be nice to you. They think they *have* to be harsh to send a message you're not getting. Don't give them this chance.

* **If you're in a ""serious business court"" (especially if you're a minor) get your ass to outpatient rehab** - They're going to probably put you there anyways

The number one problem with a lot of these threads being made is that the poster is being socially awkward. Neither myself, or just because smoking is the only thing you two have in common, but because you’re both chill ents. 90% of the “dealers” you will encounter just want to smoke for free and buy enough to part out to close friends. Someone who is dealing with harder drugs, or pills, is a gang-banger, or doesn’t like you for whatever reason has WAY MORE excuses to rip you off at some point. **Grow some balls, and go outside.** 

Here are some tips:

- You should ALWAYS start looking for a new dealer before your stash runs out. Otherwise you’re gonna be in a Wendy’s parking lot at 9pm waiting for a friend of a friend to come through. George Carlin was right on when he said that when two guys are sitting alone somewhere in a parked car

- Once again

- [Cops **can** legally lie to you, make sure they inhale). The laws regarding police conduct may be different where you live compared to where I live, I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. If you are paranoid about a police encounter check [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqMjMPlXzdA) out, or get a copy of one of Barry Cooper's DVDs. 

I might be wrong in saying that undercover police cannot use drugs. [Opn420 linked to a page on Erowid which cites 21 U.S.C. § 885(d) of the U.S. Code](http://www.erowid.org/freedom/police/police_info6.shtml) as saying ""Police officers working undercover have exceptions from certain criminal laws. For instance, sales or use of illegal substances."" On the other hand, [here is an article by former Texas police officer Barry cooper where he states that undercover cops were NEVER allowed to partake in illegal drugs on or off the job.](http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/node/18941) 

I am sure there are three things we can all agree on concerning this: (1) the chances of being busted buying a baggie of weed are slim

- Use your fucking head! Don’t front a stranger money. Make sure you have a friend with you before wandering down any dark alleyways. If you live in a dangerous place consider only bringing enough money for whatever you’re going to buy (I tend to always do this as a general rule of thumb). 

- Put yourself in the other person’s shoes. At what point would you be ok hooking up that person in the mirror?

- Dealer etiquette varies from person to person. If you are thinking about posting a dealer etiquette thread consider just asking your dealer in person next time. That way you both know what to expect. If they’re your dealer

- If you are going to smoke with your dealer


There are some Internet resources you should check out. Going to Webehigh is a good first move. It might tell you where you can procure bud in your city, which I would recommend as a last resort for marijuana. If you don’t get scammed, your package could be intercepted or stolen. An ounce of high grade weed is bulky, and REEKS compared to some LSD blotter. 

Although I have never tried it, answer the door with an unpacked bowl and see if they notice, be creative! [Make sure to use your best judgment to safeguard yourself from assholes.](http://www.wtsp.com/news/article/213849/58/Pizza-delivery-guy-calls-cops-on-customer-who-smoked-marijuana) Something else that has brought up is working in a kitchen as a dishwasher. I guess the idea here is that if your every day routine isn't getting you what you want, you need to break out of it and find some novelty/dank nugs. 

Universities and colleges are good places too. If a nearby school has a SSDP, get to know everyone, and ask once some people step out for a cigarette or bowl. Even if your local Uni is an hour away, you should be checking these places out if you’re in high-school anyways!! Towny highschool students would hang out with us all the time and it was totally chill. There is usually a place on campus where stoners go to smoke; probably hills and fields where students chill on in the weekend. They are a cool place to relax with a book or frisbee. I should also mention that a lot of my stoner friends hang out or work in coffee shops, where it’s probably more acceptable to strike up conversations than other places (bonus points if you bring a Jack Herrer or Terrence Mckenna book with you). 

I would say it is likely that any 18 to 20 year old that smokes cigarettes is going to smoke bud. If you are a smoker too, and only works for a percentage of attempts. Anyone buying cigars (blunts) or Zigzags at a gas station is probably a toker. But would you follow up with anyone you met at a gas station? 

Take a walk around the parks. They are a great place to hang out in general. Go for a walk and see if you catch a wiff of bud. Dusk or night time would work the best because young people tend to stay up late. Once again

[Demographic factors are something you want to consider when approaching someone.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique#Demographic_factors) Please note that I am **NOT** telling you to stick to your own race, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender are things you should take into consideration. Don't hang out at a high school trying to pick up bud if you're a forty year old dude. tha_snazzle suggests asking any young white person with dreadlocks. I have had friends (both male and female) who had dreadlocks, and they were constantly jokingly asked about weed by strangers. However, I have a male German flatmate with dreadlocks, and if he does smoke

My last piece of advice is avoid false positives. When I ran cross-country in high-school, and literally ran away. We thought that he might of went to go get some authority figure but he came back saying he wanted to get away from ""the drugs"". He was wearing a Phish t-shirt.

1309006426.0,i8vo9,So your family just discovered your trees! What now?,TubbyandthePoo-Bah,91,10,12,"Dear Saplings

It's come to my attention that many of you are getting caught with trees. Understandably you're upset and believe the use of trees is a personal decision

**Disclaimer: if your family are understanding

Let's start this off simply - your family loves you, siblings, or spouses may enjoy making your life a living hell. I'm fortunate enough not to have suffered your plight, honestly I don't understand it, and I would suggest contacing a support charity relevant to your ordeal. Do it now, your life doesn't need to suck.


**The basic premise:** 

Your family disagrees with your decision for thier own reasons


To be able to navigate your problem in a mature and sensible manner, strategic, and determined to this course of action for this to work.


**Understand the initial encounter:**

You got caught. Either your shit has disappeared, confused, and truthful. You want to be working to give this impression from now until everyone forgets about it. If you just get pulled in for 'the talk' then you've been caught off guard, and you don't have the advantage of free confession. This is how most of us find out about the impending shit storm.


You're scared of how all this is going to pan out


Instead of being shocked and angry you need to empathise with what your family are feeling about your herb use. They think it's a gateway drug and next thing you'll be shooting heroin into your genitalia. They don't understand that herb is not a gateway drug. Really they could have any number of notions.


You need to understand they are terrified for your safety


**Strategy for 'the talk':**

Understand that you're working with irrational fear! The **only** path to a win state here is to nullify that fear. You need to think from their point of view


They want you to understand that you're wrong, unless you want to be hearing about this bullshit for years. 


It's massively important that you walk out of the talk with them thoroughly believing that weed is a VERY BAD THING! That you know it


**Show penitence:**

Until they trust you they're going to keep fucking hassling you. Don't get drawn in by this shit. What's happening is they're working out their own frustrations. You need to adhere to the notion of penitence from the moment you got caught until people shut the fuck up about it.


You need to be consistent. If you make out that you think trees are good then you're just making your life difficult for yourself. You can be bitchy, but your argument must always be that you think weed is stinking shit that corrupts youth. Ask counter questions referring to why they don't trust you. You don't always have to suck it up, but remember... drugs are bad 'mmmkay.

**Something to think about:**

Maybe trees aren't for you right now, occasionally smoked at 18, and became a heavy smoker at about 25. I tried every drug available to me in the two weeks after my 21st birthday, and basically didn't like them.

Take things in your own time.


**Get smart:**

Now your problems are just about over, you're compartmentalising your life, being sensible, and exercising sensible levels of caution. AKA being mature.


* Rule 1 - Don't shit where you eat. Don't have a sly toke in your room like some dumb kid, eventually, and probably a hell of a lot faster than you think. Any change in your behaviour at home is going to arouse suspicion -Why are your windows always open? - Have you started using more deodorant? - Why does the closet smell of febreeze?


* Rule 2 - Don't be stupid, walk down the street, or leave evidence of trees on some boozy campout. Don't become overcome by paranoia, but don't be that idiot that thinks they're invulnerable. That's how idiots end up in jail. If you are caught be respectful and deny all knowledge. For fucks sake don't ever talk yourself into police custody, don't chuck your weed out a car window, throw that shit down your neck and keep quiet.

* Rule 3 - If you're out in the wild don't get completely blazed, preferably whilst walking. In the same vein never take too much weed to a party, or in a car, because you'll never know if you'll need to toss it or eat it.

* Rule 4 - Don't appear to be a stoner. Never go home fucked, unless you're asked and then either garnish the truth or tell an outright lie. If you tell an outright lie it must be one that cannot be proved or disproved, saying you're going to X's house when you don't actually go over is dumb. Don't answer your phone stoned. Say you were driving, or better convince people you only talk via text or instant message.


* Rule 5 - Never take weed home


* Rule 5a - If you MUST take weed home, then it's easy to accidentally discover. If you really want to chance it, you think you've got everyone fooled and you're going to keep your shit close, buy a lockbox. Tell everyone you're buying a lockbox to keep your savings, stamp collection, precious porn cutouts from the '70's in. Remember though, that shit is easy to break into. A lockbox is a good idea if you intend to stash stuff at a friends house


* Rule 420 - Enjoy your herb, but please don't try to prove it. If you end up homeless, or what the fuck ever, you'll soon learn the limits of a great friendship.

**In the Smoke Shop**

-Do NOT mention cannabis in any way shape or form even in you are in a medical state

-Do NOT call them bongs

-Be careful when bringing in a piece with marijuana residue. In some shops this is okay

-Be smart. 

**How To Pick Out a Bong**

1. Determine your price range. Bongs can range from as little as $10 to thousands of dollars. It's important to determine your price range to find the best product. 

2. Straight shot, like bubbles, are a combination of both beaker and straight shot. I suggest straight shot as it clears the fastest. 

3. Artistry, but not at the price of quality. Too often I see saplings buying cheap, but beautiful looking pieces only to have them break very, very easily. Please be careful when purchasing an ornate piece. You can always get a unique bowl or different downstem or stickers to personalize your piece. 

4. Features. Nowadays it isn't uncommon to find a nice solid straight shooter with an ice pinch and a diffused downstem for about $60 or less. Look for bongs and head shops that know the latest technologies for pieces. Search yelp and other reviewing sites for the best head shops. Do some research. 

5. Durability. Durability is a very important factor when choosing a bong. You don't want to have it shatter if it gets a little banged up. I'd suggest a bong with a 5mm glass thickness. This is not very hard to find. You will thank me because it also gives you milkier

6. Haggle. Often times you can haggle with the head shop employees **respectfully**. Don't try and lower a price on a unique

7. Buy a bong bag. I can't tell you how many times I've seen downstems or bowls broken in the back of a buddy's car wrapped in an old t-shirt. Get a bong bag. The headshops will often cut you a deal if you buy it with your bong. It's worth it. 

Good luck with your bong purchasing ventures. Feel free to PM me with any questions.

Have you ever got really high? Of course you have! Have you got really, the room's spinning the moment you close your eyes and you can't quite get it to stop if you open them again?


If you've encountered all the horrible panic


We'll do this in steps, which prevent me reaching an [8] - the level where you can feel your whole body.


**Step 1 - eliminate tobacco**

Those of you in the UK who toke spliffs mix your herbs with tobacco. Tobacco


The additives increase the hit of the tobacco and the trees, and the wasteful nature of smoking a tobacco joint. Remember, you're burning more tobacco than ganja, and most of the mixture is being exhaled. Unless you're baking in a car or a shed or some other school kid hijinks the efficiency of the method is too low.


I'm not saying don't smoke tobacco while you're getting toasted, then don't smoke tobacco unless you want to calm down and level out. If you think the walls are looking at you funny then it's probably time for a cigarette!


**Step 2 - increase efficiency and get really stoned**

When you've got the baccy out of your herb it's your time to shine


The easiest way to get extremely high is the American puff puff pass method, extreme levels of blazedness may be reached.


Eating is probably the most efficient way of getting wrecked, this temperature is considered low in cooking terms. The reason you always see space cakes and hash brownies are because they're yummy foods that are baked at a low temperature. If you cook read up and be careful, otherwise you're just wasting trees. You gotta save the rainforest my dear!


Pipes, bongs, buckets, waterfalls, hotknifes, and other such pure burning methods are the next best thing to cooking, and it's the next best thing to one draw pass with a room of your favourite ents. Smoke it up like I know you always do. Exhale, it doesn't really matter. All these tools get you hellastoned and are a matter of preference. 


**Step 3 - meet the panic barrier**

You need to keep getting high until the room starts spinning, panic attacks (palpatations, unusual feelings in your chest and arms), whatever it is that freaks you out and stops you getting past [7] - what I call the panic barrier. 


When you hit the panic barrier you're as high as you want to be at the moment


The key to this, unless someone drops a bale of it on your head, these feelings are your brain freaking out. In my case, all these sensations were linked to my physical well being. Places built up with stress and aches. Our brain blocks out continuous sounds, it also blocks out discomfort from stiff muscles and other little aches.


When you go past [7] you start to feel your body


When I hit the barrier, panic, or a thumping chest attacked me I tried to stay calm and concentrate on relaxing. The room's not spinning (although I can feel it doing so), I'm not dying (although I feel like I'm having a hear attack), nothing bad is going to happen. Relax.


**Step 4 -  relax

After the initial panic attack you still have to shake off the residue of doubt. Rationally you know nothing bad is going to happen, but the crossover at [7] messes all this up.  Or that's my pet theory anyway. To get past this I started off with some stretches, paying particular attention to the joy of shaking off my limbs afterwards. Move about, wriggle, act as loose and daft as you can handle. Do whatever it is people do to release muscle strain, the key is to not think about it too much. Shrug off all that stress and doubt.


**Step 5 - break through [7] and keep on going**

To get up to a real [8] you need to prepare gradually. At its crux an [8] is like a shortcut to being able to meditate. By meditate I don't mean sitting half lotus 'omming', and empty their mind of all the crap rattling about in it. We ents just short-cut that preparation by being massively stoned.


We do however need to follow some of the principles of meditation, I wish I could do yoga...


The poses just let you relax your body properly, but some people find they just nod off to sleep then they do that, thus the talk of poses. The pose is important because the sacred herb can get us high enough to feel our entire body we still need to make sense and order of that wash of sensation.


**Step 6 - be your own master**

More than that I can't really say


The way I did that was gradually. I'd get completely blitzed and lie flat out on my back with the room spinning. Then to stop the spinning I'd try to understand the sensation. That led me to all kinds of tense muscles. One by one I learned to relax them and internally mapped each one, but ones you forgot about, don't use, can't feel, whatever. 


When I say feel I don't mean poke your fingers into yourself. Use your central nervous system. Feel and relax each muscle in turn. I normally try to relax one tense muscle, and you'll probably be a bit surprised. This is the short cut to meditation I was talking about. It's funny because it's pretty easy to do when you're [7]. Try it when you're [0]. It gave me great respect for people that can clear their mind and feel every muscle in their body simultaneously, without having so much as a bite of spacecake.


Slowly you'll start to get a better feeling and understanding of this strange quasi meditation thing and you'll be able to snap right through the panic barrier and into the calm meditative state you need to hit a good solid [8].


So that's how I learned to love the bong


Happy tokes all. Thanks for the positive vibes!

3. Make sure when you get a stash box it isn't too suspicious. Keep something very common in your room that no one will touch

4. When smoking with people

5. Don't spray too much cologne

6. NEVER carry your stash box with you

7. Make sure you have cough drops

8. Never allow other people to ""hold"" your weed

9. Always listen to the elder ENTS unless It seems ridiculous and you know it's not right. They are always willing to help

10. The most important one is DO NOT be afraid to ask
questions! ENTS help ENTS! Do not be shy

11. When buying your first piece, or glass bowl.

**Do bongs get you higher?**

  Sort of.   I'm going to use an alcohol analogy here; bongs are like hard liquor.   Do you get 'more drunk' from hard liquor?  In a strictly technical sense, wine, liquor, moonshine.. they'll all get you drunk if you have enough.

  The reason I said 'sort of' is because just like a well mixed drink with a lot of alcohol in it (Long Island Iced Tea, etc..) a bong allows you to take in a large amount of cannabis in a very short period of time.   *However*, just like hard liquor, this can be risky and result in a very messy situation.  

  I like hard liquor, scotch, tequila.. things like that.  I enjoy the flavor and like to savor it slowly, taking little sips over a long period of time.   Does this get me drunk as hell?  No... I actually drink slower than if I was drinking beer or something else.  I could (and did in my younger stupid days) pound back shot after shot or guzzle straight from the bottle, but that's a waste of good liquor.  Sure, it hits you hard at first and knocks you on your ass, but the end of the evening usually leaves you with the room spinning and a lovely evening talking to a toilet
 

  The same logic applies to bongs.   You *can* load up a huge bowl in a triple perc glass RooR and clear the entire thing in one massive hit and go back for more, you feel 'higher' and great for a bit, but unless you're careful, the evening is going to end with you passing out or being uncomfortably high and unable to do anything by lie down in a quiet spot while waiting for the chaos to stop. 

  If you want to smoke from a bong or drink hard liquor responsibly and have a better time, but pack smaller bowls and slow down between hits.    **A bong *can* be a way to get massive amounts of THC into your system quickly, but it can also be a way to take much smoother hits that allow you to enjoy the subtle flavors and aromas of really good cannabis.**    

  Leave the massive bong rips and chugging contests to the 'bros' and fraternity kids.   Take the more mature approach

**TL;DR?  With bongs and booze

Also, then be a GGG and make sure they make it home safe.   If you are drinking or smoking, don't mock the sober guy/gal.  They're your lifeline and can save your ass in any number of situations.

1365049879.0,1bn3pa,Complete Stoner Stealth Guide,PileOfTrees,58,8,9,"So I've posted this in the past

First off

1. Never brag. - This means, about your smoking. The more people know, the more likely you are to get caught.

2. Don't be stupid. Be patient. - If it's risky

3. Don't get overcomfortable. - No matter how safe you think you are

4. Scent is a very large indicator for smoking. - Smell is very important. Here are a few ways to reduce smell.
 
 * [Sploofs](http://i.imgur.com/3hsBD.jpg) are very helpful ways to reduce the smell. All it is
 
 * [The Smoke Buddy](http://www.amazon.com/Smoke-Buddy-Personal-Filter-Purifier/dp/B00478UIB2) is also a helpful alternative
 
 * [Incense](http://i.imgur.com/ZsNWT.jpg) are also *very* helpful for masking the scent. Just introduce your room/home to them so they can become common
 
 * The ""[Bathroom Method](http://i.imgur.com/ZxaDe.jpg)"" is one of the most flawless ways to smoke. Start up a nice, open it, and if not, it isn't a big deal. Put a wet towel under the door of the bathroom, closing off the escape route for smoke. Blow your hits into a sploof preferably, which is also better if you aim it at the air vent or window. 
 
 * Vaporizers are VERY useful

 * Spraying with FeBreeze, or using something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Ona-ON10061-Pro-Gel-Quart/dp/B002JLGMEG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337743546&amp;sr=8-1) will be very helpful for masking the smell.

 * To keep the smoke in a room

 * Even with a sploof, or continue to smoke. I always hav ea water bottle cap nearby, to put on my bowl to stop the smoke. A coin also works with this.

5. Smoking outside is good. - When you can, and you can enjoy the outdoors. 

6. Closets are good spots

7. Fans are life-savers. - Fans are one of the most effective ways of removing the smell. Open a window

8. Windows should be open. - Windows are the only way for the smoke to escape your room, this may just blow smoke further into your home.

9. One of the most important things is eye drops. They cost less than $4 at your local store (Walmart, as your eyes can become ""addicted"" to them, which isn't fun.

These are all my tips for toking stealthily

EDIT: I'll add user suggestions here:

* Don't let that towel stick out too far

* Wash yo' smelly hands. The smell sticks to your hands.

* Wash yo' smelly mouth. Gum or mouthwash works well.

* Make a super safe sploof by poking holes in the bottom of a water bottle and stuffing it full of scented dryer sheets. I've heard stories from people who used TP rolls and it didn't work out so well...

* Microwaving popcorn is a great way to make an overpowering smell to cover up other ones

* Cover your bowl with your thumb

* [Hogwash](http://www.amazon.com/Hog-Wash-Organic-Hogwash-1oz/dp/B0036QOV4Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365093137&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=hogwash+1+oz) is a good spray to help remove the smell of weed.

* Roast some coffee. The smell will help mask it, coffee!

* People swear by [Ozium](http://www.amazon.com/OZIUM-SANITIZER-OZM-1-ORIGINAL-SCENT/dp/B000CSWCAG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365093079&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ozium). It is said to remove almost all smell,,False,self,t5_2rukl,1365208157.0,,True

These are a list of ideas i am pitching to the mods to consider.

1. Lay down the law and stick to your guns. That first joint you rolled of yours is nice but /r/trees is the place for that. If people post things like that just give them a warning and remove the post.

2. Update the sticky list. I see a questions about if firecrackers smell every other day is seems like.

3. Recruit active mods. Take a week to study the active users of the subreddit. If you see there active see if they are interested in mod. We only need a few considering how this subreddit only gets 5 new posts a day.

 Scientific papers are the best source for info, but I've known many Ents with high level degrees, dated a PhD chemist for 5 years, my brother is a brilliant geneticist doing post doc work, and his partner has a Masters in molecular biology.. I've learned to read and interpret scientific papers just to keep up with dinner conversations..:)  



A note for Ents and saplings that can read this sort of stuff:  This is a layman's translation of a scientific paper.  I'm sure I've made a few errors and it's certainly not properly cited

Conspiracy theories and 'Big Pharma' rants are also not welcome.

The paper:[Harm Reduction Associated with Inhalation and Oral Administration of Cannabis and THC - Franco Grotenhermen](http://www.cannabis-med.org/data/pdf/2001-03-04-8.pdf)

My summary: *my interpretations and conclusions are in italic*

- Inhaling any sort of smoke is bad for your lungs.

- Use materials with a high THC content allows you to reduce the total amount smoked.

- Edibles are safest and provide longer lasting effects

- When smoking, and last 2-3 hours.  Certain effects last longer.   Muscle/body effects can last more than 12 hours.

- When inhaled normally

- Absorption is slow and erratic with edibles.  Effects start between 30 and 90 minutes in


- Absorption of edibles in the stomach is a complex thing.  Preparations with high oil or fat content are likely to be more effective.

- Decarboxylation through heating is required to activate THC into a usable form in the body.   5 minutes at 210 degrees Celsius (410 degrees Fahrenheit) is optimal for complete decarboxylation without oxidation to cannabinol. Note that this assumes you're consuming that product without any additional heat. (ie: cannacaps)  *If you'll be baking your cannabis afterwards

- For medicinal use for MS or glaucoma

- For migraines or pain relief

- Cannabis smoke contains over 200 combustion compounds

- Tobacco smoke and cannabis smoke are fairly similar.   Several PAH's are 25-75% higher in cannabis tar

- Holding your breath 4X longer results in a 40% increase in tars.  It's not clear if this means 4 times the damage

- Chronic smokers tend to develop chronic bronchitis and eventually COPD, but current users didn't.  *Very strange and an area that needs more research badly.*  

- Holding in smoke may increase THC absorption

- Average THC concentration is USA cannabis was 4.2% in 1997.  and 10-20% in 2001.   Higher is better for smokers since they use less and decrease the overall volume of smoke inhaled.

- One puff from a 10% THC joint provides about 5mg of THC.  Daily doses of between 2.5 and 20mg have proven effective in treating nausea and vomiting in HIV/AIDS patients. With tolerance


Best practices:

- Use highest the THC level possible

- Use a pipe.  Tars condense on the sidewalls

- Bongs are worse than joints for cutting down tars.

- Avoid moldy

- Of all smoking methods, but it will also reduce cannabinoids, so it's not worth it. 

- Vaporizers studied heated up to 185c without producing any toxic components.  Toxic stuff begins to show up at around 200c.  Combustion happens at 230c.  THC is available at temps as low as 140c.

- Holding your breath beyond 10 seconds does nothing but increase tar concentrations.  Plasma concentration doubles between 0 and 10 seconds.   *Around 5-7 is probably the sweet spot. Holding in is more effective for more potent pot than for schwag or ditchweed.*

- 'Cough to get off' is a bad idea that can lead to spontaneous lung collapse


- For those who have taken too much

- For medical patients who can't smoke or even keep down edibles (stomach cancer, but the preparation of the compounds is beyond most consumers and only possible in labs or pharmacies.  *Sublingual dosing through tincture is probably achievable at home, but your mouth is gonna burn like hell.*

One of them bought 2.5 grams for only $30 while we were there. Which under any circumstance is awesome! But, dude, I'm gonna make a gram bowl. You down?"" Of course I'm always down! But his idea of a ""gram"" bowl is to literally put the nugs in the bowl without breaking/grinding them up first. I wanted to tell them right then and there that what he was doing was extremely wasteful and not the way to do it. But, since it's his weed I only made little hints on it. Didn't want to insult him or anything. 

When he loaded the next bowl

So

* First
* A) Grinding will conserve more weed. If you just stick the nug in the bowl and light it
* B) Grinding makes it much easier to corner hit. If you don't know what a corner hit is, and you don't instantly torch it.
* C) KEEEEEEIIIIIFFFFF!!! Grinders are great because a lot of them have keif catchers. Which also means that you get more bang for your buck!


* Also
* A) There's little to no THC in the stems. If you happen to get a good strain with very crystally stems, make a keif bowl.
* B) For me, if it has THC in it it'll get you high. But it's not a good high, and ultimately, not worth it.

So that's my two cents. I hope this helps!

tl;dr don't smoke stems and always grind.

I got home about 5:30PM
He asked me if I was coming out to chill, but this past weekend I smoke some both Saturday &amp; Sunday and has a pretty fun weekend.

So, because my friend owed him some money. He said he had some 'chronic' shit back at his place, so we left and went to his house.

He's pretty cool

When we got to his house, I can't remember what he said he weighed the bag at, but it was alright.

We decided to chill at his house for a while, and after I passed the joint I knew I was stoned as shit. After a few minutes, I was higher than I've been for quite some time, I could feel it all over my body.

I could feel myself going white as a sheet, if that makes sense.

We went back inside and the guy knew I was was pretty bad. I could feel myself sweating a lot. I took my coat of my he told me to sit down. He got me a nice drink, that his girlfriend made, and it has the nicest icing I've ever had on it!.

As I was sat down, and it landed on it's legs and it started bleeding or whatever they do.
I just couldn't contain myself and was laughing pretty hard. He was saying loads of stuff

Can't really remember what happened but my brother was on his way to chill aswell. I think my friend was in the Kitchen rolling another joint

The guy unlocked his car, there was a women and some children looking for a rabbit. We stopped smoking until they left. 

I ended up going back inside on the couch high as fuck. Loads of other fun stuff happened and he told some pretty cool stories. After I while

My borther and friend were going somewhere

I got home, just as she came downstairs. I got quite scared, as I was still high as fuck, and probably stunk of weed, since I'd just been smoking, had some in my pocket, and my hands were covered in tiny bits of bud (from splitting the weed, until I just took my coat of and went upstairs.

I'm 30 years old, to be honest.  I want to share with you how I came to eat my words about this topic and have become and enthusiastic sapling.

Long story short, considering having to leave my job because of it, and friggin miserable. I was told I was going to have to start low-dose chemotherapy, and I would be on it indefinitely.  I was in soo much pain and so super sick that I had trouble walking and couldn't sleep. 

At my husband's urging, and have done so every chemo day since then.  It seriously was the only time I was not in pain, not stressed, not nauseous, and could finally sleep more than 3 hours at time.  

I just finished the chemo, and am now at the point where I just enjoy it.

**FIRST SMOKE**

We agreed to meet at his place at 7:30 and I would buy pizza instead of pitching cash for bud. Not long after arriving

After about 5-10 minutes, which I managed ok with some coordination issues. Pizza showed up and we chowed down.

In all truth

**SECOND SMOKE**

At 9pm, the one hitter was packed, then dipped in the kief from the grinder. The first try wasn't packed right. The second one was spot on and I got a good hit or two in.

We migrated back upstairs to the couch and sat there talking. As I was sitting there, like it was catching up with itself. ""It's like slow time and fast time at the same time"", as I eloquently explained. I found myself holding a bottle of cold water to my lips, sipping away the whole time, just being lost in the amazing feeling of the cool water going down.

My friend was grinning at me like an idiot

I realized I had to take a leak and got up to go to the bathroom. I stumble to the bathroom and after what feels like forever, washed up, and left. It felt like I was in there forever! I'm told I was only there for 2 minutes.

He brings popcorn in for snacks. I barely notice and am fading in and out of this feeling that feels like my body is awake while my mind is drifting in and out of sleep with all the hypnagogic imagery. I remember he told me to eat some popcorn. I leaned forward, forgot about that, reached in to grab popcorn, forgot I'd done that too, then brought it towards myself, forgot that, wondered why the fuck I'm holding popcorn

I left for home (with the wife driving) at around 11:30pm and was just starting to come down a bit. The car ride was a bit intense and I eventually made it home. A nice

1353536075.0,13l84c,Stealth Smoking for Young Ents (x-post from r/trees),Philosophicaltree,49,8,8,"Hey guys

1) Where/how do I hide my weed and paraphernalia? -Smell proof containers for both. I keep my stuff in a large tin can - I put it in a baggie, which I wad up and put in the can as well. -I keep my stuff in my closet, but don't use any single hiding place for too long. It's also a good idea to keep your herb and your receptacle for herb enjoyment separate - my rationale is, if your piece is discovered, you can act shocked that they uncovered that antique from your junior-year reefer smokin' days.

2) How get them to not suspect anything? -At the end of the day, and are respectful and help around the house, then it probably won't matter if they even do suspect anything, because you'll be showing them that you're in control of it, and it's not impacting your life in a negative way. Gradually, it'll become less and less a matter of solely keeping it a secret, but also setting up a means of defense and rationale in the event that they become suspicious

3) Should I use joints, or a vaporizer? -NO JOINTS. Joints and blunts both constantly burn, making stealth-toking that much more difficult to hide. The smell will permeate any area, even when you're outside. Plus, it's more wasteful. -Pipes and vaporizers are a lot better for stealth smoking - they're smaller, easier to handle, and they conserve a LOT more herb. Whereas with j's or blunts, with pipes or vapes,"" then they can bring their own

4) I used to use a sploof, and then funnel that in. Again, it’s a fantastic odor absorber. -Add another layer of wet wipes/paper towels. -This will be your best fucking friend. It takes five minutes to make, but it can be the difference between secrecy and a hell of an awkward explanation for why your room smells of herb. My sploof is my best friend. Use it.

5) How do I smoke at home undetected? -If you want to smoke in your room, open them all - but be sure to open the top AND the bottom panes. This will allow for easier air flow - warm air goes out, cold air comes in. -Get a fan. Point it towards the TOP opening of a window. When actually smoking, put it up closer to the window, pointing outside, and exhale from the sploof into the back of the fan. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A SPLOOF, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TOKE IN YOUR ROOM. I'm serious. And it had better be my super-sploof design. -When smoking, cover the bowl with your hand or a handy coin nearby. This will prevent smoke from escaping out the bowl - and also conserve your herb! If it keeps burning, the space that your supplies were occupying, which is a neat little tool you can use to prevent the smell from leaking. If flows OUT

6) And now the most important question: Is it worth it? (The risk of getting caught) Well, but remember: The better you get at stealth smoking, the more easily and frequently you'll be able to do it. Take care to not let it become a problem. My suggestion? Buy small. Going just a gram at a time is a good basis for organizing your smoking routine. Whether you're only buying on a friday and smoking through the weekend, or managing that gram to last you through the week, either way, you're not smoking a whole lot, and it's easier to keep it in check. However, you'll have to buy more on account of smoking more frequently, and how important their trust is to you. I know for myself that as fun as having a secret life is (trust me, keep it a secret. You will encounter situations where you need to either lie or fess up

Edit: From texts he's sent me:
From Texts:
“If you have pets, congrats! You have a masking smell... and a patsy to throw under the bus if anyone mentions a smell. 2) If you have dogs, get them used to the smell. They won’t act all interested if they detect it on ya. Also, my dogs now appreciate herb-smell with me being in a playful, happy mood...which brings me to 3) Play with them when you’re high. So much fun.”

“Use pieces of charcoal to absorb odor. Baking soda also works wonders. Eye drops are a great investment, friendly body language, but don’t overdo it. You’re trying to minimize suspicion—not invite it. CLEAN THINGS. It’s fun AND rewarding.”

“Lastly for now: Remember that you are putting some responsibility on yourself to keep your space clean. Do your part as a member of the household, assess the situation and determine how much your parents probably know to be true. Just because you’re getting in trouble doesn’t mean you can’t do some damage control. Half-truths are better than whole lies. Use your productivity. Be mature, reasonable, and non-confrontational.”",,False,self,1353565198.0,t3_13l84c

I am very happy to be able to bring you this adventure

I was excited to be at the 30th anniversary of the fabled 1967 Summer Of Love, and I certainly had no inkling of my future self as Old Hippie.

I wrote most of this up the same night it happened (except the last paragraph), but it was password-protected to keep it out of the prying eyes of search engines (they had those too!). So only my closest friends — less than a dozen people — have ever read this before today.

After I started writing as Old Hippie, although I knew I had saved it. Finally, I discovered it in a ZIPped archive that I had made last century, and knew I had to share it with you. Today.

Notes:

* My sons were 3 and 8 at the time.
* I’ve left everything exactly as it was in the 1997 original, which made it very hard to read. However, [I have preserved that background here for posterity](http://askoldhippie.com/).
* I know you’ll want the recipe. I haven’t tried it yet
* My biggest surprise was that the Summer Of Love website is still up and running and looking great!

Nugs and hugs forever

Bullet points are in order.

1. Strong happy feeling. I wish it stayed at this phase

2. Everything moves slower. This part is very fun. I turn my head and everything drags a little behind what I'm looking at.

3. Random thoughts. I like this part because it's hilarious. I make myself laugh and laugh. This lasts throughout the rest of the high.

4. Body starts to vibrate. I close my eyes and lay down but I see shapes and lines forming into things. It freaks me the fuck out.

5. Body is shaking. Full body vibrations occurring about every 10 seconds. About every 30 seconds it feels like I'm sober for about 5 seconds, but I still couldn't remain calm because I honestly thought I was dying.

6. I laid in bed for about 2 hours motionless before I fell asleep.

1287200287.0,drx95,A few tips from your friends at r/trees,B3bop,54,17,20,"**1.** If you're going to short something make sure you blow the smoke out. It'll taste less like ass when you light it back up.

**2.** For better burning

**3.** If you're new to packing and you're having a hard time keeping your bowl lit then it's probably packed too tight

**4.** Always keep your pieces clean, and keeps you from looking dirty.

**5.** Practice rolling with tobacco or the same weed over a large flat surface (so you don't lose the ground weed) until you get the hang of it. It's a great skill to have and surprisingly hard to do.

**6.** Always treat your dealer well and he will (most likely) do the same with you.

**7.** Hot water in bongs makes it easier on your throat and makes a smoother hit. While cold water (with or without ice) makes the smoke stack better and for experienced smokers can smooth the hit.

**8.** Most people cough because the smoke expands while in your lungs

**9.** Air tight containers will keep your nugs fresh and keep the thc from leaving it (I use pill containers

**10.** Always carry eye drops and an extra lighter, I personally like bausch &amp; lamb's Opcon-A as it works just as well if not better for me without the burn).

**11.** If you don't live on your own

**12.** You can get a P.O. box for like $30 a year

**13.** Always know how big a hit you can take

**14.** If the bowl is cherried

**15.** Speaking of kief

**16.** Keep a drink nearby

**17.** **NEVER** drink bong water.

**18.** THC is a relatively non-polar molecule, but not as well in either case as fat or water would. In this case, you can dissolve THC in it -- losing more than you would if you used water, but not by a whole lot.
Theoretically

**19.** Don't use liquor as a bong water

**20.** Appreciate the taste of good bud and you'll gain bonus points from many more experienced smokers.

**21.** You can change out your bong water with flavored waters or sodas to change the taste (though I've never noticed a difference to be honest).

**22.** The cheapest upgrade you can make to a bong is to get a diffuser stem

**23.** When shopping for pieces

**24.** If there's a need to mask the smell you can make a sploof by taking an empty toilet paper roll and filling it with dryer sheets. (for a better, usually by the fish) then rubber band a dryer sheet around the open top so they don't spill out on you).

**25.** Dealers usually give discounts if you buy larger amounts

**26.** Getting caught with a scale automatically elevates possession to intent to distribute

**27.** In a pinch you can make a pipe out of almost anything. (a pen, etc.) some people enjoy building their own.

**28.** Vaporizers are great

**29.** If you can't roll you can always get a roller from a head shop or online which makes it incredibly easy (as long as you have papers that fit)

**30.** Cologne or axe does NOT cover up weed

**31.** The best way to cover up the smell of weed smoke is with cigarette smoke.

**32.** You can chew gum or use the on the go toothbrushes (these work better

**33.** If you're being pulled over and want to get rid of the smell of weed on your breath

**34.** Blown out speakers make great places to hide paraphernalia as you can remove 3/4 screws and swing the top open (kind of like butterfly doors on a lambo) and nobody ever suspects it. (pens also work for skinny joints if you cut the stem [part holding the ink)

**35.** Don't use a zippo to light your bowl

**36.** Smoke the corners. Imagine the bowl in four sections and try to light only one of those sections. That'll save you from ""scorching"" (quickly burning up) your trees.

**37.** If your joint is really tight (hard to pull when smoking)

**38.** Some people don't have Iron Lungs and that full bong might look intimidating. Put your hand on top of the bong and take some long deep breathes to get some oxygen in your blood stream

**39.** Ask around and learn how to properly pack a tobacco pipe

**40.** Buy a pipe tool. They cost around 2 bucks and can be bought at any tobacconist and it will be your best friend. Plus even experienced smokers will be impressed with this device.

**41.** When you're smoking a joint and its on the last third; making passing awkward; pass right hand to right hand or left to left and go index to index then pinch with the thumb. It's the best passing method and it always works.

**42.** For joints

**43.** Leaving baking soda in a dish overnight can absorb some of the smoke smell in your car.

**44.** If you need to cover the smell in your car immediately -- maybe if you're being pulled over -- light a cigarette.

**45.** Blowing smoke through a tube with a dryer sheet will mask the smell.

**46.** Eating an apple will remove smoke breath (and cotton mouth). They also taste great.

**47.** Trying to light a roach on your stove because you lost all your matches and lighters could result in you smelling your hair being burned.

**48.** Take hits you're comfortable with

**49.** If you're not the provider of the trees don't try to fill up your lungs and kill the bowl in one hit. This will annoy every one else.

**50.** If you're smoking some one else's trees and you have trees yourself offer to match them on the trees you smoked or offer to throw some of yours into the bowl or even green-cap it. This will win you some cool points and respect with whom ever you're smoking with.

**51.** **Lastly:** Enjoy the process. Relax and breath.

1345978639.0,yukjh,So I smoked some WEIRD shit today. What was it?,Humpsta,46,9,28,"I've been smoking weed occasionally for about six months or so

It was merely described as 'Zzzzz-zing' on the packet.
The leaves were chopped up, and the smoke smelt kind of musky.

It got me REALLY high

Loss of balance
Tingling
Complete loss of concentration
Strobe-time lapse type effect similar to weed
Complete disorientation.
Gave me a radical head-ache afterwards.

Anyone know what it might be?

So basically I'm around 75% sure that what I smoked was 'spice'

I started suspecting her for toking after she started coming home some days
i dont think it's a bad thing but i kinda hoped for me to be the one introducing her to trees, but i dont think it would be etically correct, i mean, shes not going through my stuff, so im worried of freaking her out.

Shes almost 16 and im 17 close to 18.
Long story short: My 15 year old sister might be toking, and she might smoke with bad people. What should i do?

Update: I talked with her today when she got home, but generally it turned out great! The talk went something like:

''Hey

''Uhm

5 seconds pass and i tell her: ''well

Still not completely sure of how to react she says: ''Your best friend? whats wrong with you

I then looked her in the eyes and said: ''Not yet... Wanna come smoke with me?''

We then had the most intimate brother-sister talk about how i was always gonna be there for her, if we were ever in prison together, i would totally shank someone if they looked at you the wrong way...''

This guy somehow convinced me to buy a sack of shake off of him that he claimed to have bought from the dispensary. I told him to pack a bowl of it first so I could see its quality. I'm now thinking that he already planned for this to happen, despite it being ground up.

I didn't really exam the bag much because I didn't feel a need to (I thought I could trust this guy). But now that I look at it,  but when I more closely exam it, it looks wrong. There's a few leaves that look bright yellow, and there is long, thin, orange sticks scattered throughout the bag as well. Furthermore, it just doesn't seem to smell like weed to me. It definitely does not smell skunky at all

The first reason I got suspicious of this shit though was that it gave me a weird high. I didn't feel the usual feeling of calmness and relaxation that I get with weed, one hit of this will make me feel very stoned, whereas I usually have to smoke a full bowl to reach this level, as I have built up a tolerance. 

I have bought sacks off this guy in the past, which is another reason I'm so reluctant to say he ripped me off. 

I don't know

Hey /r/saplings, I'm still financially dependent on my very, very anti-drug parents, and I still am on their medical insurance plan.

For the past two years, but I want to avoid that for obvious reasons.


A few of my friends were nice enough to let me try week last year, and was able to eat without the fear of having to throw up. I've toked up with them sporadically over the past year, and it's helped pretty much each time, but I feel bad for continuously mooching off of them.

So - I think it would be ideal for me to try to get a card. But

1) Do I even qualify for MMJ in California? I read the law, but I'm still able to do most of my normal activities most of the time. It's only really bad once every few months, when I can't move or eat or anything.

2) If I do qualify

3) If I do manage to get a card, while CBD is the main compound that helps with the pain. While I'd obviously love some sweet head highs, if I'm going to use this medically, I want to make sure that it would be effective.

4) Are any of you suffering from a similar condition? Does weed help? Or is it just my wishful thinking?


I'm living with my parents this summer, at least I'd be in my own apartment and have my own car. I'd really appreciate any answers/advice. Thanks again ents!",,False,self,t5_2rukl,False,,

Now I should state that I haven't toked in about two months - maybe longer. And I should also state the last times I smoked up I was with good friends and just chill with it

However, but whilst high I would see the colours, the nature, the buildings, the lights and everything around me as so interesting, vivid, enjoyable.

But recently I've been going through some experiences when I smoke. Like, international relations, and the different gas supplies in Europe and different corporations and things. All that stuff I'm half educated in. And I just feel like it's all pointless. Now, perhaps there's some good stuff created in there. Like my guitar, it makes me feel nice to just play with the strings and here the music. And some songs etc help me. But it seems like all of this stuff we've built up, this civilized world, is pointless and erroneous and if humanity had just dealt with its issues it would never have found the need to get to 7,000, and dingy blocks of flats and unhappy families in cramped council housing...eugh.

It's like

And the thing is that at the moment, making plans for the future and stuff. But when I get high (at least, as of 2-3 months ago), I just seem to get stuck in a rut surrounded by stuff that other people care about (like exams), but I - vainly and stupidly - feel too smart to just take at face value and enjoy.

1329268520.0,ppzrb,first timer's guide for obsessive worriers with a glass pipe,stonercommando,36,8,9,"The goal:

To have a pleasant newbie experience with your glass pipe and weed.

The plan:

You're going to take one or two hits.  Later on when you're more comfortable with the ride

Cautions:

* consider weed to be a mood ENHANCER, unless you want to be in a worse mood.

* you might cough.  later you will get better at smoking and this won't be as big of an issue.

* people on youtube take monster hits.  you don't need to do that, giant hits will make you cough.

* weed is not toxic, don't drive while stoned.

* don't talk to cops while sober or stoned.  don't take your weed outside.

* if you're not listening to your favorite music

* don't take any other drugs

The procedure:

1) have a trusted friend with you

2) pick an activity to do while high, have your shoes on.  if you're going to nap, no preparation is necessary.

3) break off a pea-sized chunk of material.  put it into the pipe

4) Hold the pipe in your right hand

5) apply flame to the material, suck down some fresh air.  hold it a little bit, then exhale.

6) repeat once at most

7) go drink some cool water to soothe your mouth.

8) chew some gum to get your saliva flowing to combat potential dry mouth.

9) burn some incense or something to get rid of the smell.

10) don't worry about leftovers.  put your pipe away and smoke them later.  they will keep just fine

Things to do now:

* go for a walk

* listen to some epic guitar solos

* watch a funny movie

* play video games

* browse reddit

* eat something

The future:

* figure out how to take cooler hits to reduce coughing.

* figure out how to take bigger hits to get a punchier high.

* find out the differences between smoking a little and smoking a lot.  both are enjoyable

* cook a meal.  nothing is more fun while stoned

* ride your bicycle while stoned.

* clean your glass pipe: put vodka or rubbing alcohol into a ziploc bag.  add kosher salt.  add pipe.  seal bag

* get a vaporizer.  because you're an obsessive worrier

If you freak out:

1) you're not going to freak out.  people have been smoking for thousands of years and they're not into it because it sucks.

2) have your friend distract you.  call them if they're not with you.

3) remember: nobody has ever died from weed.  you will not be the first.  the effects last 1-4 hours
only took two hits

4) people take weed to combat nausea.  if you're nauseous, lie down.

5) people take weed to combat freakouts caused by other drugs.  so weed combats the freakouts -- why are you freaking out?  weed makes you caaaallllm.

6) just go to sleep.  people take weed to combat insomnia

I've read up on the plant and come to the conclusion that it is not as harmful as some people make it out to be (Norway here). Most people I know seem to think it's just as bad as meth, chronicly drowsy and you immidietaly start smoking crack and cocaine after trying it once while your house catches on fire and all of your family members die a horrible painfully slow death and your cat gets run over.

* Where are you cool to smoke? Like the cafes

* Generally, is it considered obnoxious to do so? I presume blunts are fine. I'm also a smoker of cigarettes, and love one after a joint -  is this cool inside cafes?

* Any direct recommendations of specific cafes you found particularly friently / easy going?

* Do i just speak English? I'd imagine alot of them would

* Obviously we don't just wanna crash in cafes all day... any awesome shit to see or do? Any good parks or countryside to find a secluded smoke spot outside of the city?

1335904455.0,t21xl,"Your medical marijuana RECOMMENDATION and what that means to you, what you can do with it, and the law.",Peffico,36,7

**What exactly is a recommendation?**

-A recommendation is exactly what it is. A recommendation on a piece of paper from a doctor saying that your pain/anxiety/stress will be subsided with the help of cannabis. It is usually good for up to one year. (depends on the state.) Your rec(ommendation) allows you to go to **licensed** cannabis dispensaries and legally buy cannabis from there.

**Then what the flap is this card I hear?**

Here is the key difference a card can only be obtained after you get your rec. You pay an extra fee and you get an I.D. card to go with your rec. Basically it says to cops ""Yes officer
Do you need a card? No
Is it a good idea to have one? Yes

**How do I go about getting this rec?**

Well first off you need to live a state that allows medical cannabis. 
[Pretty helpful link for what you can posses in your state](http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000881)

**What if I don't?**

If you live near the border of state that's next to a medical state just go there. However your rec won't help you with your state's P.D.

**And if I do?**

Now it's time to find a doctor that will analyze you. A quick search of google and your state should be sufficient enough to find a doctor. However always ask around or read reviews about doctors who give out recs. Always find out this about them.

* 1. Are they licensed by your state? (If they aren't they your rec isn't worth anything.)
* 2. How relax are they on giving you your card?
* 3. How much is it?
* 4. Do I need any medical records? (More on this later)

Also always calling the place that will evaluate you is always good. Just don't ask how chill they are lol.

*Pro tip* 

*Go to a dispensary with a friend who has their rec and look around the place. Usually the have deals that will knock quite a few dollars off your evaluation.*

Next it's time to go see a doctor. If you need medical records bring them. All states say you need them

Fill out a few forms and you are ready to see the doctor.

*Pro tip* 

*Try to avoid anything to with past medical visits to hospitals. They will need those records too and it's just a hassle. but sometimes it can't be avoided.*

Next you go in and see the doctor tell him why you feel you would benefit from cannabis. He/She takes your blood pressure and viola you get your rec! 

*PRO TIPS ALL DAY BABY!* 

*My doctor was a dick

**So I got it now what?**

You can use it right away

If you need help finding a place here's a useful link. [Weedmaps.com](http://legalmarijuanadispensary.com)

**So what am I immune to the police?**

Oh lord no you are not immune to our friends in the blue (I know a few cops they are nice people). If you do not have your medical I.D. card they can still arrest you if they suspect fraud on your rec. (Meaning your rec isn't legal). BUT if you have the nifty I.D. card the police can not arrest you for cannabis. (they can still arrest you for something else)

*Dodge the police tip* 

*I know not everyone is going to drive dry

[Also never agree to searches.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDJrQBwJpqk&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL)


**Can I enjoy cannabis anywhere?**

You sure can as long as they allow tobacco in the same place. I wouldn't recommend going to public places though you will get **A LOT** of heat and possibly some calls to the police.

**What can I buy?**

If your dispensary is licensed; anything they are willing to sell. Just remember your state limits.

**Can I grow it?**

Sure can check with your state and their laws about it first though.

**Can I sell it?**

NO! NO! NO! NO! NEVER SELL IT TO ANYONE! It is a felony and you will lose your rec **FOREVER** if you are caught selling. And if it's to a minor you may face prison time. 

**But I want to!**

Then get registered by the state to do so and open up a dispensary.

**What else can't I do**

It's easier to say what you can't do because it's shorter of what you can do lol.

* do not drive
* do not operate heavy machinery
* Keep your stash in your trunk if you are going somewhere with it.


**So what's your story how did you get yours?**

I had a lot of friends who have theirs. And I wanted mine. So I went to a doctor and got it. That was...... 6 months ago so my renewal is coming up soon. Which I have no Idea how that is gonna go as the place I got mine started demanding medical records which I do not want to give. But if it is a problem over there I will just find a different location and get a brand new one again. I have probably bought...... oh lord A LOT of cannabis legally now and I love it.

*TL;DR* Umm fuck you? do it on your own then.

**Pro** 

* Passive enjoyment of things (music, etc.)

* Thought- I feel like I'll have ten times as many thoughts in the same time span and it consequently makes me feel like time goes a bit slower

* Increased sensitivity- my entire body tingles

* Nearly everything is more enjoyable/interesting

* My mind feels sharper although I've yet to test this by attempting to perform any mental tasks while high

* I'll let myself get so high that I end up crashing on the sofa

**Con**

* Spacing out makes me feel like time goes slower

* increased sensitivity- if my back was sore from sitting in a weird position

* munchies- Cool ranch doritos are my kryponite

* I'll let myself get so high that I end up crashing on the sofa

I rolled a pure what must have been 0.5-0.7g joint (pure because I don't smoke) and went out.

got to the park near my house and lit up

I got nearer the plants and sat under a tree for what was probably around 15 minutes but felt like hours

I remember moving around from tree to tree because the sun kept moving into my eyes and it was so fucking beautiful but I didn't want to go blind so i moved. at one point i remember seeing some older couples sitting the other side of the flowerbed to me looking straight at me with the biggest smile on their faces ever

Must have been an hour after I had smoked i started feeling like my heart was going to explode as it felt like it was beating really fast and my right kidney was in agony but I just remembered not to panic and it was all fine and I knew it couldn't be anything bad. at one point someone came up to me and asked if I was okay

I slightly remember waves of pulsing in my head that is just explainable but felt like the best thing ever. I think because I was against a tree I didn't like the thought of spiders or things crawling on me so I kept seeing black shadows over my shoulder or hearing noises that I just put down to my new spidey senses. 

I took a few pictures of my eyes while this happened as I wanted to know if it was still as red as the start because I needed some food and didn't want to turn up with really red eyes. ended up getting a burger and devouring it on the way home.

This is when I started doing a little research and made sure I was inhaling right. I smoke hookah quite a bit and the occasional cigar/cigarette, remove the slide, inhale the smoke, inhale some fresh air on top of the smoke, hold for a couple seconds, then I would exhale and smoke would come out naturally...

* A sensation of pressure around the temples
* Dry mouth. Enhanced sense of touch. Riding a bicycle in sunny weather feels absolutely fantastic at this stage; The air becomes thicker
* 'Floaty' vision. Easy to look at everything at once
* Thoughts begin to arise differently than usual. Increased chance/risk of getting stuck in smaller loops of thought. Minor changes in time perception.
* Tingling sensation in the chest area. I first mistook it as my heart beating insanely fast
* Minor rush of euphoria coupled with a warming and intensification of colours. Music sounds/feels great. Writing feels amazing
* Small vibrations/pulses in parts of legs. It's almost as if I can feel the blood going through certain places of my body. At least that's what I imagine.

Let me describe my primary smoking set up at home first.

I smoke outback on my patio surrounded on three sides by exterior walls of my house. It isn't closed in though (no roof/fourth wall). I also have a 7ft fence around my back yard. And to top it off my entire property is lined with huge evergreen trees. There is probably about 15-20ft between my back yard and my neighbor's yards. 

with that being said... do you think they can smell my smoke? Would the wind make the smell travel faster or dissolve it? 

After I finish smoking (others i assume as well) it is kinda hard to smell anything else other than burnt trees. But when I'm smoking outside during the day and I hear my neighbors in the next yard and I hope that they don't smell me and get me into some shit

**For when you're buying bud:**

1. Dense bud

2. Dry/cured bud. Damp bud absolute **no**. You want it dry but not crispy where it falls apart in your hands. Usually if the bud is dried too fast it can be crispy on the outsides but danker towards the middle.

3. Trichomes/Sugar/Resin on the bud. Like all my points is contentious - but trying to be helpful for *most of the time.* Things like kush have massive calyxes but could have less visible sugar on the buds surface - but **as a rule** if its covered then you're set. Conversely if its not and is a bit airy I'd say thats poorly grown and not worth your money.

4. Strain names. OK well just ignore them - not because they could be lying or misinformed but because its entirely about the end product. Seed companies (won't name any names) have been pumping out crosses like ""Super Cheese Purple Hindu Kushberry Haze"". Anyway

-----------------

5. Trim/Manicure. The little leaves on the bud are called sugar leaves

6. Smell, a bit like a fruity stench are a bit more buzzy but still stoney. Lemony smells you might expect to be a bit more buzzy and heady, I'm less confident about this but its very largely true.

And the purple thing

Typically, this time I decided I wanted to smoke more than I normally do, plus go back for more. I wanted to get higher than I ever had before. 

But something went incredibly wrong.

I blazed a really full bowl in my glass pipe. I felt amazing. I could have settled down for the night but I really wanted to experience a higher high. I had a five minute break and drunk some water. 

Then I fired up my bong. One massive load

So I packed the same stinky payload in the bong again. Making the grand total three large bowls. 

By this time I was higher than I had ever been before. I sat in my bathroom, although the rocking felt involuntary. I decided I needed to move spots. I got up off the toilet (lid closed - btw) and walked into our bedroom. I flopped on the bed, and got under the covers. I felt horrible. 

The sensation is usually somewhat consistent for me

It was almost as if my brain no longer had any conscious function. I was only reactive. My biggest tasks at hand were breathing, as if I could slip away and die if I wasn't careful. I don't know if I could honestly say I was going to die or not. But I knew I had to ""be careful""; this phrase kept echoing in my mind. Does anyone else get inner ""mantras"" stuck on repeat? 

My whole body was humming. Like I was holding up a seashell

I was laying flat in bed, showering high, eating high, listening to music high; this one takes the cake. This vomit felt like a stream of my insides had been sucked into the mouth of a dementor. 

The worst part was what I think was a ""death of the ego"". I felt physically separate from myself. I didn't see myself from above or any thing crazy like that, to ""you are just a concept"". I was happy my intellect had resurfaced but I couldn't shake this notion. As a collection of atoms, forming various chemical combinations, shaped into various organelles deep inside cells, each with separate duties, forming different organs, all part of different bodily systems: all aiming to construct ""me"". Yet I was an idle, ""bystander"". I was just a concept. The very notion of my ""favourite color"" or ""my siblings"" etc seemed to be absolutely ludicrous. I was just a concept. I identify as jrh1984 - to appease my own subconscious need for ""identity"".     

So. Lesson learned: 

**• When you feel like you've had enough: you've had enough. You can always go back for more (which I never even got around to).**

Edit: Because some were asking about how I located said dealer

It wasn't too complicated at all. I was with a good friend of mine who I occasionally smoke with, and said that he could contact his dealer. 

At this point I immediately asked him to make sure with his dealer that it was okay that I texted him. When it was confirmed that everything was cool, and let him know that my friend had referred me to him. 

From there it was all business. Very straightforward and professional, and what strains he had available at the time. We eventually met later that night across from his apartment building and made the deal.

Pros: Out of sight
Cons: Dusty

Second spot was in a desk drawer.
Pros: Easy access
Cons: Extremely easy to find

Third spot: In a metal box on my dresser
Pros: Out of sight
Cons: Out in plain sight

Fourth and best spot: Behind a dresser drawer. Most dressers have drawers that can  come out of the dresser to make them easier to move from place to place. I removed one of my drawers while cleaning and found out that there was a large enough open space in the back of the dresser to fit my stash perfectly.
Pros: Incredibly hard to find, plenty of space   considering I can do this with multiple drawers, none of my friends thought of it before me.
Cons: When I'm a bit too high it can be hard to put back.

So the only ingredients you will need are:

Nutella

4 Eggs

and weed

What you need to do is first take about 4 ounces of nutella (about a third of the [typical nutella jar](http://siouxsielaw.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/nutella.jpg)).  Mix in 2-4 grams of weed (depending on the strength you want your cake to have).  Mix the two things in a bowl until they are blended well.  Now, and it would gain strength marginally, or you could just go ahead and make the cake.  Once again, it just depends on how strong you want your cake.

So once you have the pot nutella, and again until all the egg is mixed.

Then pour the batter in your pan, I advise against eating more than a quarter of the cake at a time.

1347293002.0,znos4,Am I intolerant or is anxiety causing problems?,Fuckenjames,25,2,10,"When I search for tolerance most of the stuff that comes up is about people taking breaks or just starting out.

I smoke just about every day. The only days I don't is when I don't have time to. If I'm getting home and have nothing that needs my attention I will smoke until I pass out. This is generally due to anxiety and stress that I've been feeling after coming out of a serious relationship. Weed replaced alcohol for me.

I've started smoking with other people more often recently and I find that I seem to feel quite a bit higher sooner than everyone else seems to act. This just causes me more anxiety and is the reason I smoke alone most of the time.

I feel like I'm far less tolerant than most people. I felt like that during my last relationship too when I smoked with my stoner girlfriend. I've tried smoking in large volumes but my tolerance doesn't seem to increase when I'm smoking socially.

I've heard that some people are just overly sensitive to marijuana and I am wondering if I'm one of those people

The biggest problem I have is I become overly concious about the way I act and the things I say when I'm high. I feel like my insecurities are increased when I'm not in complete control. I also tend to make comments about being high and feel like I'm coming across as someone who just started smoking weed (I started in 2009).

So the other night I hit a gravity bong at a friends house. I've never had such an intense hit and immediately felt nauseous seconds after the hit. A couple more seconds and everything got very slow, and stumbled to the couch. Next thing I remember is hearing my friend yelling at me to wake up. 
At this point though I had lost sense of reality. It was almost an out of body experience, and I kept telling my friend I was about to die. He persisted in trying to get me to snap out of it, but eventually I just couldn't react anymore. I thought to myself ""I'm dead. This is it. "" I was not in this world anymore, but in limbo between life and death. Everything was gone, but I could hear everything. My friend begging me to wake up, the others trying to help. Everything was no longer there, I felt like death had finally come.  I just wanted to pass on to the other side, and I was content in going through it. I heard my friend's screams, I just anted help before it got worse. Eventaully reality set back in


I have no idea why this happened to me and no one else. After doing a bit of research, because it's been two days and my head still slightly hurts and I feel nautious whenever I eat. I feel I'm recovering, but very slowly.

1340699925.0,vmdfk,A sapling's revelation.,CHooTZ,24,2,9,"Hello, so I've been smoking significantly.

I will usually smoke one of two ways; through my bong filled with normal water, as you can just pull away and not waste much. On the other hand, I really enjoy the bong as it's a cleaner hit, with the water filtering it, it's a little cooler, and I feel like I get higher or more bang-for-my-buck on the bong. Unfortunately, if I accidentally get a big cherry on the bong, or wasting some of the smoke.

This leaves me at today, and on my first bowl the difference was *immediately* obvious. The smoke was waaaay cooler and much easier to manage. With this smoke I didn't have to limit myself due to heat, leading to my main restriction now being how much I can fit in my lungs, now how hot my throat is. I was no longer afraid to milk a good cherry as I didn't have to cap myself nearly as badly. Due to me not having to stop midway through cherries, I could use up all of them, and this was a much faster process as I didn't have to keep pausing.

In the end, more relaxing, less harsh and way easier. My spoon will still have its use as a portable option, but never am I going to chose to smoke though room-temp water again.

**TLDR:** 
Decided to try ice in my bong's water. The experience was *much* better, less harsh and way easier. Definitely give it a try.

Fast forward to this week, putting maybe like ~0.3g into the bowl and taking like 4 big hits and maybe a couple smaller ones. I inhale into my lungs, hold for 5 seconds and exhale, knowing I have reached my lungs since the smoke is normally pretty much gone. The first time, I felt my face become 'heavy'(?), like my whole face just felt like it was being weighted down. Also felt a kind of 'buzz' but no enjoyable sensations really. Second day, I smoked and whilst walking around, it would shake a little as I put weight on it

Then.. I smoked earlier today, I was flinching every time it happened and my senses were on edge. I was hearing noises downstairs (me being the only one in) and was kind of paranoid that someone was in. I read online about the crunching sound and pretty much every symptom was terrible. It was like, cancer, heart problems, blood clots, schizophrenia. Now reading schizophrenia scared me a good bit, and I was panicking like mad hoping I hadn't damaged my mental health.

I actually just made my second purchase and want to check how I'm doing. I'll be as specific as possible so I can see what I am doing wrong. It may seem obvious but I've only smoked a couple times with friends and they never really gave any advice other than ""hold it in.""

I bought a quarter the other day. I don't have a scale but it's a huge dense nug and smells very strongly of skunk. It's dark green with some orange streaks and kind of dim

(I don't have any pictures because I don't like messing with weed while everyone else is awake)

So, fine pieces. 

This is where I think I am going wrong: After that

Often times, burnt matter (is that the resin?) and I find that the middle and bottom of the weed is pretty much intact. 

Anyway

I don't really know what being stoned is *supposed* to feel like. My high consists of feeling like my face has a muscle relaxant, it just feels like my head is floating. Also, my eyes get red, but that is probably obvious.  My blood pressure seems to get a little bit higher. Not alarmingly so, but noticeably. 

These feelings are cool, but only if I'm sitting there kind of concentrating on the high. If I don't do that and I move around, I feel mostly normal and am able to focus on tasks, but kinda zoned out.

I just started smoking about month ago. First time I bought dealer gave it to me in a plastic bag that was inside a glass jar. He let me borrow the jar for 12 hours and then I had to figure it out on my own. I kept it in tupperware for a few weeks then transfered it to an orange prescription bottle which i continued to keep inside tupperware. All the time the tupperware was in a drawer.

A couple days ago I got a grinder but didn't have time to really smoke so I stupidly just grinded some weed and left it there for almost a week now. I packed a bowl today and smoked like half of it before I suddenly remembered reading about ""whiteys"" and moldy weed. I looked at my remaining bowl

I'm thinking about throwing away the rest because it was in that little plastic bag so long. However

I'm definitely investing in a tight glass bottle for my new purchase and I plan on buying some 95% rubbing alcohol and soaking everything in it. I can take some pictures but they won't be real high resolution.

Also tips for future storage?

edit: been about an hour and a half now -- my little bit of light headedness has worn off.

The guy that runs it is really down-to-Earth, methodical, and straightforward.  And his videos answered a ton of questions I had about weed.  Every once in a while, but it's usually stuff that an internet-savvy smoker would be interested in.

Here's some memorable vids:

I'm in highschool and terribly antisocial.  I have maybe 4-5 good friends and I know for a fact that none of them smoke/have ever smoked.  I know a kid, but I'd notice that he died.  Anyway, I know without a doubt in my heart that he is in to trees(bongs, pipes, he has that stuff).  How would I go about asking him for some?  Or should I ask who he gets it from?  I'd rather not ask the pizza delivery guy if he has a hook up.  There is a community college a little bit away(10, 15 minutes?) but I don't really want to walk around(being 15-17) looking for people doing drugs.  

Are real life drug dealers as nice as the ones on TV?  They give you a free sample as a prospective customer and hope you return willing to purchase?  That would be sweet.

I'm in the market for a job

I have lighters and stuff

Rolling papers.  On Harold and Kumar he ripped a page out of a phonebook and use it

If I manage to get some trees but dont have a job yet

Lets say I manage to buy some trees after all and now I have them in my possession, joints for me?  I'm sure I can google how to roll a joint, but do I need to tear up that shit in to teeny tiny pieces? 

More questionssss:

How long does a high last?

Will I get the munchies?  Seriously though
good thing.

Will(Could) trees help me fall asleep easier?  It takes anywhere from one to three hours(or more) of laying in bed doing nothing for me to fall asleep.

The first thing that really needs to be established is that there are two ways to take a drag off of something.  The first involves inhaling directly through whatever it is you're smoking (this is most commonly properly used in smoking bongs) which alone is generally not how you're ""supposed"" to smoke.  My friends and I call this method of smoking, and inhaling air on top of the smoke in your mouth (most commonly used alone properly in smoking cigarettes and joints).

When smoking a pipe and attempting to take a big or fast rip, inhale very slowly, while using my cheeks to pull air, until I can feel thick smoke at the back of my throat.  I let off the carb at that point and inhale air through it to clear the chamber, then take the piece away from my mouth and inhale air.  You can take hits that are two or three times bigger than straight inhaling in half the time, with a fraction of the harshness.

This is something I've found most people naturally do, nor the most efficient way to take a hit.  Everyone talks about cornering the bowl and only touching the lighter to it for a few seconds, but not many touch on the act of actually inhaling the smoke.  Give this a try if you don't already and see how it works for you.",,False,self,t5_2rukl,,http://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/emi41/how_to_smoke_properlytake_big_hits/

I've done some reading around this and other subreddits and still have a few remaining questions. If these have been covered elsewhere please forgive me

1. I have recently become what you could maybe call friends with someone who I know for sure is an ENT. I have brought up my interest and he has told me that he wouldn't mind smoking with me in a safe environment. This was about a month ago however. Should I bring it up again and how should I go about doing so?

2. I wouldn't feel right smoking someone's weed without reimbursing them in some way. Should I give them money or pay them back in another way. (How much should I pay them?)

3. I don't know exactly what I would want to do. Should I have a general idea

4. From what I have read so far I should stay away from edibles

5. My mother is not what I would call anti-weed but I don't know how she would react to me smoking. If/when I do try it I will be doing it somewhere that isn't my house. Are there any particular precautions I should take to make sure she doesn't find out? 

6. Is there anything I should be aware of for the first time, etc.?

7. Say things go well and I smoke a few more times and decide to try to get some for myself. Should I try to make connections through the previously mentioned person?

* What are you doing

**Smell of Weed**

* How potent is the smell of weed? Is it stronger when it's dormant (hidden in your room) or when it's actually being smoked?

**Smoke Spots**

* How do you find a good outdoor spot to smoke? How far from civilization do you have to be so the smell doesn't tip someone off? How do you avoid getting caught? 

I'm asking because there's this amazing place a half hour drive from me that I'd *love* to smoke at -- right by a waterfall. It's not a public park (to my knowledge) and a few people do go there from time to time, and it's my *ideal* chillage zone.

**Transporting Weed**

* If I buy, put it in a plastic baggy, then put that plastic baggy inside a disposable plastic container/pill bottle/etc. will it stink up my car if it's in there for about an hour drive?

**Steps Before/During/After Buying Weed**

I know at least three people off the top of my head who I could contact about getting a hold of some herb. I'm nervous about buying my first stash

* Do I need to ""weed proof"" my room before I buy some? I'm living with my mother (I'm 21

* If it's *doable* to smoke at my mother's house until I move, and back. Would the smell of weed be too overpowering?

**This is the story of how it went the first time I used trees. Written the very next morning after.**


I had just bought the MFLB. I was planning on smoking it with my gf &amp; my best friend today

During my drive back

After much internal debating

I took out 1g (my dealer gave me 1 little plastic back per g) from the aluminum container I had. I took 1/3 of it and put it in my grinder. Grounded up that

I opened my MFLB and started pouring into the trench, which I thought was brilliant.

I left it there

After a couple of matches

Went to get my *MFLB*

I pressed the battery in and after a few seconds

Did not feel a thing. Tried without the stem as I realized there were times I was letting go of the battery; didn't realize I needed to press it that hard during the entire process. I shook the herbs between hits. Coughing happened

No stem, after another wasted hit, I finally got the hang of it and started to *feel* the vapor instead of just tasting it. Figured I was leaving my mouth way too open and the vape was escaping.

About the taste: It tastes just like tobacco

Still not feeling that much, after a few seconds, it hit me. 

I felt a need to sit down

After the initial buzz

Here's a rundown of how I felt:

**Physically**

* My body felt heavy and kinda clumsy
* I felt dizzy
* I felt like someone replaced my blood with lemonade. My veins felt funny and cold
* I did feel hungry
* You know when stoner rage comics have red eyes and swollen up eyelids? It was exactly like that when I looked at myself in the mirror. Eyes were as pink as cotton candy.
* I was having a hard time maintaining a train of thought

**Emotionally**

* I felt a kind of calm inside. Felt like everything was gonna be just fine.
* It was almost physically impossible for me to get mad or upset about something. I was just...happy.
* Just wanted to talk. I felt friendly as hell. 
* Relaaxxxxxxxxx
* I did not feel any kind of paranoia or fear.

That effect lasted about 2 hours (didn't know if it would have lasted more, but I was still pretty numb and happy when I went to sleep.

If I were to imagine how high could you get with trees, but what I felt was pretty intense. Of course, it personally was my [10].

So that's that.
As far as addiction goes

There's a desire

Thanks to everybody who helped me. The guys from /r/trees

Today I will be smoking with my best friend

Thank you for reading this.

I went to the person's apartment and we had a friendly by brief conversation ( I didn't want to be a lingerer) and exchanged the goods:). It went really smoothly!
