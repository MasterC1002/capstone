1370059566.0,1fg533,"If you find one person who truly loves you, you're lucky. -- One of the most profound explanations of love I've ever heard.",fastpicker89,140,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/ZenHabits/comments/1fg533/if_you_find_one_person_who_truly_loves_you_youre/

I've always had difficulty connecting to people, I am profoundly opposed to simple, small talk and the cyclical patterns of ups and downs that I watch most relationships suffer from. It seems to me that, although people claim they want to find their 'soul mate' or their 'best friend,' what most people are looking for is someone to give voice to their inner silence so they can avoid having to answer life's big questions. Why seek something greater if you have others around to occupy you? To me, this is the easy way to coast through your life, no real responsibility to anyone or anything - but always just a consenting participant. One of the masses. I am completely unable to relate to this mentality in so, right? Lukewarm. 

I first became aware of this when I was about 11. I have a childhood friend that lives her life this way, no expectations can be had at any point. And I don't even mean the expectation that she would be there in an emergency, I mean like...nothing - not even plans for later in the evening. She always operates on an ""Only if it's perfect for me,"" mentality. And yet the expectation on her friends from her is considerable. It seems to be how these types of things work. And yet somehow, she seems happy...at least outwardly.

Although this friend is an example, we are able to create a safe environment where we have the blessing of learning about one another, and perhaps more importantly, learn from one another. It is through these relationships that we are able to discover ourselves and learn who we are, how we feel about the world, and so many other profoundly important things. But what happens when no one is willing to put in the time and effort required to achieve this? What then happens to the world?

It's an absurd phenomenon to me because it's truly very ironic. How often do we hear others complain about how no one is listening, how can you expect them to do the same for you? Take a minute to think about your best relationship for just a minute...what separates it from the rest? Is it because you grew up together and don't know anything else? Is it a sibling that has always been there? Is it that person you met on the first day at a new school? Is it your new roommate that you found on the internet and call your best friend because of proximity? Why is this person special to you? For me, what separates the people I value apart from everyone else is the connection I am able to make to them. 

There is a quote that goes something like this:

Simple minds discuss others.


Average minds discuss events.


Great minds discuss ideas. 

I like to think about this when I am observing relationships around me. People seem to thrive on negativity. The existence of this negativity is the basis of their relationship and probably the only real reason that they have anything to say to one another. This overflows in to every facet of this relationship. The people they hate, the server is too slow, the weather sucks, that person did this to me once, et cetera. And then something I find to be extremely strange occurs: they do this to each other. Now, suddenly a group of friends forms and is made up of people who are each saying negative things about the others, consistently. And they know this is happening! Do any of them really like one another? And how do they come up with so many 'small talk' things to say? I just can not for the life of me understand what these types of people are gaining from one another except the lack of outward loneliness. But maybe that's all they're seeking...

What I've Learned:

People do not really care about you. They might seem that they do for a glimmer of time, the job we have; everything is all to create a very specific image of what we want to project to the world. This is no different when it comes to 'good deeds' we do for others. This is the exact thing that makes charities so successful. People love to show off all the good they've done for the world. But what about the people that do silent good deeds that no one ever hears about? This still makes that person feel that they are a better person for what they did. Maybe they did want to do something nice for someone else, but only because they like the way it makes them feel. This is not altruism, it's narcissism. I like to believe it exists out there somewhere in chosen special people. I'll even say that I believe myself to be one of those people, because one of my life's callings is to connect to others, and to help them learn to do so in return. But I can't be the judge of that. Truly, that's why a real friend is not only important, and it makes you a better person. 

We sort of live in an age of 'whoever cares the least has the most power, we are given the capacity to think and process ideas, concepts, and emotions. It is our quest to learn to connect to the world around us and our responsibility to ourselves not to let the fear of what we might discover cripple us. This is why we are designed to respond to community. We genuinely need others to help us along this path, to support us, guide us, and love us - just as we do for them. Unfortunately, it is my sincere hope that you can learn to bring that in to your friendships

So, no matter how difficult. You are forever bonded by your love for each other and the loyalty that stems from that is unbreakable. While up to this point I've only been able to find that with my family, it is my passionate hope that it is possible for this love to exist out of the dynamic of your nuclear family system. I see no reason you can't love someone unconditionally that wasn't born right next to you. Maybe love is taught. Maybe it is felt. And maybe if you don't have an example of this kind of love in your foundation, you are unable to experience it. Whatever the reason may be, I wish you all the gift of an unconditional relationship with another. But I urge you to be the type of person that gives this love in return. If we can truly accomplish this, we could change the world - one relationship at a time.

I am glad I did because yesterday was one the more unlucky days in my life but it didn’t fell bad being in the middle of uncertainty. I was driving home from a concert

Someone died that day, it wasn’t the passenger in the car but a deer. (poor deer is probably still lying on the concrete with a licence plate in his gut). I feel sorry for the deer, yes but I am happy to be alive. 

Anyway what this taught me, there was nothing I could do about the poor deer, there was nothing I could do about the car not working any more. 
So here I am 100 miles away from home, low cellphone battery. 
2 months from now I would have freaked out, I was calm, I was thinking rational about what I should do to fix this. I had plenty of time to think about my life. and I realised, I don’t need that car..
Yes I have a bunch of stuff to take care of now, when there isn’t one there to start with.

The truth is this subreddit has *always* been about more than just Zen. It was originally created by a dozen or so bloggers who covered various things in self-improvement: 

- Leo Babauta (Zen Habits - simplicity/meditation/productivity - hence the name of this reddit)

- Jonathan Mead (Illuminated Mind - self-improvement/business)

- Charles Gilkey (Productive Flourishing - productivity/motivation)

- Adam Baker (Man vs. Debt - personal finance)

- Jonathan Fields (JonathanFields.com - productivity/writing/entrepreneurship)

As well as a handful of other bloggers who covered stuff about happiness, goals, motivation, simplicity, etc.

That's why the title of this subreddit is ""Zen Habits and Self-Growth

I try all day long to keep myself from useless thinking, I just have a little freak out without realizing it. When I'm at my calmest with people I've known for a long time I feel much more creative and witty but my charm instantly turns into this self-defeating blankness when I'm around certain or new people. The only thing that makes me, me around these people is alcohol, and I'm not about to go become a full-fledged alcoholic at this point, but I notice that I love myself when I've had a few. I want that drunken disregard for any doubts in my mind, but whilst sober.

""What can people do to be happy?""

1. ***Realizing that enduring happiness doesn't come from making it.*** People adapt to changing circumstances- even to wealth or a disability. Thus
2. ***Take control of your time.*** Happy People feel in control of their lives, given just a little progress every day.
3. ***Act happy.*** We can sometimes act ourselves into a frame of mind. Manipulated into a smiling expression, are optimistic, and are outgoing. Going through the motions can trigger the emotions.
4. ***Seek work and leisure that engage your skills.*** Happy people often are in a zone called ""flow"" -absorbed in a task that challenges them without overwhelming them. The most expensive forms of leisure (sitting on a yacht) often provide less flow experience than gardening
5. ***Join the ""movement"" movement.*** An avalanche of research reveals that aerobic exercise not only promotes health and energy but also is an antidote for mild depression and anxiety. Sound minds reside in sound bodies. 
6. ***Give your body the sleep it wants.*** Happy people live active, diminished alertness, and gloomy moods.
7. ***Give priority to close relationships.*** Intimate friendships with those who care deeply about you can help you weather difficult times. Confiding is good for soul and body. Resolve to nurture your closest relationships: to *not* take those closest to you for granted, to share, and to play together. To rejuvenate your affections, resolve in such ways to *act* lovingly. 
8. ***Focus beyond the self.*** Reach out to those in need. Happiness increases helpfulness. (Those who feel good do good.) But doing good also makes one feel good.
9. ***Keep a gratitude journal.*** Those who pause each day to reflect on some positive aspect of their lives (their health, freedom, education, senses, natural surroundings, and so on) experience heightened well-being.
10. ***Nurture your spiritual self.*** For many people, and a sense of purpose and hope. Study after study finds that actively religious people are happier and that they cope better with crises.

Retire at a regular hour. Partake of food at regular intervals. Eat with moderation and never to the point of satisfaction. 

Receive a guest with the same attitude you have when alone. When alone

Watch what you say

When an opportunity comes do not let it pass by

Do not regret the past. Look to the future. 

Have the fearless attitude of a hero and the loving heart of a child.
