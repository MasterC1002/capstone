Thirdly

But to get to the matters at hand.  I wanted to make this post so when i make a post about CotM post you'll know what's going on or at least be vaguely aware I made a post about something.

When Collector of the Month was started Charles had about 17 people to choose from which made picking quite easy.  When we grew larger Charles would take nominations and then when I came on board He and I would discuss people and come to an agreement.  We stopped this as we ran out of chickens to fight each other.  Also we got more Moderators so 5 people would come to a great conclusion usually on who to nominate.  This works well mostly because 99% of the time

However

So

Thanks for your time

**[Here are our past winners]( http://redvdit.com/cotm)** Keep this in mind when nominating as we like to pick new people when possible.  Or at least someone that's not won in the past year.  Oh look at that,False,self,t5_2sm9e,False,,,t3_1a9gqv

Long time subscriber

So, to recommendations improvements, to improved title descriptions...it could be anything you want.  This is where *you* all come in.  You guys buy DVDs, a lot of them, and I'm sure some of you get some of them from Amazon.  This means you're some of the best customers on the planet and the most qualified to answer the following questions:

* Where do you shop for DVDs most and why?
* Are you Sarah Connor?
* If you do buy on Amazon
* What is a fire
* What are your biggest annoyances with buying DVD/Blu Ray online?
* What is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow?

(If you answer all the above questions I may give you a small prize.)

tl;dr:  What keeps you from saying shut up and take my money when buying titles for your collection online?

So this is a contest that i'm holding for the 1 year anniversary of our beloved subreddit, a regular to an expert, an expert to collector of the month, and now I'm a moderator.  I feel very fortunate to have found such a great subreddit and I strive to make it better.  Hence, I've created this contest.

I'll say upfront that the prize is maybe not as grand as I had hoped

How you ask?  Easily, Recommendations, Discussions, and Inside the Boxes.  Inside the box videos can be found by both Gigafrost and Duals902.  You basically take a box set with extras, open it up, and tell us about the contents.

Pictures are **required** for both Pickups and Inside the Boxes as a *minimum*.  Posting a video will get you a bonus point, simply stating your Reddit username will do, but it's also **required**.  Now for some more rules.

* **Pickups**  No more than 2 in the month are allowed.  You may post more but only two will be counted as entries for the contest.  A minimum of 2 movies will have to be in each pickups post.  (2 points)
* **Recommendations** No more than 2 a week and no more than 8 total.  You can do more than 8 but only 8 will be counted as entries. (8 points) Recommendation posts need to be of substantial quality.  Iâ€™m not asking for 17 paragraphs but if you only post a 1 paragraph RECO you will be informed that it needs to have more content.
* **Discussions** No more than 3 per week and no more than 6 allowed total.  You can do more but they will not count for points. (6 points)
* **Inside the Boxes** No more than 1 per week and no more than 2 allowed total.  You can do more but they will not count for points. (2 points)

If you count that up

When you make a post that you want counted as an entry for the contest, Inside the Box, or Discussion and a link to your post will need to be in the body of the PM.  Please leave a post here, [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdvdcollection&amp;subject=One%20Year%20Anniversary%20Contest%20question), or [message Stalked_Like_Corn](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Stalked_Like_Corn&amp;subject=One%20Year%20Anniversary%20Contest%20question) if you have any questions.

###Moderators can make changes to these rules WITHOUT prior notice to ensure fairness to everyone involved.  If any changes are made they will be posted to the subreddit as well as changed in this post itself.  Bookmarking this post will insure you see if we had to close a loophole that was being exploited.  If anyone is found to be ""gaming the system"" they will be immediately disqualified and may face other punishments up to a warning or even an /r/DVDCollection banning.###

I am very excited about this and something I've been thinking about for a little bit now. We have collectors from all over the world


However what can be done by all of us is watching **one** movie whenever we want every 2 or 3 weeks. 

**So what is /r/dvdcollection movie club**?

*It's like a book club... for movies*

* Once every Two-Three Weeks anyone that's part of the subreddit will be welcome to enjoy and watch a movie that is nominated and voted on by our members. Voting and noms will work much like our movie party noms. Any one can vote

Thats right discussion thread. After 2-3 weeks (each date will be announced when the movie is selected) a discussion thread will be posted by yours truly.  These threads can discuss anything related to the movies, I reserve the right to remove deuch baggery and troll comments that attacks someones opinion. 


I will also be giving out prizes for those that watch the movie and participate in the discussion thread. Thats right double incentive. If you participate in the tread (that is substantial content, you will be eligible for a prize and you can nominate the next movie we watch for the club. 


Some times nominations I ask for will be themed (say horror movies around halloween etc) but other than that the nominations are wide open. I just generally ask that nominations be movies you feel can generate some solid discussion on our subreddit. **Edit**: *Movies need to be available on DVD or Blu-Ray

Discussion can be your reviews and opinions, actors, directors, etc. 


Personally I've been wanting to do this because Sunday nights aren't necessarily the best night for movies for me


So lets get this started!

I'm going to go ahead and select the first movie for us to watch. Its one that is readily available and a very important film in American film history and just a down right damn good film

**Tl;dr**- Movie club... watch a specific movie every couple weeks
__________

**The first movie we will be watching is** *To Kill a Mockingbird*. This film is one of my all time favorite films

Because this is the first film I'll give just over 3 weekends for everyone to watch this film. Please have the film watched by Sunday **May 12th.** (This also allows for people to order the film in time) Either that Sunday or Monday I will post a discussion thread

I encourage any of our collectors to watch this together in /r/dvdcollection  chat as well at anytime they can,False,self,t5_2sm9e,1366819043.0,,action,t3_1d0kke

##What should you be doing right now?
Now then, so some things that are under 10, some over 10, and some crazy priced stuff... The more things you have on your list, the better. Just make sure you actually want the things that you put on your list. You will be getting your matches on Monday, and will be exchanging your lists. You will not be giving to the same person you are receiving from, so this is not a ""give to get"" gift  exchange. 

***

You are only required to get the person one thing on their list, gifts from your local area, movie-related gifts, or random crap that you find laying around your house. (This happens more often than I would like to admit)

First of all
***

##Step one
Post your wishlist and collection list [here](http://redd.it/rfekr)

##Step two
Message the person you are gifting TO and ask for their wishlist and collection if it hasn't been posted. Also ask for their preferred shipping address. If you are in different countries

##Step three
Begin shopping for your giftee! Another fun thing to do is stalk your Giftee on Reddit. Find out if they have posted anything that might be relevant that you could include in your gift to them!

##Step four
Ship! You can ship any time from now up until May 1st.

 It was a collection dedicated to Wrestling DVD's, same with my 360/ps3 games which are also stored in a wallet.

 Back at my parents house I have the boxes for all of them an I'm not too sure what I'm gonna do with they as it looks highly unlikely that I'll get any of the discs back.

- I hail from NYC originally

- Favorite genre? Tough one--I like all kinds, and black comedy if you'll allow me to use it as a film genre. You'll definitely see from my collection that I have varied tastes, although to be fair most of them are random pickups from the $5 bin at Wal-Mart.

- The first DVD I ever bought was *Forbidden Planet*

- I don't have any guilty pleasures. I like what I like and dislike what I dislike

- My least favorite movie I own? Probably *Lucky Number Slevin

- My favorite director is Ingmar Bergman, there's a disturbing lack of Kurosawa in my collection--I make do by borrowing/renting his work whenever I get the urge.

- What I'm most proud of? I don't know. I guess I'm most proud of my four Bergman films--they're certainly the highlights of my collection.

- What I'm looking for? More money. T_T

- I don't use software to keep track of my collection. Any suggestions on free software?

Like the idea? Post your nomination! Have a huge number of films from a certain director, country? Nominate it, and the comment with the most upvotes by the end of the day on Monday (let's say 11:59 PM ET for officialness's sake) will become the Spotlight topic for next week (Tuesday through Saturday).

1354759892.0,14cyje,My introduction and DVD Collection,goldaero,29,2,23,"Hello

1. What city/state/country do you live in?  Waterloo
2. What is your favourite genre?  Is ""excellence"" considered a genre?
3. First DVD I ever bought: I remember it clearly.  My first DVD was SNATCH waaaaay back in 2001 (or was it 2000?).  My first Blu-Ray purchase was CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND
4. My guilty pleasure movie is:   I don't typically associate guilt with pleasure.
5. My least favourite movie I own is: X-MEN: THE LAST STAND, what's wrong with me...?
6. My favourite director:  Hands down the greatest living director working today has to be Martin Scorsese, David Fincher, David Cronenberg, Terry Gilliam and Christopher Nolan.  Nobody particularly esoteric, but I mean, these dudes are famous for a reason. 
7. What I'm most proud of:  The BLADE RUNNER briefcase edition is one of the crown jewels of my collection.  Also have to mention THE EVIL DEAD Book of the Dead edition because it was hands down the single best Valentine's Day gift I ever received.
8. What I'm looking for:  I have a list the size of my... well, and anything a little off the beaten path that makes me feel a little superior when I tell my friends about it and they've never heard about it before.  Oh yeah, that's the stuff...
9. How do you organize and sort your collection:  Alphabetically, and Blu-Ray.  I think I'm getting to the point where the collection is big enough where I'm going to start organizing by director and genre, though.
10. Software/app I use to keep track:  Good old fashioned Excel spreadsheet

Most of Reddit raves about this show and I wanted to check it out. I got in to this show through Netflix instant streaming and I was generally impressed how funny it is. There's some great dialogue, except the scenarios are better written. At least personally to me it is. I did laugh through a lot of this show and there's only 6 episodes per season so you breeze through it in a weekend. The show has ended but the creator is thinking about a special in 2012.

1. The price of the Blu-rays do not increase (I mean
2. The packaging remains consistent with the current Blu-ray packaging.

However, because they will now be paying Blu-ray prices for the DVD releases of the films.

1357485916.0,1629lz,Best Buy having another Upgrade your collection event (1/13/12-2/2/12),mc2157,27,2,23,"Hi all


Best buy is having another event starting next weekend where you can trade in ANY dvd to get a $5 off coupon on any $10 bluray and up. This can even be penny dvd's from a dollar store and such

I copied the following info from a thread at cheap ass gamer (credit goes to them on this text). I hope this helps you all!

-- Limit 5 per visit. Per visit is most often interpreted as 5 per day per customer
more than 5 at a single visit as long as the store allows the exception.

-- No stacking of U&amp;S coupons. One U&amp;S Coupon
and you can't use 2 or 3 coupons on a single Bluray under any circumstance.

-- Most of the time the coupons have an expiration date co-coinciding with the last day of the program so you can't save them and use them next month.

2) Trade in DVDs do not have to be same title as Bluray. Boxsets are most often counted as 1 DVD so if you bring is a set with 4 movies in one case then you will likely be given 1 coupon and not a coupon for each disc.
If your set has for cases in a boxset, Disc 1). I've also found
that if you bring in a bunch of discs of the same season

-- If somebody pulls up a list off Google of 100 or 150 Old Blurays that are ""Only Movies Allowed"" then they are likely showing you the lists for May or October 2011 which were restricted to certain titles. The Google lists
get pulled up everytime this program is live either online or even instore -- check the dates on the list. If someone tries to tell you only same titles can be exchanged then they are incorrect. This is not the same of Selling/Trade-In
for Used Video Games and every time there are lots of people who get sent to the Video Games Department by employees thinking you are selling items. The Upgrade and Save program is separate and almost
always handled at the Customer Service Counter.

3) DVD must be a commercially produced discs (no burned copies)

4) No adult DVD that are specifically XXX content whether they are rated XXX or not.

5) Discs are supposed to have the original case and artwork and the discs are meant to be at least presentable -- the disc at least should look like it can be played. Many stores require the UPC to be intact. Some stores
check things pretty closely (right disc, disc condition) and others just toss the case into the recycle bin without any screening. In reality discs in anything that look like regular case are often accepted
by some stores including those is Blockbuster/3rd party cases with rental stickers and and nowhere near original artwork and UPC.

** Are HDDVD or HD-DVD combo packs eligible. This has been a YMMV issue and some places people have been given credit for both type discs
at all for the trade-in. If you run into this issue either try a different store or call 1-800 BESTBUY and see if they can clarify the issue for you or your Store Manager.

6) Bluray -- all current and new release Bluray priced $9.99 or above should be included. Music Blurays have been included since the April 2012 program which is different than previous sales. Preorders are not included.
Discs not in store can sometimes be ordered from BBY.com and some managers will apply a coupon to that item


7) Each store in the past had there own logistics of how to work the program. Most stores would make you stop at the entry and have your used discs stamped/marked/taped.

-- Many stores had you bring the used DVD to the Service desk
gave the customer a Copied sheet of paper with the UPC bar code and attached receipt to 'activate' the sheet of paper. The coupon could them be exchanged at the regular register for the Bluray you were purchasing and
the barcode automatically deducted the $5 at sale. This allowed you to take your coupons out of the store and purchase later. The expiration date on the official coupon is usually the last day of the sale. . If you are given
a coupon with a receipt attached do not detach them or your coupon may well be disallowed.

-- Some stores required you to bring/leave your DVD at the Customer Service desk
the discs the same day.

-- Some stores would allow you to trade your DVD for a coupon at the Service Desk
this happen once and I have no idea what would have happened if I took the coupon to a different store or brought it back to the same store later.]

8) Discounts should be taken from the actual Selling Price of the Bluray on the day of purchase despite the fine print on the coupon saying ""Discount taken from Regular Price."" This has and will likely continue to be a
contentious point until corporate absolutely clarifies the issue or changes the language. BBY ads often show discs with Sale Prices and then subtract the $5 U&amp;S coupon so logically that should apply to all other discs.


9) Price matching and also using $5 coupon is a big YMMV since this can be most certainly considered combining offers or double dipping much in the same way that PM and getting a gift card for purchase is often considered
doubling up. Since the U&amp;S is considered a Store coupon it should be applied to the price before trying to PM unlike a Manufacturers coupon (this difference is spelled out very specifically in Target and other stores coupon
use policy

10) There should be absolutely no arguments about using Reward Zone certificates during purchase.

11) Additional Manufacturers Coupons SHOULD BE allowed and should be considered the same as cash or a gift card on top of the $5 Promo. This doesn't mean it won't be argued and it certainly doesn't mean it will
be accepted

Multiple times the Best Buy Corporate Employees have had to repeat the phrase ""The store should honor the coupon
a barcode
this often ends up being decided ""Manager runs his own store in his own way"" unless it just flat out violates some policy. BBY.com community forums are the best place to take issues and often will be decided in
the customers favor with credits and RZ given to cover the missed discounts. Yelling and screaming in the store is not going to win you any arguments in store even if you are correct and will likely get security involved
and irritate everybody else in the store.

12) Buying a disc this week in hopes of applying the coupon next week will work
whether some stores will allow you to repurchase the same disc unless the store has current stock. The same can be said of ordering discs online for pick up at the store -- some stores have allowed a return/rebuy to
add the coupon and some stores have refused to do this.

13) Only USED DVD or HDDVD movies are normally allowed as trade in. . Best Buy is only supposed to accept used DVDs
refuse to accept them if they're sealed. If you find some sealed DVD cheap and bring them to the store sealed

14) Where to find cheap DVDs: If you don't have any spare DVDs laying around that you wish to part with, garage sales,
flea markets, where select DVDs can be found for 25 cents, and some titles even for 1 cent. *Disclaimer* Finding these 25/1 cent DVDs
is a YMMV situation. Some stores have them

Bringing 5 of the exact same item in for trade in -- often these cheapo discs can raise some eyebrows so if you can divide them up and bring in 5 different items it will go smoother though not to say it won't work

15) Most people have failed at trading in Blurays for coupons even if there is a DVD in the case.

16) If you have a multidisc DVD with those removable trays for extra disc
at the service desk.

17) Nobody knows exactly what happens to the old discs and cases. The official word is they are recycled at some national recycling center -- whether this means they are donated to charities for a tax deduction.

My collection isn't anywhere close to what some of you guys have but bear with me

Here it is - [My Collection](http://i.imgur.com/APN4o.jpg)

Yes I have 2 of each LotR. When I was 10 my logic was ""Why get widescreen when I can have FULL screen"" I punch myself now for that but luckily I found the extended editions on amazon for $5 a piece.

I try and buy a new DVD every time I go shopping so that I don't have to buy 10 at one time. That way I don't spend money so fast and I also have time to watch the DVDs when I buy them.

Interview thingy

1. Which state do you live? Iowa
What is your favorite genre? I have ADD so it changes a lot but if I had to pick one I would have to say Thrillers

2. First DVD I ever bought: Dude Where's my Car - I'm very proud of this. From people I've talked to it doesn't seem that popular but it is one of my all time favorite movies as well.

3. My guilty pleasure movie is: I don't really have one, and Grandma's Boy in theaters and couldn't stop laughing but all my friends hated them. Now those movies are pretty popular though. 

The opposite of this

4. My least favorite movie I own is: DareDevil - I loved it in theaters when I was around 13 but not so much anymore. Still an alright movie though.

5. My favorite director: Tough one. A tie between Christopher Nolan and David Fincher. Honorable mentions would be Darren Aronofsky

6. What I'm most proud of: Quitting pirating and starting to buy DVDs haha. If this means DVD I'm most proud of then probably Snatch. Such a great movie that mixes comedy, Brad Pitt, awesome soundtrack, and so much more. I only wish I would have heard about this movie sooner.

7. What I'm looking for: A lot yet. My pirated collection is close to 200 and I hope to get most of these movies on DVD minus a couple of them. Lately I've been looking for Salton Sea after my cousin recommended it to me. I've looked around a few Wal Marts and a few Best Buy's but I cant find it anywhere. 

8. Software/app I use to keep track: My bookshelf? I just buy DVDs and alphabetize them

I'm new here so not really sure how this works

**Plot Summary**:  
After being left in a cabin by their owner, makes it their mission to track down the man who abandoned them in this animated adventure in the vein of The Incredible Journey. Conceived by sci-fi scribe Thomas M. Disch, this unique and entertaining film has the stalwart appliances trying to survive in various unfamiliar locations. Will they make it, and will their owner welcome them back?
____
**Personal Review**:  
This film was made in 1987 by the independent studio Hyperion

Based on a book by Thomas M. Disch, Timothy Stack, [Thurl Ravenscroft](http://youtu.be/cEjZyzA-DJw) and Phil Hartman. Behind the scenes you'll get a wonderful screenplay co-written by the late, great Pixar powerhouse Joe Ranft.

The film was shown at the '88 Sundance Film Festival and earned a Grand Jury Prize nomination. According to Director Jerry Rees

The Washington Post called it **""a kid's film made without condescension""** and I couldn't agree more. This film doesn't go for laughs so much as present a journey for the characters to learn and grow.

Movie - 8/10
____
**Availability**:  
**[DVD](http://www.deepdiscount.com/dvd/The-Brave-Little-Toaster)** (use the code **25MORE** at checkout and you'll only pay $6.34 for this brand new) - Ok... the DVD is bare bones. It's unfortunate due to how amazing the film is and the wonderful people that made it. But for the price tag I'd say it's worth it.
____
**Information for Parents**:  
DVDJunky's minimum age for viewing: **4** - Appliances have (mostly) likeable personalities and they deal with abandonment. This is a journey film more than a comedy and may cause very young children to feel distressed as some of the characters are met with being dropped into waterfalls

Great for talking to your kids about working together as a team and getting along with others even when you may not see eye to eye. I also enjoyed the subtle nod to using older found items instead of buying new.

* **Violence** - This is really the only real issue with really young children watching this film (other than a child becoming frightened of your air conditioner). The things the appliances go through could be seen as somewhat frightening but in my opinion are mild.",self,t5_2sm9e,False,,family,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/dvdcollection/comments/ukt5t/reco_the_brave_little_toaster/

Ricky Gervais himself has said, you should still check it out. It is, without question, the greatest sitcom I have ever watched and one of the greatest pieces of television.

&gt;I want to do foreign films, Italy, Japan, Taiwan, China, SKorea, and Spanish cinema. For those outside the United States who wanted to know more about U.S. ""foreign"" films

**Briefly explain the history of your AOE?**

&gt;I don't know if this pertains to the actual history of foreign cinema in general, then the French New Wave 10 years later, the Cahiers du Cinema critics group headed by Andre Bazin, Truffaut, Godard (started in 1951), the Left Bank filmmakers in the late 1950s, Japanese realism in the 70s

&gt;If the question refers to my history with foreign cinema, Italian Cinema, French cinema, early cinema, and contemporary cinema. Although we watch a lot of films pertaining to these subjects, the majority of foreign cinema that I've seen owe a great deal to the textbooks I would read from.

**How do you find information about titles in your AOE?**

&gt;As mentioned above, I would learn about good foreign films from discussion with study abroad students or other cinema lovers. More recently I've been pumping through the criterion collection, which is about 95% foreign cinema.

**What is an easily-accessible title that would be a great introduction to your AOE and why?**

&gt;Crouching Tiger, with Chinese actors, spoken in Mandarin, and heavily produced by Columbia pictures - this film marked the first time that a piece of foreign cinema (without dubbing) found such a large magnitude of success in the United States. It's pretty standard Hollywood fare, but better.

**What is an easily-accessible title that you think epitomizes your AOE and why?**

&gt;I'll probably have to go with something like Seven Samurai. It's foreign, and the film has actually had a tremendous impact on the film industry - not only in the United States, but all over the world. When people think of foreign films, they think of artsy, French cinema with dialogue and plots and boring subtext. But they don't realize that films like Seven Samurai are also foreign films, and... well, it'd be hard to argue that Kurosawa's most recognizable work is a bore.

**Who are a few of the most important people in your AOE and why?**

&gt;**Akira Kurosawa;** revolutionized the samurai film as we know it, THEN think about Star Wars.

&gt;**Francois Truffaut;** cahiers critic who attacked French cinema for committing a crime of what he referred to as ""A Certain Tendency of the French Cinema""

&gt;**Jean-Pierre Melville;** A french filmmaker who was obsessed with American film noir, inspiring directors like Truffaut and Godard to make films such as The 400 Blows and Breathless.

&gt;**Hou Hsiao-Hsien;** a Taiwanese director who makes films which revolve specifically around time, a gradual disappeareance of life itself.

**What are the sub-genres of your AOE with examples?**

&gt;**Horror;** I Saw the Devil, High Tension

* Thriller; Oldboy

* Drama; Blue, Army of Shadows

* Action; Seven Samurai

* Comedy; Au Revoir Lenin!

**Roughly
&gt;80

**What kind of content do you plan on providing as an expert?**

&gt;[RECO], and maybe even try and get in on some of the netcasts and talk about foreign cinema. I'm also going to be in the chatroom a lot so people can always have a direct line to me in case there are questions and whatnot.

http://imgur.com/1xMxG

I'm one of the baristas at the VHSpresso there. The store has just under 120,000 movies but that is long gone. But during my ownership I learned of Scarecrow Video and it's legend among other indie stores. When I moved to Seattle the first thing I did was go there and try and get a job. However I was told right away they hadn't hired anyone new in years because once you get a job there you never quiet. It's cinema Heaven. So I figured I could at least start an account and show off my movie knowledge and maybe slowly work my way in.

I lost my first rental on the bus two days later.

But a few months after I then saw they were putting in a coffee cart. Having been a barista once before and figuring they'd need new people I went home

So while it is not my personal collection, it would take 164 years to watch them all there. This place is huge. It has the entire Criterion Collection, hundreds of super rare VHS, DVDs, and other treasures, and everyone who works there is very laid back and fun when it comes to talking movies. No movie snobs. 

So while my personal collection is gone, this is my collection.


1. Seattle

2. Sci Fi

3. Jurassic Park and Space Balls

4. High Fidelity

5. I saw Project X this year and wished for horrible things to happen to it.

6. Big Terry Gilliam fan but... Sam Raimi has more favorites of mine. 

7. Scarecrow had this all well

8. Nothing.

9. Old collection was alphabetical by genre. Scarecrow is the same only with about four dozen more sub genre's. 

10. Scarecrow has their own inventory/rental system. I had VMT or something back in the day. ",self,t5_2sm9e,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/dvdcollection/comments/10zgc4/i_work_at_scarecrow_video_in_seattle_wa_the/

I live in Portland

My Birthday is Nov. 24th

Choosing a favorite genre is hard for me because it really depends on my mood. I like comedies and action when i'm watching with friends

The first DVD I bought was The Iron Giant (which unfortunately was lost in the move from my childhood home.)

My guilty pleasure movie is The Parent Trap

My least favorite movie I own is Sky High

My favorite director is Steven Soderbergh

What release I'm most proud of: Back to the Future Pt.I (got it for $5 on sale at Fred Meyer

What releases I'm looking for: I have a long list. Right now I am trying to find cheap copies of Argo and The Town.

How do you organize &amp; sort your
collection? 
Right now the Bottom shelf is organized as follows(L-R):
Dark/violent movies, to comedies, to kids movies, to chick flicks, to tear jerkers.

The top shelf is organized alphabetically

If you do not ""play it forward"", from the people that started the ""chain"", because they are waiting to get two DVDs to replace the two they donated into the deal, and to this ENTIRE SUBREDDIT, because we want the logbooks as pieces of history.

I'm a Huge fan of Dead Alive's over the top ridiculousness. My good pal Disposable420 and I have been trying to get it picked as the Movie Night option since the whole thing started and it finally looks like it might actually happen.

I'm slightly concerned the turnout won't be as high as I would like so I've decided to send two lucky people Dead Alive on DVD. This may or may not be new. It will be the DVD copy. I will just be finding it online and shipping straight to you so I cannot confirm the disc condition.

I just want people to see this hilariously gory flick. A little bit about it for those of you that are in the dark:  
&gt;Dead Alive (Braindead to our foreign friends) is actually a really fun movie. It's Directed by none other than Peter Jackson (Yes
It's got a very respectable 86% freshness on rotten tomatoes and a not too shabby 7.6/10 rating on IMDb If you're a fan of Horror you should vote for Dead Alive. Fan of Comedy? Vote Dead Alive. Camp? Dead Alive. Cult? Dead Alive. Gore? Dead Alive. Peter Jackson? Dead Alive.

Alright

* I'd like to to try your hardest to *actually* show up to the movie night.

* I'd like you to not already own Dead Alive.

* Please post a picture and explanation of a film from your collection that is not known as a ""well made movie"" that you consider one of your favorites. Please include your username in the photo.

I'll pick my favorite submissions and send the DVDs ASAP.

This is all subject to change as I see fit and I will only be doing so if Dead Alive wins. Please check back for updates.

Edit: I'd like to thank everyone for their submissions!! I've been reminded of a few movies I need to buy and added a few to my watch list as well.
The randomly chosen winners are Thinandbony and ProteusFinnerty.

OK

* The shirt? Awesome. Especially the back with the quote ""It's not the size that counts

* Amelie - This is a fantastic, please watch it.

* Blue Valentine - I'm a sucker for a good romance drama. I dig The Last Kiss (The guy who did the screenplay for it also wrote Crash, and you get a before and after throughout the whole movie. It's a bit rough to watch, but it's one of my more recent favorite movies, and I'm so happy to own it.
* Chuck Season 4 - If you're subscribed to this forum
* Kill Bill - OK, as well as the same movies in a steelbook. I own the US release of Drive, the UK steelbook, and the already-out-of-print Canadian Futureshop exclusive version of Drive. Kill Bill is one of my favorite movies of all time. When I saw this steelbook was coming out, I freaked out. It's Region B locked and exclusive to Germany, but I knew I had to have it in my collection.. and now I do!!

The Kill Bill steelbooks are easily the centerpiece of my collection. The singles releases were gifted to me by someone quite special
