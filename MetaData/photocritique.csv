We can learn the most from photographs that have flaws in them

Frequently the best and most interesting critique is found on the photos that have negative votes

If you're looking for a subreddit where you can find inspirational photographs then I'd suggest you go look somewhere else

Upvoting only the pretty landscapes and other photographs that are perfectly composed and edited turns this place into just another one of the pretty photograph subreddits. It is hard to learn anything from photographs that don't have any flaws in them.
