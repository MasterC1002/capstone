As a long time player of MMORPGs I have noticed a general trend that the lifespan of MMORPGs seems to be shrinking and that MMORPG players seem to have very little faith in developers taking their games in the right direction.

I'm thinking about starting an MMORPG project with some friends(yeah I know, complexity when it comes to gameplay(most MMORPGs are very streamlined these days), and difficulty(most MMORPGs are just a walk in the park these days).

I found out earlier tonight that my father has a mass on his lung.  We're not sure what it is: it could be harmless.  Or it could be, and timid hope.  There'll be a biopsy tomorrow or early next week and then we'll know whether to panic or not.

So I came home from the hospital tonight an emotional basket-case, of course).

And when I got done,"" I didn't trudge over to /christianity to beg for prayers (though Lord knows we need them and I'll take any that are offered), and I didn't try to vomit my feelings up onto /offmychest (though I may yet do that).

Instead I came here, but I think on some level all gamers get it.  Someone comes home with this news and plays piano.  Another guy opens up an account and works all night.  Another grabs his (struggling) cat and curls up with it for a few hours.

I played the XIV beta.

And it's a fucking excellent game.  I know the real deal is still a couple months away

Let me try to paint a picture with bullet points:

* No classes or overall ""character level""
* A huge number of skills and abilities to discover
* Free-form questing: do quests and tasks when you want
* NPCs that are a little more nuanced than the usual MMO fare
* Tons of world interactions. Milk cows
* A few puzzles interspersed to keep you on your toes and your brain engaged
* A dynamic random loot generator that makes loot-finding fun
* Fates worse than death: bringing a bit of true danger back to MMOs with boss monsters that can permanently curse and transform you if you don't beat them
* No PvP (we'll later have ""opt-in"" stuff like Arenas
* NON-instanced dungeons that create a communal experience and let you cooperate and help each other in freeform ways
* Ugly-ass graphics and lots of glitches: we're an indie MMO still in pre-alpha. But it's already lots of fun

It's not even close to done yet, we could use your help playing, giving feedback, and spreading the word about the game. It's a niche game and it's been hard to get the word out about it, but we're sure there's an audience that's been waiting for just this game, with its mix of old and new MMO ideas.

Also, but if you ignore the warnings...

Actually, but you're repeatedly warned not to. Don't drink the milk, or you'll be cursed! I think the game is a little too cruel about this one right now, because players just aren't used to an MMO that has real repercussions in it. It's something we'll work on explaining better in the future.

Here is mine:

In FFXI, you know that an Elvaan black mage is not really the best idea, but I didn't know!) I went up a hill and this HUGE orc came barrelling right at me. HOLY SHIT. I could see his camp in the distance as I tried to fight him off. I got scared thinking, if I can't handle this guy out here, what is going to happen when I go in *there*? I don't even remember if I died or not just then, but I remember that feeling.
Exhiliration and excitement. Fear of the unknown. Feeling like I only had myself to depend on at that moment.


So


Why haven't I had that feeling in so long?  Times, kill stuff, sell stuff, get new gear, kill more stuff.


What is not the same is the way we go about doing these things. Used to be that there was no handholding. There was no Dulfy or ten ton hammer guides. Reviews didn't come out before the game itself. There were no wikis for every last piece pixel's worth of art in the game. Or, I just never looked hard enough.


In short


For me


We're a culture that has learned to run from one quest hub to another. We literally don't know how to entertain ourselves in between anymore.  MMOs give us


If you say, maybe MMOs are not right for you. Maybe it isn't the games that are failing you, maybe you've lost the spirit of what MMOs are. I don't want to log into a game to do a laundry list of things. I mean, I can be goal oriented, but I'm not logging in because I *want* to kill 15 spiders or bring back 10 bottles of wine to the town drunk. I am logging in because I want to explore. If these quests happen on the way, then cool.  I am looking for the larger story, but I'm not going to be ruled by these petty ass quests.


By the time a game launches, or just to extensive youtube searching. of course, no one is forcing us to read these guides or participate in betas. but we desperately want to know everything.  We're looking up stat calculators and boss encounter mechanics and just ruining our own sense of accomplishment on the way.


So


I chose Age of Conan and I went into it UTTERLY blind.  I love it. I, get ""that feeling"". It is partially because the game is somewhat low pop out in the starter zone (I think?) and I had to figure my own shit out, and partly because I got my ass handed to me a couple of times by monsters I thought I could take. But it is mostly because I know very little about the game. 


I have been taking it somewhat slow and actually letting the cutscenes build the scenarios for me.  


I like that I seem to be able to be a bit evil. And I like the fact that women run around topless. It's not a g rated game


Anyway. I just wanted to share my thoughts on ""that feeling"" I read so much about.


I know this going into a game blind doesn't work very well when you have to drop $60 on the game and maybe a sub on top of that. But


TL;DR: Got Age of Conan

I want you to think back to all of your fond memories from MMOs. They almost *all* involve TALKING and getting along with other players

This is why I think it's time that we as a subreddit did something to give us a sense of community. I have an idea

Let's, make a guild, and make friends. Let's talk to other players too, and just try to perpetuate a community outside of just ourselves. We can use this post here to upvote an MMO to play. Who's with me?

**Edit:** Alright, upvote the comment of the one you want to play. Suggestions can be b2p, f2p, or p2p, it doesn't matter. On **December 27th at 11:59 PM CST** The game with the most upvotes will be the one we will play. If you refuse to play with us simply because of the game choice, you have missed the point of this post. We are not here to find the best MMO and play it, we are here to try and start a trend of active communities in MMOs. If you do not join us

1363349410.0,1acgn1,Reddit's MMORPG (My response to what everyone contributed in my last thread),2mustange,35,7,31,"This is in response to my last thread which you can find [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/19o782/if_you_could_hypothetically_make_a_mmorpg/).

***Please share your ideas down below

This idea is to get an understanding of what people like about MMORPGs and mash them together making something incredibly enjoyable. All of which would be hypothetically done through a closed open-community project. I will refer to this game as being **RMMORPG** (Reddit-MMORPG).

**Buy To Play

**One server:**

**No Gear Grind**

**No Levels**

**Significant Skilling**

**Everything Effects Everything:** Choices must be made and choices have consequences 

**Characters:**

* **Races:**  From what I read on the thread and online races would have some variation as having ones that people have seen before and some originality to others. Races would have each have their own characteristics.

* **Classes?**:  For the majority point there is no classes but for starting sake you get a choice and upon entering the game you decide whether to stick with that class type or not. 

* **Customizing:** Everything on the character can be customized. Color and size of nearly everything. Possibly body characteristics. 


Everything within your choice would affect how NPCs and how you move within the game. You make your character fat? You will be slower. That scar on your face makes you intimidating towards certain people. 

* **Beginning Out:** After Character creation a player will be randomly placed in a random city. This will take away from having a beginners area. Each city will have roughly the same tutorial (difference will be location) and will go through all in-game content. Players will venture out to their liking and will meet people randomly. 

**Environment:**

* **Open World:**

* **Massive World Size:**

* **Dynamic Weather:**

* **Dynamic Seasons:**

* **Partially Dynamic Terrain:**

* **Cities/Towns:** Civilization will vary per area. based on the size and type of town will bring different content.

* **Realms:** This is like same concept the anime Swords Art Online had (I believe Mortal Kombat also does something like this). For everyone not familiar though the idea of having different ""zones"" to go too. The difference with this is that each Realm would be equal in size but have different content to give and NPCs could react towards you in a different way. 

**Graphics**

* **Textures:** Everyone is given their opinion. Some like realism while others like a cartoon feel.  I have came down to the conclusion that this game will have a more Realism look. 
* **Low End:** Not everyone has the best computer and in order to appeal to the majority there will be some pretty low end specs to run the game. Anything from taking particles out from lowering viewable content

* **High End:** Think of it like this...It will test the specs of a well built gaming PC. 

**Combat:**

* **Melee

**Skills(non-combat):**

* **Wide range of skills**

**Crafting system:** This needs to be unique in many ways. 

* **Specific craftable items:**

* **Random Craftable Items:**

**Karma:**

**Factions:**

**Questing:**

* **Main:** there will be more than 1 main quests all of which factor in choice made throughout the game

* **Area Based**

* **Skill Based**

* **Lore Based**

* **Voice Actors:** Gives some personality to the quests while helps those who aren't up for reading. All quests will have audio and if you aren't up for reading it or listening then skip through.  

**PVE and PVP:** From my understanding people love both concepts. So instead of having separate servers for each why not combine the two into a thrilling game. Areas will be permanent PVE while others Permanent PVP

**Wildlife (Monsters and Animals/Creatures):**

* **Hostility:** Not everything is hostile towards you but if you agitate it then it might attack you.  

* **Simple non-aggressive monsters:** These monsters can be used for practice and to gather items for skills

* **Hostile Monsters:** These are set monsters/beings which will always attack you

* **BAMs:** (Big Ass Monsters)- I know many Korean games you this as a big majority of their games to describe what is challenging but these won't be it.

* **Godlike Beings:**  Everything out there has creatures that have become into some belief that they are gods. This will be the case and these beings will be strong but not immortal when you have enough groups fighting it. 

**Dungeons**

These are what don't stay true to the open world environment. They are all based upon who enters.

* **Generating:** Some dungeons (Not all but most) will be created through some complex algorithm

* **Traps and Puzzles:** Along with monsters and bosses dungeons can hold traps and puzzles that people have to conquer in order to move through sections. 

* **Player-Creation:** This is sort of a skill based upon dungeons that have been tackled you will learn of the mechanisms used and the monsters within them. This allows for you to create your own dungeons. Dungeons can be publicized or can keep private for only friends. The dungeon lead can take on the dungeon or look over it and put given unknowns that the creator has specified for the it.  If the Creator  allows it their dungeon can be saved by other players. 


**Traveling:**  /u/gordianus1 
&gt;No fast travel
	
I agree with it actually so to add to it. Yes there will be teleportation spells  and teleportation devices. Possibly scrolls that can be found. There will be ways of getting around but simple fast travel will not be in.

**Social Groups**

* **Guilds:** just like most MMOs there will be player made guilds which will have a variety of things they can do

* **Clans:** Separate from a Guild something of which is less permanent but can be necessary.
* **Partying:** You can party with certain amount of people in order to tackle creatures and quests

**Guilds:**

* **Size:** I would love to say a guild can have as many players as possible but we all need to be realistic here and say this cannot be the case. I think a compromising size for such a game would be **500** and to start and keep a guild you can have no less than 20 people.

* **Headquarters/Housing:** Every guild needs a base. So upon entering you can buy land to build a base. Guild housing will be castle like form which comes in various sizes. The more people you have the larger your castle can be. Warning owners your castle has upkeep costs.

* **GvG:** it is only appropriate to say that this is possible then. GvG is allowed anywhere unless the area is simply a non-battle zone(PERIOD). 

* **Requirement costs:** This doesn't necessarily need to be part of a guild...but if your swordsmanship and magic aren't up to par to what the guild wants....sorry pal try again. (&lt;&lt;example)




**Chat Options**

* **Global:** This will only be allowed for subscription users in order to keep botting down while also saying  you got to pay to troll. 

* **Realm:** Given people variety...

* **Area:** this is just as blunt as can be...simply the area you inhibit at the time

* **Guild:** Since guilds will be huge this can be monitored depending how you like. For instance there will be the general guild chat but also you can make be just for higher positioned people. All depends how the owner limits it.

* **Privatizing:** This is a way to limit people into your chat. For instance a party of randoms and some guildies want to chat together or clan mates and such. OOORR this can also be used for Roleplaying. A person can set up a chat and it can be invite only or limited to a set of people. Customization is endless

* **Private Messages:**  Not exactly a chat option but more like a postage option. But if you feel the need to inform a friend of something when he/she logs on then you have that possibility. 

* **Much More:** Variety of tabs, Clan Chats. 

**Political System**

You are all thinking

* **Who you vote in:**  You are not voting in any player user. No your votes all go towards NPC of  cities. There will be maybe a hundred or so NPCs who are allowed to be voted in. Voting is all based upon the players though

* **What happens:** Simply each NPC will choose how the taxes  are laid out. No one will know for sure but based upon how the NPC acts there will be a general concept of how they would rule to be formed. 

* **Crime:** These also affect crime rates. NPC crime and Player crime and depending on who is in charge will affect how guards react. 

* **Over-time:** A NPC can be ruled in as much as the community does so but this also affects how they rule. 

* **Corruption:** It is possible a guild could have control of the political system in an area. It is also possible to buy out a ruler to end its term or possibly let your criminal sentence slide. 


**Bonus Content:** This is stuff I believe can be added to make the game be more social while also putting friendly quirks in there too.

* **Card Game:** Not all of us like card games but there are many that do. Why not add this into the mix. Playing the game collecting cards. Building up decks. Why not right?

* **Mini-Games:** I honestly do not have much examples for this other than Runescape. People like to have fun and these could change it up a bit

* **Gambling Games:** Not all of us like trying to break markets and build money from doing so

**Mobile Application**

Depending on where your character is will depend on how much you get to work your app.

If you are in the city you will get access to surrounding market content while also being able to get to city min-games. If you are in a small town you get access to content based on that town: this can be specific town driven content or maybe lore about the town itself

If you are in your house

Mini-game content- If you leave for a bathroom break never feel bad about having the other person wait!

There is always the ability to access guild/clan/party and private chats with it. Even private messages.

Star Wars Galaxies was a popular MMO when it was released, guilds and completely open planets and space.

SWG was a successful sandbox game with a thriving community, and decided to take some elements (Like a level system) and implement them into SWG, which basically alienated the previously loyal user base.

The Emulator project, to give players a truly sandbox Star Wars esque game to play on. With the recent release of SWOTOR, and its linear storyline, some Star Wars fans ache for the good old days when they could just go out in the wilderness, explore, set up a camp and play a tune.

The Emulator project is in its Beta phase, you can buy old copies of SWG on Amazon, however there are many other ways of acquiring it.

Costs are a factor -- my students are going to be required to purchase several games, for instance, but wonder whether we'd get much out of the game in such short time). On the other hand, if I can choose a free-to-play game that is worth our time, all the better (as this would let us play the game casually throughout the semester rather than concentrating our time all at once).

Some other considerations: we're only going to play one MMORPG together as a class, I also want it to be worthwhile in its own right (especially for low-level players -- we won't be playing long enough to get very good at it). The class is equally split between men and women, so I do want something that will appeal to both genders if possible. And, since the majority of students will not be MMO veterans (and in some cases, have little gaming experience at all), I want something that will be accessible to noobs.

Thanks!

EDIT: I neglected to mention technical issues: I *should* choose a game that's available for both Windows and Mac, as many of them won't have high-end rigs. We spend two hours each week in a computer lab, so we will be playing a little on better machines, but for playing at home, it shouldn't be too demanding.",,False,t5_2qlxw,True

Now to explain more

I've played through some of the betas (have been burnt out in MMO Beta testing before, because financially other things came up.  I was surprised that I got an e-mail saying I would have early access, which that was pretty cool.

I'm not level cap yet, doing the scheduled events (i.e. AD bonus from skirmishes), praying hourly, and sending companions out on leadership missions.  And I've only put roughly 24 hours into the game.  I can only imagine what it'll be like at 60.  If you look at the game as ""you must pay to get things"", then yeah, it'll be pay-to-win.  But it is so incredibly easy to save up AD and buy Zen.  If the market changes, that'll be one thing, as it stands right now, that doesn't sound very pay-to-win to me.

I'm sure there are those who disagree with me, why do you care?  People could do that in WoW, just through third party companies (and I know quite a lot of people who took advantage of it) while BUYING the game and then paying a subscription.  

It happened in Diablo 2

A lot of people will point at Guild Wars 2, and had a blast throughout it.  But when I got to the end game, I couldn't stand it.  I had spent $60 on this game, played through the content to finally hit 80, and I could not enjoy the endgame almost at all.  I was pretty frustrated, and was out $60.  And while they release content now, they will be releasing an expansion, and doesn't require you to spend a cent.  Some players will want to take advantage of the Microtransaction store, or they'll look for some third party to pay off and do the work for them.  Either way, we'll legitimize it"" and gets rid of a middle man

I'm not fanboying (if this were Wildstar, and this one seems to be incredibly balanced, especially compared to what is out there.

I'll probably receive a lot of hate, it's pretty easy to see balance.  If you get upset, because someone bought some sword, then you should avoid MMO's, because it happens everywhere.

When I played WoW for the first time in 2004

I have this home-made hypothesis, and the feeling can never be achieved again. Not in an expansion, and not in another MMORPG.

I'm curious if I'm wrong or right (or something inbetween).

Do you think it can be felt more than once? Have you felt it twice? Was that in two different MMORPGs? Was it after a long break?

Personally I think/guess playing has a disillusionising effect. Similar to how it's difficult to start believing in Santa again. It becomes impossible to pull the curtain in front of your eyes.

Why do I ask this? I think some players link this positive feeling to vanilla WoW

I want to find a new mmo to play because I love hobby games with rewards and feeling like you've done cool things with the trophies to show it. The hard part is that none of the current mmo choices are fitting the bill. I might just have unrealistic expectations. I'm not sure


1. I'm done playing wow. I have been on it since vanilla and basically quit in the beginning of cata. Now the numbers are too large to even matter. Bosses with 1 trillion hp?


1. The Secret World seems like a really great idea. The whole theme of it. I'm into it. The issue for me is the gameplay. The system of building any way you want. Not really. A lot of the skills are hokey. The combat is stiff and the UI bothers my eyes.


3. Guild Wars 2 was probably my largest heartbreak. I followed it as early as I could. It was amazing. The quests were going to be fun. The game was designed for pvp. What I ended up seeing was a mmo fashion show. The end game is pointless. The PvE fights are large clusterfucks. There are things to do but everything is so grind-y(?). WvWvW doesn't interest me at all. All it is is zerging. The traits aren't balanced well in my opinion either.


4. Star Wars The Old Republic was a great idea butchered. The one class I was interested in playing was the scoundrel and the cover system made me want to kill myself. It was okay for pve and in pvp it made you a sitting duck. Now it's free to play. There is now basically no gate to remove the casuals from those who actually wanted to be objective. At least be pay to play so people can't just spam accounts.


5. Rift interested me. It was neat that you basically pick the archetype you like. From there you have a variety of play styles to choose from. Neat. Barely has a community. Also


6. Never touched TERA. An fpsmmo didn't sound appealing.


7. Defiance was a gimmick game. Didn't take off as I expected. On steam it has less people playing than that Warframe game.


8. Path of Exile doesn't have an end game. It's basically Diablo that you start over and over with different build ideas. The racing part seemed comical.

In Development/beta there are a few games I'm hopeful for. Neverwinter seems okay. I like the idea of player created content. If actually moderated it will be a source of infinite content. However

All this is pretty much why I can't settle in on an mmo. I like bits and pieces from all of them but none of them make me want to play.",self,t5_2qlxw,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dqyzp/hard_to_settle_into_one_mmorpg/

I've been on a brake from mmorpgs for a few months and i'm looking for a new heavily focused pvp game to play on. 

I can spend 15h+ a week gaming

Here's an exhaustive list of MMOs i've already tried/played:

*WoW (full season 2 glad when i sold my account

Knight online (played a few years before wow

Guild wars 2 (got 2 80s but i find the pvp very boring and linear; people mostly have the same gear and hardcore gamers barely get rewarded)

Champions Online (got a few characters at max level)

Bloodlines champions (played almost every day for a few weeks)

LoL (full 2009 year)

Hon (almost a year)

Diablo3

PoE

Age of conan (played a week 2 years ago)

Lineage 2 

Tera (only played at very low levels so far)

Eve online

DayZ

WarZ

There are a few games coming out this year that i'm closely watching (archeage, i don't know which game to play.

DCUO, Tera, Rift, WoW, Planteside2, and Diablo 3. I have different friends that play each one. I have at least one max character in all the games, but usually a lot of alts too. Especially WoW

My problem is this: After all this time, just can't seem to suck me in.

I feel guilty when I ""Should be playing XXX"" to do the daily/weekly or whatever

Take WoW, because of the efficiency provided from the XP boost, but instead I just bummed around on Tera. I couldn't be bothered playing WoW, I'm over it, but at the same time I can't let go because I've done it for so long.

Moreso, so when I do I want to be making the most of it. 

I can't play single player games at all anymore because they don't have the same sense of acheivement that MMO's do.

Then I've been thinking

Me, not only did I have to keep up with healing, there's also tons of debuffs I had to get rid of. So I was constantly on my toes healing and removing debuffs. I'm, what you would call a healbot. I have a bad habit of, if there is nothing to heal, just sit there. Iris Online helped me keep up my healbot habits, ahah

I also recall having a lot of fun playing the healer in Dragon Saga/Dragonica

As for hated healing, the name has slipped my mind, all I remember about it was that there was a system where you could make your own dance emotes. But yes, that game, I've never felt so useless as a healer. My heals did nearly nothing, and my party members kept dying, they had to use potions themselves, and this is at a dungeon that everyone my level was going to! Not sure if that was only because it was still early game but I hated feeling useless. Plus I did poop damage so I couldn't contribute much.

There's plenty of franchises out there that have the expanded universe that a great MMO needs, I doubt it'll be as pure as Vanilla/BC.

So, and that he no longer needed the one I sold to him, and he was giving me back. After I said that he should just deleted both, he said he was giving it back to me anyways, and that I shouldn't delete it, if for nothing else, for the memory.


It touched me a lot, a mmorpg character - Yes I had lots of fun playing it , I met lots and lots of cool, honest, warming people. One of the funniest and coolest person I've ever met til this very day, I met  playing that game in that exact character. But, this wasn't just a regular character. 

You see, and I knew so little about this game. The forums didn't help much, because they didn't have much to teach you.


So I tried messaging some of the higher levels and tried to talk to them. All of them ignored me until I was about level 60 http://imageshack.us/a/img545/6269/arvores.png  and already knew a LOT about the game (the highest level at the time was 100+-) and was actually teaching them

So, to see what they had to teach me, for my surprise this game didn't 'exist' in a english version. So I tried looking for other versions of it, I don't remember how, but I end up finding 2 things. First a Chinese Version and second a Vietnamise version. The name of the game, in both version were Fun City (different from the brazilian one) and I used google to translate their forum to english and found the Tutorial/Guides section of their forums. I msg'd some random people asking for help (everything in english) and gave them my MSN. A chinese guy actually asnwered me, and he said I should add him in Skype and we both should talk (you see I can write just fine in english, I've a hard time speaking english

http://imageshack.us/a/img132/1063/dragonkk.jpg

He ended up teaching every little thing I had to know about the game... He taught me how to make lots of money without the need to buy Cash, how to equip myself (you see, this was a very 'poor' graphically game, but it was full of amazing things and secrets). He taught almost everything there was to know about my class, and he did it patiently (most of the time) and I'm very grateful to him to this very day. He even lend me one of his char, so I could login and play with him ( a level 100 char ) .

Some time passed, fight with us later and bla bla bla) we help her out, she gets about the same level as us, but she is this manipulative *****. 

Anyways, and we decided to quit - 3 of us quit in the same day. Said good by in the forums, people cried, some said we were bluffing. In the end that was it. Legacy was over - We had no other reason to keep playing, it was a waste of time (and money for some of us) because we were the best, we knew all the secrets, we had won so many battle, while people were playing for a year or more) and so intense that it didn't matter anymore.

Well, tibia, wow, etc, etc) but I never had really teach a lot. This time it was going to be different, I had shared a lot, taught a lot, and was in love with the girl and Yadda yadda yadda - he was the scared one anyways

Well

In the end, my first mmorpg and I had a great time there. And this time (about 2 years ago) I had the change to meet all thoose awesome people, make awesome friends who I want to meet in real life, made a lot of fights and wars, and laughed so fucking much...

I just had to share it here, it doesn't matter how much we fight and make war, there is a respect and almost a friendship with the people we make war. Because we DON'T hate them, we just have to fight to defend our interest, but it really doesn't matter in the end because it's just a GAME and everything end ups being good memories... I know this because that is how I feel about everyone I met, friend or foe, and I talked with thoose people sometime later and they all had good memories of our wars and battles...

Have Fun Guys and I hope you like it.

http://spaceblasterx.blogspot.com/2013/02/why-i-will-never-buy-nexon-credit-again.html

**Why I won't buy NX Credit ever again:**


You would think that in the era of Free to Play games


I recently started playing Dragon Nest because I wanted a game to have fun with friends by running around bashing stuff in the face.  Simple.  And I personally have no problem chipping in a few bucks here and there for F2P games for some of the vanity stuff or bag upgrades and whatnot.  I understand it takes money to run the game and have no problem with the F2P model in general.


So


In the game you get a starter package for your character


Although I didn't read it all the way through, it shows the discount with the NX icon and the remaining NX after the discount.  So it seems that if I buy the NX currency, then it wouldn't necessarily be credit.  After checking out the pricing I see that, Hey I could buy both discounted items for 5$.  Neat!  And I thought that this is a good way to get your players spending the in game currency by giving them some limited time discounts.  Good marketing, or so I thought.


So I buy the NX Credit, that only NX Prepaid, which I had no idea what that was, could be used to buy the discounted items.  Yes it says you cannot use NX Credit, but that makes no sense and I bought the currency and thought that 'Credit' meant you could charge it and pay it later.


So I'm like


This system is a load of jack.  I may play their game still, make it quick and easy to just enter your card and get what you want, but instead, they make the system confusing and a pain in the ass.


Maybe I'm just cranky since I just got off work


If you guys are planning on playing a Nexon game, please get better marketing guys, if it pisses me off, I'm sure it's gonna piss a lot more people off as well.  (I'm generally a pretty passive and forgiving person with this kind of stuff).

There are also a massive number of buffs in the game, accepting buffs a level or two lower than max

They even made the system even crazier later on with tinkering, and add certain buffs and abilities you couldn't get otherwise.

I've spent the last few years making prototypes and small burner projects to understand the concept of network programming. About a year ago I felt I was comfortable enough to build an entire experience out of it and started on what is now the Noble's Land project.

At this point it's a seven program project

* Game Client
* Game Server
* Resource Editor
* World Editor
* Publisher Tool
* Launcher
* Website

I've started doing videos recently to get the hang of it while it's still early along

As for the game design I am taking what I loved about older games from my childhood and applying newer technology and design behind it. 

* Backpacks are free placing
* No hotbars
* Always on PVP
* When a player is killed in pvp they drop their current backpack and one piece of equipped gear
* No paperdolling (NO RAINDOW ARMYS). When you make your character you pick your starting class. You have an idle style based on your current class. When you wear a full matching set you become a subclass which will change your appearance to others. For example

* Instead of hundreds of generic items I plan on having one set of armor per class per skill range. This way when you see someone appear on your screen you know what they can do or what they have attached. So lets say lvl 1-10 is rank 1 set, rank 2, and rank 3 you would be the rank 1 subclass. If you had a mixed set of rank 2 and rank 3 gear, you would be rank 2 subclass. I hope that makes sense. You can get a sense of their strength at first glance, but they could have mixed armor so you can't always be sure. You can ctrl + click the player and it will open a Player Identify window which will show you what pieces they have on. The idea is that players will look at each item in the game like symbols instead of generic number raising junk you swop out every half hour.
* No Auction Houses
* No Player Levels but Skill Levels
* Land Rental: You can't place houses anywhere in the wild. You can rent houses in cities. There are also a handful of lots in secluded places around the world where you can build your own buildings. This way the thought and design I put into the map wont be ruined by random houses all over the place.
* Land mounts and boats
* Law system: bad actions like killing others unprovoked, those who commit crimes become red. You can potentially be sent to jail (sort of a punishment, but there is also content there you can enjoy but still in isolation).
* Unique lore and design aka non-Tolkien based. No Orcs

So yea, Twitter, RSS.... I have a subreddit if that's your thing too. There is also a Developer Blog on the homepage. I try and spread it around enough so you can get news whichever way you prefer. You can get links to everything on the menu bar on [NoblesLand.com](http://NoblesLand.com)

F2P business model and pricing structure has seen significant success in other games: Especial egs such as Team Fortress 2 and
League Of Legends: Both Commercial and Player satisfaction. Why is this?

More than a few indications suggest that F2P is growing and already is the dominant revenue model in MMORPGs; a quick search reveals some strong claims to this view:

2. [Wargaming.net: F2P Is The Future for ALL Gaming](http://www.gamefront.com/e3-2012-wargaming-net-f2p-is-the-future-for-all-gaming/)

&gt;""“Absolutely, even your cell phone, barring some minor down payments, is free, so yes — it’s the future for all kinds of gaming. The box — retail — will not survive. Downloads for money will not survive. Because of piracy, because there’s so much… Quality. If you look at games coming out of China, you see multi-million dollar budget games that are improved upon every month after launch

&gt;“So yes, quality games. In the past two years, the market of global online games has grown like crazy, and we’re part of this growth.”

**Arbitrary Best F2P MMO List**

A quick and dirty search for the quality of F2P titles (also includes ""reformed P2P"" mmorpgs) does not necessarily reveal that F2P makes a game any better than a P2P and it's open to question if F2P ends up being cheaper also. Additionally there are volumes of F2P mmorpgs that give F2P a very bad name.

To answer some of these questions I've added some very insightful and comprehensive articles on F2P in mmorpgs and games in general:

1) Is F2P the future?
2) How does F2P affect the design of mmorpgs?
3) Will F2P lead to spending less or more by players?
4) Is there still a future for sub-based mmorpgs?
5) How does F2P relate to virtual or simulated game economies?

... and many more questions:

Wildstar simply put just feels like WoW's successor. The devs are promoting this game saying it's made for hardcore players. That appeals to me see as how most mmo content feels rather rinse and repeat. This is possible because of they way they are doing combat. High mobility and those markers on the ground. Much more activity.

FFXIV:ARR seems to be more of a hobby game. I'm in love with the ability to change classes on one character and that the professions are classes themselves.

1345043601.0,y9iqb,MMO's Gone Soft,CarbonExtreme,26,10,34,"When I hear new gamers

I’ve been one of those players fortunate enough to see the evolution of these games from the get go. I’m not talking about WoW being someone’s first MMO

Content and levels are faster becoming increasing easier to acquire. Gear less important and certainly less unique.  I can’t remember the last time I was standing next to a player (in any game) and envied his/her appearance knowing exactly what an item was he/she was wearing solely by their appearance.  No inspection necessary. Most appearance items of today are bought from a market and hardly resemble the item being worn. 

I remember the days of Epics and how unique each and every weapon and armor set was. I remember the Coldain War where hundreds of players (most complete strangers) united together to assist in a zonewide PVE event for a single item!   An event with hundreds of NPCs and complex storylines.  I remember Dragons Wandering the land challenging players of all levels to keep a watchful eye on the horizon where any zone could be dangerous regardless of level. Even mobs were unique

I remember when there was no market place and you had to earn “run speed”. I remember when experience potions were a rare reward (like a 5 years Veteran reward) instead of $5 in the marketplace.

Worlds have become easier to navigate, raids irrelevant.  You can even buy in game currency directly from the game developers!! 

Once familiar terms like Quad Kiting or Swarm Kiting are near dead. Rare spawns and “rare drops” less and less meaningful with each new release as game developers work harder and harder to appeal to the masses. 

While I’m a HUGE fan of graphics and game improvement
In a recent (but brief) conversation I had with Brad McQuaid we expressed similar interests

While I’m no doubt expecting the vast majority of players reading this to shrug in disbelief, waiting for the return of the MMO.

From playing various mmorpgs in recent years I have noticed a rather jarring trend. Generally the larger and more successful guilds and players will get to end level and start taking on the end game content. Now this content may start off imbalanced and difficult and will cause a few to complain. The developers will then proceed to drop the difficulty somewhat

These people eventually get bored of running the same content again as there is no challenge and since they are decked out in all the gear you could dream of they have no incentive and leave.

Now ""back in the day"" of vanilla/tbc wow, there were plenty of casual players and the numbers ever increased. Now, many players weren't able to meet the demands of the higher guilds at the time, but the numbers still rose.

Is it because there just wasn't much choice back then and wow came at the right time or will casuals still play even if there is content they just can't access unless they put more time in?

This was pretty much my first MMORPG. I remember sitting in Draynor chopping on willows trying to get 99 woodcutting.

 That game kept me entertaining and playing the longest of any MMORPG game to date. Maybe this was just because I had real life friends playing or something I don't know. The game was just sort of simple but had tons to do and somehow chopping trees all day didn't seem boring at all. The bots were probably the main reason I quit. Everyone was so rich it didn't seem like I could compete by playing normally. 

Is there any sort of game that will emulate this feeling that is newer and better perhaps? It doesn't have to have terrible graphics it just needs to be somewhat similar. I bought GW2 and it really didn't do much for me. It seemed like a grind to me and the community was friendly enough

Anyways, better quality overall. I am just not ever feeling happy with an MMORPG lately and want to bring that old feeling back.

I would greatly appreciate any suggestions. Who knows maybe I should just start another Runescape account? Does anyone here play anymore? I know it sort of started to go downhill after the wilderness died and the GE and whatnot

I had shied away from the game on its NA Release because of words like *""Korean grind-fest, Elins""*. 

Also

There are plenty of reviews out there on Tera

&gt;I seriously think I would fall over dead if anybody writing at MMORPG ever actually got to cap in this game instead of taking screenshots of the starter zone and calling it a day.  A few points I'd add as a vet player:

&gt; 1)  The game's hard.  It starts out easy and gets progressively more difficult with a steep curve about halfway through leveling.  If you're not leveling a Berzerker, and use good crystals.  You can die while leveling, which is something that's been removed from WoW and its clones.

&gt; 2)  The only people who think Isle of Dawn is breathtaking are people who have not seen the rest of the game.  Isle is mindblowing coming fresh from uglier games, Scythra Fae, Tirkai Forest, Fountain of Shara, Bastion and Baldur's Temple, etc.  If you can run it on max, there's very little that touches it.

&gt; 3)  The armor and weapon designs are all race, the design is completely different than on a high elf female.  You can also dye every piece of armor in the game using custom RBG/brightness sliders.  There are dozens of armor designs per race/gender/class, and every single one is usable to remodel gear while leveling.  So I disagree very much that everybody looks the same within a race/gender/armor type.  There will be overlap no matter what, but there's a lot of customization here, including re-usable costume and accessory slots. 

&gt; 4)  You haven't truly experienced Tera's combat until you've stepped into a hard mode.  Most of the bosses have relatively simple mechanics that are, fast monster that wants you to die.  There's no global CD to stare at, there's no skill in the game that's spammable, and there's no set rotation.  You use skills based on priority, situation, and cooldowns.  The starter zone only gives a tiny, tiny taste of what the actual endgame is like.

The game is beautiful, each character class will gain a large number of skills and abilities while leveling in addition to custom Glyph builds to further use for specialization.

It's free, don't be thrown off because it isn't like every other MMO out there. Oh, it's a theme-park ride, for sure, but with some really nice differences. Fact: No one complains about lack of content in Tera, too much content maybe, but not a ""lack there of"".

Neither of us wants to play another point and click game. So that really doesn't leave us that many options.

I already have GW2 but he's not interested so it's not an option. We've both tried Vindictus and we're not big fans of it.

I would appreciate recomendations of games with a decent player base

PS: We're from Europe.

EDIT: Here's a small list of what we've already tried

Some of the games we play(ed) (and at least one of us enjoyed):

Dragon Nest

S4 League

Guild Wars 2 (but he's not interested in spending money right now)

Grand Chase (just me)

C9 (Just me)

Games we're currently waiting for:

Phantasy Star Online 2

HeroesGo

Onigiri

Games we're considering trying but not too sure:

Tera

1370473889.0,1fr5ty,Some elements I would like to see in future MMOs,mahlzeitcompany,23,9,25,"I was looking for some decent MMOS to play, after that it just went down for me. I tried out Rift

This is my personal opinion, please feel with me.


* Decent Talent trees

My favourite talent trees were in Vanilla WoW. You got one point each level

* Classes need to have clear differences

Rift for example. Only 4 classes? Okay. What? Every class is like 4 classes, souls. So I spend 5 points in a tree, giving me passively 1% damage increase per point, I can skill new abilities and effects. BUT ALSO I get abilities and effects based on the amount of points i spend on the tree passively. This just blows my head. I can play rogue as melee, as ranged, as spell ranged, as damage heal support, not all of them. 


* No automatic teleport INTO the dungeons. 

I would like to see where the hell I am. What's wrong with two people going to the place and teleport me in front of the door

* Limited amount of currencies. 

I don't want millions of coins, sigils or whatever to buy some gear during leveling. I'm learing to play the game and now you want me to figure out where I can get what gear at which price for which level. Keep it to a human amount so that everbody understands what it's for, so people with less time can also get some good gear. But keep it until max level, please.

* Subscription. 

Make it 2, no need to pay for getting advantages.

* Limited instant teleports to certain places. 

If I want to get from A to B

* Two dungeon modes

One easy AoE-through mode for leveling


* One Bag Window. Why do I need to click on 4 different bags?

* Adequate transition between main game and addons. Having 200000 hitpoints is just absurd.

* Crafting needs to have personal benefits.

* Level description for zones/territories.



Feel free to add.

We were playing ""Sandbox"" MMOs before it became the buzzword it is today. I started playing this genre with Everquest: Online Adventures. Yes

Does anyone else sit back while playing the ""MMO of the Month"" (last month was Guild Wars 2) and think, but it's still the same as &lt;GAME&gt;."" The industry changed when WoW released. Packaged content, released at regular intervals, with tiered progression ensured the ""majority"" of players will stay hooked forever and was so successful. Thus, the ""themepark"" was created. Developers jumped from being innovative to trying to recreate the magic. 

The simple fact the phrase ""WoW-Clone"" is a pejorative shows the industry again is in flux. Themeparks bad

I hope one of these crowdfunded games become a hit and we can return to golden age of MMOs

* Larger maps with more details. I thought of a HD Skyrim looking world with large maps/dungeons. With the larger maps however i feel some would want a way to quickly travels still so maybe a vehicle or TP Ports?
* No level system but a skill system. Possibly with trainers and practice? This would encourage more play time to work on your skills in the game and could help with the better combat system. 
*Sandbox! The only problem that I would see encountering is people who would try to loot banks and other people more then just to play the game. I do want items to have some kind of security for the inventory
* Crafting mini-games and less drops. It would encourage a strong economy and player enjoyment. It would take out a large part of wanting to fight bosses however
* Clans are what your character is born into, EVER.
* More Mods? It would be costly... Has there ever been an in game report button? I am fairly new to MMORPG's and I haven't seen anything like and in game report button. Also if that is abused
* More Character customization / Import a photo and the game will try create a digital character like that?
* Combat can come from anywhere at anytime. So you can fight and kill anyone at anytime
* Many random Unique items that travel around. So maybe a pet that follows you around for a while
* Servers. I saved this for last because I have an idea. When you first start out in the game you create a character. After all the face and body details you put in you choose what clan you want to be apart of. Each clan would have its own server/ starting area. After the getting to know the game phase, and add a chat that travels though all of them. I think this would be EXTREMELY costly however. 


ORIGINAL : Sorry about the read but what do you think are some good aspects of one and ideas to improve on some of the ones I have?

* Good combat system
* I want a market system that can be controlled by players or guilds. If you want what the NPC does like as a black smith or something you can buy out his company and do what you wish with it. You can keep it as a black smiths or change it to a home, a storage space, ANYTHING. But it can also be bought out from you, broken into, destroyed. 
* Lots of NPC's and social aspects 
* Mix of Past
* Not Pay to win but you can buy items and clothes that have no extra stats and available for free in game money
* True open world. I want no area that goes ""you can not pass though this area."" If there is a door you can break it down. If there is a mountain you can try to scale it. If there is a wall you can try to break it. If it has ledges you can try to grab them. 
* Clans and guilds.  I want guilds and clans. I want to be able to create new towns and destroy others.  I want to build a world that begins in order and based on the decisions of the people playing the game... it may become anarchy.
* I want you to be able to make one Character and only this one. If you die you are moved to another world (these will be like servers) and cannot return to a previous one (well maybe). And the skill tree you choose can be changed or expanded into any of the others.
* I want no limitations based on your skill levels. If you try and fail
* A crafting system that is easy to understand and work with
* A strong story line that encourages PVP and PVE interactions
* Good graphics and environmental settings

After years and years of waiting for some of these titles and being completely bored

**SWTOR**
Technically this came out in late 2011, and a lot of loading screens (thank you Hero engine). Quit cold turkey after beating the end game raids on normal mode and haven't missed it one bit.

**Tera**
This was my hopes and dreams. Action combat with scantily clad females? Hell yes. I have no idea why

**Diablo 3**
Not considered a MMORPG by most, where I login randomly throughout the years.

**Guild Wars 2**
Yeah, SPVP, and I've done things like crafting, gathering, and map completion on the PVE side, but really, the game doesn't seem innovative at all and it's having a hard time holding my interest. I'm forcing myself to login at this point.

I didn't try it

The only other release I might try this year is Firefall (if it even gets released this year?). MoP is definitely a no, definitely wrong.

Welcome tothe firsteditionof the Warhammer40

First of all

We consider this to be YOUR game – the online 40k world that the fans have always wanted. To that end

In the months to come, I’d like to say a bit more about the game itself.

A World At War

One of the first misconceptions we saw about the game based on the announcement was that because of the game’s genre

In Eternal Crusade, you’ll have a great overview of the ongoing conflict due to both traditional UI elements and community channels. If you want to head to the front lines and fight where you’re needed most, you can drive over there and do so. Along the way you might meet players from the enemy faction skulking about, or maybe you’ll spot a tantalizing entrance to the world beneath the surface or a Tyranid infestation bursting out near one of your strongholds.

Or perhaps one of your squad-mates will get an idea to hit the enemy behind their lines at a particularly valuable strategic position. It’ll take some skill to get there unnoticed and you might be guaranteed to have the enemy’s attention once you’ve done the damage

Part of what makes this possible is that MMO technology has come far enough to allow for true skill &amp; precision-based gameplay and we’ve made a deliberate choice to make progression as horizontal as possible. A small amount of power gain is inevitable

The other part is that we’re not creating a ""content-heavy"" world, but community efforts and Tyranid invasions drive the battle for the surface while the shapes and challenges of the underworld are generated procedurally. Our aim is to make an online world that never stops being able to surprise its players.

If this sounds good to you, you can encourage them to register on the site.

Until next time

I enjoy games during the leveling phase, it's an huge time sink and, more often than not, you come out empty handed. It's an endless grind where there's always some better piece of gear to get, and when there isn't, you can be sure the next patch or expansion is going to void all your work so far, and you get to grind all over again.

Besides the time factor, move, kite, avoid the goo on the ground, focus heal at certain points... I know not everything can be tank &amp; spank, but some games take it too much to the extreme. You can't just jump into a dungeon and do your thing nowadays: you've got to study the strategies beforehand on a wiki or what have you, otherwise you risk causing wipes. It gets better after a few runs of the same dungeons, it represents a great barrier to entry.

Basically, but I'd just like an alternative to raiding.

Do you think we will see some other forms of endgame in the future?

I had a few misconceptions. :)

1. At first I thought the NPCs standing outside of player houses were the Avatars of those players who had logged out.

2. The instruction manual that came with Renaissance was actually out of date. Unknown to me at the time

 I remember reading how the world was a dangerous place and that I should find refuge as soon as possible. I remember making my first trip to West Britain Bank full of trepidation. :) I was actually perfectly safe.

It is hard for a company to truly nail a pirate themed game (just because it is difficult to get the mood right). For example

I think MMOs with a pirate theme should take a page out of **Sid Meier's: Pirates!** It really captured the mood of a pirate game in my opinion. You could reap the spoils of your victims and choose what to take and what not to, I sailed to the town with the best market prices. It's the little things that really make games like these, the fine details. Another example is dancing with the governors daughter to get some cool gear. Or sacking a city just because you don't like the fat governor. MMOs developers need to understand it's not just about quests and gold.

Some Positives:
-Graphics.  They're not as nice as everyone has been making them out to be in my opinion.  However I'm going to guess that people have been making this claim based on the graphics of many other MMOs

-Character creation. I'm really impressed.  Very thorough.  Makes me feel like my toon is actually unique.

-Environments.  They're pretty immersive.  I would have liked to see a little more open-worldness to them for the starter areas

-Options.  Many races


Some things that didn't initially impress me:

-UI  It's so polished to the point where, but it's not particularly speedy where I can get the info I need really quickly and keep doing my thing.  Kinda clunky, would prefer something light and simple.

-Voice acting. Meh.

-New player guidance.  I could have used a little more aid in terms of what I'm supposed to be doing at any given point in time.  This wasn't terrible


Overall the game seems great so far!  The other people running around in the newbie areas were friendly and helpful.  I definitely plan to pick up this game at some point in the future.

We've played many of the big ones over time and it seems like the latest few released have had a very ""flavor of the month"" feel to them.  There is also a trend toward eliminating the ""holy trinity

Guild Wars 2 is a fantastic game.  Their pricing model, and crafting are really well executed.  However, the group/dungeon mechanic is awful.  By eliminating the typical class roles, the dungeons feel more like a co-op single player affair rather than an MMO.  This alone ruined the game for me and my friends.  In  fact, the people I know who enjoy dungeons in GW2 only enjoy them because they've figured out some way to mimic the Trinity (""If you play guardian right you can pretty much tank"" etc).

I've come to the conclusion that the trinity isn't part of the game - it IS the game.  When we play MMORPGs, or the future, the MMORPG may look and act any number of ways.  However, to eliminate the Trinity is to change the nature of the game.

Having to specialize and depend on group members is what creates the MMO experience.  It also creates the community.  If you're a dps

How much more entertaining and rewarding would it be if the players where the ones creating the side quests
The reward could be of their choosing. I have not quite thought out how exactly to work this
This would give the possibility of endless amounts of side quests as it could range from bounties on peoples heads (if say you had a law system in the game) to simply protection for travel or even possibly clearing out basements or courtyards of creatures of a higher leveled players house/refuge etc.
If you could somehow make this system work that lower leveled players could 'hire' higher leveled players with a worthwhile reward for the higher leveled players then everyone would win.
Of course there would also be other npc quests such as main quests
I believe this would create more incentive to complete these side quests as you would be doing favors for other players and possibly even creating relationships

Would like to hear thoughts and feedback on this idea even the bad. Though this is just an idea im putting out there not even sure how it would work exactly.",self,t5_2qlxw,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1exyxj/what_if_players_could_create_the_side_quests_for/

I tried Eve Online. While it seems to have a great focus on community

I've never played Minecraft, if it offers what I want.

So

- Has no Dungeon-Finder.
- Has people socializing with randoms while questing/grouping (i.e. the MMO should let me make friends easily even without joining a guild).
- Is not too heavily affected by latency (I will almost certainly have ~200 latency on Eu servers, even with ~700ms latency).

Later I decided to check out some streams of the higher levels and see what it was like. It was more of the same and I asked a couple of the streamers if the game was as linear as it seems and they said yes.

From what I have seen

I had high hopes for the game and even an initial feeling of enjoyment but I just don't think it will be for me. But if you are looking for a theme park game with a neat combat system and instanced areas this could be the game for you.

After being in a very successful raidng guild in WoW for a long time I stopped playing a year ago and haven't touched it since. It just wasn't exciting anymore and felt too much like ""work"" and also I didn't have so much time for it anymore because of my job.

I tried a lot of different games after that: Diablo 3 (no mmo...), Defiance (shooter ...) and a lot of other coop and versus multiplayer games with some friends really, but nothing kept us playing for very long.

1366324880.0,1cn08m,The End vs The Journey,,12,2,6,"So

So, but not my first online game. I had been playing a large quantity of FPS games online at the time like Counter-Strike, Battlefield, Team Fortress, Day of Defeat, etc. So being in a somewhat online community was not new to me. However, the vast difference between an MMO and FPS-Online game was new.

I played WoW up until very recently, at least, to get to that point depending on who you are and how fast you play. There wasn't much to do along the way, and there was A LOT of grouping for certain quests and instances, etc. Once you got to 60 you didn't have much to do aside from running the instances, raiding and farming rep. All of these activities required extensive levels and time of commitment to get the end result. Even the best of guilds spent 4-6 hours in Molten Core only getting about 16-20 pieces of gear total for 40 players. It took weeks/months of farming reputation with the earlier reps like Silithus/Thorium Brotherhood to get what you needed from them for bosses. I enjoyed these types of long term activities because it gave me something to look forward to.

Once Burning Crusade was released the game started to lean, if I was running a business I would be maximizing my efforts to make money.

From what I have heard, Lineage, etc were all just as intensive as far as time commitment is concerned. To some extent some of those games still are in some areas.

If you look at WoW, everything takes only a few short weeks of time to obtain, most of which takes even less time than that. You can level to max level in less than a month, and be in full epics less than a month later.

I have tried almost every single MMO that exists, most of the MMO's today are about a simple task, get to max level, do the same activity over and over until you get the one item you seek. This as I am sure will be pointed out to me, is called the gear treadmill, or carrot on the stick.

One example I want to throw in here about Rift. When Rift first came out, and immediately started farming instances for gear. Well I was a tank, and my friend was a healer, we were both extremely well versed in instances/raiding from our time with WoW. However, it still took us 2-4 hours to complete 1 instance in Rift. We found this unacceptable and left the game. We were brain washed by WoW in the sense that, if an instance takes longer than 30 minutes, it's a waste of time. I feel as though, these lengthy instances would not have been looked at in the same fashion

I feel as though, and the time I spent with it, when I start a new MMO, my soul focus is, blast through every quest and completely ignore everything until I get to max level. I have never played an MMO to enjoy the game itself as opposed to the end result.

I don't feel as though this is the game's fault, then I think I might be able enjoy a games content as opposed to it's endgame. I severely desire playing MMO's again, however I feel as though I will never be able to genuinely enjoy one again because of what WoW has taught me, mentally. Every MMO that isn't based around a certain model these days is frowned upon, it seems a lot of the negativity towards Defiance is that it isn't like every other MMO, why is that a bad thing?

So my question for you is this

I tried out FFXIV 2.0 and while it is a huge improvement over FFXIV 1.0

I've also really enjoyed TES series and have read up on information for TESO. I do like how it won't use the traditional ES interface (for an MMO that would be very difficult). I don't like how player housing isn't available (at least at launch). But things like massive server, trying to find a good MMO that isn't a copycat or something else poorly implemented. 

Must haves would be - player housing (atleast in the works at release), good music (I still have FFXI, EQ2 and some WoW music in my head from time to time), a good player base, good crafting system (around GW2 and Aion complexity), an achievement system (yes, I said it) and the more open the better as far as exploration.

Some extras that would be nice but not deal breaker - battleground type PvP (I mainly PvE), player bazaar (although I'd rather a auction house).
