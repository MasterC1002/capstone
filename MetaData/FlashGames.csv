First game: Cursed Treasure: Don't Touch My Gems!

Pros:
Alright, and keeps it from getting boring. You start with thee basic tower choices, and after two upgrades, you can choose two different paths for your towers. You also have a mana system that allows you to cast three different spells. The variety of enemies keeps you on your toes and forces you to act strategically. Along with the in-game upgrades for our towers, you also earn general skill points that apply to every round. These upgrades include mana, starting money, tower damage, ect. What's also enjoyable is that your enemies have an actual goal. Instead of getting from point A to point B

Cons:
There are a few elements that this game could use to make it smoother. The main one would have to be hot keys. You can use **shift** to place multipul towers and cast spells of the same type, but it would be more effective for them to prioritize enemies that are carrying gems.

I'll try to be as specific as I can.

Game is/was on Newgrounds


It was a simple game, arenas, etc. You'd then 'recruit' soldiers of various races. Orc Beserkers, Human Gladiators, a troop type used exclusively for carrying goods (and many many more) and could research things to help you in your adventures like ropes and tents.


You'd then send these soldiers out on the world map to various areas. You could pay to have a person scout out to gauge the danger to some extent. Combat report was entirely text based and showed you how it went and if you succeeded

I remember the main issue about it being you couldn't save your progress.
