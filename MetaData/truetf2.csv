A little food for thought truetf2ers

Things to consider:

* Team and solo queueing
* Potential ranked/ratings for players
* Spontaneous tournaments by valve
* Potential spectating comp games easily
* Get such a beautiful comp scene some more spotlight
* Lowers the barrier to entry into comp

Suggestions:


mrsnakers: **GAMBLING**

* Spectate matches/tournaments
* Bet scrap metal on a team/player/etc
* Watch through a valve-implemented spectator system

klingon13524: **Requirements to enter**

* Completed training for class
* 25 Hours/1 milestone achievement for the class
* At time of implementation
* New captains to be voted in by peers/wins/experience

ringl-bells: **Mics only**

* Checkbox to filter for mic-only games.


ObscuredBy: **Queue Systems**

* Options:
* 1: Pick class
* 2: System similar to tf2Lobby


BolKaka: **Bans/formats**

* Template of items/classes
* Individuals can fill out templates and submit
* Public(or some sort of higher authority) vote on lists formats
* Voted in formats become options for players/random queues to use

**Why the hell is this even a comparison?**


When people think of comp TF2 and the scout, most people wouldn't have even assumed anyone actually uses it. In fact, after that video was released, I had more people asking me about why our scout seemingly always ran the Soda Popper  when ""the vanilla scattergun is the best"" than I did about anything else. So why does he use it? Well, Jump4r is odd. If he's not using the SP, he's using the FaN, and I'd imagine he'd use the Shortstop before the regular Scattergun because we think he's slightly retarded. All that aside

**The Graph**
***
Because not everyone likes seeing the raw numbers

[Behold](http://i.imgur.com/KSVeA.png?1)

**Assumptions**
***
If you're still reading this, you're going to be dodging around, and you won't be right up in that Solly's grill for more than 3 seconds (unless you're both doing something wrong). This actually brings up another advantage of the SP that we'll discuss later in that *mini-crits don't take fall off damage*. You'll be able to pop the medic for ""mini-crit meat shots (around 120)"" from a distance where the SG would only be able to do about 60-70. But again, we'll talk about how broken that is later.

The second assumption I'll be making is that you have mini-crits. If you want to talk about the SG vs the non MC SP that's fine, right? 

**Analysis**
***
Now for the fun part. What you'll notice right off the bat is that the Soda Popper can 2 shot *every class in under a 3 third of a second* except for a fully buffed soldier or heavy/buffed heavy. That's a HUGE advantage over the stock scattergun. However, or anything above 426, the stock Scout is in trouble. The SG not only shoots that critical kill shot at a slower rate than the SP, *it has to fire an entire extra round*. The SG will take down a fully buffed heavy in 2.5 seconds in 5 shots. The SP will take down the Heavy in *1.86 seconds* (nearly a second quicker) *with only 4 shots*. Anyone who's danced around a heavy knows that a second can make the difference between life and death. So the Soda Popper has an advantage in terms of firing speed for the second and fourth shot, and disadvantage on the third, fifth, and sixth shot (and obviously anything after that it's a complete blowout that's not even worth discussing). But when you look at possible damage output

**Applicability/Conclusion**
***
This is all assuming perfection of course. Perfection is, it's very possible to one shot scouts at a distance where they can only do 70-80 to you. This also means you can still 2 shot the medic as the pyro airblasts you away into a rocket that sends you flying. Play around with it. *You'll be disgusted with the range the SP can still do 75 at*. The pistol also gets mini-crit boosted, and being able to shoot out ~20 damage a pop from any range is an unbelievably beneficial effect. Hit the med for 120 as you fly around from spam? Fuck waiting to reload. Hit q, switch to your pistol, and spray fire from wherever the hell you are. That's the reason *I* love the SP. I'm not the greatest scout. My aim isn't perfect, and my movement is far from ideal. And jumping into the combo in HL as a scout means you're going to get screwed up. The moment you jump in the pyro, heavy, solly, and you're already top fragging. Any by the 9th shot

That being said, the SP is better for scout on scout fights. But things aren't always equal. The SP gives you the advantage of being able to 1 shot an opposing scout at any given time. But if you haven't killed that scout by your 4th shot you're actually at a disadvantage until his clip runs out. Also, that 3rd shot disadvantage *kills* with mini-sentries. They usually take 3 shots to kill, and sweet mother of god does that reload seem like it takes forever when it's just picking you apart.

So what do you guys think? Anyone else find these numbers as interesting as I do? Or is change too scary? What other benefits/weaknesses (I know there are some of those) have I missed?

To begin with

- [Megadanxzero](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/znb88/what_item_do_you_think_is_severely_underrated/c664uq6) recently brought to my attention that you can maximize your DPS when axtinguishing heavies by going axtinguish -&gt; secondary -&gt; axtinguish

- Airblasting while clipping or touching teammates leads to weird projectile/rocket behavior

- You can remove both weapon graphics *and* your own flamethrower flames by using viewmodel_fov 0 instead of r_drawviewmodel 0. Immensely

- ""Groundstalling"" exists. When you airblast someone from a higher elevation than them

- More importantly, you can avoid it fairly easily.

- If you want to learn arrow reflect timing and animations by heart

- The default viewmodel fov flames are very misleading. tf_debug_flamethrower 1 (which requires sv_cheats 1) will show you how the hitboxes for the flamethrower actually look, and you can use those for getting a feel for the aim as well. 

- As a spy, they will be launched into the air. That's right, you can sometimes deny - or slow - ubers as a spy.

- When training offline

Obviously

I'd also add ones for other classes.. if I had any interesting ones.

1349644126.0,113qxk,How the Doppler Effect affects rocket reflects. ,tasko,154,28,62,"Oh my god I love that title! I feel like Dr. Seuss :3c I just want to shed some light on how Soldier vs. Pyro actually goes down. I've seen questions about rocket reflecting on this subreddit and around other TF2 communities

On to business: The short version of this message is that even though on paper The Pyro can reflect at the same rate as a Soldier fires rockets

Before I continue

After clearing that up, hopefully that's true. However, **when a Soldier and Pyro move towards each other, the doppler effect influences a soldiers rockets, causing the second and third rockets to hit the Pyro sooner than if they were standing still.** This affects the reflection timing that a pyro has to do, and may even cause the rockets to arrive while the airblast ability is still on cooldown. This would make the rocket effectively unreflectable. 

This paragraph is about why this works. A soldier firing rockets is a periodic function- that is, the cooldown is .8s, which makes the frequency of rocket fire 1.25Hz. The Doppler Effect acts upon a frequency source in motion relative to the observer. In our case, the frequency source is the Soldier, and the observer is the Pyro who is trying not to take rockets to the face. Now, if the Pyro can reflect at a rate of 1.25Hz (the same as a Soldier can fire, remember?), what happens when you try to make the second reflect? Depending on your relative velocities and the period during which the airblast will connect to a rocket and reflect it, and you will take a rocket to the face. This isn't as bad if you time your first reflect really early

**[Edit]:**Let's do the math! We can determine the magnitude of the effect using the equation:

 f' = ((v^sound +/- v^observer )/(v^sound -/+ V^source ))*f

which translates into TF2 as:

Apparent Rocket Frequency = ((v^rocket +/- v^pyro )/(v^rocket -/+ v^soldier ) * Rocket Firing Frequency

We want to add the velocity of the pyro and subtract the velocity of the soldier because they're moving towards each other. Then we can pull the data on all of these values from the TF2 wiki. We now get this:

f^apparent = ((1100hu/s + 300hu/s)/(1100hu/s - 240hu/s)) * 1.25Hz

Since this is full of numbers we can solve for f^apparent:

f^apparent = (1400hu/s)/(860hu/s) * 1.25Hz
f^apparent = 1.6279 * 1.25
f^apparent = 2.0349Hz

Cool! Now we have an actual value that we can use to compare stuff! 2.0349Hz equates to a period of *drum roll* 0.4914s! Woah holy shit

This paragraph is about what you should do during gameplay as each class. For Soldiers, run towards a Pyro and aim the first rocket outside of their airblast range. Then, you can try to plant the next few right in his face as his airblasts swing and miss. As a Pyro, you don't want to run at a Soldier if they know you're coming- though this is a bad idea regardless of whether you can time your reflects or not. It's just generally a bad idea to advance towards an opponent who's spotted you and has an advantage as strong as a rocket launcher. Remember pyromaniac habadashers: rockets do a lot of damage, so try to stay away from them. And like pregnancy, the only guaranteed method of prevention is abstinence or removing testicles (*and since you can't do anything about the testicles...*). As far as Pyros are concerned, this doesn't really change your optimal gameplay strategy much. It does help explain a few rockets that you swore you should be able to reflect.

One of biggest problems with Demoknighting is the shield. While you gain short-range mobility

I've been playing around with this loadout: Loose Cannon + Chargin' Targe + Claidheamh Mòr, or about 2/3 of the way finished with the jump. 

Whenever I play with the stock loadout it's very difficult to deal with close-range threats, I can just knock them back with the LC to minimize their threat. This loadout tries to get sneaky picks by either isolating the enemy for a 1v1 or sneaking up behind them and charging for a crit sword. An interesting technique I've been able to pull off pretty consistently involves shooting someone with the LC and knocking them far away, [then using the nearby cannonball](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUKKoiZlibE&amp;t=0m41s) to jump toward the person I knocked back [and charge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_3uGSVvZ6I). It's been especially good at getting medic picks. Still, it spares nothing when the enemy retaliates, as the shield's resistances make the Demoknight one tough cookie to crack.

This is viable in Highlander because other classes can take up the Demoman's role of area denial

Let me know what you think!

EDIT: [I have uploaded a video demonstrating the mobility of this loadout](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWk6VjkMp4o).

##Scripts and Setup


There are many scripts out there for different purposes. As you continue to play scout you may find some of them very useful and some not very useful at all. Don't hesitate to ditch some of the less useful ones and substitute them with your own! Scripting is quite simple but if you don't feel like going through the effort of learning it (something I strongly encourage) I have compiled my personal scripts down below.


---

##A. Null-cancelling script

This script is so useful

&gt;bind w +mfwd
&gt;
&gt;bind s +mback
&gt;
&gt;bind a +mleft
&gt;
&gt;bind d +mright
&gt;
&gt;alias +mfwd ""-back;+forward;alias checkfwd +forward""
&gt;
&gt;alias +mback ""-forward;+back;alias checkback +back""
&gt;
&gt;alias +mleft ""-moveright;+moveleft;alias checkleft +moveleft""
&gt;
&gt;alias +mright ""-moveleft;+moveright;alias checkright +moveright""
&gt;
&gt;alias -mfwd ""-forward;checkback;alias checkfwd none""
&gt;
&gt;alias -mback ""-back;checkfwd;alias checkback none""
&gt;
&gt;alias -mleft ""-moveleft;checkright;alias checkleft none""
&gt;
&gt;alias -mright ""-moveright;checkleft;alias checkright none""
&gt;
&gt;alias checkfwd none
&gt;
&gt;alias checkback none
&gt;
&gt;alias checkleft none
&gt;
&gt;alias checkright none
&gt;
&gt;alias none """"


---


##B. Crouch Jump script

This script is quite simply in both

&gt;bind space +crouchjump
&gt;
&gt;alias +crouchjump ""+jump;+duck""
&gt;
&gt;alias -crouchjump ""-jump;-duck""


---

##C. Mousebutton binds

This one isn't necessary at all but something I found to improve my gameplay a lot. Since the Scout doesn't have a secondary ability (apart from the double jump) you are free to use the mouse2 button.
This script binds the Scattergun to mouse1 and you will attack when pressing mouse1. It binds the pistol to mouse2 and it's attack to pressing mouse2. The bat is bound to 3 on the keyboard and it's attack is 3 aswell. However this script right here is customized to my likings. What that means? It has my personal crosshairs

&gt;// scattergun
&gt;
&gt;alias ""+scatter"" ""slot1;+attack;cl_crosshair_file default;cl_crosshair_scale 20;cl_crosshair_red 0;cl_crosshair_green 128;cl_crosshair_blue 192;r_drawviewmodel 0;viewmodel_fov 0""
&gt;
&gt;alias ""-scatter"" ""-attack""
&gt;

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;
&gt;bind ""mouse2"" ""+pistol""
&gt;
&gt;bind ""3"" ""+bat""


---

##D. Comp ragdolls/gibs

Most competitive players find ragdolls and gibs distracting. The below scripts disable them/make them fade away very fast so you can be sure that you killed someone as soon as he disappeares.

&gt;// Disable ragdolls
&gt;
&gt;cl_ragdoll_fade_time ""0""

&gt;
&gt;violence_agibs ""0""
&gt;
&gt;violence_hblood ""0""
&gt;
&gt;violence_hgibs ""0""


---

##E. Crosshair flash

This is a simple script that flashes your crosshair color everytime you press wasd. Useful for keeping track of your crosshair in the middle of the fight. Intended for use with the spy's ambassador but also works quite well with scouts.
Once again the colors that will flash can be edited by editing the cl_crosshair_color values.  
Warning: If you use this together with the null-canceling script put this into your config and erase all bind wasd lines.

&gt;
&gt;alias -ml ""-moveleft;dotxhaircolor""


---

##F. Aarons crosshair switcher

This is not an actual script but more a program that I urge you to use. What it does is, insert into the above scripts and you now customized the crosshair for the weapons (like mentioned in the mousebutton binds).


---

##G. viewmodels

Ah
I advise turning them off for secondary and primary but keeping them on for your melee. You will know which weapon you are using by using custom crosshairs for every weapon.


---

##H. Tracers

Similiar to viewmodels they only obstruct your view. They are mostly inaccurate and don't really give you any feedback on if you actually hit someone. Just turn on hitsound and damage display as text.


---

##I. Auto reload

Why should you turn on auto reload? Why. the. hell. not? With disabled viewmodels there is literally no downside. There is no increase in time it takes to fire whilst reloading. Your current clip won't be ""discarded"". You can now bind useful stuff to r (like ""Need a dispenser here!"" or ""Spy!""). Do it. As simple as that.


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////



##Movement

I'll cover some of the most basic movement tips I got.


---

##A. How to move

You want to be unpredictable when dodging and preferably unseen when moving around the map. Think of playing scout like playing spy. Meatshot are your backstabs. With the exchange of mobility for cloaking. Also you can defend yourself a little better in 1v1 situations.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

##Vs. Soldier


Never ever ever ever engage a soldier head on. If he's at full health it's very difficult. If he's buffed then you may aswell just suicide and jump off a cliff. There are times when you have to 1v1 a soldier. Like when you are backcapping and their roaming soldier falls back to get you. Wait until he jumps. He'll waste a good portion of health on the jump and that's a pretty good advantage. Don't double jump. No seriously don't. If you double jump then you basically wasted your only steering tool in midair. And the next thing you know is that there will be a rocket where you are jumping waiting for you. Only engage soldiers if they are not buffed AND you can get a good meatshot off. Generally you want to get 1-2 meatshots off before retreating and poking with your pistol/chipshots. Most soldiers have the annoying habit to immeadietly shoot at their feet when they're being attacked from behind. Use this to your advantage. After the initial meatshot jump above their head and disorient them. If it's not necessary that you take him down there is no shame in retreating.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

##Vs. Demoman


Ah Demoman. They are to be honest a fairly easy target. Are they pipe spamming? Good job

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

##Vs. Scouts


Don't jump. Mirror his movements if you are landing your shots. He strafes right (his perspective)? You strafe left. As simple as that. You won't have to adjust your aim as much if you can keep good track of him with your movement keys. Generally speaking scout vs. scout fights are often undesired and unneccesary. Concentrate on other picks. If you are _not_ landing your shots then by all means BAIL OUT! Act unpredictable. Jump inbetween. Change directions. Move away from him! If he lands a meatshot first you lost the encounter.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

##Vs. Medic


Do I really need to tell you how to pick a medic? Watch out for his pocket. Go in. Point and shoot.


---

##B. Patterns

Most patterns are extremely bad. The human mind is astonishingly good at predicting and recognizing patterns. And once your enemy figured them out you will die and die and die. However you can have pre-determined semi-random patterns. One of my favorites is: Move in one direction. Stop. Continue moving. Most people expect a change of direction after a pause. Going in the same confuses them. Don't do it twice in a row or you'll get shot down. Play MGE and find your own patterns. Experiment and have fun.


---

##C. Pattern interrupt

Break up your patterns. If you feel like you are doing something too much change it and mix it up. Combining different elements of different patterns is also nice.



//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


##Aiming

---

##A. How to properly aim

Aim with your movement keys. You want to follow your opponent with your strafing. Then jerk/twitch in their direction and shot. Rinse and repeat.


---

##B. How to train your aim

Play either MGE or go on DM servers. I prefer DM servers because they allow for a more realistic setting where people are distracted and you can actually shoot them in the back. MGE is fine too.


---

##C. Muscle memory

Muscle memory is pretty important. I suggest you read a book/wikipedia article about it and then download one of the countless muscle memory maps there are.


---

##                                                          D. Sensitivity

Honestly play with whatever you are comfortable with. If you feel like you are overshooting your targets then lower it. If you feel like you are lagging behind up it a bit. Important is that you KEEP it once you found a good setting. Only then can you seriously train your muscle memory.

No

The new changes makes a lot of weapons newly viable for competitive TF2, but all-in-all, I don't think this is the absolute ground-breaking change that TF2 needs to bring in entirely new strategies and completely shake up the game. 

It seems that a large reason for this is because so much of the pace of TF2 revolves around an über. The invulnerability it grants your medic is incredibly powerful for any push, making it the defacto wait-for moment. Rounds are oft won and lost due to a single über.

And this is why I think the medi-gun should be banned.

^^^.  
[Surely you can't be serious.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A5t5_O8hdA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=11s)

Up until this point, really didn't provide enough benefits to a team to make it a truly viable alternative. The only reason the kritzkrieg was viable is because the catch-up when at an über disadvantage combined well with the devestation it could wreck upon a team to turn the tides.

Unfortunately

If we ban the medi-gun  we achieve an odd balance and harmony.

*The quickfix allows for supreme mobility, it makes sense for the losing team to switch…*

*To a kritzkrieg. The kritz will build fast and will be devastating

*By a vaccinator. With a couple of burst-übers building in seconds it will be ready almost as soon as it is in play to counter the incoming kritz. But unfortunately for the vaccinator…*

*The quickfix allows for back-caps like never before. Speed and mobility once again make for some serious flanking and superior positioning

All 3 medi-guns now provide completely different utilities that have different advantages over each other

I think that by removing the stock medi-gun from play

1350532175.0,11o78b,Is deceiving the other team in pre-game justifiable?,korili,132,23,86,"**TL;DR** at the bottom of the post.

After recently hitting 1300 hours of playtime I decided to try dipping my toes into competitive. So I tried lobbies for a bit, and now I'm playing my first season in UGC.

Now what I noticed was that both in lobbies and later on in the actual UGC matches is that people start playing before the game begins.
That is, like which classes the spy prefers disguising as, how good the pyro is at reflecting, how fast the heavy tracks, etc.

So what I started doing was, from MG-sandwich-GRU to MG-shotty-GRU, and strip to only a Mann Co. hat.

Then I play subtly bad. GRU until i see a enemy, and figure that I'm pretty much a free kill.

So when the actual match starts the other team often ignores me, CP) / 1st points(A/D, PL) in our matches because I'll get ignored and then do my job.

Last match, demo, soldier and pyro, all stood up to our spawndoors and got wiped.

I have been devoting my efforts for almost 4 months sololy to bring together a comprehensive site to bring the gap between random pubs and tf2 competitive players. I contributed a lot to the site, fronted the money for server costs, and now I've been kicked to the curb right before release. THAT'S BULLSHIT.

&gt; We were actually supposed to have release on friday

DJC's prediction on the game:

bud &gt; xen 5-2 by dearjohncarter

This match will be the debut cast for ESEA TV's TF2 division, and mausy will show off the talent that earned him an Invite spot against the (thus far) struggling PYYYOUR, but Justin still has the ability to tear teams to shreds on sniper and he should not be challenged too much on scout. I will be interested to see how Seagull performs against a half-decent team, to see if he uses that gigantic TF2 brain to the best of its capabilities in match two of the season.

As you may remember from another reddit post (http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/v9wff/get_na_team_to_i46_xpost_from_tf2/) eXtelevision is partnering with the entire TF2 community to send a team of American players to the UK Insomnia 46 LAN late august 2012. While donations have been trickling in, Key, Bud, Metal and all other TF2 Item Drive of Epic and Unprecedented Proportions (Name is a work in Progress). The goal of GNAEXIHKBMTIDE (as we at eXtv HQ so affectionately call it) is simple, gather the digital goodies of the TF2 legion, smelt down those that are only worth their scrap, hoard all the rest

1. DONATE ITEMS!!!!!! - we are in desperate need for items and this will be how we collect everything we need for steps two and three. We are taking anything (please smelt metal down beforehand) but in particular we want:
REFINED METAL &amp; KEYS 
Although we do accept individual weapons and other forms of metal
HATS &amp; OTHER ACCESSORIES 
These items will be used in large quantities for the lottery and auctioning bundles
STRANGE WEAPONS 
Strange weapons are really useful to us (especially the variants of normally used competitive weapons) and will be used in auctioning packs and other projects
PAINTS
These will be used to personalise the aforementioned accessories
If you have anything to donate at all, so if you fall into that category (or just cannot afford a donation) this is a great way to contribute. If you have already made a monetary donation, feel free to give here!

2. Donate Money (and get raffle tickets)!!!!!!!
For every five dollars that someone donates, strange weapons, buds, bills hats and even one very special Unusual Hat! As we get closer to the end of the drive, we will announce what it is that will be in the raffle, but I assure you that thousands of dollars of TF2 items (as well as some super secret real life swag) will be up for grabs. If you donate more than 5 dollars, you get more than 1 ticket. With over 4 thousand dollars donated at the time of the post

3. Participate in the Auction!!!!!
At the end of the item drive, hat bundles are all up for grabbings! For this event, we are unveiling a super secret project of ours. There will be a limited number of complete strange item sets, each weapon carefully nametagged and giftwrapped by a famous invite player of that class. While we don't have any juicy details for now, lets just say you will look awesome hitting a triple airshot with your very own “TLR’s Own Strange Airshot Machine”. The raffle and the auction are two separate entities, the raffle is for everyone who donates 5 dollars or more, the auction is a public event where people (even those who didn't donate) bid on a separate stash of goodies.

The drive ends August 3rd, attract sponsors and help eXtv make a super special, super secret documentary about the first International TF2 LAN!

##Index

1 Introduction

2 What is positioning?

3 Why should I be concerned about positioning?

4 Transitioning from pub play to competitive play

5 Determining proper positioning

6 Abusing poor enemy positioning

7 Practice
*****
##Introduction

Welcome to the jungle.  My name is Frank
*****
##What is positioning?

If you think positioning is simply where you are standing, but remember, there is no I in team fortress 2, unless you are using roman numerals.  But you know what?  The Romans had bad positioning, and that's why we use the American 2, invented by our forefathers in an attempt to find the proper definition of positioning.

Positioning is a topic that involves all players on the field.  Remember that where you are standing has no bearing on the outcome of the game unless you are standing in the proper place in relation to both the enemy
*****
##Why should I be concerned about positioning?

Have you ever played a competitive style match?  Did you ever realize that you are now surrounded by 4 people, and that needs to change.  Preferably by burning down the video owner's house with a combustible lemon, but that will wait for another guide on another day.

Proper positioning can lead you to favorable advantages that make the fight ahead miles easier.  A well positioned player can both shut down opposition
*****
##Transitioning from pub to competitive play

I will start with a story from my original set of TF2lobby games:

There I was, we all arrive at middle as usual.  As soon as exit the choke, I rocket jump directly onto their medic, and die gloriously before I even had a chance to give the enemy medic a single rocket to chew on.

What I did wrong was what I like to call **Terrible positioning**.  Ideally, you will probably fail if you attempt to take on 4+ enemies at the same time, unless you know you have a very strong incentive to push in(all really low hp, ubercharge, enemy contracted cancer, etc).
*****
##Determining proper positioning

Determining proper positioning will requires something that is usually avoided: Thinking.  If you are standing by yourself, ask yourself these questions:

* Does the enemy have more players alive?
* Are we at an uber disadvantage?
* Does the terrain favor the attacker?
* Are your flanks properly covered?
* If 2 enemies rounded a nearby corner

If any of these equate to yes, the opposite is true as well.  If you can evaluate these questions for yourself as the attacker, it's time to take advantage of the situation.
*****
##Abusing poor enemy positioning

So did you follow the checklist above?  Are you up 2 men and have a 25% uber advantage?  Well it's time to bring the pain.  Also

* Enemy flank classes extended?

-- Deal with them as a team if they are far forward.

* Enemy flank classes dead/wounded?

-- Push your flank side forward hard

* Enemy combo extended?

-- Use the whole team's firepower to deal with forward enemies.

* Enemy combo dead/wounded?

-- Push the combo forward, and engage in the pinching. 

*****
##Practicing good positioning

The easy way to practice positioning is to think about it.  There I said it, you probably were overextending unless you are the roaming soldier attempting a pick.  If your flank was all dead, and your combo gets pinched really hard, it was time to back out.

Thinking about what happened every life is a very straightforward way of looking and evaluating.  Remember that positioning is also a team-based activity,,False,,t5_2stfn,False,,True

1326402280.0,oef8f,Map talk of the week - Foundry,Davidmoose,91,9,22,"Hey /r/truetf2

I'll be doing one map talk/discussion a week, as well.

I apologize in advance for the length of this post.

___

**Rollouts**

By far, through the right side of yard, then out through [right garage](http://i.imgur.com/9ZuMY.jpg) to [the platform at mid](http://i.imgur.com/Kca2y.jpg).  From here, Soldiers can jump onto the roof covering mid and teams can then go about their basic strats.

Demomen can benefit from rolling out through [left garage](http://i.imgur.com/rUyai.jpg)

___

**Middle analysis and Sniper lines**

The first thing I noticed about Foundry mid is that it's *VERY* Sniper-friendly.  For example

Engineers benefit most from using the Gunslinger/Wrangler on this map

Soldiers can jump up on the roof of the middle point

Flanking classes [can get into left garage](http://i.imgur.com/oUJl2.jpg) through the underside by the right shack or through the small entrance by the train.  The medic combo ought to do their best to not got sniped - possibly by holding an aggressive lower position behind the right shack.  Remember that the most aggressive team on Foundry mid often wins it.

___

**Holding Garage**

If you've lost middle and you're stuck holding garage

The left garage is easily flankable from many directions

___

**Attacking Garage**

Obviously, as enemy teams will often be clustered together to try to stop your advancement.

___

**Holding 2nd Point**

Holding 2nd, and few places that an Engineer can safely put up a sentry.

If a Sniper gets on the upper platform, you better get him out of there fast.

A Soldier has a decent chance of spamming out anyone holding left garage from the train, defending 2nd comes down to who has the better DM.

___

**Attacking 2nd Point**

Congratulations, as he can defend those two from jumping classes and rain his own hell down on the point.  A push from right garage always works well, especially if you can wrap around the enemy team and strike them from behind.

___

**Holding Last Point**

If you're stuck here

DO NOT LET THEM TAKE THE [UPPER CATWALK](http://i.imgur.com/KFHVu.jpg).  Once they get into the room (red) or take over the catwalk

___

**Attacking Last Point**

Obviously, so use it to cover your ass.

A heckling class push from the left door is a great distraction to pull some of the enemy out into the open

___

Feel free to comment away, so take everything with a grain of salt and make sure you practice your ass off for this map.

1358635087.0,16wcdc,A humble idea for a new type of Spy weapon,CQH,117,41,89,"An idea for a new Spy weapon has been bouncing around my head for weeks.  I came up with this in light of the fact that Spy is a support class.  I'm not trying to make him into a primary damage class.

**What about a Camera that marks a selected target for Death?**

- Camera would occupy Slot 1.
- Deal only 10% of the damage that the Revolver does.  So
- Emit a bright flash to maybe give away the Spy's location.  Think DSLR or ""Paparazzi"" flash camera.
- EDIT: Flash would be tinted Red/Blu depending on Spy's team color (kinda like how flames or decloak have a hint of the character's team color).
- Camera has telephoto lens enabling it to zoom.
- Target is marked for 15 seconds.  
- Only one or two targets at a time.  (not sure which is more useful or OP)
- All damage is Mini-Crits *or* Full Crits but camera flash needs to ""cool off"" before being ready again. (not sure which is more useful or OP)
- EDIT: [DaveFromMarketing has a better idea for a model](http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/16wcdc/a_humble_idea_for_a_new_type_of_spy_weapon/c7zz3tp)
- EDIT: MexicanMouthwash suggested an even better camera in the Steam Workshop made by [Wowza](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=111771378)!

So, key picks), the spy can coordinate with the team and mark targets when team is pushing.

The telephoto camera also keeps with the Spy espionage theme.  There's always a scene in the Spy movie where the good guys look at photos of the bad guy that needs to be ""taken care of"".

The camera keeps with the idea that the Spy is a support class.

It's a situational weapon

I can see this not helping the Lone Wolf pub Spy.  But

Again

Thoughts?

EDIT 3:

Some great suggestions by [CuriositySphere](http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/16wcdc/a_humble_idea_for_a_new_type_of_spy_weapon/c8056jx):

- Mini-Crits against the target
- No Damage at all by the camera
- Limited range of use (similar to a Sentry)

This is all wonderful

I believe it's an old Bruce Lee quote that went along the lines of ""bring me a man who hasn't changed his training in a while and I'll show you a man whose physique hasn't changed in a while"".  The same goes for practicing your skills as a player.  This short guide will be aimed at getting you past your plateau in your gameplay.

___

**1. Solo Training Mods/Maps:** Jump maps, aiming, and movement.

Do a quick search in the subreddit search bar for sensitivity and you'll see we discuss it into the ground here - people are genuinely curious about how to make their aim better through sensitivity.  My advice is that you should be comfortable with whatever you pick

**2. 1v1 Training Mods/Maps:** MGEMod, you'll fail at any of these mods.  

Now I have a note about MGE.  People come to me saying they play MGE often but they're not getting any better.  I tell them that if you want to get better at MGE, but many people don't take away two of the most important lessons from the mod - positioning and awareness.

I explain in every video that I produce that high ground gives you an advantage.  This is true in MGE as well - how hard is it to overtake Spire?  However, play some Quake - the entire game is about positional audio.  This is important in the next parts.

**3. Multiplayer Training Mods:** [TF2Lobby](http://www.tf2lobby.com) and SOAP DM.  I add Lobby here because it's poor for working on communication and teamwork.  Lobby can help build basic communication, you can make up for this by using the skills you've already built - positioning, DM, jumps, and aim.  See how these all build on top of each other?

SOAP DM is a great change from MGE, Soldier, Demo, Sniper) on the middle areas of the common 6's maps.  Positioning and awareness are more important than in MGE as you're now against up to 5 other people, so this mod works on your ability to keep track of several people at once.

**4. Teamwork:** With enough experience in your class you can join a team.  Any player who has properly built up their skills from the beginning will do well as a part of a team

 - Communication.  If you're a Scout, you'll be able to call out enemy positioning as you see it.  Demomen have to be able to relay who they damage to their Scouts so the Scouts can rush in and finish them off.  A Medic's main communication role is to make sure everyone on their team knows where he/she is.

 - Situational awareness.  As a team you'll have to learn how to hold a position

To get them to be accurate, at least until I can implement loading of the local gcf and vtf files?

Let's take the Soldier

___

 - **The Liberty Launcher:** With one less rocket in each clip and 40% increased rocket speed, the LL can be used successfully to spam out a choke point, gain the edge on quick-thinking and quick-moving Scouts, put a rocket in between a weak enemy and his exit path before he has time to react, and pocket the Medic by denying jumpers an easy kill (as it is arguably easier to airshot with the LL due to increased rocket speed).  Lack of one rocket means that the Soldier needs to be smart about where he clicks M1, and has to realize that he cannot do as much upfront damage as a Soldier with 4 rockets.

*Lessons: Area denial

 - **The Cow Mangler 5000:**  Without the ability to receive Kritz from a Medic

*Lessons: Medic/Combo support

 - **The Black Box:**  Encourages roamer-style play by being lenient with the amount of health the Soldier has to seek.  A Black Box user gains the most benefit by taking distance chipshots on enemies or groups of enemies, or groups of enemies.

*Lessons: Picking targets, rocket conservation*

 - **Direct Hit:**  Encourages high risk, such as juggling or airshots, encourages a DH user to be aggressive and decisive about taking said shots.

*Lessons: Accuracy

___

Each one of these is translatable to the vanilla Rocket Launcher.  A Soldier, teaching him how to be choosy with his rocket placement.

Foreword

So after deliberation I’ve decided to write a succinct guide for playing Spy in Highlander. Generally speaking, but naturally some personal opinions are going to eke their way in. I'm bound to have forgotten a bunch of stuff, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated, and if there’re any responses which I feel are particularly useful, I’ll incorporate them here with full credit.
So without further ado…

Afterword

Your Role:

Ok so of course I am aware of the significant contribution to the Spy class made by Watsyurdeal? (a.k.a. TheSentryisaSpy). His videos sum a vast encyclopaedia detailing the ins-and-outs of the role of the Spy, is probably no-one) I’d highly recommend them. Here, however, I thought I’d describe a more Highlander-oriented Spy role.
In a nutshell

i)Communication:

The Spy has a completely unique view of the battlefield; the majority of your time will be spent behind the enemy lines. From this vantage point you can view the intricate details of your opponents’ set-up. This insight must be taken advantage of: It is vital that the positions of the Combo are called, so use that mic!

ii)Priorities:

Stating the obvious: you have a knife which insta-kills. This means if played correctly you have the ability to topple your opponents’ most powerful asset. Generally, without factoring in respawn and slower-charge times. It’s pretty clear here that the Medic is usually your top priority. Of course, it is naïve to assume that you’re going to be able to drop the Medic ad infinitum, so aiming for the heavy classes (I’m just thinking of the Heavy and Demo here) will also squash their potential to wreak havoc with an Über.
A lot of teams let their Snipers duke it out in 1v1 and tell their Spy to focus on the combo. However

When attacking the final point of a map, a Sentry destruction would allow your team to focus on the enemy combo with dramatically reduced external pressure. A useful tactic is to try and synchronise the sapping of a sentry with your team’s Combo push to quickly destroy the Sentry.
A key factor in a team’s efficiency is its mobility. A simple teleport destruction can severely hinder your opponent’s movement, it’s ALL about the clock.

iii)Illusions:

Keeping the team unsure of your location and your plan is important. Simple tricks such as using friendly disguises (especially with the Dead Ringer)
Sidenote: The scout disguise, as you make yourself as small as possible.

iv)Application/Dealing with Pyros:

So that’s all very well and good: you’re now a walking, only to be burned and rejected by the enemy Pyro. Learning nothing, this process is repeated ad nauseam until all that’s happened is a lot of wasted time. This “suicide spy” mantra is grossly inefficient; you need to maximise your potential.
Hence, you don't have to wait for the God's of Chance to distract the Pyro: telling your team to spam projectiles at the Medic or Sentry is a great way to induce the Pyro into projectile-reflecting. As soon as you hear that their Pyro is down you want to manoeuvre yourself into a position that will give you a great chance of getting a lovely Medic stab. Once when speaking with Hurri, he said that he seemed to find teams became sloppy at spy checking when they were organising a push. That window of just a few seconds should be all you need to punish their unawareness.
Now the above segment was rather passively written; a lot of the time you can still attack whilst the Pyro is spychecking. I spoke to Fearboy on the matter and he made the excellent point: Walls are your friends. Some spies hide behind walls and use this more than their cloak to ascertain the position of the enemy Pyro. By listening to the sound of his/her flames it is possible to locate exactly where he/she is. As soon as the Pyro steps a little too far in the wrong direction

v)Quick Summary:

To summarise: you are a support class, but your K/D ratio is to not at all be regarded: so long as you’re disrupting their team and neutralising threats you’re doing your job correctly. Of course, TF2 is very situational. You yourself will have to figure out the required compromises between aggression and pacifism: You don't want to be too passive in that you're inactive, but you don't want to be too aggressive in that you're constantly dead. Each situation will require a differing amount of aggression, and it will change every match. Naturally, if your team is stomping the other, then you can afford to be aggressive without much thought. If however you're finding yourselves losing, knowing how to attack in any situation

Map-type specifics

Payload

Attack:

Pushing the cart is a task that is normally left to the scout +1 (most often the engineer). There are however situations whereby a Spy will be able to sneakily push the cart a small but crucial distance when the opponents are otherwise occupied, a valid tactic is to try and keep him completely shut down for the rest of the game, destroying everything he tries to build. Other than that, it’s pretty standard requirements: try and get key picks that will limit their defensive resources.

Defence:

At the beginning of the round, you’ve effectively achieved nothing as their respawn times will be shorter, and they’ll have others to push on the cart. After the set-up time has elapsed, you’re required to stop that Über push. Communicate exactly which door they’re pushing from and try your very best to nab one of the Combo. I’ll add that the set-up time does allow you to get into a nice position with the Cloak and Dagger. Payload maps really are a wonderful place for the Spy to get to work, as there are so many spots which are safe to decloak, and so much metal that you have many different options available in deciding how to taking their team down. Make sure you destroy the Teleporters, forcing them to walk all the way to the cart and gaining valuable time. Medic picks, will gain your team an incredible amount of time (assuming your Medic doesn’t die).

5CP:

These maps tend to arrive at many a stalemate (consider Granary and Foundry) with equally-matched teams. The stand-off situations which arise mean that the opponents will have more watchful eyes on their key assets. Hence, if only for observational purposes: if you see an opponent (e.g. Sniper) trying to peak, you must tell your team immediately which choke-point to spam to punish over-extension. Plenty of consideration will have to go into your plan of action, as getting a key pick will allow your team to push through to the next point. A very passive but sometimes effective style of play is to camp a blind spot with the Cloak and Dagger, and wait for the opposing team to push closer to you. This will not be to everyone’s taste, however.

A nice feature of 5CP maps is the excellent chance you will have to spawn camp specific players

KOTH:

In order to play king of the hill, or between the pillars on Lakeside. I don’t think the Cloak and Dagger really makes an appearance on these maps; it seems more suited for 5CP style play, but feel free to correct me here.
Snipers have excellent sightlines on these maps

It can be tricky to secure a stab on the Combo before they start a push
It's necessary to keep an eye on the cloak

Loadouts:

Now I’m going to focus on the tools in your arsenal which will bring about this disruption. There are countless threads detailing to death the specifications of every Spy weapon

i)Guns:

There are plenty of different gun options available to the Spy. It’s mostly just a matter of taste.

i)i)Revolver:

A powerhouse of a gun

i)ii)Ambassador:

If you can consistently get headshots

i)iii)Diamondback:

Certainly viable in Highlander. I’d like someone to write a larger review for this- an appraisal would be appreciated- but I believe that this weapon can be beautifully used on Koth maps

i)iv)L’Entranger:

Pointless. BECAUSE: this does not increase the chances of your survivability. A good spy knows how to handle his cloak. Therefore anything which gives you extra cloak in return for less damage becomes useless.

i)v)Enforcer:

Banned.

ii)Sappers:

ii)i)Red-Tape Recorder:

Banned.

ii)ii)Standard Sapper:

Your only option!

iii)Knives:

iii)i)Stock Knife:

The most flexible knife in Highlander. Does what it says on the tin.

iii)ii)Kunai:

The reward of kunai comes after the stab and the point of spy is getting a good stab

iii)iii)Your Eternal Reward:

Could possibly be used for 1 life in an attempt to get a sneaky chainstab with the reduced sound but overall you're better off picking another knife.

iii)iv)Spycicle:

The only other knife you’ll use besides the Stock. Let’s you get away from Pyros rather easily. A Spy known as Evan (on youtube “stingcandy”) has made some interesting videos on why he believes the metagame of the spy is evolving to Revolver+Spycicle+Dead Ringer. Well worth watching.

iii)v)Big Earner:

Pointless. See L'etranger

iv)Watches:

The nice thing about the Spy is that every watch is viable in Highlander

iv)i)Invisibility Watch:

A very useful and flexible watch

iv)ii)Cloak and Dagger:

In stark contrast to Pubs

iv)iii)Dead Ringer:

Often over-used

Afterword:

That pretty much sums up everything I have to say. Hopefully I haven’t forgotten anything vital. Like I said at the beginning

(Hildreth wrote this)

You guys are super special and the single most keen Highlander loving community in TF2. So I have chosen this website to begin promoting what I hope will be a highly anticipated showmatch between The Syndicate (the top dogs in UGC Platinum NA at the moment) and the self-crowned world's best Highlander team - SNSD (undefeated in EU officials for the last two years). With all of the EU v NA hype going down recently

The match will be on Sunday 14th October at 9.15pm Central European Time - That is 3.15pm East Coast time, with The Syndicate being majority West Coast, we'll see both teams rack up an average of 90-120 ping per player with the exception of TMP and his amazing internet (no pressure). 

The maps will be Badwater

The purpose of the match is to bring the two Highlander scenes more together

1361999950.0,19co0b,[HL] Tips for Medics,Davidmoose,78,9,15,"So I've been mentoring some of the lower-level Medics for the past couple of weeks

___

**OFFENSE**

1. *Be aggressive.*  A lot of Medics wait to push until they have an Uber advantage, to go forward to the next defensive spot and control it, grab that opportunity and use it.

2. *Be decisive.*  This one's going to be especially important this week on cp_steel.  Once you make a call, then question it halfway through a push and turn around, you'll most likely die.

___

**DEFENSE**

1. *Be aggressive.*  What?  Yeah.  Being aggressive on defense also has some huge advantages.  If you can consistently keep the offense hurt, you're going to have a field day with your holds.  Being passive has its moments, but the rewards for being aggressive are often far greater than sitting around.

2. *Play with numbers.*  Hopefully everyone is familiar with counting Uber - the idea that it takes roughly 40 seconds for a Medic to build up a charge.  As a Medic, stalling the cap, or getting better situated on a point.

3. *Is it Spy time?*  My team and I play a mindgame during matches called ""Spy Time"".  Basically, because that's about how long it'll take for a Spy to get into position to go for a pick.  This is when my team re-doubles their Spy-checking efforts.  I find that this game is often more important on Defense than it is on Offense, but it's good practice to keep Spy Time in mind the entire game.

___

**GENERAL**


1. *Be assertive.*  This is my favorite part of being a Medic.  YOU HAVE FULL CONTROL.  USE IT.  You can tell your team where to be

2. *Be confident.*  Even if you aren't 100% invested in your call, it won't help your team any.  

3. *Heal everyone.*  Obviously it's important to keep your Heavy classes even heavier by giving them constant overheals

4. *It's okay to die and drop sometimes.*  I don't mean to make an example of anyone, but it's okay because he'll be in the fight the entire time he's up and spreading the heals necessary for his team to win the fight.

### I am having issues

&gt; Try the following things:
&gt;
&gt; * Make sure you unzip your program before running it
&gt; * Upgrade java to its latest version
&gt; * Try to generate the scripts locally
&gt; * Post an explanation + screenshot (if applicable) with the crash/issue on my github page: github.com/logophobia/YetAnotherTF2ConfigGenerator or add me at steamcommunity.com/id/logophobia

### What is viewmodel switch mode?

&gt; It indicates when the viewmodel is turned off if that is set for the weapon slot:
&gt;
&gt; * Immediately after switching weapons
&gt; * After firing a weapon
&gt; * After switching strafe directions
&gt; * After either firing or strafing

### I have a feature request

&gt; Post any suggestions on the github page or in the thread where you found the program

### What does medic radar do precisely?

&gt; It toggles medic autocall to 150%, it will go back to its original autocall level

### How can I customize this even more?

&gt; You could try editing the original templates, the language used is ssp: http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/ssp-reference.html. After that, the program will use your editted version of the templates. 

### What other ways to customize tf2 are there?

&gt; You can install custom huds

### My ambassador crosshair disappeared

&gt; For some reason

### Changing settings inside tf2 doesn't work

&gt; The scripts that were installed now regulate most of your settings inside tf2. Change stuff through the program

### Can I use my settings from a version of your program before 1.0

&gt; Yes. Drag the settings.xml file from your old program into the profile folder of the new program. Now you should be able to load your settings from the profile menu.",,t5_2stfn,1356265977.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/15abr0/tf2configgenerator_version_10_release_candidate/

Then I look at my stats and logs and start there. See where my big differences are. Then I go out and practice what Im seeing. Find the flaws in your own game - again - be honest with yourself.

Basically, and solely focuses on ~BIG PLAYS~. Even if I had a rather limited selection of clips from only 1 season worth of matches, I hope I did a good job at this. I was strapped for time so many of these clips aren't exactly as obvious of important plays as I would like them to be, but generally every pick in this video either lead to a point captured/being successfully defended or completing the objective/winning the round or was, in general, just a big dick play. I left the HUD on on many of the clips so that you can see the round timers/point captures/etc to kind of infer the importance of some of them since I couldn't do it in a more obvious manner.

Again, but I hope it isn't too terrible and you guys enjoy it.

I'd just like to take a moment to thank all the team leaders (and also those in a scheduling position) for their work.

God forbid you have the make the call to cut somebody and look for a replacement.

## Introduction

Welcome to the academy.  My name is Frank.  People around these parts know me as bflFrank and lfbFrank, bfl` Frank, or for short, Frank.

My personal resume from Team Fortress consists of about 1400 hours total played, and what you should expect when you decide it is time to play ~~Soldier~~ the best class.
*****
## Why Soldier?

Soldier is an incredibly well rounded class.  With near-perfect play, stop bigger plays, and get sweet frag video clips in the process.  As a soldier, you have the distinct advantage as being a mobile powerhouse, with very strong short to mid-range firepower.  The downsides to the soldier are fairly direct: slow speeds without expending ammo/health and a fairly lengthy reload when completely depleted on ammunition.

If you want to play as a solid foundation to the team

If huge bombastic plays where you throw yourself into proverbial pit of lava called the entire enemy team
*****
## Playstyles

This section is going to be divided for the different roles:

##Pocket 6v6

You are the champion of the team.  Without you, keep your medic and demoman safe, while being a front line combatant when enemies are nearby.  Only go for huge bombs onto the enemy team when you have a **clear** advantage.  Simple questions to determine that would be: Is the enemy team weak(low hp)?  Do we have uber, and they don't?  Essentially, save the big plays for when you know you can make the big plays.

##Roaming 6v6 + HL

You are the trash of the team.  Without you, you probably find yourself as a pile of giblets far too often.  Before you decide you want to bomb an enemy team, consider the questions:  Can I kill a high value target?  Can I force an ubercharge?  Will I be dead before I hit the ground?
*****
## Matchups

##Scout

The spastic twit.  Know that at a longer range, laugh at the feeble attempt to do ~30 damage to you, and wait for your move.  At extremely close ranges, know that the scout is at a severe disadvantage to your rockets.  If the scout can jump off of tall objects, predict which tall object he will land on **next** and aim for it, don't try anything high risk like random airshots.

##Soldier

Where's all that MGE training gone to?  If you are at mid-range, get a buddy to cover and fall back.  You shouldn't commit directly to a fight that will have a 50/50 outcome.

##Pyro

Only shoot rockets after you have been airblasted.  Shotguns are fine too.  The first rocket will be a mindgame with the pyro

##Demoman

Terrain determines everything.  If you are relatively close, remember that he is trying to lead you with shots.  All you have to do is learn how to become un-leadable.  Try to be very unpredictable, so he cannot land shots easily.  If you decided you want to run away, running directly away is usually a terrible idea, as he will start to shoot ahead of you, so this would be a good time to juke to different directions.

##Heavy

Never engage head-on unless you have a clear advantage: he's almost dead, disconnected.  Elsewise, coordinate with teammates to bring him down via focus fire.  If you try and 1v1, or bomb a heavy, you will die, and it will suck.

##Engineer

In most situations, then apply rockets to sentry until sentry is deconstructed.

##Medic

Go crazy.  Easy stuff

##Sniper

Sight lines will suck.  Don't give him sight lines to shoot at you.  Preemptive planning will get you around every potentially disasterous encounter.  Short range needs no explanation.

##Spy

Spy is all preemptive planning as well.  If you give a spy no chances to backstab you
*****
##Loadouts

For 6v6, and Escape plan.

For HL, you can consider the escape plan as an alternative.  If you run the whip, when you are dead, look at teammates respawn times.  Ask anyone coming up with you to stay with you to whip, or else they will outrun you after a few slaps.

Additional HL toys to consider are the black box, which brings most of the firepower of the RL, and does give you some unique ranged sapping power.
*****
## Practice and Refinement

Playing a soldier is very straightforward.  We shoot rockets and blow people up.  My recommendations for soldier DM-practice would be:

* MGE
* Pubs
* Pugs
* Shotgun heavy

I recommend shotgun heavy for one main fact.  The slower your class is

Also note that airshots are not a massive part to soldier play.  Sure, but in the end, having an incredibly soldier ground-based DM is much more important, as it is the standard method of combat you will see.
*****
##Improving gamesense

The quickest way to knowing what you did wrong is examining it.  Most people will tell you to record a demo

With this note

* Play as you normally do
* Die as you rarely do
* While dead
* Did you do something wrong that lead to this?
* Could you have done something different?

Reflecting on the past life is much easier, and makes use of the boring respawn timers anyways.
*****
## Rocket Jumping

Rocket jumping is a part of the soldier culture.  The first three things a soldier learns are how to shoot a rocket

However, or C point of gravelpit, then you win.  No more jumping is required.  Everything else is flashy and rarely required.

Double however

*****
## Rollouts

Obviously only a big deal on 6v6 maps

* Learn the quick route from the pros
* Practice these routes
* If you aren't comfortable with a jump,False,,t5_2stfn,1343855977.0,,flair-soldier,t3_xiwd9

In our game:

The enemy team had full knowledge of this (engineer had a teleporter for the pyro for this purpose)

Players are not allowed to use any map texture flaw to their advantage, placing explosives of any kind in texture flaws, **shooting thru a flawed prop or door** (What's with the spelling?...).

Today, and what to expect of them in the future.

We start our text based journey long ago, and dare I say, no hats.  April 29th, 2008 rolls around, and the first unlocks are released for the medic.  Shortly after comes the pyro update, and then a heavy update.

Between these 3 updates we are issued a total of 9 new toys to play with, but at the price of being very vulnerable.  The pyro's short range hampered his(its?) power to deal with enemies at a distance, so here comes the flare gun to create long range openings, but reduce his mid-range capabilities.  The heavy's stupidly huge health bar could be a detriment between fights, meaning he could not hold the fort on his own.  Here comes the sandvich, healing 120 HP per snack break, unthrowable, and can take the munching time to be ready between fights.  The sniper is a class that is hard to properly deal with, designed to bring the sniper closer to the fights



All of these weapons were designed specifically for making the game flow better, we have weapons that have a designed model first, followed by random stat assignment to make them have a different feel from primary weapons, usually being a +x% stat, and -y% stat to compensate, which often will get plugged into a ""will this help me out more in most situations"" question, and then the future of the weapon is determined, or always off item.

##Introduction

Hello thar!  My name is Frank, whether this be mumble, skype, or even the in-game voice chat.
*****
##What is communication?

On a most basic level, and there's nothing you can do about it.  Even now, you are compelled to continue to let me do it.

Communication is a means to convey information to and from your team.  This should primarily be done via a VoiP system as mentioned in the introduction
*****
##Why is communication important?

Communication is required so that we can distinguish ourselves from cavemen.  Without a form of communication

Have you ever tried to go for a sweet frag video clip on top of 4 enemy players, this is the time to start communicating.  Actually, ten seconds ago was when you should have started, but I'm not asking you to time travel here.  Communication can help your team play as a team, considering your team is playing a team-based game that is called Team Teamtress Team.
*****
##Transitioning from pub to competitive

The easiest way to make a transition from pub to competitive in the communications department is simple.  Find a friend or two, play as a pack:  Let everyone know almost everything that is happening(note: the almost is for things that probably are not appropriate to tell them, like what color underwear you are wearing, and if your grandma is on fire).  Simple communication practice like this will bring you a large step closer to the behemoth that is competitive communications.
*****
##Good communication habits

The best habit to communicate is to make it a habit to communicate.  Start swirling down that rabithole for a moment darling

Ok time is up.  Time for some actual tips on communicating information.  Also understand that this is a generalist role

* Current uber%
* BEFORE you make an attempt to suicide pick on a high value target
* When you have dealt massive damage to a single target
* When you see a push coming in
* When you see the enemy falling back
* Oddities(ex offclassing in 6s
* Any class killed

All C-Script is is a variation of the ""record"" command with a few extra bells and whistles for convenience. It will generate three demos in any given situation; one for the first half of your match, one for the second half, and, a final one for extra time.

* **Why is this better than P-REC?**

**It's not**. It's merely intended as a replacement that does not require plugins or file customisation. The good news is that C-Script will never break unless Valve makes significant changes to the demo system.

* **How do I use it?**

Match starting? Press F1. First half finished? Press F1! Second half? Guess what

Then, this stops you spamming the button and overwriting your recordings by mistake.

1362330470.0,19kzns,On mentoring **bad** players. Snowflake story inside.,FrutBaskins663,74,16,43,"Hello all

I wanted to share an issue I had a few months ago

A little bit about me: Playing 4 years now

I took on a role as a mentor to a player who's never played competitive but interested in highlander

----------------------------

**The story:** 

Two weeks ago, so the ones who are up to no good like cabering demos or engies who place level 3 sentry at spawn have no reason to go there. There's a higher skill standard, basically. But that day, a newbie sniper, let's call him **Newb**, joined the server. Obviously at the end of a 15-minute round he bottom-fragged, earning less than a dozen kills while some of us were pretty close to 200.

As some snipers who frequent these servers know, and get an occasional headshot every couple minutes, which is pretty much a fraction of what a normal player gets in that timespan. It was obvious he did not have much experience playing in the servers.

Throughout the match he asked for tips. No one really answered. Occasionally someone would give a tip or two but the surprisingly good thing about it all was that no one was being mean to him. After the match, and had the luxury of learning from a great sniper when all I had to do was ask. So I figured there was no problem trying to do the same (not implying I'm great or anything).

Fast forward a week later, there are some problems I've been repeatedly pointing out to him. These are the two most prominent ones:


1. **He's been challenging people left and right

I find this to be juvenile, padding his rating/stats and showing those who kicked his ass in the past who's the boss. 

I've emphasized the pointlessness of the whole thing, similar to how some people learn bad habits in MGE.

I've tried to tell him these things but he doesn't seem to listen :(.

2. **He tries to drag me into a problem of his

Those who've seen it know it can get pretty serious :(. Apparently

I understand there's hundreds of invite-only groups out there, he'd ask, *""Do you know ***[**insert my name here**]***? Can you beat him in 1v1?""*.

Some of these guys are my friends and know the situation, honest to god not. I've repeatedly asked him not to do this, but I feel uneasy every time he sends me an invite to an mge server with a bunch of N-guys in it.

To make matters worse, join a top clan and be the best""*.

As ridiculous as it sounds, or I helped him too much.

------------------------------

In retrospect I regret lending a hand to this guy. I'm proud of the fact that I changed him in a week from a crouch-walking, ""This is what happens when you help someone who doesn't need to be helped"". I think I now understand what that means.

I also knew it would be a thankless job, distressing effect on me.

I think the best course of action for me right now is to start creating distance. I've given him lots of resources for getting better and he should be able to use those resources as he sees fit. I also managed to get him into a backup slot for an Iron team so if things go well

//Fake Reloader

bind ""MOUSE3"" +fakeswitch

alias +fakeswitch ""slot1;+reload""

alias -fakeswitch ""-reload;slot3""


HOW TO USE:

1. Start off by having a revolver that actually needs to be reloaded. The best way to find one of these is to trade with another spy who has already fired their gun that round.

2. Disguise yourself.

3. Hold MOUSE3 (or whatever key you bind) to switch to revolver and begin reloading. Hold it until you hear the first click of the revolver's reload. Don't hold too long or you'll complete the animation (which will obviously fill your revolver clip). 

4. Releasing MOUSE3 switches to your knife, engies, &lt;anyone who has to reload one projectile at a time&gt;.

1348130931.0,106n0z,On the viability of pyro in 6v6,bamfusername,69,8,107,"Yeah yeah reddit pyro-boner. Let's move past that

---

Now

&gt; Hello, just like sniper, and to a lesser extent spy.

&gt; The main reason you don't see pyros is because 6v6 is not a game of class vs class like highlander is (which is great for highlander). 6v6 is more engine based than class based. By that I mean in 6v6 you see which 6 players can best another 6 based on their skill within the game using all the tools available to them under the given rule-set. The short point there is that pyro is a tool

&gt; Nevertheless

&gt; Personally I think the pyro is perfectly equipped to function in 6v6 now more than ever. This is why when I need to backup for LG I try to use the class as much as I can before they yell at me to stop ""goofing off."" When I made ""meet the proro2"" there was no flare crit and no degreaser—and thus no faster reflect. Also (and this is the main advantage of the weapon imo) there was no fast weapon switch.

&gt; You need to micro-manage all 3 weapons very efficiently on pyro and the degreaser makes this possible. This is important because you do not need to puff

&gt; This all leads up to the biggest advantage pyro now has, pull off excellent airshots, and DM players who might be hurt. You can choose to light them on fire, then push them in the air and crit flare them, or push them into a corner and axe them, or flare them once from far away and then flare them again to crit kill them (all while having enough time to switch back to the degreaser and protect yourself with the airblast). This has major influences on how a team can move around the map if their players are being flared, pushed



&gt; Point is, for pyro to truly be useful (just look at how effective I can occasionally make it just by spamming flare in the enemies direction and hoping they get hit). 

And some somewhat similar thoughts echoed by tyrone:

&gt; I skimmed through this thread and wanted to put in my input. If you pull it off successfully, heck, I know some incredible players that can play pyro at ridiculous levels, easily making it a viable class in pick up games and such. At the top levels it doesn't seem to work because no team has truly committed to that approach. If a pyro is used, I think the class make up structure would change a bit, you would maybe have him pocket with a scout, and have the soldier demo roam. (I'm purely theorycrafting at this point) I don't think pyro is being used to its fullest abilities, its just not being unlocked in 6's due to the 'utility' stigma and players being more comfortable on the cookie cutter classes.

So open mvm_mannworks.pop in your favorite text editor. Scroll down to wave 1

_______________________

Now we gon' get fancy. Let's say you hate yourself and want to fight 5 Giant Rapid Fire Soldiers at the same time. Let's also say you also think they don't fire quite fast enough. However, and rename it **T_TFBot_Minigun_Rockets**, because he's practically gonna be shooting rockets as fast as a minigun. Change the **Name** field to whatever you want to show up in-game. Head down to **fire rate bonus** and see that it's 0.5. That means he's firing at twice his normal rate, or the gap between shots is 0.5 as long as normal. Let's change that to 0.1. Now we have our very own robot that fires super fast and is an entirely different entity than the original Soldier Spammer.

Head back over to the Mannworks pop file. Erase everything inside the **TFBot** brackets (Class, **SpawnActive**, and **MaxActive** to 5. Bam!

Now you play a bit and decide that wasn't hard enough. You think what they really need is a bunch of uber medics

    Squad
    {
      TFBot
      {
        Template T_TFBot_Minigun_Rockets

      TFBot
      {
        Template T_TFBot_Medic_QuickUber
      }
    }

Awesome, **SpawnCount** to 3 because we want three bots at a time, **MaxActive** to 15 because we want to send them out regardless of if the player has killed previous ones, and **WaitBetweenSpawns** to 7 because they are getting spawned every 7sec. Also, because we're so nice and this was a tough round, we'll give the players some more cash by changing **TotalCurrency** to 500 under WaveSpawn

---

I'm a bit romantic when it comes to weapons in TF2. Whenever someone in /r/NewToTF2 asks, some are no-no*

However, but I think the weapons themselves are not the problem. I like to think that all weapons are merely *refined* tools for a more particular playstyle, which is why all of them have some sort of upgrade and downgrade: to encourage certain actions and discourage others.

I think the problem for weapons like the Backburner

1. Their **intended** playstyle requires a certain level of skill, puff-and-sting, etc.)
2. The rest of the community. This game, which means the way the community plays effects how the community responds.

I don't think that the weapons are bad weapons *per se* but because of these two big reasons. Number 1 is why ""crutch"" weapons exist: you can use them before you have the skills and mental set for their *intended* use and then the playstyle defines the player, enough skill to switch between playstyles according to the needs of the team with minimal ""losses"") We've all seen it: many pro players using the vanilla loadouts with one or two unlocks and switching depending on what the team needs.

Number 2 is hard(er) to prove, it's true) and that has an effect on how others and you play.

There is a problem with overpowered weapons and I won't deny that

Does this situation have a solution? Not that I can see, at least, that means we're having a relatively short supply of Caber Jumpers. Damn scots, they ruined Scotland!)

## What is a midfight?

Did you answer this question with ""Who doesn't know what a midfight is?""  Well guess what, and where you should direct your praise for me informing you.^1

The first thing to be concerned on the topic of a midfight is straightforward.  Any 5cp map and any KOTH map will always start up with a midfight.  Something that you probably did not think about, you probably think that because this point isn't the middle, that it shouldn't count, but here is something to consider:  A midfight is a situation where both teams will be battling over a single point, and both teams will(generally) be fighting with all of their men, in one large fight.  After this definition, you can see that a midfight, and now you can reflect on how your team that fails at midfights is also failing on last fights.

^1 ^Redirect ^all ^praise ^to ^comments ^below.
*****
## Why should I be concerned about a midfight?

I honestly can't even think of a joke for this topic.  You should damn-well know how important midfights are.  Especially if your team is having a rough time fighting for mid
*****
## How can I prepare for a midfight?

Preparing for a midfight as a team requires communication.  If you have all of your plans laid out, because if your team is split 50/50, and one half reaches a bulk of the entire enemy team, that half will be crushed quickly, and the other half will be forced to either fight at a loss, or give up and retreat.
*****
## What should I do during the midfight?

Let's break it down by class/arrival time:

##Demoman:

Arriving early?  Get out stickies and keep to your side.  Work to contain the enemies as they arrive.  Arriving late?  Ask your scouts to back you up.  Use your long range spam to deal damage

##Scouts:

Upon arrival: Is your demoman safe?  Push up and contain the enemy players.  Containing the enemy team is a key method to shutting them down at mid.  Is your demoman not safe?  Make him safe

##Soldier:

Welcome to the midfight, but will leave your team down a player, is a very risky situation.  Wait until you have a clear advantage before you go to dive for something crazy.

##Medic:

I think the healing/ubering part is pretty much understood already, make sure you top him off.  Understand that standing incredibly near a choke-point gives you a false sense of security.  Sure, you can fall out very quickly, but it creates a situation where you HAVE to fall out as soon as you are attacked.  Support your team, and they will support you.
*****
##What are some outcomes to the midfight?

If your early players (demo, they can for their mirrors back into a choke situation, and effectively contain them outside of middle.  Alternatively, if your team loses players or gets hit hard early, you might want to consider backing out, as your team will be seriously disadvantaged, and trying to push back out of a choke that people are watching is suicide/ubercide.

If the midfight pans out slowly, they will also show their injuries indirectly, like Escape Plan running, or bee lining towards a health pack.  Make calls when these events happen, and give your roaming soldier and scouts the go ahead to try and force the enemy team out or uber earlier than planned.  If your team is taking too much damage to sustain, consider leaving and hanging on to your uber/surviving players, as committing to a losing fight can mean losing not only mid
*****
##How do last fights differ?

Well, and it can be incredibly volatile.

Often, and needs to change, so let's break down what needs to happen on a last-point offense:

What do we want to do?  Capture last.  How can we achieve this?  Getting men on the point.  How can this be done safely?  Kill people.  What's the easiest way to kill people?  When they are clumped up.

So, thus drawing enemies towards the point.  Also note the spawn time for a defensive player on last.  If it is 15 seconds, that means you have exactly 15 seconds of time from the moment you kill your first enemy at last before you should seriously consider backing out and attempting the push again.

Defending last?  Read above

1365604241.0,1c2bmh,About the metagame: An analysis and explanation,LfbFrank,72,18,66,"Man it's been a while.  Today's lesson is on the metagame

*****

##What is a metagame?

A metagame is, it is how we use what we know about the game to better shape how we play the game.  Essentially it is us using our vast knowledge to shape and mold the most optimized level of play.  The best example is the extremely cookie cutter standard of 6v6 that we all know and love(and offclassers hate).

*****

##Things to understand about the metagame

I am going out on a limb here by saying the following:  The metagame has never once changed because someone came to /r/truetf2 and said ""I dislike this stale metagame.  How about we do X/Y/Z?

This is an important concept to understand.  Metagaming never changes because people want to ""shake up"" the meta.  It changes exclusively when a better answer is tried

Sure, but the key factor is that the people that do this are bringing in tons of time of trying, testing, and proving, of a new idea to the table, and then framing the meta around it.  The typical thought process from an outsider is backwards:  I want to think up a new meta, then prove how it is better

*****

##Learning from other games

Metagame evolves most rapidly from games where having an optimal strategy are required.  Minecraft, don't try and dispute).

On the other hand, I will murder your family), which is League of Legends.  In LoL, there is a fairly strict metagame that has evolved.  It puts archetypical roles in the different positions based on how they can best use that position to their advantage.  In by no means is this metagame perfect, we see the pro players diverging from the system all the time go gain ground in specific situations.  It is important to note that by trying to switch around which champions go where, the emergence of a new metagame arises.

*****

##Rules and metagaming

Let me get this straight, 1 of X/Y/Z.  Those specifically are rules imposed by the league itself to spice up the gameplay.

A parallel can be drawn to something like basketball, which isn't fun for anybody.

*****

##Highlander

Heyo my highlander homies.  Note number 1: Highlander has no **class** metagame.  It is by definition impossible to have a metagame where all 9 pieces are glued to the board, it just shifts the focus in another direction.

The entire metagame of highlander focuses on the positioning of the players, but that isn't a problem.

Item metagame is the most evolving of the HL metagame.  With an increase in player size, don't make it one), different weapons show themselves as having possible uses.  The best example would have to put down on the black box.  It came to light with tons of scrims and games of testing and proving that this terrible-in-6s rocket launcher alternative could be so damned useful in highlander.

##The Point

I didn't really have a point for this one,,False,,t5_2stfn,False,,True
1361128634.0,18pc8o,Heavy in Highlander: a Beginner's Guide to Success,DeliriousCookie,70,17,23,"So you've picked what class you've wanted to play in highlander for your first time (or you were forced to in my case) but you've never played him before in a serious game setting (lobbies don't count). You're probably thinking to yourself ""Golly gee this will be so easy

**WRONG.**

Heavy is the second most important class in highlander (medic being the most important). Now before you close this page just read on to see why.

Heavy has one job

Now that's a massive responsibility. Heavies need to ensure that their medic is well oiled and lubricated and have to ensure the safest route for your helpless little friend.

To do so you need to know your tools. The first two should be the only ones used and should never ever be changed as they provide the maximum amount of flexibility and support to your team.

**The Minigun:** Reliable

**The Sandvich:** The one thing that makes medics love you more than anything. They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. This is entirely true. Now toss those things at your partner in crime. On another note

**Gloves of Running Urgently/Fists of Steel:** VARITATION

Before I go on further

**Spy:** Now you have your minigun revved and are currently unloading twelve tonnes of metal into the enemy's faces when suddenly you feel cold steel and a sharp pain in your back.
Heavies need to spycheck and know if the spy is behind them. Dying to spies shouldn't happen unless you've made a choice to die to one (for example: you know he is behind you but you want to get that last bit of damage off on the enemy heavy to ensure a easy clean up to for your team). If you're dying a lot to spies the solution is quite simply check your back more and have your medic do the same (as he is more free to look around).

**Snipers:** As a heavy you only have one way of dealing with these annoying Australians which is simply avoid them. Take a flanking route or call them out to ensure that your medic knows where he is to avoid him and so that your sniper (or other equivalent pick class) can take them out. If this is not an option
Medics: Really?

**Engineers:** Even if you are overhealed you can only really effectively take down sentries at close range

**Heavy:** This section boils down to simply who spun down first and who has the most support from their team. Once you have your minigun revved down you've committed to killing the heavy and unspinning your gun at that point is useless and stupid. If you think you're going to lose the gunfight

**Demomen:** These sons of bitches are pains in the ass to deal with. Unless you have a straight shot at him you usually will be able to kill him before you do. However you will mostly have trouble dealing with demomen when they are around corners. Now, the best way to deal with a demo is by retreating. If you think you're not taking too much fire and/or have über, then plough right through and go for gold.

**Pyro:** Heavy is a hard counter to pyro

**Soldiers:** Because the soldier almost always takes the role of a roaming soldier in highlander

**Scout:** The mighty scattergun. Three shots and you're dead. Good scouts are a massive problem for the heavy as they can easily slip past you and two shot your medic. On top of this

Now that you know how to deal with each class you get in game and... Oh no... Your medic wants to run kritz and pocket the demoman. Now what?

Simple. Your role hasn't changed a bit. You still stick with your medic and you ensure that they are not harmed. This is because demomen are really bad at protecting things

Finally

Since you're constantly protecting and moving with the Medic, since you two are two of the most important players on your team.

Now you're ready to take on the world with all their dangers but remember that if your medic dies you're the only person to blame

1330135738.0,q4xu9,See what buttons (actions) players are pressing in their demos.,,62,5,26,"Hey guys. A while back (near enough to truetf2's birth)

I came up with this - http://www.reddit.com/r/teamfortress/comments/m0i9z/retrieve_button_presses_from_a_demo_file_with_tick/

However

I just figured out another way that you can achieve something similar within tf2.

**You need these four console commands:**

* `developer 1`

 this spits out the console output in the top-left corner of your screen while playing / spectating (may vary depending on HUD of choice)

* `demo_debug 1`

 as explained in the linked post

* `con_filter_enable 1`

 we want to be able to remove all the other junk from the console output about player deaths and unbounded objects and things

* `con_filter_text ""dem_consolecmd""`

 this will only show lines with player commands

As a result

The output format is [tick] dem_consolecmd [action][key]

I don't exactly know what numbering system the keys are using... they're not ASCII, comment below.

Now if you're watching a particularly dexterous player, so if you get to an especially interesting section, it's probably best to slow things down using demoui or whatever.

Frankly this is extremely nerdy and probably of little benefit

&gt;Please don't shit on me just because eXtine felt he had to. The extent of him ""talking to me"" was ""hey want to cast the LAN? djc/cbear and hopefully Lange are casting"" and I said ""sure."" That was about 2 weeks ago. I had very little knowledge of what went on behind the decision to cast the LAN on extv's channel rather than ESEA-Orange and I assumed it was because ESEA wasn't going to let them. When I found out that the opportunity to cast on the Orange stream was still there I was pretty pumped and I really didn't think it would cause any sort of drama or whatever. I'm kind of along for the ride so please stop the conspiracy theories about what I did to betray extine because this is the entirety of what went down:

Week to week you will get anything from early alpha versions of a person's first map

Either way you can expect to experience a variety of game modes and map styles in a couple hour period.

I have my first map in the playtest this week (ctf_torch2_a1) so I would be grateful for any playtesters willing to give it a go.

Thanks!

Now

#1: To actually get an advantage out of this, so how much does this really matter?

#2: I have pretty good reflexes and aim with this weapon, or Heavy comes up to me in urgent need of healing I can normally whip out the Crossbow, shoot them, and get them back to the front lines much faster. However I'm not going to pretend I don't miss every now and then, and when I do I've wasted valuable time and haven't actually done anything. Even though I get the heals more often then not, is it worth the risk I might miss?

#3: During some rollouts (most notably Granary) I feel like I can help roamers get to the frontlines faster by shooting them after they've used up their buff without neglecting any other teammates. I don't miss when I do this since I know exactly where the roamer is going to be (although sometimes a Scout runs into the arrow) and I don't feel like I'm missing out on much uber. Is this a viable rollout strategy

#4: One of my favorite parts of the Crossbow is my ability to heal Soldiers using the Escape Plan. Now, so I just wanna know if there are any situations I should look out for.)

#5: Finally, and I feel like I've used it to my advantage when I'm glued to a Heavy, but frankly I don't know for sure. I feel like it's a good idea, and the math makes sense, but I'm worried I'm missing something.

Teams are randomly allocated into groups of four where they play in a round

Season Three was an awesome display of ragdolls and giblets with the EU division lovingly covered by [VanillaTF2](http://redd.it/qijym).

Season Four with its 19 NA teams and 31 EU teams promises more blood, more pew pew, more giblets and more utter carnage. We've got some more experienced teams like Looking Handsome, Garage Gaming Fest and last season's NA winners Free Frag Network *offclassing* as their worst classes so if anything that should be *hilarious* to watch. 

As we have an NA team without a server [Kritzkast](http://www.kritzkast.com/) have been total bros and lent us a sever for play on Sunday!

They're involved in some awesome stuff for the community like [TF2Mix-Up](http://tf2mixup.com/page/Donate) that pits celebrity against celebrity with a few community members in a for fun Highlander game.

1375371505.0,1jhzoi,Evaluating a pick and acting on it,LfbFrank,61,13,17,"Welp, not about picking people for a team.
*****
Let's start with a thought experiment.  You and your highlander team are holding just outside of the enemy's final capture point on cp_Process.  Both medics are 100% on uber, and is currently working on a teleporter.  As the offender holding the enemy with their backs to the wall, you know you have the luxury of being able to take your time and wait for the opportune moment to strike, but when is that?

Today
*****
First, you want to make sure your medic is keeping your sniper well healed so that he has less of a chance of dying, however it's not a huge problem because you have at least a level 1 teleporter, so if he dies he can get back fast enough.
*****
So your sniper gets a pick, the following classes don't warrant much of anything changing:

* Scout
* Soldier
* Spy
* Engineer

The reasoning is that most of them would not play a pivotal role in defense, are that:

* Scout: Backcap pressure relieved
* Soldier: Uber force pressure relieved
* Spy: Watching your back pressure relieved
* Engineer: If he had a level 3
*****
Obviously this leaves some classes who are worth it to kill

* Pyro: Your ubercharge won't get nullified at a choke.  You can also feel safe bringing in a solo ubercharge(ex: demo) meaning you can force a multi uber and win the war while easily escaping/bring in reinforcements when the ubers fade.
* Demo: Enemies' long range and AOE damage is severely limited
* Heavy: The combo's close range damage is severely limited
* Medic: Obviously a large blow, this means you shouldn't get killed in this occasion, because your largest advantage is being able to heal after damage while the other team cannot.
* Sniper: While this won't signal an instant battle, which can lead to another important pick and therefore a strong push chance.

It is important to note that gaining picks on multiple classes allow for an even wider array of choice.  Say for example you've picked their heavy and pyro.  Now you have the most dominant uber fight ever

##Things to know going into this guide

Well, definitely skim through the following links at a minimum.
[Communications Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/xtoqs/tell_me_about_it_a_guide_on_competitive/)

[Positioning Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/xkqvg/the_front_line_and_you_a_guide_to_competitive/)

[Of midfights and massacres](http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/z4z8w/of_midfights_and_massacres_a_guide_to_improving/)
*****
##Things to learn from this guide

In the end, and critical decisions.  Every pointer and tip will lead back to these pillars of competitive TF2, and will (hopefully) up your battlefield presence.  Do note that this guide cannot teach you how to aim, and every hour put into actually playing the class will translate into a better death match.
*****
##Mathyness!

This topic will cover a lot of mathstuffs

* Maximum rocket launcher reload time: .92 + .8(3x) = 3.32s

* Maximum shotgun reload time: 1.0 + .5(5x) = 3.5s

* Maximum total reload: 6.82s

* Time it takes for a scout to kill you from full: .625(2x) = 1.25s

* How dead you will be if you empty both weapons: Very

Things to note from this math example:

* Loaded weapons are important

* The scout *can* 2-shot you

* Never empty both weapons

* The best way to get more ammo is to blast a weapon on the ground towards yourself

*****
##Analyzing goals

What is a goal?  Well

How do we win?  Capturing something

What can make this goal easier?  Killing enemies.

I will be one of few to say that killing people for the sake of killing people is *probably* a good thing.  Sure, I don't care what they were, you've helped your team progress, and there's not much anyone can say about that.

Please note, and make your goal safer to achieve.

Always explode out your goal like the above.  Never just say ""well we need to capture their last point, and work on the plans at hand.
*****
##Commitment

I do.  Ok, and not the greatest forms of disengagement(Rocket jumping again, escape plan, walking).

Consider whether committing to a fight will end well, out of ammo, or diagnosed with baby-syndrome, you should feel secure in committing, along with bringing the rest of your team into the fray.

Committing to a fight is something that should be considered hand in hand with your goals

##Airshots?  Airshots.

Let's take a look at what an airshot is

Positives:

* Looks awesome
* Shuts down a jumper

Negatives:

* High miss chance
* Missing shots will reduce loaded ammo

So tallied up, you have buttloads of ammo ready to deal with when the jumper has landed.

What you really should not do is fire more than 1 air-attempt if you have missed, you are going to have a very bad time.

Alright, it can load and extract GCF files now (though the interface does not yet permit it) on *any* OS.

Also in the current version is the ability to modify caption files in the DAT format - once again, but it can determine most of them.

And all of this in less than 2MB! (just under half of which is because of the background image, 200K of OSX UI improvements)

###Still to do (in roughly this order):

* VMT files. So many HUD elements use these
* Localization. I'm already loading most text from a file
* Proper multi-threading: you may notice the UI freeze at times when loading some HUD elements for the first time
* The views menu - intended to load up pre-determined RES files and view them all at once in separate tabs. Includes custom views.
* Make use of the preferences panel.
* HUD installation for any HUD. Don't expect any fancy features though - it is meant to be an editor after all

###Known issues:

* The .desktop file on linux will most likely (unless you're me) point to nowhere on your system - the code also overwrites it. I need a dedicated install directory :(
* Report here if you find anything else significant or otherwise annoying.

* Fixed an issue windows users were having
* Increased logging verbosity
* Small interface changes for better compatibility

1356305450.0,15cher,Loose Cannon - actually pretty awesome?,GreenBloat,56,8,53,"My opinion so far:

Just going by the numbers

But the advantage in terms of damage isn't actually that high, it's only about half the amount, but it practically eliminates the risk of self-damage as well, and even if a roller hits yourself, it'll hit the ground first and do greatly reduced damage.

Long story short, turns it into a deadly precision tool.

The main feature, which beats the damage output of this weapon only at close range. And while it's not quite as good as the FaN at point blank, it's still better for dogfights than any alternatives.

Tl;dr:

The loose cannon can be considered the jack of all trades in terms of grenade launchers. If you're relying on your secondary to deal most of the damage, you're not a pyro either, and the knockback alone is a very valuable asset.

Server ads do not, but some people responded by saying that *that* particular server ad was fine because it catered to the competitive-minded community that we have.

The problem I have with this attitude is that it sets a precedence for other server ads. The one I just removed was a *Halloween themed server*. And while I have no problem with someone trying to drum up a little attention for their server

I think I'll formulate another post on a lesser-discussed topic that's more thought out and not written in an hour or two.**

Greetings. I'm [Rusty Bodega](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/f/fb/Sniper_cheers07.wav), this is an open discussion. Feel free to put your own opinions in here, as I enjoy conversing about game theory.]* I'll also be editing this from time to time if good ideas arise in the thread, or I need to edit for grammar/science.

**First and foremost: ""Who the f### is Rusty Bodega?""**

* I'm a Sniper for the UGC Highlander team

**Secondly: ""Why would I want to listen to you?""**

1. Because you're part (or want to be part) of the circle-jerk that is Competitive TF2. 
* Because it's 2 A.M. and you've lost control of your life.
* Because you're a sadist and find that the pain becomes pleasure over time...


So what options do we have for secondary weapons? Let's take a look:

* **Submachine Gun** - *10 shots per second at a base damage of 8. (12 ramp up
* **Jarate** - *Applies mini-crit debuff
* **Razorback** - *Nullifies a single backstab. Only recharged from a resupply locker.*
* **Darwin's Danger Shield** - *Increases max health by 25.*

Now for the discussion:

* **Submachine Gun**: Vanilla weapon. Decent for solo play (lone gunner)

* **Jarate**: What we're discussing

* **Razorback**: You'll get secretly mocked for using this in a Highlander game. Any Spy that has SOME experience in competitive can kill you with their gun no problem. At max health it takes 4 shots from a Revolver

* **Darwin's Danger Shield**: Not really worth the extra health. A non-charge headshot still instantly kills you

**And for the moment you've all been waiting to flame me for...** 

Jarate is the 'Holy Grail' of Highlander play. Why do you want to equip this bad-larry and nothing else? Mini-crits, works wonders for decloaking spies, and all around the best secondary weapon for Highlander as a Sniper in terms of team utility (other than your ability to point and click people and make [da headshots](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/6/60/Sniper_specialcompleted37.wav).)

Oh yeah

* **Crits where it would normally mini-crit.**

Now take a look at the following equation:

* *Jarate + Bushwacka = 195 critical damage.*

This kills every class but the Soldier and Heavy in 1 hit (and if the Soldier took at least 5 damage

    - Fire damage Without Bushwacka
       - Flare Gun = 30 Damage // 90 Damage if target on fire
       - Detonator = 30 Damage // ~41 Damage if target on fire
       - Afterburn = 6 Damage per second
    - Fire damage With Bushwacka
       - Flare Gun = 36 Damage // 108 Damage if target on fire
       - Detonator = 36 Damage // ~53 Damage if target on fire
       - Afterburn = ~7.2 Damage per second

As you can see, I'd say *use it*. Otherwise, Kukri works pretty well.** I generally try not to find myself in situations where I need to Jarate and melee a target that has more than 150 health.

Remember

That about ends it for this nightmare. I'll probably also edit this from time to time for the addition of more numbers and math. If I get enough positive feedback I'll do some more of these and make sure I don't half-ass it. If enough people hate it then you're saving me from wasting my free time (the power of adderall and caffeine...)^Don't^do^drugs.

1323883730.0,nckru,On Afterburn,bamfusername,58,10,15,"We all know that the original intent of fire in TF2 was to create chaos. It was meant to be visible

Naturally

Simply put

I beg to differ.

--------

A player who is actively taking damage is a player who wants to retreat. This is hardly the rule, in general, someone who is taking damage wants the damage to stop. The player will try and retreat to his own lines to heal up.

But why not just hit the player with a 60 (or 45) damage rocket? Isn't a rocket more reliable? Afterburn can be put out at any time

The difference is that afterburn seems to have a greater impact than direct damage on *everyone*. Pub players and experienced comp players alike.

We all know that a player who is taking damage is more inclined to retreat. But whether they retreat isn't just affected by how much damage is dealt. It's also about how that damage is dealt.

People seem to dislike DoT more than spike damage. 

Spike damage has a single, you can still judge your survivability. You still maintain a certain amount of control over your situation.

A Scout with 125 HP would be reduced to 65 HP if he takes a 60 damage rocket, I'm bailing.'

Either way

A Scout with 125 HP who gets lit on fire loses this control. Afterburn, anything could happen. He could, for example, walk over a roller or take a few long range scattergun chip shots and then die from the DoT because he was suddenly dropped into the HP ""danger zone"". He could W+M1 a demo and scrape by with just enough HP to live, but then die anyway. 

In addition to this

This results in a strong compulsion to finish the fight *now*. And this isn't just because of the potential for close range spike damage. Retreating from a flare pyro isn't *safe* in the way that retreating from a soldier or demo is. A flare doesn't suffer from damage falloff and a pyro can still reach out and kill you well outside his regular effective range. 

In my experience

For those who don't play MGE mod

A scout who takes

But I've noticed that scouts play differently once they're on fire. They tend to miss more. They tend to play either very aggressively or very conservatively.

One point I'd like to make here is that afterburn doesn't just affect combat classes. It messes up the heal order for medics. You're forced to prioritize scouts over heavier classes who need more heals. A medic on fire tends to play just as conservatively as a medic who has just taken 50 damage *despite the fact that his natural regen greatly reduces the damage he's taking*

----------

In addition to the direct effects of afterburn

Weakening someone is almost as good

The logic went that if someone is weak

Naturally

VALVe needs to support competitive more, once they reach those 100 hours, be able to join a ""lobby"" so to speak, from the main menu. It would be like matchmaking, only for 6 people vs. 6 people, you also have to choose a class, just like in Tf2lobby. Having 9v9 ""lobbies"" would also be great. It would also be great if they could choose the difficulties Easy-Hard, the good players WILL be playing in hard, and they will look for other players also looking for scrims. Teams will also be able to choose their difficulty level.

So
Have something similar to TF2Lobby integrated into TF2
Introduce this mode along with a tutorial of basic competitive TF2 when the player hits 100 hours
Be able to schedule scrims easily by getting a team of 6 and through matchmaking look for similarly leveled teams

COPY PASTE FROM MY REDDIT POST

Give special crate drops to players who play the new lobby gamemode. They drop on a timer

Done, you bring more people into comp tf2 for the long run thereby giving the tf2 comp community the boost it needed.

All valve really has to do is offer a special one of a kind virtual item for winning, and give it to the winners twice so they can trade it away for money or keys or whatever. Litteraly a nearly NO COST system for having tournaments, and introducing WAY more players to stay in playing TF2 for the long run. 

EDIT: Forgot to mention that every week it would drop ONE or TWO items in the crate that are strange

Also, average on a per class basis, like scout average 5-6k, soldier average 8k+, demo average 9k ish, and medic average 12k healing etc.

1335461888.0,stutd,TF2 and Interpolation,CanadaRox,54,5,37,"First off

What it does have to do with is the time between two consecutive packets.  The only things that affect what you want your interpolation time to be is your cl_updaterate

Interpolation is designed to smooth out movement in case the client doesn't receive all the information it should.  If the client knows at `t1` an entity is at `(x1, misses the packet for `t2` but then gets the packet for `t3` with the client at `(x3, y3, z3)` they are able to interpolate that data to make an accurate guess as to where `(x2, y2, z2)` are.

What your lerp/`cl_interp` does is decide how long the gap is between the packets you have received and the information you see is.  A longer gap allows more packets to be missed while still being able to make a smooth guess as to what the missing packets contained.  A shorter gap doesn't allow you to miss as many packets.  A shorter gap does allows things that aren't lag compensated to appear more accurate to you.  Hit detection between clients and projectiles (and their explosions) are not lag compensated but both are interpolated for you.  A lower interpolation time will make them appear closer to where they will be for the actual knock back and damage calculations.

So now that you understand what interpolation is, set your `cl_updaterate` and `cl_cmdrate` to 67 (the game runs at 66.6666666.... tickrate so we just round this up), your `cl_interp_ratio` to 1 and your `cl_interp` to 0.  You may be asking ""why would I set my `cl_interp` to 0?  You just told me I want 15ms lerp time"".  The answer comes from how your lerp is calculated.  The game uses the following formula to get your lerp time: `min( max( cl_interp, cl_interp_ratio / cl_updaterate ), 0.5f )`.  This means we can set your lerp time with either the `cl_interp` convar (console variable) OR the ratio `cl_interp_ratio / cl_updaterate`.  Does it matter which one you use?  Absolutely not.  Thanks to ProdigySim reverse engineering the lag compensation and interpolation code for L4D2 we know that it makes no difference at all.  I recommend doing it this way because the value of `cl_interp_ratio` can work as a guide for ""how many consecutive packets can I lose without stuff jumping around **PLUS ONE**"".  For example `cl_interp_ratio 1` would mean ""I can lose 0 consecutive packet without any issues"" and `cl_interp_ratio 10` would mean ""I can lose 9 consecutive packets without any issues"".

Okay

1. Everything is smooth and there is no major stuttering.  If this is where you are right now

2. Everything is choppy!!  This is the bad one.  If this is where you are you will want to increase `cl_interp_ratio` until things look smooth.  Once you get there

Some people will recommend using a slightly higher interp for hitscan (I've seen lots of people use ~30ms).  There is absolutely nothing wrong with doing this.  Hitscan weapons are barely affected by interpolation and will remain accurate whether your lerp time is 15ms or 500ms.  A higher value can increase the distance your melee range appears to other players as well as other players melee range to you (any competitive L4D1/2 players will know that competitive configs had to add an upper bound to lerp to prevent tanks having incredibly long arms by abusing high interpolation).  It can increase the ""I got shot around a corner!!"" feeling for both you and the person you shoot.  A jump from 15ms to 30ms isn't going to be a major change for either of these things.  The main reason people would recommend this would likely be it allows you to miss a packet without hurting your aim.  Feel free to use a slightly higher interp for your hitscan classes (scout, sniper [without the huntsman], spy).

Anyone who has read this far and understands what has been said is now an expert on interpolation and the Source engine!  You will hopefully have also known that throughout my entire explanation I didn't mention your ping anywhere.  To reiterate

tldr: Your desired lerp is unrelated to your ping.  Use: `cl_interp 0`, `cl_interp_ratio 1` and then slowly increase `cl_interp_ratio` until everything is smooth (as necessary).",,False,,t5_2stfn,1355964343.0,flair-demoman,

**Predictions**

xen &gt; AG 4-3 by highwayunicorn

Xensity are going to have a new-look roster for the new year, and I heard that Xensity asked Lange if he would play for them, so they are aiming their sights high, as expected. The loss of TicTac is going to hurt, as he has been the team's best player for three or four seasons running; anyone jumping in on short notice will probably take some time to get up to par, especially if it's someone who has been inactive for so long. Apocalypse Gaming should be able to find a good amount of kills and opportunities off of the scout play from Kapowww and squid, but something in my stomach tells me that Relic on pocket will not be much different from TicTac and mausy's play has been of solid quality so far.

Here are some ideas:

*  Would you increase/decrease the current point value of certain actions?
* Would you assign a point value to some actions that are not currently being tallied?
* Would you value the same action differently depending on some condition, etc?
* Would you add more class-specific actions that are rewarded?
* Would you change the point value of certain actions depending on the class? There is already one examples of this
* Would you consider having a 3rd person get assist points?

Remember this is still software, but they are hard to detect and most of the time they are not that worthy.

EDIT: [Here](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Score#Points) is the current list of points assigned for which actions.

I'm starting to think that most people haven't even considered the question of why certain actions were assigned a certain point value by Valve years ago and why it has barely changed (if at all). Other than a half-joke reply about points for airshots and a very solid reply about points for damage there is nothing even close to the 6 ideas I thought of in 10 minutes

People get told all the time that their place on the scoreboard or MVP list is not a true reflection of how they are doing or did on a particular round. A better scoring system would take care of some of the mismatch AND would also help the auto-balance plugins that run of lots of pub servers.

I have been on the same search for a while now, reasons for this should be obvious.

Also, etc are full of donators who get ridiculous benefits and I also find that a lot of skill-less and clueless new players (NOT ALL NEW PLAYERS, SOME ARE WICKED BEANS!) frequent these servers because they are big and popular and usually have bots on off-peak hours.

**EDIT2** - OK, it only makes the guide better!

So after playing a bit of MvM, and have also played on private servers. *Yes, I've done this on advanced2*

Please enjoy the read

**Intro** 

The Universal Golden Rule of any shooting game is ***Dont Die.*** Ran like a pansy? Doesnt matter

As a Medic, and acting as a field commander of sorts, telling your patient to GTFO when you do.

**As a Medic in MvM you have three choices.**  

* Firmly abide by that Golden rule.  *You run the Stock Medigun.*  You should have zero deaths by mission end (Quite possible)

* Slightly Bend that rule. *You run Kritz.*  You should have as few deaths as possible

* Ignore the rule. *You run Quick Fix.* No guide. Choose another Medigun.

**Continued in Comments**

* Bind for toggling to a forward spawn (if you want to retain uber or types of charge
* Binds for switching primary/secondary, next inventory and previous inventory weapon
* Bind for suicide

* Engineer: Quickbuild binds
* Sniper: option to disable the crosshair when zooming in
* Zoom in bind (changes fov+sensitivity to zoom in)
* P-Rec settings

Installation:
-------------

* Download the program [here](https://github.com/downloads/logophobia/YetAnotherTF2ConfigGenerator/YATF2ConfigGenerator-0.10.zip)
* Make sure you have a new version of the java runtime (1.6 or higher would probably work) installed
* Unzip the program and double click on the jar file to start
* Set everything up the way you want to
* Select your steam directory and username and save the configuration files to tf2
* Save the settings for further editing if you might want to change some small things later
* Use the backup button to make a backup if you have any scripts you might like to preserve

Uninstallation:
---------------

* Delete all the .cfg files inside the tf/cfg directory
* Run tf2 once with the -autoconfig flag (inside the launch options) to reset tf2 to default
* Place any backed-up cfg files back

FAQ:
----

### I am having issues

&gt; Try the following things:
&gt;
&gt; * Make sure you unzip your program before running it
&gt; * Upgrade java to its latest version (from the link provided in the installation instructions)
&gt; * Try to generate the scripts locally
&gt; * Post an explanation + screenshot (if applicable) with the crash/issue on my github page: github.com/logophobia/YetAnotherTF2ConfigGenerator or add me at steamcommunity.com/id/logophobia

### What is viewmodel switch mode?

&gt; It indicates when the viewmodel is turned off if that is set for the weapon slot:
&gt;
&gt; * Immediately after switching weapons
&gt; * After firing a weapon
&gt; * After switching strafe directions
&gt; * After either firing or strafing

### I have a feature request

&gt; Post any suggestions on the github page

### What does medic radar do precisely?

&gt; It toggles medic autocall to 150%, it will go back to its original autocall level

### How can I customize this even more?

&gt; You could try editing the original templates, the language used is ssp: http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/ssp-reference.html. After that, the program will use your editted version of the templates. 

### What other ways to customize tf2 are there?

&gt; You can install custom huds

### My ambassador crosshair disappeared

&gt; For some reason

### Changing settings inside tf2 doesn't work

&gt; The scripts that were installed now regulate most of your settings inside tf2. Change stuff through the program

Todo:
-----

* Check bind conflicts
* Live update class specific stuff in the weapons tab
* Make the GUI a bit prettier (javafx instead of swing maybe)
* Rewrite code to be a bit (a lot) prettier
* Other requests?

-----------

* When building as an engineer, the crosshairs will get out of sync, switch weapons once to fix

2. Some places are still dark. The tunnels on the right side of spawn. The large health pack room. Under sniper deck. Torches could be added to brighten things up.

4. The black lake texture looks really ugly. It should be replaced by a blue lake texture.

6. The pit is glitched so that your death cam/screen and spectating of your team takes a long time to appear. Your body also falls weirdly and lags through the bottom of the death pit.

It's been pretty successful tournament so far. We have a North American division and a European division, as we all know there can only be one. 

Each team that plays should have three games, what were you going to anyway besides play TF2. Don't say study, that's a lie. Liar! And if you say other games then you're a liar too because there are no other games. The tournament (the Team Tournament) is on the 9th of December. 

Team signups are accessible through [**here**](http://theroundrob.in/rrr6teamsignup). 

If you're not in a team or you're in a 'transition period' and you're in Europe we run a separate tournament (The Mentoring Tournament) where we place you in a team and assign you a mentor team. At the moment our sexy mentors are, It's All About the Gibus, Team Awesome and some members of Colony. Bear in mind this separate tournament is more for the newer players, so if you have any friends who are looking to try Highlander as a format send them this way. 

This tournament is on the 2nd of December and you can register for it [**here**](http://theroundrob.in/rrr6mentorsignup).

I've been screwing around with commands and, but for a while it was very glitchy, replacing large parts of maps with a green overlay.  Took a bit of digging to fix it, but it can be done with one command.

So here's how to get a clean orthographic view of a map like the one above.

1. Open a new private server or STV demo.
2. Enable cheats (sv_cheats 1)
3. Turn off your HUD (cl_drawhud 0)
4. Enter the level overview command (cl_leveloverview x

***Stock Kukri/Frying Pan/Ham Shank/Saxxy/Conscientous Objector/Freedom Staff/Memory Maker/Bat Outta Hell:***

* a solid **65** dmg per hit
* **195** dmg from a random crit


***Bushwacka:***

* **65** dmg per hit
* can random crit for **195** dmg
* **20%** fire damage vulnerability isn't good
* guarantees crits instead of minicrits (great with Jarate or with Fan-of-War or against GRU)
* if you're using the Bushwacka


***Tribalman's Shiv:***

* **32.5** dmg per hit
* **97.5** dmg from a random crit
* **8** bleed dmg per second (**4** per tick) for **6** seconds = **48** total bleed dmg
* **80.5** total dmg per hit (or **145.5** from a random crit)
* damage is not really its focus
* the Shiv is only really useful for using the bleed effect to track cloaked spies


***Shahanshah:***

* HP ≥ 50%: **49** dmg per hit
* HP &lt; 50%: **81** dmg per hit
* if you're at high hp
* if you're at low hp
* the stock kukri can deal almost as much damage in those same 2 hits and doesn't require you to be at low health
* basically, swinging constantly

The Bushwacka seems fine

* Does the Bushwacka need a nerf?
* Does the Tribalman's Shiv need a buff?
* Does the Shahanshah need a buff?

Personally, yes.

I think the only reason that everyone uses the Bushwacka is not because it's overpowered

1336934278.0,tl99a,Some great advice from Sigma (Invite NA Medic),GoldenToad,53,8,21,"**Main Calling**

a lot of calls you can make as main caller is from the feedback you get from your players
-damage numbers
-focus fire
-when they are making a flank
-when they are down
- who is picking up the medic at spawn

Too many times I witnessed that a roamer goes in for a bomb without saying, so i didn’t notice and we have slower charge or even worse our medic unprotected.

The most important thing though, listen to the feedback of your teammates and figure out why. if poeple are shouting or swearing, it’s actually good, poeple need to vent a bit of frustration, Id rather have that, then someone who just goes silent and gives up. But its your task as captain to cheer poeple up, cuase in the end, but I digress.

also if something happens and you need to improvise a strat in your head quickly

what i mean is like, and you think there is an opening through flank, you can communicate your core needs to push there AND keep like for example a roamer and scout in choke, so they just can’t cap mid while you are fighting on second with two scouts. I learned this myself cuz i used to say: PUSH FLANK NOW HURRY, and then like two scouts ran through choke and started capping. Then again, what you can also do, is have certain strats prepared already in advance, and everyone should be on the same page


====================


Main calling takes a lot of time to become even vaguely proficient at imo, realise that every call you make WONT be perfect, even more so starting out, and work with your team.

As medic I call my percentage often so the flanks will have a decent idea when we’re pushing anyway, I’ve found it much easier to spend a bit of time with your team going over pushes, walking around the map, so in-game comms and calls can be short and sharp, “go aggro right” for instance is a much easier call than “Boomeh up on crates, Kaidus go balcony, Bybben and Wltrs charge med pack….” or w/e.

You cant micro manage

I started main calling about a year and a bit ago and I’m still terrible. I was much worse. Just go for it, demo or medic up to theirs down, or full uber to them with none…FUCKING PUSH!!!!

Good luck.


===================


It seems like the main idea is the degree of autority you want to employ. I prefer a more “flat” command structure where whoever can make a call as soon as they’re certain enough of it’s viability. Since a well functioning team is expected to rarely make any bad decision a silent consensus is preferable to minimize chatter, and that’s perfectly fine. When everyone is equally well informed the main caller handles things, the other players should override, when an opertunity arised or the situation is getting out of hand. The individual player is like a feedback system. You try something, evaluate if the action put you in a more advanageous position, check how your teammates responded to your move, evaluate the possibilities, but it relies heavily on that the rest of the team let these people know what they are up to to that they can time their approach properly (skeej is pretty thorough about this. hi skeej :D). I have never been able to trust any of my own teams on this

**Momentum in TF2 - A Push Guide**

Wednesday

One of the main problems experienced by ""low"" - ""mid"" teams is a failure to understand when an opportunity presents itself. Often when spectating or ringing, or leave a demo and soldier on last against 2 freshly-spawned scouts. The words ""should we push?"" echo through the mumble as the 5s window to take a position closes and the round slips away. So, with the CEVO season underway and ESEA just around the corner, I figured I would write a bit about how to recognize and take advantage of opportunities. If you feel that you have to leave someone on the last point before you can move up, or if you don't know why you can roll a round in 2 minutes then spend 20 failing pushes to last, read on.

 
The Caller

The easiest way to keep your team coordinated is to, anyone can make a call when they see a good opportunity, but the caller has the power to cancel anything and have their plan followed. In my opinion it's best to have the medic call, as he can easily track uber and the health of your team, but in practice anyone can do it.

Unfortunately

So

 
The Basics - Picks

Whenever I play, 1 for spawn advantage, and 1 for a sticky trap. Other factors aside, being even indicates that neither team should push, +1 indicates that you can push but success is 50-50 (push but don't overextend), and +2 or more indicates that you can roll through.

For example, and your team is holding mid. You have the spawn advantage (+1), but if you don't know where the trap is (-1), you can't really push. So, say you have your roamer sit in house while one of their scouts decides to be dumb and run in there. You've now got a pick (+1) -- if you can figure out where the trap is or make the demo pop his stickies, you'll have +2 total and a solid push on spire.

Let's flip the situation around. Still badlands, and kill a scout. You have a pick (+1), but they have spawn advantage (-1) and if you don't know where the trap is (-1), you definitely can't push (-1 total). The fact that this represents is that it's pointless to be make aggressive, risky plays when you won't be able to capitalize.

Another example: you're defending badlands last 6v6 with even ubers. Their demo runs in like a fool and dies. That's +2 for the demo pick, you're really pushing at -1, so you'll fail miserably. Point: pushing 6v5 out of last is viable as long as you man up and cover exits.

Now for a few considerations. While checking the scoreboard to see who's up is a good idea, you have a window of time where those players are still useless (and in the case of the demoman, a longer window where there will be no trap). Additionally, having an advantage does not mean you can always use the same push. Imagine you have 6 up, spawn advantage, no uber, they have only a soldier and medic with uber. You have +5 on this push, but the focus of your attack should be on forcing the enemy charge and not dying rather than just taking territory. It is for reasons like this that tracking the enemy charge is important beyond just calculating whether or not to attack. A 3s charge advantage can be used to pick the enemy medic at 95% if you know you have it and they're not careful.

This way of calculating advantage applies to most maps and most points, but careful enough to get your medic back out. This is why you often see teams spend a long time poking around for an opening before pushing to gran yard. But wait, people rarely ever gets picks from spamming those doors. So why do they do it?


Momentum - Position

I'm sure everyone has experienced those awesome rounds where you chain pushes together all the way from 2 to 5, never giving them a chance to recover. A soldier who retreats with 50hp takes 10s to re-buff if you keep chipping shots at him to block crit heals. 10s! That's 25% of an uber, where the medic is healing nobody but that one lit soldier.

The position, but these are much stronger motivations for fast attacks and retreats. If you're 3v6 but all of them have 10hp, go in and you will win. If you're 2 down and falling back, but their demo overextends into your combo with his combo 3s behind him, you stop and frag that demo. If you're 1 down and don't really want to push, but the enemy demo pops a trap he just set, it's a great time to rush in (he can't fire stickies). Mistakes in position and low health/ammo are reasons to discard everything I wrote in the previous section and go for damage/kills.

Since temporary health or positional advantages are harder to read and much more situational than things like picks, and you should exploit the enemy's health as much as possible to get as many frags as you can while giving up too many frags. If you're fighting with 1 soldier against the entire set of enemy heavies, it's worth staying in long enough to put a few spam rockets on (damage them while not being damaged) then retreat. If there are scouts around to threaten a frag on that soldier or you're in a position where their superior numbers will let them hurt you more than your spam can hurt them, it's time to get out. The more experience you have paying attention to these situations, the more you'll be able to recognize and take advantage of them.

Now, sitting comfortably on top of their spawn advantage. If, however, they gain an advantage of any form -- health, ammo, position, a pick, overloading one side of the map

I feel that a lot of teams don't really understand this. It's as if players watched an invite match where there was a mid-yard stalemate on granary, when EG caps mid, they sit on it and spam the yard for 4 minutes before pushing. Next time we cap mid, we should sit on it and spam for 4 minutes."" All too often I watch a team let their advantage slip away, because they get caught in the routine of cap -&gt; move to choke -&gt; spam -&gt; move up without paying attention to the status of the other team. Or, they'll get a soldier knocked down to 100hp and wait to heal up, even if the enemy had 2 soldiers at 50. Gauging the damage the other team takes in comparison to yours and acting appropriately is extremely important.


I hope you've learned something by reading this, or complaining about my writing.

Cheers
Sigma


**Plus a little something from Taimou**

In my eyes a medic should maincall if they know the team and players well enough
A lot comes down to the medics own experience and gamesense too

I myself use sound and knowledge of past games against certain players and teams to locate my enemies so I can call everyone to push without anyone notifying where the hell are the enemy. :p

Then there’s few things/tricks that make you a better medic(Though some of these won’t help/shouldn’t be practiced

Sounds, it’s just so easy, valley is another thing then.

Little jumps that can help you survive/make you go faster to mid/surprise the enemy: In granary/gravelpit/badlands.

SO

Why are crits in the game at all? I see it as being 3 reasons.

1. Aggressive players rack up lots of damage to increase their crit chance.

2. As a sort of balance for weapons that don't crit

3. So that new players manage to kill a god-tier soldier every once in a while

Enforcing nocrits really does make the game feel better

But what if crits were just minicrits? A random crocket wouldn't be certain death

For those who haven't been keeping track

A drama post concerning the conduct of the developers of TF2Center

Firstly, and the content of that post is the antithesis of what I try to foster as a moderator. Second, it was a drama post.  Drama appears to be inevitable online, but there are good ways and bad ways to deal with it. That was the bad way. [A more comprehensive discussion of the first post can the found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1edw1d/on_the_tf2center_post/)

This leads me to the reason for the removal of the second post.

Firstly, but it is important that the privacy concerns of all users be respected. I was messaged earlier by WafflesSandwhiches about this, and feel that this alone is grounds for removal.

Secondly, the manner in which this was done was, in my opinion, inappropriate. We did not need additional personal details regarding the matter. There is rarely a need to disclose the reasons for the release of an employee. Nor did we need to know the financial involvement said employee had in the project. 

Unlike the previous modpost

I'd like to end with two comments.

Firstly

And secondly, which, in my opinion, resolves the matter, even if it is not from the mouth of the developers. Hopefully, they'll take this suggested approach:

&gt; It's very fair that they should respond to the post

&gt; TF2Center removed a member from its development team this week. We are resolving this conflict internally and do not feel that it would be appropriate to discuss this private situation in a public setting. We are continuing our hard work on this project and appreciate your concern.

1365384470.0,1bw0ar,Dr. Grordbort Weapons Discussion,ghtuy,53,15,86,"Before I start

**Soldier**

*Dr. Grordbort's Victory Pack*

&gt; Cow Mangler 5000

I think this weapon's unique abilities make it very situational. It's nice to shut off buildings like a sentry for an un-ubered Demoman push, added to its 10% base damage penalty, means that it only does 18% of the stock's damage to buildings. This is perhaps one of the soldier's most important jobs in most settings. One good thing is that it doesn't use ammo, but I hardly ever find myself out of rockets with the soldier, since any metal picked up turns into ammo. All in all, this weapon is useful for its novelty, but it is highly situational

&gt; Righteous Bison

I personally really like the Bison. It doesn't use ammo, so you have a counter for a good Pyro when you don't want to get close enough to melee (see *Suicide*) and he's reflecting your rockets. It can also hit players multiple times, so it's like having pellets from a shotgun blast. It can also light Huntsman arrows on fire, which is just plain cool. The only downside is that it only does 20% damage to buildings, but if you're a soldier, there are easier things with which to destroy buildings than your shotgun. I personally use this weapon on my primary loadout, and I'd like to hear your thoughts. *Please discuss*

**Pyro**

*Dr. Grordbort's Moonman Pack*

&gt; Phlogistonator

We all know that the Phlogistonator can't airblast, or buildings. It also has a 10% damage penalty compared to stock, and there are no critical hits. Its only real bonus is its Mmmph meter which, when full, can be activated to restore you to full health and give you crits for a short time. This weapon can be good in pubs, where you'll probably have another Pyro who can airblast. However, whenever I use this weapon, but it is quite possibly the worst flamethrower. *Please discuss

&gt; Manmelter 

This weapon is unique and, which means that you don't have to compensate as much for target movement when using it. There's no ammo, which means that you can spam with it indefinitely, if you want. Unlike the other flare guns, the projectile can't be deflected, meaning you have a counter for a good Pyro. Its Alt+Fire extinguishes players, and each extinguished player gives you 1 guaranteed crit, but this isn't a real drawback. I haven't gotten the chance to use this weapon

&gt; Third Degree

This weapon has only one different stat, but I see it as being good for rare Medic picks. Other than that, I'm not really sure what sets it apart from any other melee. *Please Discuss*

**Engineer**

*Dr. Grordbort's Braniac Pack*

&gt; Pomson 6000

Pew pew pew. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, when it hits a Spy, drains 20% of his cloak. You saw a flicker of movement? Shoot there, you may discover a Spy! If not, no worries. It doesn't need ammo, like many of the Grordbort weapons. It can also drain 10% of a Medic's Ubercharge, which is useful if you see a Medic and Demoman coming towards you. It also can't be deflected. However, and it only holds 4 shots per clip

&gt; Eureka Effect

This is a wrench for the Engineer that only has 2 different stats. on right click, you'd better take out your demolition PDA, because you'll have to erect a dispenser somewhere else. This is good for defense, when you're not trying to push your position, but on offense, you're better off with the Jag. *Please discuss*

So we know its stats, and insta-kills scouts that are overhealed, I'm just gonna give a list of what it's great at doing. I believe it is the perfect roamer weapon to run because with escape plan, you're likely to die anyways.

* Drops ubers because it instantly kills
* It is great for what I call, and pull out your market gardener and slash them for 65/70+195 which instantly kills an overhealed demo even if he had taken NO damage previously.

* It is perfect for killing distracted pockets or medics.

* Great for denying jumps if you know a soldier will do a chain jump so he can't react to an airshot.

* With the combo gardening tactic

 
Now obviously, and lets you easily get airshot). My personal favorite is for destroying distracted demos because you land one gardener and one rocket, and even on a COMPLETELY overhealed demo it WILL kill him. It is the best weapon for just destroying pockets.

DISADVANTAGES: ITS NOT A FUCKING ESCAPE PLAN.

And thought I might say as well, just jumped, or is in midair when you garden him, he will eat the 195 damage plus about 25-40 fall damage.

So that's my mini summary of the advantages of this weapon

Here's the tf.tv post:

http://teamfortress.tv/forum/thread/981-rayshud/12#post-355

&gt;**rayshud v3.5 is out!**

&gt;It includes the following changes:

&gt;-An alternate font that gives the 6s and 9s more pronounced curves. (They don't cut off half way). ***[NOT YET IN INSTALLER]***

&gt;-An indicator to show who's currently captured the central control point in a KOTH map.

&gt;-Fixed the winpanel dropshadow for the red team's score not being transparent to match its blue counterpart.

&gt;-A completely redesigned main menu.

&gt;-A completely redesigned backpack/loadout screen.

&gt;-A completely redesigned Mann Co. store.

&gt;-A completely redesigned lobby screen.

&gt;-A completely redesigned replay screen.

&gt;-A custom console/option/server browser window that matches the rest of the menu's color scheme.

&gt;-Convenient demoui/console buttons on the main menu.

&gt;-The ability to navigate through the majority of the in-game menus with the A/D keys.

&gt;-Updated the HUD to work with closed captions. (**closecaption 1** must be set in console to enable)

&gt;-Added in an alternate health cross in which the health number overlays itself onto the cross. ***[NORMAL HUD ONLY


&gt;You can download the update here: 

&gt;https://github.com/raysfire/rayshud/archive/0dbbcf4f455ab148efea70628d6d8f5de88ce693.zip

&gt;Or via the installer by Tree ***[CURRENTLY VERY BUGGY]***:

&gt;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18079550/rayshud%20installer%20v2%20steampipe.zip

&gt;___________

&gt;**ABOUT THIS UPDATE:**

&gt;*Album of new changes:* http://imgur.com/a/Fk7Ho

&gt;So, even though I was doing nothing but this for literally two weeks of my life when I streamed. 

&gt;As far as the installer and everything is concerned: While its technically working on the installer, great, but if not, it'd really be helpful to both Tree and myself if you could grab the attached log.txt file that's generated in the same folder of the installer, throw its contents in a pastebin, and paste it in this thread so we can determine where things are breaking.

&gt;As far as the options to choose which version of the HUD font you use, so we can potentially see those coming out in later installer versions.

&gt;___________

&gt;**TO INSTALL THE NEW HEALTH CROSS:**

&gt;[Health cross image](http://puu.sh/43rYM.jpg)

&gt;In order to install the new heatlh cross, (so in many cases it's ""tf/custom/mystuff"", or ""tf/custom/rayshud"")

&gt;Once there

&gt;Once you've found them, right-click the file labeled ""HudPlayerHealth-broeselcross.res"", and rename it previous file's name, simply ""HudPlayerHealth.res"". If you're in game, you should then type ""hud_reloadscheme"" into console. If not, then start up the game and you're good to go.

&gt;___________

&gt;**TO INSTALL THE ALTERNATE FONT:**

&gt;[Alternate font image](http://puu.sh/43rJy)

1359161532.0,17aga1,Do you take Tightrope seriously?,MisterChippy,41,3,62,"This is something that I've been wondering about for a while. For those of you who don't know

http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Tightrope

Now, and I'm dubious of the qualifications of their testers. Namely that they're just anyone who plays on their servers and goes on their forums. Now while a community run beta is a good idea, I'd have to say that the community running the beta should be one that knows about the game. Remember that SPUF is a part of the TF2 community too, and a very large part at that. I just can't kick the feeling that Tightrope is essentially just where motivated SPUF users go to try getting their crazy ideas implemented.

Now, I still can't bring myself to take Tightrope seriously. I was wondering if you all felt the same way I do, or if I should just get over myself. Also, no matter if you take Tightrope seriously or not I'd still like to hear your reason for feeling the way you do. ",,False,,False,t3_17aga1
1357945589.0,16en7h,UGC Season Starting Soon :: A guide for new teams,UbiquitousMan,44,7,27,"The next season of the UGC is approaching fast! Here is a guide for new and returning teams to help them get off on the right foot.


First a word to those teams returning for next season: make sure your team leader has set your team status as READY so that you will be scheduled here in the coming weeks and allow us to sort and organize the divisions with a clear understanding of all the teams who are returning. To see if your team's status is set to ready


As always
I would also recommend every team leader watches [Moose's Walkthrough Video for Team Leaders](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Ou0oYhBoy-E)



**IMPORTANT DATES**
Highlander season starts **JAN. 21st**
6s season starts **JAN 23rd**



Thinking of adding a team still? There is still time!!
Dont have a full roster? There are TONS of people looking to join a team [HERE](http://www.ugcleague.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=6)




**Divisions**


* Platinum: This is the highest division for both 6s and Highlander. Almost all the players have multiple seasons under their belt. The cream of the crop.
* Gold: NEW This is a new division for highlander. It is comprised of all the returning Platinum teams from last season with a record under .500 and all the returning Silver teams from last season with a record over .500 plus a few tip top Steel
* Silver: Highlander division. Will be made up all the Silver teams from last season without winning records + all the Steel teams with winning records who were not moved up to gold + the top Iron teams of last division. Players in Silver mostly have at least 1 or two seasons of experience. They understand the concepts within competitive TF2.
* Steel: Steel division has always been one of the largest and diverse divisions in the UGC. There is a steel division for 6s and well as Highlander. Steel teams are made up of a wide range of skill levels from a few Plat players hanging out with their friends and ESEA pros
* Iron: Highlander division. New teams start here. This is a division for new players and teams to the competitive scene. Its where you learn about comp tf2


*A Note About Divisions*  A lot of teams were moved or have requested division changes. We are waiting to see the total number of teams coming back and what the rosters are going to look like on each team. The divisions are not what they were last season either. If you were a high steel team last season, and moving teams as well if we believe they are placed in the wrong divisions currently. We will start by looking at your previous record in your past division followed by your roster and their individual past experience. We can not take into consideration anyone saying they are offclassing or just riding the bench. If your on their roster you will be counted towards that teams strength. 



**What do I need if I want to make a team?**

* New team sign up forms can be completed here: http://www.ugcleague.com/join.cfm
* Teams are asked to have their own private server with 13 or 19 slots for sixes and highlander respectively. The additional slot is for the Match STV recorder which records .demos of all your games. The UGC does have servers availible for teams who can not provide their own but they fill up quick so be sure to email your admins to reserve ASAP.
* Get the UGC files on your servers. Visit the [Highlander Files](http://www.ugcleague.com/files_tf2h.cfm) or the [Sixes Files](http://www.ugcleague.com/files_tf26.cfm). You will need the right config file for each game type. The rcon command to exec the files in game is: rcon exec (CONFIG_NAME.cfg)  for example: rcon exec ugc_HL_koth.cfg  PLEASE NOTE: You need to restart the map after you exec the config to make sure its running properly!
* You can also download all the maps needed for this season on the Files page. The maps being played are: For [6s](http://www.ugcleague.com/maplist_tf26.cfm)
* Log into your leader login on the site, requests, pass server information. All that information is in Moose's video linked above.
* After your match **REPORT THE MATCH SCORE**!! If you do not report the match score right after your match it could cause the match to go unreported and errors could occur. It happens every season. The winning team logs into their leader login




If you have questions on anything



Another resource players and teams have is the UGC Mentoring system. Check out the [mentoring forums](http://www.ugcleague.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=15) to find help!

Yes people! It is the:  
  
##SHORTSTOP  
Let me tell you
Lets go over what this gun actually does.  
  
* Has 42% firing speed  
* Deals 100% more damage per pellet  
* Has clip-based reload(meaning
* Has 60% fewer pellets
* Has 33% smaller clip size
* Draws ammo from the same ammo pool as the secondary pistols  
  
This gun offers a different playstyle than what the Scout usually does. Instead of running in and landing those powerful meatshots, I consider this to be a valid sidegrade to the Scattergun, but I rarely see it being used in the game. Therefor, I challenge you guys to use it.  
  
**RULES**  
There's a change in the rules today
  
* You have to play Scoutfor at least 1 hour  
* Can't change class in the middle of the challenge  
* You have to use this weapon  
* You can use whatever loadout you want EXCEPT for The Special Delivery set! I want your opinion on this gun, allowed to use the Holy Mackerel and the Mad Milk WITHOUT the Milkman hat.

**Warning** it will clear all of your replays, achievements, friends, but you will have to deal with the new player tips coming back and your favorites possibly being wiped (mine weren't). Doing this completely saved my TF2 performance because I had old commands that were fighting with new ones after I've changed my configs and upgraded machines over the last few years. 

* Right click steam icon in tray
open steam, properties, tab updates, UNTICK the option ""Enable Steam Cloud Synchronisation for Team Fortress 2"". Then go to the first tab, and click ""set launch options"" and clear ANY thats there.


* Right click steam icon in tray

Steamcloud needs to be turned OFF, if you want it or not, if you changed it or not etc. the only thing they do is up the config of your when you close the game. And of that, I'm not even sure.  I've seen things come back that I had set in a autoexec.cfg differently EVERYTIME I launched the game. No idea why it is default on. Sure would not want that.
the only settings it is NOT resetting is the ""rate"" value in the game
""steamcloud"" is saving locally the settings in: ..\steam\userdata\""xxxxxxxx""... (with a \440\ subfolder in it)

A 6 player team in MvM will likely be much more sensitive to deadweight, wandering off, or slow at clearing common infected the other players suffer. So players are quick to single out the weak player and blame them. This can be an unfriendly atmosphere to say the least, rage feeding on itself as players look to point out mistakes of others who criticized them earlier in an increasingly negative circle of resentment. If the amount of rage in MvM is anything approaching 6's lobbies, Left4Dead, or god forbid DOTA-likes then we may have some unpleasant experiences on the horizon.

Most worrying of all, keep putting 'pressure' on the enemy until they are driven back. Then you have players with a very different strategy: hold position and stay alive until they have an uber, then push in all at once with the rest of their team. 

My question is how do you think the TF2 playerbase will fair in these regards? Could two such players ever work together using a strategy one might not agree with?

Is this true and if so, is it distributed evenly on your screen and centered on your crosshair? Does that mean it's protruding closer to your head than your feet?

bp &gt; 12 5-3 by highwayunicorn

bp took one look at their slow start to scrims and said ""this isn't good enough."" They are now undefeated through four games, Lansky is cementing himself as a top pocket, and b4nny is still b4nny; there are not many bad things to say about bp at this point. Torqued are on a bit of a hot streak themselves, meanwhile, after switching up their roster with Seagull doing tons of damage and Seanbud/Justin being a surprisingly good pair as the cleanup crew. Really, the thing that has turned their play around the most is PYYYOUR finding his groove and looking like one of the best demoman in the game. Now he gets the truest test of a demoman's capabilities - b4nny. Expect bp to continue their dominance, but Seagull and PYYYOUR will put out enough damage to keep Torqued in it to the bitter end.

It's looking like the North American version is happening real soon
More providers and locations are still very welcome


**original post**

Hi truetf2!

I'm Arie from FakkelBrigade and I've made a [reservation system](http://server.fakkelbrigade.eu) for TF2 gameservers. Thanks to [a bunch of community heroes](http://server.fakkelbrigade.eu/pages/server_providers) there are now [16 gameservers](http://server.fakkelbrigade.eu/pages/servers) in 6 different European data centers to choose from. Every day about [100 reservations are made](http://server.fakkelbrigade.eu/pages/recent_reservations) and [the total](http://server.fakkelbrigade.eu/pages/statistics) reservations is getting close to 5000.

So why should you care about this system?

* Many different server locations
* Automatically loads the config and whitelist for your reservation
* Instant zip with the logs/demos of a match when you end your reservation
* Automatic uploads to logs.tf when you enter your API key
* Manual upload to logs.tf
* It's the best way to deal with TF2 match servers imo ;)

As you can see on the [servers page](http://server.fakkelbrigade.eu/pages/servers)

I've been seeing a lot of ""how do I?"" threads on forums and throughout Reddit's TF2 community. Often someone will say ""I want to learn how to do X

Listen. Friends. Announcers. Casters. CBear. Lobbies do not count as competitive play. They are more like organized and formatted pubs where [mostly] competitive players meet because they don't have enough members of two teams to schedule a PUG (and often times people are going to goof off).

Here are some essential elements that will most likely be missing from a lobby, or tournament match to actually *learn* something.

* Communication (Voice comms. Lobbyists often don't use the mic). 
* Strategy (""Which way are we rolling out?"" *\*silence*\*
* Consistent skill composition (Often people are playing classes they do not main and thus the overall skill level of the team has been lowered)

Now I'm not saying that ""playing lobbies is bad, while getting lobby experience can be good, **lobbies are not a good way to gauge your skill set**. Lobbies are a good tool to become familiar with the flow of a map - *that's about it*. You might be spending more time and energy waiting for other people to join the game, than you do getting in actual play time or having peers to share advice with.

That's why I recommend you get your butts on over to [UGC](http://www.ugcleague.com) and try to find yourself a team. Don't be shy either! If you consider yourself a lower level player, but the main point is what to understand when you are looking for in advice. Lobby counts do not equate skill or even come close to painting a picture for a possible mentor.

Valve, there's no reason why a TF2 LAN should not bring in as much attention, or even a *comparable* amount of attention, as the one shown above. Such, however, is not the case, and you're lucky if a comp LAN is even coming up.

I have met a large number of TF2 players in my life. Only a fraction of those have even been aware of comp TF2's existence. Not only have the competitive players essentially **designed comp TF2 on their own**, numerous eSports streams and casts, and more... but it's as if the comp players are having to build the hype up on their own, too. And as long as comp players feel as if they're having to struggle to keep comp TF2 alive and keep the playerbase interested despite there being minimum rewards in investing true dedication in being a great comp player... then comp TF2 will continue to be at the risk of dying.

If Valve would so much as put a button on their page or in the game itself which had at least *some* reference to comp TF2 -- something to tell TF2's huge playerbase, forgotten ghost world to TF2's pubs... I don't see *myself* as holding the passion to play any longer.

What do you all think should be done

Edit: ringl-bells brought up the point of Valve blog posts which have mentioned tournaments. I am aware of these and am incredibly happy when they do this. My problem is that these blog posts are irregular and I'm not sure what percentage of TF2 players would be exposed to current or previous blog posts at any given time. I think Valve should be providing a means of exposure for comp TF2 that is much more consistent.

AG &lt; check 2-5 by dearjohncarter

Chess Club are to the point where they cannot take bad losses. Losing to the playoff eliminated Apocalypse Gaming would definitely qualify. CC looked surprisingly adequate up against the new Mixup lineup last week, and just look a little outclassed and out of gas. I expect a pretty comfortable Chess Club win, with some pro tier gaming coming from boomer and tri.

**Predictions**

Menace to Society  &gt; The Syndicate  2-1 Courtesy of Pudding Cup

Obviously match of the week right here, but they're going to need more than confidence to stack up against the crew from mTs. Not many people will argue that xalox isn't the best demo in highlander right now and ukm has been consistently putting up very impressive frag numbers week after week. The real threat of mTs, though, lies with their silent carry--harbleu on medic. He's rarely caught out of position, he builds ubers like no one else, and he knows just how to prioritize his heals on top of calling most of the plays. The key for Syndicate to beat mTs is to keep killing harbleu and maintaining precious uber advantage. Without vhalin and ruwin to get the med picks this is going to be a very tough match for our season 8 champions. Stabby, jake

Any questions, so I dunno if I'm doing anything wrong or not. :P 

**I felt super bad about posting my updates on reddit

http://steamcommunity.com/groups/rayshud

**What's new in Version 2.9:**

* -Custom build/destroy menus (including Pipboy!).
* -Changing of the respawn timer color in the tournament spectator hud
* -A few padding errors on the tournament spectator hud.
* -Fixed team names getting cut off in the winpanel. 

**Version 2.91 hotfix:**

* -A fix for the concise disguise menu.


**Download Link** - [rayshud version 2.91](https://github.com/downloads/raysfire/rayshud/rayshudv291.zip)

Anyways, you're welcome to continue posting here. I'll probably be updating it periodically as I find more small errors, but for the most part, it's completely finished.

I may make a minmode version in a few weeks as people have asked for that, I'll make sure to keep this thing updated after every update. 

Anyways

I thought I would write down some of my observations

**Please Note: These observations have been made during comp *and pub* gameplay

* Heavy

Someone who is playing heavy

A good heavy knows to hug walls and corners in order to minimize his hitbox. If he is running in the open in a straight line

* Soldier

Soldiers strive to maximize their mobility in all situations. Obviously, or one who is unable to RJ. In the latter case, you know his exact capabilities, and should be able to position yourself for a win. 

* Demo

Watch for his primary. Most demos will have the stickies out to do maximum spam damage when they are healthy and attacking. A demo showing pills is usually either feeling defensive

* Pyro

When critically low on health, as the pyro is either an expendable uber blocker, or near enough to the combo/nest to get heals. Still, in these comp situations, a defensive pyro will suicide before they retreat. 

* Scout

This one is tricky for me. Because they dodge so well, unless they see an overwhelming force approaching.

* Spy

Skilled spies will resort to trickstabs when caught out or injured. Watch for stair and cornerstabs. If the spy has a good chunk of HP left they will usually resort to the revolver; when dangerously low

* Medic

A good medic will always behave as if he is injured. He will hide behind his pocket, and switching main heal targets. If he abandons his heavy for a demo farther back, its probably because the heavy is taking more DPS than his HPS can account for-get ready to jump.     

* Sniper

Not much to say about this one. I'm not often close enough to lit snipers to see how they handle it. I would assume a sniper going for no-scopes would be a panicked sniper. 

* Engineer 

Another relatively simple one. 
L3 Engineers come in two flavors: Full health, and will be +w'ing back to the cabinet. 

A gunslinger engi will turn tail


* Those are my observations on movement under fire. Did I miss anything? Am I totally off base? Is my formatting so bad that its unreadable? Was everything here totally obvious and not need to be said aloud?

A lot of things are undead. Zombies are undead, that one twinkie I had on Halloween when I was in middle school was undead. Now, back from the halls of Valhalla with a newly sharpened thirst for blood that needs immediate quenching (and is also undead) is, my friends, the Highlander Revival Tournament


**Team Registration**

Registration for this event will open IMMEDIATELY and will close on Thursday


**Tournament Format**

The tournament will have a double-elimination format

Teams need a minimum of 7 players to participate in a match and may not have more than 9 players on the field at any one time.


**Gameplay Format**

As the name suggests

The banlist is as follows:
Sandman, Righteous Bison, Phlogistinator, Manmelter, Splended Screen, Ullapool Caber, Holiday Punch, Wrangler, Reserve Shooter

Matches will be played to 30 minutes and the team with the most captures at the end of the match or the team with a cumulative win-difference of 5 will be declared the winner or the team that captures faster in the case of maps such as goldrush


**Division Structure and Prize Information**

This tournament will consist of one National division. If there is enough interest in the tournament we will expand into an Advanced division for higher-skilled teams.

Teams are competing for glory, all the bragging rights you can handle.

It's too clunky and too prone to breaking your HUD. Plus

NOTE: I'm going to assume that a spectator's mode gets released with a matchmaking system.

**Access**
The public needs to have super easy access to any game they want. Right now it's really difficult for an average person to get a demo they can use. Most the time they don't know the teams

*Allow servers to host a plugin allowing them to send match data to a Valve hosted Video Repository

*Start tracking the tournament_mode games people are playing on

*Allow this repository of video logs to be searchable. Looking for players, weapons used, everything.

**Transparency**
Probably the biggest barrier to TF2 as a spectator sport is that positioning the camera is a very difficult task, you can't even see everyone's health

*Create a simple spectator hud for everyone to use. We already kinda know what we want here. We want somewhere to show the status of everyone at once. Right now

*Create in game transparency. [Blue's spectator plugin](http://teamfortress.tv/forum/thread/7848-advspec) should become an in game standard to help see players that are far away from the camera

*Have interactive features, and send you right to their perspective.

What it comes down to is this.  As long as Chess Club beat Vector Gaming (1-12) next week
 
 FT have 3 matches remaining against Xensity, they make LAN.  In order for Xensity to make LAN this season, They must beat FT tonight and hope CC can beat FT tonight as well.  Then Mix^ has to beat FT next week on Granary.  This puts FT at 8-8.  If Xen can beat Vector (1-12) they would also be 8-8 in this scenario with Xensity with the tiebreaker being most Rounds Won. Currently Xensity has 32 RF and FT has 35 RF.
 
TL:DR: There are a few more scenarios that can complicate things but it comes down to this: If Fully Torqued  win 1 match tonight

1360756082.0,18fv6z,MVM Expert: The Formula and General thoughts,lurkeroutthere,45,13,33,"Alright I apologize if this is the wrong reddit for this. Normally this subreddit seems pretty hardcore strategy and I realize MVM is kind of it's own special child. But for variosu reasons (mostly the odd hours i'm active due to my night shift schedule) I find myself playing a lot of MVM. 

Here are my observations at 36 tours in on MVM expert (plus mischelanious putzing around on maps I don't need).

Beating MVM Expert is all about sustained damage without dying. Clases that deal large amounts of damage continuosly like heavies are prefered where as classes that deal situational damage such as pyro or soldier are somewhat less then ideal. Classes that don't deal damage such as medic and spies in my opinion should not be played. As such i believe the basic MVM formula is as follows along with what they bring to the team. Engie (Line Reinforcement/Holding), 2xHeavies(Raw Damage over time). The sixth person can be a wild card. Now you can of course deviate from this formula but the more you deviate from it the harder life is going to be. The more your deviate the better your invidiual team members need to be and the better you need to be at working together as a team. Below I'll go into the classes you should be picking for your wild card, generally in my order of prefrence.

The desired:
Heavy - As I've already said the heavy is the backbone of the MVM force. More of a good thing in this case can often become a great thing. So much so if I have a team of 6 guys i know and work well together and we just want to blast through a map to help someone finish out a tour we'll generally go three heavies. It's like easy mode for MVM most of the time.

Soldier - Soldiers with buff banner are great for serving minicrits up to the team. The bane of soldiers is the fact that most MVM maps have lots and lots of pyros (coaltown is if i recall correctly the only exception) and usually deflector heavies too. Robo pyros are really really good at reflecting rockets back into the faces of your team mates. That's why people hate on soldiers a lot.

Second Demo - Two demos can work out especially if they communicate well. Downside is demos need to do a fair amount of preping the battlefield and don't really do anything for their team mates.

The sub-optimal:

Sniper - Sniper gets a lot of hate because a lot of the people who think they can play sniper just arn't very good, fully upgrade Jarate and max out your resistances also increase your melee attack speed. Piss on everything you can whore up every opportunity to minicrit from your team mates you can.

Pyro - There are a lot of people who really seem to like pyro in MVM. They get really really focused on the fact that a pyro can reset the bomb and get the team out of a tight spot. What they overlook entirely is if you are following the formula by and large you don't need to reset the bomb because everything is dead. In addition pyros when they do reset the bomb cause the robots to path funny

The Non Starters/Vote Kickers: 
Medic - Poor poor medics

Second Scout - Scout would be a unpalayable class for MVM if it wern't for their ability to get health from money and the need to have someone taht can range the field and pick up money. The mad milk slow and the fan of war mark take them from a necissary evil into a territory where they can be a real asset to a team. Plus giant robots hate getting marked and then milked more then they hate bieng damaged. A good scout with good resistances can use this to their advantage to draw fire and protect their team mates while keeping their own health filled up. All of this means that a scout can be an asset to the team without firing a single shot. Now having said that while one scout is essential two is bad. They just don't have the staying power without money to refill/overheal them and if there are two of them there is less money to go around.

Spy - I have never had a successful run with a spy that I can recall. They are all the situational problems of scouts and engies without any of the real team buffs.

Second Engie - Two engies = 2 x sentry busters the hassle involved with completely negates any positives from the class.

So thanks for reading my guide if it's useful i'll put some other MVM related stuff up.

TLDR: MVM Expert is all about damage 2 Heavies, 1 demo,1 wildcard is the path to success. Some classes are better then others.

1. TALK to your team. Find out how they want to play and always consider that before making any choices.


2. Get to mids with 300. ALWAYS. 

A. Whip to middle. Players that should be whipped: Heavy, but be sure that you wait for 300 hp from your medic before engaging on middle.

B. Don't escape plan to middle


3. You are pacman. Eat those health kits like fucking power pills. Don't take kits from your own team


4. Watch the flank. You are not a committed pick class like sniper or spy. You are a DM powerhouse that happens to be very quick when needed. Medic picks are largely unimportant if your team has an advantage of 20% or more. Stay alive and frag power classes. The medics will follow.
* Do however take medic picks if they have advantage/both have uber. Even dying to force a useless uber is very worth it as your team can run away then re-engage with a large advantage.

5. Annoy. Get behind them

6. On maps with setup time

7. Use the beggars bazooka when you need a pick. Seriously that shit is crazy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7fM07a3MGY

**I've never heard of you before

I'll try to keep this introduction short. I used to (and still kind of) main Medic during my competitive days of TF2 (with an off-class of  Sniper.) I was also co-leader of the infamous, but recently I  picked up circuitry (it's pretty interesting stuff, but hard as fuck to learn in your spare time.) On top of this I've also started  reading a lot more, most currently selections from Vonnegut and Huxley. 

**Okay then

Because I most likely view the role of Medic much differently than you do. It's interesting to see how others approach certain aspects of gameplay, primarily because I found it easier to explain (I still view the approach similar to Highlander mechanics.) 

**WITHOUT FURTHER ADO...**

Do you appreciate Symphonies?

^^**1.)** Playing Medic is like conducting a Symphony.

^^**2.)** You may be conducting 4th graders in their first recital

* In either case

^^**3.)** Your heals represent how well you're conducting the rhythm/tempo. Your players' classes represent the types of instruments being played.

* The ***Demoman*** represents the Cello. A loud and merciless low-tone instrument

* The ***Pocket Soldier*** is like the Violin. This instrument has a sharp sound and hits the important high notes. It's also the instrument closest to the conductor

* The ***Roaming Soldier*** is like the Viola. This instrument can hit tones between that of a Violin and Cello. It's typically in front of the conductor

* The ***Scouts*** are the instruments that make your Orchestra unique. They represent your Woodwinds, because their involvement with Strings is a difficult task.

^^**4.)** A fully over-healed team is when your Orchestra is at its peak performance. However

^^**5.)** When parts of your Orchestra begin to lose rhythm

&gt;""The entirety of my Orchestra is slightly off-tempo, etc.) are playing the loudest, so they affect my audience the most. In this case, I will focus on straightening them out first while signaling my Strings to play softer. *Then* I will focus on my Strings.""

^^**6.)** The previous analogy might appear to lose its context a bit when you're dealing with physical distances between you and the classes that need healing. I'm here to tell you this is not true.

^^**7.)** If your Orchestra is not paying attention to your signaling, but they are.

**This Rusty Bodega guy is crazy...**

Might be

**tl;dr** - Healing priorities, I share with you another perspective that is different from the norm: my own. I believe that seeing things from a completely different viewpoint can help better understand the process at hand. I'm offering you 3rd person perspective in your 1st person world.

**Note: This is also open for discussion due to my assumptions that people won't fully understand the analogies as they first read along. That

3. It allows for more effective spam in the hands of a smart Soldier

.

Hello truetf2!  Today's topic is simply: Do we need a better spectator system?

Currently, and respawn time.  Personally, I feel like this could be revamped, along with the system for spectating entirely.

On the topic of spectator HUDs

* Medic's medigun
* Classes lining up/in order
* Better warnings for combat
* System to spectate behind specific players faster
* Which players are in combat actively
* When a player switches to an offclass(6's)

These are just some ideas on what could be done to spice up the in-game hud system, and sourceTV.  Don't get me wrong, sourceTV is an excellent system that helps a lot, but wouldn't it be great if we had a native form of STV?  Imagine the front page of TF2 showing a couple of invite-level scrims/matches that we could just join in on and spectate live, with a delay of course, and see the action straight through our own cameras?

That's it for now truetf2.  If anyone suggests anything radically different

With how buggy the replay system currently is

Without further ado:  
[Download PREC here
To adapt the PREC plugin for pub usage:

* Set prec_mode 3, we'll use 7 as an example. All this can be done from console.
* Bind prec_mark to a key you'll remember (I have it bound to both ] and 0 on the keypad). 
* Type prec_dir 'demos'. Now all demos recorded will save in /Steam/steamapps/accountname/team fortress 2/tf/demos

A quick rundown;

* Prec_mode 3 tells the plugin to record every game you play.
* Prec_delete_useless_demo 1 deletes every demo you record without a killstreak or a bookmark.
* Prec_min_streak 7 sets the minimum killstreak needed to save the demo to 7
* Bind prec_mark ""([Your key here](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/List_of_default_keys))""

The demo will contain the entire round (Or maybe the entire game, or you can choose to export it as an .avi file.

If you don't get any killstreaks in a life of 7, and give you a time in killstreaks.txt at which you marked. You can mark as many times as you like in a demo, for when you get multiple awesome moments or killstreaks. 

Advantage of this system:

* Killfeed can be enabled/disabled
* HUD can be enabled/disabled
* Minimal chance of corruption of file
* Greater editing capabilities
* Automatically saves good killstreaks
* Works on servers without replays enabled

Disadvantages:

* Can require some basic knowledge of console commands. [Recommended reading](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Demos)

**Predictions**

mix &gt; iT 5-2 by highwayunicorn

ESEA TV's weekly match should be a good one, and have been playing with Hero on roamer and blaze on scout in an effort to shake things up. There is even some talk that Mad Chad could end up pocketing with Tyrone on roamer, though that seems a distant possibility at the moment. The role swap should be good for the team, as both players have struggled out of the gate. Ruwin and his pocket always get such good ubers that I think it will take a great performance out of Alfa and Tyrone to turn this into a DT win, and so far, they do not seem capable of that.

I've been hosting North American 6v6 Newbie Mixes for the past couple weeks

The purpose of the newbie mix is to introduce new players to the 6v6 competitive format.  This is a gamemode in TF2 which is the standard competitive format.  

If you wish to play

We ask that you know your rollouts (medics, we're all pretty nice) and let us know, we're more than happy to teach people how to rollout.  

If you have any questions I'll try to be on this thread as much as possible and answer anything you might ask.  I'll update this post as people ask questions.

And good luck finding anything but basic payload or A/D. While I understand these levels tend to be easier for new players there should be other maps in rotation as well.

What I would like to see is valve change up there static 24/7 servers and maybe sprinkle in some underplayed maps like steel and sawmill between the badwaters and goldrushes.

&gt;The Short Version: 
&gt;Please wait a few more days
&gt;
&gt;The Long Version:
&gt;UGC League has been facing a hosting company downtime lasting 7 days. Our hosting company, every co-hosted server they manage is being moved to a new datacenter. The reasons for this can only be imagined, but it is perhaps the worst situation I have ever seen related to web hosting. 
&gt;
&gt;We have found a new web host, we can return to full operation with as little consequence to players as possible. We will wait a few more days to see if that can be managed, because it is worth waiting for.
&gt;
&gt;But in the end the recovery of current data may not be possible, all the new teams who joined will have to be inserted, we can do that manually, though we wil have to reset those leaders passwords and they will have to rebuild their team rosters. 
&gt;
&gt;So two possible outcomes by this weekend:
&gt;1.	We return to operation with current data
&gt;2.	OR we return to operations with 3 week old data.
&gt;We should know by this weekend.
&gt;

&gt;Here's how you can create a video using max graphics settings with constant framerates even if your hardware sucks:

&gt;If you haven't already done so

&gt; * Load up TF2 using the settings that you want to show in the video. This includes screen resolution. If you are planning to upload to a low-quality Streaming site
&gt; * Open up the console and enter the following commands: ""sv_cheats 1"" and ""host_framerate 30"" (You can record at a higher framerate if you want a 60 FPS video for editing purposes
&gt; * Start playing the demo either via the console command ""playdemo [demoname]"" or the demo ui accessed via the command demoui or keyboard shortcut shift+f2
&gt; * When you get to the part of the demo that you want to record
&gt; * You should get a pop-up window with a list of codecs to choose from. I recommend using the XviD codecs. If the list doesn't include the codecs you need
&gt; * After you've begun recording the movie, this could take awhile, so you might want to find something else to do while the video renders.
&gt; * Type ""endmovie"" in the console when you are done recording.
&gt; * The resulting AVI file will not be located in your TF folder. It will be put in your ""team fortress 2"" folder with the name you required
&gt; * Now you can import the AVI into Windows Movie Maker or whatever program you use if you need to do any further editing.

The file might end up being a bit large

About a week or two ago, much better at jumps.  I can hardly pogo or sync or skip (yet), but from what I've seen, those methods are rarely useful in game (except for crazy gunboats rollouts).  I can jump reasonably accurately, at distance and land where I want to.

So, how do I decide when to make the jump?  How do I know if I should make the jump then or wait for a better position?  What should I be considering when I decide to make a bombing run on their medic?  I've been mostly waiting until the medic is distracted, so I can hopefully land my first rocket for 80+ damage, but I find that most of the time, their team is able to position themselves in between me and the medic, so that I can get 100+ damage on the medic, but not finish the fucker off.   

Any tips on timing and positioning on bombing the medic would be great!

Progress is slow

**What's changed:**

* Mac users will (hopefully) now see their native file chooser.
* Rendering is faster
* Loading is faster
* Support has improved marginally for certain HUD elements (for example
* **Many** internal changes (that don't affect you guys :/)

**Known issues:**

* Ctrl+A does not work.
* Things get weird when elements are parented and you select both.
* Things get hairy with many elements on the screen - I recently switched over to using the layer of the element to determine selection priorities - the ones on top are picked first (was previously based on size and distance). However
* I have code for the native windows file chooser
* The properties panel does not update when moving elements on the screen.

**TODO:**

* Font support
* Colour support
* Resolution changing
* Saving
* diff
* undo/redo

1368487443.0,1ea0m8,2 cfgs I made to help with spectating STV demos,djnap,34,1,18,"I've been looking into casting

As a result I wrote 2 cfg files

Step 1, but seeing as casters will be most likely using /u/sblue's plugin, this should be the case anyway.

What does this plugin do? It essentially replicates pressing 1, that can be used to spectate exact players easily, without needing their name.

Step 2

[6s](http://pastebin.com/vnxBccAX)

This file, and 3rd person free roam buttons. If the player switching buttons are active, Q and A switch to blu and red medic, W and S Demo, E 2 blu soldiers, D 2 red soldiers, R 2 blu scouts, press it a second time to get the other player. (I personally found it easier while casting, make it more difficult when people are off-classing.)

[HL](http://pastebin.com/kLyGgtbR)

This file, 1-9 (scout 1, medic 7, sniper 8, spy 9....). Pressing those 1-9 on the numPad will switch to the blu team class. Holding shift and pressing 1-9 on the numPad will switch to the red team class. Simple, yet effective.

Step 3

After loading either your STV demo or connecting to the STV server, and the very top is 5 (for 6s) or 8 (for HL).

**HOW TO INSTALL MINMODE**

To do this, the only extra step is making sure that the files you copy over are the ones in the ""minmode"" folder and not the root directory. 

Remember that if you're a 4x3 user to copy those files in the ""4_by_3_ratio"" folder and paste them into your tf/resource/ui folder!

It may be easier to do both of these things via the installer below.

- Wow.  As a spy that does more stabbing than shooting
- L'Etranger + C&amp;amp;D = if IW and C&amp;amp;D had a baby.
- L'Etranger itself isn't that bad.  I can point-blank kill razorback snipers with 3 shots.
- L'Etranger will be my primary weapon (even though I started the thread inquiring about the Enforcer.  Again
- I haven't really noticed the added cloak on-hit
- L'Etranger + IW + Knife is my primary loadout
- L'Etranger + IW + Spycicle is situational
- L'Etranger + DR + Knife is my primary pub loadout

**Short Circuit:**

- The faster function time and lower metal cost (if you connect) make this *much* better.
- Your Demo hates me.
- Short Circuit + Gunslinger = Cart Pushing Machine.
- In a competitive pub
- This is a great Kritz-Demo neutralizer.  The key is to keep 200 metal and focus hard on not wasting your zaps.  If I concentrate I can zap most of his 8 kritz sticky bombs.  I haven't lived through one of these
- Kritz Soldiers are much easier to handle.  The rockets are easy to time.
- I have held the last point on Gold Rush Stage 2 with a mini and a L3 dispenser.  There is generally plenty of time to zap rockets and stickies.  
- I'm more vulnerable to snipers as I expose myself to zap.
- Great for escaping from Soldiers who catch me without help (think 5cp traveling to a pt) who would normally juggle me then kill me.  When they see the Short Circuit
- I'm sold on it.

**Dead Ringer:**

- I haven't noticed *that* much of a loss due to the nerf.
- I cannot survive a pyro focus flaming on me.  But before
- I cannot body block a doorway when a heavy + medic combo pushing in.
- I cannot survive stickies + rocket while cloaked.  
- But those are rare.
- I'm OK with the nerf.

**Mini Sentry**

- The wrangled inaccuracy isn't bad.  I can still take down a heavy.
- I think it's fair that people can destroy it while it's building.  It doesn't happen often
- I'm OK with it.


I haven't tried all of the new weapons.  What are you thoughts?


EDIT

**Quick Fix**

- How could I forget this!!  It's AMAZING.  GREAT for getting to mid-fights.  Tag along with a Scout and try to win mid.  
- If you win mid
- Uber in to last and spread the love and still be able to cap!!
- You can't survive against a normal uber,False,,t5_2stfn,1374033554.0,,flair-spy,t3_1iflg5

first of all excuse me just in case a similar thread already exists.

So, forced Motds, and so on. Also I hate joining a team consisting of 50% Spies and/or Snipers and there's NEVER a Medic. I really enjoy playing Medic and I do it a lot but I also need some variety

I feel like I need something more advanced than these servers but I don't think I'm skilled/experienced enough for playing lobbies or pugs. 

I already have a few servers in my favorites list but they are always empty or full. 

Do you have any suggestions? Is there a website showing servers for advanced players

I fear I'm slowly getting sick of the game if things go on like this. :(

**Predictions**

Ginyu Force &gt; Quality Control 5-2 Courtesy of Pudding Cup

Given the map is croissant I wouldn’t be surprised to see a long excruciating match with many failed pushes especially into last, and even TMP on pyro that will be a major deciding factor in how well they perform. If these people can make magic happen on the flank I can see QC getting a round or two or at least help staving off their own demise. The amount of experience QC has from pugging 24/7 could also give them an edge on this map. Either way it should provide for some heated back and forth. Watch out for Max to get his dome on and Dill to get his hiding heavy on. This match will also be pitting famed pyro mains Huey Lewis and TMP against each other for the title of “Best at a Class No One Cares About”.

I am keeping this HUD alive even after Chippy's release of the rebuilt KNHUD.

**Thanks:**
Thanks go to Chippy for letting me use his old KNHUD as a base for this HUD. Thanks also go to Quartz for volunteering all of that time to make the HUD what it is now.

http://live.ugcleague.com/

What's UGC Live? It's a community casting portal designed to aggregate and popularize match casting of UGC games. We believe TF2 spectating has great and largely unrealized potential

Each week we'll be requesting SourceTV demos on our forums for community casters to cast. For everyone on the approved community casters list, the site will automatically change when you go live to show your casting at the top of the page.*

What can you

* Submit STV demos! We'll have a spot on the UGC forums for you to upload your team's match demos for others to pick up and cast.
* Cast! We're hoping that UGC Live will spur folks who want to cast and never have into doing so for the first time. We'll be putting out a public call for casters who want to partner with UGC Live.
* Comment! UGC Live is now.. um.. live.. in beta form. We're hoping the site will change and adjust as we receive community feedback. That's why I'm posting this here. We want to promote an intelligent, delayed by the host change, and we'd both love to get your input.

Thanks guys.

-Aubron

*This doesn't mean you can't cast non-UGC content. Both youtube and twitch will be checked for ""UGC"" in the title before hitting the site.

EDIT: Just to give you an idea of what the site looks like in ""Live Mode"", but this should give you a good idea. http://i.imgur.com/VAM5M.jpg

UPDATE: We now are in the process of ditching the forums in favor of some new forms to organize data submission.

1315104914.0,k41my,Things EVERY Player Should Do,DracoX872,32,2,15,"So I'm sure you want you're team to ~~lose~~ win right?
&gt;~~*Pshhh* disregard objective; acquire headshots~~ BAD SNIPER MENTALITY. *BAD*

Well here's a list of things anyone should do to help your team out, some are overlooked things. Like half are engie tips.


---------------------------------------------------------------
**Early Game**

* Instead of teabagging your teammates, and THEN continue ~~teabagging~~ playing
* Do NOT set up your sentry at your spawn unless you're sure another engie will be getting their teleporter up.
* For offense, and a stronger push.
* Offensive engies should focus on getting a teleporter up. Its the best way an offensive engie can help his or her team. Sentries and dispensers have equal priority. If your team is pushing

---------------------------------------------------------------
**Mid Game**

* If your engies are having trouble, scouts, soldiers, and heavies all have some ability to help an engie defend. 
* Stop molesting your dispenser and help a fellow engie out! Splash damage can quickly ruin a nest
* Help defend the medic at **all costs**. Take out spies
* Pyro's should airblast enemies away from medics and extinguish them. Friendly explosions around medics can force enemies to stay at certain distances from them.
* Other classes should do anything to keep the medic safe. If a heavy med combo is pushing, or Airblast, or throw jarate, mad milk or light however they're attacking on fire. Mad Milking an enemy can help reduce pressure on medics.
* Take out your quick-fix if you have one and quickly heal teammates coming back for health. Sometimes, and continue to push. 
* Killing enemy medics can help change the tide of the game. Do what you can to take them out without taking too much damage.
* Don't play as a spy unless absolutely necessary. Don't do it. If you're a very good spy player
* Rocket/Grenade spam is FTW. It can hold back enemies and may even land you a kill. Don't overdo it or enemies will obliterate you while you reload.
* Mid-game focuses a lot on taking out sentries and breaking up pushes. Do everything you can to make the game end quicker. You won't have much of a chance later on.
* Make sure you focus on the objective
* Know when to retreat and when to push. Retreating will keep your team alive and making a coordinated push can be a game changer. Same applies to ubers. If an enemy is about to cap
* Dispensers are key to maintaining a living

----------------------------------------------------------------------
**Near End Game**

* Do whatever you can to accomplish the objective. If there's about a minute left
* If your team is absolutely screwed
* When on the verge of winning
* At the point where your entire team is spawn killing and you're on defense
* Engies should not move their sentries all the way up on defense. When your team pushes forward

------------------------------------------------------------------------
**End Game**

* Teabag the noobs. 
* Honor the fallen.

How true is this at higher levels? I am always told not to strafe and scope because I will never learn to hit a moving target and I am getting better but I feel like every higher level sniper uses some combination of false scoping or deceptive strafing in order to take the second shot and hit first.

**Predictions**

check &lt; mix 3-5 by dearjohncarter

This might be the hardest match of the week to predict. Mixup will be rolling out a brand spankin' new lineup: Ruwin on scout, and he will have two of the best aggro scouts in TF2 history backing up his calls. A team that was already pushing out more pressure than most teams is now going to effectively double it. Chess Club do have the pieces in place to counter it, including a solid pocket who can defend his medic pretty well from the hordes in tri, and a demoman who can push enough damage through chokes to keep Mixup back in alfa. It still should go Mixup's way, but with the shakiness of the roster switch and the good play of CC lately, expect it to be a good one.

Pros:

1. **Allows the scout to roam.** The scout has greater survivability as a roaming class and can do greater burst damage than a pyro. He can suicide for key picks and get back to the front lines quicker than the pyro.

2. **Keeps the pyro with the combo.** With a few exceptions

Cons:

1. **Distracts the pyro.** When a pyro is building

2. **Forces the pyro to use the detonator.** Generally the flare gun is considered to be better due the full crits rather than the mini-crits.

1) Introduction

2) Analyzing a Weapon

3) Examples of Analysis

4) Requests

5) Other crap I've written
*****
##Introduction

Welcome back children.  We all know me, people like THIEF that use very unusual weapons like the FAN and Scottish Resistance can exist in this universe, but I can honestly say time spent learning weaponry should best be kept to using what we know work best for each class already.
*****
##Analyzing A Weapon

Compared to stock

**+**General Usability and **-**Situational Usability

OR

**-**General Usability and **+**Situational Usability

Following the above 2-option chart, giving up your general usability for situational features(usually gimmicks), can lead to a lower presence in many situations.  Do note, most weapons that follow the second pattern offer a specific niche, and allow you to try and overcome the General Usability disadvantage that it offers, but more often than not it is incredibly difficult to balance out the **-** it offers.  
*****
##Examples of Analysis

Time to pick some random weapons, here are the first 3 weapons randomized in:

##Force-A-Nature

**-**General combat effectiveness

Removing the general combat effectiveness of a scout by reducing his clip size so drastically really shows, I stand sternly in saying that a scout of equal skill using the scattergun will almost always come out on top over a FaN scout, and will generally be more useful for a competitive game.

##Direct Hit

**-**General combat power

Hitting the soldier right in the explosions hurts.  Having such a ridiculous explosion reduction makes a soldier's rockets a liability in many scenarios, this downside can be mostly overcome with a large amount of practice, but in the end, it is hard to justify losing such a massive amount of combat presence for the situational offerings it brings to the table.

##Neon Annihilator

This one brings a better challenge to analysis

Combat Pyro:

**-**General Combat strength

Engie Buddy Pyro:

**+**General engie defense

Here we have a stark contrast based on playstyle.  When in the thick of combat as a pyro, until the pyro gets a sniper rifle melee option.  When defending an engineer's nest, the Neon Annihilator brings the beautiful ability to defend that nest much harder, even if your engie dies and his buildings are sapped.  Also, when defending a nest, you are not as required to deal massive heaps of damage, so much as provide airblasts for ubers, and spam

##Requests

The rockets shoot out one after another in rapid succession

When I used to it I was often charging up several rockets before I saw even the hint of enemies. It's better to be safe than sorry when using this weapon. However you'll always want to fire when you reach 3 rockets or else you will die from the back fire which does around 190 damage.

Ammo consumption is pretty big if you are shooting 3 rockets in order to stop yourself from exploding so always keep picking up ammo from dead enemies and such.

Still, what are other classes doing? I can't imagine a demo operating as effectively without consistent healing and support. What is the engineer doing? Are teleporters reserved for the less mobile classes? Should they use mini-sentries to apply pressure on the front lines or try to use standard sentries to ""hold down the fort"" so to speak. Are the classes that besides the combo that normally stick together? Also the issue of pushes come to mind. Anyway, I'm mostly asking if there's anything in high-level HL that is completely alien to 6v6, a rundown of how each classes roles change, and how coordination changes.",,,flair-medic,

* You must defend from the teams below you

* You are allowed 1 change in your team roster
* A new team can register at anytime.

The upsides are nice, and why not add another? The charge shot I don't normally use, but I find it being able to take down a building that a demo can't take down by simply disabling it, and letting your team take care of it.

You will need to join the [Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/6v6newmix) so that you know when mixes will happpen.

**Who can play**

This is primarily open for people who are new to competitive TF2

It doesn't matter if you do not know how the roll-out goes

**What do you need to know/need**

* Preferably the roll-out (necessary for the demo)
* An idea of what to do as your class
* The basic holds on each map
* A mic and mumble downloaded

**The rules**

* Need a microphone
* Connect to the correct mumble channel
* Need to be a conversationally fluent English speaker
* Mumble name MUST match your in-game steam name (prevent confusion)
* ETF2L season 13 config
* Matches last maximum 30 minutes
* Team classes limited to the following: Medic (1), Scout (2)

**How it works**

An admin will post up an event on the group for when a mix is going to start (15 mins notice at the least) and what slots are available for people to play. People should use comments to determine which class they wish to play. if you comment early you are likely to get a spot as your desired class however if you are late arriving for the mix your place may get taken. We apologise in advance for this. Just turn up 5 minutes beforehand! the teams will be sorted and game information handed out and you're good to go!

1336000497.0,t44os,Thoughts about Bazaar Bargain and other Sniper unlocks,Xovaan,35,10,26,"I feel that the Bazaar Bargain isn't very good.

http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/File:Bazaar_Bargin_Time_Chart.png

Back when I was playing over the summer, as in, rarely missing. When you figure 50% of an average sniper's shots hit and probably 30% of those are headshots, it gets worse. With simple math, average players have a 15% chance to bring it to stock level of charge and just barely 2% of a chance to have any perceivable benefit from this rifle. This is all just rough math, but you get the idea.

The Bargain is a very clear downgrade to any other rifle. We all know that. I understand that Valve was attempting to create a rifle that rewarded good playing with something that wouldn't replace the stock sniper rifle, and stock rifle) that reward charged bodyshots with really no downsides, I feel something needs to be addressed that reflects the sniper's linear skill progression and also rewards good playing and still not be a complete upgrade or downgrade to the stock sniper rifle.



So my solution? Make a rifle that rewards skill and isn't completely terrible for your average sniper.

The Bazaar Bargain had a great start with this: headshots, but it unfortunately was clear statistical downgrade over any other unlock the sniper has (with the exception of the Huntsman, being that the Bargain still is hitscan and does 150 damage on a headshot, etc). 


I'd really like to see a weapon that hasn't been done before: everything has a positive charge bar. Why not make something that starts fully charged and drains to zero?

--Starts fully charged for 165 damage headshots but slowly goes to 0% for a small base damage.
--Does very low damage/no damage on body shots while scoped and cannot shoot unzoomed
--Zooms / cycles shots faster

The play style would reward snipers who like faster

My theory:

1. You still kill light classes in one shot
2. It rewards skill in the same way the stock sniper rifle does: linearly
3. You trade off the ability to deal large damage with a power shot for the ability to deal more frequent smaller amounts of damage
4. We already have three sniper rifles that reward body shots (stock / machina / sleeper) and a bow that

**How to use:** When the Medi Gun is selected, MOUSE2 not only pops uber, but automatically switches to your Medi Gun if you happen to have a different weapon out. Great for tight situations.

**Why should I use this over the built-in autoheal advanced option?**
Because it's crawling with bugs. This gives you a reliable result every time and you don't have to click as much.

**---IMPORTANT NOTE:---** This script does not work well with the ""last weapon"" key

**---ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE:---** The reason for the ""exec clear"" on the top is to reset all your binds when you switch classes so you don't run into problems. What you need to do is make a file named ""clear.cfg"" (in notepad or any other text editor) and stick it with all your other configs. This is important if you want to have class specific configs like this

    bind MOUSE1 +attack
    bind MOUSE2 +attack2
    bind 1 slot1
    bind 2 slot2
    bind 3 slot3

mix &lt; bp 1-2 by dearjohncarter

Oh deary lord oh me oh my I can feel myself gettin' the vapors and ooh my chest is all tight and such. bp have been unquestionably the best team so far and Mixup are duking it out with Torqued for second place. Mixup should have Ruwin back, the team never seemed to have too much cohesion on Gravelpit and it boiled down to ""can clockwork and b4nny do everything for us?"" I think shrugger becomes the key difference maker and steamrolls through B point several times en route to a bp victory in the ESEA Match of the Week.

Is this a viable attack strategy if the med is heavily covered? The pyro is less likely to airblast me away from the med because he doesn't realize I have the power to backstab.

Short introduction today. I'm a little late with this challenge.  
Anyways
  
Ladies and Gentlemen. I present to you the:  
  
##RIGHTEOUS BISON  
(somewhat clever joke about the weapon)  
Lets dive in and see what this little baby can do!  
  
* Does not require ammo  
* Projectiles penetrate enemy targets
* Projectiles can not be reflected  
* Deals only 20% damage against buildings  
  
This weapon is a pretty handy secondary weapon for spamming. At longer ranges or tight corridors, you'll pretty much always have ammo in your primary. Remember tho, it doesn't penetrate buildings! As and extra, you can also light Huntsman arrows on fire.  
  
**Rules**  
  
* You have to play Soldier for at least 1 hour  
* You can't change class in the middle of the challenge  
* You have to use this weapon  
* You have to play REAL Soldier!

Now
  
Being one of the two classes in game that can instantly kill any non-invulnerable target (or have massive damage reduced) makes the Spy a feared enemy. Unlike the Sniper however, you can sneak past the enemy line and pretend to be one of them. You also have two kinds of Sappers that can disable and hurt a building in their own different ways. Together with all that, you have a big selection of revolvers, all very different and have their uses.  
Today
  
Ladies and douchebags
  
##DIAMONDBACK  
To be honest
It doesn't shoot diamonds either
  
* Grants a guaranteed Critical Hit when destroying a building with your Sapper. You can store up to 35 Crits and you don't need to get the credit for destroying the building
* -15% Damage  
* No random Critical Hits  
   
So basically, this gun doesn't need to wait for cool-down and doesn't have reduced fire-rate, so you can really lay down huge damage quickly with this when you have a couple of crits stored. But, well, unlike the Ambassador, you need to destroy buildings to get those crits while Ambassador only needs to do a headshot. So, while in theory you can quickly do more damage in bursts than the Ambassador
Now, tell me what the maximum amount of crits you where able to store.

**Rules**  
  
* You have to play Spy for at least 1 hour  
* You can't change class in the middle of the challenge  
* You have to use this weapon  
* I'm not restricting you guys this time in what other weapons you are allowed to use. I would recommend using the normal Sapper
  
I want you to make Engineers regret every building their buildings when you are around. Now get going Ladies and Gentlemen. Buildings don't sap them self.

**Predictions**
 
Ginyu Force &gt; Baby Punching Marathon 2-1
 
The time has finally has come for my most anticipated match of the season: Ginyu vs BPM. Last season two of the best and closest games were fought between two teams, but after a long deliberation I’m going with Ginyu Force to clench the victory here, which will also more than likely set them up for an undefeated regular season. It’s going to be far from easy though as BPM, after 4 episodes, has finally powered up to their final and most potent form. Pulse is back from outer space and he’s ready to stomp on nerds, as is Kapoww who finally gives BPM the solid and consistent starting demo that they needed. Boink and Bronze, of course, and if this week were a different map (a 5cp or KOTH) I might have gone with BPM to win. I’m afraid though that BPM’s aggression will land them into trouble more often than not as they’ll feed picks and advantages to the patient and calculated beast that is Ginyu Force. Sitting at the heart of that beast on pl_barnblitz will be Cusideabelicoln, and once they do they’ll Huey Lewis immediately standing in their way pushing them like a 9 lb newborn. BPM offensive capabilities are nothing to underestimate however

1355437770.0,14t5c3,HL2/Source networking cvars explained and detailed,GreenPlasticJim,31,4,11,"**Source multiplayer networking basics**

Clients communicate with the server by sending and receiving 20-30(default) data packets per second.  Every TF2 server takes snapshots of the game world and entity states 66 times per second.  When a player executes and action, the player's updated location/position/action will be sent to all clients according to each clients specific update rate.  This basic networking system creates discrepancies between player action and hit registry/visual feedback. 
 
Lag compensation

**Client-side networking cvars**

Ok, you could really screw up your connection. 

*  **rate** {bytes per second

*  **cl_updaterate** {snapshots per second
  
*  **cl_cmdrate** {packets per second

*  **cl_interp** {number in seconds, this basically means that your computer is rendering video 100 ms behind the current time.  By doing this your computer can average or interpolate events between two packets.  If you were always rendering at the current time, your computer wouldn't have both a past and a future snapshot to interpolate between.  For watching STV, where you receive fewer packets and the current time is irrelevant you can set this value high (cl_interp 1 is good).  However with the introduction of the next cvar, cl_interp_ratio, you can simply set cl_interp to it's optimal value of 0 safely.

*  **cl_interp_ratio** {default is 2} - This value is used to calculate your interp or lerp value by dividing it by your cl_updaterate value (only if this interp value is greater than your cl_interp value

*  **cl_lagcompensation** {boolean 1 or 0
*  **cl_predict** {boolean
* **cl_smooth** {Boolean} - When you computer uses prediction to render your actions sometimes they conflict with the servers information.  The discrepancy between this conflict is resolved by smoothing between the client and servers information.  This cvar turns this smoothing on or off. 
* **cl_smoothtime** {seconds} - This is the amount of time the smoothing will take to smooth over and solve a prediction error.
* **cl_pred_optimize** {numbered setting} - The only thing I could find on this was- ""If it is set to 2 or above


**Good/Bad connection configs from chris's maxfames**

Just to sort of put these cvars and their values in perspective here are the values the common video optimization cfg uses:

    //Good connection
    cl_cmdrate 66
    cl_interp 0
    cl_interp_ratio 1
    cl_lagcompensation 1
    cl_pred_optimize 2
    cl_smooth 0
    cl_smoothtime 0.01
    cl_updaterate 66
    rate 60000

    // Bad connection
    cl_cmdrate 40
    cl_interp 0
    cl_interp_ratio 2
    cl_lagcompensation 1
    cl_pred_optimize 2
    cl_smooth 0
    cl_smoothtime 0.01
    cl_updaterate 40
    rate 35000

Please feel free to correct me if I made any mistakes here.  This was mostly an attempt for me to understand this nonsense.

Context time!  Morello, said that medics destroyed the game competitively.

*Public games are what got me in love with tf2.* Seeing people that were much better than me (I was fucking terrible), trying to coordinate my team via voicechat. It was a great feeling winning a close round because of my well-timed uber.

The fun of winning, drunken black man wearing a pumpkin head and swinging a huge fuckin' battle ax, or barely controlled, fist-clenching rage at the Spy had just stabbed me for the 6th time, but learning with each hour played, I slowly improved.

As I improved, worse than me. I started playing different classes, and started looking for more skilled peers to play with. Hence began my interest in competitive TF2.

Fast forward to today, but also pick up games and scrims with my team. I find my pub mindset has changed, simply because of my experience (gametime played, skill level change, and exposure to competitive). 

In an organized setting, Kritz stickysnipe make it fun: these things are what initially got me into TF2 at the pub level. 

I dont find these things fun in pubs because its too easy; the enemy is too uncoordinated, I will undoubtedly be topscorer of my team, and one of two things will have happened.

* 1. Our team will absolutely be crushing the other. I will effortlessly have 5+ doms
* 2. Our team will be losing extremely badly

Pubs can be extremely frustrating for me

* 1. They are too easy/skill level is too disparate.
* 2. Class balance is fucked.
* 3. Teams are completely unbalanced.

Point being

**Pubs are a change of pace and a change of mindset from competitive.  I derive a different type of fun from them than I do from a scrim or PUG.** 

Pubs are still fun for me for several reasons.

* 1. It doesnt matter. Class choice
* 2. Can make my own little mini-games. *Hmmm... lets see if I can cause a stalemate if I build a level 3 here... Yep
* 3. Its undoubtedly a lot more random than competitive. *The crits, why, WHY would you chase me at 2HP when I had 3 teammates around, and kill me cuz you got a random crit* This randomness practically guarantees me scenarios I have never seen in every game.
* 4. Maps. *You just will never see dustbowl, they're broke, doesn't mean they're not fun.



*TL;DR* **Why do you play pubs? What makes them fun for you?**

(For the lazy people that don't want to read as much and like video introductions
 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDEH4LCzsA4 (BIG CREDIT TO PYTHON
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ2grcYMNpg 

This is a hold that should be executed very quickly or after a failpush from the opposing team where you push into the house with the second forward spawn for the attacking team (or the defending team's first spawn)
 
For the location calls
Catwalk, Sewers, Shack (rightish) http://puu.sh/3H0XQ.jpg
House http://puu.sh/3H11D.jpg
 
Full hold: http://puu.sh/3xLmT.png (ignore the sticks
 
The most important thing is to do it quickly; you sacrifice a midly-strong 2nd point hold for an incredibly strong 3rd point hold
Basically
 
http://puu.sh/3H11D.jpg
After backing out to the spawn, where they will be forced early, or they push the house right into the sentry sightline and main.
 
The only thing that hasn't happened until then is that your team still has uber and somehow needs to be forced. The Lv3 is also up and has a bunch of area denial. A spy should not be able to pick you off in the shack as there's one way to get you and that is to uncloak early (because the combo should hear a close spy discloak when they're like backs-to-backs with the spy) which makes the Engi able to call when he jumps up into the shack from the panel. Or you can just turn around sometimes.
So
 
http://puu.sh/3H0XQ.jpg
After the push comes in, which renders it pretty much a fail push.
 
But, Catwalk, Bridge, where should the enemy team push from?
A way for them to get anywhere is to push the whole flank route, because the push is pretty much expectable. It should take about 20 seconds to push the whole way to the sentry nest while getting heavily damaged by the Heavy from Catwalk, and the defending Pyro has a whole idea of what's going on and can just blast people off again.
 
But how do you defeat such a strong forward hold? I don't know. I've had one opportunity to try this with my Platinum team
 
Now
 
Pros:
- Renders enemy Spy pretty much useless as the only opportunity to pick people off is to go to the flank or pick the sniper and neither will be a good pick
- Only one sightline for the enemy Sniper to get picks and that is also just the flank classes and the defending Sniper (thing is
- Soldier pretty much useless
- requires the enemy team to have perfect distracting coordination and flank control (I don't think any hold on another map is harder to beat)

**Match Preview by Ally and Mystery Gamers**

My thoughts: Anddddd finally, the RLM roster has the raw ability to play a top level but currently it’s too soon into their lifetime as a team to pose any real threat.

 Mystery Gamer #1 (Prediction: 5-0 Granary 5-0 Process):

“Epsilon stomping pretty much every team in officials and having overall decent results in pcws makes them the clear favourite for this match. RLM are a fairly new team and still struggle to get some team chemistry going so I highly doubt that they will be a threat for epsilon.”

Couple of points:

 * # Total amount of kills or dmg is pretty meaningless because players have different playtimes or missing logs

 * # The spreadsheet is a work in progress and should be more aesthetically pleasing and user friendly in the future. What’s important now is that the data is all accurate as far as the original data goes.

I was actually contemplating whether if I should use this weapon or not. On one hand, a highly negative view upon it for the wrong reasons and because of this the mere mention of it have cause the biggest rage rants I've ever seen in a game. So I want people to at least try it before they form a opinion. On the other hand, I don't want to be spammed with rage messages, but I find that unlikely because you guys have shown to at least think before you type. I think some of you have a vague idea of what weapon I'm talking about.  
  
Ladies and Gentlemen
  
##BACKBURNER  
  
You know
Lets look at what this weapon does:  
  
* 100% Critical hits from behind. The angle where you get critical hits from is 90 degrees unlike the backstab that has 180 degree angle.  
* 150% Airblast cost. Meaning
  
OK, having a plus side that caters to a different playstyle at the cost of continued usage of one of the unique abilities the Pyro possess. So why did I choose this weapon? Because I believe many hate this weapon unfairly. Many say that this weapon caters to w+m1, which is kinda weird when you think about it. None of this weapons stats supports just running straight forward and flaming. Actually, the Stock and Degreaser supports this more since they have a reliable amount of airblast to get away to safety easier. With the BB, you basically get no benefit from charging straight on since the only time you get those criticals is when you flank your opponent, doing the opposite of a suicide w+m1.  
  
**RULES**  
  
* You have to play Pyro for at least 1 hour  
* You can't change class in the middle of the challenge  
* You have to use this weapon  
* You have to play REAL Pyro!  
  
So, so there's no harm in trying. Have fun people!

**General stuff:**

If you're ever running around not healing someone
should have at least a general idea of what path each player will take
on a push for each point
alone. Things like this are the difference between the enemy medic
saying ""What? They had uber already?"" and you dying at 97%. On a
related note
if you could be healing a teammate. In addition to the lost uber
and health
teammate to body block than to focus on aiming needles (unless you
get caught in a bad position where they're between you and your ally -
- which basically just sucks and leave you few options).

You should always be looking for opportunities to give crit heals
(and your team should be trying to play to get crit heals as much
as possible). Unless you're retreating and trying to keep people
alive
mid fights usually get resolved 5-10s after the combo arrives. Are
you going to spend that entire 10s healing the demo from 20hp at a
pathetic 24hp/s
that can run in and tear things up?

Don't jump unless you're going to ride an explosion or get up on
something. This locks you into a predictable path for both hitscan and
projectile weapons. If you were playing blindfolded
by mashing wasd than mashing wasd and space.

Stay focused and make decisions based on the moment you're in
what happened 2s ago. If a soldier jumps at you and you're at 97%
don't pop right when you hit 100 if you managed to get a surf and he
doesn't have a shot. Don't duck past splash around a corner if the guy
who was going to splash you died as you went there. If their combo
was close on the corner 5s ago
you know they're still there.

**Uber stuff:**

If you get shot for 50 damage and you don't know what hit you
pop uber. You got flanked by a scout or soldier and will die on the next
hit.

Milking your uber is good until you do it too much. It's way
better to pop 1s early 10 times than to let your pocket die once
because you think you can clutch it at 10hp. Rule of thumb: assume
that every fragging class nearby will be able to do 100 damage to
your target right away (because they can)
drop anyone. Also
than to pop on a 50hp soldier and have a 1s longer uber... if you get
juggled apart or need to flash it around and can't get that soldier back
to 200+ by the end of the charge
Basically
be blocking big spikes of damage.

When the other team ubers while you have uber
multiple players in the area
pocket+medic forward
situation you want to create is to have non-uber players far back
and your single soldier up in their face to force a split and chase
them down
aggressive pocket. If you let them push you back
force you to split and kite away from your uber
them

You can use an uber without using it (zen). If the other team
does not have their charge
their combo so they don't take a 70% death or something like that.
As a result
the threat of you popping keeps them away. The only reason to pop
around a corner is if you know you're going to take a damage spike
there and you need to get in to do damage fast
holding right there and you're going for an uber exchange.

Despite what frag videos may lead you to believe
to get the enemy medic to drop uber by using a kritz. What you should
be looking for when kritzing is to force a pop with your combos far
apart
ram a kritz into a combo that has uber
since the very visible yellow flecks in your beam are broadcasting your
intentions. Also
kritz: the main damage from a kritz comes in the first shot. If you pop
too late and miss that first shot
up for it with the 1s longer kritz you have (generally time you spend
waving your mouse around looking for enemies that have long since
scattered).

**Team stuff:**

If you hit mid without both soldiers at 300
Gully is the only example I can think of where you arrive with less
(because it's so short and you can't equalize). On every other map you
should always have 1 soldier equalize
cabinet (if there is one -- if not he waits for crit heals) then keep pace
with the medic. The ideal healing pattern is demo
first jump (if he has crit heals -- if he jumped to a cabinet
back to demo, crit
heal other soldier at mid. There's no reason not to spend 5 minutes
straightening this out with your soldiers
them have a free direct rocket every mid.

There are 2 things you can do to win in TF2. You can attack
or you can defend. If you're not doing either of these
This is especially true when you have some kind of disadvantage -
- less charge, etc. If you play super
aggressive on their med*
on the next spawn wave. If you give up ground to buy time for your
uber, you can even things out. If you push up
to standard positions you'd hold if it was 6v6 even uber
DM vs people with more health and numbers
and lose points/take longer to recover than you should. Don't do this.

*By the way
show your combo
If they never see your combo, we
can just back up and frag these guys then push in"". Just showing the
combo and throwing spam puts way more pressure on -- even if they
clairvoyently recognize that you're really trying to suicide
slam your combo into them if they try to run the med
them to take it.

You will lose the round if you sit on your last point. You should
always consider being on last as a ""well
be trying to get out of there
out with everyone and rely on covering doors to block backcaps. Sure
you'll get messed up by spies from time to time if you're too slow
capping 2
or combo locked on the last point and hoping you can deny endless
pushes is a more likely path to defeat than risking a backcap is.

**Part 2**

**Know your advantages**

* Check Scoreboard very often.
* To know when you have an advantage
* Man Advantage (Whoever has more players up)
* Uber Advantage (whoever has uber or not)
* When healing hurt players it takes about 40 seconds to charge a uber. When you have it and they
don't...push right into them. If they have it and you do not
 
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGXfcN7dfUU

    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL7Tzq168Bs&amp;feature=related

    I found these videos to be very helpful

  I even suggest showing them to your team

* Health Advantage - If a players tells your team that he did a lot of damage on the enemy (demoman most likely says this)
* Spawn Advantage - This means if a team doesn't get foward respawn after they cap middle for example
* Your heal order at the beginning of a round is VERY important. You and your team must work together to
be fully buffed and ready for the middle fight.
    Your heal order should be:
    At beginning of round
    Demo takes his jump to door
    Continue buffing him.
    While this is going on
    After the freeze time is over, which means just tapping him with the heal beam will benefit him a lot. It will make his first several jumps a lot more effective and easier on you so you wont have to heal him from low hp. Your pocket soldier SHOULD NOT JUMP in spawn. He should wait for your heal at the beginning before making a jump.
    While you are walking out of the door of spawn then you can grab your scouts as they are running. It's really helpful for a scout to get the buff
    Your pocket should be jumping with you the entire way to middle

    so

**At Middle:**

I do not like how you and your team fell behind your train on Badlands middle. If you do the rollout I
explained
you can position yourself either on the point
them healthy.

Being behind that train is just asking the enemy team to spam you out because that area is very small.
Spread more heals to everyone on the team. Your scouts should be coming by and getting buffs often.
Your pocket does not have to be at 300 at all times
your safety
stickies reloaded is deadly.

Medic is all about decision making. I was impressed by your instinct to go in for needles or ubersaws. And
how you avoided confrontation and got out of some situations. So great job and keep that up. When a
scout is on you and you have your pocket
a great decision
I really didn't get to see much of your pushes
that later.

On last
you. Just try to fall back in spawn and rotate around to the left side. Don't stand there and hope they will
forget about you.

__________________________
Thanks to Tomeron for giving me this tip.

This method is basically all about **[muscle memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory)**. You want to train your muscles and reactions to know exactly how much to move your arm/wrist to place the crosshair in a precise place

All you need for this is a simple exercise. To set it up

It isn't critical which position (blue circle) you stand in but it is probably easiest to use the one nearest the target. At this point you have probably noticed the annoying sound of the resupply closet constantly opening and closing to replenish your health and ammo. I'd suggest at this juncture that you turn off the game volume either in your OS's sound mixer or in console using `volume 0`. Stick on some music or whatever

What you want to do is put your cursor on the centre dot. Then, then back to the middle, then out to the next, and so on. [Here is a demonstration video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dU9-fN1Az0). Do this for the entire pattern. There's no need to do it in this particular order: if you want you can go to the first dot on each, then the second, working outwards in a spiral. The main point is that you return to the centre each time. Go as slowly as it takes for you to be precise. At the beginning you should be moving much slower than in the linked video. This is not meant to emulate real-game conditions, but to get your motions smooth and accurate. You can click on the dot to get a notification of whether or not you hit or not

Do this routine for ten or fifteen minutes and you should notice an immediate improvement. As well as repeating it to improve speed, or screen.

This was of particular benefit to me as a Spy

The training should also help you with Sniper quickscopes. Move your crosshair to the target first *and then* scope. Even with differing sensitivity in scoped mode (which can be disabled with `zoom_sensitivity_ratio`),False,,t5_2stfn,False,,,t3_oyecg

Anyways, taking out a lot of our players and making our defense more of a scramble to get damage out than anything. That was a decent time, in my opinion, considering the circumstances. 

Once we were on offense, like before, in a scramble to take down their sentry by means similar to throwing pebbles at it. 

This got me thinking. What were they doing that we couldn't manage? It's not purely dm, or many X-factors, that made them so much more efficient at shutting down another team. 

What do you think is so different about higher level play compared to lower level play? Also, and why do they work a lot better?

1370533148.0,1fsnkn,[PSA] Hatless hats crash your if you visit the loadout screen!,Rehtori,34,9,27,"E: Crash your game. Typos in titles are the best.

I just tested this. I only crashed when checking the Sniper loadout which i had the hatless Sniper hat on.
I then used item Quickswitch to switch a different hat on all of my loadouts. (Open quickswitch and press 6) And my game was fine. Before i had done anything when i clicked on Sniper my game would crash instantly

After i switched an Ellis Cap on i could watch my loadout for like a second. I had 4 loadouts all with the hatless Sniper on and it seems that after it loaded all the loadouts it noticed that they had the hatless Sniper on and the game would crash. Now that i fixed all of the loadouts to have Ellis Cap i can customize my loadout freely as long as i don't put the hatless Sniper on.

I'm assuming this affects all hatless hats.

E: It doesn't matter if you have a custom HUD or not.

EDIT: THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL PROBLEM. THE GAME CAN ALSO CRASH BECAUSE OF THE HUD.

In case you aren't aware, for you newer players, is a mode of competitive play in which there's only one member of each class on a team for a total of 9 players.  That means that no matter what your favorite class is, you can play and compete against other enthusiasts of all types.

So far, too - last season we gave away [Genuine Participant Medals](http://www.ugcleague.com/files/images/season6_medals_final.jpg) to everyone who participated in a full season of play, and we raffled off some nice unusuals to nine lucky winners.

This season we're mixing things up and trying out some new maps, so that you guys can open up a can of whoop-ass in the Fall season.

You don't have to organize a team to be part of UGC - a lot of teams are looking for new players!  There will be links at the bottom to our recruiting area so that you can join a team, Platinum and Steel.

So where do you get started?  If you already have a team and a server, where you can post your skills and join a new team that's just as awesome as you are.  Remember our first match drops on the 11th of June, so get on it!

**Direct question for people that don't like to read:** Should I livestream my MGE/DM sesions so you guys can learn anything/ be  entertained?

**backstory:**
I've been pubbing for around 1800 hours now
Now I read this subreddit for a while now and have read almost all the posts about getting into competitve play and how to get better and so  on
The one thing that is said numerous times is that if you want to be good at the game (death matching wise) you need to practice in MGE or DM servers or even better than normal pub servers (shoutout to RUCG servers) and I fully agree with that.
That's when I got this idea.

**The idea:**
My idea is to fully concentrate on DMing for atleast 100 hours in MGE and DM servers.
But I thought: Why should I do this on my own why not involve you guys?
So I came up with this idea that I can stream some MGE/DM sesions on twitch.tv and maybe do some youtube video's about MGE matches I had so I can be a helpfull contributer to the tf2 community.
I want to do it as perfectly as humanly possible so it's gonna take me some time to 1. set up and 2. to actually do it. 

So if you bared with me all the way through this wall of text my question to you guys is: Should I put some time into doing this or shouldn't I bother with it?

I look forward to all your opinions

**Where to Set Up**

1. Set up in a nice chokepoint where there are tight spaces and it's hard for the enemy to maneuver. This is usually a corridor in a building. Make sure that this place is going to get very heavy

2. Consider setting up in a place *behind* the front lines

**Where to Place Stickies**

1. Because you have many, you can place several traps. 

2. For the first trap, even with overheal. 

3. Next

4. Finally, and, hey, you can afford the stickies. However, you *must* place a trap behind you if there's a back entrance where the enemy can surprise you.

5. Back into a corner where you can't be backstabbed and yet you can see your traps. Also

6. Try and place these stickies where the enemy won't see them before it's too late

7. Replace your sticky traps as needed.

**What Not to Do**

1. Don't leave your spot unless you have to. The enemy could come out whenever

2. Don't go into direct combat. Use the sticky launcher if you want direct combat. The SR is an entirely defense Demoman.

**Additional Notes**

1. Turn ""Cart Glow"" on in your settings. This will allow you to see where you stickies are through walls

2. Make sure you equip the right primary in case the enemy *does* manage to get to you. If you'fe in a tight space, allowing both shots to hit for a kill.

3. Remember to never detonate your stickies while you're on top of them. Even though you're not looking at them

4. If you're on a CP or even a Payload, giving you an easy kill.",,False,,t5_2stfn,True,,

I've also tried running this set with the IW and the effect is similar in that I have tremendous ability to push through the line.

1371817367.0,1gsgo4,Rubberbanding issues after Steampipe,FreddyTeddy,33,8,4,"As some of you might know

Crouch-jump lag: When you crouch-jumped, 0 choke, good rates and 30 ping would still experience) it, but it still became worse the higher your ping was and the lower the maximum allowed rates that the server had was. 

Rubberbanding: Feels like you're getting teleported around randomly, in the sense that it could happen to any person with completely fine internet, ping and net settings, but it would still become worse the higher your ping was.

As it seems right now

From what I've noticed
Yesterday I also noticed that setting cl_predict to 0 can make it better.

Right now I'm trying to make a big part of the community (and last but not least Valve themselves) realize that the rubberbanding issue is NOT because of your internet connection - it is a nasty bug in the game that needs immediate attention. Besides that

So anyone who is still experiencing this rubberbanding issue

**Predictions**

12 &lt; mix 4-5 by highwayunicorn

Match of the week candidate right here, they made it close in the final rounds; maybe that loss will fuel them to practice a little harder and a little more. To best Fully Torqued, they will definitely need to - PYYYOUR's team has been doing lengthy map review sessions and working their asses off for Gullywash week with two tough matches to play. Seagull going against TLR on pocket will be a classic to watch for sure, and it might honestly come down to their uber exchanges as to who wins. Yz50 has been playing well in scrims lately and looks poised for a big game, but Justin's sniping plays should open some big holes in transition that will deny Yz's chances to make plays.

When I do that, the pushback sends me flying away from the action, rendering the whole thing useless. Eventually, I just switch to the Quick Fix for the pushback-cancelling effect, which sometimes (ie most of the time) ends up with me and my pocket dead.

A few months ago I started playing TF2 in a more competetive Setting. Mostly in Lobbies, I know it's because the enemy was just better than I was.

But then I joined a Team to compete in the Round Robin V. It was the first time I ever played with so many people in a Mumble in a competetive Setting (Highlander). This is when my problems began. Whenever I play with my team, stand and watch and I'm missing the easiest shots I can imagine and missing all my jumps (playing Soldier). These problems occur nearly everytime, no matter if we play in the Tournament (round robin), a scrim or just against some randoms in a lobby.

Much of the strategy I cover comes from my own experience, Highlander demos are very difficult to acquire on most of this season's maps (Foundry was an obvious one, as was follower).  Playing the current week's map in lobby only goes so far as to understand the current Highlander team mechanics.

Therefore, to understand how these maps are being played currently in order to provide a better guide for everybody.  I'd be more than happy to include your team in the thanks for the video and whatnot.  All I'd need is a few hours' notice by someone from your team that has the STV information.  Reddit works fine for getting me the information.

**FOR CLARITY:**  If you have a scrim on the next week's UGC map on Tues-Fri, scrims on Lakeside).  I want to start getting these articles on a regular schedule, probably Friday evenings.

1373699417.0,1i7hit,soldier melee thoughts (current patch),Sqozza,27,5,36,"I enjoy writing about this kinda thing, obviously. I'm going to try and cover my personal thoughts/uses for each melee in 6's

In the Escape Plan's current form, minicrits don't seem too bad, as the damage buff isn't too substantial (35%) and that's not *really* all that much if you're running away. But what really kills the weapon as an effective choice now (at least for roamers, pockets will still need it for rollouts, although after that it's up for debate) is the fact that minicrits have precisely zero damage falloff. This means as you're running out of Granary mid on 40hp, there's a fairly high chance you can be oneshot by a scattergun from across mid. 

I feel the best way to go about nerfing this weapon from its previous state without butchering it like so would be a % increase in damage taken, but maybe the same as minicrits bonus to keep the effect around at close range, while not ruining your day with 70 damage rocket splash from across a mid.

The Pain Train is pretty much my favorite thing, I feel this will be picked up by a lot more roamers, if not a large majority of roamers (I'm unsure for global unlock rules, so the whip is also a potentially viable choice, but I'll run over that shortly.) Before this particular update, the main reason to not use the paintrain was that the Escape Plan's ability to get you far far away from stupid situations that you manage to get yourself into as roamer was valued far more by most roamers compared to the ability to backcap and generally be a nuisance - I'm not trying to say it's a crutch by any means, rather that it was simply all round the best choice for most situations

Anyway, so I suppose that's something to take in consideration as well. In theory, this isn't too much of a penalty, turns a 100 damage shot into a 110 damage shot, meaning you'll get 2shot instead of...2shot. This is a bigger issue on demoman where you don't have 200 hitpoints, but I don't play demoman. You shouldn't really be picking 1v1's with scouts as a roaming soldier anyway, you should be baiting them around into your scouts, generally being a nuisance - this is your job as a roamer

As for the whip, and would give your team a reasonably significant advantage on rollout, under the assumption the other team isn't using one too. Demoman gets a 37.5% speedboost from the whip, so give him a few hits on rollout and he'll likely get there noteably faster than the other guy, which can decide a midfight from the get go.
