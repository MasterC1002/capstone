1375372653.0,1ji17f,Need help actually getting kids off my lawn,BEEPBOPIAMAROBOT,168,18,172,"Seriously guys

I own a townhouse in an urban area of Portland

My street has a ""gang"" of children. There are around 10 of them, which are all dead due to the heavy foot traffic. The climb on the trees and break off branches. They go through everyone's trash and recycling and use whatever they find to make ramps and other makeshift garbage toys. They yell and scream all day and all night. They ignore cars that drive up and down the road, causing people to honk their car horns all day and all night. They knock on my door every other day trying to sell me rocks or candy. 

It's a nightmare. I've gone to their parents' house and tried to ask them to help curb the insensate noise, and I've basically been told to go fuck myself and mind my own business. One of the fathers threatened to call the police if I ever spoke to his child, even if he was on my property. I don't even think all of them live on my street, this is just their hangout spot. The group of kids is growing, and as they get older, it's getting worse. 

Is there anything I can do? I would love to just move away

**Edit after reading comments:**

Thank you to everyone for the great advice. I've been reading all of the comments and have decided to talk with the local police about my best options. to answer some common questions/suggestions I've seen:

* I've lived at this location for about five years, but less friendly, since the unwanted soliciting began. The ""no soliciting"" sign has not helped, not that I really thought it would. 
* I live in a lower-income area of town because I decided to buy a house instead of wasting my money renting. When I purchased the house, I don't have spare income for any high-tech solutions. I really do like the idea of the high-pitched anti-loitering speaker system and the automated motion-activated sprinklers (although, as pointed out already, our standard sprinkler system in Portland is the sky). 
*  The ""yard"" is a bit too small for a fence
* Another concern is my car. I use the garage for storage and park outside (as does everyone on my street)

Thank you again for all of the help! ",self,t5_2sh93,1375415938.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditForGrownups/comments/1ji17f/need_help_actually_getting_kids_off_my_lawn/

Please

To set up yours it is simple:

 - You should see your username on the right bar not far under the subreddit title
 - Click the ""edit"" button next to your name
 - And edit away!

Let me know if you guys think this is a good/bad idea

*EDIT*: And while you're here, is still pretty finicky, so you'll see a couple posts that are 3+ days old if you look down a few spots on our home page.

Recently I've realized my being a slacker at work really might be holding me back, I run the area I work in practically by myself and do everything the manager of the area should be doing plus more, but again it basically goes completely unnoticed. Saying something about it won't do much good, I've tried it more than I can remember and well I'm sure you all know how it goes, nowhere. I know if I left the place they would be screwed (doesn't everyone say that tho?), but I'm not exactly where I could go that would be any better.

I've more than started to realize that I've wasted some good years of my life at my job and I'm completely terrified, not that they're bad (honestly, I'm lucky to have them), but some are in a similar situation, or have way too much going on for me to bother them. Sure there's my family, but I always get the same thing said to me, one of which I should move up in the company and it should be ""easy"" since I've been ""loyal and working there for years"", she said that in her honest opinion she wouldn't trust me with running an area and training other people, minus the title

That's also something that really gets to me, but I hardly see how that's something I can change. I am able to work under pressure most of the time and maybe take too much crap from the people I work with (including other associates and Management), but again that's really something I don't think I can change and (again) saying something about it won't do a damn thing anyway. Who knows, maybe the manager was right, I'm completely delusional and really just a terrible worker.

I feel alone and I'm miserable, I know I'm the only one who can make myself change things and maybe I should just man up, but hearing some words from people with real life experience is something I really need right now.

I know both sides of that make us sound awful

Here's a more specific question to work with - how do you budget the project?  I have a max number in my head, after all these years of waiting for a kitchen, that I am deliberately holding back money and preventing her from getting what she wants, and that the very idea of having a maximum number takes all the fun out of it.

Just start posting whatever interesting links, videos, ect. that you think this community of grownups would enjoy discussing.  And for that matter, start discussing!  If you see something interesting posted by a fellow grownup and you find it interesting, scary, thought provoking, or inspiring then make sure you let them know why.

Let's try to keep this community active as an oasis from the front page antics that brought us here in the first place.

Lastly, then please invite them to contribute!  And if you see one of those posts that are just *screaming* ""Get off my lawn!'"" then just tell the OP and anyone who agrees that we decided that rather than complain about it, we just decided to make our own little community!

So go ahead! Post whatever you want! We have no topical guidelines here.  It will just be nice to know that when you get into a discussion with someone in our community that you won't be punned into oblivion,False,self,t5_2sh93,False,,,t3_h6y1o

I (think) I understand the importance of having kids. I wouldn't be here if my parents had thought what I am thinking. But I find the sacrifices and compromises that people make for setting up a family disconcerting. 

I am from a developing Asian country, I find people with families going through the grind so that they can support their families. 

I never wanted to work at a job doing the same thing for years, sits in. But I find people in my office doing the same thing, because they have families to support. 

I have immense respect for these people and the jobs that we do. I know and undertsand the value that people doing their jobs bring to society. Even without getting married, have an emergency fund and have a plan. And then the risks may be lesser. And maybe they are true.) 

I am asking this question because something which a senior workmate said to me at work struck me. The impression I got was that he was continuing in a job, so that he can serve his family better when he is older.

I know I am being shortsighted about many things here. For example: 

1. I might want to get married later on. If I intend to do that

2. I have to be practical. I have to make sacrifices now

3. The world does not care about my interests. I have to work hard and make money if I want to live. 

But the reason,  I assume a lot of things to be true. But I am not sure and I want to ask those who have been through this phase of life if they have learnt any different. 

I assume that raising kids into ""responsible"" adults is one of the highest achievements of being a human being (I mean this positively and I don't mean to offend people who chose not to or cannot have kids.). I assume ""responsible"" means who raise responsible kids of their own and/or who contribute to society. But I don't know.

Similarly

I am grateful to you for reading this through. I am asking for something which is priceless
