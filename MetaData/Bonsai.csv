I'd like to see more beginners run out to the nursery and start chopping up plants. Crude wiring and root pruning to follow. Killing trees left and right will keep your excitement level up as you research. It's going to take a LOT of studying before you even know that you know squat. 

Finally, or taken from the wild. Big thick trunks are sexy (literati aside) and portray strength and age. This takes a **long** time. Rarely is a brand new practitioner going to sow some seeds and then 15 years later work on the material when it's ready.... Yes, it takes that long sometimes (i'm thinking pines especially but also fat junipers) 

The Japanese kept this a secret from us for as long as they could (as I've been told by multiple masters: Bill Valavanis/Roy Nagatoshi included) but now we know:

    

**Most good bonsai are cut down

Also

In conclusion:
    
Fat trunk &gt; Stick in a Pot

   
I'm not trying to poop on your dreams

Now if you're serious about doing this

Firstly big ups to this subreddit being super helpful to both novice and advanced hobbyists!!  I really appreciate all info present and posted, and down-right awesome ideas of keeping bonsai is that these trees can and will outlive us, and I feel that allot of beginners fail to realize that not much can be done with a 3-5 year old tree.

The tree has been in my grandfathers care for about 35 years but he dug it up when the trunk was around the third of it's current size. So estimating 50+ years old (could totally be off and it could be much older). My grandfather has had Parkinson's for about 15 years now and cannot take care of the tree anymore. For the last 5 years I have been taking care of him on a day to day basis and within the last 2 years I have been learning bonsai from him. He has explained some things to me in general and smaller tree care is fine but this is a whole other monster to tackle. Two people cannot even lift this thing on its own. The soil is weed infested, this tree is beautiful and jumping with life. There are days where I just sit and wonder how this thing has become its own ecosystem.

One particularly helpful tip was to seek out real live bonsai practitioners/enthusiasts/growers (what is the right term here?)  Anyway, who has an amazing collection and decades of experience.  A true gentleman.  Look him up if you're in the area.

In the span of a few hours, I'll pass on this great advice again.  Get out there and meet real bonsai people in your area, or find them on your travels.  Turns out they're probably far more welcoming than you might expect and you really can't beat the experience.  

It was great to see hundreds of great trees in person and be able to hear the stories behind some of them.  Rather inspiring to see trees in all stages of progression too; not just show pieces.  So, there really is no replacement for actual in-person experiences.  Picked up this neat little boxwood too.  I really dig its natural ""oaky"" style.

Since a few months I've been cleaning at a dentist's during the weekends and evenings. She has a very nice bonsai-tree in the waiting room and it's about 10-15 years old now. The previous cleaner was in charge of taking care of it

When I started working there, specifically two of them.

[Here are some pictures of the tree.](http://imgur.com/a/jCAgV)

- For the first branch, but I don't know if the tree can handle that. So that's what I want to ask you.

- I want to cut the second branch at the pink line. This was the branch I've pruned the most since I got there and has since grown quite full. However, to make the tree 'fuller'. 

I also want to change the soil and prune the roots

The dentist does have plant-fertilizer there

The location of the tree is in the waiting room, but a lot of natural light. In the winter it's colder (waiting room isn't very warm) and during the summer it's warmer. I believe the tree is experiencing all 4 seasons, but more moderate than it would outside.

Hi - I'm new to this subreddit and wanted to share my ""bonsai story"" by way of introduction. As you read it I am sure you will find it a bit sensational but I assure you every word is 100% true...

I've been growing bonsai for 5+ years and started like most people do; alone and confused. Friends and family rolled their eyes

Many dead trees later

Everyone seemed friendly enough. I had brought a couple trees I needed to re-pot and showed what I could do. I got some good pointers and tips from various members, there were obviously some very knowledgeable people there.

A couple months later the Pres had arranged a trip to visit the bonsai garden of some old ""bonsai hermit"" type guy. I asked for the address and phone number and offered to meet the prez there. He said ""sorry""

Once there, each capped by a round concrete slab of varying diameter. Upon these pedestals the bonsai were arranged...like some incredible fantasy bonsai stonehenge. I wandered among them for about an hour, utterly in awe of every detail. Every time I asked the price of a tree the bonsai hermit; rail thin, leather skinned, and crazy gypsy hermit scary looking (with a lazy eye, even!) cackled at me, ""that one's not for sale, heh"" over and over ""not for sale""

Long story short, spooky bonsai hermit guy laughed when I whipped out my plastic. ""Cash only, buddy, ha ha ha!"" - I didn't have enough.

I took out every last dollar I had and handed it to him, just bring the rest then."" I said thank you and extended my hand to shake his. He reached out a frail leathery claw towards me and smiled, steel gray eyes probing the depth of my integrity. I looked down at his hand to shake it, and noticed for the first time it was covered with tattoos of lightning bolts down the length of his fingers. I shivered in 85 degree heat.

Fast forward to the next club meeting. This guy was doing a demonstration on air layering. When he was done I asked if he had a minute. He said yes and followed me to a quiet corner. I paid him the remaining $ I owed him, I can't pay ya nothin' but you'll learn a lot.""

From that day until this

Incidentally his family bought him a cell phone last year. He promptly stuck it in his back pocket and I left it be. One day out of the blue he asked me if I would do him a favor and put my number in so if he needed to call me he could. He handed me the phone and I realized I was entering the first name in memory. I guess I was the only person he could imagine wanting to call. That kind of stuff will mess you up if you're not careful.

So I am proud of my bonsai teacher, and I do my best to practice what I have learned, but also question and challenge it. 

I'm here because I love bonsai and hope to meet like minded and help those with questions. Maybe have some of my own questions answered

Thanks for reading my story

[Spruce](http://imgur.com/70uNVKX) I just picked up today for $25

[This](http://imgur.com/fw5pMR2) is [going](http://imgur.com/doOcrwp) to be my [pride] (http://imgur.com/MDuBTAg) and joy. This big japanese maple is about 6 feet tall, I got it for $90 when it was marked at $370. I am very excited to start playing with this one.

[Cute little cypress](http://imgur.com/XUByUpC) I bought a few days ago as well. It will probably be about 1 foot tall when it is done. It has two main trunks, but I got it on the cheap and think I could make something work.

[Larch](http://imgur.com/8yOyvPe) I bought earlier this year from a nursery. It is about 2 feet tall. Japanese Larch to be more specific

[Red Maple](http://imgur.com/MHcMFvn) that I dug up this spring that was going out of the foundation of my house... It is short

I have only been doing this for 2 years now, and really there is only one way to learn this shit, and that is to try it out yourself. Sure, you could ask r/bonsai for advice, and they may tell you don't do it, but you never really learn your lesson, and you never really learn if maybe your method would work.

Really, well you learned something didn't you? And if you only killed a branch, then woohoo now you get to learn how to deal with a dead branch! It is all a learning process, and from what I have seen on this subreddit newbies are often afraid to try something new because they think killing a tree is a huge deal. It isn't, things die, go buy another one and don't do what you just did again!

Drinking alleviates these thoughts. 

Here is what I just made: [Fuck yeah!](http://imgur.com/fDSNFdM)

He is a Juniper my mother bought for me after I killed my previous one, but you know what? Fuck it.

That is also soil that I made myself for the first time

That is another idea new people need to keep in their minds: ""Fuck it."" You wanna try a type of tree that isn't frequently used or do a style that isn't frequently done in that style? Hey man, you send enough lead down range you are bound to hit your target sooner or later. Just replace lead with trees. And target with what you want your tree to look like.

We vote with our purchases, or only buy groceries from sustainable grocers. In both cases the consumer is ""voting"" for both a product they support and the means of providing that product. For each $5 mallsai purchased dozens more can be produced, and our consumption of that product is an incentive for the vendor to continue using the same means (or more harmful means) to provide. Therefore I would urge the bonsai community only to buy from reliable nurseries that create their products in a way you can support, rather than ""rescuing"" a mallsai and giving business to an ignorant vendor.

^ Gallery of my Juniper’s condition. 


Here is his life story:

I've always really liked bonsais and I wanted to start to get into them so I asked for one of the amazon junipers for Christmas, so I had been keeping it on my shelf during the night as it was still getting cold, (I live in north Kingstown, Rhode island) an then bringing him outside and sitting him on my patio during the day. He was doing fine, but got some mites (you could see the little webs and black dots on some of the needles). I used my mom's alcohol soap and water mixture that she uses to kill bugs on her orchids to get rid of them and he seemed to bounce back.  One particularly windy day he fell off the ledge, or I must have had him only half on there :( I scooped up all the dirtish/gravel mixture that the nursery had him in and plopped him back in. as you can see I wasn't able to get all of it and now part of his root ball is exposed. He came home a few day's later as the semester ended and he's been back on the edge of the coffee table in front of some large windows (as seen in the pictures), he's looking real bad now though and that’s where he had been all winter without a problem. I've been making sure to water him whenever the top of his soil gets dry, but the rest of him has gotten really brown. Any ideas why? What should I do to save him? I know he’s an outdoor plant but since he had been doing better inside with my mom’s care than outside with mine I thought it was better.

tldr; Juniper bonsai browning
