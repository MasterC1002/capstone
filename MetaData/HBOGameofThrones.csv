Many of you are accidentally leading the show watchers to ""the right decisions"". It sucks to watch you guys do this

We want this subreddit to stay open, and for the show watchers to find refuge from the spoilers. But that means you need to step back. No background information from the books ever, no leading to the right information, no ""speculating"" about the future. The current ratios of posters in this subreddit are stupid. 60% of the posters are book readers, 10% are read alongs, which is fine as long as you can separate what is in the book and what is in the show. There are entire threads of book readers speculating and arguing with each other... with not a single show watcher posting. And the book readers are trying to post as ""show watchers"" since they are taking care not to spoil. But honestly, it is just stupid. 

All of us book readers have had the chance to speculate

If you have had children what you are doing right now, but only if it was asked for, or the report button to bring something off to our attention. You can't stay in the kiddie play house and not hit your head. You are too tall for that. Stand outside, watch, and let them grow on their own.

1368667715.0,1ef8nu,My thoughts on the Theon Greyjoy torture storyline,SirWhositOfWhocares,75,26,17,"I was incredibly fed up with it. I was going to voice how pointless and annoying it is after E07

I thought the Theon storyline was sorely lacking the rest of the story's characteristic commentary on human nature

The significance of Theon's torture isn't about causing pain to a helpless being. It might seem like he's just a chained animal

Everything he's done to him has revolved around forms of torture that you could never subject a non-human animal to. The things he is exploiting in Theon are the things that define our humanity. This reveals something intrinsic about what it is to be human: our constant need to ask ""Why?"" and to understand our experiences and surroundings gives us a greater capacity for both joy and suffering.

The thing he leverages to psychologically torture Theon is the same thing that has given real-life people our gods (""Why do we exist?""), obsessive questioning of ""why"" everything.

The torture of Theon shows that no amount of pain inflicted on your physical body can rival the damage of taking away your sense of meaning, of seeking understanding and achieving a sense of purpose in life.

With this in mind, and a little curious what aspect of human life will be examined next. Whatever happens in life, I can always be thankful I'm not coping with amputated genitals while being tied to a cross in an undisclosed location.",Spoilers Free,False,,t5_2tzv3,,http://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/1ef8nu/my_thoughts_on_the_theon_greyjoy_torture_storyline/

&gt;
&gt; ---
&gt;
&gt; **Season 1**
&gt; 
&gt; Lannisters march for Tyrion:
&gt; 
&gt; * *S01E07* 5:30 min in - Tywin says he'll give Jaime half of 
&gt; his forces
&gt; to the Vale to free Tyrion.
&gt; 
&gt; The North's march for Ned Stark:
&gt; 
&gt; * *S01E08* 40min in: Robb says his scouts report reinforcements for 
&gt; Tywin's army from the south (don't know if it's from King's Landing)
&gt; are headed to join up with Tywin's 30000
&gt; larger than Tywin's 30000. Robb then tells his mother the
&gt; Northerners have 18000 at that point. Tywin gets reported Robb's
&gt; forces have rushed into The Neck. A couple minutes later
&gt; battle map shows he's past Greywater Watch
&gt; with Jamie's forces a little southwest of Riverrun
&gt; south of the river
&gt; Lannister scout who says he counted 20000 Northerners before he
&gt; got caught (I don't know if he's lying).
&gt;
&gt; * *S01E09* 6:45min in - Theon says Robb has 5 times more men
&gt; than the Freys do at The Twins
&gt; ton of foreshowing in this scene btw). Frey gives all of his men
&gt; except 400 to Robb under the conditions. I'm assuming Robb is
&gt; +3600 at this point
&gt; Tywin's forces. Jamie's forces get wiped out
&gt; loses on either side after this battle near Riverrun.
&gt;
&gt; **Season 1 Summary**
&gt;
&gt; Starks and their bannermen = approx. less than 19600
&gt;
&gt; Lannisters = +60000
&gt;
&gt; Daenerys = Three baby dragons.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; **Season 2**
&gt;
&gt; * *S02E01 - S02E04* - Robb says if he allies with Renly Baratheon
&gt; They'll outnumber the Lannisters 2:1. Salladhor Saan says Stannis
&gt; has the smallest army out of all the kings. Renly + Tyrells stand at
&gt; 100000 men. Robb has another battle
&gt; Stark man
&gt; 
&gt; * *S02E05* - Stannis gathers the Baratheon bannermen fighting for
&gt; Renly while the Tyrells take their army to meet up with Tywin's. I
&gt; have no idea where Renly's assassination takes place nor how their
&gt; army was split up.
&gt;
&gt; * *S02E07-08* Robb's forces are located south of the Pyke at The
&gt; Crag to negotiate a surrender
&gt; realized until now he's right above Casterly Rock. Tywin's army heads
&gt; to King's Landing before meeting up with the Tyrells.
&gt;
&gt; * *S02E09 - S02E10* Stannis vs. the Lannisters/Tyrells. I didn't try
&gt; very hard
&gt; either episode.
&gt; 
&gt; **Season 2 Summary**
&gt;
&gt; Starks and their bannermen - Still approx. less than 20000.
&gt;
&gt; Lannisters + Tyrells = +100000 I'm assuming
&gt;
&gt; Stannis - After a quick glance
&gt; of men in Stannis' army
&gt; 
&gt; Daenerys - 3 Tiny Dragons
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; **Season 3**
&gt; 
&gt; * *S03E01 - S03E04* - Robb's forces are at Harrenhal coming all the
&gt; way from the west. He then heads west again to Riverrun for his
&gt; Grandfather's funeral. No numbers still.
&gt;
&gt; * *S03E05 - S03E08* - Robb beheads Rickard Karstark and loses
&gt; ""almost half his forces"". If the 20000 was correct before
&gt; means the remaining forces are at 11000 - 12000 men. He heads to
&gt; Casterly Rock again
&gt; men
&gt; 
&gt; * *S03E09 - S03E10* - I've just realized this was all for naught

---

I left out some parts that were already written in the comments like Lady Olenna telling Tyrion in S03E05 18 minutes in she donated
&gt; 12000 infantry men
&gt;
&gt; 1800 mounted lancers
&gt;
&gt; 2000 in support

to the Crown.

Daenerys stands at 8000 Unsullied and 2000 from the Second Sons.

1) You don't like the post because I am calling you out. That is fine

2) You are a book reader who thinks that our rules are horrible and wrong and why would we ever do that! Please go back to /r/gameofthrones and /r/asoiaf if you can't follow our rules.

So what is going to happen is I am going to quote what I can in every call out that isn't spoilers or book knowledge

We already know that the Lord of Light can bring people back

I feel like there is something odd about them completely erasing the entire Stark storyline (no I am not including Arya or Bran's story) from the show in one fell swoop. It also seems odd that they put a whole lot of effort into showing the power of resurrecting Beric only to have Melisandre pretty much say ""Thats cool bro

I think that Brienne is stronger and has a better reach. Jamie I think is probably more agile and a lot more experieced in battle. I also think that Jamie's arrogance is a disadvantage since it might lead him to be oerconfident.

Full strength Brienne vs. full strength Jamie. Place your bets.

*Hey /r/HBOGameofThrones! I'm a book-reader so  when I visit this subreddit I just read people's posts without commenting, and I envy that). I've posted this discussion of the Music of Game of Thrones in the big GOT subreddits with some minor spoilers but after a post here talking about lack of content, I removed every spoiler from this document so I could post it here. There's no book or show spoilers here! The only ""spoilers"" would be the names of the songs on the soundtrack, if you count that - like saying ""the song Huge Chicken on the Season 2 Soundtrack"" would spoil there's a huge chicken in season 2.

I worked hard to eliminate every book-spoiler and to clearly mark even the slightest spoiler of any show episode

---

I love Ramin Djawadi’s score for Game of Thrones and think he’s done a great job with it. I think it’s fun to identify the themes and motifs spread across the show and the soundtracks. I’m in the process of trying to identify all the different themes and motifs in Game of Thrones

I’ve done a youtube link to every occurrence(that I’ve identified so far) of a theme or motif in the soundtracks, but I’ll list the time the theme or motif occurs at anyway so you can check it out if you own the soundtrack yourself. If the link’s down, you can always just youtube the name of the track that I provide yourself, then follow the timings I provide (like 0:15 seconds, or 1:43 seconds) to find the spots in the track that I am talking about.

---

**Some Notes Before I Start:**

GOT S1 OST = the Game of Thrones Season 1 Soundtrack

I’ve titled the themes the names that I like the best and make the most sense to me, regardless, and that’s what matters.

Lots of the tracks use more than one theme. In my iTunes

http://imgur.com/fy7vjuU

I’m posting this to a few different places; the General Game of Thrones (the TV Show) board on westeros.org ( http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/forum/39-general-got/ ) 



---



**Nine primary themes or motifs:**

---

**Main Theme :**


I call this the Main Theme because it’s the theme of the main title

---

“Main Title”

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=q4faDId9J7U#t=8s

0:08 seconds

---

“The Kingsroad”

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=muBoV4fmfnw#t=8s

0:08 seconds

---

“Jon’s Honor”

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=0w4pxZ0EeXM#t=83s

1:23 seconds (I’m referring more to the swelling notes than the distinctive rhythmic march the main title uses)

---

“Game of Thrones”

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=TYNnv8qPR88#t=10

0:10 seconds

---

“Victory Does Not Make Us Conquerors”

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=1HGFlelKc4o#t=55s

0:55 seconds

---

“Three Blasts”

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=VZUkIMXv7-g#t=96s

1:35 seconds, and belongs here.

---

**Stark theme**

I call this the Stark theme because it always centres around Winterfell or any of the Starks. It’s pretty sparse, it’s quite an emotional piece.

___________________

Some moderator suggestions:

- Don't click on any threads, etc that haven't been flaired by the mods. We do sleep at some point, but while we are awake we flair the content that is posted in the subreddit. This keeps it so that we know which things we have approved and which ones we have overlooked as well as giving labels for all of you to know. 

The Four Labels are: 

- **Business**: These threads are completely spoiler free. Anything about the series must be tagged as such. Someone who hasn't watched the first episode should be able to look at these threads without having anything spoiled for them even that [S1E1](/s ""Jon Arryn is dead"")

-**Spoiler Free**: This means that if you are up to date on the current episode, a discussion of who your favorite character is or a where who is thread. Any additions to these threads after the episode it is flagged for or dated for must have spoiler tags put on it. Spoiler free also means that any speculation must be tagged.

- **Spoiler Thread**: This is a thread that has spoilers from the next episode in it, as well as the TV guide short synopsis. Occasionally there might be a GRRM/Actors panel that might be posted. Check the comments for where to avoid the spoilers in the video, a comment like that will be required in every one of those threads.

- **Speculation Thread**, you will be instantly banned for posting in these threads.  Even if it is simply to correct spelling or make a silly joke. This is for the show watchers only, a place to speculate without worrying about being led or spoiled. No speculation tags are needed in these threads until the next episode occurs. Then any new information must be tagged.

- Do not EVER look at the comments on articles or videos posted anywhere that has Game of Thrones content.

- Know that we as the mod team will never ever tell you if something is a spoiler or not. That in itself spoils you.

- Know that if we are asking for sources on a post it is because it is one of many topics that we randomly selected for that point simply because we knew it would come up. Some points are extremely valid, we will still ask you for sources so those topics that are book reader only knowledge when asked for sources will not pop out to any of you.

- If you have any questions about something that you googled by accident or pop up feel free to PM me or send in a mod mail instead of asking in one of the other subreddits

- Do not look at anyone who posts in this subreddits post history. Many of the helpful book readers in the explanation threads on this subreddit came directly from spoilers all threads in /r/asoiaf and /r/gameofthrones.

A few show watcher suggestions:

- Avoid the other GRRM network subreddits. While a valuable source of information




A book readers suggestion:

- Read all the books. This is a last resort because we will be sad to see you go.

* As we saw in the lineup
* Walder owes Robb and his house nothing. Why then would he give away his most beautiful daughter? He may be conniving
* No one had ever mentioned Roslin before Frey's proposal. You'd think *someone* would have noticed her in her twenty-odd years and she would be the talk of the seven kingdoms. Again

&gt;*""If the lamb sees the knife, fouls the flavor.""*  
&gt; - Melisandre

- Frey needed to keep the groom and the Northmen happy. Up to this point he had been more than kind, and Robb and Co. wouldn't have been off their guard. 

So who is Roslin (if that is her real name)?

* Frey took/bought her.
* A volunteer from one of Frey's vassals who did not want their house caught up in the war.
* A gift of Tywin Lannister; (a) because Walder responds well to pretty girls

When to use tags:

-When discussing something outside the scope of the thread. For example the Episode discussion threads

-When speculating outside of the speculation threads use speculation tags, or obvious the speculation. For example, Theon is being held by a [no spoilers speculation](/b ""rampaging rhinocerous"") or Varys is working for [no spoilers speculation](/b ""Bruce Wayne""). Basically if something has not been explicitly stated, it is speculation. If a character states it, it is fine. If it is shown on screen it is fine.

The most rampant nonusage of speculation tags are in the episode discussion threads. Please use them in the future in these threads.
___________
When not to use tags:

-No tags are required in speculation threads.

-No tags are required when talking of events that are happening on screen in discussion threads.

-No tags are required as long as you are posting in the scope of the thread you are posting in.


EDIT: As a reminder, it is a ban, same as the weekly speculation threads.

Ok maybe not specifically who but atleast what family. I won't give away the spoiler but their sigil has been seen before on the show and a quick google search showed me who the family was. My question is how does Theon not know who it is. He basically is the living version on the sigil. He was a highborn person who should have been educated on the history and families of Westeros. The only thing I could come up with is that he is too delirious to remember but if he was able to give names of other families last episode I figured he would have remembered that sigil.,,

I feel he would be fair and has experienced both the higher class living/people and the lower class living/people (on the wall)

Who I think will end up on it: Dany. Her perseverance is unmatched and she has the dragons to help her get there.
