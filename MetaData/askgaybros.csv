I came across Macklemore's Same Love song a few weeks back before my baby girl was born and I fell apart. I cried for hours after watching that 5 minute video on Youtube. I couldn't imagine feeling any different for my child other than the overwhelming love a parent can have. 

I know some of you guys had great homes

I love you. You are an awesome person, someone to build a life with and share all those experiences. You are better than some title or label. You have people, even random people you've never met, that will love you and support you on your journey through life. 

As a new, sadness, love and acceptance you all should know and expect from everyone around you.

Oh jeez


Edit: Thank you all for your gratitude. For being a non-participating member, as over the past few months I've confronted my values and my empathy for others. Not to say I was hateful or anything like that before, but I can suddenly understand the entirety of my parent's struggles, both in their marriage and in parenthood.

From that I was able to regain a sense of humility and a perception shift of the human condition. I suddenly appreciated my significant other more than anyone else I've met. I've accepted another man's ( a term I use very loosely ) children, innocent and unknowing, enter this world that I helped create and will help shape for the rest of my days on this planet. 

My mother and father separated when I was 5-8 years old. During these years, yet productive periods of re-establishing my relationship with my dad, he told me that the thing that brought him back was the song, Cat's in the Cradle.

What's the ""So what?"" of all this babbling? I suddenly have true love in my life. Not hollywood bullshit

I was at my friends house hanging out playing video games, he must have forgotten to turn it off before I came over. I was a tad shocked not only because this guy has had a girlfriend for three long years, but also because I was actually turned on by the video, I came to my senses and turned the screen off and we continued playing video games. 

Later that night, and the next night.

We had decided to get together that weekend to watch Arrested Development from start to finish and I spent Thursday night actually contemplating fooling around with my friend

We watched the first two seasons on Friday and at the end of the night I asked him if I could sleep in his bed, but I was way to terrified to do anything. Saturday came and we continued to watch, some guys and his girlfriend came over but left early that day. We spent the evening on his bed watching and laughing until we decided to go to sleep. We were both lying next to each other quoting Tobias and GOB when I looked at him and I don't know why but I went for it and kissed him. He was too shocked to do anything, I removed my face and he said ""what was that"", I said ""I don't know."",  meanwhile panicking on the inside, wanting to run out of the room but thankfully he smiled and we made out. We fooled around a little that night and it was awesome. 

The next morning was very awkward and he told me that we would finish the show later and asked me to leave. He left on a family holiday on Monday and he's coming back on Saturday and I'm freaking out

**I'll start off by saying that this title is more rhetorical than anything else.** 

A lesson I'm re-learning consistently is that guys are increasingly afraid of being the one who just says ""no"" when it comes to advances from another person.

1. ""I'm busy"" 

2. ""I'm tired"" 

3. ""Rain Check?"" 

4. Or if I send something by text. The answer can sometimes be ...Nothing at all. 

Don't get me wrong

The only problem with these answers is that they offer hope. After getting these type of  replies

1. ""How about tomorrow? What works for you?"" 

2. ""We can go later after you rest if you want!""

3. ""Sure! Name the date!""

My dad reacted even more aggressively, and homosexuality is a Western influence and a result of me watching so many movies.

She asked
But now it was as if all my fears were unfounded, so if I'm happy then i should do what i want (albeit begrudgingly the way she said it), IT'S MORE THAN I COULD EVER EXPECT from her in such a short period of time.

So thank you Reddit gaybros! I could not have done this if it wasn't from the all round support i received from friends, yet. Nonetheless, I am more than grateful that my mum loves me enough to uproot her beliefs and accept me for who i am. She's not fully okay with it, but I love her so much for trying.

1369711430.0,1f6fcs,[UPDATE]:Hi/Thank You all/Coming out,Brochitect,40,4,16,"This is a followup to [my post yesterday](http://redd.it/1f2w4y)

It is done/just begun. I came out to my parents today. There were some quiet, I'd say it actually went swimmingly, all things considered.

Before I broke the news, it was beating stronger than I've ever felt it in my life. It was really the strangest sensation. Back to the story, I was sure to get all of my stuff packed and set by the door (I was just visiting home for the extended holiday weekend, so it wasn't like my parents were suspicious) just in case I had to make a quick exit. Luckily, I over-prepared.

I filled up my water bottle, aimlessly browsing and checking email, and off to my right, turned away from me, my dad's sitting in his recliner watching the French Open. I try to look as relaxed as possible, watching tennis over my dad's shoulder as my parents occasionally make small talk about figuring out what to do for dinner tonight. Meanwhile, I'm sitting almost right between them, and try to prepare for the impending fallout when I completely annihilate their world.

What sticks out to me as the absolute hardest part of coming out was the seemingly monumental strength it took just to open my mouth and say the first few words. I sat at the table for what ended up being a solid hour, covertly pulling up /r/askgaybros on my phone and rereading the comments of encouragement on my post yesterday, trying to find that strength to start talking. After realizing that an hour has gone by, and realizing that the only words I've been able to string together in my mental script are ""Well, I think I should hit the road, but before I do, there's something I've been wanting to talk with you guys about..."", and that I need to just nut the fuck up and get it out. 

So I deliver my opening line that took an hour to craft, find myself able to keep saying exactly the words I needed to say, without stopping, stuttering, or stumbling over myself. Realizing that I don't want to try some perfect story arc that builds up slowly to some dramatic reveal, I was able to pretty quickly and directly say the ""I'm gay"" part before the end of my first breath, and then started explaining more after that.

One of the first points that I took special care to make clear was that my being gay was absolutely nothing to do with them, and she even told my right then that she still won't be able to accept my explanation, and can't help but blame herself at least a little bit...somehow. She doesn't know how yet, but she will. And trust me, no matter what I say, she'll take it on herself to try and find a way to make it at least partially her ""mistake"" so that she can have some glimmer of hope of ""fixing"" it. While I don't know if it's exactly the word she was looking for, she did say ""disappointed"" more than once

Meanwhile, like ""how long have you known?"". I found that anything I could answer in some kind of numerical format gave him something to grab onto and start to process and fill in some kind of spreadsheet in his head.

In the end

And so, trying to account for every possible reaction they might have, and then formulating every possible counter-move I could think of. The whole thing played out like a game of chess in my head, and I think we ended up at a perfectly satisfactory stalemate. I'm really just glad to see that they are going to take some time to think things over, and true to their engineering routes, aren't making any rash decisions before taking any kind of action. With any luck, they'll get used to it after some time, I'm hoping that they'll even accept it

I closed it all up by saying that while I don't just want to drop this news and run, but then didn't want to have a cloud sitting over the entire weekend, and that his way we were all able to enjoy family time yesterday. We got to the point where all they needed was time, so I got up, grabbed my bag, we all hugged goodbye and I got one last ""we still love you"" for good measure, then walked out and drove off.

The best part to all of it was that for at least the first hour of my drive back home tonight, most complete feelings of happiness and accomplishment I've had in a long time.

I've been for a while with my bf. He's older than me; he was (and is) my first guy. When we first started dating, clinging to this idea in my head that yeah, I might be with another dude but I was still a manly man. I tried to fuck my bf once, as I wouldn't even consider it being the other way around, but it just didn't work; I got soft very quickly and after that first disastrous attempt I never tried topping him again. 

Fast forward a couple years: my bf and I have a good sexual dynamic now, but I simply can't get rid of the nagging thoughts in the back of my head that make me feel ashamed that I'm the one being fucked. I know I'm just stuck on a stupid, old-fashioned view where gender roles are this overblown thing that defines my sense of self-worth. I know, and my bf has told me countless times, that bottoming doesn't make me less of a man in the same way that being gay doesn't. I am also aware of the fact that bottoming or topping are a dynamic, fluid thing that varies with partners, situations, in their eyes. I also have these internalized feelings where I think it makes me weak to be the submissive partner in the relationship

Have any of you guys ever felt this way? I could really use some advice other than 'go to therapy to address your clearly deep-seated issues with societal restrictions on gender-appropriate expressions of your sexuality.' I can't afford therapy. I guess I'd just like to hear from  somebody who understands.

He didn't shy away or anything. Just said it doesn't change a thing for how I feel about you. We are ""official"" now.

I've been in a relationship with another guy for nearly six years now. He is the first guy I've ever been with - when we met I actually still had a girlfriend, coming to terms with the fact I am gay, coming out, etc etc, and my boyfriend has been with me through it all. We love each other very much and I can honestly see myself spending the rest of my life with him.

But. My bf is almost 10 years older than me, whereas I've only ever been with him. He is able to tell me that he's been around, seen it all, and that he would always choose me over any of the others, and often tells me how lucky he is to have found me. I feel the same, but in my case I don't have that experience of past relationships like he does. And I get... well, I guess curious, to try out different roles from what we've established in our relationship

I haven't been unfaithful to him or anything, and maybe I'm just complaining mentally about how I won the lottery on my very first try with him without having to go through the entire dating/searching thing for years and not finding the right man. I've already got the right man... but I can't help thinking that maybe I missed out on something by never being out there, experimenting a bit, and so on.

I've been in a relationship with a really amazing guy for four years now; two years ago he caught meningococcal septicaemia (meningitis), he'll probably never walk again and he requires carers for everyday living.

*deep breath*

I still very much love him, but he has also become self-centered, seemingly unable to comprehend my feelings and emotions and only concerned with his own. 

We've not had any sort of sex since before his illness because its so bloody complicated (I mean literally, etc), even trying to figure out how it would work and what we could do causes me anxiety - we've never been a very vanilla couple and because of the severity of his disability, we're not able to do any of the sort of fun things we like to do! We've spoken about it a little bit but hit a wall pretty quickly. 

Out of all of it though

He can leave the house with help but its very challenging, putting a lot of pressure and stress on me and usually resulting in me not enjoying whatever we're doing. He doesn't have enough strength to self propel more then a couple dozen metres, so I have to push him everywhere. He is understandably scared when we go somewhere so he is never grateful and I feel horrible for even trying.

I'm only describing the tip of the ice berg, I love and care for him but I'm getting nothing out of our relationship, our situation has been described as ""all of the disadvantages of being in a relationship with all the disadvantages of being single"", I could leave him but we'd both be devastated or I could stay in the hope things will get better.

So he's in the locker room and as I'm leaving (he was in a different row of lockers near the door) we made eye contact (like most bros, to acknowledge someone they see all the time, I guess) and sort of ""hey how're you?"" type talk.  As I was about to exit the locker room he was like ""Hey, I really like that sweater thing you have on.""

So I turn around, it is. I'm trying to remember where I got it at."" 

And of course I couldn't remember, thanks"" (awkward smile from my end at that point).  Then basically we were all ""yeah, have a good one,"" to each other. 

So, random stranger in a coffee shop and I have made eye-contact once or twice?  No problem - I'll go up to him and I have a pretty fail-safe script that really minimizes damage if they're straight (they usually are, I've found).  But I'm much more comfortable doing that with strangers, or people I know I'm not really likely to encounter again if it's a no and/or they're straight.

I know there's no way to tell if someone is gay or not without asking, or do I ask him out and just have it be hellishly awkward after if he says no or is straight?

Last Sunday I went with several friends to watch Iron-Man 3, approximately halfway through the movie, I felt particularly bold (or stupid) and put my hand on my best friend's leg...

Now, I've never done anything with another guy but I've had... fantasies). So, we have a very close friendship, and physical contact is common between us, we hug a lot and when we get alone we have sometimes kissed on the cheek. He has always told me how we values our friendship and that he loves me a lot. Now you get why I am so confused, right? That's why I have my hopes up with him, although I don't even know what I expect myself...

So back on track, but as he has never rejected physical contact with me, even at this point, I decided to take a risk and move my hand slowly upper his thigh. I was nervous but he did nothing to stop me, so I reached his groin area. I stopped but left my hand there. I felt like if it got warmer and warmer if that is even possible. I waited to see if he rejected me in any way, but he did nothing. After a while I started fondling that area, I honestly was looking for touching his dick or balls at this point but I felt nothing... That is when Ian turned his face towards me and whispered to my ear: ""Careful, I just thought ""fuck it"", but there I was, he even make remarks about it with me! In my mind I was like ""is this really happening or is it my imagination?"". I was getting horny

Now the sad part of this story... I was very excited to say the least, as I said we are best friends). When we got in the car with the others we were next to each other but he was silent, I tried to talk to him but he said he was sleepy (it was night). I felt a little down, I somewhat expected some funny remarks about what happened or just *something*, but he didn't say anything. That night I jacked off thinking about the experience that just happened (I needed some release too, lol). On Monday I was thinking about it all day, I wanted so bad to talk to him but I didn't see him that day. At night we chatted on FB a little but just inane things... He said he was busy doing homework and didn't talk much with me... Today (Tuesday) some friends invited me to play soccer and he FB chatted me that he was going too, so I went but he showed up very late... He said he went with other people to play at another place... Now, he talked about other girls too (how he gets the attention of other girls and his girlfriend gets jealous) When he was about to leave I said to him: ""hey bro

Guys, just thinking about it gets me horny but I feel like it's not the same for him, I feel like has not even thought about it since then... I was expecting some commentary from him, maybe telling me that he enjoyed it at least... In the best scenario maybe he cannot stop thinking about it just like me... My hope was that I make him horny the same way as he has always made me horny. But I don't know what to think or do anymore...

Do you guys have any advice? I know this went too long and maybe it's not that interesting

Apologies in advance for the wall-o-text. I tried to break it up to ease the reading

My gender identity is pretty set. I was born male and I identify as male. I see myself as a male and there's no shaking in that idea. However I do like be a bit of a genderfuck when it comes to how I dress. Sometimes I just like a simple pair of bootcut jeans and a button down with some boots. Other days I'm in some skinny jeans, and it makes me happy. I'm able to look at myself in the mirror and be pleased with what I see. 

And besides all that, I do love shopping and Lady Gaga. But I also enjoy guns (there is a .45 Smith &amp; Wesson with a dark cherry wood finish that I am DYING to buy. Will look quite nice in my burgundy Coach purse. Fucker will set me back about $1500 but I'll be *damned* if I get caught not packin heat in a dark alley one day). I'm a die hard Michigan fan (GO BLUE), and if you touch my fucking grill while I'm watching over my ribs, you'll lose a finger.

I say all to say that while I identify as a femme male, I also don't want to be coddled. I've dated many guys in the past who feel an urge to ""protect me"". One ex of mine even taught me how to properly fire and use a gun (while that did start my fascination with the subject, my point of him feeling it was important to show me that stands). I am a man and as such it's almost dehumanizing in a way to be expected to act like how ""woman should act"" or that I have to be watched over in a similar sort of way.

Sexually I'm a submissive, I am a guy. And I find I don't really have issues, like the ones I describe above, with this when it comes to guys who are Doms within the fetish community. Only when I'm dating average joes who just like to get freaky in the sheets.

I guess I just want to know what other gaybros' expectations are when it comes to dating fem guys? Is there some unwritten code I'm missing in how it's supposed to work? Or am I right in thinking that I shouldn't be expected to act and be ""the woman in the relationship""? And what can I do to prevent these kinds of mixs up? And lastly

If there's something I'm doing wrong, or they may, be doing that leads to this idea that I want to be treated as a stereotypical female. 

I should be clear

**TL;DR: I'm a fem guy who expresses himself as such and is comfortable with some aspects associated with a more ""feminine"" gender role. However I am a man

*Side Note: I don't want anyone to get the idea that I think a woman should be treated in the ways I described above.

I’m a 19 year old guy who doesn’t know who I really am. Everything in my life is pretty great, I absolutely love my college, my Fraternity, my major, everything, except for one thing: my sexuality. I’m not straight. I guess I know that for sure. I’m bi, maybe even gay. But I’m so afraid and I feel so alone in this. Nobody would ever know I wasn’t straight, fun, work out a ton, I’m a virgin. I didn’t grow into myself until later in high school

But, and I can pick out an attractive guy just as easily as an attractive girl. I want to hook up with a guy so bad, but I’m so afraid to put myself out there. The fear of not being accepted, of being bisexual or gay, of labeling myself incorrectly, of growing up to never have a wife, all of these things have been crippling me in the past year. I’ve gotten really depressed, so I just fake it and seem like a totally optimistic and happy person. I’ve ALWAYS been the person people come to with their fears and problems, I’m gay? Or maybe I just need to go all the way with a girl

I think it really just comes down to fear. I want to be straight so bad, and I’m afraid I don’t have much time left to come to terms with it. Someone please point me in the right direction, I just don’t know what to even think anymore.

**UPDATE #1**: So curiosity got the better of me and I went and downloaded Scruff. I bought the full version so I could adjust the exact location and time people were on. Here I was chatting to a guy named 'x' who had no location tracker on, and I start pushing the conversation too much with 'x' when he stops talking. Suddenly 'westieboy69' (he lives in the west of Sydney) starts chatting to me out of the blue with a profile picture of an obvious model I might add. One I have definitely seen in magazines before. I post up more fake photos, he realises something is up. Within 20 seconds that profile is deleted but located at the exact same location as 'x' I g through Manhunt and search 'westieboy69' and I am greeted with a profile located in the suburb right next to him, with no stats and his profile reading 'hi guys GWM dte and a great soh so just looking for friends' yet it lists in his likes 'Sex in public' which my boyfriend just recently told me he wanted to start having sex out of the bedroom, and we ended up having sex outside.

**This is fucked up.**

**UPDATE #2**: So I continue talking to this 'X' guy, rather ambiguously 'Freaking out a little bit?' obviously me referring to the situation at hand, not him being pissed at me. He replies instantly 'No sorry we just got back from dinner and my phone died. I'm not pissed mr I said this.' I don't reply, an hour later he sends 'Mr?' to which I say 'Yeh I know just feel real bad is all mr x' obviously alluding to the profile. He doesn't reply. Meanwhile I am still speaking to 'X' and I ask if he has any more pics. Instantly my boyfriend logs onto Facebook, after it being 'on mobile' (which it never is) for the past 2-3 hours whilst he is at dinner (what does the on mobile mean btw?) to which I think is to source more pics. By now I am fuming, so I send a message to my bf saying 'Can't wait for those bjays when i get down there!' 'bjays' spelt the exact way he did it. Straight away 'x' goes offline and his profile isn't searchable anymore = deleted or I am blocked. My boyfriend messages back 'Ummmm what? And don't mr guilt doesn't suit you' 'XX'

Now here I am, you need to be completely honest with me right now, cause nothing adds up here' He flat out denies everything again. He doesn't mention the 'bjay' message at all. He gets angry at defensive. He says that we will talk when he gets back and hangs up. I message him back saying 'You have got to understand from my position, what you did with your phone was suss, what could you possibly have to hide from me, if it isn't this?' No reply. So I send another message 'X is you right?' Now I see he is trying to type a message, deleting it, deleting it for about 10 minutes. I can't wait any longer so I ring him

I say the same stuff over

I won't bore you with the rest of the conversation

I have 3 theories in mind: 
1. He is cheating
2. This is a weird kink
3. I think he is seriously fucking psychotic and living through other peoples fake personas.

FUCKING HELL

**UPDATE #3**: This just get more fucked up as time goes on. I just realised I spoke to a guy on Scruff the Tuesday night after I first caught him in the petrol station, down to the freckles. I was speaking to my boyfriend on Facebook at the time and asked him a question. He took like 5 minutes to reply when every other reply was straight away. In this 5 minute window the guy starts chatting to me. Same typo's and everything as my boyfriend. My boyfriend logs off Facebook to go to bed. Straight after this guy says 'I'm bed' [sic the kinda typo my bf would make] 'Tired' I ask for a face pic, when suddenly all goes quiet, and after 10 minutes he sends me one, one I swear I have seen on Facebook, one of his facebook friends. He sends two more, one obviously a fake pic of someone else, but what caught my attention was the doonah (douvet?) in the corner of the photo. EXACTLY THE SAME AS MY BOYFRIENDS. This is a pretty weird doonah as well, I left hanging out with his friends because I was so embarassed/pissed of at myself/upset with my self and I made that pretty clear. This dude messages me 'So...into kink?' 3 minutes before my boyfriend messages me 'You alright to find your way home mr?'

Now I talked to this guy again on the Friday night

Sorry for typing so much

**TL:DR - Either this is the biggest chain of fucking coincidences in the history of mankind and I am going to look like a fucking psycho

**ORIGINAL POST**: I'm actually 99% sure I caught my boyfriend looking at Scruff the other day. I was filling my car up at the service station, but I noted that I had definitely seen that app before, I just didn't quite know what it was. We had dinner and said he can crash at mine tonight (I live like 5 minutes away from his work, whereas he is like 40 minutes), and he said he had to drop his snowboard and stuff over to a mates place, kinda far away. I spoke to him after and he said ""Ah nah, just dropped it off to [another of his mates]"" which is like a 5 minute drive away from him

I was browsing through apps last night

I confronted him the other night and asked him if he was using what I think he was using on his phone. As soon as I started speaking and saying ""So you know how we went out to dinner the other night, and he put in his passcode wrong about 3 times, which is really not like him. I believed him there and then and apologised and felt like an absolute dickhead. He said he was a little pissed off, but he would rather that I ask him, and that I should be able to talk to him about anything.

We went to grab some dinner and I noticed he was acting a little odd, but in my opinion things like this don't happen unless there is a reason. We were walking past a hairdresser and he started talking about how this poster of a girl was really poorly done (he is a graphic designer). He started saying how it was all out of alignment and stuff and then he said ""And her hair doesn't match how clean cut the rest of the image is, her hair is all scruff......y"" and as soon as he mentioned the word scruff his voice dropped in volume, said it really hesitantly, and just completely trailed off. Writing this now makes me feel like a complete idiot, but I think I am fairly good at reading people, and this just really caught my attention. 

If he was using the app just looking for friends

Another thing, weird and emotionally unavailable, and I will mention it and he will breakdown and say what is up, usually only when he is drunk. He has done this a couple of times in our relationship (we have been together nearly 10 months now). I like to think he wasn't using this app hooking with other dudes because he is fairly insecure and things have come up in how he is really afraid of losing me, thinks that eventually everybody leaves him. He did mention once however, that with a past boyfriend, he was on Grindr before they broke up with a fake profile. 

The fact that he acted all surprised, it is pretty uninspired (I have also noticed recently he has a little trouble cumming, as in I can't remember the last time he has) has got me a little worried. Part of me feels like an absolute douchebag for asking him, and believing this, but some things just really don't add up for me. I have probably been over thinking it a lot, so I don't know what to think. Could I get an unbiased, second opinion here bros?

I really want to talk about it with him again as it is still on my mind

* Met this guy on Grindr almost two years ago
* We had coffee a few times initially
* I have not instigated a coffee-meeting after our first one.
* Dude has always been kind of shy and quiet in person to some degree
* From the beginning, etc.  
* He has taken most of my advice, moved out of his parents house, and generally seems waaay more independent now than before.  Obviously I take only a teeny-tiny bit of credit for this... he was at the age where all these things were ripe to happen anyway.

Now

We haven't talked in about a month (which is fairly normal), he wants to come out and see me where I'm house-sitting.

So I agreed, which is a little late for coffee and/or hiking.  

He's also occasionally dropped various subtle and not so subtle hints that he is interested in more than coffee and conversation.  I've always laughed them off

I guess my questions are: 

* Am I encouraging something here that I shouldn't be?  
* If you were (or are) an early 20's bro on the other side of this situation

I'm not interested in this guy romantically.  I'm sure being FWB would be hot and all, as I feel that would be crossing a line I set up from the first time we met.  That said, if he wants to use me for practice, I wouldn't necessarily say no....  but that's where my questions come in.

Also of note: I'm a decent looking cub-type guy

TL, I'm conflicted about letting anything happen at all.

EDIT: Perhaps another, while ideally boosting his self confidence at the same time?  I realize that simply saying that and being complimentary is the simple solution, but I know that at that age I was a lot more sensitive than I am now, and I don't want to screw it up.

We go to different universities so I don’t see him that often, when my other friend decided she wanted to go to bed, but Nick and I wanted to stay up so he suggested going for a walk. On this walk we were basically just catching each other up on recent events in our lives, when he out of nowhere asked me if I wanted to go back to his house and hook-up. This had literally left me in shock because A) he has always identified as straight B) he is one of my really good friends, and C) I have always found him to be attractive.

I was really conflicted with what to do because here is this really attractive guy that wants to hook up with me, trusts me completely, and that he really wants to do this. So I nervously agree, and we hook up. 

It was great. I was really afraid it was going to be awkward the next morning, he responded with “Don’t be sorry, it was a nice treat after a hard week, thanks :)”. 

I am super curious as to what this experience meant to him. Was it just a onetime thing (with me, or offend him. I also want to let him know that I am here for him, if he wants to talk about possibly being bisexual or gay (if that’s the case).

**So here’s my question:** Should I talk to him about this? If so how should I go about doing it? Or should I let him come to me on his own terms? Am I over thinking things?

Sorry for the novel and if this type of question has been answered before. Thanks a lot in advance!

I graduated college from a decent school, earn enough that I plan to buy a home (without a mortgage) in about a year, and am just starting to see the results from working out I've long wanted by never previously achieved.  However deep down, I feel a great need is not be satiated. 

I read all these posts about other peoples experiences and wonder how this has been passing me by.  I'm not so naïve (well perhaps I am) to be holding out for the perfect guy.  That would almost certainly result in never meeting anybody.  I have friends

Here are a couple issues I see.  One is my job.  I've been promoted to the top of my company.  I have a lot of autonomy and freedom at work (posting here is but a tiny slice of my liberty) and the pay is good.  However the hours are long (12 a day plus 2 hours of commute everyday) sometimes for weeks at a time.  Beyond that I move around the country a lot (I worked in 4 states in just 2 weeks this spring

14 hours a day may seem like a lot

Another problem is I am what I believe is called a ""straight acting gay guy"".  My outward demeanor is so straight that even when I tell people that I am guy

I have met guys on line who I became friendly with, mostly about politics, economics and history and have about a 1000 subs.  About a year ago I hit of on the genius idea to use it to meet guys and started making videos about being gay, very much to the surprise of my audience.  I have since been contacted by several guys, though not near so many as I had hoped.  Some of this attention has been very flattering.  How many of you can say they were the essence of life's fulfillment to a Married Gay Mormon in Croatia? (Yeah I've gotten that PM).  There have been others from Australia, the UK, France, and other places far afield.  While its nice to meet such people

I realize this is a lot of venting and condensed autobiography, or thoughts you guys might have to offer!

Long story short, woke me up by pinning me and tying me down and then raping me and taking my virginity.  It's been a traumatizing few years but I've become a more confident person since.  I feel like I can now protect myself if I get into a situation that I need to, but that I am not as closed-off and can be open emotionally to others.

Which brings me to the main question.  I'm thinking about bottoming for the first time now since my rape.  Every hookup, I always have topped.  But I know that I would enjoy bottoming physically.  I like fingering and have even tried a dildo a few times.

But I am hesitant about the emotional aspect.  I don't like the idea of someone pinning me or dominating me (obviously).  So, fellow survivors of sexual assault, or people helping me figure out a way to talk about it with my partner. 

Just some info - I'm in my mid-twenties

EDIT - Thanks for the advice.  I appreciate it.  

I should have been more clear.  I am not considering bottoming in a hookup.  I'm a little too scared with a stranger obviously.  But in my next relationship (which may be very soon with a guy I am seeing)

I have sought out a lot of counseling and I am also a rape crisis counselor for the Sexual Assault center in my area so I am pretty educated on my recovery process.  I have been doing well for a while now and more empowered.

I recently (yesterday) drove someone I cared about away, and for the first time in a while felt confident that he liked me. For the first time ever, I could tell someone was focusing all their attention on me. But I couldn't comprehend why he felt that way. 

He was so much more attractive than me

One night I addressed it. I told him it wasn't his fault. I told him it was me, and wanted to know what the problem was. He wanted to be there for me to help me through it. So I explained my self-loathing to him. He understood- he wanted to help me. We had a deep, long conversation. We talked about past relationships, our lives, our fears and dreams. Then, he confessed, in a way that melted my heart

Then, but we went to see a play both Monday and Tuesday, and after each we just parted instead of spending more time together. Yesterday he came over and expressed anxiety about our relationship. He truly cared about me, but didn't know if he could help me. He didn't think I loved myself enough, and that his being with me was hurting me more than it was good for me. He thought now was a bad time and to call this off for now. I told him, in one of the most logical and calm moments I've ever had, that I understood. I told him I was of course, but that he was right to do what he thought was best for himself. He said he wanted to stay friends or in contact

At first I felt a little panicked. My first instinct was to throw my sneakers on and go for a run. I did. I never run. I ran for 15 minutes. That's a lot for me. I stopped at CVS

That is fucking awful. I have to change.

Why couldn't I just see this for what it was? Nothing sinister, while we were breaking up ""This time last week I was the happiest I've been in a long time, and now, it just feels strange."" 

Because I'm sick and need to get better. Even now, twisting it to mean that he just wasn't interested, or there was in fact someone better than me. But I know it's not close to the truth.  Why can't I just accept it? I need to get better. It's sad that it took him leaving me to realize it, but I guess we have to lose something to gain something.",,False,,False,t3_1gwv8d

A few months ago, NYC, Baltimore, Alabama.  At some point, I started developing feelings for him.  I didn't say anything at first because he was dating another guy and I respected that.  Eventually, though, they started having problems with their relationship and he would turn to me for either advice or comfort.  I tried holding it together, and that I might not be the best source of advice.  He understod and was cool about it.


They broke up, who was a really nice guy, and I was happy for him.  I was crushed, though.  After they broke up, he started seeing random guys he'd meet on grindr - sometimes it'd lead to them hooking up, sometimes it wouldn't.  All the while, though

After a while, he just didn't feel that way now.  That wasn't what I wanted to hear, obviously, but I understood and I tried to respect it.


Things were somewhat normal for a little while.  We still hung out every weekend, but I knew it was hurting our friendship.


Last weekend, I explained that I loved him, but that I couldn't go on like this.  Every time he went out with someone new, I felt the rejection all over again and the feelings of inadequacy.  I told him that I'd always be there for him, but that I needed to walk away and figure things out.  After he read the card, he told me he understood and that he'd be lucky to date me if he could change the way he feels.  But he can't, and I don't blame him for that.   No one controls the way their emotions work.

This monday I finally came out to my parents after a whole year of studying the problem and considering my options...I was even going to a psychologist for mental preparation. I took them there so that

Well, and she said that for now she doesn't even want to touch the subject and that she is extremely dissapointed in me. My dad was completely surprised, he said that never even crossed his mind. With the help of the psychologist, I tried to tell them that many of my past mental problems (OCD, depression) seemed to originate from my own struggle to not accept myself. I used to feel constantly alone and was always cleaning myself too hard, like my hands and my genitals were always dirty.

But still, my parents locked their door, and next day I could hear them crying a lot on the kitchen and talking about something, but I didn't wanna get too close. After that, my dad wanted to have a conversation with me.

He said that this is wrong and that I should be a man, that I was like that since very little, and though I never had sex with a girl, every time I tried to get closer or make out with one, I felt this feeling of indifference, like it wasn't doing anything for me.

He said I wasn't trying hard enough, I can do anything. Well, he tried to make me not go to the psychologist, he thought she was putting wrong ideas into my head...he agreed for me to go as long as he went as well. Follow more of her trying to convince him, but he was having none of it. 

In the end, and was still sure of being gay...he only said that I shouldn't let myself be influenced by others and that I should go through with whatever I wanted (but the way he said looked like he wasn't going to accept it if it went to the ""wrong way""). That was the last time I saw my psychologist, because my parents don't want me seeing her anymore. I told him I would try to search for a relationship with a girl or maybe a prostitute to try what he wanted.

See, I still live with them (don't live in USA, it's normal for people in my country to live with their parents until this age). I don't want to create a bad atmosphere and though I know they won't kick me out, I don't want them doing their best for me to go away from here (Just finished my master's degree, unemployed and short on money at the moment). 

These past days, nothing's gonna happen to me and that I should trust them, but I feel they are very expectant on me finding a girl as soon as possible. My mother is already talking to me and my dad hugs me sometimes, but I don't know if they're like that just because I said I'd try to find a girl.

I decided to tell them because I trusted them, and this completely killed my libido and I'm not feeling attraction for anyone, man or woman. I'm feeling very alone and I don't really know where to turn to...besides, now they are cranking up their religiousness, talking about God on almost every subject and trying to act like nothing's wrong even with me looking always down.

I don't know, she wants to be understanding, but is having a hard time and she fears the path I might take...my father answers anything with something like me ""not trying hard enough"")

Our work situation is a little unique. We are in the same department

So

My question is this: Is it too much for me to email him at work asking for his personal email address? I was thinking something really discrete and straight-forward just asking for his email and letting him know that it's perfectly fine if he doesn't want to share it. If he does send it

**Edit:** Even though i have concerns about the existence of this sub

**Edit 2:** After a couple comments I had decided to just send him a simple email with my email address saying I'm giving it to him if he wants to use it

**Edit 3:** It half way worked itself out today. I'd been putting off visiting his site for a couple months to pass some info and since I was near his building I took the opportunity to swing by.

For some background information, if anyone asks, I tell them the truth and the truth occasionally slips out regardless of a prompt. I haven't had many problems with bigotry or homophobia around here and I'm grateful for that.

I know that a large part of the gay intimacy (I'm not labeling it as dating, I'm not condescending in any regard. I'm a sex positive individual in every way, besides the fact that I myself am not so apt to go into it personally, if you get what I mean. 

The thing is, which, granted, is capable of being changed, sex would be something I would do to please my partner more than something I would ever want myself. Maybe I'm just not into it yet or whatever. Who knows? I'm without a doubt sexually attracted to men and at times I fantasize about sex itself, yet the idea of myself going about and having sex just doesn't sit right with me...

I totally repressed my sexuality - to the point where I really wouldn't think of hot guys in a sexual way. I mean, since guys tend to 'go for the kill' when I'm not ready.

I also learned not to second-guess myself. I tried the whole hook-up scene that most guys are into. I thought that maybe I would like it if I gave it a try, do things when you want to.

Another thing I realised about myself was that I tend to value long term benefits over short term - in general. I've never been a fan of the 'live fast, they're likely to be much better.

With all that said

I still haven't lost my 'top virginity'. I'm a reasonably horny person in general

It just seems to be an endless cycle of nothingness and loneliness. How many years does it take just to find a guy that you just click with? I think that I'm just too different in what I want to find anyone. Coming out has made little difference to my life. I'm still hopelessly single and lonely.

When I was about 15 I was pretty much convinced I was straight and Kind of fell head over heals for this one girl that I had known a long time and we got pretty serious I was pretty much a member of her family at this point and her family was one of those types that loves to joke around and usually I could take it and dish it back pretty well but the only jokes I kind of took sour were the ones where they made fun of me saying I was definitely gay and placing bets on when I'll come out of the closet. In middle school I was harassed a lot and a lot of people thought I was gay and so Iv always been a little sensitive about that kind of stuff. We went out for close to a year and then we broke up pretty roughly 

Since then Iv come to terms with my sexuality and of course high school was much better than middle school and no one even cares what your sexuality is and most people think I'm straight because I went out with this girl for so long. So its safe to say that people questioning or even thinking about my sexuality is pretty much non-existent.  At first this was a huge relief for me because it meant I never really had to consciously act a certain way or be afraid to be flamboyant at times. 

lately the more I accept my sexuality the more it feels like I need to come out. The benefits of coming out all seem to be there for me and I have a great group of friends that I became close to through my schools choir program and actually 2 of them are gay themselves and the group is entirely fine with it. I know if I were to come out I would be accepted and nothing really would change other than me feeling comfortable talking about who I think is attractive.   

However

I also don't like the thought of people who previously thought I must have been gay and have only recently it feels like come to accept that I'm straight hearing this news. I have a fear of them thinking about that part of me for some reason.  

on top of that I'm really scared that everyone knows and bringing it up would be completely pointless and actually just make my sexuality more of an issue in my life.

I'm 24, and I've never denied being gay to anyone since. Now, I don't know if this means that I'm a self-hating gay person, but I greatly enjoy not being immediately perceived as gay person by other people. I prefer that people get to know me as a person before they associate me with a sexual identity (even if they are gay friendly).

I'm sure I'm not the only one here who gets confused for a straight person,"" but I don't know if I'm inspiring any real tolerance in people who would otherwise avoid me or hurt me in some way if they knew.

To cite a specific anecdote, ""why do you defend the gays so much?"" and I asked, ""why do you think?!"". He turned bright red and left the classroom.

For a month after, and never returned my calls. I felt so sad when this happened and cried a lot, but I decided to give him space. After that month, he called me and apologized, but said he never met a gay person before and felt deceived that I never told him. Our friendship is intact today, but it was a really awful feeling and I felt that it was my duty as a friend to instill some acceptance into him for who I was.

I guess my concern is two-fold and can be summed up as:

So here's the deal. My best friend and I are both married and unhappy. We originally bonded over this displeasure for where we are in life as well as our wives are so so similar. Anyway, we both still hold our faith in high regard, which is confusing I know). After that ""outing"" we got pretty close, always meeting for drinks or coffee to talk about how we are trying to cope with these lives we feel trapped in. If he gets a divorce he'll loose his job too (it's complicated) and I have 2 kids.

Anyway, right? So we texted until the wee hours of the morning and then ended up meeting for coffee when we woke up. Awkward conversation made us retreat to the car to drive around. And he kissed me. And my world exploded. We drove around a bit, groping eachothers cocks and making out a ton. Then parked and he climbed on top of me and we starting grinding. And then we stopped. Both scared that this could ruin our friendship. It was like we were caught up in this new revelation and our hormones took over.

Now I can't stop thinking about him. I want him in my arms again. I want to feel his lips on mine. But at the same time, but he's afraid of loosing his job. What I'm most scared of is loosing him as a friend. I love him deeply, in what way I'm not sure, but I care. A lot.

It's always me that arranges when we're meeting or what we're doing

I was hanging out with a friend of mine.  Back in the days when I was deeply in my heteroregression stage she and I tried to date.  
I came out to her

Fast forward a few months and she said that she met a new guy who has this roommate who is gay and she wanted to hook us up.  She said ""if I can't be your wife I want to help you find your husband.""

She was right in setting us up!  He is very sweet and we hit it off.  He's a bro like I am.  He has a good head on his shoulders and he's fucking adorable.  We met at a group get together and we quickly broke away from the group and had coffee and chatted for a long time and really hit it off.  But

I have been chatting with him on and off for some time and he just told me that he broke it off with this other dude.  I have been really careful not to let this relationship go into the friends zone

How do I negotiate this fellow bro's?  What's my next move?  How do I get him on the hook

The only problem is that he has crippling insecurity.  I don't hold it against him because I used to have my own issues with it, he was really nervous about meeting me to the point where he almost flaked on me (he was really late the first time and he said it was because he was in his car, building up courage. He hasn't been late since, though).  

Initially, he initially comes at me as if I'm not doing my part.  Guys, I practically surgically attached him to me and made an effort to introduce him to everyone.  Fuck, he met at least 20 people both times.  

Guys, I find him *incredibly fucking sexy* and I don't know how to get him to realize this.  Sex doesn't help, either, which is almost funny considering we have fantastic chemistry betwixt the sheets.   However, he makes an effort to wear clothes when we do it and he'll have the light off.  The sex is still good, but recently, I've been having problems enjoying it because while I love topping him, the last time we had sex

(For the record, ie. assuming I'm just itching for someone 'more attractive.')

He stopped with these pedestal comments for a while, it's all about how guys are secretly wondering why we are together.   He says because a guy smiled at me, people don't assume we're together because he's so ugly.  His words.  This drives me insane and makes me sad because he's really not.  He might not be conventionally attractive, but none of that matters and I've sat him down and been really serious about conveying this to him (in addition to how I feel about him, how my friends like him, how he's nowhere near as awful as he thinks he is).  He doesn't seem to get it and I'm at a point now where I'm wondering if I've exhausted all my options and its time to move on.   What do you guys think?

I am 21 and a student at X.

To date, I ignored it and pretended like I didn't notice. By the end of the night both times, the girls were drunk and pretty assertively told me that I should come back to their dorm rooms. It was to the point where I would have had to tell the truth or flatly rejected them. Not interested in losing friends, both times I drunkenly whispermumbled to them that I was gay. I felt bad, as they both seemed slightly put off by it and were probably embarrassed that they had been coming on so hard. Both times, I felt 1000x more embarrassed than they did and also felt pretty ashamed, anxious, I found a reason to leave pretty soon after I told them.

I also know that I have been ostracizing myself from them since the incident because of my own pathetic insecurities and I fucking hate it. Is there a low key way to let them know without ruining our friendship?

1361821378.0,197ixj,He's a bottom - I have ED. What to do?,ThrOHawayOH,17,1,24,"Hey gaybros. Been in need of a little third party advice

A little quick information about me. 21 year old male, as I always just bottomed). ED is just one of those tricky things that can be hard to find a root problem. I have low testosterone, and so I have just recently started working on replacement therapy with my shit-tier urologist (who is shortly being replaced). And while I am ever hopeful that one day I can unleash my inner top at long last, I am trying to maintain a sense of realism that this may... well. This may just not be the fix I need.

Here's the situation. I just recently met a phenomenal guy. He's cute and quite a catch, he really just has no interest in it, which I totally understand (That and he has a dangerous curve that would make anyone squeal). Fortunately enough, he is being quite the doll about all of this, which is really putting my mind at ease a ton for the time being. However, I'm concerned - It is one thing for him to be cool for the first bit while I wait for my testosterone levels to regain a sense of normalcy (and hopefully fix my ED), but there is no guarantee this will work

So I guess my question here is two-fold. Do any of you bros have an experience with ED? I am trying to just... get an assessment of all of my available options and concerns I should pursue to make sure that I have all of my bases covered. And of course

It should be noted I have a script for Viagra at the moment, especially considering my young age, its limited supply, and ridiculous cost. For you bros who haven't been on ED medication before, it is quite the little hassle, as it does sort of take a little bit of planning, and can really take the... random and spontaneous nature of sex out of the equation

And of course, do note that reddit is not your doctor and the advice given should not be listed as fact.

Thanks for all the insight. Just want to make sure I'm doing anything and everything in my power to make my body and this relationship work :).

I came out this past March. I have been pretty certain about being gay for a long time but in my mind I didn't really want to be.

As I'm getting older and seeing as I have never been in any type of relationship, but I just don't know how. I'm completely comfortable with being gay and the thought of meeting a guy and being with a guy couldn't make me happier, but I just don't know how to go about doing that.

I am aware of of those apps such a Grindr

I'm in my 3rd year of university and it's the pointy end of the semester. I had a lot of work this week

There was [a thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1f74dw/post_a_voice_clip_and_guess_the_ops_background/) on r/linguistics the other day in which people were posting recordings of them saying something, to see if I could fool anybody. I posted the link, and the next night I went back on Reddit and had a reply. This guy had told me I sounded a bit like a French Canadian, and linked me to a video of [Xavier Dolan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Dolan), a gay québécois film-maker. It was nothing incredibly profound. I closed the laptop. Decided it was bed-time.

Lying in bed, because it wasn't a life that I could see myself in. I always backed honesty in other people, and have repeatedly given advice about self-acceptance, and being who you are and not giving a fuck about the rest of the world. But it was advice that I wasn't entitled to dole out. I wasn't following it, despite believing it with my whole heart.

I didn't sleep a wink. I was too scared that if I fell asleep I would wake up in the morning and forget how resolute and determined I felt about changing my life and being honest with everybody. I fought off sleep until 6am, hacking, ugly, awful sobs. I'm not an easy crier but I didn't manage to pull myself together throughout the whole ordeal - I weeped as I told mum that I hadn't been honest with myself and others about my sexuality. 

My mum was entirely fine with it - I knew she would be. In fact, and continues not to be, but he did say that he supports me no matter what, although rather begrudingly. He can't really look me in the eyes or speak to me at the moment but I'm not angry with him. I'm sad that he is so upset, but I understand, sympathise and forgive him. He comes from a foreign culture where it is seen as unnatural. He'll come around in the end, I know it.

I sat my sister down to tell her

In the same day I told my two best friends. A female friend of mine living in Mexico (Skype was not my preferred platform, and has gay friends, but weirdly, moreso than his reaction, I was scared about the actual interaction, and the saying of the words. He was high when I told him, which wasn't amazing. But he also reacted positively and said something which (again!) almost made me cry.

""You will never be my gay friend A

Right in the feels

Anyway, like I have often read. I still have a lot of people to tell, most of whom I am sure will react in a positive way. But, again, I'm not worried about their reactions - I just am scared of saying the actual words out loud to people.

Something I have realised is that I still feel a bit ashamed. I spent so long hiding, even though I'm out to my immediate family and best friends, I still don't like to say the words. You might have noticed that I haven't used the word 'gay' yet to describe myself. The reason is, I don't like saying it about myself. I'm trying really hard to discuss it with my mother, but I hate saying things like 'coming out', 'gay', 'homosexual' etc. My mum said to me something that started with 'Well now, as a gay man'

I guess what I'm asking is - did you guys also feel this? In theory I am happy to be gay, or *how* this is going to affect my career-choices, or *how* I am going to tell my grandfather. It still feels a little bit wrong to me, even though I've taken the right steps in trying to be honest and out.

**A guy is developing feelings for me faster than I am developing feelings for him. This is the result of a combination of my life experiences and that we have only been able to see each other once. At the end of the post

I'm in my early 20's and will finish my undergraduate degree in 1-2 years. After that I'm off to grad school - probably in a different state. I'm a double major (in the natural sciences) and regularly take 20+ hours per semester because I think it's fun. I'm the guy that finishes the homework in a couple hours that took everyone else days

I *like* caring about people

When I was growing up I was bullied for being different and the kids I made friends with betrayed me. It got so bad that I had to switch elementary schools. It wasn't until middle school that I made friends I actually kept for a long time. By the time I made it to high school I'd learned how to read people and figure out whether I could trust them

I have around 7 friends I consider myself close to - the ones I can talk to. I have talked to them about this

I am sexually active. A lot of guys consider me good looking

A little over a month ago, and I know he is someone I could fall in love with. The process of me getting to that point is not easy, and could take years. It takes about a year for me to consider someone a close friend (~2-4 months for me to think of them as a friend). He makes me happy - I find myself smiling when talking to him on the phone or texting. We text a lot.

He lives about 90 minutes from where I go to school during the year, and has a stable job. His mother is not okay with his sexuality, and will not let me come over. So he has only been able to make the trip to see me once. We play online games together, and usually Skype so we can talk.

I have some feelings for him (at no point have I tried to keep myself emotionally distant with him as I normally do others)

So now I know that he loves me

There are several options I'm considering

1. **Seek professional help.** I'm not sure how normal it is to keep myself emotionally distant from most people, games, and writing).

2. **Tell him that he said he loves me.** I don't want him to think I'm not interested - just that it takes me a while to really warm up to people. Should I be up front about what he said and that I do not feel that way yet?

3. **Seriously date other people.** I've never seriously dated anyone before, there might only be a few guys that are right for me in ways not immediately obvious.

4. **Tell him to back off / slow down.** It is possible he will try to move the relationship faster than I'm comfortable with,False,,t5_2vgfw,False,,,t3_1f1hpj

I have a... unique fetish. I have met ONE person online over the past 10 years that almost exactly shares my interest in this. It's mild compared to some of the crazy stuff out there. Nevertheless, big feet, and off-kilter body preportions. Further, the idea and concept of each or all of these growing to rather large size. As a little child, I was fascinated with the size of mens feet and hands. It made me very shy, and I dare not speak anything of it, but something about it gave me that little childs butterfly in the stomach feeling when ever I saw someone who possessed them. On one particular occasion that stands out in my mind, the power rangers grew to huge size. I stared fixated at the tv

Later as a teenager and around when I hit puberty

Fastforward to now. I've grown into my sexuality, feet, and height, but I am going to focus on the first two mostly, since they are the strongest.

I wish I could articulate properly what I find so sexually appealing about big hands and feet, the first things I look to next is hands and feet, and how big they are, and if they are abnormally large for their height. (time to get descriptive! yay! I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous...) When I look at them, sometimes in my head I imagine their hands and or feet to start growing bigger and bigger. Feet bursting out of their shoes, hands growing to the point where they can't use keyboards anymore. Imagining how they'd react to this, how being touched by hands that large would feel. The strength they'd have, lest I get hard in public. I have to be attracted to the guys face for any of this to be appealing

Then I'd imagine it happening to me. Ultimately, meaty mits. Then have my feet grow out to 30"" by 12"" or bigger. Over the course of months, or years, or maybe a few hours. I want that to be me, more than I want to see it with someone else (although I would love to do it to a boyfriend). Then have to live with it, adjust my life to accommodate for it. How even navigating my home and dealing with daily things would suddenly be a huge challenge. How just feeling that sheer level of size would be like. It's a hugely sexual turn on. I will state that I know this will never happen, and I have done work on myself to not become disillusioned by it all. It's still a desire though. It's still a want.

I already have rather big feet and hands for my height, big hands are by far the biggest turn on for me in a guy (big feet is a close second). They don't necessary have to be longer than mine (which is a mild challenge to do), but thicker than mine. Just being able to hold hands, touch, and be touched does so much. Big feet is another close second. Ultimately I have found that I like strangely shaped guys. It's been heavily influences by these innate attractions.

Here's a visual aid (for science) for what I am talking about, and long upper body, thick stocky build, long arms, over-masculine face), but the hands in particular are highlighted for obvious reasons. Given the option, if I could become this, I would.

I have only ever told this stuff to people online

* **TL;DR** I have a sexual fetish attraction to inhumanly large hands and feet

So yeah... that's my fetish (or the most major one anyway)... what's your reaction/thoughts? I want to see how a general gay audience reacts to this? I am braced for anything

We had been dating for almost 7 months and I have never been in a relationship that moved as slow as this one. It took a month and a half before we shared our first kiss. Almost two months before we even started toying with the idea of becoming boyfriends. He told me that intercourse was something that was very important to him and it was not something he could rush into. I told him that I was willing to wait because he was worth it

After seven months, and my running club. I planed trips and adventures, cooked and cleaned for him, watched his cat when he went out of town (which was quite frequently). I did everything I could to share my life with him and after seven months, I feel like he wouldn't open up, he wouldn't let me in, he wouldn't put out

I feel like my depression cost me my relationship. I am completely heartbroken and I am still completely in love with him.

The funny thing is, he opens it and I grab him. I kiss him deeper and more passionately than I ever have before. I pick him up, carry him into the bedroom and show him how wonderful my love is and how wonderful it can feel.

He is the last thing I think about before sleep and the first thing I think about when I wake.

Jake's told me a few times now that when he's gotten home, because of me. I just feel awkward about the whole situation. The last night we hung out, Erin called Jake and told him he was a huge wreck and he needed him, so Jake had to take off. 

Jake's said multiple times that Erin has no right to feel or act the way he does, I told Jake he could invite Erin along, but Erin always just blew the invite off, saying he didn't want to be a third wheel.

My best friend for almost 5 years is gay. I am a straight girl. He is open, but usually avoids the ""gay talk"". If someone asks him ""are you gay?"" he usually responds with ""haha, what makes you think that?"" Instead of an outright ""no"" lie. I understand completely why he does this, as he is a very manly gay man and works in construction/industry, so being ""out"" usually results in some negative backlash. It would be hard to know he was gay unless you knew him and had a good ""intuition"" for it. This makes it very hard for him to meet people. He is attracted to manly men as well. Most of the time the people he is attracted to are straight. He persues them, maybe gets a few mixed signals, and then heartbreak. I have seen it happen many different times. He often tries to attribute it to him being undesirable or ugly. This is incredibly frustrating because that is not the case, and gay bars. People usually think we are together. I try my damnedest to get him to socialize and talk to people but he is a very shy/reserved person and has the ""well they wont like me anyways"" mentality. He wont go to bars without me. When people do meatgaze him, what the fuck. I have lowered my ""standards"" before and have met an incredible man because of it. Social media is out of the question. He is incredibly shy(wont make the first move).

I've been out to most of my friends for at least 4 years now and about a year to my family. I've had my first boyfriend for 5 months (which is now my ex since about 4 months) to whom I've lost my «virginity»

I'm kinda interested in more chubby and hairy guys, I'm kind of ashamed of this preference I have, further more, I also have some serious sexual problems. I'm really shy and uptight about sex, I do not like to talk about it. Even thought I have sexual urges, like anybody else, I find the actual act of sex pretty animalistic and primitive. I feel bad about having sex with anybody and I fear that I can't find someone who will respect the fact that I don't wanna have sex on the first few dates. I do masturbate to porn

I do wanna find a husband one day and solve those problems, which is not what I'm looking for at all. I know some people are gonna tell me to use dating website, but I kinda find it weird for a relationship at 21 yo and I'm afraid people will find my account.

Fast forward a year, because i really had started to like him and i knew he felt something for me. We woke up the next day and he said he didn't remember a thing, and didn't say anything to me about it. I decided to move on and just chalk it up to him being a confused closeted guy who just did what he wanted and hooked up with whomever he felt like. a month later we hung out again, and ended up fucking two more times over that weekend, which at the end i was just so confused about and just got uncomfortable with. same story, he ""didn't remember"" those nights, and by this point i was *done*.

So, can't remember which. I was extremely displeased. However I had realized that we had never discussed this kind of thing. I pretended to try and open one or two jokingly and he very firmly refused to let me. That made me angry, but again we never discussed it. So I decided to- instead of making an issue of it-to tell him that I wasn't comfortable with him having those apps or using them and that i really didnt like it. He agreed that we had never discussed it but that it was fair of me to tell him, so he deleted them all and the issue was left alone. 

Yesterday night while I was leaving his car I noticed that again he had OKcupid and another app. I was leaving and I didn't want to argue or say anything on my way out. But I'm extremely unhappy. I feel that at the very least he ignored my feelings on the matter-as a matter of fact it really hurts me. And obviously I can't help wondering what he's saying with these men, if he doesn't think we'll last and he's simply planning ahead. 
He told me those apps where just there and they didn't mean anything

I've always shown signs of being different

My earliest sexual fantasies were of other boys my age when I hit puberty,"" but I don't remember the context. I went to my computer to Google the meaning of that word, and what happens when you Google ""porn"" happened. Safesearch can't block an outright adult word and still give results. I got into porn young, but would make myself look at straight porn only, still trying to convince myself I'm straight. (After a while, I stumbled on vclart.net, a really old and now unpopular furry site, but that's another issue altogether). I could not feel orgasm at all when masturbating. Everything mechanically worked, and it didn't affect me when I accidentally did it at 9 because I didn't understand why it felt good and didn't associate it with sex.

In freshman year of high school, but when he opened up to having a crush on me, I immediately lied that I was straight, flipped out at him, and broke his heart. From the burning internal conflict I was ignoring, one day I would be friendly, and the next I would throw names at them,"" and not caring who sees me pick on them. Looking back, and even ended up having my first of several panic attacks while in school. Lying to yourself like this is dangerous. Since I didn't ever speak of this with anyone

I've been in two failed relationships, I still denied being gay after having sex with her and being incredibly grossed out by it. We did this a couple times, and I silently dreaded it every time.

It got increasingly difficult to lie to myself now that I had a relationship with a girl which wasn't long distance. I distinctly remember the night when I stopped. It was 4 or 5 in the morning and I still couldn't sleep from my mind being so active. I was distraught to the point of being suicidal, cuddling close to me so I was little spoon. She didn't know I was thinking of suicide, but she managed to calm me down and her doing that made me think of everyone who relies on me and cares for me. I'm not sure if I would have gone through with it, but I credit her with saving my life.

At this point, I naturally have never had a boyfriend. I've had a bi-curious male ""friend with benefits"" and two guys I had one night stands with, but no actual relationships. I'm 22 now and I've both given up and created a self-fulfilling prophecy by switching to night shift and stopping my searching for a nice guy, focusing completely on work.

I think part of the reason I wanted to be straight is because of my dad but I'm not sure. I've also still not confronted him about it and he still thinks I'm dating the second girlfriend. Part of me still hates the idea of being gay. I switch back and forth daily between feeling okay and hating myself. I can't even explain why I feel this way. I'm not religious, ashamed of myself. My anger issues, panic attacks, and inability to orgasm were gone almost as soon as I accepted the truth, but something is still eating me.",,False,t5_2vgfw,True

My mom told me that both my brother and sister told her they won’t tell their friends, and my sister asked my mom to ask me not to tell anyone. 

This is a list of some of the things they have said that I really need your advice on how to respond to. I thought most of my responses to them were good but my mom has told me I don't seem to be trying to answer their questions

* HOW DO YOU KNOW? I really don’t know how to put words to this one.
* Do you think you can change?
* People will tell you to your face that they are ok with it, ostracized. 
* You won’t be as successful in your career. (Point to Tim Cook, so that may help) but do you guys know of any more? That's the best I could find on Google)
* Why is it important to you to tell people? 
* Why is your sexuality anyone’s business? I don’t go around telling people I’m heterosexual. (To which I have LOTS of examples of how
* Why haven’t you tried to at least have a relationship with a girl?
* How can you be sure if you haven’t had a relationship with a guy?
* You just expect us to blindly accept that this is true. You won’t even try to accept that maybe it’s not.
* Is this just something that you are deciding because you are unhappy? Because you haven’t found the right girl yet?
* You say that it’s important to you to share this because it will make you happy. So you’re saying that your whole life until now you have been unhappy?

The bro is not that fortunate, he might be a 5 or 6 in everyone else's book but he's perfect to me... hes my exact type and he turns me on like crazy. Hes very confident in himself, just doesnt like the way he looks and wants to improve his skinny body. He doesnt have self esteem issues, but the fact that Im better looking, makes him question everyone I hang out with.

A a month ago, which I totally understand but the ""cant trust"" part enrages me. He always been dropping these little hints about me sleeping around since we started dating and lately hes been very passive aggressive about it even though we confirmed several times that we are exclusive. 

I do care a lot for him and I go out of my way to make him happy, he dislikes every single one of them. He hates the scene, he doesnt go out with me. A lot of times we just go out with our own friends.

So, more set financially, have a career, and have been out longer, more dating experience. He just came out in December and is still finding his way. I’ve found myself attracted to him and we’ve hooked up 5 or so times, done a couple sleepovers. We’ve had great chemistry, fun sex. 

This past week I asked if he wanted to do another trip to the mountains and he said he’d love to. Shortly thereafter he replied and told me he’s been chatting with a guy from OKCupid and is excited about him, and that it was refreshing to meet me, and he and I will be great camping buddies. I told him I was a bit conflicted about things too (could it even work?), but that I really enjoy his company and feel some good chemistry. I was disappointed.

Anyway, but thought what the hell. Had a good time chatting and hanging out till bed. This is where things get hazy…. I’m not the best sleeper especially in tents and brought an Ambien to knock me down. I’ve taken it with a few drinks before (I know that’s bad), but maybe never when I’m drunk. I needed sleep and he passes out immediately. I recall looking at him thinking “I want sex”, but he wanted to sleep. 

At some point the alcohol/Ambien combo took over my brain and I don’t remember anything until I woke up. In the morning, sometime in the night I woke him up, started kissing him, ripped down his briefs, and sucked his dick. I said all sorts of dirty things about trying to get him to cum, etc. I even climbed on top of him and said I was gonna fuck his ass. He said for a few minutes my cock was actually inside him. He said he kissed me for a bit, but would try to rollover and show he wanted to sleep. He didn’t say if he ever said “no” or anything explicit

The next day he teased me a bit and seems to have a good sense of humor about it (Brokeback/Bareback Mountain jokes, but we’ve had sex before and it was pretty good. 

How would you guys handle this? I’ve apologized, wants to see me. I know part of this is I’m disappointed he doesn’t want to date, but I also will be happy to have him as a friend especially since so few gay dudes like this outdoors stuff. I keep ruminating on this and feeling bad. Shame spiral big time. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

TL;DR: Went camping with friend

When I am at a gay bar or a club, try to get someone's eye contact. Whenever I do this, it seems quite eerily like everyone is actively avoiding my eye contact. (Is that normal, or is that just me?) My type is more an active guy with certain ""bro-ish"" like characteristics but guys with some of the stereotypical mannerisms of gay men do not turn me off.

So I ended up getting crazy drunk (not my finest night) with a couple friends and at a bar ran into one of my gay friends who is openly out. He knows about me but I'm not out to everyone yet. We ended up getting food after the bars closed and holding hands and walked back to my place where he stayed the night. He really wanted to fuck but I didn't want to

Now it's morning, but the first time in almost 6 months. The other two times I didn't feel as guilty about it as this. I was almost proud of myself for stepping out of my comfort zone back then and really trying something new out. But now it's like, I get a whiff of his BO or see my pants on the floor and it makes my stomach upset. 

Maybe it's because this time was at my place so I can't escape it? Or that I knew him before as just friends? Or I'm worried it will be awkward when we see each other again? 

Does anyone have any advice on how to get over this feeling? I hate feeling like this, guilty, like I can't believe I just did that.

I started dating this guy about a month ago. Over the course of this month, it's clear we really like each other. We've made major efforts (and late LATE night trips) to spend what little time we can while his schedule is hectic.

With the last guy I dated, basically always on edge and over sensitive. For whatever reason, that didn't happen with this guy and I had hoped that maybe last time it was because it was my first real relationship, and now that I've done that I'm more relaxed.

Nope. It all hit me full force yesterday. Suddenly I was over analyzing every text he sent, as opposed to fucking fantastic which it has always been. I never vocalize any of it, I internalize it all and silently scream all night as my inner anxiety monster chips away at my practiced smile. It's the same thing all ever again. Just like the early days of my last relationship, he asks me ""What's wrong,""  and I smile and say ""Nothing!"" And we go back to cuddling. Meanwhile, my brain is working overtime.

I know I should probably say something but I just don't want to. I really like this guy and I don't want to dump all the crazy on him so soon and scare him off. I want to be sure I've hooked him before I reveal the crazy

Oh, and he's a 22 year old Greek god with a lithe, statuesque body, a six pack, and is incredibly attractive. Confidence oozes from him, in that ""I used to give many shits, but it was detrimental to my health

I just want to be able to enjoy this, and now I'm scared that my brain is going to fuck it up, which makes the anxiety worse. It's like not being able to fall asleep and being angry at yourself for not being able to fall asleep, which keeps you up longer.

What in fuck's name can I do here? I want to just date this guy without wondering whether or not he actually likes me or not.

When he flew back from his trip the next Friday, went out for a little bit, came back to his house and hooked up. The next morning he made me brunch. We hung out all day. He had friends visiting that night, so I said I had dinner plans.  Later he texted me to meet up and we all hung out. We went back to his place and we crashed in the same bed together even after this girl was trying to get him to sleep with her (she tried hard enough where she walked into the room we were in and tried to convince him that the other bed-which was his own bed-was more comfortable...wtf?). I'm glad he stayed in the room with me bc I would not have been happy regardless if we werent hooking up and just sleeping.

The next day he invited me to a baseball game with one of his best friends. Then he went on a business trip again and we facetimed one night for like an hour while planning a getaway for this past weekend.

I, however, confused as all hell, both of which I seem to be pretty good at. add to that that my dick hasn't changed size since I was 9 years old

I messaged him on Facebook later apologizing for the bad sex. I told him I felt like shit. he assured me that it was fine, he's still texting me. that's good. I didn't completely turn him off. fast forward a couple of days and we're on our fourth date. we're starting to get to know each other better. conversation is easier. cuddling feels more natural. later on, we start making out. its better this time. more intimate, more enjoyable. but then I remember, ""oh shit, we have to fuck now."" same problem with the condoms. I mention my size to him this time, apologize for not being larger. he says its fine

this time, Mr boner decides to leave us, and I'm left with a limp dick again. keep in mind, he doesn't know I've never been in anyone, and vice versa, and I advertised myself as a vers top. so, naturally, and while I've always been open to the possibility of getting fucked, but suffice to say he only got halfway in me. and the night ended same as before. he came from jacking off. I didn't even bother. I almost feel like I didn't deserve to come for being so bad at this sex thing.

So I have been contemplating this situation for a while and I thought I would throw it your way to hear some of your opinions on the matter seeing that the thought of it keeps floating around my head anyway.

I'm 23 and there is this guy(henceforth Zack) who I have known for about four years. Six months ago I found out that Zack identifies as bisexual.  He is the type that is very flirty and he has always flirted with me both privately and publicly, get a rise out of people* style.  Now I'm pretty sure he is into me(he has even sent me a nude picture of himself in a crazy pose holding something in front of his package, when he texts he calls me ""qt"" etc.) but he doesn't know outright that I am gay (neither do most of my friends for that matter[im telling my good friends next week{that's another story}]) although I assume he is suspicious and he continues to flirt and feel the situation out.

So Zack is one devilishly handsome, dirty blond scruffy haired mother fucker and me thinks he wants to bang!  I am pretty partial to the idea of sleeping with him myself ;-) and I even had a sex dream about him last night.  He is pretty sexually open and kinky(I know from stories he has shared) he sometimes talks about how he is perpetually horny and I know he would be wild and all around pretty fun in bed(hes got a pretty sizable dick too) but here is the issue.

1) Zack has been known to have a big mouth and share peoples personal business with anyone who will listen.  Being that we have mutual friends I am concerned that he would out me to them before I have a chance to do so on my own terms

2) Zack doesn't really have any close friends and two mutual friends of ours confided in me that in their opinion he didn't exactly have an easy childhood and he doesn't know how to be real with people on some levels.  He is very smart(we have great intellectual debates that I cant have with many other people) but I think he still feels inadequate in some ways and he try's to compensate by being crass and pretending not to give a fuck about anyone or anything in a sort of nihilistic fashion(which, one of my friends is even of the opinion that Zack is somewhat of a sociopath.  In my opinion, however, I think he just needs some good friends who steer him in the right direction and don't just have him around for the entertainment value of cheep laughs.  I am by no means looking for a serious relationship with this guy and I am not trying to be his 'Dr. Phil' these are just my observations of the situation and I think that by staying platonic friends we could both benefit (we would be each others only LGBT friends/wingmen and he could benefit from a close friend who isn't a douche)  and by sleeping together we might mess up the friendship. But a friends with benefits situation would be the optimal outcome I suppose ;-) 

At first I had told myself that I wouldn't sleep with Zack despite my being attracted to him

I decided that at my birthday celebration I'm going to try flirting a little more to test the waters and see if he's interested, but the suspense is killing me.

Due to my upbringing and time in the military, and that's the only experience I had with guys until recently. I felt myself actually being attracted to them in those situations, and it was so much better for me than anything I've done with women.

Now that I'm getting out of the military soon, and talking to  a few friends of mine, I'm thinking I may be gay. 

tl;dr So my problem is, but I've had no problem having sex with women. I'm worried now that I'm coming out that I may be hiding behind the possibility of being bi, rather than just coming out as gay.

I'm 24, worked hard, had a part-time job and managed to keep a social life and romantic life on the go too. I was always so passionate about my field and science in general.

Halfway through the PhD I feel like I've hit a wall. Its not as if things are going as bad as they could be (though results aren't great lately). I just feel a bit indifferent towards it all. I find it hard to go to work and get the job done

Worse still I think I can feel this creeping into other parts of my life. I still socialise and see my boyfriend frequently but have started to do it a bit grudgingly.

So now that I have found out about my good friend's HIV status I start to think about everything he has told me in the past - about all of his prior sexual partners he's bragged about. There's this hairstylist who his good friends with our group of friends that Kiven has bragged about having bareback sex with as a hookup. I didn't think anything of it at the time because I didn't know his status. I assumed the hairstylist was positive as well because why would they have bareback sex

So not long, I don't know if I was drunk, I don't think I was *that* drunk honestly, but I asked him - ""was it because of his status?"" Kiven's boyfriend is known as a worry-wort about STDs. It is revealed that after 6 months of dating and having sex, Kiven had not told his boyfriend about his HIV status. I basically outed someone's boyfriend to them.


I feel like I definitely crossed the line and it was not my place to tell Kiven's ex-boyfriend about his HIV status. I love my friend Kiven, and I look up to him. Kiven has been calling and texting me, he knows what happened because his ex told him last night about everything I said - so we, Kiven and I, need to have a conversation. What I need help with is how to approach this conversation. I feel like I did wrong but then another part of me felt there was an ethical component to what I did. For me personally, I would hate it if someone slept with me willingly withholding their HIV status. I know I shouldn't care about other people's relationships but I feel at unease when my good friend is always making jokes and always bringing up his hookups and sexual conquests. One of my friends suggested I just blame last night's admission on the alcohol. I wasn't trying to maliciously harm my friend Kiven or ruin any relationships I was just seriously concerned. I don't think Kiven will see that though.



How should I approach this conversation? What should I do? I still want to be Kevin's friend.

So I'm currently going through some major changes in my life right now.  I'm getting out of a relationship

All in all

Moving back to Canada makes sense to me.  Not for the reason there is another guy there (will discuss this later).  But it's cheaper for me to live, since I'm not allowed to make any money as a student in the States.   With my overall goal of being able to be self-sufficient, this is what it seems like I need to do.

Now, he was coming into the city and we finally met.

Our time together was brief. He had to go somewhere with his friend.  But the time we had together was amazing.  Furthermore, sadly. But we said we'd meet again.  Fast forward to May!

I had to fly back up to Canada to get business shit done.  So I met with G a few times.  There was nothing sexual (as in intercourse: oral or anal).  There was kissing and cuddling. That was it. 

 Anyhow, it was solidified that my feelings for him were much more than I anticipated.  

G and I had a talk about our situation.  We both concluded now that it is best to be friends for the time being.  Due to my situation of not sure where I will be and ending a relationship.  And his situation: he has been burned before he says, a year we will explore our feelings for each other.

The part that kills me though, he told me he has been single for 3 years and he can't wait.  It's also weird for me, that I have to ""battle"" for a relationship.  My past two boyfriends where all about ""you like me.  I like you.  Let's get together!""

My biggest fear and that I may not get to explore my feelings for him and he may find some other guy.  Thinking about this upsets me somewhat. But I concluded what G and I have is something we can't rush

So yeah

We are both 23 and he is my first relationship (and first dude I have even kissed) whereas he has had 2 boyfriends, and that I was his first as well.

So, with the odd urge to top once in a blue moon, but would always attempt it when he was keen because I wanted him to experience bottoming.

So about a month or two ago I topped him. I couldn't cum but he eventually did. Usually we would have a laugh, but this time he seemed a little distant and went straight to sleep. I figured he must have been tired and what not so I thought nothing of it.

For the next two weeks he became kind of distant, but I just figured maybe he wanted some time with his friends, so left him be for a little bit. After not seeing each other for over a week (little weird for us) he said he would pop around my place if he had time after work, to which I replied 'no problem, can crash at mine too'. He came around for like 40 minutes, and ended up going home. We had dinner a couple of days later and watched a movie in my room where he stayed. I started kissing him, things got a little heavier, he was rock hard and drooling precum. He didn't engage any type of anal

After that I didn't see him for a week again. It was his birthday so I took him out for dinner. We end up back at his watching a movie, I keep doing it, then he gets kind of angry so I stop. We kiss innocently and cuddle for a bit, and I am stroking his neck. He tells me to stop again, kind of forcefully. It all seems a little weird so I ask him if everything is alright. He replies yeah, everything is fine then puts his arm around me and he goes to sleep. 

I had to leave in quite abruptly in the middle of the night due to family stuff. He was really helpful the next couple of days, offering for me to stay at his if need be, call anytime I needed to talk. I met up with him mid week and explained why I left in the middle of the night, made sure it had nothing to do with him, and then asked if there was anything on his mind. He said that he really didn't enjoy bottoming, like not at all. He didn't want to say it, because he thought it would be a boring sex life for me if I couldn't top him, and we decided that I would be the bottom

I figured this might have solved all the affection, shuffling around and said 'ah i've got to cook some wings for your party tomorrow... (long pause)... oh and wash my bike'. I figured he would jump at the chance to have sex after this really honest conversation, and that the excuse he gave was pretty damn lame. 

I message him saturday morning asking if he could bring some stuff for the party, but instead we kiss for a bit and we go to bed. 

Last night we go to the movies, hold my hand, or anything the entire night and I kiss him goodnight and he goes on his way home. 

Now what I have said here might seem extremely high school and stupid to you guys, I have honestly felt like we are nothing more than friends, because if we are hanging out, we have a laugh and have fun. I know sex and affection and intimate type behaviour is going to drop off a little bit after 8 months or so, but surely it shouldn't be like this with two dudes in their early twenties. It can't be an attraction thing, as when I do initiate and he partakes, he is rock hard and oozing pre-cum. Also, I have been told I am a pretty attractive guy. Is it simply a case of him just not that being into me anymore

My mom threatened me [infront of him] to send me to jail without having any proof at all of our having a sexual relationship. He said the same thing, I've thought about it many many times. But I cannot overcome the feelings he gave me plus my history and his history is very very close to me. The history is layered very deep, I fear recalling the happy moments, I want to recall them but I fear the worst.

I'm a type who CANNOT leave. Why? Because in my childhood my parents fought a lot. And I promised myself I'd never do that! But somehow

My gay boyfriend went away to study in Germany and then UK. I had no previous sexual experience. And neither I ever wish to make any after him. [The emotions I went through were enough to make me a commit for life.]

Now it has been two years. He says

Now, ""I don't need you any more"" and very sad stuff like that.

I just know that I will NEVER and WILL NOT want to have any relationship other than him in my LIFE.

My gay boyfriend was abused as a child for over 2 years by an older guy. I

I've so much common with my BABY! And I so much want him. And I know this FEELING inside me will never end and I cry day and night!

And the country I live in

He is very very very emotional. I'm very very very emotional too. And he keeps on disconnecting the call and sometimes for weeks he doesn't even let me contact him by any means.

I've allowed him to have as much fun as he wants. ""Just don't leave me"". But it seems
I've no urge to continue living by the way. And this break up has continued at a time when I'm doing my research work (humanities) and I've not written a single word for more than a month now.

Breakup occurred because I didn't visit him in Berlin and now he is London where he is living with his family. I was studying that's why I couldn't visit him and he was studying as well. 

And basically we needed money to apply and we couldn't ask from our parents. Everything according to his standards should never be known. 

It's just sad. I'm not a person who'd hide anything from my family. And because of this situation

I'm currently 24, and never been in a relationship; I've always known I was gay since I was 13 years old. I'm still not out to family and most friends. For most of my life I've been super focused on academics and extracurriculars; volunteering, graduating at the top of my high school class, sports, etc. I had the opportunity to attend a great university majoring in engineering. It basically took up my entire life, so I didn't have much time for socializing and at least having the gay experience/awakening at college. Again, I was focused on academics and a little naive to what was out there.

I had no idea about a gay community until my senior year when I became close friends with a guy I was interning with. We talked everything and sexuality naturally came up. I suspected he was gay, which opened up a place I never knew existed in society. I experimented very little, but it was still an eye-opening thing for me.

Fast forward a year, so I went out to Houston on the weekends, but it's just not the same as having a network or community nearby. Whenever I was out in Houston, I never really got much attention at bars or on any apps, got rejected, but I kind of shrugged it off at first. I'm seriously lonely, stressed, but the environment I worked in was very toxic and homophobic and it came from people I depended on learning from. I never really said anything about it but it cut me even more deeply. I start looking up opportunities

Bottom line is that I'm having a lot of trouble meeting decent looking, I'd consider myself to be a good catch. I'm young, have a good job and stable income, driven to do better in life, stay active and workout regularly, and consider myself to be good-looking. I'm blessed to have had the opportunities and to be in great health and sound mind, but it's not comforting in my loneliness. 

I'm not limiting myself to any race and only prefer masculine guys. A relationship would be idea, or even a hookup would be great. I'm just having no luck with any of them. I know Grindr and other apps aren't the best ways to look for guys, but even tonight when I went out, there was this air of pretentiousness among the guys at multiple bars/clubs that I wasn't good enough. I joined serious dating website; no luck with that either.  

I'm afraid that I made the wrong decision to move up here, are most black guys not considered to be attractive (or the preference of choice) by other races? Am I wrong in my reasoning that my relationship and friendship options are severely limited due to the lack of black guys in the gay community and how we are looked at by others in the community? I have so many thoughts going through my head that I hope I was able to organize the, Honest answers appreciated.

Looking for some advice on a situation that a lot of us have seemed to struggle with: 

In a rough patch with my boy and wondering what's the right balance between sharing feelings vs. playing it cool? For me specifically (if you want to see background below)

I've been ""seeing"" a fellow bro since last fall. We never gave it official labels, movie nights, some dinners, etc. We've met each other's friends, and both of us said we don't like the thought of each other getting with anyone else. 

Now we seem to have hit a rough patch and haven't gotten together in a couple weeks and our typical back-and-forth texting has also dropped way down. 

I'm not oblivious to the signs... But I've asked him a couple times and he's said everything is fine and there's nothing to worry about. Just bad timing and a tough schedule. So now I'm torn. 

Do I choose to believe him and back off a bit? Play it cool and give it some space to see if the situation improves? Even at the risk (if we're drifting apart) of losing a last chance to tell him how much I like him and try to make it right? 

Or do I lay it all out? Tell him how much I like him and that I want him in my life regularly

Anyone have experiences like this? Is there any way to balance the two?  To lay out some feelings

This bro is torn and confused by the whole situation, or lessons from similar experiences. ",,False,,t5_2vgfw,False,,

But I'm getting antsy to move

The most common piece of advice given around here is to move to a bigger, and giving that advice to others. But do I consider reasons other than a shitty dating scene? Here's my pros and cons...

Pros:

* My parents are still alive (and only in their early 50s), and I have a great relationship with them. They don't plan on moving.
* I have many friends (most of them straight)
* I have a steady, Mon-Fri, 8-4, my paid vacation and sick leave are two separate pools, I'm in the NY State pension system (which recently froze off for new employees), and my boss doesn't care how long my lunch breaks go, and I don't have to clock in or out. I'm even unionized.
* Albany is *very* convenient. We have three highways that circle the city, and be anywhere else in the city with 10 minutes. No crazy driving or traffic like DC, SF, and other places. It's like NYC Jr as far as grid-like roads, but with the bonus of highways circling the city.
* Albany has a ton of great places to eat. A lot of NYC people, move here for the cheaper cost of living and bring their big city cooking skills and open up great restaurants.
* It's a short, I'm in one of those big 3 awesome cities that's 100x better than Albany but without having to deal with their cost of living.
* Flights out of Albany International Airport are relatively cheap, which has non-stops between it and Albany.

Cons

* The dating scene sucks.
* The snow also sucks.

So... what do you think? Is shitty dating scene enough of a reason to move when the rest of my living situation is... alright?

Tuesday morning, but he had to cancel. I wasn't surprised, and told him it was ok. He kept saying he felt really bad, and I told him I understood, but that if he ever wanted to try again, he should hit me up.

I found out later that he had injured himself on Monday

Now, so I don't know how to ask him that. This isn't something I'd avoid him over (the same thing happened before with someone else, and now we're great friends), but I don't want to hold out hope that a date will happen when it won't.

So, but when it comes to anal sex I've been having some ""issues"". I've heard some people say that anal sex is not for everyone, I honestly don't want to rule it out yet. When I watch it on porn it turns me on, and when I simulate it and pretend to do it while rolling around in bed with a guy it turns me on. 
But when I get down to doing the actual thing I've got a lot of improvement to do...

I've tried to top twice and I honestly can't get hard

I've bottomed three times, he did. I figured, since it was the first time it would feel uncomfortable, and that was just normal. 

Recently, those are my favorite because I feel the most comfortable, but I have yet to feel any pleasure per say. I guess I like the fact that he enjoys it, that makes me feel good, but I don't get a feeling of pleasure from the penetration. Instead, and I hope I'm not the only one who's experienced this...when I'm getting fucked (and especially when he thrusts at a faster pace) I get the sensation that I'm going to basically shit...it's really weird, uncomfortable and nerve-racking...so much so that I ask him to slow down not so much cause it hurts but because of this sensation and it worries me about when might happen.

We got out the door and had a bottle of water with us that we were told we couldn't bring outside. So we went back in to finish our water. When we got back in, my boyfriend said ""good, maybe I can go talk to that guy now."" This set me off. I told him sure, but this time he did. So after he walked off

But...I wasn't really pissed that he was going to talk to the guy, but I've just never had anybody pick me up before, and [I think I'm a pretty decent looking guy](http://i.imgur.com/8MEQ9Y8.jpg). He's taken and he still gets them left and right. It's just not fair.

Earlier, they probably weren't paying attention to the music, and I could hear most of what was going on.

I guess I was just a little peeved that they knew I was leaving in less than an hour to go skiing for the rest of the day, and could STILL hear her moaning.

My roommate and I complain about the people who have loud sex above us

Do any of you talk to your roommates about this kind of stuff


TL;DR Roommate didn't wait to get jiggy with his loud girlfriend when they both knew I would be leaving the apartment in an hour. I don't much like listening females moaning in the throes of passion. I'd prefer not to talk about him sexing up his girlfriend, and not so awkward.

Am I wrong for finding it a bit rude that they can't wait just a few minutes for me to leave? And should I talk to him about it

Thanks!

It's not the first time.

I started university in September 2012, find myself and truly discover who I am as a person. Maybe even meet a guy to be with if that's not so much to want.

I was very nervous though moving to university, in my eyes, a bore.

I was so crippled with nerves I was afraid to be myself in a way

I've never really had a gay friend, I don't have anyone I can just talk to about, to talk about guys I like and sex. It's tiring being a novelty for people, sure I can have a laugh about it but when I say ""Ah I hooked up with this guy last night"" and the first reaction from a friend is ""Ew"" it's not the most pleasant. It's not that they're homophobic or intolerant as bad as it may sound, but I think it's because they don't know how to react to it. On the other side, I've always been a bit self-depricating, one because it is a sense of humour and mockery

So I was plodding through university

Now, suffering excessively from anxiety and trying to second guess the comments of people and subtext that may or may not have been there.

I had lost myself.


Come Christmas

Although I never attempted suicide

I felt like I hit rock bottom

I couldn't even make it to university. I'd never be able to sleep and come dawn I'd sleep to wake up in the middle of the afternoon

Although I somehow passed my assessed work (trust me, you haven't really met me yet."" A self from the past filled with optimism and happiness, someone who could take a joke whether an awful pun or a dark joke. I believed that being with my family I could make it back to my sarcastic and friendly former, unfortunately that wasn't the case.

One evening I remember trying to talk about this with my mum, ranging from physical, emotional, social and financial. I said I wanted to see someone, thinking that I might have been suffering from depression. She replied with ""Well if you think you are a burden, how much do you think seeing someone to talk to would cost?""

I cried all night without a wink of sleep that night, stop being such a child.""

Then

I wasn't able to find work in Australia so I went home to live with my dad

I should have said before

I returned home and lucked out with a job to start trying to fend for myself. However coming back to find my dad in a bedsit I feel almost obliged to help him. Now, there never has been and unfortunately that's still there. We just can't speak to each other.

Since being home I feel the need to help him financially even though I am a student in debt. I feel like sometimes I care too much

I go back next month to university, I feel like I just can't contribute to any conversation whether serious or jovial. I don't know what's wrong with me and I don't know how to fix it. 

I'm really lost at the moment. Any advice or even understanding would be greatly appreciated. I just don't know how to go about day to day business anymore.

My father always tried to back it up with psychological ""facts"" and origins of homosexuality. Stats and what not. According to what he tells my sister now

My mother was more adamant about her hatred. She bonded once with her friend about how disgusting lesbians were. Every time I acquired a male friend her response was ""Well is he Gay? You shouldn't be friends with him if he is."" She told me I was making worse decisions than my sister at my age. My sister, and had an abortion at one point.

Like I rarely ever ever get hard/horny at all ever - this makes me really worried because I don't wanna lose my sexuality, I can look at dudes and say ""oh yeah he's attractive, etc"" but it feels very different, almost as if I have no REAL sexual desire....I also think I suffer a bit of death grip from when I masturbate.

1371414567.0,1gh0wk,Time to come out to the 'rents?,edugeek,13,3,8,"So here's my thing.  There's a bunch of issues for me to untangle

First, and just recently coming to terms with my sexuality (within the last few years).  I'm just now moving back to my hometown to take a new job after seven years living in the middle of nowhere farm country.  I've got pretty high walls - I'm a bit of a loner, and probably kept it that way intentionally to avoid being outed, etc.  Eventually, it just kind of became habit.

While I'm working on my social life (slowly but surely)

So, who is three years younger than me, is already done with all of these things).  She's pressuring me to meet people and meet girls, but the problem is, obviously, that I don't want to.  I'd love to get out there and meet guys, and I'm trying to, and that's an issue for another thread.  Also, and would probably react in anger.  I had a friend growing up who ended up being gay, and weird

I had planned to tell them this year, I'm not really sure what to do.  The combination of lying (and fighting - because my singleness is the cause of many-a-fights in my home), and my otherwise social awkwardness is manifesting itself physically - I'm becoming depressed, lethargic, otherwise sickly.  A change needs to happen, but I'm not sure how.

I'm financially stable enough that I could afford to live in a lower-end apartment or share an apartment with someone if I had to while I waited for the sale of my house.  But it would tighten things for a while

1371361062.0,1gfw1o,I've been single for four years without so much as a date. Can someone please talk to me?,Fraxin,14,0,24,"I'm 23. 

Four years ago, I realize he was a decent guy who could be a bit of a jerk sometimes, but either way I fell for him hard. The relationship was never amazing after our honeymoon phase, and it didn't work out. The first year or so after, I thought I lost the best guy in the world, until my current understanding set in.

My heart's completely walled off now. The thought of dating triggers severe panic attacks. i let someone in, and after two weeks I told him we couldn't interact anymore... because I would lay in bed crying at the thought of having to hang out with him or log on to Facebook and see a message from him. A year ago, I found a fuckbuddy. We fucked three times, no strings attached, and after each time, I walked around outside alone, for an hour

The thought of dating makes me cry, I work on and solve alone. I'm very very successful in other aspects of life, because I'm spending NO time on romance. I don't want to be alone, but I'm not in any place to go look for a guy now because I will be keeping one eye on the nearest door so I can run away from him on a moment's notice.

A bit about me: I am 22 years old, and while I would hopefully say I’m attractive enough, you won’t be seeing me modelling on any magazine cover or billboard. I like to consider myself intelligent, I love reading, discussing and debating (arguing). I am very outspoken and opinionated. I love architecture and urban planning. I’m bilingual English-French, but I’ve learned Italian (my dad’s family is Italian) and as I enjoy language (I used to be crazy about them) I used to try to learn new ones all the time, like Japanese, Korean or German (there were others but you get the gist). I consider myself simple, I love to attempt cooking. :P I would like to say I enjoy travel, but I’m starting to go to the gym because I want to get in shape and be healthy (I’m not big

I’m sort of trying to start my life over (or so it feels like). I want to study architecture in school, urban planning, design, construction. I intend to speak to professors and departments in colleges and universities. I am now a member of my neighbourhood’s zoning committee (we’re almost downtown, and are seeing an influx of highrise development, so we try to make sure that the neighbourhood benefits properly). I hope to work in construction sometime next year so I learn about construction methods and materials for architecture school. I’m trying to do things that are more adventurous and not what I would normally do (I’m going to do [Edgewalk]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KkK35y8MAA) next week, and one day I want to bungee jump, and climb Mount Fuji

I came out at a very early age: 11; and from middle school all throughout high school I was active in my city’s queer community, despite being an active member, no one ever seemed to want to be interested in me romantically (or few people were explicit). 

There was an LGBTTQ youth group in my city that I would attend every so often, and made great friends. I would either sit in the lounge or kitchen area, and talk to whomever else would stay out there, usually a group of people that would eventually leave and do something else downtown. Now, this youth group was never a dating service, but you would often see people from the meetings have sex or start dating, and then eventually some new guy or girl would join and they’d be “off the market” shortly after. 

As my city is small, that they were truly nonchalant about it. I really wanted to have a boyfriend or even have sex, but it never happened for me. I felt like I was ugly, as though I was undesirable, that the only thing people could want from me is to be friends. And while having friends is never a bad thing, I wanted something more. I wanted someone who liked me; who found me to be attractive enough; fun enough; want to spend time with me; and despite all my faults, someone who thought I was special and worth it. 

I dated 3 guys when I was in high school, as he was just in the process of coming out and he should have been given some space to explore his sexuality, rather than enter into a closed, monogamous relationship with someone who had been out for a long time. The second one was incredibly superficial (and not very bright), and he broke up with me because he did find me attractive any more and grew bored of me. It was hard dating him because he lived in foster care without a phone or computer, so I could hardly get in contact with him. The third suffered from depression, caused when he fell for his straight friend and could not get over him. He was a skater-bro, but you could definitely tell I was gay). He told me he normally didn’t like guys like me, as it’s something I have as well now, I was upfront about it. He thought I was a slut because of this

He was the last guy I ever dated

Fast forward a bit. I graduated high school that year and moved to Toronto to attend UofT. I was very proud of this achievement, as most of you know, and while I was there, I did not meet anyone (I met a guy in residence, but that’s a complicated issue that never came to fruition). I stopped being involved in the queer community, as I no longer felt it a welcoming environment because people were not always nice to me/ catty bitches, and I didn’t date or even have sex at all (I lived in res, and then transferred to McGill in Montreal. In the two years that I was there, so that didn’t really help me feel good. 

To deal with my celibacy, I wanted to spend time with someone. I wanted to love someone and even have sex with them. But not just sex – the most mind-blowing sex imaginable. The sort that no one would ever want to complain about, the sort that they would want to come back again and again for more because they actually enjoy it. The sort of sex that makes them proud and happy to be with me. It’s obviously a fantasy, as none of this is probably realistic, but I just want someone that I can make happy. I’m happy when I make other people happy.

Anyway

My friends tried introducing me to some guys they know, I fell into a deep depression that made me flunk out of school. It wasn’t because of him, but I just felt so incapable of continuing. I lost interest in my program, I wasn’t happy living in Montreal, I felt like I wasn’t smart or attractive. It seems like an overreaction to a simple rejection, but it wasn’t just a rejection for me. This was four years after high school, and the loneliness and undesirability that I felt when I was younger came back and made me realize that my life would not get better. People don’t see me as anything more than just a friend. And this pattern continues over and over and over again, but that I’m a “chill” guy they want to hang with. Just a few days ago

At this point, if that counts). But worst of all, I am single and celibate not by choice for far too long, and I want to find someone. At my age, I should be meeting lots of people, hooking up and dating, as I’m practically at my peak. I’ve not had a real/ long-term relationship and considering my sexual relations were few and subpar, and be really good. Looking for someone either through friends or online hasn’t worked for me, and while she allowed me to be raised atheist, but I'm at a point where I would like to have sex with one if I had a chance because I feel it would be easier to find then men and would relieve some of my pent-up sexual frustration. 

What do you think? What am I doing wrong that makes people see me as only a friend and nothing more? (I realize that you haven’t met me in person and this might be subjective). For someone who doesn’t like clubbing, date, and have sex like everyone else? How did you manage to meet your SO or past beaux?

But in all seriousness here is the situation and why I need some guidance.  
The backstory:  I have been with my bf for a year and a half.  We have a close relationship and (I think) great communication (for the most part).  We have had minor ups and downs.  And one MAJOR set-back.  Last summer we were having a great relationship.  Taking vacations, playing tennis, just all-in-all spending a lot of quality time together.  I was on the cusp of telling him I love him.  We were on top of a mountain having climbed it all day when he told me he loves me.  I didn't respond.  I didn't want to be cliche and say it back and make it seem less important.  So I didn't say it back.  A few days later we were hanging out the night before he was living town for the night.  The whole night it was on the tip of my tongue to say it to him.  Looking into his eyes repeatedly, looking away as I backed down from saying it.  He went away for the night without me saying it.  When he got back we met up that day.  I went to kiss him and noticed a hickey on his neck.  We were at a mall.  I walked away from him - my heart was pounding in my eyes and I couldn't focus.  I KNEW it was a hickey and it was making me immediately sick to my stomach.  Long story short, while away for the night he got drunk and had sex with some random friend of a friend.  He regretted it (or regretted getting caught) and after a lengthy and messy it we got through it.  But it was all him trying and me not wanting to see him.  Eventually he said he was scared because I had never told him I loved him back and he just wanted to feel something from someone else.  I think its an excuse and a cop-out to blame me for his cheating.  
Since then we have built our relationship back up.  Its been hard work.  How one 20 min action can have such a lasting impact  over so much quality time together seems ridiculous at times
Recently we've been watching porn together or making comment on hot guys and the idea of a threesome has come up.  We've both said how it would be hot to have one and what would be hot about
What is a genuine worry for me
Recently we had a heated argument and somehow or other a comment was made along the lines of me being with someone else and how he wouldn't appreciate that.  And his response was that he wouldn't be bothered if I cheated.  That one statement opened a can of worms and we discussed our views.  I told him I could never give him an open relationship and he said that he wouldn't want to be with anyone else
Now I think I'm pretty level headed and think things through and am open minded.  The idea of a threesome with him seems like it could be fun and we would both enjoy it (we've both had them in previous situations)
Has anyone experienced these situations before or have some insight or prospective that I might be missing?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 
Cheers

1367252634.0,1dcg2l,Was I just a guinea pig?,tgiords,15,2,11,"Hey guys

So I just got out of my first relationship (2 years) with a great guy
Anyway after 23 years of watching my straight friends find people, I live just north of NYC about 30-40 mins, and in the suberbs you have 2 kinds of guys, the obviously gay and flamboyant ones, and married/daddy men. I like fem boys its just that my dick wont get hard for them, I am by definition a vers btm and masc, so I have spent my life hoping to find someone, the term head over heals seems like a fraction of what i really felt for him, we dated for 2 years.
 
He was a strict top, he liked to hold the door for me, drive the car and do somewhat more manlier things although I am not fem I did gravitate to the more subordinate in the relationship. I am and was already much more comfortable with my ""outness"" than him (which I think is due to the liberal town and great group of guys i call my best friends) although he wasnt ""closeted"" he was still dealing and learning a ton about being himself. He always had said things like ""the beginning  to the rest of my life started with you"" ""we have the most amazing sex"" and we did, im talking passionate, sweaty just awesome sex where he was a top, he never had an issue getting hard and staying hard"" we would fall asleep in each others arms, it was exactly what I had been waiting for my whole life.

Ill get to the point - One day we are on the phone, and the trash had been completely wiped, there was things in there from craigslist and what not all dated 2010 - 2011 , not a big deal, till i realized he had forgotten to delete the sent folder.

what I found has destroyed me, he was a bottom, one guy wrote him and said ""I hope your not some little breakable boy, I am a bigger man in every way"" - he responded ""awesome see you at 330 in the sauna"" I even read one encounter where he got fucked by a guy, the email was dated FEB 15th the day after we spent the best day of my life together...a day called valentines day, that I have always hated, loathed even, i would forever get a card from my mom and some candy...until i met ryan and my whole outlook on valentines day changed

This KILLED ME, I stayed with him a couple more months, they were hard I started having night mares and we were fighting all the time not to mention more lies had surfaced. As of April 2013 I am single, Im devastated im never going to find someone, i will be alone for a good amount of time, and it just makes me think, can i be mad at him, can I be mad at someone who is still figuring it out?

Im really sorry for the length of this one guys, while he spent his days meeting up with dudes. Im broke, broken, and all around just unmotivated, depressed and questioning the entity of human life. he still begs me to come back... what do you guys think? Was I just a science experiment for him, his first dip into the man pond or what? can someone change? can someones fantasies be supressed? and more importantly - How can we really forgive if we cant forget?

1366505600.0,1crv8k,Ending Relationship - Anxiety Abound,lewistakesaction,12,0,3,"Hey guys

My first serious relationship of my adult life is slowly but surely ending before my eyes and I'm just anxious and looking for a bit of advice. Here's the background:

I'm 25, and he had an extensive history that co-workers had warned me about. But he seemed sweet enough, we hit it off, and made it happen. 

It became very serious, very well. He got a promotion, we lived a very happy life. 

About a year later I suddenly got the chance to move to the big city for my career. It was the only decision to make, I decided to move to the city, 1.5 hours away from him. We continued our relationship long distance, which was okay, but tough for a while.

Long distance became a major issue when the fall season kicked in because that started both of our seriously busy seasons. You see, and usually either 9am - 7/8pm or 4pm-10/11pm, and he works a over-booked M-F 9am-5pm (usually actually getting out at 7:30 or 8). 

Seeing each other was almost impossible. I'd go weeks without seeing him and never know when the next time we'd see each other was. We still stayed in CONSTANT contact through text message (like 12 year old girls) which was okay. And occasionally he'd pop down for a night or I'd go up for a night, and it was lovely.

Soon though, even though he wasn't around. I felt like I just wanted to go home to him, but this caused me to shut myself in constantly. It was an awful feeling. Soon I started to resent him popping in for an evening after I got off work. We'd get three hours with each other, and go to bed because he'd need to head back early, or I'd have to go to work early. I wanted more time than was possible. It only served to make me feel worse.

What was worse was we had no timeline. No ""In a year we'll be back together! For now

Then suddenly I befriended a co-worker who FORCED me to go out. She had seen me in this pit

That's when the feeling of wanting more hit me. It was like meeting these people had opened my eyes to the idea that there were more guys to meet. Here I was, with the ability to meet so many guys, and instead I was nursing an aching heart that was resting 1.5 hours away from me. I don't know what else I wanted, but I wanted more. I've dated one person in my adult life, him, where he's dated 4 or 5. It seemed like I was missing something. We are in two different places in our lives.

So here I am

I love him more than you can imagine. He's one of the most amazing people I know. But I know that this ache for recklessness and freedom will be there forever if I don't fulfill it. I feel like I'll head straight back into that depression if I do this distance for another two years. I can't do that. So my relationship is slowly but surely falling apart in front of me and I'm terrified. 

Has anybody else experienced anything REMOTELY like this? Any words of advice,False,,t5_2vgfw,False,,,t3_1crv8k
1366488150.0,1crbuw,Is this weird or unhealthy? Am I the only one dealing with this?,Kitten_Wizard,16,4,22,"Firstly this doesn't have to do with the subreddit's name

Excuse the wall of text

----------

I want to be the ""athletic bro"" type of guy. I feel so uncomfortable NOT being that and feel like I have been shoving this personality of mine behind barriers of fear and being crushed by the fears. I just have a social pull toward these types of people. I will be the first to say I do have a romantic attraction to the ""athletic bro"" types but this isn't some lust driven scheme to hook up with these types of guys. I am also aware of an emerging trend that the ""str8 acting"" guys are ""hot"" but this honestly has nothing to do with my feelings. I have always felt this social pull. Way back in grade school when I had no idea what homosexuality was, be his friend, and have such an awesome person in my life!"" For a young kid this is a pretty foreign feeling and I had no words to describe how I was feeling. I just knew I wanted to be friends with those types but thought I wouldn't fit in at all so I kept my distance and suffered from the inner conflict. I guess I want to be apart of this group that I have always felt a pull toward but thought I wasn't apart of.

I have always had bad self esteem about myself. Maybe I have always wanted to have specific interests/characteristics (into sports, confident, open to talk to) but felt that I wasn't able to be the person I wanted to be. It’s weird to explain because if a kid is interested in a sport/activity/whatever they usually just go do it and don’t become consumed by how they feel others will judge them, how they expect the situation to play out, how they expect to perform, and the following self judgement of the whole situation. I never had the confidence to join sports and always felt like my performance in the sport meant that everyone was going to dislike me, talk about how shit I am, keeping my distance from most people in fear they would find out how uninteresting

I like the bonding and camaraderie of sports but find that my anxiety about performance and external/internal judgment leads me to staying away from them. Even just the thought of throwing a ball around between friends sounds like a performance test that I will 100% fail and look like a fool. That thought even spirals into that friend starting to distance themselves from me and realizing I am not someone they want to pal around with. I don't judge others the way I feel/think they judge me so it doesn't even make sense why I always feel this way. It's a frustrating and suffocating feeling when all I want to do is be carefree and join in on the fun while at the same time being utterly crippled by the fear of the situation.

Just recently I hit a real low and had a sort of mental shift. Why should I have this pit in my chest - a feeling of longing for something I can’t accomplish. Why should I hate myself for not being able to do what I want to do. Why should I feel like a failure as a human being, and shoving them into a box labeled “Never going to accomplish but lets feel soul shattering emptiness about it.”

Now I am in a way taking this on as a self development. I want myself to get into sports, and be that guy everyone likes to have around. I finally feel motivated and driven to be who I want to be. I am kinda worried that people are going to think i'm a fake guy trying to slither his way into the locker room to catch some naked guys showering. Although I find ""athletic bros"" attractive, seeing some naked guys is FAR from what i’m trying to accomplish. 

**I want to change my “current self” and I want to be one of the ""athletic bros"" I have always wanted to be.**

In May 2006, light brown complexion, in good shape. He seemed like that straight guy that's probably a jerk around his friends, but a completely nice guy when it's just you and him. For lack of a better discription, he looks A LOT like the rapper Drake. I checked his page and saw that he lived in an area in NYC that was very close to my high school, so I added him. He accepted the friend request later that day, but didn't say anything. I didn't say anything either. To be honest

About a week later, almost like he was bothered by my friend request. So I responded with something like ""I thought you were someone I knew, but I guess not. sry."" At that point I'd given up on trying to talk to him. I figured he was just straight or completely not interested. Then about 2 days later, he replied with ""o ok, well i hope that's not all wanted talk about."" Looking at it now I find that message a bit awkward, but at the time I was just over the moon with excitement. This guy was outrageously good-looking and just my type.

Over the next few months, and not wanting to be looked at differently, etc. But I actually had a good number of friends I could talk to about my issues while he genuinely seemed to have none. Only superficial high school friends that would probably talk about him behind his back. I like being the one he could vent to. Gave us a lot to talk about.

Anyway, but potentially my first boyfriend ever. I had no idea what to do or what was expected of me. But being older and way more financially set than he was, I just felt compelled to be the ""alpha"" I guess. I would pay for everything and just do everything that is expected of the guy when straight people are dating. I didn't know how he would take it being that he was more masculine like myself, but I was hoping he wouldn't mind :P

We'd planned to spend the day together. I took the subway to get to his place where I waited at a Starbucks for him to meet me. I was sitting down for 3 minutes before he showed up. I stood up as he was opening the door and just like in a movie, it was one of those ""OMG Karen, I haven't seen you in FOREVERRRRRRR"" hugs. We didn't even seem to care that we weren't ""out"" either, we were just so happy to finally meet. We talked, and got some drinks before leaving the Starbucks. We walked down the pier for a bit (Near the West Side Highway for those familiar with NYC) while talking. Then we took a cab to Times Square where we did just about everything. We went to the ESPN Zone, Broadway City Arcade, Lazer Park, The Toys 'r' Us with the Ferris Wheel

We finished up our date the traditional way with dinner and a movie. We went to see Step Up. It was literally the best choice at the time, but we kissed. Nothing gross and tacky, but a nice 4-5 second kiss. Then he looked a me and smiled, and went inside his building. The moment he closed that door, I knew I was in love with him. He was no longer just an avatar on the internet, but the physical manifestation of everything I wanted.

We made it official after the next few dates and he even moved in with me at my on campus apartment when things got bad at his place. It wasn't under the best circumstances, when I got back from class/work, in the shower, before dinner, after dinner. ALL. THE. TIME. I was completely unreachable on the weekends. This was the best time of my life and I was glad I could be there for him when he needed it. I supported him, and even helped out his Mom when they were facing eviction. I literally would have done anything to keep him happy.

So Fast forward two years, but I also understood that he just wanted to experience ""dorm life"" for a bit. It became pretty hard to reach him and sometimes I wouldn't even hear from him til the next day. The weekend came and he showed up to my place (He still had a key of course) and we got into a big fight. I raged about him ""ignoring"" me and he responded with how he didn't think it was that big a deal. The argument escalated and I said some things I never should have. I made him feel really small as a person, and he left my apartment on the verge of tears. When he closed the door behind him, I knew the severity of what I've done. My pride wouldn't let me chase after him. I called him several times over the next couple of days. Leaving voicemails. Apologizing. He never answered. I went visit him at his dorm on Tuesday morning hoping that I could talk to him before class. I was ready to beg, crawl, whatever I had to do to keep him. I met him as he was leaving his building and asked if I could talk to him for a moment. He listened, but it was clear his mind was made up. He pretty much just said ""thank you for apologizing.. but I'm done."" I was stunned. I knew it was coming, looked back at him, people I play video games with competitively and co-workers. None of which knew I was gay and I would NEVER bring personal drama to work. EVER. I had no one to talk to.

Over the next couple of days. I went to class and work as per usual. But After work, I'd bring some guy back up to my place and just fuck his brains out. I had a lot of anger and frustration to get out. The first five guys just fucked and left. No questions. It was with the 6th guy that noticed I had a picture of my ex and I as my screensaver. He mentioned it after sex though I know he saw it before that. I told him it's a long story, but that we're through. He wanted to know what happened and although it would have been an excellent chance to talk to someone about it, I just didn't have the energy to relive everything in that moment. I just said that's a story for another time, put my arm around him and we went to sleep. It felt nice to have someone sleep in my bed again. That morning, I hope up before the other guy in my bed did. I didn't want to wake him up and kick him out. That's not my style and quite frankly, any company was better than no company. He woke up as I was making breakfast. We ate and talked a little. He said ""My name's Bryan by the way"" as he sat down at his plate. We both laughed and I told him my name as well. He asked if he could take a shower before leaving to which I replied ""sure."" He took a shower and as he was leaving, it hit me that I was left alone with my thoughts again. I spent the entire day thinking of my ex. I knew it would only make me sad

Months went by and I've literally thought about him at least once everyday. It wasn't til about a year and half later that I would have lapses in days where I thought about him. And yes I would actually think ""I don't remember thinking about him yesterday.. .. hmm."" 5 years later, I NEVER expected to run into him. I was checking out the Marvel booth and as I was turning around to go somewhere else, both of our eyes meet. Just like when he opened the door to that Starbucks. I wasn't sure for a moment. He looked a bit different, let his hair grow out and had gotten taller. But then he smiled just like I remembered and I smiled back. It was kind of a tired smile, but I was actually pretty tired, and shocked as hell. He asked how I was doing, and gave me a hug. Maybe time did some healing because this was not the reunion I would have ever imagined. He seemed genuinely happy to see me and even a little flirty. (He felt my abs XD) We talked a bit about the event and caught up a little. He was with friends and I could tell they were trying to get to another booth. So we split and I got on the next shuttle back to my hotel.

PAX East was Mar. 27th, I don't even know how. I'm actually very emotionless about pretty much everything. But not when it comes to him. I always thought high school boyfriends were supposed to stay just that. But he's changed me in so many ways. I used to be so outgoing, and confident. Now I really don't give anyone the time of day. I've had guys hit on me, and sometimes even hit on some guys as well. I never went through with anything. The last person I've been with is Bryan. Btw, I called him a few weeks later to hang out. We're really good friends now :) We haven't done anything since that first night though.

Anyway, and someone I will always love.

So we went to bed. And he asked me if it was the first time that I was  in the same bed with a guy and I shyly said yes. But he knows that I'm a virgin and stuff.

He then asked me if I wanted to cuddle and I said yes. My heart was beating so fast you have no idea. I tried to relax but I was just so excited. I mean, try to imagine how I felt.

And still, yes I didn't come to his place for the dick, but I mean, I really was excited, like a good excited.

TL;DR – New relationship. BF wants it to be open. I'm traveling for two weeks. Not really sure how I feel. Looking for advice on how to make it work without getting hurt myself down the line.

So I've been seeing this guy for the better part of two months. We are in a really young relationship that's honestly been going great. Except for one thing that's been sort of in the background since the 2nd or 3rd date. 

He made it pretty clear that he is pretty sexually charged and really thinks he needs to be with a variety of partners to feel satisfied. At the time we sort of deferred the conversation since it was really early on in the relationship. We have had a pretty accelerated and awesome two months. We have sex about five or six times a week and spend a lot of great time doing various things outside of the bedroom.

Fast forward to now – I'm going to be out of the country for two weeks starting this weekend. 

Laying in bed last night he asks me how I would feel about an open relationship. Specifically, he never had sex with his BF of two years. Apparently they just weren't compatible and he was fine with that. 

Our situation is a little different (or so he says) in that we honestly have really good sex. Really compatible

Thing is – I'm not really sure how I feel about the situation. Mentally I feel like I should be upset – raised and always had mono relationships - but - I guess I would be okay with it

I think I'm more bothered by his phrasing than anything else. He basically summed it up as - ""I just don't understand why you wouldn't be okay with it. It's just sex and I want to be in a relationship with you. However if you feel strongly

The thing is – I really like the guy and I would frankly be okay with letting him do it. My fear is

Anyone go from solely monogamous relationships into open ones? How did you make it work (obviously a lot of communication

1363448647.0,1aeuyx,I need some help figuring something out about my childhood. long post ahead.,lekdatank,14,2,7,"I really need help to figure out what exactly happen to me so I can move on with my life. thanks in advance for reading and commenting. I guess I should start with some background information. I was the 2nd of 4 boys born to Indo (India Hindu) Caribbean parents. We immigrated to the US in the early 80s. I was the forgotten middle child (my youngest brother is 8 years younger than me; there is 1.5 years between my other 2 brothers)

I was 7 or 8 when I discover jerking-off on my own. On the way to school there was a bakery. One day while my mom was walking us and she was talking to my brother, my penis got hard. I was exploring my penis, wondering why it was hard, which led to my discovering jerking-off. It’s great when your younger cause nothing comes out and there is nothing to clean up. You just have a dry organism. So that continued and I added other women to who I would think of when I jerked-off.

During this time, got cancer. She didn’t have a lot of money, so she did what a lot of people do; she went back to our country and looked for someone who was willing to pay to marry her to get a visa into this country. The guy that she met and married, also, had a son, Danny. They immigrated to this country during the spring when I was 9, Danny was 12 or 13. He was a cool older kid that wanted to hang out with me and my brothers.

Ok so this is the part I need figure out.

I guess the first thing that happen was my older brother, this type of stuff appears normal. I was fascinated by Danny’s. It’s much larger and he also said he could make cum. I never saw cum before, so my brother and I left Danny to jerk-off alone. We came back a few minutes later and saw his cum. During this summer, he would frequently show his penis to us like it was nothing.

On day while my parents were busy cooking, grinding, and making out. He flipped me over and started to grind his dick between my ass cheeks. He wanted to penetrate me anally, but something inside of me did not want that to happen. I clench my cheeks really tight and told him that I didn’t want to. He continued to grind on my butt and eventually I got tired. So we got dress and I went back home where no one notice I was gone. (That part makes me more upset than anything else)

I would like to say that was the only time

I grew up in the era of the “A very special episode” of TV shows. They would talk about drugs, I told myself that I was a victim and molested. Danny took advantage me. He had to. If he didn’t, that would mean I was something that was the worst thing that you could ever be in school or home. A faggot. My parents always talk badly and made fun of gays and so did guys at school. I couldn’t be one. Danny made me lust after guys. He turned me into this. I’m just a victim. He’s the reason why I like and look at gay porn and check out guys. Prior to Danny I was thinking about women. It had to be Danny. He was the monster. But I couldn’t tell anyone. If I did it would destroy my family. To this day, you guys reading this are the only people outside of Danny and me that know about this.

I did everything I could to be invisible. I wasn’t the mischievous kid that always got into trouble. I turned in to the good little boy that always behaved, some really good ones and was never bullied. Everyone like the guy that gives credit to others and make them shine. So that what’s I did.

I want to stop thinking of myself as a victim and stop being invisible. I look back and wonder, gay, and bi men’s stories about growing up, including erotica and that made me think about my childhood. Many guys say that knew they were different from an early age and had a friend (or fantasize about a friend) when they were younger that they would fool around with. Then something clicked. I realize that in order to prove to myself that I didn’t have sexual feeling towards men I made Danny into pedophile. He was only 4 years older than me, barely a teenager himself. I would like to say that he initiated all the encounters, but he didn’t. I initiated most of the encounters. Were there times when he wanted to hook-up and I didn’t? Yes, but the inverse is true. Whenever one of us wanted to stop fooling around we did. To be honest

This thought process started when I was forced to watch “That’s My Boy” with my friends. They talk about how lucky all those boys are that get to hook-up with their hot teacher. I would tell them that she was a predator and the kids are victims and will grow up fucked up (like me). It shouldn’t be treated differently because it was a woman that was the abuser. My friend said to me “They grow up fuck up cause everyone tells them what they did was wrong.” That was the second light that went off. I spend my entire life thinking I was a victim and being a wallflower cause I was led to believe that doing anything sexually with a guy was wrong. If Danny was chick

I wasn't sure if he was gay

I was partnered up with him and stuff and it was awesome.

Anyways

Crystal is the head of the cheer squad, etc. She knows I'm not straight, and she still loves me.

2 weeks go by

First home football game

I go up there to spend some hangout time with Zach

They loved me! I was making them laugh the whole time and we had a conversation for like 30 minutes.

After the game

Zach's dad is a pastor.

And boom like that

But also after the football game

And then one of our mutual friends confirmed that Zach was gay. Zach told them that they could tell me.

The thing is

His parents obviously don't know he's gay. He said if he ever told them they'd disown him.

Time goes on and on

Then one weekend

Annnnnddd I said no.

said that we need to spend time together in school and stuff

And then we came back to school, and bonded in sixth period.

I asked him out four days later and of course he said yes. (: all was well

It was great

Cute stuff like that

About two weeks later

It was amazing. Best kiss ever

After that school day

He didn't talk to me for the rest of the day. My friend Ali had talked to Crystal cause they're friends and stuff

The next day at school

And when I had my normal run-in with her in the halls

Yes.

I was about 80% sure Zach's parents found out somehow and were torturing him. I was worried.

Turns out I was right.

The day after he was absent

He told me what had happened.

He told his family everything. They didn't even find out

Crystal was hysterical. His mom grabbed him by his shirt and shook him.

His dad screamed

Then his dad took action.

His dad took everything from him. He sold his phone and iPad after going through and reading all of our text messages.

He took his ""gay seeming"" clothes and burned them

Told him he was going to receive Christian counselling.

Told him he was going to change

And then his dad went up to the school and started raising hell.

He got Zach switched out of his sixth period

He got switched out of his World History class

He sort of ""recruited"" teacher lookouts to let him know if they ever saw me and Zach together.

And then Zach said that it'd probably be better if we weren't together for now

I gave him his necklace and stormed off. Dramatic stuff like that.

And then he wrote me a note. And then I wrote him a note. And then he wrote me a note. And then I wrote him a note. And then he wrote me a note. And then we started sneaking around and meeting up places between class.

It was hard

That went on for about three weeks

Of course they did.

I'll tell you what happened next.

Mind you

I call this part of the story ""The Ambush"".

I went to go see Zach before fourth period

I see him

And then mother fucking Crystal walks out from behind a bush. What the hell

I had gone from like best friends with her to total enemies without a word

Okay

It starts off with Zach saying as gayly as possible

I sorta giggle and say okay.

And then Crystal and him both tell me I need to like stay away from Zach because I'm his temptation and he's trying to change.

Retarded dumb shit like that.

And then Crystal was like, you know what I mean?"" And I rolled my eyes, laughed, then I said ""No. I don't know what you mean."" Then stormed away. (I like storming away)

Then after that

So like every time I saw him in the halls I'd sort of give him a sort of disappointed or sad look

But finally I cracked. We were walking by each other. We were totally prepared to give sad/mad looks to each other. But I just couldn't do it

And then walking down the halls became a special thing and those smiles are like the best smiles in the world.

Still no talking though.

No notes because the 'lookouts' now knew to look out for the notes.

Everyone in the school loves us so lots of people help us out.

Our friend Caitlin

On the way to fifth period we go in the exact same direction at the same time so we walk really close together and talk.

Our friend Priscilla conveys messages all the time.

And Zach got switched into yearbook.

So he's always running around doing errands and taking pictures.

And he goes out of his way to come into my classes and stuff. :')

Like he convinced someone to give him the band page so he could get to spend that little time with me.

And now we've started to have little meetups during school again. It's crazy

Since Zach told his family that he is straight again

Now he's ""dating"" this girl. Katie. She's in on it

I'm not sure they'd be very happy if they found out he dropped the L bomb on me.
This went on for a little while. The girl and him “broke up.”

Then this final week- the week before Christmas break- we didn't really talk or see each other.
We didn't really talk and therefore didn't really arrange any times to see each other.
I didn't talk to him because i wanted to sort of space myself from him before the break so I wouldn't miss him too much over the two weeks.
But I wasn't really sure what was going on with him.
So on the way to class the day before Christmas break
me- ""Hey remember me?""
""Yeah. I can't talk to you anymore.""
""uhhhh why""
""my parents found out again.""
""uhhh how""
""they wouldn't tell me.""
""uhhhh okay... well.. uhhh bye!""
And that's literally the last time I've talked to him.
Or made eye contact with him.
I was okay. I was sort of happy. I was mad he wasn't going to tell me that BEFORE Christmas break. If I hadn't went and talked to him
I heard from one of his friends that his plan was to just not talk to me and hope I'd move on so he didn't have to have confrontation. Something along those lines.
But yeah
Heard nothing from or about him over the Christmas break because
Okay well school starts again.
And apparently he asked this girl out with flowers(Courtney).
And she said yes. And apparently it was real.
I'm really good friends with this girl and I'm still good friends with this girl.
She eventually breaks up with him because you know
Time passes on and on with us avoiding eye contact and acting like we didn't know each other.
And I've been okay with this.
But I've started to have dreams about him.
And people have started talking to me. Including his best friend Amber.
And she's basically told me that he's still crazy about me.
And truthfully I'm still crazy about him even though I shouldn't be.
The girl that he supposedly dated, too. And the plot thickens.
She realllllly likes me. She wants to date

Now I have no idea what to do. I like Courtney, I know, but something about him I can't let go.

I've not dated much and only been with a few guys, 3 of which I've dated, 5 of which are 50+, etc.

If you want to know, but more on that later.

But the issues that make me reluctant to put myself out there and try to date anyone (if I can find anyone to date) are several. The fact that I'm overweight and with so few guys around there is a slim chance any are chasers. I took a picture a moment ago, as I don't think I have a face capable of looking good with Arin Hanson's glorious locks AND Jon Jafari's beard. It's too much for one man to possess. Plus my beard trimmer broke, so the beard is... Untamed. Much like a wild stallion, such beauty and power.

The biggest thing is that I have a very rare auto-immune disease that I was diagnosed with about 18 months ago. It's called Fibrosing Mediastinitis, I was told with 90% certainty that it was cancer: Lymphoma. But after several biopsies and a Mediastinoscopy, it was discovered to be a granuloma. Basically, my body overreacted to the fungus and went crazy with its ""healing"" and the effect is a bunch of scar tissue around and in my vitals, like someone poured concrete into my chest cavity.

This scar tissue is occluding my arteries and veins so that my blood doesn't flow well to my right lung (pulmonary artery) which has deteriorated some, it seems to be stable for now. I have to get yearly CT scans from now on to monitor it, although there isn't anything they can do really. It's all bonded to my organs and stuff, ""like melted plastic was poured into [my] chest"" one doctor put it. If they try to operate to remove it or whatever, there's a good chance they'll have to take my lung, and that I could very easily bleed to death on the table, since it's all over my arteries and veins around my heart. I believe the vena cava is supposed to be something like 15mm diameter


This means that I cannot lay down, causing headaches, vision problems, swelling, possible anyeurisms, etc. I also have chronic chest pain that is sometimes pretty bad. This upper body swelling is known as Superior Vena Cava Syndrome, but mine is rather mild (because it doesn't happen at all times, when I'm standing) and only really noticeable when my head isn't elevated enough. I sleep in an inclined hospital bed and have been put on a CPAP (sleep apnea device) for my breathing/oxygen levels when I'm asleep. I also have blue bruised looking spots on my chest where my body is trying to grow ""collateral veins"" to reroute past my blocked vena cava.

As you might imagine, as happened the last time I tried to have sex (yes, it was doggy). One of the doctors at the Mayo Clinic told me that if I stay too long in a bad position my head will ""literally explode"" because of the pressure of all the blood being unable to get back down to my heart. Obviously it wouldn't be a dramatic explosion, but you get the idea. As long as I have a couple pillows under my shoulders/head though, I am mostly okay.

Bonus health story: I've also recently had a Cubital Tunnel Release performed on my left elbow because I had severe ulnar neuropathy. It turns out I had an extra muscle in my elbow pressing on the nerve (something &lt;5% of people have! I'm so good at lotteries). I might regain feeling in a few years. In the meantime I have a retard hand that likes to hit caps lock sometimes.

Unfortunately, of whom only my father knows I'm gay (my mother's family are messed up backwoods bible thumping types from Arkansas). At the advice of family and friends, I have applied for Disability, but I do not know if I will receive it. My dad also lost his job during the middle of all of this, it was a mess and things were pretty bad. Both my parents were then trying to find jobs, my mother had left her job at Wal-Mart some years before when my nephew was born, against my advice that she couldn't just quit her job to hang out with her grandchild all the time. Thankfully, so we aren't going to all die or live in a cardboard box just yet.

Anyways

There was nowhere for him to go and I didn't want him to stumble into the middle of the street or get into a fight. So we just walked a bit

We grabbed some food and then we took a cab back to my place. Now I have other room mates who were sleeping and had work the next morning so I just brought him into my room and it's no big deal to share a bed with your friend of 8-9 years.

I'm going to say this now, he has a girlfriend).

Well soon enough we fall onto the bed and we're kind of close and he's once again going on about how he can't believe I'll be away. And uh...we kind of have each other in our arms

I kind of laughed and asked 'what about a massage?'

He readily agreed so I started on his back/body as he's on his stomache.

Eventually I asked if he really meant I could do anything and he said yes

We were still talking this whole time about random stuff.

And well, and very hard. And I started to stroke him, but then after a bit, he kind of jumped up and said something like:

""No

Well I got really shy and nervous and I stopped and pulled away.

I told him I was sorry

I moved myself away from him

So I told him again that I was honestly sorry and that I shouldn't have.

He said it was okay

He told me to come closer to him again

He said that I shouldn't be sorry

Soon enough

I kept stroking him off and he said ""Don't be sorry.""

So I went down and started to suck his cock.

Soon enough

He gave me head also

I let him fuck me

There's this guy at my gym who I've noticed checking me out a few times before. Earlier this evening we were alone in the sauna and we started flirting. I agreed to go back to his house to play. This guy is the type of guy who I've long fantasized about; he's in his 40s, and well built. 

Anyways

We chatted for a bit and I noticed a stethoscope on his foyer table. I find out he's a doctor and I get the sense that he's a pretty nice guy. I told him that I was a virgin and while he did seem a little taken aback

Once we were upstairs, he turned out to be a really sensitive lover because before he did anything new he explained what he wanted to do and asked me if I was OK with it. I feel lucky that my first time was with this guy because the whole time he kept making sure I was OK with what we were doing. I assume that because of the 20 year age difference he wanted to make sure I didn't feel like he was taking advantage of me.

We did all the usual things I suppose guys do together: we kissed (my first time romantically kissing anyone ever btw)

Everything felt really good and he was really hot; unfortunately

**Here's what's bothering me**: I let him come on my stomach while I was laying on my back jerking off. In the heat of the moment

I know that everything we did was pretty low risk

In retrospect, I found out that he has been with women and a few guys before, but I never bothered to ask his HIV status, not that you can really trust someone to tell the truth in these circumstances anyway.

 I have a couple issues and questions I guess I would like some help with. Been a lurker for a while now over on r/gaybros but thought I would finally ask something. 
Basically my question is
So to start I have been told I am attractive(cute), educated etc. etc. so I am pretty sure that is not the issue with me and dating. I have been told I am a nice guy, very considerate and loyal. Been also told I am shallow, stubborn and kind of standoffish. So maybe it's a personality defect.
I meet most of the guys I go out with on ""OkCupid"" and ""Grindr"". I know Grindr most likely isn't the best place to look but I have met some really nice guys who I have been interested in dating and not hooking up with so who knows. Regardless after talking to someone the general process below tends to ensue.

1. A party expresses interest
2. Party either accepts interest or declines
3. Assume party has accepted interest. We plan a meet up
4. Chit Chat, etc.
5. Go our separate ways for the evening after both expressing interest in meeting again. All interest seems genuine.
6. Keep texting.
7. Everything falls apart for seemingly no reason.

Is this standard? I can't say I have a ton of dating experience so maybe this is how the world works and I am just missing something.

Thanks for any help and opinions.

Edit: I guess I will also ask if anyone has any tips or thoughts about closure after dates. Is it okay to ask if they are interested if things seem vague? Or if there is a break down in communication is it appropriate to ask if they have lost interest or is that just looked upon poorly?",,t5_2vgfw,1373823365.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1ia27f/need_some_help_with_dating_and_such/

I know the first thing many here will say is that I NEED NEED to be ""out"". The thing is, only other people's perceptions of me. Unless there is a secret sign that I only get by being out, another ""Bro"" wouldn't even know about me anyway, so what difference would being out really make? I've been to gay clubs before, so I am not scared of being in a gay centered place, but these places are not really who I am. To clarify, I don't avoid gay clubs because they are ""too gay""

So here's the breakdown:

Since I was a teenager I had mostly straight male friends. So I am used to hanging around with people outside my dating scheme. Sure there was a crush or two

Time Jump: I am now living in a big city with a new circle of friends. 
Still having mostly straight guy friends and my gang of two very close girl friends. The only thing that has changed
lifestyle.

So I am hanging out with the boys in the evening and going drinking with the girls at night. It is exactly the wonderful confusing growing up in a big city I always wanted.

Until Joe showed up.

He just moved with his girlsfriend to the city and joined my theatre group. He is kind of the exact opposite to me and at first we didn't get along very well. But as timed moved on we grew closer as friends. We would go out partying alot and would have the magical conversation only bros could have.

He grew more and more on me. I was even more content with my life now I had a guy friend like in my teenage years.

I have no idea when I realised that I am madly in love with him but since then I feel miserable. I can barely find sleep. I can not concentrated on my work. I stalk him everyday on facebook. This stupid little nerd has turned me, into a giggling school girl.

That the problem: It is not a crush anymore it is love. I don't want to see him naked and have manly steamy sex with him. No I want to marry him and raise wondeful children. It is horrible. I am stuck in this Disneyesque Daydreams. It has renderd my complete lovelife non existing.

So what can I do?

I don't see me telling him. Telling him ""Oh and by the way you are the man of my dreams so please turn gay now."" would make everything a little bit more akward. Moreover I will see him in my theater group and the group is very important for my social and emotional life so I can't quit. He is 100% straight and happy with his lovly girlsfriend.

I am pretty sure he has no clue. Nevertheless there was this night when we all talked about our dream kind of partner. Being that very talented bastard of an actor we did a spot on impression of my favorite accent

It wasn't until a year later that I had a chance to talk to a guy I really liked.  It was probably my first ever ""date"" situation.  I went up to him at the bar, we we ended up going out for a drink that night and then coming back.  We get to my room, and I couldn't get it up...I didn't even jerk off for 4 days.  End of it all we just cuddled, but of course, right when he fell asleep while we were in each others arms I started to pop one.

Fast forward to one year later, he came to my room.  We messed around for hours and hours, but the entire time I wasn't able to get it up.  I was super drunk and tired, but even in the morning nothing.

Since then I have been trying to get more exposure around guys.  I was VERY flaky at first in the bar/app scene.  But in the end, Im afraid to come off as ""slutty"".  I am over 6.5ft tall, fit, bearded, hairy.  I get a lot attention from of the young twink types thinking I am a top.  But I know I am pretty sub/bottom and I like guys who are also slightly older and the hairy type.  Age isn't a +/-, I am comfortable from 2 years younger to 10 years older.

Within the last month, I still couldn't get it up, every time.   I would wake up in the middle of the night very aroused, but whenever he would get naked and start putting on the moves I couldn't get it going.  I later learned that he had multiple ""boyfriends"" and was a huge whore, but I am emotionally over all that now.

Is it weird for me to think that I can only get over this problem if I am in a relationship where I can consistently see the same person?  I feel like if I was able to see someone on a regular basis, so lots of negative self image surfaces every once in a while.  The other issue is that, if I know I am talking to a guy who sleeps around a lot, it is a total turn off as I am super paranoid about STDs.

Sometimes, they are afraid of just saying, ""No, I'm not interested"" or ""I'm flattered, but you're not my type"". These are responses I personally would prefer to receive, instead of the ubiquitous, ""I'm super busy"", ""I think I have something planned"", I've been at the receiving end of some pretty fucked up diarrhea. However

I've gotten to the point where I can smell bullshit a mile away, these remarks often promise false hope. For example, after a response of ""I work till late tonight"", I used to respond with, ""No worries, let's meet up Friday for drinks at (name of local bar)"" or ""Sure, just let me know when you're up to hang out"" 

Later, you'd be considered the least cost avoider and be deemed liable for damages (thank you Judge Posner). 

Thanks to a background in economics, I came into sudden clarity today: **directness in one's intentions saves both parties time, effort, and energy.**Thus, statements like, ""No I don't want to date you"", ""I find you more of a platonic friend than a romantic interest""

Having been direct with people, I ask them out. When someone I don't like asks me out, my go to response is, ""Thanks, but I just don't think it's going to work out"" and if they're are persistent (a trait I admire), I revert to ""Please fuck off, I'm really not interested"". 

If you're not interested in me, we know that if you're interested in someone, you'll move mountains for them. I mean I once called every ""G. Davis"" in my freshman orientation book just to see if he wanted to grab a ""cold beverage"" with me.

I've always thrived on relationships developing organically, finding myself in a constant game of sizing up the person in front of me, and knowing I'm constantly being sized up.

I don't know. I don't have any more things to say.

I have a situation that I could use some advice on. There is an incredibly Christian and conservative member (James) of my very liberal friend group. We have all been friends for about a year. Being the only anti-lgbt member of the group

Things got a little dicey when DOMA and Prop8 went up before the supreme court. He was posting all the reddit-like things you see on the front page that supported inequality in the inane ways. One of my gay friends (Luke) messaged James in a fit of rage. James' response was filled with the message of the love of Jesus

This breaks my heart. I remember my days of deep spirituality, but determined I was. I also remember how resistant I was to help. 

So

How did you come to accept that you weren't going to change? 

How did you distance yourself from that religious thought?

Could any other person have been helpful in your self realization? How?

1369332274.0,1ex0qg,Perspective and Advice Needed:,gaybrosthrownaway,14,3,13,"Let's start this off with some facts. I'm 20, in the closet

My story is this. I go to a small,000 person student body which means that within weeks after arriving you've noticed and been in relatively close proximity with almost everyone. When I came to college it was fun to look around at all of the hot guys and hope to be noticed and ask/be asked out by one of them. For financial reasons (homophobic parents paying for college), social reasons (my sport which I have invested 15 years into is incredibly homophobic) and fear of reprisals I had to remain in the closet which meant I couldn't date anyone and my contact with my fellow gays was limited to craigslist/manhunt/grindr hookups only. Being able to dial someone up on Grindr and get my rocks off 20 minutes later would generally do it for me most of the time but more and more frequently I began looking for someone to have an actual connection with. Throughout all of this there was one guy on campus who was a year ahead of I that continued to catch my eye and every time I'd see him I would think to myself that he was the most beautiful guy I'd ever seen and what I could deduce from observing from afar was that his personality was even more attractive than his 9-10 looks. He's a very flamboyant character with lots of friends and always seems to be laughing or cracking jokes. Combine that with Abercrombie-model looks and a solid brain on his shoulders and it was an instantly strong attraction that I hid well and would ponder on from time to time in the ""if life was perfect we'd be together and happy and have amazing sex every night"" way. 

Life went on like this for the first 3 years of my education. I posted good marks, how much I admired him and what I'd like to do to him in bed. A few days later a past hookup of mine and mutual friend of mystery guy asked if the posting was me because apparently mystery guy had been talking about it and was hinting that he was interested in making something happen. As the hopeless romantics among you can appreciate I was well over the moon at this and with time running out I figured that it was my last chance to do something. After a week-long confidence building period I added him as a friend on facebook out of the blue and was quickly accepted. Another week of stressing, writing, rewriting and panic attacks and I sent a message owning up to the posting. To my delight it was very well received and we got to chatting through facebook about all sorts of platonic stuff on and off for 2 weeks. A busy schedule meant I never thought about nor had time to ask him to get coffee or something but we sort of got to know each other through our semi-regular conversations and it was clear that we were both interested in the other person. In retrospect not asking him out on a date is what I regret the most because what happened next might 

As finals started coming around everyone at campus gets stressed and, smiling, moaning, giggling, screaming and adorable pillow talk. We both seemed to have serious chemistry and by the end each of us was expressing expressed interest in keeping something going in the future. A kiss goodnight and I was headed home. The next day he had to work and I had to move out so that night was the last time I saw or spoke to him. 

We're now living 3 hours apart and we've both started summer jobs but we're both on facebook all the time. A few days later, how are things going?"" message and, again, got no response despite the message being seen.

So with all of the back-story out of the way here's my questions? It's obvious that I'm either being blown off

TL;DR: Long-term crush on a guy, we both want to keep something going afterwards, total radio silence on his end since the second we kissed goodbye. WTF Do I do?

I had kind of know I was different through middle school and had liked girls but never really knew why I had similar feelings for guys. Then when I joined the football team freshman year I made two friends. Lets name them ""Mike"" and the other ""Phil"". So we were grouped up in football based on our height and weight and so Mike, (I was the smallest of the three lol). We all instantly became good friends

Well I started getting close to these two but I had a particular liking towards Phil (and now I realize it was cause he was Mexican and I love mexican guys lol). We started hanging out outside of school and our second semester we had some classes together. Sat next to each other all semester and he was shy but I thought it was really cute. It was during the spring time that I realized I had a crush on him and that's when I set out on determining his sexual orientation. 

At this point I had not told anyone that I liked guys so this was my attempt at trying to find someone that was like me so I could feel normal in a sense ad that i wasn't alone. We started hanging out even more and I started walking him home. We had our laughs and similarities like about tv shows

I later came out to one of my friends from since I was in 3rd grade about him and she was shocked cause I guess she had no idea haha. But she wasn't any help to me and even said I should talk to a counselor to make sure about myself. So in a last ditch effort I came out to Phil to see if he would come out too. Sadly he didn't and we start to drift apart. We were still friends but after sophomore year we stopped talking cause we didn't have classes and yada yada. But even though I was a little heart broken

What were your guys' first crush like? Did anything happen or was it a flop like mine?

I've only been out for a year

A little bit more back story, and asked if I liked him because he had been into me for about a year. I said yeah, and we ended up making out. So we went on dates, ended up hooking up a few times, and it was awesome. I wasn't feeling so shitty, and those things I hate about myself were starting to dissipate. We were getting along really well, and taking it slow because we both didn't want our friendship to get strained. On our last date he asked how I felt about being his boyfriend officially, and made these past few months feel fantastic. 

Last night he calls me, and he said he didn't know. Ke kept telling me that he wants to know why he feels this way, and how hard it was for him to make this phone call. He was getting pretty upset, and told me he still wants to talk to me because like me he feels like no one really listens to him...and I said not for awhile.

We actually moved into a really cool apartment with another friend about 6 months ago and all was perfect until Friday night.

My friend had a celebratory night so I knew he was going on a big one. He got a bag of coke (7pm) and sniffed it with another friend and then they left to go to a bar.

They arrived back (12pm) to me chilling on the couch with a lady friend (with a certain amount of history) and we had smoked 2 spliffs.
He arrived in the door and launched into a coked up rant that last 3-4 minutes

I have manners and would never talk the shit he spouts let alone in front of girl. In short he was saying how girls are cum-buckets who are only there to service his massive slong......(not that big
So he see the awkwardness in both myself and my lady friend and basically says he doesn't care what we think as ""both of you are the only girls in the room"". This was said with a derogatory air about it.
A few moments later he made an effort to call me lesbian but was quick to reel it in when I made eye contact with him mid sentence. Additionally to this he made other statements to me ""to wreck my stoned buzz"" that aren't really relevant to the title but he was out to humiliate me on those.

I'm 23 and 4 months ago I found the man of my life (I might be overreacting but it really feels like it). He is my first boyfriend and first person i have intimate relation with. (He had sex with several guys before
Last month we started having some fun in bed. But unfortunately I have problems with getting hard. At the beginning it felt terrible. I felt useless and almost cried each time he asked me if he's doing something wrong (he was doing perfect). Actually at some point I have to jerk myself and let him finish when I was close (last night it took more than 3 hours!)

I think I am having problem with the fact that my whole life I was masturbating a lot and I am not used to other person doing that. I love him and I want him to see how much I enjoy that. We talked a lot about it and he said that he completely understands this and will help me to deal with it. But I am having doubts.
Do you think that I will be able to eventually deal with this? Will time spent with him help me? 
Do you have any kind of advice that could help me?
I would appreciate something that would give me some hope.

The problem was Matt did not feel the same way towards me, that night i cried for the first time in front of another man.

I never followed up with anything (I can't afford it and telling my parents or relatives would mean opening up and telling them I'm gay) . Right now (surprisingly) my depression is not as bad but I feel it still doesn't let me function properly. What do I know anyways

Since I've grown so disconnected from people

So the question for all of you and that I hope you could help me with.

Is it fair that I do that to them? Is it fair that I relate them as a part of all the emotional pain when they don't even know how I'm feeling? I have a feeling that I'm being selfish. 

I've been thinking that if I ever comes out to them and they don't approve I will just move away and they'll  never hear from me. It's not that hard for me


Sorry if this question bothers anyone or it seems stupid. I really am confused with what to do.

i'm a 30 yo guy - fairly 'straight' fella here.

i've had feelings for guys in the past (since i was ten probably), i've realized that it's not just a phase, i'm interested in being with guys as well as girls.  i know ppl say this is a phase, before i truly come out as gay, but i seriously can have love/affection/lust/fulfillment for women and men.  i've only had one 'encounter' with a guy and while i was nervous, it also felt right.

so, it's taken me about 10 or 15 years of just shaking the stigma for me to even begin to 'be myself' and just let whatever happens, happen.

so, but i definitely am conflicted about how to ""come out"".  first reason being the ""bi"" thing and even some of the gay guys i've talked to / hung out with - have immediately dismissed me upon hearing i'm bi (how's that for annoying/childish/selfish?).  secondly, i guess, comes more into play due to my family situation, i'm a triplet and I know there will be a million questions from whoever i tell - how come i'm bi but my siblings aren't - blah blah blah.

the last part is - part of me feels like i'm lying because i'm NOT saying anything when people ask ""how come you're not back in the dating scene""/etc. (I was in a LTR with a girl for 5 years).  but the other half of me says ""eff it - why should i HAVE to come out?!?"" it's my life

thoughts/suggestions/etc.  so far, i've thought about it for a long time.  i know coming out isn't easy - and i've literally now spent years grappling with the thought of it.  I guess I was hoping it would be easier for me to get into a ""non-straight"" relationship before i tried to 'come out' - but - i guess that's not really an option - yet (heres to hoping)",,False,,t5_2vgfw,1375732786.0,,

I met this guy on OKCupid and we have been seeing each other for about 2 months. We really hit things off on our first date but after that night every time we went out his roommate and the girl she was dating would always end up with us at some point. It was fine at first but when he started asking me to stay over after I got off work (because of our conflicting schedules not allowing us much date time) I would show up and we would just sit there talking to them until he had to go to bed for work. Any time we would go out for dinner they would be there

He would never come to my apartment because he doesn't want to come to Brooklyn and about 2 weeks ago his sister came into town and although he is older than I am he isn't out to his family so we didn't talk for the duration of her visit. After that I stopped sleeping over. I had to have surgery this past week because I've been sick but he texted me the day before asking me if we could actually hang out when I recovered or if I was just blowing him off

There is another guy I know who I've been talking to recently but mostly I just hate how boring the relationship got so quickly and I really disliked how much he told me I would have to work to get his friend's approval and then when I had been ""approved"" we were never alone together unless he wanted to fool around. 

I know I don't see a future with this guy, basically what I'm asking is how do I let this guy know that I'm not interested anymore? We met online so can I just text him and say how I feel or do I have to risk us hanging out and breaking up with all 3 of them at once?

Tl;dr: After we had our [epic night together](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1gkzkv/first_time_i_was_and_got_cuddled_got_raging_boner/) he has been reserved for me super~~(is this a thing in English language / can I say it like that?)~~ and seems like he does not want to tell me something straight
  
Longer version(actually really long one..):  
We had our night together a month ago. From that day we have not met. He said that he has all this *job thing to do*, but it has been a month. He has said that he has to do a lot of others stuffs, like, hang out with friends, go to official or other parties, like, friends birthdays etc. Then he had to spend day with sisters children, because i have mentioned like it has been – I really want to see him, as i am assuming, was it interesting?” and he just answered in the lines of „umm it was really really good!”. And that’s it. Before our night he usually replayed with question *a long the lines of* how was „your days? What did you do?” or something. He usually used smileys too..before.. before that night we both were in „same position” in ‘who will start conversation’
The worst thing – once a week we have this skype convo’ that I start (obviously) and he mentions things that I want to have, and he answered with „eye to eye.. hand on hand. Like that, right?” and then I melt and have this feeling „oh, he still likes me..! All hope is restored!”. Seems like he is doing that with intention to keep me alive just for a little but more; like not completely killing, but slowly taking away my oxygen and then pumps me with it once a week so I don’t die.  
Another thing ~~(I am sorry if someone reads this and is bored!)~~. He easily drives to beach, just because he can and here comes this thing – he would not drive to me when he would want to (he has implied twice or three times that he would „now” drove to me in middle of night) but after a while says that he is not going to and one if his reasons(only one that he has told to me) is that it costs him about 10$ one way (that would be converting money, I don’t live un USA).  
Are my explanations rational – he is actually pumping me with oxygen once a week so I would not completely die or i am just over-thinking this too much because of affection i got from *that night*?  
P.S. Week after that night I had this thing that we have in our country – name day, not like I really celebrate that day, but I really wanted only his congrats that he did not deliver not even after a week when we had a chat in skype.  
P.S.S. – I have acknowledged that I was too into-it-all at first, he has not met even those like meeting me in real life just for 30 minutes. Neither do i write to him every day, I usually write to him once every two-three days, when I want to.

I had us tickets to a baseball game and 15 minutes before we meet he suggested that we do something else, I've never met someone who needed to feel superior in every aspect, always talking about who he knows, how college bores him and how things he doesn't find interesting are beneath him. I couldn't believe how arrogant he was about everything, even the tickets I paid for weren't good enough for what he's used to. 

He told me he liked me at the end and I just said I've never been out with someone quite like you before.

Next was the date. usual stuff, caught a movie (how horribly cliche), and over all had a great time. Now there where some awkward quiet moments through out the day (maybe 3 or 4) but I thought it went really well over all. we shared some stories on the way back to my place to get him directions home, hugged, and saw each other off.

more than a few hours later i get a message close to midnight from him saying he enjoyed the day and would love to do it again, not that it was a bad thing), and we should just befriends until were both in ""a better financial state to do so (date)"". Id love to just stay friends as thats what i was looking for to begin with, we just happened to click, but i cant help but feel that getting this response after ""id do anything to make it work"" that i somehow fucked up somewhere during the day?

I was going to go hang out and possibly sleep over at his place for a couple of days this week but we both came down with a cold and had to postpone. do you bros think i should let this friendship stay the way it is? let it die off and fade out? peruse him and see if we can make a relationship work?

They have been known to not only propagate anti-gay sentiments around the world but have also been accused of eltro shop thearpy and other now commonly denounced practices in the psychology world. Even with this torrid past, up until this year, they were still considered the default ministry for churches worried about someones sexual prefrances.

About two months ago I began exploring what it's like to be gay. I knew for awhile, and it's made me reluctant to tell anyone else.

After a few weeks of feeling miserable, I know he's being honest. But I wish he would at least take a minute to see how I'm doing... It was hard telling him, and I really need some kind of support. The problem now is I don't have anyone to talk to about everything I'm going through.

I'm upset that I won't be able to have kids on my own. That my parents won't get to meet any grandkids from me, fun girl whose number I'll probably never call. That I shamelessly went home with a few guys out of loneliness to see what it was like, and I still feel guilty about it. And finally, that I'm not sure I'll ever find the right guy because I don't know where or how to look.

It's all I can do not to just go to my room and bawl my eyes out. Meanwhile  I'm stuck at my parents' house watching my sister while they're out of town

Well, but it turned out I was just being a bit of a dipshit and things went ahead as planned. And they went pretty well, eventually planning to have a third date, with somewhat regular contact in between.

On our third date (last Friday) we also had a good time. Spent a good while talking, then we went out to eat. I had to be somewhere the next day, so there was relative disappointment on his end as he expected me to spend the night. He drove me home, chatting and laughing along the way. When we were finally outside of my house, we kissed, he told me ""we'd talk"", and I went inside. However, I asked if it would be alright to call him at some point

I got a text the following night from him asking how my thing went (a family event of sorts). He's a bit short on texts and email, and was relatively reassuring. The next time I'd hear from him would be this past Monday. He had a thing to go to that night, career related, so I sent him a text early afternoon saying ""Hey, have fun at your shindig. Maybe I can call you later?"", to which he replied ""Thank You."" and nothing else. I found it odd, figured he's busy

Wednesday night I tried calling him around 8:30-9:00 (once), how are you, talk to you later"") and that's been it, no calls, no texts, no emails. I'm not quite sure what to do from here, how to initiate contact and set up a fourth date

Someone asked me in my previous thread if I'm expecting a constant stream of telegrams, but I guess I'm just not used to guys maintaining radio silence and being relatively weird outside of dates (and it's easy to over analyze shit for me). I'm probably freaking out long before the point where most normal people would freak out. Some people, this gent included, aren't so jazzed about phone calls, texts, emails, and I'm trying to maintain a certain level of respect for that, because I start to analyze why I'm so distraught over no contact, my boyfriend anytime soon. With that being said

When we are together, connecting over music, art, movies, esoteric/occult stuff, and I genuinely enjoy being around him. It would seem the feeling is (or was) mutual, so I'm thrown for a loop. I do find him interesting and somewhat worth pursuing, I'm going to say ""well

I guess I'm wondering, send a simple email at some point, or just leave it. I'm painfully clueless with this crap. People say to follow your gut. Well, my gut says send an e-mail. Say ""Hey, I called you the other night. Wanted to see if you were down for hanging out next weekend. Let me know."" and keep it simple. No response? You have your answer, fucking get over it, listen to Theologian and use the subsequent anxiety to make artwork. Positive response?

Fast forward to today, but that he wasn't expecting me to perform magic either.

However when discussing Saturday plans with him, and welcome at the Sunday event. He later explains that a previous friend of mine, who is also gay and now hates me (because I told his bf that he was cheating) will be attending the Saturday activities. Mind you this person doesn't know anyone in our circle of friends whose only ties with my friend is that he works with said friend's wife. This person never talks to or hangs out with my friend, but somehow his appearance at said party takes precedent over me.

I was quite shocked, which only made the situation worse. Needless to say that I was a tear filled 25 minute drive home.

During said drive I reflected on my life and I now just feel lonely. Our shared circle of friends was actually his circle of friends that I was brought into when my friend and I began to hang out, to any hangouts with friends. I have no friends outside said group. I am trying to desperately distance myself from him, as I feel like I will no matter the outcome end being hurt and emotionally drained. To add insuly to injury, we work together, in the same office, 40 hours a week. I also don't have a boyfriend, or any significant other, i dont usually do anything with my parents or sibblings.

1365010003.0,1bll2l,Things not going well with the bf. Not sure what to do.,floridageek,14,4,18,"Hey guys

I know there's probably a lot of this kind of thing here but it seemed like a good place post and vent. Also it seems like a lot of people have good advice here.

Just a quick summary to give perspective. My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. This is my first serious relationship. I've chatted with a few guys online before dating and only dated one other guy for 3 months. He's had several boyfriends in the past and is 10 years older than I.

Last night was just awful. We ended up getting into a huge fight at a friends birthday party while on the way to the after party.

The fight is the same every time. This is the 5th or 6th time and each time it gets worse. Here's what we fight about.

I used to own a house. After 3months he moved in to help me pay my mortgage which I was having a hard time paying alone. I also had my younger brother living with me who I was helping get on his feet. Times got too tough and he was stressed because it was not a good location for his work. I decided to sell the house and we started looking for a new place together.

During this time we went to a BOH concert and got into a fight. He was upset because he had some kind of expectation of the night which I didn't live up to. Then he said he wasn't sure if he was right for me. This comment changed everything. I freaked out and could not commit to living with someone if they feel this way. When I met him he was living with his ex and I saw how crazy and awkward it was. I was not going to be in that situation. I told him 3 days later we needed to find separate places but I still wanted to be with him. He did not take it well but came around and got his own place and I moved in with some friends.

My boyfriend drinks

As I've said each time we have this fight it gets worse. Every time he's said the same thing. ""I love you but I don't know if I'm right for you. I don't have to be with you. I'm an awesome person and can find someone else."" I find this ironic since not 5min later he was crying saying he was never gonna find someone and be alone forever and that every relationship has been a waste for him and he has nothing to show for it. I find this to be self-loathing and pathetic and I feel sorry for him.

To me if you're right for someone you'd never say this

After the fight I had to drive him home back to my place since we carpooled. He was shitfaced but was smart enough to know not to drive. I let him stay at my place but I should have slept on the couch. Early morning he was half-crying saying how sorry he was and he loves me etc etc. It gets a little creepy to me too because he's like, say something nice to me"". It's the same story every time that it's predictable. I don't even know how to reply to this and I can't stand it. 

I'm fairly certain in my heart I need to break it off even though I don't want to. I do love him a lot and I get sad thinking of living without him in my life. I'm afraid of continuing to ""try"" however when I know it never changes or gets better. I try to keep confident and think someone is out there for me. I had hoped it was him. I'm afraid I'll regret breaking up with him and passing up someone that I know does love me.

I forgot to mention I'm meeting him tonight to ""talk"".

I have been dating this wonderful guy for a month now, I found out this past weekend (he told me) that of his three close male friends, he has been in a longterm relationship with 1, he has drunkenly made-out with one, and he has slept with and dated his current roommate.  Most of this went down several months ago, and he has been close friends with them ever since.  They all see each other about 4 times a week.

I am a bit old-fashioned, but rather a really fun activity (he has also frequented in more 1-night stands than he can count, always being safe, of course).  I don't look down own that sort of thing, but that assessment has undermined the intimacy that we currently have and is now really challenging my worldview of the relationship.  I have also met these friends, and as someone who does not have casual sex, I find it extremely awkward to meet his old sexual partners.

So my question is this- has anyone been in this situation before?  How do you deal with meeting lovers past and knowing that he has friendship-love but not romantic-love for them?

A bit of background: when I was about 12 (I'm 19 now), but I didn't equate what I was looking at online to homosexuality. In high school, guys never really caught my eye, but I knew I wasn't sexually attracted to girls — at the time, I played that off as my ""Christian values to respect women"" (I'm no longer a Christian btw). There were a few girls that I knew were interested in me but I was never interested in them. I had sex with a friend (girl) just to say I lost my virginity, but I had a difficult time keeping it up and couldn't finish.

After graduating high school and become more independent, but I think in this case the booze brought out the truth. Then the *actual* gay porn started to intrigue me, and I was very easily turned on by it. I started crushing on male celebrities. I started looking at guys and noticing little things, like how I was attracted to a guy by the way he carries himself in addition to appearance. I'm crushing on a few guys that I know are gay. I have a strong desire to kiss, hold hands, cuddle, and have sex with a dude. Pretty much the entirety of homosexuality

My mind is pretty messed up though. Sometimes I think that once I started noticing my attraction to guys, but most of my feelings arose just in the last year.

I don't know why im sad. He took it very well I suppose. He smiled a lot and kept acting as nice and awesome as always.

However

Other bits of information:

* In the week since I've told him

* We work together so I see him basically everyday and normally also at least once every weekend.

* I have a major crush on him, he is just the coolest most awesome guy I've met in a very long time, and I know for a fact that the feeling is mutual (at least up to recently, hopefully also after my coming out).

Here are the problems:

* We are so similar and because of many little things I truly thought he was bi. But he hasn't told me anything so... I must now assume he isn't (or doesn't want to embrace that side). It's a bit dissapointing but obviously this isn't why I'm sad

* We used to always flirt

* Now I am overanalizing and overthinking every single thing he does or says to try to see if anything has changed or not. I now always feel a bit nervous because I conciously try to act the same as always. I am normally a funny person around him and this is making be quite the opposite lately.

* I have never told this to someone I care so much about... and now that I did I somehow feel clingy, not only do we not talk about those extra things, but also I haven't even mentioned at all anything about me being gay. So far I'm basically pretending nothing happened....

* I am pretending nothing happened because he is a VERY undramatic chill and uncomplicated person and so am I. Maybe that's why I hate this situation and these feelings so much and why he's the first non-gay person I ever tell :(

I don't go out very much. Until recently, for the first time in a long time, I went out by myself. I had a good time and decided I would go out tonight. 

I live a little over an hour from Ft Wayne, hardly any gays. I made the drive and arrived at After Dark around 11. As I approached the bar, I could see the place was busy. Cars all over the place and hardly any parking. 

My heart started racing at the prospect of walking into the club with so many people there. I drove around for a bit, though.

I parked my car and fucked around with my phone for a few minutes. Logged into Grindr and checked out the faces that were nearby. I started getting messages from people and quickly logged out. Mustered up the courage and made the trek towards the door. It's raining slightly at this point.

I approach the door and there is a guy standing outside, but I walk right past. Right past the dancing guy and right past the front door. I stop at the corner of the building and realize the smoking patio is just twenty yards away. I hear chatter and some girl laughing. I imagine she is laughing at me.

I turn around and walk back towards the door. And I walk right past it. The dancing guy is ignoring me.

I stop at the other corner of the building and pull out my phone, and despite the fact that there is a tall fence shielding the parking lot from view, I feel dozens of eyes watching me walk.

I got in my car and made the hour drive back home. Came in the house, I'll watch some porn and jerk off in bed, just like I do every night of my pitiful life.

I said already that I went out last night and had a good time, and right when I walked in I saw an old acquaintance, a drag queen that performs there regularly. He wasn't performing last night, but he would be tonight. I would not be able to shadow him like I did last night.

On the way home, don't take chances, don't put yourself out there. I hate that about myself, but I don't know any other way.

2. It seems most people who message me say very little - usually something along the lines of ""Hey man"" or ""You seem fun"".  Is this pretty common?  It makes it harder to get the conversation rolling because they basically just left it in your court.

3. If you find someone who seems fun to hang out with, and they say they are looking for new friends, is there a good way to go about establishing that?  I guess, meeting up with them but making sure they know it's on the friend level?

**Background:** I pretty much figured out recently that I'm bisexual. I am so into this *one* guy. We just met this year, I thought I was crazy and hated myself for having such feelings. I learned to accept it, and it has made me 100% happier. Now, my feelings for him blocks our friendship from time to time. He doesn't know, and there's a good chance he'll never. 

**Update:** So, now the ball is not always in his court. Good.

He confuses me so much though. He touches me, there is other guys and *girls* around. He's also been joking about me and him, together. In a way. One time, we squeezed between two desks and he looked and me and said, ""Nut to nut."" So many butterflies.  He looks at me and smiles at me a lot too. Ugh.. I have no idea what he's meaning by it either, if there even is a meaning. He doesn't understand how attracted I am to him, and that pretty much everything he's got is a turnon. -_- 

Even with all the confusion, and we honestly can't even look into each others eyes without cracking up. Such an improvement from my first post when we were pretty much strangers.  He makes me so happy, and I hope I do the same for him. I see a good friendship in the future with him, and maybe -hopefully- something more. 

Still the other problem persists though, and we had plans of hanging together with our dates (I know, ironic.) and his birthday party is Sunday and he invited me himself. So this weekend is going to be fun! :)

1376424383.0,1katpx,My pseudo-out existence and how to fix things?,GabrielGray,9,2,3,"My life is complicated. 

Out status: Most friends at school

Parents don't know

I'm also in a fraternity. I joined this fraternity when I was a first semester freshman and I still considered myself ""straight"" (I hadn't accepted that I liked guys and figured having sex with a girl would fix things). I thought joining a fraternity would be the easiest way to get laid. 

Fast forward a year and I realize i'm gay and start coming out. My brothers were pretty much accepting but you can tell that being a gay brother wasn't something that was ever intended. It's hardly ever talked about it and I hear the words ""fag"" and ""you fucking faggot"" (not ever directed at me but at others) and stuff all the time. I'm scared to really even discuss gay things around them or it's just extremely awkward. It's at the point where it's like I never even came out and never mentioned. Is that bad? I seriously was considering just quitting the fraternity but when you come to a school with no friends the ones you have from your life as a Greek ends up permeating your entire life. If I left the fraternity literally every single aspect of my social life is affected and the university is SO small that I'd never get away from the brothers. 

I'm back in forth in my head because not all the brothers are like this. Some are very supportive and I can't help feeling like me quitting would be like a slap in the face for those that were actually there for me. Fast-forward two years and here I am today still going back in forth in my head. It's really gotten to the point where my college experience has become defined by this state of existence. 

I can't talk to my brothers about this obviously and I can't talk to my family because i'm not out to them. I'm 21 and terrified of coming out to them. Everyone is saying that i've changed and I feel like i'm starting to resent my brothers and my relationship with my family has deterioriated so much that doing anything with them just feels like a chore.

I know this is pretty long but I really just wish I wasn't gay or hadn't come out because it's just been 3 years of regrets, the University is ridiculously small and I don't want to vent my frustrations if others will find out because everyone knows everyone. 

I don't really know what i'm asking here but what's the solution? Am I stuck in this rut until I graduate?

So basically, but whenever I try to finger him, he says my nails are too sharp.  I have cut them back to where it hurts me to cut them any further.

A few things:

* I do not have any toys
* I have tried letting my nails grow slightly and doing it
* I know fingering isn't for everyone
* I want to loosen him up more so that he can have an easier time taking me (even though I am not that big)
* I have never bottomed (and my bf hasn't wanted to top me) so I dont know that much about bottoming at all.

Well, but was too nervous to keep a boner. My bf and seemed to bottom easily (fingering) and keep a boner when he tried to top. It pretty much screwed my mind up for a while. Eh. I'm pretty much over it now.

After I got some advice here and there

I wanted to try more and actually top him today. I had tried to top him a couple times before, that happened a couple times. Also, it didn't feel that amazing; I didn't get much pleasure from it to be honest other than getting it in. That felt good though. 

Maybe it was because I was getting soft? I'm not sure. Maybe it was because it was my first time actually topping? I really don't want to think I'm some kind of exclusive bottom, I'm similar to him?

Any advice on this?

It's also bothers me we didn't get much done today. He couldn't top me today, I guess.

Edit: I also don't think I was doing a very good job topping. I m cut and 6.5 inches so I think I probably should have pulled out more when thrusting to stimulate my penis penis head more. Eh.

How should I approach this? I think I'm just going to ask him what he prefers.
