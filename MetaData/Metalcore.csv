Well guess what, here's the summary of these gigs:  
  
Warsaw (capitol city)- they didn't play. Apparently some guy who booked that show didn't show up on his own gig. Well, the band was really upset, because only about 10 people showed up, and allegedly they didn't get any money for the show. Let's say I was able to understand that they didn't want to play. Moving on.  

Wroclaw - they did a full, that not every band has to be a world class metal supergroup, but for fuck sake, Korea is NOWHERE near being big, not the mention being in the position to pick at LOCAL SUPPORTS.  

Bielsko Biala - The band didn't play. They decided that there weren't enough people for a proper show, making fun of the local bands, you know, the usual stuff. At this point I was starting to get really pissed, and needless to say, their reputation in Poland has reached the fucking ground. Therefore:  
  
Katowice - fucking ace in the hole. The Korea was the headliner for this show
- draw dicks and random shit with a sharpie on one of the supporting band's cars  
- Detune other band's instruments (WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?)  
- the vocalist got in a fight with a fan.  

Finally the crowd was so pissed
  
Now, all you can think is how to beat the shit out of him. But come FUCKING on! The KOREA even posted a facebook post about all these situations, and guess what? Almost everything is made up, and written in a way to show, that they are innocent. Want proof? All negative comments on their profile posted by dissapointed fans WERE IMMEDIATELY DELETED. 
   
Douchebag rockstar attidute, because they don't like the crowd, mocking local bands, destroying their property, FIGHTING their own fans, and lying to our faces afterwards. This is what THE KOREA is, and I don't care how good their music might be. I seriously doubt they will ever show up in Poland again
Now this is a shoutout and a fair warning to all of you guys - booking agents, be it in Europe or in the US. DON'T SUPPORT THE KOREA, or you might end up being dissapointed. If you feel like it, please share this story with your friends. That is all.

1365459605.0,1by4op,Guide to one of the best metalcore bands of all-time: As I Lay Dying,jglobal,127,18,51,"As I Lay Dying is one of my favorite bands of all-time and I consider them among the best metalcore bands. While not one of the founders of metalcore, starting from their first album. Enjoy!



**Beneath the Encasing of Ashes (2001)**
If you only know As I Lay Dying from their most recent work, this is not a perfect album and some songs start to sound the same. 



Top tracks: Beneath the Encasing of Ashes



**As I Lay Dying/American Tragedy Split (2002)**
This is more of an EP than an album



Top tracks: Forever



**Frail Words Collapse (2003)**
This is when As I Lay Dying started to become popular in the metalcore scene. Frail Words Collapse is definitely a classic metalcore album. The songwriting is just much better compared to their earlier work; the songs are able to be differentiated from each other and the album has a nice flow to it. The guitars while simple, I remember listening to 94 hours and the part when the double bass came in blew my mind. Tim Lambesis' vocals improve even more and he no longer sounds like Dan Weyandt. Overall, a great album. 



Top Tracks: 94 Hours



**Shadows Are Security (2005)**
As I Lay Dying really got popular after this album was released, and there is some actual singing in some of the songs, courtesy of Clint Norris, the bassist. Norris would leave the band soon after, but the singing would remain and become even more prominent in later albums. 
To me, but this album seems to be in the middle. Speaking of breakdowns, this album is chock-full of them, my favorites being the end of Through Struggle and the middle of Reflection.



Top Tracks: Confined



**A Long March: The First Recordings (2006)**
This is a compilation album, which is the same version from Shadows Are Security minus the intro, and Reinvention, which was released on this compilation for the first time.



Top Tracks: Reinvention(re-recorded)



**An Ocean Between Us (2007)**
To me, really come into their own here; there are more solos throughout, and the guitar work is much more complex than it was in the band's earlier albums. This is the point where the band started to shift to more metal-influenced metalcore. Sure there are still breakdowns and other hardcore elements, but it sounds so much different from their earlier albums; Within Destruction, for example, sounds like a thrash song in places. There are absolutely no duds here; from the opening riff of Separation to the piano-ending of This is Who We Are, this album shreds. I will give recommended tracks



Top Tracks: Nothing Left



**The Powerless Rise (2010)**
The Powerless Rise sounds like a continuation of An Ocean Between Us, but that's just because that album is ridiculously good. I will admit that there are a couple songs on The Powerless Rise that I didn't necessarily love (Without Conclusion and Condemned, if you want to know), whereas every song on An Ocean Between Us was great. Overall, a very good follow-up. 



Top Tracks: Anodyne Sea



**Decas (2011)**
Another compilation album, including Paralyzed, which might just be my favorite As I Lay Dying song ever. There are also 3 good covers, a medley of the song Beneath the Encasing of Ashes, and some remixes which I don't care for. Decas is worth it alone for the new songs, in my opinion, and the covers are pretty awesome as well.	



Top Tracks: Paralyzed



**Awakened (2012)**
This is As I Lay Dying's latest offering. The band chose to change a few things up this time around: Adam D, but the Bill Stevenson did a good job in his place. Also, it's a small thing, but this is the first studio album in a long time to not feature Jacob Bannon's awesome artwork, which is disappointing as a long-time fan. The sound is pretty similar to their last 2 albums, but in my opinion it's lacking something that I can't quite put my finger on. Some of the songs on Awakened are among the best of the band's career, yet there are a few that I do not care for at all, just not up to the high standards set by its predecessors.

**Something to note:  The ""Must-Hears"" at the end of each segment are not necessarily the most popular tracks on that album. Rather

Split CD with I Killed The Prom Queen / *Don’t Close Your Eyes* EP (2004)

The split CD with IKTPQ consisted of only two songs, which are a bit higher and looser than any other PWD album.  The raw tone of this EP makes it sound angry and dark, and many of the lyrics coincide with that tone.  It deals with death and hopelessness in a unique manner—the lyrics give the listener a sense of “me against the world”; I compare the writing in this album to that of a story about an anti-hero.  He is battered and broken, but will keep fighting simply out of anger and spite.  This tone and theme is extremely prominent in following works.  Even in the song “Don’t Close Your Eyes”, it addresses friendship and love in a uniquely dark but still positive way.

**Must-hears: “Smoke ‘Em If You Got ‘Em”, “The Cruise”**

*Killing With A Smile* (2005)

This album is what got me personally into metalcore.  It is crushingly powerful but blends melodic riffs and clean guitar into the music to perfectly compliment Winston’s voice.  I got hooked right away after listening to “Romance Is Dead”.  It also provided PWD with a more diverse fanbase and pushed them further into the Australian metalcore scene.  It is worth pointing out that this album is the best example of Winston’s voice as it transferred between the raw, giving this album a special tone to the music that, while present in following works, isn’t quite as prominent.  Song themes are very heavily based on lost love, pain and religion.  However, the overall theme of this album is exactly what the title suggests:  Killing with a smile.  It deals very cynically with attention-whores and the materialistic nature of modern society and suggests that they don't deserve to live if they are going to live in that way.  Several tracks feature snippets from popular movies, like Pirates Of The Caribbean and Die Hard that overlay the theme of the song.  
	

**Must-hears: “Romance Is Dead”

*Horizons* (2007)

*Horizons* was not only PWD’s international breakout album, bringing a cynical, angry perspective on modern society and its hollowness as well as revenge and personal struggle.  It reflects, many times, the writer’s desire to wipe out the entire world and start over fresh.  It heavily utilizes metaphorical language, especially referring to winter, snow and the cold (seriously, except in music form). 
	
**Must-Hears:  “Carrion”
^Seriously ^though

*Deep Blue* (2010)

*Deep Blue* was, shallow direction the modern world has taken, *Deep Blue* focuses on the inner struggles of a person lost in the same shallow world that KWAS and *Horizons* has depicted.  What I loved about this album is that it almost has a story-like quality to the lyrics.  **I know, I know, but hear me out on this one.**  As I said before, as you listen to each track, it gives you the impression that you are following a man through his life as he desperately tries to reconcile his personal anger and fury with the crushing pressure of the outside world to conform to the greed and indifference of the general populace.  It often implies that he wishes he were never born so that he didn’t have to undergo this battle and, turns inward, instead canonizing his own fury and lashing out against the world.  In this moment, of course

**Must-Hears:  “Sleepwalker”

*Atlas* (2012)

As *Deep Blue* was a mature, *Atlas* continued heading in that direction while still evolving the basic sound and tone of the music.  Containing more versatile sounds than previous albums, *Atlas* featured a very wide range of styling and tone, especially because they bring in several new mediums—notably a full string quartet, a female vocalist and trumpets—throughout the album.  You will also notice that there aren’t as many breakdowns in this album, instead substituting more melodic bridging and the afore-mentioned new musical mediums.  Thematic elements in this CD also varied greatly, addressing religion, love, I think, but I personally love the song “Atlas” for that exact reason:  It grapples with the distance and disconnection between the writer and his loved ones while acknowledging that he’s been working for his entire life to get here.  The line towards the end (“A thousand eyes stare back at me but the ones that I’d die for are the ones I can’t see”) gives me chills every single time.  I really want to just break down each song on this album because I have a lot to say about each of them individually

**Must-Hears:  “Dark Days”


I could go on and on about this band

 ***Looks Fragile After All*** (2004)

The bands first EP, being that he was not an experienced vocalist at the time of the recording. The rest of the band was very clearly more talented than him, and it shows in this EP. Hershey left the band shortly after the EP was released and was replaced by Josh McManness. The band signed with Solid State Records in 2005.

Key Songs: ""Accidental Shot Heard 'Round the World""

***Thrill Seeker*** (2005)

The bands initial full length album, and explosive drumming from Matt is what really drove this album. This album is the first big show of ABR's use of odd meters in their music. Audibly challenging to comprehend at first, this isn't your typical headbanger album. A beautiful blending of powerful breakdowns, mind blowing riffs, and confusing, bizarre meters, *Thrill Seeker* was an album unlike any so far in the genre. The complexity of this album takes more than one listen to fully take in. The instrumentals still vastly overshadow the vocals, and from there they toured non-stop.

Key Songs: ""Speech Impediment"", ""The Seventh Trumpet""

***Messengers*** (2007)

This is the first ABR album I heard, and the new vocals were a huge piece that was gained in *Messengers*. When you thought JB couldn't write anything more complex than before, he blows you away in the first song of the album (""The Truth of a Liar""). Matt steps it up as well, laying down some of the most rhythmically complex drumming you will ever see or hear. Jake brought to the band something they were dearly missing, powerful vocals. Till this point, the band had the instrumental talent, but lacked the vocal power they needed. Jake was the gunpowder they got, and many consider it to be ABR's best album to date. I find it hard to disagree

Key Songs: ""Back Burner"", ""An American Dream"", ""The Truth Of A Liar""

***Lost Messengers: The Outtakes*** (2009)

An EP released after extensive touring following *Messengers*, it included two demos from *Messengers*, as well as their version of ""Carol of the Bells"". It's one of the lesser known releases of the band, with the exception of ""Carol"", and is quite underrated. It shows a much more ""metal"" side to the band, and is definitely worth a listen.

Key Songs: ""Carol of the Bells""

***Constellations*** (2009)

To me, his parts would sometimes sound a little broken, or forced. Matt really stepped it up in this album, and this is definitely my favorite of his album performances. I also feel that this is a shining point for Jake's vocals in the band. It finally feels like Jake is leading the band in this album. His vocals were powerful in *Messengers*, but here, they blow away the listener. The band as whole feels more powerful in this album, as well as some new intricacies with the guitars, clean guitar and drum ""breakdown"". This is a huge shift for a band in this genre

Key Songs: ""White Washed"", ""Rationalist""

***Leveler*** (2011)

...starts with ""Empire"", even though on the surface, everything looks okay, underneath something is very, very wrong. Though it may not be considered to be the best of their albums to date, it marks a distinct change in the band. In *Leveler*, they make a full departure from traditional ""mainstream"" metalcore. Not only do they bring back the combination of clean and distorted guitars, bringing a new flavor to metalcore. One that is more worldly

Key Songs: ""Empire"", ""Carpe Diem"", ""Poor Millionaire""

**New Album** (2013-2014)

The band is currently in the process of recording their fifth full length album. JB was quoted as saying that their new album will ""...push the boundaries of our genre more than we ever have before. We set out to write a record where every song stands out from the last. There is a lot of ground covered here and a ton of meat to this album. It’s full of odd metered rhythms and breakdowns, but this will be our most ambitious album yet.""



I know I left out *Home* and *Sleddin' Hill*

*Home* is a live album done by the band in 2010

*Sleddin' Hill* is a fully instrumental holiday album done by the band in 2012. It's a 13 song album comprised entirely of interpretations of famous Christmas songs

Right now I'm having a musical crisis, any perspective on this would be much appreciated.

I feel like the climate of metalcore is turning into one of pure attention-seeking, conformity, groupies, hair, and maybe the music as an afterthought.

I think the instrumentals are good example of the regression that's happening. It seems in order to attain praise, the easiest technique there is on the guitar. Seriously, 6 months of effort and you are on par with most of the guitarists that are in the spotlight. This speaks to a lot of kids I think. The genre began turning itself into something that every fan has a chance of achieving. 

Vocally

""We are the promised ones and nothing's in our way
They can try but they'll never stop us.""

Just one example

The live shows also demonstrate that desire for instant gratification. It's about the attention, bands had to rely on their live sound to gain notoriety. Now, it seems the opposite is the case.

It just seems like there is an elephant in the room which never gets addressed. People fly off the handle about a band that does a decent breakdown

Maybe I'm just pessimistic. Maybe I'm totally wrong about everything. I have loved this genre for 15 years

EDIT: u/xBBTx posted an incredibly eloquent and poignant article that touches on the very thing we have been discussing in here. I encourage any of you to give it a glance (http://myrandomcontemplations.wordpress.com/2013/06/04/the-belgian-scene/ ). But here's an excerpt which speaks volumes to me:

""I often get this feeling that bands are unsatisfied because they feel like they deserve better. There’s an unshakeable conclusion I draw from most of these bands, NOTHING is owed to any of us. Music is a field where you take your chances, and lay it all on the line. There are no guarantees for making it anywhere, but let’s be clear: The ONLY reason you SHOULD be a band is because you love playing music. If you’re intent is to become “big” then your intentions aren’t pure, and your music probably isn’t honest either.""

Now, but because I was just always listening to something else, and never got around to it. 

I have a hard time getting into a concert while a band is playing that I'm not familiar with the songs. Im the type of person that loves singing along, so I only have a great time when I'm seeing a band I enjoy with songs I recognize (with the exception of it being a band I really like yet they're playing a new/unreleased song, that I can get into as well). 

With that said, and I'm so glad I did as I was completely blown away. Despite not knowing any song they played, I found myself moving to the music and enjoying every bit of it. I'm sad to now realize that I didn't listen to their stuff earlier so I could have possibly enjoyed the show even more than I did last night, but there's always next time. 

So just wanted to rave about ABR for a moment I guess, I have to say, go see them live if anything. They put on such an amazing show I walked out of that concert almost enjoying them more than I did Silverstein who is one of my favorite bands. Also, I plan on buying all their other albums in the next couple of days so any suggestions on what I ""need"" to listen to first, let me know!

Often I have heard much dispute over the effects of cigarette smoking on scream vocals. I've heard some people come to claim so much that their screams sound better because they smoke, because part of the rockstar lifestyle so often involves drinking, drugs, smoking, etc. Though I'll never advocate drug use, this is not specifically anti-drug. This is a warning to those of you, who are prospective/practicing screamers

For example, for years, or unless they smoke upwards of a pack a day for long periods of time. Also, the distortion is really non-existent in the sounds of aiding your screams. Intense vocals can be achieved (and have been achieved) without any use of cigarettes, and this can be proven in countless examples of straight-edge (or not necessarily straight-edge, but at least screamers that haven't smoked cigarettes regularly) vocalists with outstanding vocals, and even they would admit that smoking cigarettes, is harmful to performance

This also is not meant in particular to be anti-smoking. I don't mean to come off as the wise above-all guru waggling my finger down at you who do smoke but hope to be a vocalist. I just mean to show you the inaccuracy of such claims. You can take examples of famous vocalists that do smoke or did smoke

For example, and tone-wise, from the post-With Roots/pre-Zombie time of the band. The most recent release from TDWP, two years later, was the live album Dead &amp; Alive, where [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSHUD-4mz_c) his voice sounds much more weary and shot. I understand that this was one of the last concerts of their tour, but also does not negate Mike's clearly-lacking performance in contrast to previous energy. His voice cuts short several signature screams in the song. You can especially tell in his performance of the opening song from the first concert link I gave you, if you are not one of them

This is because smoking cigarettes does not affect the tone of your screams, physicality is important for stage presence, and being able to use your full lung capacity when powerfully screaming night after night is essential.

I don't mean for the focus to be directed solely at Mike Hranica. You can see this in performers like Jonny Craig, not everybody that I mention I am fans of, I use them for examples). Some performers do manage to pull it off, though I'd assume it would be a much easier job without the extra work your lungs are having to do, with less access to oxygen.

Even if you do not want to be a performer, just as much as a touring musician would. Again, I would like to stress that the aim of this is focused on cigarettes, and less on marijuana, even though the affects are less severe, the tar in marijuana still will affect your lungs as a studio vocalist, still yet not nearly as badly as cigarette-smoking damages your performance. Because of the countless amount of professionals who are open in recreational marijuana use, but that is another discussion. Smoking neither would be ideal, or the good thing to do as a screamer.

To address the defense re. the rockstar lifestyle, because their job is just as physical if not more physical than any of their band members' jobs) doesn't negate the argument. The singer has a directly vocal-related job, and with the stresses of screaming, the intensity and demand for optimal lung capacity is critical. The guitar-player doesn't have to scream and jump around and engage the audience nearly as much as the singer does, night after night, and doesn't have to preserve his vocal ability and treat his voice to deal with touring. 
Apples are different than oranges; step down from your horse and join the twenty-first century.

**TL;DR** So just in case you're thinking that starting to smoke will help you be a better vocalist, it will make your vocals (or their potential ability if you haven't started yet) worse.",,False,self,t5_2rfut,1367377136.0,,

In the future, that will be sooner rather than later. So I'm just plugging a local festival hoping someone will be awesome enough to help out and spread the word :) 

AND. if you're in a band that would want to play this festival


I hope to see this festival grow to the point where it's not just local anymore. I want it to come to the point where it becomes a concert tour with huge headliners like As I Lay Dying and Killswitch. This is me doing my part to spread the word.

For the purpose of this guide, which you should definitely check out, I feel like the full releases should get the spotlight.


**This Is What the Edge of Your Seat Was Made For (2004):** Heavy and chaotic are definitely two words I would use to describe BMTH's first EP. It delivers an abrasive mix of deathcore (which was just picking up steam as this came out), technicality, anger and overall messy sound BMTH achieves here. A pissed off record from pissed off teenagers which put BMTH on the radar, and laid the foundation for their next album.

Notable tracks: [Rawwwrr!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEeky9agc2g&amp;list=PL35FB590D50EC4F9F)


**Count Your Blessings (2006):** BMTH's debut, when it was just death metal and metalcore, and nu-metal wasn't in the mix at all). Breakdowns are definitely the star of the show here, and they are as heavy as they are numerous. Oli's vocals, as well as the whole band, get a much needed polish, and the instrumentation takes a slightly less mathcore turn. While the band have said that this is their least favorite album, rather than about making great songs

Notable Tracks: [Pray for Plagues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWggPLXeOkU)


**Suicide Season (2008):** This is BMTH's bridging album, often accompanied by catchy riffs. Breakdowns still live, and they don't shy away from getting very heavy. Oli's vocals (which people were piiiiiissed about) get very much more metalcore, as he yells his way through most of the record, compared to showing off his range on CYB. Aside from that, I think that the guitar work on this album, which shows off the band's Slipknot influence, and emphasizes quality rather than technical quantity. Electronics are also brought in in this release, I believe that this would be it. It provides a nice mix of their different sounds throughout the years

Notable Tracks: [Chelsea Smile](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWiGrO1-hxk), [Suicide Season](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLkgO3N6blM)



**There is a Hell, creating musical textures that complement the heavy riffs and pounding drums. Jona Weinhofen also makes an appearance on guitar, which many believe pushed the band to take the extra steps toward their own sound. As a whole, this record is a lot slower and more melodic than past releases, but is not without some very heavy, scrappy tracks. [LIGHTS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5S1QxF-a6Y) lends her voice a few times on the album, giving the songs a softer female component. Oli's voice doesn't change much, this album deals more with Oli's personal issues, yet polished and professional sound

Notable Tracks: [Crucify Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2_VVAmprxU), [Blessed With A Curse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dH9Cyu51WdM)


**Sempiternal (2013):** The most recent, *Sempiternal* truly perfects the sound that the band was moving towards. Full of melody and depth, added in part by the inclusion of Jordan Fish, a proper keyboard player/programmer, each song on the album is incredibly catchy and well-written. (I know I'm raving a bit on this one). The instrumentation is fairly simply, a complete antithesis to BMTH's older albums, and the focus is definitely placed on showing off with good songs, coupled with Oli's ""cleaner"" vocals, making them a whole lot more dynamic. Singing is used again on this album, whether they like metal or not.

Notable Tracks: Honestly

**Patterns of a Horizon

POAH is a raw demo that showcases the band’s early style. Every song that appears on this demo was re-recorded for Dear Love: A Beautiful Discord with minor lyrical and musical changes. The song that sounds the most different is Swords, which I linked below. This was the first album Joey Sturgis produced and Mike Hranica was 16 years old when he laid down the vocals. There are very few hard copies in existence; if you have one, I’d love to buy it from you! 

Key tracks: [Swords

**Dear Love: A Beautiful Discord

Dear Love is essentially POAH, Dear Love sounds like nothing that TDWP has released since. The rawness and emotion conveyed by the band here makes it a must-listen for all true TDWP fans. I would argue that this is their most melodic album, and is definitely not your typical Rise-core album. Yesterday I said that AILD’s 94 Hours was one of two songs that got me into this genre. Dogs Can Grow Beards All Over is the other. This is the album that James Baney had the most influence on; his keyboard takes center stage multiple times throughout the album. Unfortunately, the band doesn’t play any of these songs live often anymore.

Key tracks: Dogs Can Grow Beards All Over; Swords

**Plagues, Victory Records**

This is the album that TDWP became a heavy hitter in this genre. DePoyster’s singing improved greatly for this album, mostly in his deeps. This album has some really great breakdowns, such as the one in The Scorpion Deathlock. The most underrated song by the band is also in this album, Reptar, King of the Ozone. Craig Owens of Chiodos appears in You Can’t Spell “Crap” Without the “C”. Plagues also had great commercial success, peaking at #57 on the Billboard 200 and two songs, Hey John, made the Rock Band video game series. Joey Sturgis produced this album as well.

Key Tracks: HTML Rulez D00d; Hey John

**With Roots Above and Branches Below

If Plagues launched TDWP into popularity, the album was a monster. I remember sitting in my first hour class in 9th grade listening to the album the day it came out for the first time; to this day, the album feels fresh and exciting. WRAABB is definitely my favorite album. Danger: Wildman features a then-16 year old Trevor Wentworth (Our Last Night) trading screams with Hranica. Assistant to the Regional Manager raises the hair on your neck with its guitars. Louder Than Thunder helped the band reach yet another new audience. Lord Xenu is an absolute monster to finish the album. I’m really out of words to describe how much I love this album. If you haven’t sat down and listened to this album yet, all I can say is that you’ve been missing out. WRAABB hit #11 on the Billboard 200 and #1 on the Top Independent, Top Hard Rock, and Top Christian charts. Joey Sturgis produced yet another TDWP album.

Key Tracks: Assistant to the Regional Manager; Danger:Wildman; Lord Xenu

**Zombie EP

Zombie EP is hands down the heaviest music that TDWP has written. Hranica’s vocal technique changed a little for this EP, brings three massive breakdowns in under five minutes. The second song must be more chill, right? NO! The sound of a chainsaw lets everyone know that Anatomy was here to rip your eardrums out. Outnumbered, not to be outdone, begins with an ominous PSA that quickly turns into a fast paced three minutes of desperation and epicness. Revive begins with a nasty guitar riff that drops into some heavy chords and vocals. This song also has one of my favorite choruses by DePoyster (“we cannot restore/we cannot recover/all is lost in the flood of the risen dead”). Survivor finishes with Hranica telling about the few remaining survivors of the zombie apocalypse. This EP was recorded in under a month and was produced by Joey Sturgis. Zombie hit #10 on the Billboard 200. Nothing gets you in the mood for slaying zombies (or really anything, for the matter) like these 23 minutes of sheer brutality.

Key tracks: Escape; Outnumbered

**Dead Throne, Roadrunner**

Thought by most as a letdown after the Zombie EP’s greatness, but that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t have its moments. Hranica’s viciousness in Vengeance and Born to Lose turns any live show into a pitting frenzy. Tim Lambesis (AILD) also lent his anger to the end of Constance. TDWP also channeled their inner Underoath with Kansas and Chicago. Adam Dutkiewicz (Killswitch Engage) produced this album, breaking Sturgis’ stranglehold on the band. Dead Throne reached #10 on the Billboard 200, #1 on the Christian and Independent charts, as well as #40 on the 2011 year-end Hard Rock Albums chart. If I had to describe this album, it would call Dead Throne a mixture of the quick and heavy pacing of Zombie and the melodic elements of WRAABB. 

Key tracks: RIT; Mammoth; Chicago; Born to Lose

**Dead &amp; Alive, Roadrunner**

This is a CD/DVD combo that features 16 live recordings from the band from a March 8, but the quality is great and it is the last time James Baney is featured on any TDWP record. Definitely worth a look IMHO.

Key tracks: Kansas; Dogs Can Grow Beards All Over; Mammoth

**New Album**

TDWP’s fifth album is set to be released sometime this fall through Roadrunner Records. Matt Goldman is set to be the producer, while on their most recent tour with As I Lay Dying. Hranica has said that the album will be darker than Dead Throne, both musically and lyrically.

So lets get this started:

**1. Name your favorite band.** Or favorite band at the moment, they are similar to, so people can get a feel for the style of their music. I know comparing bands is frowned upon sometimes, but let's face it, metalcore can be very diverse, and this helps new listeners identify a sound they like.

**2. Tell us what makes this band awesome.** Every band has a thing, or a unique composition style. Brag about why you think this band is one of the best.

**3. Post a youtube link to their best work, ""Dude listen to the breakdown at 1:37"", etc. Talk about why this song is awesome in your book or gives you the chills every time you listen to it.

**Affiance** - Fuck man, with every song! It's to bad that so many people weren't there to check em out, really missing out when people don't get to a show to see the openers. The singer was taking pictures with people afterwards and just walking around talking with people for the rest of the night. Some of the other members were hanging out around the merch area as well. I honestly felt like I was the only one belting out the lyrics to these guys, which was kind of unfortunate. Waiting for everyone to yell ""GET UP OFF THE GROUND!"" except no one knew it was coming, kinda sucked, oh well, fuck em. My voice was pretty much blown after them haha.

*Setlist*

Kings of Deceit

Piece of Mind

You Will Be Replaced

We The Machines

Call of the Warrior

Pretty sure that was all of them


**The Word Alive** - For me personally, since As I Lay Dying couldn't make it out on this tour, they decided to do a cover of one of their songs. They picked **94 Hours**. Holy. Fuck. Me and this guy next to me looked at each other and were like ""FUUUUCK YEAH!"". It was crazy. Nice circle pit going for that song.

*Setlist - incomplete*

2012

Epiphany (i think.. don't hold me to it)

94 Hours

Evolutions

Life Cycles

One or two others maybe.. they had about a 30-40 minute set.

**Darkest Hour** - Fuck yeah! Seeing these guys was fuckin crazy! I overheard some kids saying ""I've never listened to these guys"" and whatever

*Setlist - incomplete*

Doomsayer (SO SIIIIIICK)

Love As A Weapon

Violent by Nature

Savior the Kill

The Sadist Nation

Again

**Miss May I** I never listened to these guys much before going to this show. But goddamn

*Setlist - incomplete*

Hey Mister

Relentless Chaos

Forgive and Forget

Opening Wounds

Bleeding Out (i think)

Sorry, the younger crowd really got into them. I'll DEFINITELY listen to them more often, holy shit, they did a great job. Fuck yeah.

**KILLSWITCH ENGAGE** - Here we go. Clearly everyone was here to see these guys absolutely annihilate the place. I got right up to the front, there were a TON of chicks on the floor. This was my 4th time seeing Killswitch and its always funny to see how many more fans they have and how diverse the crowd gets. The first time I saw them open up for In Flames and Dark Tranquility you wouldn't have seen a chick there, now adays it's like 30% chicks. Well anyway, anyone who's ever been to a show, especially a Killswitch show, knows that before hand is a calm before the storm. I felt bad for the girls because it was a straight fucking bumrush as soon as KSE came on, almost all of the girls left after the first 2 songs, usual antics from Killswitch

*Setlist*

This Hell In Me

The New Awakening

Beyond the Flames

In Due Time

All We Have (fuck yeah

No End In Sight

Numbered Days

Self-Revolution

Fixation on the Darkness

My Last Serenade

Life to Lifeless

The Arms of Sorrow

This is Absolution

Take this Oath

A Bid Farewell (i think? for some reason i can't 100% remember this one)

Rose of Sharyn

The End of Heartache

My Curse

Only one thing really kinda disappointed me about this show, not one song. No Temple, no In The Unblind, no Vide. Eh, just kinda sucked being a fan of the band since the beginning, was really hoping for one.

**Conclusion** - Get out and see this fucking tour you guys. It's an incredible line up and you'll meet some cool ass people. Beers for $5.50 for a pint. Can't complain. You'll be deaf as fuck

TL;DR - Go read fucker. Crazy ass tour. Epic as shit. Fuck YEAH METAL!",self,t5_2rfut,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/1fzf5s/saw_kse_mmi_darkest_hour_twa_and_affiance_last/

Let's have a discussion on the importance of the history, definition, and varieties of metalcore.",lotkrotan,49,38, and participating the punk/metal/hardcore/whatever bands for over a decade now, so I welcome your input

To me the [metalcore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalcore) genre itself is as broad of a term as Punk or Rock. My understanding of the criteria of a metalcore band is that it mixes the aggression and rhythm of punk with compositions associated with metal. It also may or may not incorporate riffs designed for crowd reactions ([breakdowns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL5azV8bE64), [mosh calls](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mosh+callout), etc). If you trace back the roots of punk and metal, the first merging of the styles was considered ""[hardcore punk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_punk)"" or ""[thrash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_metal)"" or ""[crossover](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_thrash)."" Hardcore was a lot of punk with a little metal influence, thrash and crossover being more metal than punk.

Then comes the early 90s with bands like [Earth Crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Crisis), hissed, [Carcass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcass_%28band%29)-inspired high vocals can still be heard in most metalcore bands today and have inspired legions of deathcore, prog, and other forms of metal bands.

To me, and crossover were narrow in their scope and didn't allow for much variation from the accepted standards of the genre. Metalcore opened up new ways to incorporate punk beats, speed picking, solos, and harmonies for a fresh sound.

Some bands like [Ringworm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringworm_%28band%29) or [Strife](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strife_%28band%29) are considered metalcore even though compared to today's offerings they seem more Thrash or Hardcore oriented. Back in the early days of metalcore they stuck out like a sore thumb compared to the strictly hardcore or thrash offerings of their contemporaries.

This early era of metalcore can see it's influence in later staples in the genre such as [As I Lay Dying](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_I_Lay_Dying_%28band%29), there was another shift in the genre in the late 90s.

When bands like [Coalesce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalesce_%28band%29), these newer bands were taking the accepted sonic qualities of metalcore and incorporating noise, ambient, and even jazz to produce more complexly timed riffs, chaotic dissonance, and intricate progressions. The term “[mathcore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathcore)” was born and I'd like to think these early underground offerings paved the way for more successful “[math rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_rock)” bands to come later.

This is probably my favorite style of metalcore and quite possibly laid the ground work for the influx of [progressive metal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_metal)/metalcore in the 2000s. Some of the more successful bands along the lines of this shift in trends include [Daughters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daughters_%28band%29), [Every Time I Die](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Time_I_Die), [Curl Up and Die](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_Up_and_Die), and [Breather Resist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breather_Resist).

While some bands in the genre were pushing the limits of what a metalcore band is, and Metal. Bands like [Full Blown Chaos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Blown_Chaos), [Sworn Enemy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sworn_Enemy), and [Black My Heart](http://us.myspace.com/blackmyheart) kept churning out songs with crushing breakdowns and hardcore/thrash influenced riffs.

Also appearing on the scene at this time was an influx of more melodic metalcore, and undistorted guitars. The genre of [Post-Hardcore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-hardcore) was going strong and metalcore bands started to incorporate it into their sound. [Poison the Well](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_the_Well_%28band%29) is probably the closest thing to a forerunner for this variation in metalcore with bands such as [From Autumn to Ashes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Autumn_to_Ashes) and [Chiodos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiodos) continuing the trend.

Another example of the branching out of metalcore is the [southern rock style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWAgwPKsUiw) incorporated namely by Every Time I Die and imitated by bands as far ranging as [Maylene and the Sons of Disaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maylene_and_the_Sons_of_Disaster) to modern namesakes like [Vanna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanna_%28band%29). While not a huge shift in style

While there definitely are still bands making metalcore today, [Despised Icon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Chord), [Ed Gein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Gein_%28band%29), [Killwhitneydead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killwhitneydead), etc. Nowadays people consider those bands [Deathcore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathcore), but at the time the label didn't exist.

While some metalcore bands were becoming more and more like deathcore, or Avenged Sevenfold, you conjure thoughts of clean hooks mixed with heavy breakdowns. This style of metalcore most likely influenced modern heavyweights like [Protest the Hero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest_the_Hero) and [Periphery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periphery_%28band%29).

Nowadays progressive metal bands are as common as ever, progressive metal became a genre of it's own rather than a handful of bands inside the realms of metal and metalcore. I do want to add that metalcore alone didn't pave the way for progressive metal and credit is due to bands like [Neurosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis_%28band%29), [Mastodon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_%28band%29), and [Cynic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_%28band%29) for being way ahead of their time.

Fast forward to today and metalcore is certainly a dying genre, or Deathcore without the foundation metalcore created? How would the recent influx of [melodic hardcore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodic_hardcore) bands like [Defeater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeater_%28band%29) or brutal pop-punk bands like [Four Year Strong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Year_Strong) or [A Day To Remember](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Day_To_Remember) have come to be without the example set by the more melody-laden metalcore bands of the past?

I wouldn't say there was a start or end of metalcore. It was birthed by experimentation and pushing boundaries, [Trustkill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_Records), [Ferret](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferret_Records), and [Deathwish Inc.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathwish_Inc.) produced some of the best albums in the genre.

Like I said at the beginning

**TL;DR** Metalcore started as a blending of punk and metal

**TL;DR2** Metalcore is more important to music than most people realize


**edit** I think I should make a mention of how youth-driven the culture is, political, and religious points of view. 

It'd also be worth mentioning that the thrill and energy of live metalcore bands is one of the most positive experiences I've ever had with large groups of people. There's a sense of danger and adrenaline in the pit while at the same time an unspoken code of ethics to pick up fallen moshers or crowd surfers so they don't get stomped. There's unity and community present in every gang vocal or sing along, merely channeling it instead. The crowd has the power to bring the energy to huge levels, and it's an almost supernatural experience.

**edit 2** Thanks for all the input so far guys! I added some context links so people can look up references to bands/terms they aren't familiar with.",self,t5_2rfut,1354580956.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/147ndd/metalcore_has_been_unjustly_pigeonholed_and/
