1367783606.0,1dqwp0,[Announcement] Introducing the Tech Support MacGyver Awards! We want input from the community!,Ihmhi,51,7,4,"A few days ago

Here's the result.

We are going to be introducing five new awards for Tech Support Macgyver posts. Winners will announced monthly and forever earn a place in the TSMG Hall of Fame. Winners will get special flair for their username

The awards are not mutually exclusive (you can win multiple awards with one post if we think you're the best fit for that award)

You don't have to be the person who actually made or created the mod. We'd *love* to see TSMG subscribers posting stuff that *they* did

Having said all that

&amp;nbsp;

**Best Junkyard Engineering:** Best post that works but doesn't look pretty. Securing hardware with duct tape &amp; wires, bent &amp; cut metal. It doesn't have to look pretty - it just has to work.

**Best Unintended Use of a Product:** Using an object for something it was not intended for (such as using a rubber band as a fan belt

**Most Professionally Built:** A mod or repair that's so well done it could have come off of the shelf at a computer store.

**Most Spectacular Failure:** A project that didn't quite work as intended. In fact

**Golden Paperclip Award:** The simplest

&amp;nbsp;

We will be taking commentary on this new system, May 8th at 11:59PM EDT**. If you have questions, concerns, criticism, commentary, or ideas, post them here.

Ladies and gentlemen

[This is my molly guard](http://imgur.com/8pWpLsQ).  A Sears shopper's card.

There's a reason it has this placed here.  My cats - Lina and Zelgadis - are rather intelligent.  This

They know how to turn it off.  At least

Now to explain these two cats, either an Abyssinian or a Siamese.  (It's generally some sort of domestic cat that they are bred with.)  The genetic structure is not really relevant to this, but Wikipedia can tell you more.  They tend to come off as rather talkative, being involved with their humans, and particularly clever.  Zel, however, is an enigma - she is an odd, which is pretty much one of a kind in Bengals, for lack of a better name of her game

Anyway. 

Once upon a time, I'm tooling around, and next thing I know, bamf, everything pops off with a click, and I hear a small, kitten-like ""meow"" from under my desk.  

I didn't think this was possible, and it was fine.  

Until she did it again.  I watched her stomp on that switch.  

That problem got solved fairly easily.  Duct tape and the plastic blister pack from a package of Rayovac batteries that my ex was using for her portable CD player.  Problem solved.

Well, but that's another story.  I still have Lina and Zelgadis.

About two years ago, [this case](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811108230) is what I own.  The old power strip had long since been replaced with a 350 vA UPS, which I later upgraded to a 1 KvA (when I learned the hard way that, in the event of power failure, you really want a UPS that's bigger than your PSU).   The power and reset buttons live on the top, beneath this card, which is taped onto the case with packing tape. 

She has yet to figure out that I only taped the top edge, while Lina curls up in the crook of my left arm.  I do not expect that she'll figure it out, because she's figured out that, if she sits in my lap, I'll give her attention.  

tl;dr: (in Prof. Farnsworth's voice) I've done it!  I have made something that is cat proof!

So it is six at night

Mom: ""1000kai

So I go over like the great son I am and help my mom.

Me: Are you connected to our wireless network?

Her: No...

Me: Ok

Her: It is GONE!

So I pull out my iPod and have a look. Yup

I head over to the room where I have my computer and our modem and router. As I walk in I immediately know bad things have happened! The air smells kind of tangy/acidic and our nice Cisco E4200 has no lights on. I unplug it and our cable modem for half a minute and then plug them back in. The modem boots but our router looks like a roadkill kitten; sad and really dead.

Here is the deal

I have a spare router kicking around but it has no antennas. (I cut them off

Upon seeing the routers motherboard I at first think I am screwed. One out of the seven caps on it has popped and begun to leak! crap Why me?

Then I start thinking. Out of my limited soldering experience I once replaced a capacitor on a old 478 board. It would be the same thing to replace a capacitor on our router

To the workshop! First, the only difference is color. [1]

The de-soldering from the spare part and mounting of the capacitor goes of with out a hitch! I reassemble the E4200 and head back inside. [2]

The moment we have all been waiting for is here

TL;DR Our router breaks and then I live up to my title of ""ub3r 1337 h4cx0r grandmaster of technology"".

Things will keep running as they have so far

We've also added four more subreddits to our Promoted subreddits. Here's the breakdown of what and why.

&amp;nbsp;

**/r/techsupport, this whole community was started by a [silly little post](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupportgore/comments/xs12e/cousin_used_a_golf_tee_and_super_glue_to_fix_his/c5p6slh) made in /r/techsupportgore. /u/Ugbrog made the comment, /u/Stewartspicer created the subreddit, and I (/u/Ihmhi) made the first post. (/u/Rapptz and /u/appropriate-username jumped on the team quickly enough and have been super cool folks!)

In that sense

&amp;nbsp;

**/r/DIY** is similar in spirit to a lot of the things we do here. Why hire somebody else when you can do it yourself?

&amp;nbsp;

**/r/gamephysics** was here for a while as a promoted subreddit. The bureacrat in me says it was probably there for a good reason so I'm leaving it there.

My company does computer refreshes for schools every summer

It was about 2 months when she asked all the techies under my manager Bob

I take a look at the company's imaging solution right now. Which is Clonezilla

So after a few minutes I had a script to get all the baseline software installed etc. It did it all automatically with a hue of green front on a black terminal. I felt proud.

So while I'm doing all the prep work with the RPis; Bob asks if I had given any thought to the imac debacle. We can't have 1500 imacs with school data still on them sitting in our warehouse.

I then get the idea of using our own imaging software CloneyZ to somehow brick them. I knew it was far fetched but I decided to give it a try. Only issue is imacs don't have a PXE boot function (Typical apple)

So I let it sit percalating for a couple of week while I went about my usual other tasks. They send me out to client sites for site support from 8:30 to 1pm every day. The afternoon I'm at the office working on various projects


I then had a revelation as if it just came to me. Grab an image of a Raspi OS

My first initial test proved well. However I tested it on my laptop in which I was building the solution. So all my notes and files I had saved were essentially lost within the 3 minutes it took me to push a 2GB image to my own machine. 


Oh well no biggie just some scripts I can rewrite later

Fast forward 2 more weeks. Its time to present my findings. At this point it was a very sloppy design requiring 2 flash drives just to kill an imac. Bob said do better.

Eventually I got it slimmed up to one. And even wrote a fancy one liner script to be saved on the flash drive. That will auto accept any y/n messages

As I type this


I feel like an evil genius.


TL;DR Guns aren't evil

Let's get started with the tour.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

###New Design

&amp;nbsp;

**Header**

A brand new header has been made from a composite of some of the latest and most aesthetically pleasing and/or horrifying TSMG posts. Liked the old header? [Here's an Imgur link for posterity.](http://imgur.com/aQU9byC)

I took special care to include a big honking red fan right at the top left because I know how much /u/Stewartspicer loves fan posts.

If you are on a horizontal resolution of less than 1920 pixels

&amp;nbsp;

**Sidebar**

Further enhancing the TSMG experience is a pretty header image. TSMG 2.0 means *twice* the Macgyver! Bonus internet points to whomever can identify what sort of computer Macgyver is using and what episode this particular picture is from.

&amp;nbsp;

**Mail Icon**

The drab

&amp;nbsp;

**Link Flair**

Winning posts of the monthly TSMG Awards will be distinguished with special link flair. This will make the links stand out a bit more!

The awards will be explained in more detail further down the post; for now

* [Best Junkyard Engineering](http://i.imgur.com/TOmQ15j.png)
* [Best Unintended Use of a Product](http://i.imgur.com/FA2TJoS.png)
* [Most Professionally Built](http://i.imgur.com/AC3kyFU.png)
* [Most Spectacular Failure](http://i.imgur.com/mCrqFDx.png)
* [Golden Paperclip Award](http://i.imgur.com/WeIWNlM.png)

&amp;nbsp;

**User Flair**

We wouldn't be much of a subreddit without our (at the time of this writing) 13

As thanks to those of you who submit content to TSMG

* [Nifty Paperclip User Flair](http://i.imgur.com/05TJqD0.png)

Furthermore

Before I go into detail about how it *will* work

I *wanted* to be able to just add multiple user flairs to people as well as duplicates of those flairs. So, and Most Professionally Built Award would have those images next to their name. Hovering over those images would show you the month and year the award was won, and clicking on that particular piece of flair would take you to that post.

Unfortunately

^Also ^I ^hate ^link ^flair.

I personally spend something on the order of 36-40 hours trying to figure out how to get it to work. I went through dozens of /r/csshelp posts. I talked with people. I uploaded a picture of a paperclip and rubbed it against the stylesheet.css for good luck. Unfortunately

The solution is this: we're going to go with a simple ""Star"" system. Here's some examples:

* [1 Award Received](http://i.imgur.com/UFQMtpS.png)

* [6 Awards Received](http://i.imgur.com/dtDzhP9.png)

* [10 Awards Received](http://i.imgur.com/D6Vwvsl.png)

Now

We'll be using the (currently bare-bones) [Tech Support Macgyver Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupportmacgyver/wiki/index) to show who has won which awards each month. We'll make sure it's set up in all kinds of nice ways so you can see all the winners of a particular award or all of the awards a particular user has won. This will take some time to set up properly and may not be implemented by the end of this month.

&amp;nbsp;

**Fancy-pants Subreddit Name**

The subreddit name is now displayed in a prettier and much more fancy-pantsier style.

&amp;nbsp;

**Same Ol' Ugly Reddit Logo**

This will likely change in the future. After kicking butt on the header, you'll get a nifty little credit on the sidebar for being so super awesome.

^^Seriously ^^I ^^hate ^^link ^^flair ^^40 ^^hours ^^of ^^on ^^and ^^off ^^coding ^^down ^^the ^^drain...

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

###The Tech Support Macgyver Awards

&amp;nbsp;

We're officially announcing the launch of The Tech Support Macgyver Awards. Every month

&amp;nbsp;

[**Best Junkyard Engineering**](http://i.imgur.com/TOmQ15j.png)

Best post that works but doesn't look pretty. Securing hardware with duct tape &amp; wires, bent &amp; cut metal. It doesn't have to look pretty - it just has to work. Success is optional - it's about the appearance and the attempt more so than it actually working.

&amp;nbsp;

[**Best Unintended Use of a Product**](http://i.imgur.com/FA2TJoS.png)

Using an object for something it was not intended for (such as using a rubber band as a fan belt

&amp;nbsp;

[**Most Professionally Built**](http://i.imgur.com/AC3kyFU.png)

A mod or repair that's so well done it could have come off of the shelf at a computer store. Alienware could sell your computer at an insane markup to readers of PC Magazine.

&amp;nbsp;

[**Most Spectacular Failure**](http://i.imgur.com/mCrqFDx.png)

A project that didn't quite work as intended. In fact, horribly wrong anyway.)

&amp;nbsp;

[**Golden Paperclip Award**](http://i.imgur.com/WeIWNlM.png)

The simplest

&amp;nbsp;

There they are. Now onto the awards process.

First and foremost

Secondly, but they will be ineligible for any and all future awards. Any TSMG mods who have submitted a post will, however, get that neato little paperclip next to their names. We simply cannot involve the chance of mods winning awards due to obvious bias and conflict of interest, so it will never happen.

We are not going to require any sort of verification to prove that it was indeed you that did the Macgyvering. This would create an incredibly difficult burden on our moderators - I wouldn't advocate for something like this if we had ten times the mods we do now. It's ultimately all about bringing Macgyver-y content to TSMG - so really

All awards selection and the selection process will be held behind the curtains. It'd be nice to do some sort of community voting

**May 2013 will be the first month within which the TSMG awards are open. All submissions made during the month of May are eligible.**

Here is a simplified explanation of the process:

At the first of the month

If a nominated post passes the private voting, or completely unable to attain mod support, then that post won't win. If there's no winning nominations for a category, the award simply will not be given out for that month.

**There will be no ties

Nominations

Voting for a month in particular (in this case, and TSMG is definitely not everything in our lives.

At the beginning of the following year

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

###In Conclusion...

&amp;nbsp;

...I want to give big shout-outs to the other moderators for their help with this update. Shout outs as well to /u/FluffRule and /u/gavin19 for their phenomenal help with the CSS

Big props to /r/csshelp in general - if you're going to start your own subreddit

^^^All ^^^link ^^^flair ^^^must ^^^burn

Big thanks of course go out to our submitters who give us all a reason to be here and the subscribers who give us someone to show our crazy tech wizardry to.

Looking forward, comments, criticism, mullet hairstyling tips? Chuck 'em all right here as a reply to this post. I'll read every one of 'em, I promise.

&amp;nbsp;

Tech Support Macgyver has had a rough few weeks lately. One of our mods resigned due to other commitments

This all happened roughly via the TSMG Awards for June 2013. We didn't forget - it just took an exceedingly long time to hear back from them at all. (The TSMG awards are not cancelled - they are merely delayed.)

The short

It is in no way comprehensive and is often silly or outright strange in places. It will take between 5 and 20 minutes to complete depending on how many of the numerous optional questions you answer and to what degree you answer them.

So go ahead and apply. I might take on 2 mods

Oh

Moderator applications will be open for a little over 72 hours - the deadline is Thursday

&amp;nbsp;

We've also started working on integrating Automoderator functionality into TSMG. There's been a hiccup or two so far but for the most part it's been running smoothly.

I'm working on learning how best to use it and it will take time. For now, too - just be sure to include a link to the reported post so we know what the hell you're talking about.

&amp;nbsp;

As for the TSMG Awards

I applied electrical tape to both sides of the case where the screw holes were. After this the noise stopped and the fan seems quieter in general. The tape is also barely noticeable.

We quickly learned that moving around the gym with the ipod causes gaps in the streaming

I was hoping someone in this community might help me work a solution to make the connection more stable. What would be the max distance that a bluetooth connection *should* hold? Is the fact that we're jumping/gymnasticizing around the cause? Would I be able to make some sort of makeshift reflector to add to signal stability? Do we maybe just have a crappy bluetooth receiver?

Thanks in advance for any advice
