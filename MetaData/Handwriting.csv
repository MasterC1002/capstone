TL;DR/""cursive is too hard to read"" version:

- My rant about the value of cursive
- How to learn cursive
  * Correct any glaring postural errors
  * Find an example of the cursive you want to emulate
  * Practice
  * Done

---------------------------------------------------

**EDIT** (30/12/12) - I really wonder how much of the stuff is legible (seems people are just reading the TL;DR version anyway)

---------------------------------------------------

**In defence of handwriting**

Hello, and people who post their handwriting asking for advice. I was like that once - a long time ago - and I wish to offer my two cents.

**The value of cursive**

There are some passionate detractors of cursive writing, due to the amount of control and attention needed to execute a legible cursive, and two, there are many alternatives available (such as email and instant messaging). I agree with both these points. Cursive is ""slow"", but there is such wide variation between people in writing block and cursive it is foolish to compare the two, even in the most general sense. With practice, it is possible to write as fast as block while maintaining legibility. This brings me to the next point. A complaint about cursive is its legibility. This is due to a number of reasons, because they derive pleasure from it, lack of daily exposure

Finally, even the most ardent proponent of technology must admit to the value of handwriting. Imagine receiving a handwritten ""thank you"" note after a dinner party, a letter from a school friend, even a to-do list from a significant other. Is it that hard to imagine the difference in your reaction, receiving a handwritten versus a typed note? Is it not a special feeling, to know a person on the other end has take the time to write to you, to you and you only, where the only effort needed on the author's part is ""insert recipient name here""?

Whether you like it or not, you probably would not be reading this. Let me now talk about how to get that cursive you wanted.

**Learning cursive**

This is to all those on this subreddit who wish to learn cursive, there are no magic bullets or shortcuts. As has been repeated time and time again by others, the only way to do it is through constant practice. It is one thing to post up a writing example and request critique and advice, but that can only go so far. The person looking at it is scrutinising but a small snapshot of your writing, and knows nothing about how busy you are, what amount of writing you usually do, your writing posture, but luckily this is very attainable.

Firstly, or if you hold your pen in a peculiar way. Then, find an example of a cursive you would like to emulate. If you happen to know the author, you may be able to obtain an example of their handwriting alphabet to get a ""clean"" example sheet. If you do not know this person, or if he/she is unfortunately dead (as is the case with many great cursive writers), at least find a large enough writing example to start with. This allows you to look at each letter individually (capitals and lower case), and also how the letters link up in words. 

Then, with the emphasis on computers and technology, most people do not write enough during their school or work day. Set aside yourself some time, even just 15 minutes a day, starting with the alphabet letters individually and then try linking when you are happy with how they look. Oh, and, there is absolutely no need to buy ""good"" pen or paper for this. They do not make things easier or faster. A ballpoint pen on a school notepad is more than adequate.

That is pretty much it. As is with everything worth doing, see it as an opportunity to practice. It is not like painting, sports or browsing websites, which require specific tools and an allocated time. All you need is a pen and some paper.

I've commented on a few ""help me improve"" posts.  I thought I'd collect up some of my thoughts and suggest a slightly different approach

I was 12 or 13 years old when I had a personal lightbulb moment about penmanship and neat printing when I took a drafting class in school.  If I could find a community college with an evening class on just Drafting Lettering

In drafting, but **lettering**.  It's very very specific.  You make every letter the way the template shows it.  If the round part of the letter is almost like a perfect circle, you do the same.  If the stem is this high and is perfectly vertical, you make yours the same height and vertical as well.

It's largely about attention to detail.  This page has a really good analysis and composition of Upright Gothic which, starting at [Fig. 22](http://www.kellscraft.com/EssentialsofLettering/Images/Fig022.jpg).

That tells you the stroke order of the uppercase letters.  The stroke order of the lowercase letters is in a diagram further down the page.  And there are some practice strokes and curves in there as well.  Being Chinese, but I can see and feel the difference in English text as well.  In some of the samples posted here, I can see how it has affected the overall ""neatness"" of look and feel.

When I was taught lettering as a child, neatness just goes without saying.  But a strict lettering style is needed this because you don't want groups of people collaborating on drawings and having 90 different types of letters everywhere.  Make your circles perfectly round if the sample you're following makes them round.  Make your lines join where your sample guide makes them join.  Make the hook and tails look exactly the way the examples do.  Don't put things at an angle when they should be perpendicular.  Attention.  To.  Detail.

Obviously, seeing a glyph written in an entirely different way gave me tremendous insight as to how to change my normal printing to make it ""neater"".  The '8' done as two circles, for example, is much easier to print neatly than an 's' and then a backward 's' on top of it.

You'll probably want to relax these rules after you get the hang of it... or it's perfectly acceptable to continue to be OCD about it.  But learn the rules before you bend/break them all.  =)

[Fig. 29 - Letters with Direction Lines](http://www.kellscraft.com/EssentialsofLettering/Images/Fig029.jpg) is a really succinct diagram showing what makes that overall ""neatness"" feel of someone's penmanship.  There is a very clear and very consistent set of direction lines that you can put on top of the whole block of text and all the letters lean almost exactly on those direction lines.  The straight parts of all the letters lean at nearly the exact same slope.  The tangents and/or axis lines of curved parts all lean at exactly the same slope.  This consistency comes with A LOT

The samples showing ""messy"" printing/writing have curved straight parts of letters and they curve in different ways or lean at different angles.  Sometimes

The way I do lower case letters is pretty standard and conforms to most cursive conventions; however, H, K and Q). It is therefore pretty normal if you do not like the looks of some, so feel free to change them to suit your preferences.

But something's been bothering me

&gt;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

&gt;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

&gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

&gt;What do you think

It's not that I don't like critiquing someone's handwriting

* **It's not a natural sample**. Because one simply posts their alphabet and a single sentence
* **They're boring to read**. Some of us *might* be professional scribes or writers or whatever
* **It's kind of insulting to the idea of handwriting as an art**. If you ask me, we can only rightly judge when looking at a *piece*, not a boring old sample.

I found a few posts which I really liked for their samples (I'm a writer so of course I gravitate towards poetry)

* [Part of ""Ode to a Nightingale"" in my handwriting. Open to tips and criticism.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Handwriting/comments/163b2u/part_of_ode_to_a_nightingale_in_my_handwriting/)
* [Robert Frost
* [Can you critique my script? I would like to make it prettier. This is my natural everyday handwriting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Handwriting/comments/16bt6m/can_you_critique_my_script_i_would_like_to_make/)
* [My functional print handwriting. Tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Handwriting/comments/16awrz/my_functional_print_handwriting_tips/)

For what it's worth, this [awesome signature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carl_Friedrich_Gau%C3%9F_signature.svg) and the [NYT article on the new Treasury secretary's signature](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/a-new-scribble-on-your-dollar-bill/?smid=re-share).

I find a big stumbling block for me when it comes to producing legible writing is having a brain fart in the middle of writing a word

I've recently stumbled on a trick that has helped me quite a bit. I'm curious if anyone else here might have success with it

Pick some text to write down on paper. Take your time and visualize how each word *should* look in your handwriting before you write the word down. Really get that picture in your head. It only took me about 5 minutes to produce writing nearly as fast as my usual efforts and with much greater legibility. I think with further practice this may be promising.

Such has been my method until last night, I grabbed a ruler and made lines in pencil. This worked well (erased them after, of course) but I could see it getting tedious if I wrote a letter longer than two or three pages.

Often, or are held back due to poor penmanship. Long-term, dysgraphics suffer from esteem issues, depression, poor self-image and anxiety. Many develop extensive coping mechanisms to avoid hand writing altogether.

I'm dysgraphic. Can't handwrite for shit, doctors, neurologists and all of the remedial classes, stern warnings, pleading, and more than a few smacks on the knuckles with a yardstick I got in the educational system.

Hiya r/handwriting! 
Sort of a new years resolution of mine to improve my handwriting as I have recently landed a 
job that requires a lot of writing.
A habbit of mine is to use capitals letters
Any critisim much appriciated but I'm mainly after pointers when it comes to technique.
The lower case example shown I find myself  
really needing to concentrate whilst doing

I'm going to put aside 30 minutes every couple of days to try and nail some of the cursive i've seen here.
I signed my name ('Joe Payne') at the bottom also which i am aiming to look more appealing to the eye
would be great!

Used a fountain pen and then a biro below.

Help!

I'm a big fan of penmanship and love browsing around subreddits like this to see some great calligraphy skills and how you guys improve upon it. 

I've recently been looking for someone with immense calligraphy skills to design a new text-based logo for my band Me Versus I. Right now our logo is used with a free computerized font that we got off of Freefonts

Anyone with a scanner or a PC art tablet would be great. The logo we have now itself is pretty simple, but it just doesn't compare to a unique original hand-drawn logo. 

Your art will be going on MY bass drum to be toured around the US with, stickers, CDs, and loads of other merch. You could make one, or two, or even five logos, and the one we choose we'll be forever in their debt. Think of it not only as doing a favor, we know all about improvement and trial/error.

Below is the logo as it stands now. You can use this as a reference and to get an idea of what we're looking for. It's elegant but sharp and rugged. It should be aesthetically pleasing

The first sample is some handwriting that I'd normally like to have, even if not much of an improvement.

A few critiques I can say myself is that my handwriting isn't very uniform. I often rotate my pen a lot when I write, small handwriting to bold, extreme italic handwriting. You don't see it as much here but there are some extreme examples I was too lazy to find. I also need to work on just general letter formation and other things.

This is my current writing style. I'm left-handed

It's the only one I could find.

Anyway, and I was hoping you fine ladies and gentlemen could assist me in this art of handwriting.

It took me about 2.5 minutes to write this. I'm going quite slowly as I'm writing.

[This is my normal speed.]

I think the paper I am using is really the problem. I would like to find something a little more smooth than the one cent notebooks I have now. I used to love writing on the grey receycled newsprint tablets from elementary school with a really bold ballboint pen. It was so smooth! Does anyone have any similar experiences with fountain pens and remember the paper you were using? (I tried the newsprint tablet with a fountain pen and the nib just tore the paper up.)

I'm not very good at writing without lines. Does anyone have any good suggestions on how to transition? I find that my writing on a chalk or marker board looks REALLY childish and sloppy compared to my smaller writing on paper. It looks about the same when I try to write anything on paper without lines. Any suggestions would help!
