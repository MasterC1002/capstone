This is it. After much learning and experimenting my wifi Wikipedia Server / messaging service is setup. It features: 

Legend:

1. 30 watt monocrystalline solar panel 
2. 30 Amp solar charge controller (supports up to 450 watts).
3. Watt's Up DC electricity consumption meter to measure actual watts / peak watts / amps going to the battery.
4. 85 Amp hour deep-cycle battery
5. Another Watt's Up meter to measure actual DC load coming off the battery.
6. 400 watt DC-to-AC inverter 
7. AC Kill A Watt electric usage monitor to measure / compare AC/DC conversion loss and track total hours / watts consumed 
8. Buffalo Wifi router with custom WRT firmware to redirect connected devices to the wifi to server 
9. Small web server running Debian

Stats:

* Total operating electricity consumption: ~10 watts. 
* Total cost in parts: ~$480 (including misc cabling and connectors)
* Given [5 hours of sun](http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/reno-nevada.html) the setup can generate about 150 Wh, consumes about 240 Wh in a given 24 hour period (10 * 24). Starting with a fully charged battery it should last longer than a week straight meeting my requirements. 
* I could investigate adding another 30 or even 100 watt solar panel to be able to last indefinitely as well as charge phones and other devices without worry of running down the server.

I was a total noob when I started this project. Barely knew the different between AC and DC power. I also learned a lot from asking questions on [http://electronics.stackexchange.com](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/19707/powering-a-30-watt-computer-in-the-middle-of-the-desert). Very helpful and thorough guys.

*Safety*

I wanted to start with a short message. When you're blacksmithing there are any number of hazards you are dealing with the entire time. It's important to be aware of what they are and how to deal with them.

&gt;Issues can arise from heating metal to the temperatures required for blacksmithing. It can be hazardous to your health if proper precautions are not taken. Please be aware that I am not condoning that you do this with my information alone. Please do your own research into the subject and I will do my best to provide links to information that fills in gaps that I can not provide.


[Metal Fume Fever](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_fume_fever)

[Toxic Metal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_metal)

[OSHA heavy metal page](http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/metalsheavy/)

[Case Study in Metal Fume Fever. Please read the messages from other blacksmiths for more information on PawPaw and FMF](http://www.anvilfire.com/iForge/tutor.php?lesson=safety3/demo)

1. Eye protection. - This goes TRIPLE, no.. I can't really express how important this is. In a survival situation you NEED your eyesight. Make sure you have some kind of ADEQUATE protection for your eyes. Goggles that are shatter proof and provide full protection around the eyes is ideal. You don't want any hot foreign materials getting into your eyes. Brightness isn't an issue unless you're dealing with an arc welder.

2. Everything is Hot. - When working with hot metal this is always good to keep in mind. If it drops, or tongs. Don't touch anything without protective covering or checking the temperature with a drop of oil or water.

3. Clothing - Full cotton or wool only. No synthetic materials. Leather

4. First aid - Get yourself an aloe plant. They're stupidly convenient for burns. Break off a piece and squeeze some pulp/juice onto the wound. Burns or cuts will be your number one issue if you're not 100% careful. I have many many burns and cuts to prove it. Don't touch. Hot. Sharp. Etc. You can't afford to get frivolous injuries

5. Ventilation - If you're in a room without good ventilation you'll get carbon monoxide poisoning. Headaches. Light headed. Dizziness. Vomiting. Death in severe cases. That's why I suggest a blacksmith lean-to for your semi-outdoor needs. Preferably in a nice windy spot to keep the air moving.

I think I touched on the major stuff. Feel free to add anything you think might be useful in the comments and I'll add it.

*Tool List*

I'll be making two entries for each tool. Prepared and Unprepared.

What do you need?

[Hammers!](http://www.countryliving.com/cm/countryliving/images/CLX0305Guild001-de.jpg)

&gt;Lots to choose from
&gt;
&gt;You want a hammer with a smooth face, depending on your size. I would recommend a good 1.5 for beginners.
&gt;
&gt;Smooth face and rounded edges so it doesn't leave deep hammer marks on your metal. On the reverse side you want a cross-pein.
&gt;
&gt;[This Hofi Hammer](http://images.goemerchant.net/StoreData/b/blacksmith_supply/Images/P10_Hofi_Hammer_1.jpg) shows what the pein looks like (when exaggeratedly fat.) You can find them in all shapes and sized. Round peins, and more.
&gt;
&gt;Prepared:
&gt;
&gt;Hardware stores typically carry some kind of blacksmith's hammer. If not look for a ""cross-pein"". Again. Smooth face
&gt;
&gt;Unprepared: Smooth down the face of any old hammer you've got if you have the time. If not you CAN use a rough-faced hammer. Use the same guidelines as above if-a-scavenging. Check old barns. Auto-shops. Etc.

**ANVILS**

*Oh boy. These are a must-have for any blacksmithing project. The problem is where do you find one? Acme doesn't deliver during a global disaster.

Prepared: Anvils can be mighty expensive. $1.00-2.00 per pound. Or more, and want an anvil for some reason. Look on craigslist. Depending on where you are you can find an old one listed for cheap.

80lbs

There are different types of anvils as well. Farrier anvils have long curved horns

Check it out before you buy it. Bring a ball bearing. Drop it on the anvil from arm height. It'll bounce well if it is a hardened steel surface and ring like a bell if everything is solid. Cracks breed dull sounds. (Wrapping a chain around the base

Unprepared: Train yards, but they're alright. Same for large pieces of track. They make great anvils on a budget. (Grab the spikes too, they're good enough steel for low-impact knives).*

**Wind Power!**

Bellows!

Prepared: You can find these online pretty easily

Unprepared: Four sticks, the other out. Attach the bladder to your sticks so you can inflate/deflate at will. I can't actually offer details on building one as this is the one tool I haven't made.

**Some kind of pliars!**

Again

**Bucket of water or oil/fat/wax**

Iron and steel behave differently when cooled rapidly. The extra carbon in steel makes it snap together much more forcefully. The result is microcracks and destabilization of the metal's structure. Fragile and likely to break. To avoid this with steel, or something similar. Don't do this without reading the advanced heating and tempering section.



*Making The Forge*

Requirements:

Pipe.

Dig a hole in the ground that's a few inches bigger than the project you're working on. It could be long

Grab yourself a metal pipe of some kind (not lead). I used a broken piece of basketball goal. Took me a few minutes to stress-break with brute force. A hacksaw would be useful for this.

If you can plug one end of the pipe put some holes along the top for air escape

Place the pipe in the trench and bury it so that the exhaust end is in the hole and the other is above ground. Attach your bellows to the pipe and you've got yourself a basic pit forge. This can be permanent and works amazingly well

He would place a barrel in the hay loft near the edge of the loft and fill it with old oil. He would then insert a piece of thick hemp rope into the barrel and let the end hang down 12 ft to the floor of the barn. There he had another barrel and the other end of the rope would be placed in that barrel. The rope would soak up the oil and it would slowly run down the rope like a capillary action siphon and drip into the bottom barrel where it would be clean and shiny as new oil. While the oil may have some wear on it (chains being broken) I have read that oil really never wears out. Most of the dirt in oil is nothing but carbon and the rope apparently removes most of this. 

I have no idea if the oil is 'renewed' and safe but it sure looked good and I never once heard the tractor complain. It is a good thing to remember after the fall and you are in need of some clean oil.

You can see where this is going. **Higher up still** is an optical data layer containing petabytes of data that is only able to be unlocked once society follows the instructions through to the point of being able to decode it.

Each layer of the monolith contains a greater and greater level of information. They needn't be expensive to make, storing snapshots of wikipedia which are accessible to any civilisation regardless of how technologically advanced they might be.

They could even be sent into space

It's the only way to really create any likelihood of protecting the human data from a full reset. (plus it's cool :)

You can skip this part if you're in a rush.
***

Hi everybody! We've grown quite steadily over this past year and I just want to say, there have been very few posts that I've needed to remove and you guys haven't caused any sort of drama. Keep up the great work!

Also and I should mention I've never done particularly well in English class

**The Wiki**[](/a22)
***

Now to business. As some of you may know, and it's pretty much impossible to include *everything* that one would need to bring yourself from the stone age back to modern civilization, but we can try. Hence the wiki. But it's down. And last I checked, I couldn't *actually* download anything. So that probably means whatever content was on there is lost. Anyways that means we've got to rebuild it. Now the original wiki appeared to be hosted on somebodies private server, which I don't have access to. So that means we've got three options.

* ~~**Screw the wiki**

*  ~~**Use a SVN**. Somebody suggested using a software revision and control system to create a wiki. Github appears well suited to that. The problem with Github is the wiki tools are a bit annoying to use.~~

* ~~**Use Wikia**. I like this option because the tools are great, we've got more control over content and most importantly, we can download the database file.~~

* **We've made a Wiki [here](http://postcollapse.wikinet.org/wiki/Main_Page)**

Should we go through with the wiki

If you'd like to participate in the rebirth of the wiki please go [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/vpibi/weekly_wiki_wednesday_thread/).

**The Rules** [](/a06)
***
This subreddit has grown steadily since my last announcment and I'd like to re-iterate the rules:

* The most important being **NO COLLAPSE NEWS**. We get it, do so in /r/Collapse. I'm also not going to half assedly make a comment asking if it's okay to remove offending posts, then do nothing for a week. What I will be doing is making a comment asking what merit this post has, give the OP or anyone else 24 hours to respond and then promptly remove it.

* ~~**No linking to specific products or gear**. Now I'm kind of on the fence with this one. On one hand, gear, or anything that requires money must be a self post.** When making a post please give a small review or reasons as to why we should buy it.

* **No Circlejerking**. Okay this isn't an official rule and not really one I need to bring up but probably should. Now this is extremely subjective so just keep two things in mind. The first being **no Zombie talk**. I'm not really going to enforce this
The second I'd like you to keep in mind is **The Collapse may come in any shape or size**.  The Collapse could be as small as a food or job shortage or a large as a nuclear winter. The future might look like Cuba after peak oil or something as terrible as The Road. So when somebody asks about a particular scenario

If you have any problems with these rules

Having studied camouflage and done a lot of my own testing

**Military Camouflage Patterns**

First of all, the more uniforms you need to manufacture, which can become cripplingly expensive when you have a large military force.

*[Solid Color Fatigues](http://www.armyuniverse.com/images/product_images/medium/5935.jpg)* - The most available option is to simply go with fatigues that most closely match your environment. Subdued green in forests, or grey in urban areas. While this does tend to help you blend in, it does nothing to break up your outline. The problem is that the human brain is a pattern recognition engine, and an extremely good one at that, and the human form is one of the things we recognize very easily. Solid color fatigues are generally only good at making you harder to spot at long distances where the human eye would merely regard you as a differently-colored speck against a background.

*[M81 Woodland](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/BDUs-forest.jpg), which involves patterns of irregular ""blobs"" of shapes designed to break up the human outline. This camo works fairly well, but has a tendency to ""blob"" up at a distance while also contrasting at extremely close ranges, making it somewhat less effective if you are not at the correct distance. These types of camouflage are still more effective than wearing normal clothes or solid-color fatigues, however.

*[Multicam](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/MultiCam-trans.jpg)* - One of the ""exceptions to the rule"", as well as using smaller overall ""blobs"" of color. The resulting pattern blends more readily into a wider array of environments (from deserts to forests) and still excels at breaking up the human outline. Despite the older pattern technology, Multicam is capable of out-performing most modern digital camouflage patterns in a wider array of environments.

**Digital Camouflage**

Digital Camo is the latest trend in the armed forces (though it's more accurate technically to call it ""pixelated"", the overall pattern tends to more smoothly blend from one region to the next, resulting in an effect that is more difficult for the human eye to discern. The result is a pattern that works like the aforementioned M81 Woodland and other patterns, but at a wider range of distances and without the contrasting or blobbing effects. There are different ""standard"" digital patterns available:

*MARPAT* - This is the common pattern used by the US Marine Corps, but again, because they are ""broad spectrum"" patterns, they are not specialized for any one environment in particular.

*CADPAT* - This Canadian pattern is what MARPAT was based off of. Like MARPAT,_Royal_Canadian_Regiment.jpg) and [Arid Region (AR)](http://www.hyperstealth.com/miltex/Aritex-45-Desert-1.jpg). The digital patterns are virtually identical to MARPAT, though coloration differs slightly, with the CADPAT woodland camo having more green than MARPAT's version.

*[UCP - Universal Camouflage Pattern](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Army_Combat_Uniform.jpg)* - This one is currently in use by the US Army, and grey. While it was toted as a ""universal"" pattern that worked reasonably well in all environments, the truth is that it works only in a very narrow band of environments and demonstrates that there is no such thing as a ""one for all"" camouflage pattern. I have noticed that this pattern does work fairly well in scrub desert environments, especially among sagebrush where the sage green coloration blends in remarkably well (as the name would suggest).

**Civilian Market Patterns**

There are numerous patterns available on the civilian market

*A-TACS* - Like MARPAT, more organic pixel pattern rather than the squre patterns used by older digital camouflage, giving the pattern a more natural feel and allowing it to blend into most environments more readily. Obviously, A-TACS is still a more ""broad spectrum"" pattern, but it is (in my experience) marginally more effective than those in use by the military today.

*Commerical Hunting Camo* - This camouflage is arguably the best you can get. It is usually printed with actual pictures or images of the environment it's designed to work in, leaves, and other shrubbery. It not only breaks up your outline but actually makes you appear to be part of the environment you're in. The biggest drawback to this type of camo (and the reason it's not used by the military) is that it only works in the very specific environment (and often the *season*) it was designed for. Merely moving ten miles in one direction or wearing it during the wrong time of year can be enough to render your camo much less effective. Depending on your environment, there can be as many as four different types of camo to match the four seasons throughout the year. However, as an individual, you're not trying to supply an entire army, so if you can find suitable sets of this camo for your location

And that's by breakdown. Hopefully, please feel free.

 [About a month or so ago

There will be a TL;DR at the bottom.

###Rule Changes

* **Links to survival gear or products may now be regular posts.** We're small enough that it wouldn't be worth a spammers time to 

* **General Collapse talk is allowed**. Seeing as how it's kinda hard to talk about Post Collapse without taking about Pre or Proceeding collapse

* **Zombie stuff is kinda allowed**. Obviously it has to have applicable information and it'll be up to you as the community to vote as you please. I reserve the right as Mod to super downvote or remove anything I don't like. 

* **Be tolerant of other people's views or attitudes.** This is kinda subjective but in general, lets try and keep this place a warm and welcoming community.

* **Reposting or crossposting from other subreddits is allowed**. We could do with a lot more content from /r/Homesteading for example. 

I'll update the sidebar to reflect this when I'm not feeling so lazy. 

##TL;DR 
We're now becoming /r/Collapse^2 but without the news and doomsday warning crap. Sorta.

And as an afternote

 Also skill building posts too. Like skills and knowledge that'll be useful in any sort of Post Collapse scenario.

I decided the best way would be to have a small length of string to carry with me everywhere.

What I'm doing is picking a knot. I'm sticking to that one knot for several days doing it mirrored, whatever way seems like it could be a way I'd need it in the real world. After a few days of tying it I'll move on to another one. Every couple of weeks I'll go back over each knot without looking at a guide to make sure I've got it well drilled in.

Background: Eagle Scout

* If you are physically capable of doing so, you have to consider the following.  There are people out there with more weapons and explosives than you really want to know, who know how to use them and will if they need supplies...  This is a warning to everyone who is stockpiling supplies and hoping to ""wait it out"".  While having a large cache can be beneficial, you are otherwise painting a big red target on yourself to be ransacked and possibly killed.  It really doesn't matter how much of a defense you think you have.  

* If you insist on remaining stationary or simply have to be due to physical limitations, etc)!  Once again, you are only making yourself a target!  Word of mouth spreads quickly and in the event of a collapse, those who are not prepared will seek out those who they know are well supplied.  Try your best to remain as anonymous as possible. 

* Find gear to live with, practicality and combined usefulness.  You want gear that will outlive you, serve several purposes and be lightweight if possible. If your home base is overrun, you need to be able to survive independently with limited gear until you can reestablish a place to call home.  I will post my gear sometime so you can see what I am talking about.

* Use your gear regularly!  Don't be like [this guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehFYAkC7CJs).  It is important to master all of your gear so you can use it effectively.  I think too many people focus on how to shoot firearms and fail to focus on just about everything else.  How many of you have a survival knife, especially if you have little to no survival experience, but it is very necessary.

* Think about ""currency of the future"".  I read the post about a stack of playboys as being trade worthy, I think knowledge will be most valuable for trade; primarily medical information, maps, and educational material.  In the event of a major collapse, many people will seek these things, but will have little to no access to this information, thus making it potential trade material for yourself.  I have been collecting and sorting through documents like these for several years now

* Have fun with it!  Take your gear and go camping

The first thing is water, use iodine tablets, or simply boil it. 

The second thing is food, foraging, scavenging, and farming. 

hunting is made out to be much more complex than it actually is. the base principal of hunting is remaining undetected. the easiest approach to hunting your own food is finding your preys water supply. look for tracks leading to any source of water, scoop out the guts, off the head, pull off the skin, cook the rest. (NOTE: this is not the only way to hunt but the easiest, i will approach this more if there is a chapter two)

Fishing again is made out to be more complicated than it really is. all you need is a hook, leaf piles for a worm. grab the biggest one you see (dont worry, they cant bite) all you need is one. go find a source of moving water that isn't too fast. throw it in, pull it out repeat process untill you catch a fish. once you've got the fish keep it and go for another. if the fish took your worm scoop it's eyes out and use them as bait one at a time. fish eyes make great bait. 

foraging is a quick source of food given the right environment but should not be relied upon as your primary source of food. look up pine trees for bird nests that you can scarf eggs from. large open fields with gravel often have strawberry patches

Scavenging is one of the few things you can do post collapse that doesn't just apply to living in the wild but works in the city as well. 
City scavenging  consists of but is ot limited to running through dumpsters, and vending machines. 

dumpsters and garbage cans speak for themselves. i know it sounds gross but rotten food is still food. you could pull it off once or twice a week without getting sick. try not to jump in the dumpster if you can tip it over. don't cut yourself on glass. 

abandon convenient stores will likely to have been raided but it never hurts to have a look

Vending machines will probably be the first things to be raided but if you've ever been to a highway rest area you'll would know that they usually have between 4 and 10 vending machines. grab a crowbar and get to work.

Farming is the long term way of producing food. lets assume you dont have any seeds. you will need to find a food plant such as corn, strawberries, ect. dig the entire plant out of the ground, be patient and dont break the roots buy pulling it out by the stem. throw in bag of dirt and take it to your concealed growing field to a hole you've already have dug and prepared. plant as many as you want. water everyday. it's not that hard. (Will post more on farming with seeds, and concealing your growing plot from raiders if there is a chapter two)

The third thing is shelter. ok lets be up front about this

the best solution is to remain hidden. if you are in the wild you will want to find a thick grove of tall trees. (the safest place in the forest is the trees) you dont need any complicated tent and nobody will find you. you will need three 5Ft by 8Ft tarps and four ratchet straps (you know the things they tow cars with). try to stay at canopy level or at least no lower than 40 feet off the ground useing to tarps as a bottom/floor to your shelter and one for the roof.

if your afraid of heights or cant find any trees

if your in the city the safest place would be in the sewers. make sure your know them well. don't start fires there can be methane buildups. use flashlights and glow sticks. if you have a gas mask this would'nt be that bad of a place to live.

What is the biggest threat to your own survival you will face

For myself, but almost everyone heats their homes with oil - which is stored in a small facility on the edge of town, and transported by 1-2 trucks. Their stockpile, unreplenished, couldn't supply 1/2 of the current demand for the entire winter. On top of that, most oil furnaces require electrical power - without that, and as oil runs out - people are going to start to freeze. People with wood furnaces/fireplaces are going to find their homes very appealing real estate. Wood and oil supplies are going to be hot commodities. Food is going to run out

We also have a large elderly population who are going to be dying off fast given the conditions and the cessation of medical care. Many of these frail individuals will be easy pickings for violence and burglaries. 

My biggest threat will be securing a place for sustainable warmth for the winter. Food is also an issue. Firearms and ammunition, but we could quickly become targets for such. I have a bug out location, but it is not perfect.

You are by yourself.  You can only scavenge using tools you have in your bug out bag right now and the jack and tire iron which are in the trunk of the vehicle.  

Here are the game rules:
1.) You can take only what you can carry.  
2.) You only get one trip - much like a carcass on the African Savannah you know there are other scavengers around
3.) You have to explain how you will use the item you scavenge

There will be starvation, but it will not last for decades and the infrastructure will not just up and disappear forever. We're not going to have to fall back to a pure barter system where the entire country is living in the middle ages again.

Realistically, and chaos in large population centers, followed probably by some form of martial law to bring things back under control. However, the worst of it won't last beyond a few years, and within five years you can expect supermarkets, utilities, and nation-wide shipping to be back up and running.

Those of you considering converting all of your money into supplies because ""money will be worthless post-collapse"", just like every other economic collapse in every other country. Bartering might become a temporary, localized method for exchange, but it's not going to have time to become standardized.

Not entirely sure if this post meets with the rules but I'll try to stick as best as possible to the topic. Since I believe we are entering (albeit slowly) a collapse scenario in Egypt. I'll be providing some reading material as proof if needed. And I could use some help in properly preparing for it. Hopefully maybe I'm overreacting.

It's been two years since we've had our so called ""revolution"". I live in Cairo and in comparison to the other parts of Egypt

Politics aside, fuel shortages](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/world/middleeast/egypt-short-of-money-sees-crisis-on-food-and-gas.html?_r=0). In relation to gas stations, I've seen long lines of cars surrounding gas stations angrily demanding demanding fuel. 

That same fuel is also not being properly supplied to power stations and the end result is that we have been having power outages that last from 45 minutes to an hour and half. This is only because I live in Cairo. I can imagine that those living in the outskirts or in the poorer regions they last longer. These power outages are intentionally made so that it wouldn't overload the system. With the summers coming

Humorously enough, a couple of incidents have occurred in one of the smaller cities of Egypt where [**NSFL**two thieves were hanged and beaten to death by a mob **NSFL**](http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_982w/2010-2019/Wires/Online/2013-03-17/AP/Images/Mideast%20Egypt.JPEG-05be8.jpg). So with that mob rule and vigilantism seems to be the way its done. Surprisingly enough, just last week in front of my home a mugger appeared and tried to snatch a purse from a woman but got caught by another mob who beat him but let him go.

Aside from all this, transferring it abroad or changing it another currency as the Egyptian pound is tanking. I barely managed to change my savings into US$ so that I would not lose what little I have. 

So with all of these protests, unless the Egyptians put their differences aside and get their shit together (which doesn't seem likely at the moment given how things are going), the society is decaying. Essentially things could escalate to be civil unrest, or hopefully not, a civil war. A quick google search landed me on this [link discussing levels of escalation towards civil unrest](http://www.getreadygear.com/surviving-riots.aspx). Whether this may be factual info or not, I could use it as a reference as to how things are currently going over here. I'd say that at the moment, Egypt is somewhere between level 2 and 3. Essentially most of the country is still in level but taking in some level 3 elements such as controlling the banks and money as well as police checkpoints. 

After all this background onto my story, all we have are cheap stick to the wall emergency light that serve a very limited purpose. The security in the apartment we live in is very lax and the only ""deterrent"" we have is a porter who only watches for people who come and go. The other tenants aren't willing to invest in better security such as iron gates. 

For personal/family security, gun licenses were next to impossible to acquire and you needed the right connections to get on. In terms of ""security"" all I have is an air rifle and a few knives. Laughable. Instead I'm looking for any suggestions on home defense that prevents someone from getting in. 

So to finalize this long read, Security, first aid and possibly fuel. Tips, resources, possibly gadgets. Something that would last us a good while. I mean, how long should one prepare for such a case? All i see are 72 hour/ week long disaster kits. Thank you all for bearing with me. 

**TL;DR:** Worried that my country is slowly going into a collapse that would end into civil unrest/war. Need methods, security, first aid and power (possibly fuel) for long term. I already have resources where I can live up to a month but I need more than that.",,False,self,t5_2sfb4,,http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/1bcrw0/preparing_for_civil_unrest_in_egypt_or_worse/

I'm not sure how you can separate discussion of what comes after the collapse without discussing the features of a collapse.

How the collapse is likely to play out is *absolutely germane* to any discussion of what to do after the collapse.

Even suggesting that there's a solid distinction between the collapse and post collapse undermines the discussion for those who see the collapse as a *process*

Also

I suggest the rules ought to read somewhere along the following lines:

* No Collapse news or warnings **without contextualizing the discussion to adapting and dealing with the world** ***post collapse***. ~~Take that stuff to /r/Collapse~~ For specific discussion and news isolated to the collapse

* No general collapse talk (stories

1312230685.0,j60at,Complete guide to survival in post collapse society Chapter ll,15inchpeenus,64,17,31,"In this chapter i will be going over a multitude of things ranging from advanced hunting

Let's get started. 
Advanced Hunting consists more of trailing and stalking your prey than simply waiting for it to walk by on it's way to the local watering hole http://i.imgur.com/bsZbJ.jpg. 

Many people will dwell on having a rifle or shotgun for hunting in the post collapse era. that's all fine for the first year or so but once the prey become aware of your presence they will migrate away from the normal lands they are found in. it is best for long term survival to make each kill as stealthy and undetected as possible. one of the best ways to achieve this is to use a crossbow or better yet a compound bow for large game such as deer. coupled with fullbody camouflage that can be found at most any walmart or sporting goods store. (now is the time to start stocking up on supplies guys)

Like most nocturnal herbivores deer see mostly through movement. the trick to sneaking up on them is remaining quiet, then repeat. keep circling the the watering hole that animals frequently visit. animals are most active 2 hours before and up till sunrise, and 4 hours after the sun sets. 

For small game i recommend a nice silent high powered pellet rifle. failing that a 22. is acceptable. small game are not often seen far from there primary food source. a patch of acorn trees serves as a good place to stake out an await that rabbit or squirrel. don't limit yourself to acorn trees though

You also might try luring your prey into you, and the occasional 
coyote. for crows and buzzards all you will need is a knife and a dead fish about 5-12 inches long. Go to a field

For larger scavengers like coyotes and coy dogs you can leave a dead animal carcas in the middle of a field. between midnight and 4 am would be the best time to sit and watch the carcas. (this is when coyotes are usually most active)


Farming your own crops from scratch is much more easier to accomplish than most people think it is. the first thing you will need to do is decide wether your crop will be in the ground or in buckets, cover with dirt, and water upon planting to get them started quicker. keep all your plants about 8-10 inches apart to allow them room to grow. That's about all there is to farming. remember! this is post society, crops will be scarce NEVER tell anybody that you have food growing. 


Concealment is one of the most valuable skills to have in post society. one of the best things you can stock up on is camouflage burlap. it's sold at walmart

Hiding crops will be a bit more difficult

If your crops are in buckets to can paint them green and black or just wrap camo burlap around them and hang them in the tops of trees.

If you have any questions please ask



(I will go over more subjects including: waterproof concealment techniques, bartering/placing value on item in post society, and much more if there is enough interest for a Chapter lll)

So this is something that I picked up in scouts. Each of us was given one when we went on our first long-term backpacking trip. It is a 25 cc glass flask that contains a few iodine crystals. (a few grams maybe? not sure exactly how much) You fill the flask with water and wait about 45 minutes, I have never noticed an appreciable decline in the number or size of iodine crystals. I haven't done the math to see how much water it could purify, but i suspect somewhere in the thousands of gallons. So compared to pills i think this is a great option for a PC situation.

Food is a major problem in a survival situation. I'm going to mention some of the things that most people do not consider edible, anything I mention here is *something I have eaten.*

**Reptiles**

- Most lizards are very, gut the lizard. The innards fall out almost as cleanly as those of a fish. Leave the skin on - it will char and curl away from the meat. Cook spitted on a stick, over open flame, for at least half an hour. As there are very few diseases easily transmittable from lizard to human, no worries about food-borne disease - you're cooking it to make it tasty, not for disease. Undercooked lizard tastes horrible. Eat spitted, and discard the skin as you go.
- Snakes require some knowledge. First, cut 4"" below the head. Snake mouths contain horrible bacteria. Venomous snakes keep their poison sacs near the head. Be careful handling the head - even after decapitated, the head can still bite - bury it. Hang the beheaded snake from a tree branch and let it bleed. Cut the entire stomach open - the innards will be obvious, and can be craped out. Once you've made the belly incision, the skin peels back with only a little work (peel from the head side upward). DO NOT BOIL THE SNAKE WHOLE. Snake bone marrow stinks like hell if boiled. If making stew, cut the flesh off with a knife first. Otherwise, just roast over open fire. Tastes a LOT like chicken, and a large garter snake.

**Mammals**

- I have eaten rat. It wasn't bad. Same with guinea pig.
- Squirrel varies
- Cat tastes horrible. Avoid it. This means both domestic and wild. Bitter
- Dog isn't much better. Very gamey. Only in a life or death situation.
- Turtle is pretty damned good. Tastes fishy
- Easy ones that taste good: Rabbit, alligator, wild boar, nutria, antelope, ostrich.
- Pigeons and doves are fucking tasty.
- Bat is delicious
- Bear and lion have led me to believe that any major carnivore is gross. I'd eat it if it meant life. Blugh. Bear Bacon is absolutely gamey
- Donkey, thereby, that horse meat is also quite palatable.

**Other:**

- Earthworms aren't bad if you fry them in butter and crack an egg on it. Same for mealworms and locusts. They are crunchy
- Forests contain a plethora of foodstuffs, even acorns can be prepared nicely. Be careful, exceedingly, with fungus. Also, the lining of tree bark is genuine fortified with vitamins.
- Research which ants are good to eat. Seriously. Most are alright, will mess you up.
- Wild beehives can be taken
- Always, because raw food can kill you - worse, it can make you suffer horribly before you die.

**Survival in a environment relies upon the simple concept of adaptation, know how to survive in a certain scenario, etc.** A proper PostCollapse guide should focus simply on the idea of being adaptable, and less on specifics - why? Because it's so much more efficient. Sure, you can add appendices that will clarify on how to apply the basic concept of adaptation to SPECIFIC events - but it's purely imaginative and inefficient to guess what the collapse will be, because you have no damn clue what it will be. You're a million times better off preparing yourself through the ability to adapt, rather knowing which guns to have, selling the idea of ""grungy camping"" and not the idea of efficiency and adaptation for survival. This especially ties in the joy and idea of being a leader to a survival of mankind. **Throw that shit out the window

I honestly think the wiki in its current state is a waste. It need to be redone in a more easily editable and read-able form (aka mediawiki) and focus on the idea of adapting, hot water, and other great ammenties - but it should focus on the idea of knowing the VERY BASICS - and adapting in an environment to ensure you are healthy. That's what the survival books are written as, and it's what makes them timeless and universal. I'm NOT dissing the idea of adding in such special skills - but in the weight of priority so many things (so far unspoken for) are far greater in importance.

FYI [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/kru75/dammit_zombies_arent_real/) is a perfect example of what this subreddit is becoming - a game. It's like those UFO clubs - people come in acting serious and then just end up screwing around and treating it as a game

104x4=416 cans that can be safely stored

So (shelf life in years) x (consumption per year) = how many of X you can safely store and rotate consumption so that no single X ever goes past its expiry date

The way you may be infected is usually an open wound on your hands allowing the bacteria to enter you while skinning/cleaning the animal the other way would be touching your eyes or mouth prior to cleaning your hands.

On to the skinning:

Simply tear the skin close to the genitals and pull off the hind section of the skin down to the ankles. Then pull the top portion of the skin up and over the head while holding either at the hips or hind legs. Once you get it up with the neck exposed twist the head around a couple of times until you can pull it off. Then you can pull the leg skin down and break off the legs. Now that the animal is skinned you can tear the abdominal skin allowing you to remove the entrails.

I have decided upon a rifle I am buying myself for Christmas... well because *I want it* basically

Anyway the model of the rifle isn't really important

So for this reason my decision is mostly between .223 and 5.45x39.  .223 is obviously very common.  5.45x39 is dirt cheap

.223 is produced locally even though it's more expensive.  My only source for 5.45 is Russian so I would have to stock up a lot of it.  

7.62x39 is sort of in between.  It's popular enough in the USA that there are domestic companies making it.. but the prices I'm finding are on par with .223/5.56 so it's not a very attractive option for me.

A central part of my collapse preparation has been food preservation.  Personally

While I plan on doing both, one is able to can anything, including meat.

However, it is strongly recommended that you use the cheap little metal lids with rubber seals only once.  Unfortunately, I could see that possibly being an issue post collapse.

Does anyone have any idea how to overcome this obstacle?  Jars and the metal bands that hold the lids are reusable for basically ever.  It's just the lids that are the problem.

The lids and bands that I'm talking about [look like this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dw-fFshIzoU/TvTWNyr6TaI/AAAAAAAAAgU/RCCsEnb-0VQ/s1600/canninglids2.jpg).  A company called Tattler does make [reusable Tattler lids](http://www.reusablecanninglids.com/store/index.php/shop/200-pcs-bulk-mix-reg-and-wide-mouth-100-each.html), but they too use a rubber band that I believe needs replaced.  In addition to that, while I can find zinc lids all over the place at flea markets and such, I can never find the rubber seals that are necessary for the lids to work.

Basically, including the seal, and I have just heard wrong?

I know I can stock up, I need something that is reusable.

These strategies envision a declining society

The challenges I deal with here are rolling black outs, fuel shortages, extreme weather, crime/violence, diminished access to health care, diminished access to education, and mental illness.

There are at least 2 challenges I am at a loss for providing input on that are and will continue at increasing rates to plague our society: unemployment and inequality.  I have some ideas

My personal philosophy is less “survivalist” than “transition/thrivalist”.  I believe we need to take an active interest in meeting the challenges our society faces as opposed to running from the problem into the hills with ramen noodle stockpiles and guns. 

I’ve tried to leave some resources to get people on the right foot

I wish you all the best

**Rolling Black Outs**

* Regularly back-up data.

* Invest in [off-grid]( http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-science/living-off-the-grid.htm) renewable energy such as [solar/thermal/electric](http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/z04kx/strategies_for_a_postpeak_oilclimate_change_world/c60edjv) (*credit: deepgreen*) or wind to *supplement* your home (no need to go extreme and live fully off-grid).  

* Have solar power back-ups for electronic devices.

* Take-up [bee-keeping](http://basicbeekeeping.blogspot.ca/) for a source of wax for candles/light sources (and carbohydrates).

* Learn and make use of skills and technology for [keeping food cold without electricity](http://agreenliving.net/cooling-food-without-electricity/).

* Stock-pile batteries and have a generator handy.

* If possible

**Food Shortages**

* Learn gardening

* Learn [food preservation](http://www.univet.hu/sc1/feltoltott/425_1272276559.pdf) techniques such as canning and food dehydration.

* Support local farms and food producers by shopping at farmers’ markets.

* Learn [composting methods](http://web.extension.illinois.edu/homecompost/methods.html).

* Stockpile long term food stores and rotate your supply.

* Learn

* Learn (from an expert) about and practice urban foraging.

* Invest in organic heirloom seeds stocks and learn to collect the seeds from your crops.


**Water Shortages**

* Stockpile bleach for water purification (among other uses).  (Remember that bleach turns to salt water after a year or so

What do you think is the best way to get fit enough to execute you post collapse plan

Personally, water is often everywhere.  Furthermore, swimming is probably one of the most taxing activities you can do for exercise; you use virtually every muscle and you tax your cardio system.  Swimming is probably the most simple form of a well-rounded exercise form that works all of the muscles of the body.

Then we move onto the bike.  Bicycling or horses may very well become the fastest means of getting from point A to B in a post collapse scenario.  EMP's could disable many cars, there may become solutions, but initially, bicycles might be the most available forms of mechanical transportation and it's going to be important to be able to travel long distances on one.

Finally, with maybe 10 extra calories burnt while running to compensate for faster heart rate, the bodies need to cool itself faster), but running also requires more water as our cooling systems basically use the sweating method.  But knowing you can run pretty far gives you the peace of mind that you can walk a lot further and get a little faster when needs be.

So

Some questions that have come to mind : 

Is it a pain storing wood on board (seems like your old propane locker would be ideal)

Does driftwood ruin the stove (with salt)? 

Does the stove heat and cool too slowly to be useful except in extremely cold environments? 

Do sparks ruin your sails? 

Does water infiltrate the boat

Is it a fire hazard? 

So many questions...

Also, either by modifying an old Dickenson Diesel stove, or by building my own. It'd almost certainly have to be a vertical feed (due to heeling while underway). It's tempting to run the exhaust along the length of the boat with some thermal mass, which also makes use of an existing diesel heater exhaust port, but not if it's going to be a fire issue, or corrode. Also, is stainless the proper material for a marine rocket stove? Perhaps cast iron

One of the biggest challenges with this is thinking about fortifying our home and some other work structures here on the property. The house in particular has a lot of very large windows and glass doors. It is all one-story

There are a couple of tactical advantages to the land at least, looking out onto all the land around us and the two roads below. So at least during the day, we'd see people coming from at least a couple of miles away in any direction and have the upper-hand in defending ourselves. 

My worry with the house is that in order to fully secure it, given my parents are the owners. What are some things we could prepare now that we could put into place later on when needed? I'm thinking along the lines of covering windows and doors, maybe reinforcing one room on all walls.. we  both have big families (I mean including multiple generations) and some friends who may join us if they were willing and able when SHTF. So ideally we could secure at least a big enough area to support 30-40 people.

I am a pretty realistic guy so while worst case scenario could be along the lines of The Road or whatever I am thinking more like the 1930. Whatever the case, a gallon of water, a mutlitool and a shovel being more useful than well.. whatever some people have the fantasy of being useful instead, no offense.

 So with that being said here is my list

A mutlitool
A long lasting flashlight and a bigger one
Lots of batteries (but a realistic amount with my budget)
A good knife
Different kind of rationed food
Sugar
Fuel (don't know how much is enough)

Also I would love to have a gun but I am afraid I live in a socialist country, it is a bit of a bitch. So a gun is out of question, as I somehow get the feeling that should something happen it will happen before 2 years. 
Besides I feel I can use that time on something more important.

I do MMA frequently

What are the best principles for re-organizing society? How do you get people with different worldviews to cooperate in conditions of scarcity -- without resorting to violence?

Basically -- how do we make anarchism work?

Edit: I think the use of the term ""anarchism"" was unclear. This is not advocating for anarchism. What ""anarchism"" refers to is this: collapse usually means circumstances of sustained scarcity. In circumstances of sustained scarcity, become more frequent; the longer the scarcity lasts for, the more this is true. So in a hypothetical collapse scenario, while politicians will still be ""in office,"" they'll be dealing with an increasingly desperate and unruly population. Odds are a group of people will eventually come along and say ""That guy? I didn't vote for that guy. Neither did my friends. He's the one who got us into this mess. But we've got a better plan -- and, also, guns."" Maybe this isn't as much of a problem in the rest of the industrialized world. But it's pretty likely here in the States, and while it'd be nice to think people would always choose cooperation over violence,False,

For me

Background: I was in 8th grade when Hurricane Hugo hit the island of St. Croix in the US Virgin Islands (September 1989). Those of you who were alive and aware at that time likely remember reports of the destruction in Charleston

The Washington Post has a very detailed write-up about the situation in St. Croix in October 1989 that is worth a read if you want to hear what really happens when a society and infrastructure is almost wiped out: [Link](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/hurricane/archives/hugo89a.htm)

I remained on the island for about a month after the storm, and utilities were restored to the island and, even to this day, people still talk about it.

If anyone has questions about my experience -- the storm, that kind of thing -- I'm happy to answer as best as my memory over the years will allow me. I'm not intending to do this in real-time, but I will check in frequently and answer questions as I am able.

You will have a difficult time adjusting at first

**When society has actually collapsed

**Video games:**

Video games will not exist. Instead you will play Role Playing Games like Dungeons and Dragons after all, it's not going to be lost. Try it out some time, get a group of people together. If you have no friends, look on-line if people in your city need anyone to play with them, and join them and make nerd-friends.

Board games of complex and less complex varieties exist that function perfectly as replacement for many turn based strategy games.

**Books**

Books are around and will stay around. But here's the interesting thing:

When popular writers are no longer widely available

**Music**

But how will we do without Lady Gaga? You will adjust. Music can be made perfectly without electric instruments. You don't need computers

I'd like you to meet: 

**NeoFolk music:**

Forseti - Der graue König:

Are the above three too bleak? Try the following:

Dornenreich - Freitanz:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKZthOsdHNE

The entire song consists of three instruments

Think about this for a moment:

When recorded music comes to an end and your favorite band can't travel the continent anymore

Now here's a bit of context. Four month ago a guy named [Selco](http://www.reddit.com/user/selco) made an [IAmA post](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vitie/iama_balkan_war_survivor_lived_in_a_city/) about living in the [Balkans](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Balkan_topo_en.jpg) during [a war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_wars). There was more or less a complete breakdown of society and order with looting and other very unpleasant things happening. In short

A little while later he deletes the post. I assume it's to drive traffic to his website. On his site, articles, interviews and insight into what happens when the shit hits the fan. You'll also receive his Survival Guide ([Scribd](http://www.scribd.com/doc/110974061),[MF](http://www.mediafire.com/view/?w634f4wbxuaybbi),[DB](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3239462/For%20when%20mediafires%20a%20bitch/Selco%27s%20Survival.pdf])) which appears to contain the same information as in the AMA but in a nicer, easier to read format. You'll also receive his newsletters on delightful topics such as Visitng abandoned house, Interview about weapons during SHTF

Now there is a payed version of these courses


[](/rb26 ""Haters gonna hate."") Sadly there is a [bit of debate](http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/vj8as/ama_by_guy_who_actually_lived_it/c54zrgs) over whether or not this guy is telling the truth. Really it just seems to be that one guy

&gt;from http://www.reddit.com/tb/vj36r

&gt;OK

&gt;I am from Balkan region, for 1 whole year i lived and survived in a city of 50 000- 60 000 residents WITHOUT: electricity, fuel,running water,real food distribution, or distribution of any goods, or any kind of organized law or government.

&gt;The city was surrounded for 1 year and in that city actually it was SHTF (shit hit the fan) situation.

&gt;We did not have organized army or police force, fight for his own house and his own family.

&gt;Some of us was better prepared, few owned AK-47 when all started.

&gt;Anyway,hospital looked like butchery, police force vanished, 80 percent of hospital staff gone home.

&gt;I was lucky, 3 Kalashnikov s) so we lived and survived, most of us.

&gt;I remember US Air force dropped MRE every 10 days (god bless USA for that) as help for surrounded city

&gt;After three months rumors started about first deaths from starvation, window frame from abandoned houses for heating, i burned all my own furniture for heating, lot of people died from diseases, mostly from bad water (two of my family members), we used rain water for drink, several times i ate pigeons

&gt;Money was not worth shit. We traded things, most of that women were just desperate mothers, candles, lighters,antibiotics,fuel,batteries, we fight like animals for that.

&gt;In situation like that lot of things change

&gt;Strength was in the numbers, no matter how well armed.

&gt;Anyway

&gt;It was almost 20 years ago when I was a young man, i remember everything, and i think i learned a lot.

&gt;Me and my family are prepared now

&gt;My English is not that good and I will not say what city it was because i still live there (and there is still a lot of bad blood around) but you can ask me anything and i will answer as good as i can.

&gt;More background on my blog too (but please ask question here): http://shtfschool.com

**Short Description:**

The world has changed after an economic collapse. A wave of riots

A college student is found dead on Route 16, he realizes that he has stumbled onto just one piece of a much larger plan.

**Actual Description:**

This novella was written out of a personal interest to imagine a realistic future economic collapse and political unrest. I modeled this scenario after several economic and societal collapses in modern history. To model urban decay, and Johannesburg. To model government responses to economic crises, I used Argentina, the currently developing Eurozone crisis, and the United States in WWII and the OPEC embargo. The response of individuals and societies to economic change was harder to create. I assembled stories from Hurricane Katrina, from the Bosnian War, the Iraq War

This novella borrows heavily from the literary style of Michael Crichton. The limited third-person narrative, and the TV show The Wire, for its penetrating look into the logic of institutional dysfunction.

Any realistic scenario of economic or social upheaval must involve political action. Although the plot involves politics

While there has been a recent boom in post-apocalyptic, and zombie fiction, I believe this novella occupies a unique niche in this space. I hope you will find it worthy of your time and attention.

**Here's why I'm posting it on Reddit:**

1. There's no gimmicks

2. I think it's a pretty entertaining read. I'm not just saying that because I wrote it.

3. I'm not a professional writer. I think it's pretty good

4. I'd like to get some expert opinions. I've done a lot of research, feel free to tell me I've got things totally wrong. If you're a cop, let me know if I've got things wrong.

5. Need fresh eyes. When you write your own story, the plot holes.

6. Editing. There's always going to be some stuff that missed the proofread. I'm not too worried about that right now

7. Gauge interest. This is a 70-page, a 300-page 75000-word novel. But I want to hash out the universe and writing style first.

8. More ideas. Maybe I've got some big concepts wrong. Think the government will confiscate guns post-collapse? Lay out the case for it. If I'm convinced

**About me:**

I been reading survivalist stuff since I was six, revolutions, mostly from a historical perspective. Have always been interested in putting together a take on what a US collapse might look like, and I finally did it.

reasonably portable

* able to hold a decent charge

* relatively lightweight and stealthy

* 
as durable and low-maintenance as possible

* 
constructed mostly from readily available parts

multifunctional with multiple charge options (solar, etc)

able to produce enough power to charge a smartphone/laptop and a small appliance for at least an hour a day or at least a couple of times a week.

Socks! We never throw them out. If they get a hole in them we cut them off at the hole and wear them on our elbows or on our knees when it is cold out and we are wearing long clothing anyways. No one can see them and they are really really warm. I often cut a hole for my thumb and wear them as arm socks and pull gloves over them. They are great for sealing that gap between gloves and a coat sleeve. I have a few that I cut lengthwise and wear as a scarf/facemask. It's very breathable and warm.

I recently discovered that instead of buying undershirts to keep my core warm I can cut the sleeves off of my wifes worn out shirts and sweaters. I am 6'6"" and my wife is 5'5"" so her tiny shirts fit nice and snug under the rest of my clothes if I cut the sleeves off. My Turtleneck under-sweater is one of my new favorite clothing articles.

I dug up a collection of links from youtube about how to make the varying things one might need to create knives and tools cheap and easy.

Make Charcoal:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpDSbHZk

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0HW4qk8dv4

The essence of making charcoal is burning organic matter in a low/no oxygen environment.

Homemade Forge:

[Posting a youtube search results page](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=homemade+forge&amp;oq=homemade+forge&amp;gs_l=youtube.3..0l8j0i5l2.2986.6505.0.7383.14.9.0.4.4.0.144.976.2j7.9.0...0.0...1ac.Mtnv8Gyp9hE) because there wasn't a lot of crap videos to sort through. The results seem to cover the variety of decent ways.

The basics of a forge are blasting air into burning charcoal in order to heat metal.

When I made my knife I used a weber grill for the step of softening the steel. I put in charcoal

File Knife How-To Vids:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7r_2KUBP08

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjO2IyT6G20

The breakdown of how to make a file into a knife with the stock removal method is:

* Heat the file till it is non-magnetic or just heat the ever-loving shit out of it.

* Let it cool slowly. 

* The metal should be soft now

* Cut the shape you want with a hack saw or whatever. Grind or file the grind and the edge. 

* Now heat it up until a magnet won't stick to it and quench it straight down, but I did three.

* Sharpen

My first attempt at this produced an ugly as sin knife. But it holds an edge and can shave arm hair or carve wood. I used a bastard file so the handle was already there. Then for simplicity's sake I just cut a diagonal line across the steel

For example lets take this [700w Microwave](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202868488/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1&amp;keyword=Microwave&amp;storeId=10051&amp;superSkuId=203153360#specifications).

I understand 700w is a lot of juice

So if you have a 2000w/5000w inverter

What is the consumption? What would be the formula?

Or what if I had four 17w LED lightbulbs? That's 68wh right? So a 130w solar panel would store time and a half for it at peak conditions

Regarding deep cycle batteries... are most inverters only designed for 12v batteries? Is there an advantage in a household context to going up to 24v? And I'm not sure how to interpret battery specs [like these](http://www.zappworks.com/battery_specs.htm).

So going with their [250 Model](http://www.zappworks.com/battery_prices.htm)

Adding batteries in series, 48) if I understand it. And more batteries mean less discharge and more cycle life?

So if one had six of those batteries they would have 18kWH?

So,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=784&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=8146846093883201126&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TXwRUNbSNY6k8gTzuoGIDw&amp;ved=0CIsBEPMCMAI).

So ideally they are putting out a combined 780w. We take away 20% of that for the inefficiency of the NiCd batteries, you can fill a battery in 4.8 hours. If half the light, double the hours (9.6).

Am I right? I understand I haven't factored in phantom voltage yet.

I dont know how far I think the collapse is, because I would love a place like this to live in as my primary home or retreat.  I would love to be off the grid in a stealthy way.  I dont know whether Solar Panels would be good for this as how do you put them somewhere no one can stumble across.  Ideally I want a place that someone can walk over and around and never know there was anyone around.  

I also have a feeling I would be more comfortable in a house below ground.  I guess I feel like it would be more sheltered both from the elements and bad guys(pre collapse bad guys).

It's not as silly as it sounds

A little background:

 - I live in a city.

 - I keep the bag in the boot of my car at all times.

 - I work in the CBD.

 - I live in a place where death by exposure to extreme heat or cold is not a realistic consideration.

 - I work on the assumption that I will *not* be able to drive my car back to my home

When I put those factors together and balance them out I start thinking ""chances are I'll either be at home

1311786577.0,j1b20,Hunting vs. farming for protein?,nonself,21,1,70,"I see a lot of posts on here about hunting in a post-collapse society.  But I wonder

As an alternative (and because I'm not much of a hunter myself), meaning it contains all the essential amino acids your body needs.  The soybean also has one of the highest percentages of protein by weight of any vegetable - [around 35%](http://www.uwex.edu/ces/crops/SoyProtein.htm)

Using conservative estimates for my area

Each bushel weighs [60 pounds](http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G4020)  So that's 1200 pounds of beans

For comparison

A mature buck yields [72 pounds of meat](http://www.butcher-packer.com/index.php?main_page=document_general_info&amp;cPath=36&amp;products_id=331)

So

The CDC says adult men can get by on [56 grams of protein per day](http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/protein.html), or you can round that up to one extended family ~ 2 parents, a grandparent or two, and a couple of kids.

So hunters

* How far would you have to roam to take in 23 deer per year?

* What impact would this have on the deer population in that area?

* How much ammo would be required?  (Average number of missed shots / number of shots to kill?)

* Are small game (squirrels / birds) more realistic as a food supply?  I haven't run the numbers on them yet...",self,t5_2sfb4,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/j1b20/hunting_vs_farming_for_protein/

Depending on the extent of collapse, water treatment, etc.).

One idea that someone brought up months ago in an unrelated discussion at /r/finance was honey.

Honey has many practical applications in a post-collapse world such as antiseptic ointment for cuts and the obvious caloric content. Another thing it's got going for it is that it can be preserved indefinitely (more or less) provided it is kept in a cool space like an underground cellar or cave.

It's also relatively cheap to stock up on currently so it's feasible to stash your own ""honey pots"" in preparation.
