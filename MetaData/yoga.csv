---------

To begin, and inspiring posts that are found here are a bright spot in the Reddit universe.

-------------

**Rule 1 Reminder**

Over the past few weeks

&gt; Play nice. This is a community of people that share an interest in yoga. It is meant to be a safe and accepting place that is free of judgement. Let's all try to keep it classy

**as of now this rule will be much more strictly enforced than it has been in the past**.  We are not trying to hamper discussion and debate on yoga topics

-----

**Yoga Selfies**

**The official moderator position on ‘selfies’ is that they will remain a part of this subreddit.** I went back through the last month of posts to the sub and found (approximately) 40-45 ‘selfies’ out of 350 posts.  This is right around 15% of the posts to the subreddit and they garner a [majority of all upvotes] (http://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all).  However

--------

**New Rule 4: Testing a compromise**

In an effort to make a compromise, and it only adds a few extra keystrokes for everyone else. At the end of these two weeks we will have a community discussion about the rule and what all the users think.  The mods do reserve the right to go against popular opinion.

------

**A note on ‘real yoga’**

There has been quite a lot of debate as to the definition of yoga on the sub recently and how that pertains to what is appropriate for posting here.  Reddit uses upvotes and downvotes for a reason

&gt; Everybody, there are many ""right"" answers, especially for people just starting out. (...)

&gt;Do me a favor. Try to focus more on expanding the ~~fitness~~*(yoga)* community as a whole than protecting your little corner of it.

-------

**Seeking regular content generators**

Finally, sutras, the limbs, and ‘yogic’ lifestyle.  If one of you, or a group of you, want to take the lead any of these or something else, please send me a PM or leave a note about it in the comments.

-----

Thanks to all of you for being awesome and giving this a read.

Namaste.

Definitions evolve. They always have and they always will

The best analogy I have for this is food. Take noodles. Noodles have existed and continue to exist in many different societies across the world. Its a type of unleavened dough, and dried in to many shapes. The noodles can be made from different things, cut into thousands of shapes and sizes, called many different things, and prepared a countless number of ways.

Some people like hearty thick noodles that feel like they stick to your bones and feed your soul. Some people enjoy the lighter noodles that rest easily in the stomach and make you feel good. Other people even enjoy noodles that make you work hard to eat them because they taste so good and are good for you. But you know what every one of those noodles does? They nourish you. People enjoy different types of noodles for different reasons but they are all getting you to that end goal of fullness. Hell, because you like it, and it will make you better for it.

Yoga is different things to different people. I get so stressed when people on this sub say ""YOGA IS THIS"" or ""YOGA IS THAT

Firstly, so I was too out of breath to respond.

The entire experience is what I would imagine a girl walking into a rugby club would be like. It was like a complete sex role reversal. As I was leaving, I invited them to go first - instead, they offered me to go first - like some kind of reverse 1950's chivalry. I went first out of the door. 

... now I'm a mid twenty's male, so when I got home my male house mates asked the natural question - some of them being aware of r/yogapants. Whilst I noticed the ladies in the room, I didn't want to be ""that guy"" and 5 minutes into it, I was focusing on my breathing so much I hardly noticed. I did get hit on by a cougar before the class though. All in all, regardless of sexuality, everyone was there for the same thing.

The hope is to start a discussion about the pose so we can all learn from each other and improve our respective practices. Even simple poses can create interesting discussions and if nothing else it may help you be a bit more present in that pose that week.

I know some of you like to post pictures so please feel free to share a pic of you in the pose

I'll be honest, I still felt like I had no idea what I was doing. My teacher would tell me you just mistake your way thru it. I didn't know much about sequencing other than sun salutations, you have to stick with it! 

The first 100 classes felt scary, what was I supposed to do with a lady 6 months pregnant who had never done yoga before in a multi level class?! We didn't cover specific special cases like man with only one leg. Every body is different and has all these expectations. After teaching 200 classes, more workshops, and another 6 months of my own 6 day a week Ashtanga practice, I started to feel ok. I had seen a fair amount of bodies and could identify muscles located on other people's bodies as opposed to just seeing them in a book. After 400 taught classes, I felt like I had developed a style. I realized that I had been practicing yoga for almost 10 years and teaching for two. Someone once told me you have to have an ego before you can get rid of it. I had cycled thru *holy shit I have no idea what I'm doing* -to- *oh maybe I know what I'm doing* -to- *nope still don't know what i'm doing* -to- *I need more training* -to- *at least I know this is dangerous.* 

No one just *POOFS* amazing yoga teacher, and be humble, just like when you practice on the mat. First, do no harm.

There are still negative nancys, don't practice quitting. If you want to be a yoga teacher, go for it! but realize it is a long path and the first few years will be difficult because you will be that new/inexperience/dangerous yoga teacher. Just like when you try a new pose, it will be hard; but when you keep at it, it will feel amazing.

1330910451.0,qhvt4,The Beginners guide to Yoga:  Lessons from a guy who has been at it for a while,,111,15,12,"I have decided to write a little guide about certain “things” in Yoga that I think might help people who are just starting out with it.  When I first started taking classes


#1  YOGA IS PURELY ABOUT YOU:
It’s exciting to do Yoga, don’t be judging the bigger one who is wheezing.  Get over yourself,  then get into yourself.  Yoga is about self-awareness… eventually.   Once you do more practices and get with the swing of the routine you will eventually notice things about how your body reacts.  You’ll notice things about your breathe, you’ll notice habits in your mind that come about not only while you’re in the practice but even outside when you think about it.  Stop thinking about outside factors – whether it be in the studio or in your personal life – and just focus on yourself doing this damn Warrior pose.  

Also, based on your own definition,  but Yoga should never physically hurt you, it should only challenge you.  It’s going show you how your body and mind work together.  Sometimes your body will be good to push hard, but there is going to be days where your body would rather lay in a Jacuzzi.  The great thing about Yoga is that it can accommodate both those moods and still reap benefits.  You wanna stretch hard hard?  Stretch hard?  You wanna rest your eyes and melt?  Rest your eyes and melt while you go through those poses.  Cause you can.  IT’S ABOUT YOU! 

 Yoga can be dangerous because people push themselves to extremes that they can’t handle.  Yoga is supposed to work you but it’s also meant to stabilize you.   I think everyone eventually finds one pose that they are decent at and hey


#2 YOGA IS A BALANCED WORK OUT
I’ll get around to the spine later.  First, but trust me, you’ll enjoy it 100 times more if you remember to keep breathing through it.   

EVERY TIME YOU MOVE IT SHOULD BE ON EITHER IN INHALE OR AN EXHALE.  Cool?  Seriously
You’re always breathing -  never holding your breathe - and you need to move into a pose on either an inhale or an exhale.  But all of a sudden the next pose comes out and you’re breathe is the opposite of what the instructor is saying.  WAIT UNTIL YOU NATURALLY GET INTO THAT BREATH AGAIN… okay?!… you need to breathe on the right spots to really get the full effects and to settle your body.  if you know you need to be going into something the next move with an inhale… then enjoy every damn second of your exhale, or how they got into it… just keep breathing and wait for a spot for you to get back into the pose.   Try your best to move on the rhythm of the in/ex and you will find some pretty interesting results.  Remember, it’s about you!

Final note on breath:  Every time you exhale you should “release” the tension in your body.  You know what I mean by that?  Let go of the vice grip that that section of the muscle has become.  Like releasing a clenched fist, doing a lunge, but somehow someway you’ll be able to let go of the unnecessary contractions that are still happening in your leg muscles.  And for some odd reason that feels incredible.  It’s weird because you will be using your muscles to hold up your weight, while also stretching and “releasing” them at the same time.   AND if your breath is in a good place you’re going to be doing all these feats with a breathe rate moving slower than molasses.   


#3 THE SPINE:
A lot of Yoga is about the spine.  You twist it
A final note on spines:  A lot of Yoga’s full body work out comes because of its focus on the spine.  Every time you bend forward your teacher will probably have a bend backward.  This is important not only for physical development


#3.1  STAY AROUND FOR THAT FINAL RESTING POSE:
You more than likely have just put your spine through hell and back… Lie on it for ten minutes okay?  Disagree with me if you want, if you’re like me and don’t care for some of that other stuff, then please do it for your back.   I guarantee that you will feel your it kind of reset itself while you’re lying there.  You’ll be in such a blissful state, hardly thinking a thought, that it won’t be so bad anyways.  So just chill and make sure you’re back has had a couple of moments to just melt into the floor before you get up.  Do what you want when you rest on your back.  Keep your eyes open or closed.  Chant or don’t chant, get internal or get external.   But stick around for at 5 but preferably 15 minutes.  And if you’re doing it at home, then there should be no excuse.  Build it into your schedule.

Last tip:  Downloading Yoga videos is a good way to learn.  It’s the exact same routine.  You’ll learn things.

Okay that’s it!  I honestly think these are the most important things to know to really develop an understanding of what Yoga can become.   I hope you guys enjoy it and would love to hear other people’s comments about things they find are important to know but don’t seem to be expressed in classes.

All this time I've been going to either classes that are meant for ""ALL LEVELS"" or that says ""1-2 Level.""

I finally went to a level 2-3 class.  Found it to be exactly what I've wanted.  No.  Exactly what I've *needed.*  It was the best class I've taken in at least a year and wish I did it earlier. But then again

So anyway

I was just on the ground, I should try floating forward with my hips up high cause I didn't try it at all in the class to conserve energy.  ([I have been practicing this move for months, demonstrated by this video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_ZGXWfgOhQ))

I just hopped my hips up and my legs were straight and instead of bringing them down between my hands

So that was an **incredible** personal breakthrough for me.  I just did a handstand.  And it just happened. And it was all thanks to me being so mentally destressed that I didn't even think about what to do

Then I stretched my wrists out more and decided to *try* the [peacock pose](http://www.yogaposeweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tumblr_laikbfOJA71qdz0zlo1_12801.jpg-stefan.jpg).  I had tried it before but would always collapse my core so my legs wouldn't straighten and I'd be scared my face was going to hit the ground.  But I did it

Then there was a 1"" slackline setup in the park, I end up falling right after I turn around.  This time, again, I just did it and I didn't fall, I was completely still and ready to walk forward the other way.  That was the third breakthrough.

All this happened within half an hour time.  I felt like I was on top of the world.  Stuff I had been working on for months and months just all clicked all together in that hour.  And I believe it was all thanks to that yoga session.  YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!

I've been practicing yoga for just over year now, very down, thanks to various other shit that seems to be happening to me at this stage of my life. Probably more down than I should be, but that's just me.

Anyway, at least, my own version of using yoga to get in touch with something deeper than just stretching and balancing. 

I felt I was having some kind of panic attack (it has happened once before) so I felt the need to rush out of the house. I needed to do something to distract myself from what seems to me like incoming depression... So I took my mat with me. I live in a small rural village, but after a year, I had a couple of routines ingrained in me. I stopped thinking, and just concentrated on smoothness, on my breathing, on what I was doing with my body and on (sounds wacky) my heart. 

Things get wackier from here, keeping focused and trying not to think, something odd happened inside me. In what felt like a second, I could feel some kind of passion inside that felt so raw it was like I was in a rage, but it was a positive, determined energy. This was an energy that I've never felt before, and it was an energy focused on exactly that moment, or that exhale. After about 30 seconds my legs gave way and I fell to my box

I really can't explain in much more detail what I experienced, but it was like I was experiencing that MOST INTENSE FEELING IN THE WORLD that is crying about something that is fucking emotionally life changing for you. But in a positive way..... Like I was balling my eyes out in a determined way. Fuck it's so hard to explain. I sat up and opened my eyes, let the wind blow in my face.

Just read all this back and it sounds so dumb....

But, and I can't wait to start.... 

Honestly, but fuck me it's weird!

Cheers :-)

I am currently deeply contemplating a move to either Colorado or Washington to start a yoga studio that would be entirely 420 friendly. I have a lot of experience combining the two and they are wonderful together. I feel that marijuana makes people more open to the practice as well as promotes deeper relaxation.

Yes, I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing and I really do believe marijuana is a wonderful medicine.

I envision the studio as being a combination of outdoor as well as indoor studio and I would promote an environment of true openness, and the weed would be a part of this experience.

I have noticed, and the front page is stagnant. So why don't we change this up?

/r/fitness is a perfect example. Every week many threads are posted following a particular theme:
Moronic Monday. Ask a stupid question! Ask something that is in the FAQ if you don't have the time to look it up yourself. We can use this format! Those mat questions and asking about what to expect as a new yogi.
Formcheck Friday. This would be a great tradition! We can help other yogis that are unsure of their forms
I cannot remember the other thread name

We can even take this further by choosing a weekly asana to work towards

I'm sorry if this offends anyone

Try to have fun with these ideas

Sorry mods

Edit: Okay guys! Mods have been messaged and are giving us the go to start things up on our own. We are a community anyway

So far I've read lots of love for the asana of the week. The really cool thing about most asanas is that each one can be done 3 different ways! This opens up practice in such a way that you can build a unique sequence for yourself in order to reach that pose. I think that if we give an asana of the week, I'm a little lost and would love some input. I feel like this is a more mod related addition to the subreddit or someone should be designated in choosing the asana of the week.

Now, but if a Wednesday thread is wanted, perhaps every day threads are wanted? Or should we keep them to specific days in order to keep them special and not as chorelike? If we are going through with a Wednesday thread keep in mind that Wednesdays are midweek markers, which means downtime is almost here. Perhaps we should have a thread themed around that idea!

Ideas for other days:
 I for one like Mindfulness Monday. Talk about an observation you've made or share something special with us! During my teacher training

Perhaps Wednesdays can be our day to talk about our accomplishments whether it's finally holding headstand or realizing that mountain pose is more than just standing still. Getting through half of a week is an accomplishment after all!

I did like the Foodie Friday, and reserve a separate day for food. We have 7 days of the week!

We still need a day for form checking or asana advice. These two can be grouped into the same thread. Let me know if you have ideas!

I'm not the authority here

I will now keep track of upvotes as a way of saying that you like that idea. We also need to nominate users to get threads started so we don't have 5 different posts of the same thread! Perhaps we can introduce a yogi of the week

Edit2: The threads I listed are not permanent decisions at the moment. They are suggestions. Please give me your ideas. Fridays are so open for different names and themes (See above). We should all make the decision together,False,,t5_2qhq6,1357107611.0,,,t3_15qslg

After some time though, mildly paranoid, couldn't focus, stopped dreaming, and just really hated how shit was going. I stopped smoking, and within a day the symptoms got better. After a week of quitting smoking I felt amazing once again. 

I guess that I'm writing this kind of as a warning. I'm not saying to not smoke pot, we must realize that no drug can replace conscious, free-minded action. Although we may be tempted to get high as a means to get closer to ourselves, drugs do not do this. When we get high, we feel that our hearts are open, and that we can love ourselves and everything around us. This feeling, however, rather than a way of getting in touch with our true natures.

So, nor enlightening, nor a way of getting in touch with myself. At best, it can temporarily trigger an altered state of mind that helps us to identify negative patterns in our bodies and consciousness. The point, I suppose, is to realize that getting high on a consistent basis will set you back emotionally and psychologically and will lead to you having to struggle to quit.

I tried lifting my right leg over my right arm, and holding myself up and to no avail I could hold the pose.

My intention was to accept and appreciate myself. I've always suffered a lot from self-esteem and I want my yoga to help me appreciate who I am personally. So I set a mental note - ""appreciate yourself"".

A short while into the class we were going through some flows and something came to me - a very clear thought that felt just amazing for me personally. In that moment it was a true appreciation for who I was as an individual. 

I was practicing next to one of the other yoga instructors in the studio. Of course

But then I realized that she would never be able to feel yoga in the same way that I was feeling it right there. My own body and my own set of circumstances has led me to practice yoga, and NO ONE else can ever understand that, or feel it. In that moment I realized that my postures were MINE. That they were perfect the way they were because they were ME. My halfway lift is MY HALFWAY LIFT and I am the only person who'll ever experience or know it. 

It felt like this amazing sense of appreciation for my own body and my own experience

I've been working a lot on self-acceptance lately - it's been a bit of a pet project. I have to say that Yoga has helped me immensely in this manner and I greatly

I have done yoga on and off briefly for a few years now. I am very inflexible and extremely out of shape. I also have a pretty severe depression. This lead to me having a lot of trouble in classes and being easily discouraged. At the end of the yoga practices I felt more like crying because I felt I couldn't even keep up with a beginner practice

I found my solution. 

I happened upon [this type of naked yoga](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Undressed-Collection-Beginner-Intermediate/dp/0982982259/ref=pd_cp_mov_1). It was all about accepting your body

Anyway, (checking out what else I would do once I could make it further into the video) and ended my session. 

I felt great. I know that I thought of it for a brief moment as ""giving up, and I thanked myself for not only taking the time to try and be healthier, but also for thinking more positively. I plan on doing the practice often. With every minute more I can make it through the video, I have improved. Every time I watch and practice I am making an active decision to love myself, embrace my body, and heal from the years of not exercising and junk food. For once I am proud, and for that I thank yoga. 

Meanwhile It really is a good series and I encourage all of you to try it (although the men might find it weird when the narrator is telling them to embrace their inner goddess.)",,t5_2qhq6,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aenc4/finally_found_a_starting_point_apparently_doing/

Recently I've been going through some tough shit, and grasping at anything in life to help me up. Then I found a coupon online for a free WEEK of bikram yoga! 

This was great because I've always wanted to do a yoga class, wonderful staff, little yogi store, and huge open rooms.  When I checked in, they were extraordinarily happy and welcoming and gave me a tour. I felt honored that they would take time out of their days to do this (and so close to class time too!).

I was surprised to see that the age range and the body type of the people in the class was of a wide variety.  Probably late teens - 60s.  Overweight and ultra-skinny. Very fit and not fit at all.  Came into the room (heated to 90 degrees), fake candles lit on the floors. Beautiful and peaceful.  I laid down my mat and took some deep calming breaths.  

That was the first time I have ""breathed"" in a way that helped me in a very long time.  My anxiety started to melt. I felt clear.

The poses were a bit difficult, sometimes having to modify a pose, so I felt very at ease. I kept pushing myself, and I am very proud of that.  She repeated quotes of ""daring greatly"" and allowing yourself to become vulnerable to people and experiences. 

At the end of the class

I almost had a cryfest meltdown at the studio, I could think clearly and calmly.  No more crying fits of panic, sitting in my closet at home.  Tonight is more peaceful and I feel proud that I took the chance and went to the class.

I'll be going more often in the future.  If you're hesitant about going - please do. You will never know how much it can help you until you take the first step.

TLDR; I have high anxiety and took the plunge into day 1 of yoga and LOVED it. Tonight I feel much more calm and haven't cried all day.  Looking forward to more classes. ",,t5_2qhq6,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1g3pea/reflections_of_a_yoga_n00b_day_1_of_bikram_yoga/

""I hoped I wasn't going to be the only man here""
She responds be saying ""Haha yoga's a pretty feminine thing so I wouldn't expect too many guys"". This made me feel even more self-conscious.

Eventually everyone else arrives outside and as I'd began to suspect I was the only guy. Still being as positive as I could be I went in and followed by example of how to set up. I ended up in the middle of the room and realised everyone else had taken their socks off.
Now from playing american football
I was feeling quite awful at that point and then one of the employees walked in telling us that the Instructor wouldn't be able to make it tonight. I pack up asap and leave.

I was really quite keen on starting Yoga but now i'm not quite sure if i'm gonna book into another session

Yesterday I competed for the first time at the Florida Regional Yoga Asana Championship. I can honestly say

I had struggled with going and participating for months. I wasn't attracted to the idea of being judged about my practice. However, but the people were kind. By Saturday night, I was exhausted and inspired.

Sunday morning @745 I took a class from one of my old teachers that had flew in from Texas for the competition. We showered, everyone was helping everyone. I hugged strangers, watched their routines for them, calmed them, made them laugh, and many of them did the exact same for me. While practicing my routine on the stage, I must have looked a bit nervous because the gentleman who was practicing next to me reached over and hugged me without saying a word. It helped

[I went on the stage around 4pm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTak2kkUFR8)

Turns out, I had no idea what ""open"" felt like so there was nothing to compare to feel ""stuck"" or ""sticky"" places.  Right below my shoulder blades - maybe better described as behind my ribs? - seems to be resisting the stretch at the moment.

Yesterday was my hardest motivational moment.  I was in the sun all day, I had 7 minutes to leave the house to make class.  But I did.  This came as a huge surprise to me.  I got up and went to class, grumbling and muttering ""stupid fuckin yoga challenge"" under my breath, but I went.  And it was awesome.  It was a hard class and it was wicked hot in the studio but once I stepped on my mat, I was overwhelmed with gratitude that I made it.

* if you have a usual flow

* turn off the lights (although i wouldn't recommend complete blackness because that seems a little dangerous for my taste

* if you wear glasses or contacts

* naked!

* face a different direction/ practice in a different room

* put on music/turn off music/ use music you never would usually (rap! classical! punk! jazz!)

My usual routine is to train in the gym three days a week(barbell work

-- Running for CV fitness

-- Yoga for balance/flexibility/core strength

What's the effect of yoga on muscle building and overall strength (I know it's great for balance

I've made good progress in the gym and am considering switching out one or more of those sessions for more intensive yoga work and was wondering what the effects would be - It's hard to fit in three gym visits

TLDR: Yogis (who also lift?) - do you view your yoga workout like a weights session or not? Does yoga *also* build/maintain muscle and strength?

Many times we had no idea what pose we were doing because he kept telling us to lift the wrong leg or move in the wrong direction. Very hard to keep up. 

And then he wanted all of us to do handstands...with a partner. Many people had to sit out because they were too old or too injured or just not comfortable with inversions.  It seemed he was asking too much out of a free class with people he's never worked with before. 
He also spent 10 minutes showing off his abilities to do handstands in the middle of the room. Kept coming back down

When a yogi starts to understand the deeper principles of Yoga, it’s easy for someone to think that one’s level in Yoga is based entirely on their flexibility. But it is simply not true. I would like to offer you three supremely great influences in the history of yoga, all of which oppose the idea that Yoga = Flexibility.

1326533862.0,ognnt,My yoga journey thus far; thank you r/yoga,sunstorm77,36,7,1,"I discovered yoga in high school via the library. I borrowed the books and whenever I had a few minutes alone

I didn't have the money for classes, my mental focus was often more on all the things that were constantly raging through my mind. It wasn't a quieting, relaxing practice, it was still just a series of movements.

I went through the movements of yoga like this almost every day for close to five years. Then the depression that I had battled since childhood finally got the better of me and I stopped. I gained weight. I stopped even thinking about it. After a few years of that, but as soon as I got into a relationship again, I allowed myself to get sidetracked and I stopped even doing that again. I gained weight again and this time, things went horribly wrong.

Six years ago, spinal cord degradation, and osteoarthritis in my neck and lower back. I was told my bones resembled those of someone twice my age. I was abused as a child and there were numerous things that jarred my spine that probably contributed to this, in addition to five car accidents and years of not minding my own physical limits out of sheer stubbornness [and stupidity].

I had gone to several doctors about my back, they didn't take me as seriously as they would now for the same complaints. 

I eventually decided to try a chiropractor and he actually took x-rays! My spine was a mess; it looked like it was spiraling and about to fall over. I had three ribs out of place, walking, roller blading in high school and college, bicycling, hiking. Now I was practically immobile because it just hurt too much to move. I would wake up, not because I was finished sleeping, but because I was too stiff and hurt too much to keep laying there.

By this point, I was feeling MUCH better and able to breathe freely for the first time in a couple of years. I tried to do some yoga, but I couldn't even do simple things. Child pose hurt my arms and I couldn't breathe. Cat/cow felt like I was being stabbed. I forward folded with my hands on my knees, and every time I moved, I got major head rush. I had to slow down.

For four years, sleep, and get through a whole day and still be able to hold myself up at the end of it. As ridiculous as this sounds, it took me four years to be able to manage those things consistently again, but I was afraid of taking the next step for fear of doing it wrong and hurting myself all over again in some fun new way. I did NOT want to go back to immobility again!

But I was tired of the extra weight I'd picked up over the years, I spent a portion of my evening on the floor, moving however it felt best, stretching whatever I could stretch, holding whatever I could hold and at least trying this and that. I picked through some videos for simple things I could work on. One day I happened upon a class listing for our local community center and discovered they hosted an affordable yoga class that billed itself as a good way to gain flexibility and relieve stress, so I signed up for it. (It was kripalu, for those who are interested)

That was a year and a half ago. In the past year and a half,  to help myself keep posture when I find myself slouching too much. However, I'm also able to hold myself up longer and much more upright than I could before. I have flexibility that I haven't possessed in years (though I'm still a far cry from where I was) and I have learned how to use yoga (with supervision from my teacher and my chiropractor) to relieve spinal pressure and slowly rebuild back muscle so my bones will stay where they belong better.

And it's that last that has me writing this tonight. I've had so many accomplishments through my yoga practice over the past year and a half, I was able to rest in extended child and take deep, full breaths and not feel my rib start to shift out of place. I've acknowledged my limits (both in and out of class) and know what a slipping rib feels like, so I've always been very careful, but today I was able to go for the full stretch and... NOTHING.  It felt AMAZING!!! I almost cried. It felt SO GOOD!!

A year and a half ago, I do 90 minute sets of [mostly] flowing, meditative yoga and though I still feel aches and have days when I just don't feel good, none of it is as bad as when I was laying on the couch because I couldn't breath and it hurt to sit up. I've even started being able to jog a little!

I apologize; I know I'm rambling a bit and this is mostly stream of consciousness, and my energy levels in the last couple of months and I'm so excited. I feel like this practice is giving me my life back and I thought I'd share it with you guys because, without ever knowing it, you've done so much to help keep me on track. Your posts have kept yoga in my face every day, and on my mind, so that even when I couldn't get out of the chair, it was still there, but to better quality of life.

1369423768.0,1ezm2f,Trying to bring one foot directly between your hands from downward dog but falling short? Here's some help...,Antranik,32,0,8,"Here's the scenario

I have always struggled with this because my foot would come up short or I'd have to move my hand out of the way.  But I've been getting better.  Here's some things that are helping me.

I've realized it takes two things to make this happen: **Flexible hips and a strong core.**

1. Hips: If you're inflexible

2. Core: *Waaay too many* teachers ask you to go into down-dog, if you get beginners used to doing that, it doesn't make for a good foundation because they won't understand the crucial steps to get the foot up front.  If you're flexible and have no problem with that, GREAT, but for someone inflexible like me, I can't just swing my foot forward an use the momentum like that.  Besides, that's cheating. :p

**So what do you do to use the core?**

1. Go in downward dog.

1. Really press the floor away from you using your hands (activate the triceps)

1. Then bring the right knee toward your nose

      Hold your knee up to your nose for 2-3 breaths

1. Then *slowly* but very deliberately

So the point is to break the movement down into these simple steps and take your sweet time really perfecting the details.  This will engage your core in a new way and get your [hip flexors](http://www.fitorfake.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/hip-flexor.jpg) to be much stronger and you won't be overcompensating using other muscles.",,t5_2qhq6,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1ezm2f/trying_to_bring_one_foot_directly_between_your/

------------------------------------------------------------
Recently, I'll call her...""Petunia"", really wants to go down the yoga rabbit hole so to speak, but she's intimidated by thought of being splayed-out, sweaty and inflexible in front of a room full of strangers, uncertain as to what asana to do next, or if she’d even be ABLE to do whatever asana comes next. 

Yeah

Ok

Aaaaand breathe…but I digress… 

So I said to her, because the pot o’ gold at the other end is completely worth it”. 

Your damn ego.

And that got me to thinking, but are afraid to give it a go because they let their ego dictate their desire?” Probably quite a few and most of them are guys. And that’s über-sad because that same attitude probably applies to most new endeavors in their lives that they’d like to try, but they’ve unconsciously chosen let their frightened ego sit in the driver’s seat. 

So I decided to jot down a few tips that you might want to consider next time you want to try something new. Yes

One: You just have to go in with no expectations of what you will be able to

Honestly
 
Two: There is a saying in yoga: “Honor your limits”.

That’s means to pay attention to what your body is telling you and adjust accordingly. And don’t push past what you feel is safe because your ego is telling you that you have to be able to stretch to a certain point. You can’t and you won’t
 
Three: You are your own teacher and your own student. 

The onus is on you to learn as much as you can, someone will be at the front of the room leading the flows and asanas and adjusting your body if necessary, but think of them as a guide - a sherpa if you will - helping you to navigate the terrain of your own mind, body, and connection with the Universe.
 
Four: If you’re super-newbie

Chances are you will hurt yourself or will become so exhausted and frustrated that you never try yoga again. That’s not the goal we have in mind for you little baby bird. Look for a nice
 
Five: Still intimidated? That’s fine. Go buy a $20 yoga mat and a DVD and work on your practice at home first until you feel you have the courage to attend your first class. 

That’s what most people tend to do anyway. That way, and I’m pretty darn sure that Mr. Tinklepuss is too busy tending to his own bits and pieces to care about yours.
 
So that’s it. That’s what I’m putting out there today. That’s my simple little contribution to the world for the moment. Take from it what you will and move forward. Find the courage to either go to a class or whip out that credit card and get a starter mat. Don’t let imaginary fears rule your life
 
...breathe and move forward…

The bad part is that I have to go to the class or I would risk getting a bad grade and have it affect my GPA. 

I guess I'm not sure how to approach the class. It seems like the focus is all core strength

An example of a class:
We lie flat on our backs for about 10 minutes. Then, with no flow or transition (or anything to release the pressure we just put on our backs), we flip around and do some planks. My teacher claims that we should feel absolutely so pressure in our hands/wrists, and that we are holding ourselves up with our core (which I'm pretty sure is physically impossible at that angle...). And then literally, that is it. One or two moves the entire session.

Is this a style of yoga I just am not used to? Is there something I should do to prepare so I don't keep straining my back and knees? It just seems like we are constantly putting pressure on a specific area the entire hour and then doing nothing to stretch and relieve it.

ITS YOGA PRACTICE.

I signed up for an introductory week of unlimited bikram for 10 dollars. The first day, but I got very tired. It was sooo hot and my body was not cooling down! I was drenched with sweat and I just felt miserable. I layed down on my mat and determined that I would not leave until it was over, even if I layed down for the rest of the session. I came around when the breathing exercises started. Afterwards, I layed down for another 15 minutes. I got through it! I had completely soaked my towel and I could have wrung sweat from it. I was very drained afterwards. I ate a light meal, had some beers and went to bed.

The next day, I dropped it by 40 pounds because I was feeling so week. I did 380lb for 4 reps instead of 420lb for 5.

The next day, I was on my back and I started to feel my left arm tingle. Then, my right arm. Then my legs started to tingle. Finally my lips and face started to tingle. I could tell my entire body was starting to feel tingly. I spoke up, but my voice was weak. I told the instructor I was feeling tingly all over. She brought me a drink that was lemony / salty and I just laid there trying to recover while she went over the next 14 movements. I wanted to bolt, but my body could not move. I was still lying there 20 minutes after the session was over. Got up, felt very dizzy and layed down for another 5 minutes. Got up again, had to make very slow determined movements to get to the shower and cool off and go home. I downed a burger, gatorade and a chocolate bar

I drink about a gallon of water per day. I am scared to come back to bikram yoga now. What changes do I need to make so I can survive or even trhive in a bikram yoga environment?

Wish me luck :S

**UPDATE ON HOW IT WENT**
Basically, we cherish our time during practice, we remain calm, we try to focus, etc... However, teenagers demand WAY too much attention to have a typical yoga class. Trying to cater to their instant gratification needs was very difficult. In the end, the ones that goofed off, but many started seeing the value of a good yoga practice after doing a few sun salutations. Some were actually tired out (which is exactly where they started thinking ""Oh this might actually be hard"". Understandably, they just seem to pop out the most). The boys (most of them are hockey boys) were wayyy into it; I paid particular attention to them, as they were the most receptive and required the most help. The best parts of the practice were the breathing exercises in the beginning

tl;dr: First class ever teaching, went a bit too quickly, but I survived. Kids take really well to meditation. ",,False,,t5_2qhq6,,http://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/p7qep/ryoga_im_about_to_teach_my_first_yoga_class_in_25/

I live in NYC and yoga seems to be everywhere and living in this city and not being active can turn you into a couch potatoe. So I got to class and found out that not only did I not feel judged but I loved the feeling of using your body and waking all your muscles up. I also started feeling calmer and happier during the day. I went almost 5 times a week until it got to cold and I stopped going to class. I started feeling sick and sluggish and I decided it was time for me to get back into it. I went to my first class today and as I sit here still sore and alittle disappointed in myself (I didnt try 100% and the feeling of weakness is run over my body just like my first class ever)  but I feel amazing and I have a lot of hope for the future.

This is kind of interesting because I obviously don’t feel like I’m doing that much. Sure


This is my schedule so far:

Monday – Brazilian Jiu Jitsu 1hr 30 minutes

Tuesday – Rest day

Wednesday – Ashtanga Primary series 1hr 45 minutes

Thursday – Intro or modified ashtanga Primary Series  1 hr 30 minutes

Friday – Rest day

Saturday – Primary Series 1hr 45 minutes

Sunday – Super Intro Ashtanga class 60 minutes (because my friends are still doing this one and it’s light exercise)


Ideally


What do you guys think? Is this really “so much”? I mean

I've been lurking here for a while and have dabbled in beginner's yoga

Recently, found a link on youtube called Hatha Yoga Flow 3, and went at it. 
After 40 minutes

I would like to continue to use yoga to treat my anxiety. Where can I start? Are there specific asanas or a guided video I can work with that target quieting your mind in particular? Or really any type that someone thinks would be helpful to my situation. 

Thank you for any information. Like I said

Edit: It seems the verdict is that almost any type of yoga works wonders for stress, and I'm eager to continue with my own journey. Thank you so much for taking the time to read/respond. ",,False,,t5_2qhq6,1368069075.0,,
