First of all I would like to say thank you for visiting the grumpycat community. Your foul mood is much appreciated. 

Okay
It's October! Which means: pumpkins, black cats everywhere are at risk, and....

**Cats in Costumes!**

That's right, wearing various hats and uncomfortable business wear. Always wanted a pet turtle, but not ready for the commitment? Well then, why not *make believe* and anger someone in the process! Ready your cameras, because ^once ^someone ^figures ^out ^how, **the cat costume with the most foul expression and most grumpvotes will grace the sidebar for an extended period of time.** (Until we figure out what fun ways we can lovingly torture our felines in honor of turkey day.) 

##Also

ALSO...please, or else it's going to get boring. If it's a cat that's been floating around for a while, we're gonna just ignore it. FOR EXAMPLE... most of you don't actually know Tard. Tard mom (or related) should be the only one using Tard as an entry. We want to encourage you to interact with the local mammalian population..... battle wounds are cool. 

If this is a big flop



Whatever
