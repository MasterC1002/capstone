&gt;Police 1: let me see your hands
&gt;
&gt;Me: what?
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: let me see your hands!
&gt;
&gt;Me: here they are. (nothing in them)
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: Put your hands on the steering wheel!
&gt;
&gt;Me: OK OK
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: What are you doing tonight?
&gt;
&gt;Me: Just out dumpster diving seeing if I can find anything of interest.
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: Did you find anything good?
&gt;
&gt;Me: No the only thing of interest was a picture frame outside of the dumpster
&gt;deemed garbage.
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: I see. Could you step out of the car?
&gt;
&gt;Me: No problem

At this point two more patrol cars pull up lights flashing.

&gt;Police 1: Put your hand on your hood.
&gt;
&gt;Me: OK (putting my hands on the hood getting ready to be searched)
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: I said head
&gt;
&gt;Me: Oh sorry I thought you said hood.

I will leave out the drug banter and illegal items.

&gt;Police 1: Why are you dumpster diving?
&gt;
&gt;Me: Because as odd as it sounds I enjoy it.
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: OK? Are all these items in your backseat yours? (referring to my fishing
&gt;
&gt;Me: Yes they are mine.
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: Why do you have three laptops?
&gt;
&gt;Me: I work in IT.
&gt;
&gt;Police 2: So you work in IT and you dumpster dive?
&gt;
&gt;Me: Yea
&gt;
&gt;Police 2: Ok

One cop starts ripping through my car trying to find anything they can.

&gt;Police 2: Whats in the backpack?
&gt;
&gt;Me: There are two fish in the main compartment
&gt;just got done getting searched at the river
&gt;
&gt;Police 2: You seriously have fish in a backpack?
&gt;
&gt;Me: Yes
&gt;
&gt;Police 2: You've got a pretty interesting life...
&gt;
&gt;Me: That's how I like it.
&gt;
&gt;The other cop is done searching and starts walking over.
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: Whats with all the cereal in the front seat?
&gt;
&gt;Me: I made a big score at Aldi just a minute ago
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: So you didn't buy these?
&gt;
&gt;Me: (gulping and thinking oh fuck) Correct.  They were in the dumpster being prepared to be sent to the dump.
&gt;
&gt;Police 2: But you didn't take anything outside of the dumpster?
&gt;
&gt;Me: No sir
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: Correct
&gt;
&gt;Me: No

At this point it's going great.  I've got 3 patrol cars

I watch police 1 + 2 talking in front of their squad car

&gt;Police 1: We can't seem to find a threat here
&gt;
&gt;Police 2: We get a call every night about this dumpster.  An overly concerned neighbor seems to be spying the dumpster.
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: You are free to go.  Just be safe and stay out of trouble.
&gt;
&gt;Me: You literally get a call every night?
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: Yep never fails... (they both agree with an upset look)
&gt;
&gt;Me: wow
&gt;
&gt;Police 2: We would definitely appreciate it
&gt;
&gt;Me: Deal
&gt;
&gt;Police 2: Don't forget that laptop on the roof of your car!

&gt;Me: Aww shit

It feels really good to leave a little

I would recommend everyone subscribed to this sub to try it some time. Explain the idea to your other diving friends

But

I've been diving in dumpsters for a few years as a sideline activity, I'd look for things I could donate to my friend's thrift store. She'd get them free, and could sell them for a dollar or two. And I felt like I was making a small contribution to the effort to save our planet. Win-win, all the way.

I remember one late night a couple years ago, and refreshes their pies periodically as well. In the process, they throw away a LOT of stuff, BUT... they also have a policy of not donating these to *anywhere*... so it all goes into the dumpster. Nightly. As I said, I made a mental note and moved on. I didn't need all that sugar and fat.

A couple months ago

I lost my less-than-part-time job that was keeping sufficient supplemental food on my plate (supplemental to the food banks and soup kitchens). When this happened

I remembered the Krispy Kreme encounter and decided that I was now hungry enough to check dumpsters for food - which I had never done before. 

I started with the convenience store.

While I missed the Krispy Kreme guy, fattening, glorious morsels of breakfast goodness.

Shortening what has now become a long story and could get even longer if I included all of the details

As time passed, hotdogs and bratwurst sausages and other items from their hot grill, etc.). And, she has also adjusted the way she goes about doing her nightly chores. I rarely have coffee grounds mixed with dry food in the same bag - she separates those quite frequently now. And, the last few mornings, she's made sure there have been a few extra bratwurst sausages (like 4 or 5) every morning.

She's only about 20 years old, I had to find out her name. Not for any creepy reason. But, rather, because I wanted to leave a note for her manager this coming holiday season, expressing my sincere thankfulness for this young lady. As hopeful as I am that this most humble (and humiliating) time of life will be brief, this young lady has made it much more tolerable.

As I was saying...  I had enough money to buy myself a real cigar (I normally smoke ""refry"" - butts re-rolled into roll-your-own) and a soda refill. I became a real customer this morning

If you haven't guessed

I hope I never forget my breakfast at Tiffany's

Thank you

EDIT: I want to thank everyone who commented for their wise and insightful responses. I am in no rush ... especially not a rush to make any mistakes or to harm this young lady's life in any way. I will think these things over very thoroughly before I make any gestures of gratitude other than a polite thank you (as I have done the few times when she was taking out trash while I was digging in the dumpster).

Anyways, instead of a right turn to head home. I wanted to see, shits and giggles, if a store I visited once before still had a chain and lock on their skip enclosure (10 foot high walls and doors). 
I didn't like checking this place out last time because it was well lit, I drove down a block and around to pull in to the dark neighborhood behind. I grabbed a few big heavy duty bags with me (just in case) and walked over. The back of the store wasn't very lit, but I had my flashlight to light the bike path to the store side.

Cars drove by once every minute or so. I didn't want to be seen because I've been surprised by police vehicles checking me out because someone reported suspicious behavior (reason I parked a block away). 
I looked over to the gate - just my luck
I scooted in and closed the door behind me. I made note of the doors being just wood slats
I spent the next 45 minutes ""shopping"". 

I ended up with 6 large bags of  (mainly dairy) groceries:

* Piles of yogurt (28lbs *[13kg]* of assorted sizes and flavors of yogurt from 3.5oz *[100g]* to 23oz *[650g]* containers)
* Milk of all kinds/percentages/flavours (bags and cartons totaling 8 gallons *[30L]*)
* About 100 eggs (a few were cracked and some missing from cartons) 
* Several boxes of cookies and crackers 
* And a couple boxes of ""fancy"" chocolates

The funniest part, but I didn't have any more bags and I didn't want multiple trips back and forth.

Started out a crappy night

I did a double take on the eggs. All 100 (minus broken ones) are good. I mistook the abbreviation for May as March. I've given half of them away..No way I can eat all that by myself - and the point of this was to try to avoid wasting perfectly good food.

I figured the dumpstergods wanted to tell me something.

I took a look and sitting there, so I hurried back and got my girlfriend to come along. This is what we got (Only counting stuff in good condition):

 - 13 different assortments of bread
 - Olives
 - Capers
 - A big hunk of meat (It's freezing outside
 - 5 bottles of assorted dip for salad
 - 12 flower bouquets
 - Potatoes. Got 10 kg of potatos!
 - Shrimp salad and lots of salmon pate (Not sure about these
 - Brown sugar
 - Tomatoes
 - Citrus fruits... Limes everywhere!
 - Bananas!
 - A variety of different herbs
 - 5 bags with mixed different salads.

This list is just off the top of my head, and can last until summer, and a lot of the stuff was like that. If they keep the dumpster unlocked, and if there's the same amount every week, we could literally cut our food budget down to 0$.

I'm amazed that this is possible

Anyway

EDIT: Oh

**EDIT2**: As promised, meat, and some of the flowers. The meat is really high quality and had a punctured package, but I figure it's OK, because the last sale date is in the future, and there's frost outside.

**EDIT3:** So here's a picture of my first [dumpster meal](http://imgur.com/a/EuRkZ). Can't believe that it's possible to get this good food for 0$. And it's not something I'd make normally myself either. Tomorrow It'll be meatballs with potatoes,False,self,t5_2qy4c,1358545984.0,,,t3_16si9g

I've been MIA

I just wanted to add my latest find (as in

I'm now the proud owner of a white GE microwave-model JES1334WD man'd Dec. 2008.  I plugged it in &amp; tested it with a 4 oz cup of water just to see if it would heat anything (I certainly wasn't putting any food in there before clean up). The only thing wrong with it is that the turntable is missing; I think I can easily find one at a thrift store. I rarely use microwaves anyway (mostly just to quickly heat water for tea/defrost things)

As it happens, and I'd decided not to go out last night either.  Something told me just to check around 5:30 this morning (pickup is around 7am), so I drug myself out w/my bag o' trash at 6. 

When I got there,&amp; lo &amp; behold, it does! 

There's a dryer @ the other on-site dumpster that probably works too

My diving experience over the last month has definitely changed my outlook on what we deem trash in our society. I'm excited to see what else I come across in my casual diving efforts.

**Found any good appliances in your diving/curb surfing efforts lately?**

(Little story and to share what we found),splatterghost,29,4,18,"So my friends and I have been getting into dumpster diving mainly sticking to Gamestop and a US cellular store. This took place at the US cellular store. We had been there for about five minutes when a red GMC truck comes around the corner and slows down when he sees us. The truck drives real slow passing my car and kind of just watching us when he got close to us I waved but the driver didn't wave back as he crept by. He drove maybe 25 feet past us and kind of sat there shortly but we didn't really think much of it and went back to diving.

The dumpster proved to be really good we found an old blackberry

(This may not be 100% accurate but its about how the conversation went)

PO: ""What are you boys up to tonight?""

ME: (In a friendly tone) ""Just dumpster diving

PO: Can I see the Iphone? We have a report of a stolen 4 today?

Me: Sure (I grabbed it out of the back seat handed it to him he looks it over and hands it back since it was only a 3gs.)

PO: ""I know it's easy to do at night but the owner just called in saying he saw some people outback with flash lights acting suspicious."" (The owner was the one in the red GMC truck.)

Me: ""Ah sorry we didn't mean to cause any trouble. We wont come back here again""

PO: "" Oh I know its just the owner called in again (We had been there before but never met a cop) do you boys have ID's on you?""

We gave him our ID's and he called them in. At this point the officer had gone to more of a relaxed mood he knew we weren't gonna cause him any trouble and we weren't doing anything wrong.

PO: Is this your car?

Me:""Yeah I bought it off my grandma a few years ago and upgraded the rims and what not""

PO: ""Yeah its a nice car""

Me: ""Thanks I'm trying to make sure it last me through college""

PO: ""It sure looks like it will""

Call comes back ID's are clean

Po:""Alright you boys are ok to go""

Me:""Thanks""

The officer drove off to the side of the lot and we drove out he didn't follow us. I figured I'd share this story just to show there are some really nice cops out there.

Some tips:

1. Order the book 'Evasion' online (published by Crimethinc). It is super cheap and i consider it the bible of dumpster diving. A million ideas

2. Gear. Bring the right tools for the job. Having a bike with panniers, unless you like a rotting decomposing smell in you backpack of course. Stick can be handy for really grotty dumpsters you'd rather not dive in. Often the best stuff is below a layer of gunk. With the stick you can stay clean and still quickly asses any dumpster.
I like to bring some basic tools: claw hammer

3. I wear a gray, looking decent will often mean the difference between getting a warning and getting a fine or even being hauled off to a police station/getting into a scuffle. Dumpster owners will be much nicer to you too.

Tonight I went diving and noticed that a whole 2 litre bottle of milk was poured over the large amount of fruit and vegetables that were thrown out. I also noticed that a few watermelons had been deliberately smashed so that they would be tainted and couldn't be taken. I know from previous experience of diving in this bin that they do this often
I just wanted to put it out there that the act of purposely tainting salvageable food is pretty high up on the scale of scum-baggery. Do you think that the people who are responsible for this think ""I'm not gaining anything from this food

I’m not new to diving although it’s been a long time since I’ve ventured into the dumpster arena. 

As a teenager I used to go diving with my dad. The best was when we went to the local donut store and we would haul out huge garbage bags full of donuts. When we got home we would stick them in our freezer and when we wanted to eat them we threw them in the oven. Yummy.
Also got every Disney movie possible on vhs back in the day. Tv’s, etc etc…

So after reading through quite a few posts in here I decided to try and hit up an Aldi dumpster. I didn’t plan this trip

The dumpster wasn’t exactly hidden and quite near another very busy business. I wasn’t liking that at all. Makes me feel like someone would confront me and I feel more vulnerable being a woman. 
So anyways I slide the dumpster open and peek in, eww, threw them back. Pick up a box, shit, it’s really heavy. Inside are a bags of oranges and apples. 
I grab both and bolt for my car. Haha

I don’t know why I was so scared

I get home and all of the oranges seem to be just fine. I was only able to save 3 apples out of the huge bunch though.
Overall I’m quite thrilled with my first find. It’s expensive feeding my family and if I can stop by a dumpster once or twice a week and do a quick dive it will save me some bucks. 

Happy diving everyone!

* Enough laundry detergent to probably last me the year. $40
* 4-5 packs of Clorox/Lysol cleaning wipes - $15
* 12-pack of AMP energy drinks. $15
* 12-pack of Oceanspray 16oz. Juice - $8
* 2 Armani Medium Dress Shirts
* 1 polo shirt
* Loose change - $10
* Misc. Womens clothes
* A few rugs I'm going to clean for my new apt. - $20
* A nice army style duffle bag- $?
* 12-pack worth of ok beer - $10
* 2 cell phone chargers
* 1TB Hard Drive - $50
* Lots of clothes that the consignment store didn't take back - went to goodwill. - Priceless 
* Enough dumpster booze to get too drunk while dumpster diving
* **So about $428 total value

I passed up multiple printers and mini-fridges because I just didn't need them. I've overdone it in previous years so this time I really only took what I thought I would really use. I did the diving over probably 4-5 nights over the last month. 2 nights in mid-May when everyone moved out of the residence halls and the last two nights as everyone moved out of the apartments. Some nights I go alone

I could have hit the residence halls a bit harder but I was lazy. Overall a good season. Can't wait until next year.

I just ran out my door to go hunting (just for the hell of it). I'd read online somewhere that this time of the month (the 7th or 8th) is sometimes good because of dispossession &amp; clean-up after move outs.

There are 2 dumpsters in my complex. I made my way over to the first one &amp; saw a mattress (um

The little table was scuffed

I really liked the base of it though: round

I tried lifting the table by hand (since it was a cheap one). 

Though the top was light

I figured I'd circle back

I scoped the other spot &amp; found a great (heavy wood framed) mirror that must've been attached to a dresser @ some point because it had 2 long wooden poles attached. I grabbed it (going to paint the trim for my bedroom) &amp; walked it back home.

Popped inside

Since I live 1 minute away from the 1st dumpster, no sweat. When I got back downstairs &amp; looked toward the dumpster landing, my mouth dropped open.

**NO WAY**

But

Someone must have seen me about to grab it &amp; come down from nearby to snatch it up.

And thus

**Ever had that happen?**

Lesson: ALWAYS carry your gloves...and never blink.

Heh.

So anyway, in order to keep these methods effective through the dumpster owners' ignorance of them.  But I feel okay about posting it here - let's just be mindful of where we all put this info out to.

There's a couple ways to get into a locked dumpster. The easiest, ideally being a solid rod with a cotter pin through the end. The pin is unbent and pulled out, then the hinge rod is slid out from the opposite side until the back of the flap door is free.

Sometimes

Many hinges, on both sides. Note that many have this only on one end, with the other end using a retainer like those above, so be sure to check both ends. In cases with a truly permanent retainer, the hinge cannot be practically removed, and so another technique must be used to liberate the trash.

If the hinge is not feasible to remove, most simply is to use a sturdy lever, such as a ""2x4"" piece of wood at least 2-3 feet long, to pry up the middle of the flap, halfway between the hinge and the lock bar. Many plastic door-flaps are even molded to bend and crease on this point, which aids the process. Once this point is pried about 10 inches or more upward, it's usually possible to pull the front of the flap over the bar on the outer corner, so it will be obvious that someone has opened the dumpster without the key.

Finally, and even opened. Similarly, I've seen some that have a lock on just one of two ""window"" openings, with the other completely movable.

It's also possible to open locked dumpsters destructively, where it goes around the hinge shaft, for its full length. The door can then be pulled or pried off of the shaft and removed. With some time and tools, it can even be pushed back onto the shaft, and it is unlikely that the damage will ever be noticed, while the dumpster can still function normally.

Further types of destructive entry are possible and obvious, using a grinder or pipe-cutter to sever the hinge shaft, etc., but I don't recommend doing this at all, as it alerts the owner of the dumpster that someone has forced entry, and makes them very angry - possibly angry enough to start using a more secure receptacle, or take measures to catch someone in the act of entering the dumpster at a later date and prosecute them.

I have also noticed a laughable security measure recently, which impresses the inner nut into the plastic door, and then turn the eyebolt counter-clockwise to slowly unscrew it from the nut inside held this way.  Because of the cable or chain running through the eye, it is unlikely that you will be able to unscrew the nut in one round.  It may require releasing the pull, pushing the bolt in (to free the nut), then re-turning the bolt clockwise to unwind the cable or chain that has come around it.  After enough reptitions, the nut should drop into the dumpster, allowing the door to slide.  Note that if the nut is ""locked"" in any way

* 3 cordless phones
* a blackberry curve (8300 series)
* a GameCube and Xbox 360 game
* a PS2 guitar hero or rock band (I don't know the difference in accessories) wireless guitar - perfect because I have the game now too (picked up different spots on different days)
* collapseable beach chair with carrying bag
* anti mosquito tent (not a sleeping tent)
* sleeping bag (good because I've misplaced my old one)

*edit2* 

I was going through the electronics I picked up.

PC works, some games are still installed and work (like WOW - Frozen Throne).

PS2 - turns out it's a Slim (goes to show how much I know about this console) also works. 

DVD player - works. 

Headphones - works

I was going through some of the burnt DVDs from the first night's find and saw a disc with the label VCD (movie) but I didn't recognize the name. I popped it in the DVD player to see if it also plays VCDs. Turns out it's an 80s porn. There's definitely more talking than fucking going on. 

This has sure turned out to be a productive week. Hahah. Happy treasure hunting

I was behind some buildings in a downtown parking lot, I did want to see if there was anything good.

Sure enough

So why was this dive significant?  Because it helped me figure out a way to do some subtle diving in broad daylight.  Namely

Not a whole lot of trash, if you get asked why you're there, just say you're throwing away something from Mickey D's or whatever, because you don't want to litter.  And, if someone asks you why you're taking so long, tell them you think you might have thrown away something important...ask them to help you look, then ""find"" it in your car and heave a sigh of relief. ;)

- Gloves
- Headlamp or Flashlight
- Car or wagon
- A computer or a phone capable of making Kijiji listings
- some screwdrivers

**Where to look:**
___
1. Look on your city's website for electronics recycling dropoffs
2. scout the city in a car for electronics stores with unlocked dumpsters
3. Check if your local dump for an electronics recycling dropoff

**How to get started:**
___
What I do is first I go to all 3 of the greenboxes in my town

- Laptops

- Cellphones

- Keyboards (mechanical if you can tell the difference)

- TVs and monitors, and CRT TVs will get you a good $10 per TV anyways

- Really anything that looks cool and you think you might be able to sell

After doing that I go to the store dumpsters, sometimes I find an old lappy or an iPhone

The last thing that you need to do has to be done during the day, dump off your shit, and bring some crappy mouse or something to dump in the pile for the dropoff, and while you are there take anything that looks sellable, the people who work there really don't care, I walked back to my car with a stack of laptops and sold them to the local pawn shop for $500 for all of them

**How to sell large quantities of something**

- if you are caught red handed by the popo
- stores that change locations or remodel might throw out a lot of old stock in the process.
- apply the principle of liners to everything you do.  use cardboard as a barrier between yourself and all unwanted funk.

As for the store possibly locking up the bin, only surfers), and the lid is all messed up (plastic bent out out of shape, the recent heat didn't help straighten it out either hehe). Funny enough, the bin with the strongest protection is the Star Bucks in the next lot over. It's got an 8ft 3-wall brick enclosure with multiple locks on the front metal gate. There's gotta be much better stuff in there if it's locked up real tight like that. It's not breaking and entering if I just enter without breaking, right?

You can get free used coffee grounds from many coffee shops. Starbucks does this for example. You usually just have to call them up in the morning and visit later to pick them up. The grounds are supposed to be used for composting/gardening (side note: they work great for that purpose).

But. The grounds are perfectly fine. Since they're intended for gardening

They may go bad in a few days (they're wet) but, if you care).

I tried this with Starbucks's grounds the other day: I just put the used grounds into my coffee maker (with a new filter) and made coffee. It tasted fine (I'm not exactly a connoisseur).

Since the grounds are used already, I imagine, whatever the cheap non-decaf coffee-of-the-day is.

Think of it this way. If someone comes and eats the food from the dumpster

It's the same story if they try to donate it to a food shelter. Someone can claim they got sick from it and attempt to sue them. Note the word ""claim"". They don't actually have to get sick...all they have to do is claim it which can start a lawsuit process which many companies don't want to fight even if they are guaranteed to win. It still consumes time and money.

I learned this from some buddies in the military. I was speaking to some of the soldiers who were on kitchen detail and asked them what they do with the left-over foods. They *have* to dump it (although they bring as much home with them and bring a lot to families they personally know need it). They don't necessarily taint it

I asked why they don't donate it and they responded with all the reasons listed above. ""Oh

It's the assholes of the world looking for a quick buck who ruin it for everyone else. 

This can be fixed if all food donations were able to be made anonymously or if reciprocity was granted to those who donate large amounts of food...but then you run into the problem of assholes who will purposely taint donated food just to harm those who eat it.

Get rid of furniture with fabric covering. 

Your computer chair? If it has padding

Sofas and love seats? They gotta go

Get an air mattress for your bed and strip all of the fabric off of your box spring.

Remove all of the carpet from the areas where you spend time (around your bed, etc.).

The supporting information relevant to these solutions is as follows.

Bedbugs go through five life stages. During the transition between each stage, they must feed on blood immediately prior to reproducing. As they progress from each stage to the next, they have a longer window of feeding time available. And, as adults, they can postpone their bloodfeast for up to 3 months, if necessary.

The result of this is that they typically live within 6 to 10 feet of their host and/or feeding ground. Thus, where you spend long hours sufficient for them to come out for a snack.)

Music store. For some reason there is all kinds of stuff in this dumpster. I've gotten cat5 cables, furniture sometimes, and other music stuff. Be careful, this dumpster is kind of in the open. Also, the Dollar Tree nearby usually has the sort of stuff you would expect to find at a Dollar Tree.

I live in the Kansas City area, never seen another diver. I constantly find food/drinks and other various items, and while having junk food is nice to a degree, it's simply too much(trying to lose weight as well). I've tried to donate to various groups, but there is an annoying and common policy regarding expired goods, despite me eating/drinking said goods for half a year with no issue. One group has taken goods one time but haven't returned my calls ever since, no idea why, teas, shoes, you name it. 

I'm running out of room, nor can I let them be thrown away in the bins I found them in, so here I am with this dilemma. Is there anyone in the Kansas City area that would wish to take some of these things off my hand? Perhaps a charity, or even a poor college student, or anyone at all? Even better would be people whom I can meet with regularly, once a month perhaps, so that I can continue to salvage without turning my home into warehouse.

1311167741.0,iusbh,Tips from a Swede! ,iFlameLife,1,0,0,"* **Never** bring ID. Nothing good comes from being able to identify yourself. If they wanna bring you in
* *Most* jurists have established that as long as you are not trespassing and that there is *not* a lock on the container
&gt;Subnote: I would still buy a tool to break the lock and take stuff as long as its from a store. Just watch out for cameras and if you break a lock and see the police
* Do it in group. If you do it in group you can always back each other up and its harder for police to do something toward you if you have a lot of eye-witnesses. (Note: harder
* I myself prefer to take from stores. Often these things haven't expired yet and are still in a whole bag. 
* Don't make a mess

this week alone I have picked up a new treadmill worth $ 2500 new, three expensive microwaves, more than a thousand dollars worth of brand new makeup, many costume items, about a ton of high grade steel from bedframes, several entire designer wardrobe collections. lots and lots more. I also have distributed a couple hundred lbs of dry, canned or still frozen food. 
I set up a market stall type thrift shop outside the city and I sell high value items for five or ten dollars and can make a thousand bucks a week at this time of year.
I live in a million dollar house with my wife and seven dogs plus revolving guests. I not only make a living dumpster diving but I also fund my feature film with it and have lots of food and goods for people that need it.
