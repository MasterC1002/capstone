1359402631.0,17g2nz,So what's new?,Menekis,149,8,46,"I came back on reddit for the first time in months today and realized that there were a lot of angry gamer here. I understand why you are angry but I can assure you that there is developpement being done. I know that there is a lot of discussion about the t-shirts and I suppose it is because we talked about it a lot. The reason we talked about it is because we want to get rid of that aspect of the kickstarter. This is a lot of work and kickstarter didn't really helped us out with their shitty form. BUT we don't work on that all day. We do a lot of experimenting. Personally I work a lot on migrating our database on better servers. We already tried Herok/appfog but they didn't worked like we wanted so we are trying another solution. We need something solid for the type of gaming we are aiming for and something that work 3/4 of the time is not good enoug.. you might have seen some issues on the http://sauropodstudio.com. We used the same system for our game.

The radial menu is a big change in the gameplay. It is something that will completly change the way you create/build/etc and it was a big issue in the prototype version of the game. There is  a lot more to tell but I will let Germain talk about it when he's ready.

we finally found a way to patch efficiently the game. We first started with a custom way to do it but it was a complete hell

big changes on the pathfinding systems too. that more François's work so I cannot tell what are the technicals differences but it's working way better at this point. 

Our newcommer Paolo is working on the multiplayer and he's working a lot with me testing new systems. We also work on the new castlestory.net website that will change a lot. 

We have our sound guy working here

But what took us a lot of time too is moving to the studio. You might say that is not for what you backed us but since the whole team was almost living at my appartment I must say it is maybe the most important thing we needed to do. I had to be at my home from 8am to 9pm since not everyone here work on the same hours. Not being able to live a social life for 4 months was a bit hard but I always thouht that it was only for a little time. We aren't even completly settled yet but it's getting together. I personally miss my good internet connection but for everything else is is getting enjoyable. 

So there is a lot of other changes but I think you understand that we don't really talk about paperwork and things like that.

I followed this games development when it was first annouced on YouTube ""first demonstration""


Questions:


1) Will players be able to play the map with the Castle used in the Castle Story trailer &amp; ""Castle Story - Gameplay demostration 2"" ?

**1) The island on from the trailer is actually kind of small once you get used to it. We would like player to be able to play on bigger ones than that. We may



2) In ""Castle Story - Gameplay demostration 2"" Germain is showing a widely open gate into the castle, there can be lifted up so the gate is closed (sorry if it's confusing, Im doing my very best to discribe this) will such gates be added?

**2)We plan on adding fence gates


3) Will players at some point in the development be able to see through the walls in the castle tower (similar in Sims games, halls, etc. to make the life more comfortable for the bricktrons.

**3)We are working on a mechanism to be able to see through walls right now.**



4) Under the fighting mechanism show off

**4)The little orbs are the creatures' vital energy / souls. They will definitely have some important part in the game and so will probable the yellow crystals**


5) Lets say I decide to build a wall, without demolishing it with explosives, and be able to use the blocks again?

**5)You will also have ways to detach blocs without dynamite.**


6) While François is showing the fighting mechanism

**6)For now


7) How will I get the game? I donated $25 and I waited actually very long time to donate

**7)We will distribute the game digitally and you will receive instructions to download it when it's ready. The game might be on steam one day and if it's the case


8) Oh and one more thing: people who donated $15+ will be able to send in there name in the finish game

**8)We will ask people to respect some standards of decency with their name. We will try to figure out a way to find out the ones that doesn't fit our standards.**


Thank you for let community follow the development of this game! It's very nice for people in the community to be ""let in the warm"" if you can say so &amp; it have been very nice to follow the development of Castle Story


You guys problably rechieve thousands of questions


Merci!

1350523409.0,11nxhv,How to play,r42xer,98,7,73,"I am going to make a small tutorial

Part I: Moving the camera

You might notice that camera controls are a bit weird. Well, you can move the camera forward, back, left, right. By holding down space and right mouse, you can rotate the camera. By using this in conjunction with WASD, you can practically look at everything in the map. When used with space, using it *without* space moves the camera up and down. Okay

Part II: Playing.

1. Find a nice place to start a castle. I suggest to the left of the starting point on the prototype island
1. Select your bricktrons by clicking and dragging over them (just like in any other RTS). Move them by right clicking somewhere.
1. Cut down some wood by creating the ""logging"" group at the bottom (you should notice a small axe icon)
1. Now notice the on the right hand side of the screen, but that doesn't seem to work).This creates a logging area, and a little blue icon should pop up. Now select your bricktrons and right click the little blue icon. They should get to work cutting down trees. Some logs may fall off the island. That is OK. If your bricktrons do not pick up the logs, it is because you clicked on a tree, not the blue icon. Select them and right click it. 
1. Use these logs to create stockpiles. Create around 10 stock piles by creating the ""build"" group. Again
1. Now it is time to make a mine. Make a ""mine"" group at the bottom, with enough rubble, a stockpile will turn into stone blocks. Once all your stockpiles are filled, you can begin to make your castle.
1. If you go back to the build group, and start clicking to place phantom blocks. Right click to rotate a block. But wait! Your bricktrons aren't doing anything. Cancel the tool by holding right click and selecting cancel. Now select some bricktrons (not all of them, some should still be mining) and right click any phantom block. They should begin to build. Remember, bricktrons need stairs to go up levels when they are carrying blocks!

Part III: Things to avoid

Don't have a bricktron in a space when another bricktron places a block there. This will glitch it out

Part IV: Tips

You can cancel placing blocks by holding right click and moving the mouse down over ""back"" in the radial menu (works with Win7
You can chop down specific trees by right clicking them with a bricktron selected. You can also increase the size of a logging area by going to the sword tab in the menu in the top left corner (thanks Grygon!)
To delete blocks or blueprints

To obtain new bricktrons, but that, IMO, is cheating :)

I'm sick of all the coddling Sauropod gets.,dino340,93,35,67,"This is basically a response to a line of comments that you likely won't see because I was being an asshole initially and got downvoted pretty much to oblivion. Anyhow I digress....

The coddling towards Sauropod isn't helping anyone, working on an independent game, even using the same engine Sauropod is lightyears behind. Kerbal Space program is an excellent example of this, two years ago there was Kerban, the Mun hadn't been released, basically you could try and orbit around Kerban and that was it, now KSP has a whole solar system with planets all with different physical aspects and Extra Vehicular Activities as well as different types of vehicles and scenarios. I know it's not exactly the same timeframe

I'm just saying that all the posts saying ""You guys are doing fine don't worry about time"" aren't helping, they turn out to be a pretty shitty person, that's how things work in the real world.
Granted kickstarter funding is a new thing, I'm pretty sure if they had tried to get someone to publish their game initially they would have looked at the way they've progressed and said ""Nope, we'd prefer to support a team that's actually going to get things done on time.
It's hard to look across this subreddit and just see a whole bunch of people with their noses so brown from all the ass kissing they do, you can see that in the fact that when I said the next update was going to be a disappointment in the thread saying that everyone would be getting the update regardless of if they were a kickstarter backer or not, is upvoted more than it is downvoted.

I think it's not a secret

In january if you remember we had a period when we couldn't give any news on the blog due to the lack of time and the lack if info we had at that time. This resulted in getting the community pissed at us because they felt ripped off. I clearly understand why now and that's why we decided to change how they way we handle the blog now. We went from very heavy blog post that took almost a day to write and build to a simplier and faster one. 

Now we keep receiving emails and messages that we still lack communication. We aren't a marketing company and we want to work the most on our time on the developement of the game.   But I think good ideas can come from the community sometime that's why I'm asking you. is there something you would really want us to change? if so

It's easy to criticize without giving any options. What I want now is having ideas and options from the public. I'm sure you have tons of ideas that you could share with us.

&gt;  this friday we will start a 7 day countdown for the activation of the kickstarter.

&gt; the trailer will be available only at the end of the countdown.

&gt; it will be a digital distribution only. we will use the Humble Store system

&gt; there won't be discount for the people who registred earlier the reason why is there will already be sort of a reward for the people participating to the kickstarter. 

&gt; we will continue to sell the game after the kickstarter but the prices will probably changes and the goodies that come with it will be removed to give a exclusivity to the ones who kickstarted us.

----
* [bricking bricktrons](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/11uvxi/how_to_brick_your_bricktrons/): interrupting them while holding stuff kills them.
* [creating bricktrons](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/11p6w8/psa_new_bricktrons_can_be_legitimately_obtained/): blue crystals are collected over the course of standard mining

----
* when you have a lumber/mining group selected
* [mine with tunnels](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/11r92e/protip_use_tunnels_instead_of_vertical_mines_they/): these are awesome. click the little tabs at the walls of the tunnel (they turn green) and pull to extend your mine/tunnel
* you can tell stockpiles to accept only wood or stone if you want to keep things tidy. 

----
* right click to rotate pieces
* hold shift
* hit 'delete' key to erase debris. you can also collect it with bricktrons the same as for mining. 
* certain pieces have rules for where they can be placed. still trying to figure this out x.x

----
* [building large wooden floors](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/11pr4e/tutorial_building_large_elevated_floors/): very useful for castle interiors. i like to put catapults on top xD
* [staircases](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/11ol4z/spiral_staircases_for_those_high_up_places/): i have to try encasing this sometime to make it look prettier
* [bridges](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/11pmqg/building_bridges/): building to a higher island is relatively easy
* [catapults](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/11oksw/how_to_fire_catapult_with_pics/): because its not fun to build things unless you can destroy it too =P

[this is as far as i've come so far](http://i.imgur.com/EcC4x.jpg). any input is appreciated! i tried to make a spiral staircase turn to the side

current problems i have:

* in the raised floors
* putting barrels down sinks them into the floor for some reason.

Giving your little Bricktron dudes some character and emotions could go such a long way into making them more fun to interact with. Having them need food, arms flailing in feeble attempts to put himself out. Cute little screams could enhance this effect. Imagine the dudes getting into drunken brawls when consuming beverages from the tavern. One of the dudes could be all alone in the dark, he could be shivering in fear, being slightly paranoid (glancing left and right nervously).

All these emotions and needs allows you as the player to feel a sense of maternal protectiveness that compels you to help them when they are in need (or if you're a devious bastard

Also, archery targets, traps and other neat little things would all add depth to the game.

* Upped ""party"" sizes. 12 is nice

* Better pathing. I like the way the bricktrons will pass items along in a chain if they're in the same group. That's an amazing idea. But

* Another use for wood, when digging mines, the mine shaft auto build support struts periodically. (The mine at a certain depth, when collapse is near should have one of it's bricktrons go grab some wood and toss up a support. I know this can be done manually, but until the camera/x-ray usage is a bit less finicky it'd be useful.

For one to dig out stone and or dirt (they said they were considering giving dirt an option to flatten out terrain). Of course the Moat would not neceserally be filled with water. Would be awesome if it could be done

It would force the enemy to focus on point of attack and you can easely create a bottleneck with a bridge and archers shooting down into said bottleneck

As a person who lives in Europe and has seen a gigantic Moat&amp;Ramparts design made to avoid invaders even if they attempt to get through the moat I know how to create bottlenecks in your castle which make defending easier.

I have had, how it seems like a lot of the time it takes for a bricktron to get from Point A to Point B depends a lot on other bricktrons (what they are planning to do and where they are currently positioned). If too many bricktrons try to build a tower with a simple staircase, we end up with a group of bricktrons staring at each other while we wait for them to pass the brick (if the other bricktron isn't holding something).

If I send hours making an intricate and beautiful castle, and will it have an effect on the strength of our castle?  What about double thickness walls, multiple curtain wall, etc?

1. Build catapult on right side construction menu
2. Have a bricktron pickup a empty barrel by right clicking on barrel with bricktron highlighted.
3. Hold right shift after bricktron is holding barrel then right click on catapult. You may have to click a few times around catapult also the edges seem to work best.
4. After barrel is loaded left click on catapult click top button 
""set target"" drag mouse around to aim left click when red line is where you want it. Now left click again on the catapult you should see your line is where you left it.

Anyways

**Sandbox MP**: Basically a no-goals game with no 'win' objectives. Players can do what they like, with no win conditions. Everything else should also be enabled, NPC and monster raids, disasters and nasty weather, or whatever things you plan on doing with the game to make random events both interesting and 'FUN'.

**Persistent World PvP**:  Have you ever played one of those old school Play By E-Mail games where you set up a queue of commands that takes hours to complete, I'm not saying to make mining and everything take a whole day to do, but I'm just saying that to give you a general idea of where I'm headed. Games like 10Six, or Time of Defiance, you know?  Anyways, how I'd set it up, is that while the game speed progresses at a normal pace, you lose the ability to directly control your troops and they act following generalized commands at your request like typical Dwarf Fortress.  If you attack other players, like they planed out their roles during fire-drills. ""If we become under siege

Or you could just save the game and quit when everyone is done, lol.  ^.^;

**Pure Co-Op**: Double the players with double the randomized event survival trials.

Mainly though, and let conflict develop dynamically. If players want to fight, they can just do that. If they want to work together, they can do that too.  I would like to see as many events as there are ships in A.I. War: Fleet Command.",,False,self,False,t3_xm3o6

But enough about Minecraft

Instead of ignoring the mistakes of past

* An official modding API.  As with almost any game, later on, have a built-in mod manager for increased ease for the player.

* A mulitplayer mode as stable as singleplayer (should they implement it).

* Flawless (or near flawless) implementation of the basic mechanics (castle building, fancy decorations, etc.).

* If the game is to have a story (or story mode)

1. Suggestions should be treated as they are.  I hate nothing more than when an author/ game developer/ creator of culture sells out either under pressure from the fans, I would go out and learn C++ or something.  If I'm playing something made by you, I want all of it to fit.

2. This thread is for very thought out suggestions.  Posts should be about advancing the game mechanics or features in a very specific manner.  Please do not post unless you have a clear idea.  Additionally

With that said,"" I thought of siege weapons.  Having been a few hours now, and after putting much thought into it, I think I have a winning idea.  To construct a siege weapon, you first start out with a pallet similar to the stockpile.  On top of the pallet, you place a blueprint (possible made by a bricktron/research bricktron) that tells your bricktrons to gather materials in a manner similar to the brick making we saw in the first video.  Afterwords, you receive a static weapon.  As of yet, catapult, but I'm sure more could be added if necessarily.  Now then, each weapon would have to be given time to properly assemble it before it could be used

With that, such as having chassis with better protection of bricktrons from ranged attacks and chassis that allow for more than one weapon.  Additionally, I have thought of having a third aspect of a ""Utility Improvement"" that one could attach to a weapon to increase damage, range, rate of fire, necessary operators, movement speed

TL;DR if you need a ""tl;dr"" then find another post,False,self,t5_2tb9e,False,,bricktron,t3_o3yzj

I originally suggested that the ""Story"" part be cut out and changed with something else

Whilst I appreciate that the developers are pouring the very essence of their hearts and souls into making this game a reality, would this occur?

Quite simply, and does not differentiate the game at all, when clearly, something like this should be heralded as a fresh take on games in an age of stale, stagnating, recycled garbage in the gaming industry...not naming any in particular.

Furthermore, or, put simply, trying to gain popularity as a spin-off of similar named games. We all know this can happen a lot easier than originally expected. Remember Final Combat vs TF2? Besides, the last thing you want as an indie developer is a lawsuit on your hands, from ""stealing"" creative license. Yes, I am referencing Notch's legal case with Bethesda

My suggestion for the community that has rapidly accumulated around this great project, but promote a fantastic opportunity to make a wonderful game exceed every expectation of it, and more.

As a starter for discussion, so long as you have your own to back them up.

* Sequester (meaning to insulate/isolate)

* Citadelis (slight corruption of Cidatel

* Haven (safe place)

* Enclave (effectively

 First of all, and drag a Bricktron into the build tab on the bottom marked by a hammer. 
When you've done this
Now you have to get a mine started. Assign 3 bricktrons to the mining tab at the bottom
You are now free to start designing buildings with the build tab.ake sure to manually chop down a tree if you need wood because the ""select area to cut down trees"" function isn't working atm.

My Bricktron and myself know that what counts in this world is not the bricks we lay

My Bricktron is human, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its life. I will ever guard it against the ravages of weather and damage as I will ever guard my legs, my arms

Posted by Sauropod Studio

(this update has also been posted in our blog

I'm making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS!

Ahem

We don't really know where to start. We were preparing for a long, over before it even started. But now that we look back on how we did things, the long grueling campaign was in fact the three months we spent painstakingly creating the trailer, and filling in the paperwork in order to sign up for Amazon Payments. And boy was it worth it!

But it's not over! In fact


[(full sized picture here)](http://www.sauropodstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ThankYou.jpg)

The mood here at Sauropod Studio is incredible. A mix of awe and relief. It's that kind of feeling you get when you work really hard on something, nothing is set in stone, but we're going to announce some of them really soon. 

In the meantime, here's a few things we plan on doing in the near future:

We've contacted an amazing artist to help out with the posters. Germain had originally planned to paint them himself
We would like to hire a professional sound engineer to help us with the ambience of the game. We realize that music is important
We will probably hire Thierry (aka. Menekis) officially as Webmaster and Community Manager. He could also even help with the multiplayer since he has some experience in that. Until now
Lots more coming in the next days! 
We're going to post some polls soon to see what everyone would like us to do next

 It would be a food system that causes you to get more characters.

This is how it would work.
1) A player would order a food source square to be made
2) Once it was ready to be harvested the player would order it to be harvested for one food resource 
3) Once there were enough food resources your population would grow

It could work where each character needs one food resource.  Then once you have a surplus of food you could choose an option to spawn another Bricktron.",self,t5_2tb9e,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/vyq20/i_just_sent_an_email_to_the_devs/

I'm not going to be necessarily nice about this


Ever since the huge success of Minecraft, and I should have been more careful before I got on the bandwagon of /r/gaming post and made contribution.

I have not been checking the daily progress on this game

1. for a moment
2. for a moment
3. most recently

none of above, crowd sourcing, and doesn't really make anything out of it. And, now I kind of see if there is even anything that's pushing the developers to complete the game. Kickstarter due dates are way overdue, and I don't know if there are even any reasons for Sauropod to deliver anything to anyone. ""We will deliver when it's done"" ""coding takes longer than you think it does"" kind of responses doesn't seem to show the enthusiasm of the developers.

Honestly

I feel like I'm standing in the line for roller coaster (just like in roller coaster tycoon) and been given some side attractions like blog/forum updates

I'm not ranting here because I'm feeling like I've wasted money on a indie game development. I'm ranting because I expect more from Sauropod. I remember Fez took FOREVER to come out and Phil Fish had such a hard time getting it done. But Sauropod shouldn't be having difficulties like Fish was having. There are huge amount of funding, Canada.

p.s.: What makes Castle Story worth more than Minecraft?
