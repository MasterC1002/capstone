Some of these might be true. However, I charge /u/The_Horse_Yeller with two charges of felony douchebaggery (for the nationalities) and three charges of misdemeanor douchebaggery (for the professions, which I find less severe).

The 6st charge of douchebaggery is for the broken english /u/The_Horse_Yeller uses when he pretends to be Russian. He does not use this in any other context.

/u/Spaghettimonnster provided verification in the way of a few pictures of someone posing near ""the pile"". In the months following 9/11 there were probably thousands of workers have similar pictures and this is an incredibly weak ""proof"".

In general

We the people of Reddit should not stand for this! People claiming to be 9/11 heroes are the worst kind of people

*OP's father probably has no knowledge of this AMA
*OP is messing with things that should not be messed with.

This is by all means an extreme account of douchebaggery and Public Indecency to such an extent that I believe a new charge should be created: Kimjongun.jpg

/u/REDDIT- was recently banned from /r/lgbt after (quoting /u/REDDIT-)

*EXHIBIT B:*

In the aforementioned private conversation between /u/REDDIT- and /u/robotanna

*EXHIBIT C:*

This sort of immature behavior is disgraceful to our reddit community and reflects poorly on a sense of tolerance and equality that reddit so much deserves.  Hear

My evidence can be found in a [PREVIOUS THREAD](http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/1id7lv/the_conan_social_media_team_are_using_bots_to/) which I created highlighting my suspicions. But from that post came more evidence and users who also support my claim. Check that post for more information.

____________________

* I have been lurking on reddit for over a year now and I have noticed that these Conan joke reposts are FREQUENTLY and CONSISTENTLY hitting the front page capping out over 2100 upvotes per post. This is not a recent occurrence.

* These posts are very quick to amass a bunch of upvotes

* On [THIS POST](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1icfb0/well_definitely_he_is/) it has currently gotten 1900 points. I posted a comment when it was at 1200 points and within 20 minutes it had broken the 2000 mark. The post peaked at 2900 points and then was mass downvoted to 1900.

* [Another Conan Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1i9hnm/conan_explains_the_obvious/) hit the front page on 15th July and has 2037 upvotes with only 160 comments. A large portion of random comments in that thread are massively downvoted for no reason.

so within two days two Conan posts have made the front page with minimal comments.

* [Heres one from 6 days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1i1sjs/conan_is_excellent/) 2772 upvotes but comments are at 700 here. 

Those are just the recent ones.

* A redditor by the name of /u/AltRedditAcc replied to my comment saying  

&gt;""I've seen countless of other submissions reaching frontpage with ~2k upvotes and near no comments
Definitly bought upvotes. There's no way thousand people upvote without commenting and then suddenly everyone stops lurking.
I'm actually surprised noone brings that up ever... until now."" 

* Another reddior /u/junkshez said this.
&gt; I remember messaging one of the mods on /r/funny  in February about a Conan post that reached almost 4000 points.
A lot of these ""fake views"" posts are fairly obvious

* From what I can tell the posts are not being posted by bots but rather regular redditors. This means that the posters are not associated to the PR team and usually have no idea about it. A possible scenario could be that bots scan and find these Conan joke images and give them a shot of upvotes to increase their visibility and have other normal redditors do the rest. These bots probably bugged out which is why you sometimes see mass upvotes or downvotes on random posts/comments.

* /u/romz7 replied telling us what happened regarding his post. 
&gt;I have no idea about the bots voting or anything but yes it was the first time any of my posts got up voted in such a short period of time. I was at about 100 up votes in the first hour and then by two and half hours I was almost on the front page. After that

* Redditor /u/Wylye claims this sort of thing is happening on other sites too. Heres his quote.
&gt;I've seen it happening on other sites as well. Fark.com always seems to have at least active TeamCoco branded link in their video tab per week

________

This evidence may not exactly be airtight but there certainly is some foul play involved here.

Long time lurkers have definitely noticed these weird threads and something must be done about this.

/u/Reemusk and /u/Andrewsmith1986 wanted to set up cases against some of the biggest redditors

&gt;KARMACOURT GAZETTE STAFF

&gt;Earlier today, a ""power user"" solicited his assistance in a nefarious plot: Utilize the public forum of /r/KarmaCourt to defame prominent redditors by skewing public opinion against them.

&gt;As the facts in this story are impossible, and in the interest of providing both timely and factual reporting, we are posting the entire contents of the two messages sent to us by the informant.

&gt;&gt;Hello, as I am wont to do, at the beginning. &gt; &gt;I am a powerful user in /r/KarmaCourt- although you may not recognize my name, you would certainly recognize the things I have done behind the scenes. It is of no matter, as I will divulge neither. &gt; &gt;I was contacted about a week ago by a reddit ""power user""- in fact, the most powerful user of them all. He asked me to help him with the first step of his plan, which utilized Karma Court to change the public opinion of several other power users. Karma Court, was unique in that it often decided the opinions of the entire site

&gt;The following was received less than an hour later.

&gt;&gt;I told you I would not log into this account again, then ReddiquetteCourt will make their move. This will happen over a period of weeks. ReddiquetteCourt is incidental to their - to our - plans- as long as KarmaCourt is disbanded, we do not care about the fate of /r/reddiquettecourt. We are now communicating via email rather than reddit messages. &gt; &gt;The other thing is that I said ""half of karma court are either on our side or sockpuppets"", but that wasn't true. Three accounts are sock puppets, and two moderators are on our side.

&gt;If these allegations hold any shred of truth, remains to be seen.

Bailiff: 

-----

I would first like to thank you for making it this far. What you are about to read may be lengthy, and so something must be done about it. 

So I bring you today my charges against the Moderators of /r/KarmaCourt.

The charge: Article III

&gt; **Obstruction of Justice** - Impeding or obsfucating an investigation, or providing false evidence to the court.

I believe the moderators of /r/KarmaCourt are guilty of Obstruction of Justice in so far as they do not adhere to their position by keeping the court in order nor do they even properly update court information and resources. For example, which is still not all that impressive.

A moderators duty

&gt; J.  Moderator - A Redditor who has the responsibility to keep tabs on a subreddit and keep it in line.  **A moderator in /r/KarmaCourt must be able to judge cases

I would further go on to charge the Justice's with Article III, but on a much larger scale, making it a felony:

&gt; **Time-wasting** - When a Redditor brings a frivolous lawsuit or files frivolous charges. Note

I believe the moderators are guilty of providing a frivolous sub-reddit where a majority of cases remain unsolved for extensive periods of time. They say that we take this sub-reddit too seriously, in their own constitution, one can be charged for bringing frivolous lawsuits or charges. 

Do you know what the definition of frivolous is? Carefree and Not Serious. So they are telling us to only bring serious cases to the court

This is their opinion

----

It is time for change in the KarmaCourt. It is not what it was

I bring my case against each individual Justice in the comment section.

As we have no Justice without Bias in this case

EDIT: Should the outcome be unanimous or should it be majority?


EDIT II: I hereby add the charges of Douchebaggery to /u/thelovepirate for any and all comments he has made in this thread.

&gt; (a). Douchebaggery - A catch-all offence for when the accused is being deceitful or intentionally misleading. **Douchebaggery can be added to any existing charge before the court if the accused obfuscates the process of justice by acting like a dick**. May also be a felony if the douchebaggery is deemed severe enough by the judge.    


EDIT III: Due to the nature of the thread and the fact that it was not a mediation but instead an unorganized argument against me leading to downvotes of comments from a group discussion that was to be me versus the moderators


EDIT IV: A lovely insight from a previous Moderator of this subreddit

&gt; ""disbarred =/= disrobed""

What I see going on is several more moderators being added

EDIT V: I would like to point out [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/16mc3g/meta_i_must_ask_this_to_everyone_of_karmacourt/c7xrvzm) made by a new member of the Moderation team one month ago before being made a moderator.

&gt;We

&gt;The user in question has recently filed a Reddit lawsuit against one of our fearless euphoric leaders with the charges of karma whoring and insider karma trading.

&gt;Not only are these claims false

&gt;We are a peaceful people. We accept users of all creed. We even accepted /u/realhermit. But this wasn't enough for him. 

&gt;In the early hours of the 14th of February, realhermit [posted a thread on circlejerk](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/18iw8r/i_saw_batman_and_nightwing_but_they_wouldnt_sign/) during the great link opening of February. 

&gt;This thread did not represent our community and it

&gt;In what is clearly a case of spite and animosity at the lack of reception of this post on our communities page

&gt;In filling a lawsuit with no basis against a community that has allegedly wronged him

&gt;Though the case was dismissed by the honorable KoreanTerran

&gt;While filing the case against our fearless leader, do not all agree with this charge and are therefor mischaracterized as rebellious to our moderators. Out of courtesy, the countless charges of perjury have been dropped by the prosecution.

Dear members of the court

I thank you for your time and would like to welcome you to this case. I stand before you today as a near defeated man. I was about to give up on the court and my modship alike. One month ago, he has not posted in this sub once. He has tried to make various people mod without consulting anyone else from the mod team on a few separate occasions. I accuse him of trying to get his friends involved as an attempt to one day overthrow our beloved courtroom. His actions lead to some of the lower mods (myself humbly included) having their permissions ""scaled down"" from full permission.

I present:

 [Exhibit A](http://imgur.com/ZrWN9Ef)

and 

[Exhibit B](http://imgur.com/iw6A3g2)


The charge for spamming is from the defendant blowing up modmail on a regular basis with this [.Gif](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view/401923/dancing-lobsters-o.gif) and other various nonesense. He was asked and even warned by /u/KoreanTerran / /u/Fastball360 to stop spamming the Modmail system. His response? He removed his own modmail privleges and left us with this:

*If it pleases the court

As expressed in [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette), and thus the resulting karma, is a currency expressing trust and good content.  Yes, siirka's content was good, but it did not uphold the sanctity of trust.  And what, ladies and gentlemen of the jury is that trust composed of?  Well if I may quote our great moderators directly from [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) it is composed of

A simple search

&gt;[do not] **Post hoaxes.**

Presenting charges against the mods of /r/cringepics for wrongful enforcement of misleading rules.

Charges listed at this time are as the following

* *Grand* Douchebaggery (allowing front page posts that clearly conflict with their rules) [(Charge Confirmed)](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1ke4ro/people_to_reddit_vs_the_mods_of_rcringepics/cbo1gmi)

___________________________________________________________
    Evidence

Rule 2 of /r/cringepics cleary state...

&gt; 2) Do not post images of minors (under 18 years old). We were all young and stupid once. Kids being dumb is not cringe-worthy. This is a bannable offense.

This serious sounding rule makes you feel like it's important by its threat of a ban. Yet the mods can allow posts on their front page that clearly demonstrate that they do allow people to break **some** rules.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/Ro0lk5E.png) is a photo from a deleted post made by /u/xUGRxBoogeyMan. The post was listed as *Removed: No Kids*. In a private message he had told the OP that the kid was 16 in the photo. Clearly this is the work of a lazy moderator that didn't bother to finish reading the post and looked straight to a number. Later the moderator had to say this

&gt; Your post was removed because the person in the photo looked underage.

Lets say (in this case) that the boy was underage. Then while searching through their subreddits front page why was /u/Skreamerz able to find [these **Seal of Approval** posts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1jwmym/the_mods_of_this_subreddit_are_banning_people/) As you can also see this post was removed.

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/15scvt/happy_new_years_from_taco_bell/c7pi0dd


SUMMARY STATEMENT

Clearly this is a paid production for the purposes of marketing.  /u/IxKilledxKenny is either TBGyde or closely associated with TBGyde and therefore acting on behalf of @TacoBell social media marketing. 

Because /u/IxKilledxKenny is just trying to make a living in LA I ask that the court instead pass sentence on the primary offender, and sanction any measures against the Taco Bell brand on reddit, including automation and brigading.  I further argue Taco Bell is a corporation and therefore may be brigaded without violation of Reddit's rules. 

I therefore formally charge Taco Bell and /u/IxKilledxKenny with Class A Corporate douchebaggery.


*EDIT 2:

I petition the court to indite /u/impatrickt to be tried in the same case
1) spamming/self-promotion on behalf of Yum brands
2) conspiracy to commit corporate douchebaggery with Taco Bell / Yum brands

/u/impatrickt is also a real account

http://i.imgur.com/duNok.jpg (publicly shared work by /u/impatrickt from program at local college)

Evidence of /u/impatrickt's active promotion on behalf of Yum Brands:

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/12p760/kid_gets_shutdown_by_kfc_fb/
http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/10ynrp/tacos_people/

Edit 3: /u/impatrickt works for an ad agency Grip Limited, a paid Taco Bell/Yum brands shill.   He has generated millions of page views and brand impressions, sucked bandwidth, and without generating any real revenue for reddit and degenerating the content overall while maximizing the consumption of unhealthy food.  This is a particularly heinous crime when reddit corp is seeking investors who will maximize it's freedom.

Summary:

This further adds support to charges of corporate douchebaggery by Yum Brands (Taco Bell/Pizza Hut/KFC) through conspiracy with young marketing or video production students that have credible reddit profiles.

While the defendant claims to be in law enforcement I contest his claim and that he is lying to take advantage of the current reddit hatred towards the police.  Evidence: 

24 days ago the defendant claimed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1g3k08/whatwho_do_you_still_secretly_obsess_over_even/cagee3y) just 24 days ago that he had not completed college.  I cannot name a law enforcement position that does not require at least a college degree.  I believe the defendant is a) In college to be a police officer or b) Not a police officer at all as further evidence below shows.

Exhibit B) 1 month ago the defendant claimed to be not a police officer but a farm owner in this post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f0ff8/illinois_illegally_seizes_bees_resistant_to/ca5nfo5).  If you scroll down through the comments another user calls the defendant a liar for claiming to be a farmer and he defends himself fiercely.

Exhibit C:[3 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19w2q5/what_resources_are_available_to_discover/c8rtjji) the defendant claimed they worked somewhere (not mentioned most likely due to the nature of the question asked) and was requesting how to find more information about someone at work he disliked.  Although circumstantial I would note that this is not something a rookie police officer would do in what could only be his first month at work.

Exhibit D: Again circumstantial but the defendants comment history includes many anti government comments including [I treat feds like mushrooms. I feed em shit and keep them in the dark](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1g4bcl/whats_your_alltime_favorite_movie_quote/cagod5z).

Submissions: [The Title](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/18q51r/im_getting_desperate_ive_tried_12_different/) in Question

I would like to submit the evidence to the court showing that the [posting history](http://www.reddit.com/user/puntini) does not only show that the poster has not posted in ""twelve different sub-reedits"" but has indeed **not** even attempted to post in **ONE** additional.

The decision to submit FELONY charges was partially influenced on ancillary evidence showing the poster to be a compulsive liar.  Such instances noted by other redditors include:

[–]Sqin 25 points 5 hours ago
No you're not, yet about three submissions earlier you posted a photo of yourself and you are neither of those five people.

And also:

[–]hashbrownies 4 points 3 hours ago
Another bit of bs out of him.
[–]puntini[S] -29 points 2 months ago Middleschooler? I am in college visiting my mom for the holidays and I recently went to a sports store and saw a rifle I wanted and I had to run it by my mom (because I'm good like that) before I bought the gun.
So 2 months ago he's in college and now he's a home schooled and in high school. YUP.

**EDIT**
The ruling has been passed down:

**[–]cameronbates1 4 points 7 hours ago
My decision is made. Puntini is sentenced to 6 months of redditing on hard mode. This means he has to down vote every post he makes for the next 6 months. Puntini is also required to browse r/cringe and watch/look at everything completly for 6 months. Case closed

Addendum C2: http://imgur.com/dQ9YsYd
While TruTrainer has 68 twitter followers

Therefore it is impossible for /u/liontamerNYC to have saw this post on ""TruTrainer's"" social media

This blatant double-creation of accounts alone is enough to CHARGE the MODS OF /R/STARTUPS with 1. INABILITY TO FILTER SPAM and 2. INCOMPETENT MODERATION. However the rabbit hole spirals deeper.

UPON further inspection

/u/whenyourreadyc was created 1 day ago, and be the anti-hero to /u/liontamerNYC

Thus I also charge TRUTRAINER APP with GROSS NEGLIGENCE with regards to GUERILLA MARKETING




Ladies and gentlemen of the comments, to get in an argument within the post and misdirect the public of /r/startups.  Thus, the MODS of /R/STARTUPS FAILED IN THEIR DUTY TO PROPERLY FILTER THE FRONT PAGE OF SPAM.

**Charges:** Bullshit and karmawhoring

1.. Accused by possible real world friend:

&gt; ""[I don't know how to prove it unless OP decides to reply to me

Note: This is accusation is followed up when the accuser posts an original picture featuring a mutual friend on facebook

2.. Post history unlike that of what one would expect of a school teacher.

&gt; Not to mention that his entire post history is about TF2, and arguing about Legend of Zelda with his friends. I highly doubt he is an elementary school teacher.

3.. An arguably too advanced vocabulary and ability for an 11/12 year old.

Judging by his numerous posts it is easy to tell that Jimmy sure does have multiple odd occupations ranging from being a barista to being part of a defense force.You also see that Jimmy really likes to smoke weed and beg for karma on /r/trees by commenting on users posts saying things like ""uptoke"" or ""happy toking friENT"".

From the two times Jimmy has posted a picture of himself you see that they don't look alike! How odd is that? And how is it that jimmy gets all this amazing weed at the age of 18 when he should be busy in the defense force

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury these posts are simply too random to be labeled as true and /u/-jimmyjack- is a liar and a karmawhore.

----

**The case against /u/Meesher**

*Charges being tried for:*

* False Advertisement - Felony - Defined as: When the accused posts a link with an intentionally misleading title.

*Background:*

/u/Meesher claims in his post title that the LICKETYPOP toy found was found in a [Toys 'R Us in Singapore](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/17t2d7/this_was_in_toysrus/c88wi52).

This is flat out wrong.

*Evidence:*

1. Toys 'R Us Labels look like this  - [[Photo Proof]](http://www.worldsgreatesttoys.com/wgtBlog/category/blog-series/price-stickers/toys-r-us/)

2. The labels in the post say 'KIITOS' and look nothing like the Toys 'R Us label. - [[Photo Proof]](http://i.imgur.com/AlRnqD5.png)

3. 'KIITOS' is a store in a Singapore mall that has lifestyle gifts and home accesories - [[Website Proof 1]](http://kiitoslifestyleshop.blogspot.com/) - [[Website Proof 2]](http://www.marinasquare.com.sg/directory/tenant/kiitos) - [[Website Proof 3]](https://www.facebook.com/kiitos.sg)

4. The company that makes the LICKETYPOPS is Fred

5. Fred does not list on their website that Toys 'R Us is a retailer anywhere

6. Toys 'R Us Singapore website does not list Fred as a brand (click the dropdown brand list)

7. On the official KIITOS blog they list Fred products as avaliable - [[Website Proof]](http://kiitoslifestyleshop.blogspot.com/search?updated-min=2013-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&amp;updated-max=2014-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&amp;max-results=1)

9. Toys 'R US Singapore's website allows for searching their product index by a products SKN (Stock Keeping Number). To prove this you can just search for an SKN for example 124192 which [yields this search](http://www.toysrus.com.sg/toysrus/specialoffer/jsp/newSGListProduct.jsp?action=KeywordSearch&amp;lang=en&amp;keyword=124192) (You can see the search keyword in the URL). The SKN in the original post by /u/Meesher is [A023](http://i.imgur.com/LYqSuCf.jpg). So, [but it does not list them](http://www.toysrus.com.sg/toysrus/specialoffer/jsp/newSGListProduct.jsp?keyword=A023&amp;action=KeywordSearch&amp;lang=en).

10. I messaged the official Facebook page for Toys R Us Singapore

*Summary:*

The LICKETYPOPS were at the KIITOS store in Singapore

----

**The case against /u/Kraazyy**

*Charges being tried for:*

* Time-Wasting - Misdemeanor - When a Redditor brings a frivolous lawsuit or files frivolous charges.

* Defamation

*Background:*

/u/Kraazyy prosecuted me for making a frivolous case with a weak backing thus wanting to charge me for time-wasting. He also accused me of enabling public defamation of /u/Meesher when it is undeserved. However my case is not frivilous

/u/Kraazyy should also be tried on charges of defamation of the first degree. Two of the sentances listed in the constitution are denouncement through comment

*Evidence:*

1. /u/Kraazyy's original post - [[Permalink Comment]](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/17utya/umeesher_v_ukode47/)

2. /u/Kraazyy calling a downvote brigade against me as punishment

3. /u/Kraazyy sending me a PM and further public defamation and denouncement - [[Permalink Comment]](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/17utya/umeesher_v_ukode47/c897s97)

*Summary:*

/u/Kraazyy made a frivolous case that wastes time and tainted my reputation much like he claims I did for /u/Meesher.

/u/Kraazyy sent me a PM and publicly denounced me.

----

**Punishments:**

I do not know what punishments are necessary

Essentially I just want people to recognize /u/Meesher lied and I did nothing wrong.

Thank you

**Edits:**

1. I have added more evidence against /u/Meesher and fixed the links to make them easier to read.

Yesterday, he re-submitted the post with the same title, to /r/gifs (http://i.imgur.com/30WCkNo.gif). 

In both of these threads you can find a fair amount of drama, most people brushed it aside saying, ""Well, I've never seen it before..."" as so forth. So far, at this point. OP has yet to do anything *too* terribly wrong.

This brings me to

Most of the serious drama takes place in this thread.

Well... that's all I have for now. This guy seems to be potentially very dangerous. He seems like the kind of guy who may continue to repost things for now good reason

Ladies and gentlemen of the court, my time, on April the 22nd (The Day The Karma Died) a blind and hysterical hissy-fit attack was perpetrated on the person of the redditor known as /u/SatanMD. The accusations did fly, the names did get called, the asshattery nearly collapsed under it´s own gravitational field. That group did attack, aggressively, that user, or plausible
  
AND SO I now request justice be served. Mouse-toting possies short-circuit society in their fathful ignorance and consequence-free violence, and this particular collection of misfits not only show no remorse, no recognition of the outcome of their actions, no recognition of the wrong they did wraught, but they did continue to downvote throughout the trial, and one juror tried to pretend not to see the proof.  
  
Frankly they all suck the puss off of a dead dingos bollocks.  
  
They had better clean their nails and let their mummies wipe the corners of their mouths with spit-shine
  
This one will need a judge

The verdict was simple
  
#### CONSEQUENCES ####  
  
- to the victim, report abuse with resultant posting restrictions because the gutless attack brigade did click the spam button until it's udders did squeak, and a tarnished reputation that some still blind spotty shitheads with their fingers in their ears and there eyes shut still seem hell-bent on ruining, despite the facts and judgement presented in court. Let it be known the victim of these crimes is a pretty cool customer. Others would have spoken to admins about this.

**/u/TheIllogicalSandwich as Prosecutor (/u/diggi91 not present)**

**/u/Conqueror as Judge**

I represent the good people of Reddit when accusing /u/Duhoo of multiple counts of reposting and simple douchebaggery.

In the month of April and may /r/Funny was suddenly flooded by posts of old simpson jokes. Multiple of these posts turned out to come from /u/Duhoo.

After some backround checking and research more posts were discovered being stolen and reposted.

Most of these examples were of jokes from cartoon TV-shows such as The Simpsons

/u/Duhoo scavange the seperate subreddits for this type of content and simply repost it in /r/funny for some easy gained but not earned karma. Latest Example is a post from /r/Futurama:

**Original:**

http://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/1f3d3f/why_i_love_futurama/

**/u/Duhoo's repost:**

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1f4u9h/tell_her_she_looks_thin/

**An example of a post stolen from /r/TheSimpsons:**

http://www.reddit.com/r/simpsonsdidit/comments/1by09r/the_hangover_nah_the_simpsons_did_that_too/

**/u/Duhoo's repost**:

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1eowy8/hangover_simpsons_did_it/

Simply running his posting history through karmadecay shows that he saves jokes from TV-shows that other people post and reposts them a few months or even days later with a similar or the same title. He's been greedy recently and repost things that aren't even a day old.

Examples:

http://karmadecay.com/r/funny/comments/1ednsx/this_is_rare/

This list consists only of posts by /u/Duhoo that are less than a month old. The accused however has been a reposter for much longer than that.

I wish for a punishment to be carried out if the court agrees and the jury deems it fit.

1369268794.0,1eve1s,/u/BTAA4TD v /U/Thisismypornacccct for breach of contract.,,91,13,44,"It started simple enough. The Bingo board for the Xbox One reveal didn't have 4k support. It's obvious that a system that's in market for the next 6-8 years should support TV's that will start shipping this year. So [I simply commented](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1eq6o4/bingo_boards_for_the_xbox_reveal_tomorrow/ca2ut0v) ""Needs 4k support"". It got downvoted lightly. Fine. Someone commented it won't happen. I thought I'd put my money where my mouth is and asked if they wanted to bet Reddit Gold on it. 

 Then [the defendant laughed and challenged](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1eq6o4/bingo_boards_for_the_xbox_reveal_tomorrow/ca2y9nm) ""I'll bet you a year's worth. Happily.""

After the launch event, I said ""support"", but it does support 4k games. He tacitly admits it supports 4k, but then says ""I sincerely doubt there'll be anything that achieves 4k."" 

He claims the Xbox One doesn't even have the specs to run BF3 at 4k. Here's an article with [BF3 running in 4k on available common hardware today.](http://www.brightsideofnews.com/news/2012/6/18/the-4k-graphics-card-shootout.aspx) Not even next-gen [""rocket science level""](http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/new-kinect-is-rocket-science-level-stuff-says-microsoft-1151803) hardware built specifically for 4k gaming. 

Now the defendant is trying to claim his definition of ""support"" is different from everyone else's definition of the word.

I have seen many cases where the prosecution

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/16llka/a_call_for_decorum/) brought it up to me and I agree with everything that is being said in that post. 

It is in my opinion that Judges should be the mods of this subreddit or at least approved by the mods to be a judge in the KarmaCourt. There are many people that come into a case and say they will judge this case then are rash to apply a ruling before each side has rested its case.  A Judge should be acting on the will of the jurors (If Present).

Judges also need to be a little bit more controlling of the case. I have noticed many times the prosecution/defense will be actually attacking one another and shying away from the case entirely.

Saying that

Prosecution/Defense lawyers must be acknowledged by the defendant/plaintiff as their representation then acknowledged by the judge. So many times

And to the observers. What happened to the ""Innocent until proven guilty"" that is the backbone to any court system. I would say 90% of the cases on here the accused is guilty before the defendant/defense has pointed out their case. This included the judges and jury.

I'm not asking for an amendment of the constitution because this is *not really* constitution stuff. It would be more

Now why is this not true you might ask?  
Allow me to bring in my proof!  

**Proof #1:** His proof was not good enough and could have been taken from the internet or could have been a picture of a random man standing in the debris! Also the 2 men look nothing alike!

LINK(S):  http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kzu5/i_am_a_first_responder_to_911_14_years_as_a/c8p0e4f  
**Proof #3** Some guys went through his post history and found [this on another AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/137ypz/i_am_a_police_officer_ask_my_anything/c71rckf) clearly stating that OP's dad was working with Port Authority during 9/11 (please note that this is not SWAT but Port Authority!)   
**Proof #4** The final proof! [Here OP states that it is his dad answering on his account.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kzu5/i_am_a_first_responder_to_911_14_years_as_a/c8p5sb8) But wait! What was that? Wasn't his dad in Port Authority? And then suddenly he is a cop? SWAT even?  
This was the final answer he made. Was he afraid of us finding out what was going on? Perhaps... All i know is that i want this guy brought to justice!

This was my final proof honored people of /r/KarmaCourt!  
I would say that should be enough.  
Since this is my first time in court i hope i am doing this right.  

Thank you!  

Edit: Okay. Looked through the AMA again. It states that ""his dad"" was a cop for 14 years and SWAT member for 8. Since 2001 where he was in Port Authority...

So please, think of yourself as of the law, with the sole intention of carrying it out as best you can. Think before you vote. I am not saying there should be no downvotes.

**Case overview:**

In an AMA for a band member ('Slug') from the group 'Atmosphere',600 comment karma (as of this writing) and has received reddit gold.

Slug responds

Now /u/scuttsy responds, but his comments in the thread are still viewable. [I have archived it here, in case he deletes his comments](http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/210/240).

However, as maybe socialanxietyyy's skin tone is lighter, so I request that an analysis is done of the available video evidence.

If an independent forensics team would like to provide enhanced images taken from the video and put them in the comments below

I believe the fact that socialanxietyyy deleted his AskReddit post is strongly indicative of lying of some sort.

Now

1) socialanxietyyy lied in [the AskReddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13izrz/i_am_a_africanamerican_male_who_does_not_fit_into/) by saying he was black

2) socialanxietyyy was aware of the stage dive incident and thought he could take credit for it, or acknowledgement from the band member. He is black, though, and did not lie about that.

3) socialanxietyyy has lied in both instances.

If it turns out #2 or #3 is the case, and since the AskReddit post falls outside of the 21 day window, then we cannot prosecute that lie.

The [new Karma Court constitution](http://piratepad.net/ep/pad/view/ro.Nxo9wz9P0$gW3KM94F/latest) does not have an appropriate charge for this scenario, there are still adjustments to be made. But for now, I am prosecuting socialanxietyyy under deceit felony charges.

original:

I find it highly unlikely someone would take a screenshot of a video then send said screenshot to a friend instead of just posting the video online and reaping a giant financial reward and international attention.

If there was a video to go with this it would be one of the biggest of the last 365 days. This reminds of the countless bs nighttime hunting images of cougars and bears hiding in the bush unbeknown to the hunter

The case against this:

* There have been countless photos of unsuspecting humans in danger of a predator

* This is supposedly from a goPro. It would take more work to send a screenshot to friend than just upload to youtube

* If there was a video it would be worth 10's of thousands in ad revenue. 

* It still will probably gain international attention as a photo

* would let a friend post it

**The case and charges**

It was on Wednesday, /r/pics and /r/funny respectively. Unfortunately, this falls under the Fair Reposting clause in Article II. Declaration of Rights § B. thus rendering charges such as Repost.png inapplicable. I ask of you, honorable members of the court, to convict /u/poopy_wizard132 of Douchbaggery and False Advertisement due to the title of ""I think my friend's cat actually wants to kill him..."" This title is most likely misleading because the same picture has been posted twice before by different users over a year ago. It would be highly unlikely the cat in the picture is actually his friend's cat.

**The evidence**

As I saw this picture, linking to a search for this picture on [Karma Decay.](http://karmadecay.com/i.imgur.com/2k8chxo.jpg) Here are the links to the threads posted of this picture first: 

[Exhibit A](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/pa5nb/soon/) 

[Exhibit B](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/oozg9/cat_of_disapproval/) 

As you can see, most likely in hopes of this repost not being picked up by repost detectors such as www.karmadecay.com.

It is possible, and he or his friend had posted this elsewhere on the Internet. Then this picture was reposted twice, a year ago, before its original owner posted it to www.reddit.com. In any case, [as pointed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/18g5wk/i_think_my_friends_cat_actually_wants_to_kill_him/c8eofrw) by /u/6675636b796f75 in response to /u/nullghost's comment on the thread in /r/pics, it would seem as though /u/poopy_wizard132 deleted many of his other posts. This could point to him reposting for sweet, sweet karma

**EDIT**

/u/Rizzpooch has come forth with some very interesting evidence indeed! It would appear /u/poopy_wizard132 has already been tried and was found guilty, not deleting them as prior. Continued offense will be met by severe fine of up to 2000 karma per offense."" I am as of now unaware if this fine has been met, as he has obviously continued to do this horrendous act. This would now also officially add to his offenses Obstruction of Justice, as he is deleting evidence. Unfortunately, there is no felony for not serving punishments-- perhaps a law might be added to the Constitution? 

**EDIT II**

I have added a list of court members below to keep things organized. A message was sent to /u/poopy_wizard132 regarding this post

**EDIT III**

The list of court members has been updated. If I missed you

I have made an [album](http://imgur.com/a/uXGUW) of /u/poopy_wizard132's posts and the Karma Decay report

/u/poopy_wizard has actually responded to this post- whilst he is still a lying sneak

**In summary**

/u/poopy_wizard132 is charged with one count of Douchebaggery, both around a year ago. I will leave requested punishment to the other members of the court. He has also been deleting evidence of reposts for quite some time now. Thank you for your time.

**EDIT IV**

It appears the case has been closed!

Jury member and apparently foreman /u/YourPostsAreBad has pleaded guilty. Judge /u/Thiswhatyawanted has [sentenced](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/18gy0i/the_people_of_reddit_vs_upoopy_wizard132_for_one/c8gdq56) /u/poopy_wizard132 to a downvote brigade on posts made up to this moment.

[As previously discussed](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/13dcch/motion_to_define_fit_punishments/), what is to be considered fair punishment. However, I feel the court has not adequately established what is to be considered proper due process. I propose the following model.

* First
* Second, the next upvoted judge shall be considered the presiding judge.
* Third
* Fourth
* Fifth, redditors need to take the court seriously). Questions are to follow linearly, as with a real world questioning.
* Sixth
* Seventh, so i will not restate them
* Eighth
* Ninth
* Tenth, being careful and considerate while weighing the evidence. *In this step it is proper for the judge to remind the people of the court why we are here (aka what charges have been brought forth), and to decide if the accused are guilty of these charges*
* Eleventh, positive upvotes being guilty, negative upvotes being innocent). Ties are to be decided by the judge in reply format
* Twelfth

Notes: All objections are to be made known by immediate reply to the objectionable post. 

Objections must occur before any other posts on the case are made.

 In the event of a judge being shown unfit for duties

Mods are to be considered higher court judges and as such can overturn any verdict

Witness testimony delivered after sentencing can be reason for appeal or reopening of the case only if the presiding judge deems it worthy. 

*At all points during the trial it is the duty of the judge to keep the trail semi-on task

*If a judge is unable to reach a verdict

First

I've taken a hands off approach to the rules around here, so rock on guys.

But... There have been a few disagreements

---

There are no officially sanctioned KarmaCourt spinoff subreddits, it kicks ass. As far as  the other subreddits are concerned, none of them have any real affiliation with KarmaCourt.

---

Which leads me to the KarmaCourt Konstitution

[Keira Knightley palate cleanser.](http://i.imgur.com/Cno4C.gif)

---

And this one seems to have caused a lot of confusion lately. There is no official process for choosing a prosecutor, or any other office. If you want to defend the accused, that's great, but don't be a dick to anyone else who tries to step in and help. 

As of right now

**BUT I WAS DECEIVED!** When I went to check out the comments

The top comment

It is obvious to me that /u/monkeydragon12 has acquired the image previously on reddit and spread a web of lies and a mist of deceit over it to gain sweet, but this I cannot abide! 

***

The charges are thus:

**ONE CHARGE OF SACRILEGE** For disgracing our lord Nic Cage by blemishing a rare picture of his presence with fake images.

**ONE CHARGE OF SHOPPED.JPG** For intentionally photoshopping an image to alter events and gain karma through *lies*.

**ONE CHARGE OF KARMAWHORING** For pandering to reddits infatuation with Nic Cage and lying to gain karma.

There may be charges I have overlooked

The charges?

*Shitty crossposting*

As you can see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/10p5j7/this_man_has_caught_hundreds_of_major_league/), I, the plaintiff and avid sports fan, posted a highlight reel of YouTuber Bobby Crosby's home run catches. The post in question skyrocketed.

However, quite frankly, the most shitty way possible. Paying no reference to the previous post, and not even acknowledging that it was a cross-post, it made it to the front page of /r/baseball.

Here is where shit gets real. In the video, as if it was his nickname. Why in the fuck would he should ""Dodger Phil"" is beyond me.

It is clear that the intentions of Prule84 was to improperly crosspost my post to /r/videos. [The post was made around the same time my post skyrocketed.](http://karmawhores.net/user/Jonny_Watts) Furthermore

The case
---

On behalf of /r/leagueoflegends

People of Reddit, as he said, for ""$150/£100"", by streaming his games playing League of Legends. If he does not reach the goal, he would pay it from ""his own pocket"", he said.

Explanation: streamers

Fifteen (in numbers: 15) days prior to that he made a [similar post with the same title](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1hc57l/keep_me_alive_charity_stream/) (""Keep me alive!"") in /r/minecraft.


Earlier he posted, [LoLStreams](http://www.reddit.com/r/LOLStreams/comments/1hc5ca/keep_me_alive_charity_stream/), [Minecraft (1st post)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1hc57l/keep_me_alive_charity_stream/), [Leagueoflegends (1st post)](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1hc3nf/keep_me_alive_charity_stream/).

---
Accusations
---

I hereby request to condemn the user DryNinja for the following charges:

* Fraud: 

1) asking people to watch his stream pretending to be ill in order to collect money

2) avoiding the /r/leagueoflegends posting rules which disallow ""Streams


* Zimmermanism: abusing his ""illness"" in self-defense
* Perez Hiltoning in combination with Attention Whoring: trying to get attention by pretending to be ill and arouse pity

in six cases.


--- 
Reasons
---

1) The first post in the Minecraft subreddit

2) The defendant

3) His ""evidences"" cannot serve as real proof: [Exhibit B](http://i.imgur.com/SXe7Xez.jpg)

4) Because of the newest /r/leagueoflegends posting rules the defendant had to create an event in order to prevent his post being removed by the mods. Raising $150 (in letters: one hundred fifty) seems odd. Usually, at least $1000-$2000 (in letters: one thousand up to two thousand), popular streamers up to $20,000 (in letters: twenty thousand). In addition, $150 (in letters: one hundred fifty) rather looks like some pocket money and not something that justifies an ""event"".


5) ""I tried my best to convince you all this is not a scam"". What


6) It is strange that the defendant posted this twice. Did his first try in /r/Minecraft not generate enough income or is he just trying to make his stream popular?


---
Petition
---

I request an expert to analyse Exhibit A and Exhibit D. The question I ask myself and Reddit serving Justice should ask is: 


1) Can you drink that much alcohol if you have this specific illness?


2) Does this specific illness cause this skin erubescences?

[A summary so far explained for those who want the quick and dirty.](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1j0c73/uqueenvagina_vs_reddit_for_charges_of/cbadh7a)

I previously was the Prosecutor for 13KCC-07-1i82c9. This case was closed with /u/MyAnDe being found guilty for the charge of grandtheft.jpg

At the start of the above mentioned case I attempted to make contact with the OP of a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/156ott/my_dad_passed_away_from_cancer_spread_from_his/) that came into question as fake, a karmawhore, and consequentially was downvoted into oblivion.

The purpose of this case will be  to have my client exonerated in the eyes of Reddit.

Evidence:

[Exhibit A](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/156ott/my_dad_passed_away_from_cancer_spread_from_his/) - My client's original thread with her story. Just looking through this it can be seen that my client suffered abuse and insults that were more than unecessary.

[Exhibit B](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/157zd7/userqueenvagina_two_people_have_outed_this_user/) - A case in these courts that was brought up against my client that ultimately ended in stalemate. There was no official verdict but the damage done to my client is irreparable until justice is found.

[Exhibit C](http://imgur.com/MmwERtL) - My client sending me a picture with again her OP after finding out that /u/MyAnDe stole her content and re-posted it for their gain.

[Exhibit D](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1j0c73/uqueenvagina_vs_reddit_for_charges_of/cbabl59) - ~~Pending until I speak to my client due to the sensitive nature of this evidence. If this is submitted to the courts there will be NSA redacts to not only protect my client but to also avoid any possibility of dox.~~ Submitted to the Honorable Justice VaporMaverick due to constitutional privacy rights.

1. Is this subreddit going to be serious or not? I know that most of the mods want it to be like /r/circlejerk, we'll just move to another subreddit or maybe they'll do what their users want.

The People charge /u/Weeeens for multiple accounts of sneaky/passive Grandtheft.jpg, and Karma Pimping in the 1^st degree.

/u/Weeeens has habitually reposted content from 1~4 months ago. 90% of his submissions are repost with a slightly different title then the original. Keep in mind that many examples can be used but for simplicity only one example will be used in this case for the time being. The defendant posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hv210/youre_gonna_need_a_louder_shout/) to /r/Gaming which is literally [posted 4 months prior on the same sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1925rb/gonna_need_a_bigger_sword/). /u/Weeeens reposted this other redditers OC without giving any credit and claimed it as his own. Keep in mind he has done this many times on many different subs.

We will now assume that the average prescription would be one a day, far less than the twelve thousand the user alleges she made. Likewise at 10 dollars a pill it would end out being 1800. 

So what we have here is 180 adderall pills OUT of high school. We will assume that she went to college immediately after High school, she has 4000 dollars. The high end 8000. Both substantially less than the poster has said.

Once they encounter these defences, instead of willing to learn about the system, ^((which tells us that when you cast a vote from a profile, an up-vote and down-vote is added to the users, to prevent drive-by brigading)^) they immediately attack my clients and claim that they have bot accounts running to up-vote them!

1. The title of the post refers to the setting as a bus. In [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k913n/bus_ride_in_chicago_this_morning/cbmkhzy)

[**I don't even know What is going on here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1irt06/people_of_reddit_vs_ummofan_for_one_count_of/)- The plaintiff claims the evidence speaks for itself.

[**No Charges in the Post Proper**](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1iry6g/the_people_of_rgaming_vs_kin_no_megami_for_karma/)- OP is e-hurt that someone wants Karma.

 Evidence- If you have a close look at the comic posted, there are no rage faces in the comic. Rage comics HAVE to have atleast one rage face. Therefore, Mr.Sada's post cannot be considered as a rage- comic.

Exhibit B: A comment by /u/joereimer :
&gt;I'm calling BS. I'm a professional painter and this looks suspicious to me. There are a few alarm bells going off. First, the photos he took show very little texture. In fact, it looks exactly like a print that's been varnished to look like it has some texture, but it would have way more texture if it was a real painting. I also make canvas prints, so I know the difference. Why would he take photos with such a shallow depth of field... unless to hide the face that there isn't any texture? He said it's difficult to take photos of paintings for the internet, but I could easily take a photo of any of my paintings to prove it's a painting. I mean, I could be wrong, I'm about 99% sure he just took one of his photos

____________________________________________________________________

Edit:  New facts have come to light.  Most of the deletions have been reversed and a reply from one of the mods states it was a 'mistake'.  I maintain my suit, as later comments were able to replicate my arguments.  I would also like to foreclose an affirmative defense that the defendants may make.  This was not likely the result of the decision of a robot.  Not only were most of these comments deleted long after they were made (though not much longer after my sassy comment to DR666, which remains deleted), but a few random comments remained after this purge, suggesting the work of an errant human, not a precise, cold and calculating robot.  I request we press on.

Just a quick glance at the front page shows that there are defendants being charged with [First Degree Picture-Stealing Faggotry (Grand Theft .jpg).](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/15b8ro/the_people_vs_usersackett66/), [OP [being] the mother ship of all faggotry and [being] the cancer of Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/151gln/this_may_be_old_but_this_needs_to_be_brought_to/), and a multitude of others.

In this subreddit's [esteemed and excellently prepared law review](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/14wyfk/karmacourt_law_review_2012_4th_quarter/)

**The most common accusation charged against users is some sort of ""Faggotry"". It is my humble recommendation that all charges placed on this site shall be considered some form of ""Faggotry"". A defendant should only be charged of some sort of ""Faggotry"" if they have taken to the comments section, more than one comment general faggotry, and either five or more comments, or taking the repost and its defense to multiple subs should be considered gross faggotry.**

**When it comes to picture reposting, none of which are exclusive of the other.**

* Karma Theft
* Karma Conspiracy
* Blatant Reposting

Quoting myself from a [previous case](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/153rha/i_bring_before_the_court_an_abhorrent_case_of/):

&gt;The charge of Karma Conspiracy rests upon the accusation that a user looked at other posts, or with the same name, for the sole purpose of gaining karma.

&gt;It runs slightly differently from Blatant Reposting in that Blatant Reposting is considered so in that it is shameless

&gt;Karma Theft is different from the other two in a few ways. It is also the hardest to defend against. Karma Theft can be done accidentally, finding the appropriate picture, etc. Note that my referring to most things done on the internet as work is done with tongue in cheek.

A [recent, as a further distinction of Karma Theft, with pettyrepost.jpg (note the lower case, and one word), reposts that gained between 500-999 karma should be charged with a simple repost.jpg, and reposts that gained 1000+ karma should be charged GrandTheft.jpg.

Note that these karma counts should be based upon *net karma*

The three types of repost, and Karma Theft may have ""Grand"" placed in front of them if there are multiple instances of reposting being brought into the court at once.

I would also like to note the clear lack of distinction between karma criminal court and karma civil court. While this suggestion is not as important in my eyes as the others, only certain sentences should be entered. A civil case does not necessarily have to benefit the public at all, and should just involve the potentially losing defendant going into the plaintiff's post history and upvoting everything for a defined number of pages, in an effort to return some karma.

More cases should be tried as Reddit, ie spacedicks browsing, new browsing, or other sentences that the court sees fit, actually make sense for us as a community to enforce.

There have been multiple efforts by individual users to institute a ""downvote brigade"" as a sentence of the court. I am of the opinion that this is not a good thing for us to do as a sub. Aside from the fact that becoming a downvote brigade is a really easy way for our esteemed court to get into a lot of trouble with the website

&gt;Mass downvote someone else's posts. If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person)

THE CHARGES

1.    Blatantly Ripping off a Subreddit - This charge is self explanatory

2.    Cirlejerking without a permit - This is filed along with the above charge (2) because the defendant is creating a fraudulent circlejerk subreddit in which him and others circlejerk.

3.    2muchfedorabravery.exe - OP has excess bravery as demonstrated by Exhibit C

4.    Circlejerk1.lol - self circlejerk or the equivalent of masturbating in public.

 Charge 2 comes along with charge 1. The accused created a fraudulent subreddit, but not when they are fradulent and without permit.

Charge 3 - It has become . apparent that the picture posted is not the accused. However deletion of the post may be considered tampering with evidence. These charges will be followed by the DA office if until we are given an explanation of why this was deleted.

 Charge 4 is a simple charge based on the accused behavior, it was not funny and it blinded my dog. This scum must be brought to justice.

1357493556.0,162g9i,Assigning Karma Court case numbers,DellaStreetJustice,23,4,13,"There was [recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1623np/karma_court_records/) touching on the subject of records keeping in which I asked about how case numbers are assigned. The reply was to ""Count how many posts there are and add 1"" which has workability issues:

* If two people simultaneously assign court cases then that can result in a number being assigned twice.
* If a case is deleted it will throw off the count and can also result in a duplicate case number.

To bring order into the assignment of court cases I propose that the court use a standardized system for giving each case a unique identifying case number which will assist in record keeping and search.

I suggest something along the lines of the following:

* Begins with KCCID which stands for Karma Court Case IDentifier. This serves as an explanation for the items to follow.
* UTC date of case posting in Y#### M## D## format to allow for searching all cases from a certain date
* The Reddit post ID
* An optional but recommended inclusion of the offense. I recommend a standardized shorthand for each different charge. M&amp;DB for Misdemeanor Douchebaggery

For example

Standardizing case numbers with a system similar to the above suggestion means that someone can easily search for all felonies on a certain date, these case numbers can be assigned retroactively either manually or better yet with a bot which could just post a comment in the thread assigning the case number.

As much as I would like to see a decrease in Karma crime here on Reddit I'm afraid that there will always be those who try to act outside of the rules of society. With the ever increasing growth of the Reddit user base there will only be more and more cases and a greater need for easily reference specific court cases. There will certainly be instances of repeat offenders and relying on a case name like ""REDDIT V. JOHNDOE"" will not be enough to identify a unique court case.

It is my hope that some form of order can be brought to this court system. Thank you for your consideration.",,t5_2v788,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/162g9i/assigning_karma_court_case_numbers/

*SPO-Senior Prison Officer

""Popcorn"" has long been a part of SubredditDrama since its inception.  In the sidebar of the sub it even provides links to popcorn containing gifs.

After /u/sceptix made his false accusation a downvote brigade arose and beat the fucking shit out of that poor little popcorn eating mouse.    I tried to point out that the mouse was eating popcorn but the downvotes continue. 

One of the moderators of the sub /u/semebay even pointed out the longstanding history of posting popcorn containing gifs in SRD.

**Defense Opening Statements:**  
Ladies and gentleman of the court
The case brought against my client, are the days when the prosecution brought **EVIDENCE** to a courtroom; instead **GUESSWORK** is all you need to press charges. My, oh my, I am utterly stunned that this case hasn't been thrown out of court by now.  

Let's look at the **facts**

/u/ben51959 posted 2 pictures
/u/ben51959 then added two more pictures in the comments section

From what I understand, burnt a 'koosh ball', dug up a hole in a yard, placed the burnt koosh ball next to it, and claimed it was created by lightning. And where did they get this idea from? The comment section, here  

Now

* How can it proven the object in question is a koosh ball? Could it not be any of other ideas suggested by /u/mjw5151

* If it was a koosh ball

* Someone else, he states that ""it's definitely a koosh ball"". So, if the object in question is proven to be a koosh ball, we have been shown hard evidence that lightning cannot be ruled out as the cause of melting, as there has been a precedent.  

The prosecution intends to find an innocent man guilty of a crime he did not commit. On what grounds, nothing but conjecture.  

That concludes the defenses opening statement.  
**Prosecution Opening Statement:**  
The prosecution respectfully calls bullshit on the defense statement.  
In the first photo
The second photo really gives it away. As you can see
Now, metal, lamppost and a tree?
And how likely is it that the second user's ball was also struck by lightning?  
The prosecution rests.

1367884680.0,1dtsuu,COMPLAINT AGAINST /U/H8FUQ FOR DOUCHEBAGGERY: LYING ABOUT POSSESSION OF A GRADUATE DEGREE IN THE FIELD OF DISCUSSION,BassoonHero,25,14,5,"### Complaint

Three days ago, I feel that the wholesale fabrication of such credentials is highly inappropriate, and that the use of a phony graduate degree to claim authority in a debate constitutes the offense of Douchebaggery.

### Evidence

The evidence against /u/h8fuq is circumstantial

- [Exhibit A](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1dm6nw/us_employers_add_165k_jobs_rate_falls_to_75/c9rqifr?context=3): In this comment
- [Exhibit B](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1dh8zl/til_the_us_marine_corps_is_older_than_the_united/c9qf6h9): Here, however, proves that Exhibit A was not a one-time incident.
- [Exhibit C](http://www.reddit.com/user/h8fuq): /u/h8fuq's comment history paints a rather vivid picture. His comments hardly evince basic literacy

The evidence clearly justifies the presumption, viz.:

- A picture of /u/h8fuq's diploma
- Verbal submission of the type of degree and granting instutition

### Remedy

Should this court determine that /u/h8fuq did deliberately misrepresent his credentials

Should the court determine that /u/h8fuq does possess a spurious ""Master's degree"" from an unaccredited institution or ""diploma mill""

Should the court find that /u/h8fuq does possess a *bona fide* Master's degree in economics from a legitimate institute of higher education, then I hereby waive my right under the rules of /r/politics to immunity from ""vote brigading"" insofar as this court may choose to levy downvote penalties.~~

1366490849.0,1crf1v,"The Common-Law, rules of practice and procedure, and the administration of law: a few modest proposals.",Slobotic,12,27

**A Canon of the Common-Law** I propose that a wiki be maintained with links to the record of certain cases. Cases deemed important to the common-law shall be organized therein and be referred to, though not absolutely binding, shall not be ignored without good cause and judges shall explain divergence from established precedent. Citations to unpublished cases shall be accepted by the Court for guidance.

(I realize that the majority of the world's legal systems are civil, however, is much more dependent on the legislature, a body of government which Reddit necessarily lacks.)

This canon should be navigable and broken generally into two sections:

Rules of Evidence and Procedure
Substantive Law Doctrine

Subsections should be according to specific issues. (e.g., admissibility of evidence, jury charges, etc...)

**Intermediate Appellate Division**
Under Article II, however, should be defined. An appeal is not a full retrial. An appeal to a higher court should be citing specific errors made by the lower court. The appellate bench shall decide whether error was made or not. If the Court determines, for example, that evidence used to convict a party should not have been considered by the Court because it was unreliable, inflammatory, or obtained in violation of Reddit policy, the Appellate Judge is therefore refining his work to the very useful task of promulgating rules. A rule might be, and have the effect of *stare decisis* on other Appellate judges. Appellate benches shall function as three judge panels. Two Judges in agreement shall have the power to speak for the court. A dissenting judge shall record his opinion and rationale therefore. A party who loses at the appellate level but has a dissenting opinion in his favor shall be given an appeal to the Supreme Court *as a matter of right* if desired. A party who loses to a unanimous opinion shall have a right to file a petition for certification to the Supreme Court which the Court may accept at its discretion.


**Supreme Court**
The Supreme Court shall be a body that functions as a 7 or 9 or 5 justice bench. (I prefer 7, at least 7 justice must be appointed. In the future, an appellate judge shall be eligible to function as a Supreme Court Justice upon attaining credibility as a judge in the Appellate Division, just as judges shall only move to the Appellate Division upon attaining credibility as a fair trial judge.

The Supreme Court shall accept petitions for certification (I prefer this term to certiorari, shall be issue specific. Rulings of the Supreme Court shall be binding on all lower courts.

**Closing**
In proposing the above I mean only to start a conversation.

In considering this, the constitution of their country, they run the risk of being ignored. Courts do not have armies, so why do the legislatures and governors and presidents obey them? Why don't they tell the court to go to hell and do what they want? 
I have no answer

Legitimacy lies in the rule of law

**EDIT: DL;DR?**

1. Create a library of case law as a reference guide. Run as a wiki.

2. Create an appellate court to provide appeals as guaranteed in KarmaCourt Const. Art. II

3. Limit the jurisdiction of Appellate Division Court to the review of specific errors claimed by the lower court and for the creation of rules to remedy those errors. Appellate Courts are run by three judge panels

4. Create a Supreme Court. Seven Justice panel hear a case. Four justices may render a decision.

5. Supreme Court must take cases from Appellate Division where there was a dissenting judge. They may also grant direct certification (take the case straight from the trial court

6. Redditers with 2000+ karma may serve as judge. Judge shall choose Appellate Division judges. Appellate Division judges shall choose Supreme Court justices. 

7. There may be more than 7 Supreme Court justices

8 Judges in panels who disagree with the majority shall record the reason for their dissent for the benefit of the common law.",,t5_2v788,1366597766.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1crf1v/the_commonlaw_rules_of_practice_and_procedure_and/

However this goes farther than that. His heinous repost not only surpassed the original post in upvotes but the reposter took credit for making the gif.

(1). **Introduction**

Since its inception, make ""ZOMG TERMINAL LANCE"" posts, and gripe about ""Stolen Valor"". Recently, there has been a high volume of non-Marines making posts asking painfully uninformed questions that many subscribers find irritating. For this reason, /r/USMCBoot was created specifically for members who wanted to answer questions to service civilians who wanted to ask them. While most /r/USMC subscribers are not opposed to answering questions about life in the Corps, this setup is more conducive to having a sub with high quality content.

While serving as the Commanding Officer (ie, and only made a response after another Redditor petitioned to take control of the sub. While he was polite in his response, his actions did much to damage unit morale and undermine good order and discipline. /r/USMC is an inappropriate place for subreddit drama, and so it is necessary that this court be convened to give /u/khrist a good tarring and feathering.

Additionally, the RJAG has determined that /u/khrist is unfit for command, and that a good public shaming is in order.

Another element of the case is that the comment should have been deleted and not ""fake edited"".  Even if it was a true edit (which it is not) the comment should have been deleted as it is a douchebaggery way of attaining karma as it has nothing to do with the thread it was posted in and should have been deleted.

1364792382.0,1beksa,PEOPLE OF REDDIT VS /U/DARMON FOR ONE COUNT OF GROSS ABUSE OF FAKE INTERNET POWER,FictionalOrange,11,6,8,"First

1. Background:
/u/darmon is a moderator on /r/gifs

2. Offense:
Earlier today, which was subsequently downvoted into oblivion. The comment in question is [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/nsfw/comments/1bdfth/kayden/c9641wb). Seeing that his comment is crashing and burning, the accused then quickly comments [again](http://www.reddit.com/r/nsfw/comments/1bdfth/kayden/c964mmb), simultaneously complaining about reddit (read: downvotes) and threatening to use his moderator status against the downvoters.

3. Case:
I am a first time poster on /r/KarmaCourt so I am rather unfamiliar with the laws and statutes of this holy sphere of justice. Further, but I feel that the threat of such retribution is a crime itself. If moderators (especially moderators of the most used subreddits) are able to use the threat of a ban to promote their comments, then the proper, natural flow of karma would be disrupted. So, at the risk of being banned from /r/gifs, humbly present offer this case to the learned scholars of /r/karmacourt to adjudicate on both the legality of the case itself and the crime in question. Thank you.

[**##EXHIBIT A##**](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ivd2n/eli5_is_there_a_difference_between_the_devil/)

It’s an early morning in ExplainLikeI’m5, Satan, Damian, etc.? What are they exactly?”. The post itself is a beautiful example of ELI5’s day-to-day content, it’s neutral enough for healthy discussion yet still specific enough for certain experts to have extensive knowledge on the subject.


[**##EXHIBIT B##**](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ivd2n/eli5_is_there_a_difference_between_the_devil/cb8elnr)

/u/deep_sea2 was the first redditor to respond, even dispelling OP’s misconception on the origins of ‘Damien’. It is not soon after that the defendant enters the thread, approximately 4:30am central time. 


[**##EXHIBIT C##**](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ivd2n/eli5_is_there_a_difference_between_the_devil/cb8ets8)

The first words of out the defendant’s mouth:
*“The part about Satan and Devil isn't true but everything else is true.”*
Already

He has also brushed with one of the more subtle rules

The defendant then goes on to describe his own ideas behind OP’s original question.
*“Not so sure on the origin of Satan but the Devil basically watches over Lucifer and all the other evil doers and punishes them. The Devil is gods creation.“* 

Defense may argue that his reply conforms to Paradise Lost's version of the devil
*""The modern day devil that you see in media trying to get people to commit evil deeds and such is actually Lucifer. Because Lucificer has waged an eternal war against God and needs soldiers.""*

This statement by the defendant directly links the characters in Paradise Lost, real, world. This is textbook uninformation, and excuse me if I am overstepping, your honor, but any plea by the defense other than guilty is laughable.

[**##EXHIBIT D##**](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ivd2n/eli5_is_there_a_difference_between_the_devil/cb8euqc)


Evidence that the defendant’s uninformation lead to the direct misinformation of the general public.
This is /u/Deep_Sea2’s comment to the defendant’s initial response

[Exhibit B](http://i.imgur.com/IDecr2c.png)

Here she establishes the cause of death as heart failure most likely caused by obesity and drug use.

[Exhibit C](http://i.imgur.com/CLxe1hc.png)

Here the cause of death is smoking. The court may assume that the defendant could be referring to smoking illicit drugs. However I would like to point out that this post was a response to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/18faa3/why_i_quit_smoking/) thread which clearly indicates tobacco.

[Exhibit F](http://www.reddit.com/user/EleanorTenenbaum/comments/#page=1) 

Peruse her comment history if you will for a moment. Take note, and TV shows, the only thing that isn't American is the Beatles. She even mentions ""That 70s Show,"" which has never been [broadcast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_'70s_Show#International_broadcasts_of_U.S._version) in Sweden, and aired it's last show in America when she was just 13 years old.

###Finally

[Exhibit H](http://i.imgur.com/GELu1ra.png)

# 4: The subsequently deleted [comment posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1bk9sh/9000sins_hangs_out_in_rconspiratard_preemptively/c97ms6f) by the defendant states the defendant's opinion to instate the ban by arbitrary judgement *outside* /r/conspiracy subreddit

# 5: The plaintiff's single, posted over year ago, before the particular topic on /r/gaming was posted that saw controversy when the latter post caught /r/conspiratard users' attention, may have factored in the defendant's decision to instate the ban, stating the plaintiff is banned before he makes further contribution, referring to exhibit # 4. 

The plaintiff argues for the restoration of the posting and commenting rights in /r/conspiracy while conforming to the stated subreddit policy. Referring to exhibit #3, even though the defendant merely posted the topic commentary with a linked artwork in /r/gaming and do not in any way relate to /r/conspiracy except a single older post made on /r/conspiracy months prior) and moderator consensus, which implies the ban decision must be made by the few or several moderators of /r/conspiracy to ban the reddit user from contributing to /r/conspiracy in topic post and comment.

The plaintiff argues the downvote brigade by /r/conspiratard adversely affected the status of the referenced post that originated in /r/gaming. 

The plaintiff attempted to overturn the downvote by apprising the users of /r/whiterights to [voluntarily assist](http://www.reddit.com/r/WhiteRights/comments/1bgzl6/my_post_on_bioshock_infinite_as_antiwhite/) (the post titled ""My post on Bioshock Infinite as anti-white propaganda a few days ago baits the reaction by SRS-type libtards in the last 24 hours. Truth-troll achieved."") in upvote and comment support to counteract the mass downvote and negative, libelous, scurrilous, obscene, and defamatory attacks in the comment thread perpetrated by /r/conspiratard users following discovery and posting on the /r/conspiratard subreddit.

The plaintiff seeks the remedy by the Karma Court by compelling the defendant to rescind the ban on grounds of breaching /r/conspiracy policy

Prior to filing the complaint with the Karma Court, /r/Conspiracy users question abuse of power; mod deletes his comments to cover up"" with the requirement of no participation by related users involved in the saga, including the plaintiff and the defendant. 

The particular post, in his words, ""witch hunt-y"". 

In summary, to unilaterally ban the plaintiff from /r/conspiracy based on the negative impression of the plaintiff's post in an unrelated subreddit, which violates the /r/conspiracy policy prohibiting stalking and [disregarding] preference for moderator consensus on ban decision. 

The plaintiff argues the defendant acts in bad faith that should be the cause for concern in the Reddit culture

The plaintiff has the witness 'papadog' that will attest to the facts of the case against the defendant and /r/conspiratard downvote brigade who may have acted contrary to certain provisions of [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and

20 hours ago /u/hedges747 posted this [image](http://www.reddit.com/r/MoviePosterPorn/comments/190q87/les_miserables_2012_540x811/) to /r/MoviePosterPorn  and has since gained 222 points a fairly large sum considering the average post on /r/MoviePosterPorn gets between 10-50 points henceforth making this a crime of repost.png if it is a repost.

It is a repost unfortunately. This can be shown by the fact /u/unkn0wn1 submitted the same image only a day before to /r/MoviePosterPorn as seen [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MoviePosterPorn/comments/18ziyc/les_miserables_2012_800x1200/) His post only got 15 points

also in /u/hedges747 repost he claimed the dimensions of the image (a required rule of the subreddit) to be ""[540x811]"" however 
according to imgur and my computer the image is actually 800x1200
imgur: i.imgur.com/NHky1Z7.jpg
my pc:i.imgur.com/nc8n3bl.jpg

Now some may claim that /u/hedges747 made a simple mistake in the title or something along the lines of that

Yes my fair court I type no lies
Imgur: i.imgur.com/b235Q9W.jpg
My pc: i.imgur.com/4qA08th.jpg

I believe that /u/hedges747 lied about the dimensions in order to fool readers of /r/MoviePosterPorn into thinking it was a different post or he had used Photoshop skills to enlarge the image for their viewing pleasure 

In addition I have an eye witness testimony from /u/ModestEgg claiming it to be repost as well

In conclusion /u/hedges747 reposted a picture to /r/MoviePosterPorn that was originally submitted by /u/unkn0wn1 then changed the dimensions in the title (without actually changing the dimensions of the image at all) and then gained more than 10 times the amount of karma the original poster got.

Henceforth making /u/hedges747 guilty of repost.png (due it being a repost and gaining karma that's quite large for that subreddit) and False Advertisement due to the lies in the title that where created in an attempt to trick readers into thinking it was a different post or to make more recalling readers think it was an enlargement.

In this post it shows a screenshot of the mod mail showing that i was working as a ""mole"" and that /u/andrewsmith1986 was useing his ""fame"" to try to swade people against many ""famous"" redditors, /u/Apostolate, and others, I can assure you this is all 100% false.  
I guess it would have started in /r/karmacourtgazette, i can not argue against this, i am not a writer and i only joined the subreddit because i was bored, and all that itself was fine.  
But i submitted a story to post about an Subreddit that was coming up that was suppose to be just like /r/karmacourt but more serious, i say with 100 percent honesty that none of that was true, they thought i was trying to advertise the subreddit so it could ""overpower"" karmacourt, this is incredibly false, that itself kind of annoyed me, but not enough to get me mad, it was their opinion and i respect that, I have checked through the entire mod mail, either useing inspect element on google chrome or firebug for firefox
but they refused to show it to the people, but not even letting the people see and decide for themselves? I think that is stupid, I have been on /r/karmacourt for like 5 days and ive already been through, modding, demodding, bans, insults, accusations and more, i am just trying to show people the truth
.  
.  
I think that the whole post about us trying to get the ""power users"" to quit is a ""reverse"" to try to get us to quit
.
They don't like /u/trolaway [+20] because you are the main person to call out /r/karmacourt so they have obvious beef about you starting the new subreddit because without karmacourt
.
I was a Moderator of the gazette until they thought that i was working for the ""other team"" to try to get people away from karmacourt
.
andrewsmith1986 is a ""power user"" so they can easily try to make it seem like he a ""attention thirsty""
.
and they could see how people would be interested in the new subreddit
Im posting this in several posts to get my idea known.
