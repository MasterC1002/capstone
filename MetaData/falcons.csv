The Falcons were playing the Chargers that weekend

The night before the game, one of the kids spots Roddy White sitting at the hotel bar with two other guys. They didn't know it, but one of the other guys was Michael Turner. The third was a staff member. I think he was a trainer. Older bald white guy.

So of course the kid turns to me and says (luckily quietly) ""Hey that's Roddy White! Can we go over there?""

He was clearly starstruck and to be honest, recognizing both White and Turner) said ""Of course!""

They all practically skip to the table. I begrudgingly trudge behind.

When the first of the kids reaches the table

They chuckled. Roddy White made a comment about it being weird that an eleven year old kid knows who he is. When the kids asked for autographs

My fellow chaperon suggested signing the kid's shirts (We were all wearing them

He turned to the trainer and asked him to open his bag. They pulled out two brand new youth sized Atlanta Falcons draft hats

""I hope we win too

One kid came from a Raiders family, both of those kids are die-hard Falcons fans to this day.

We played terribly at the start and didn't have the gas at the end to fuel a major come-from-behind victory that we're know for doing. Carolina came to play. Their season is lost and they wanted to make the statement that their record isn't representative of the team's talent
We are 11-2, that we would drop a couple games at the end of the season. I knew that the Falcons will do what was necessary to lock up the #1 or #2 seed and then start getting in the post-season mind set. The perfect season is gone, and a 11-5 record isn't bad at all. These remaining games have very little importance to what every player in our locker room is hungry for. No one talks about a team's record, after they've won the Super Bowl. The Giants 9-7 record was nothing to celebrate, but their determination and ferocity that they showed in the post-season was what we all attribute to their team now.
Roddy White mentioned, while Atlanta is more focused on making a strong play-off run.
We have NYG next week, we have a shot at building some mad steam for the play-offs. This is one of the games that I expected a lackluster performance. Don't expect to see anything like this against the Giants.
We're where we need to be for the Play-off seeding. After the Giants game
Don't let this game instill you with doubt or embarrassment. Every team in the league has lost more games and some even more costly ones
Grieve until you feel better, and it's time to focus on the NFC Championship, and move on to claiming that prestigious prize of being Super Bowl Champions.

I've been busy the last few years so this was my first trip since the saints SB season. Things have changed drastically. 

These were my seats- http://i.imgur.com/I6kq4.jpg

Not bad at all right? Bought them off stubhub and believe they are from a season ticket holder. Let me preface this with a positive- had a great time in the city last night wearing falcons gear , couple bad apples got called out. I was with 3 others, we all wore our falcons gear. We cheered for our team and made small talk but were not disrespectful. 

However the fans on the way into the stadium, NYC, and even Foxboro and this was the single worst experience of my life. 

Highlights- 
walk in bathroom, go to pee in a stall and a guy starts peeing on the floor in the stall next to me trying to get if on me, sayin ""lick my piss falcons"" , almost get into a fight. 

Walking back to seats- big black dude blocks our way saying we are in his house and need to pay the toll. I laugh it off and he's like ""give me your beer"", etc. 

We texted the fan behavior to
Report him and that's when things got out of hand. They came to talk to him and left. Things got worse from there. The saints fans next to us apologized and we decided to leave mid 4th quarter ( it wasn't fun anymore and things had gotten heated) 

As we are leaving another saints fans

We left and are now at the airport. Fuck you saints fans and your pathetic excuse for security. This is a game

Any suggestions or advice? Im wondering if there is a way to file a complaint with the NFL for a franchise not bring able to control their fan base. This is a game

For about first 10 years of my life in Los Angeles

My close cousin moved out to Atlanta, ""so so"" (he was still suffering from Michael Vick incident)

When I came back to LA, and of course none of my friends were. With lack of football knowledge and experience, I wasn't really a 'loud fan' of Falcons. I watched few games every season, but never really got into it. It's hard to fully engage with the team, when my emotion wasn't really there.

Before this season started, cheering their heart out. It was freaking hot, and I was mess. But the intensity of all Falcons fan and their energy just kept me going. On top of all that, the boys played an amazing game. 

This sure was a big turning point for my relationship with Falcons. 
Only at this moment

This season was great. We did have ups and downs, how we prevailed tough times, how we have an awesome kicker who saved our asses multiple times, how our QB made some clutch TD throws, how our receivers were catching impossible passes, it just didn't seem to matter. 

It sucked big times.

But I found refugee in this sub-reddit. I talked with my cousin quite often

ATL fans, they always came up to me and say ""rise up!"". The positive energy and support for our team is just admirable (compare to millions of Lakers fan in LA).

So
Thank you, but we fought hard.
Thank you
Thank you

Next season

1363371144.0,1ad2kl,ESPN Insider: How Steven Jackson helps Atlanta (in case anybody wants to read),dmarg,48,5,12,"The release of Michael Turner last week confirmed what anyone with eyes knew: The Atlanta Falcons needed a new bell cow in their backfield. After finishing 29th in rushing DVOA in 2012, and was saved from ranking worse only by the fact that the Falcons gave more of his carries to Jacquizz Rodgers over the second half of the season

To fix this problem

The interesting thing about the direction the Falcons chose to go in was that they did the exact opposite of what they did in acquiring Turner in the first place. When general manager Thomas Dimitroff signed Turner in free agency prior to the 2008 season, and that helped drag down Jackson's price to the point where Atlanta could afford to take a chance on him.

Let's set the record straight: Jackson is not the player he once was, 28 in 2010, 20 in 2011 and 19 in 2012. His burst has mostly remained intact, but old running backs tend to crater fast, and there is a good chance that he declines like Turner did before him.

However, and he has worked hard to become a solid pass-catching back out of the backfield, so he won't have to be replaced by Rodgers if Atlanta goes into a hurry-up offense or is running a two-minute drill. Jackson had negative DVOAs in 2010 and 2011, but under Jeff Fisher in 2012 he bounced back to a 5.3 percent DVOA, which was 11th among qualifying backs. Rodgers would likely return to more of a secondary role, though he wouldn't necessarily have to lose many carries because (a) the Falcons could cut Jason Snelling out of the pecking order and (b) the Falcons could conceivably run the ball more if they are trying to bleed more clock next season. Rodgers' skill set calls for that sort of role anyway, and he could still play a defined role on third downs with his 25.7 percent receiving DVOA

Moreover, and 18 of their 37 carries in goal-to-go situations went for zero or negative yards. Jackson actually got better in the red zone last season, improving to an 8.2 percent DVOA. While he has been fairly up-and-down with this over the course of his career, he should still be a big improvement over Turner and the ground game that had trouble getting an inch last season.

Jackson is not going to be a superstar. And he's probably not going to rush for 1, Tony Gonzalez and Julio Jones, he's going to get a chance to be the player whom defenses forget about. The Falcons shouldn't go emphasizing a ground game with Jackson over their star-studded passing attack, but his addition will make their offense much more well-rounded, and should provide benefits in the playoffs and in the red zone by letting the Falcons stay balanced.",,False,t5_2ql17,True

1348789359.0,10labc,Looking back at the 2008 NFL Draft,jaynap1,41,5,14,"I'm sure this has been done to death, who quit with three games left in the season. We went 4-12 after a patchwork of quarterbacks that included Joey Harrington

We lost defensive anchor Pat Kerney to the Seattle Seahawks, several candidates, and were slipping further and further into laughingstock territory. Along the way, though, we landed Thomas Dimitroff, the former director of Patriots scouting, as our new general manager. Mike Smith, was named head coach. Mike Mularkey

On February 15, T Wayne Gandy, CB Lewis Sanders, WR Jamin Elliott, LB Marcus Wilkins and DT Rod Coleman were all released. Some had openly supported Vick, some were in decline, and all retained the stench of the previous season. More releases would come

Going into the draft, and Kansas City for the #3 pick. It came down to a coin flip. The Falcons won, maybe the first real lucky break they had caught in 18 months. There was serious debate between Matt Ryan, a quarterback out of Boston College, and Glenn Dorsey, a defensive end out of LSU. When I say serious debate, I mean experts were split down the middle. Unable to resist the lure of a potential franchise quarterback, Glenn Dorsey has recorded 237 tackles

The fun didn't stop there

Matt Ryan

Sam Baker: A talented but frustrating LT who has started 44 games for the Falcons and continues to improve marginally.

Curtis Lofton: A 4 year presence at linebacker for the Falcons who racked up three consecutive 100+ tackle seasons.

Harry Douglas: A slot receiver in his fourth active season with the Falcons

Thomas DeCoud: A starting safety with 11 INT's and 4 forced fumbles in 61 career games with Atlanta

Kroy Biermann: Has appeared in every game since the Falcons drafted him

That's five key players, the Falcons have drafted well (Julio Jones) and signed valuable free agents (Tony Gonzalez). The draft could have played out much differently, though. 

When Matt Ryan was taken in the first round

The Falcons traded up to get Sam Baker. Had they not pulled the trigger on that trade, TE. They used their remaining second round pick on Curtis Lofton, but future NFL starters Tracy Porter, Ray Rice, Matt Forte, and Jamaal Charles remained on the board. Also, had they not selected Matt Ryan at QB in the first round

The only other team that had an even comparable draft in hindsight were the Baltimore Ravens, it's in the top 3 easily.

I want to show you these two plays from the Week 11 tie game against the 49ers last year (I use these because fuck the 49ers). [Here he is going the extra mile to get the first down with Patrick Willis on his back the whole time.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mive23kPM-E)
[Later in the game we were trailing 21-17 when Steven delivered this incredible block allowing Bradford the TD pass to Pettis.](http://www.abload.de/img/stuff-willhapkb.gif) Last season the Rams were kryptonite to the 49ers and I hope Steven brings that trait with him to the Falcons.

I'm tired of this crap.  Seriously.  I'm tired of watching this team barely play to the skill level of our opponent.  Was Mularkey calling the plays against Arizona?  Are we going to run the ball at all?

I'm tired of my blood pressure boiling watching this offense.  An offense that should make ANY defense in the league shake in their little space boots.  An offense that should, Jones, Gonzales, Ryan,....Turner?  What the hell is wrong with this anemic team that can't string a damn thing together?

There are 30 other NFL teams that would have clobber-knockered us yesterday.  We could easily be sitting at a 5-5 record this year.  Does ANYONE else not see what's happening?  2008?  2010?  2011?  ANYONE?  This is the EXACT same thing.  We have great records stemming from a soft schedule only to be sucker-punched in the first game of the playoffs.  

I'm a Falcons fan 'til I die.  I've sat through a Superbowl loss, a 13-3 season.  There is nothing that can make me stop being a Falcons fan and that's why I am so pissed off.  I have missed maybe 2 games in the past 4 years.  I watch this team every weekend.  I don't pretend I don't see the problems and you can't either.  This team has real issues, and while we are virtual locks for the playoffs, this team is going nowhere once we get there.

Something has to be done and it has to be done fast.  Line play on both sides of the ball has to improve (it won't.  We haven't had a D-line for 5+ years, we need to tackle (we won't), and we need to stop the run (we might).  

I apologize for the rant, the Super Bowl.  As a fan that watches every play of every game we have, I'm being realistic.  We aren't going to get it done.

We're 8-1 to start the season-our best start ever. Ever. With the victories, and we're going to get bandwagon fans. More people supporting the team, more people out on /r/nfl with falcon flair. That can be good, but it can also be bad. There are a couple things I want to discuss right now.

1. The media. 

I know that Atlanta isn't getting the publicity a team like the Packers would be getting if they were 8-1. In the beginning of the season, Ryan, even Douglas. And other people see that too. So when fans are saying that we don't get enough airtime, other people are starting to think that we're just whiny complainers. For now, just keep quiet like the players are doing, and let their play do the talking.

2. Saints rivalry.

These teams have always been rivals, overtimes, 4th and 1's, it doesn't get much better than this. 

I know it stung losing our first game of the season. Especially considering it was our biggest rival. But we cannot wallow in it. We can't take every opportunity we get to talk about last weeks game and bash them. Bringing it up gets old. Bringing up how nasty they've been since Katrina gets old. Same for the bounty system. Part of it's true, arrogant fanbase.

Since Vick left, and I want to be proud of the fanbase as well.

Anyways

1.  We're not totally desperate yet.  We still have the division lead, so you might get a respite from the desperate Giants everyone fears so much.  We're not really good at putting two great offensive games together, so I wouldn't expect us to come out and have a great offensive game.  Our defense was pretty shitty yesterday, with the exception of some great turnovers, and that's been about par for the course for us this year.

2.  This week will be a great time to get your running game going again.  Turner, we can't do our 3 safety look nearly as well, and the run defense suffers greatly from it.

3.  Pass the football too!  We suck equally at defending the pass.  Really

Along with those blessings for you

1.  Don't turn the ball over.  We've been pretty good at turning those events into points

2.  Special teams.  Holy cow, kick the ball through the endzone.

3.  Don't be winning by less than 8 with under two minutes to go and punt to us.  As good as Matt Ryan is in those situations

4.  We might have a running back.  We're not sure yet, be aware of him.  He also has a fumble problem that everyone is convinced he has fixed, but you know...probably not.  Also, he can't pass block for shit, so if he's in there, we're probably running, or throwing quick slants.

5.  Nicks is getting healthy.  You should double him and leave Cruz 1-on-1 with whoever.  Disregard our #3 completely because Eli shouldn't be using him at all.

6.  Black unicorn.  Cover him too.  


One special warning.  There is no way to break down the Giants play on the field.  They are completely inconsistent and are a different team each week.  Different strengths, different everything pretty much.  You could beat us by 50 or we could shut you out.  You never know, and that's what makes the games so incredibly hard to watch as a Giant fan.

With the sixth pick, and two picks in the 2012 draft. Here's how that went:

2011 #27 overall: Phillip Taylor, 1 FF, and started 2012 on the PUP list.

2011 #59 overall: Greg Little, lots of drops, and an attitude problem through 22 games.

2011 #124 overall: Owen Marcacic

2012 #22 overall: Brandon Weeden, a 29 year old rookie QB for a dynamic vertical threat WR? I'll make that trade straight up every time if I get the WR.

2012 #118 overall: Traded to the Vikings. Jarius Wright, and a touchdown in week 4....of the preseason. Yet to catch a pass this season. 

So if Cleveland called and offered Brandon Weeden, and Owen Marcacic for Julio Jones, would the Falcons even listen? For a second? Would the sentence even be completed before Dimitroff hung up the phone? 

Even if we had held on to the first round pick for 2012, Coby Fleener, David DeCastro, and Kevin Zeitler were all on the board but I can't say that I'm heartbroken that we didn't get any of those guys.

But let's be honest. Abe is old. And yes he did have 10 sacks. But what you don't know is that number is inflated. 3 came from the Oakland game alone. 30% came in one game agains the ***Raiders***. And 2 came against *Arizona*. That's 20%. So 50% of Abe's sacks came against less than stellar teams.

 In the last 4 Games: Carolina, TB. He recorded 0. I repeat zero sacks. And you can't blame injury, that happened in TB. Last game.

In the last 6 games of the season he had 1 sack and that was against NO.


And he also had 0 in the postseason. But I'm not really counting that because of the injury.

Since the season began, but traffic has [skyrocketed](http://i.imgur.com/Ue9Mr.jpg). Last month alone we had almost 80,000 page views.  What that means is /r/falcons has become more active than ever.  

Take a look back at some of the more memorable posts and moments from the regular season:



* [The spectacular throw from week 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/10q6au/what_a_throw/)

* [And the now somewhat infamous GIF that came out of the aftermath](http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/10q635/matt_ryan_says/)

While I don't agree with the style of defense that BVG has been running and while I don't like the fact that we gave so much for Julio Jones rather than beefing up our weak sauce O line

Moving forward. Here is what I'd like to see: Mike Smith come out and admit that we gave too much for Jones. I'd like to see him be honest with the fact that we need to beef up our O line and that this

(Re-posted from my comment on r/NFL 32 Greatest Players in 32 days thread)
I would argue that Matt Ryan is better for Atlanta than Deion was. Sure, and did his best work elsewhere. 
Matt, Alge, Dunn, etc.), and everyone still pegged us as the worst team in the league and predicted a dismal 1-15 record for us that year. 
What did Matt Ryan do? He put his head down and got to work, Yds, TDs, Comp. Pct, he's the highest rated passer in the history of the team, and has a chance to break career franchise records for Att, Comp, all while recording back-to-back winning seasons for the first time in franchise history 2.5 times over. He's orchestrated 22 game winning drives in the 4th qtr or overtime
Bottom line. He's the best player on the team during the most successful run in team history. That's why he's the greatest IMHO",self,t5_2ql17,1363982483.0,,matty,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/1athdc/my_argument_for_matt_ryan_being_the_best_player/

For the past two years I've been the representative for the Falcons in the NFL Power rankings that /r/nfl performs every week during the NFL regular season. I have a lot on my plate right now and would like to pass the torch to one of you to lighten my responsibilities.

For those of you not familiar with the power rankings, each representative ranks the 32 NFL teams each week, and all power ranker rankings are compiled into a master ranking. Each representative is also responsible for providing a short blurb (2-6 sentences on average I would imagine) each week during the regular season mentioning the state of their team. The results are posted to /r/nfl for all to discuss.

These are the basics. Feel free to volunteer in this thread by stating your interest and why you would be a good representative for the Falcons

Whomever is chosen, and I think whomever is chosen will enjoy it.

Edit: I'm going to hand over the responsibilities to someone ~~tomorrow (Friday, I will make note of it here. So, if you're interested, there's still time to throw your name in for consideration.

Edit #2: Mattyice318 has been chosen to represent us. This will sound cliche, and if I recall, the highest amount of comment karma. That was enough to put him on top.

The ""fan"" that I went to the game with is a die hard UGA fan. He told me after the game that this loss didn't hurt anywhere nearly as bad as the way UGA lost to Bama. It blew my mind. I literally could not grasp thinking that. I have Falcons seasons tickets and never miss a game. I love this team and felt so invested in it. 

My friend claims that football in the state of Georgia is all about UGA and that the Falcons aren't anywhere nearly as important as UGA. 

My point is that college football is not on the same level as NFL. They have computers and analyst decide their national champion every year. The scheduling is completely bias. The media absolutely has a bias towards certain programs (bama, Mich, Ohio St) and they are the ones that determine so much. 

My other point about the two losses is that UGA wasn't supposed to be competitive in that game. They opened in vegas as a 9.5 point underdog. ATL opened as a 2.5 dog. UGA also got dominated over the course of the game. Bama gave up a special teams TD and had one more turnover and still won. UGA was lucky to even be in a position to win that game. UGA winning that game would have shocked the world. ATL beating SF would have shocked a few people but most people would have just said

We have a QB who is certainly one of the top 10 who has shown flashes of true elite status.

We have a great set of linebackers

Yet all I hear people talk about is how much they want to win a playoff game. Screw that, New England. Why? Because they are quality franchises who think that every year they should win the Superbowl, and anything less is a failure.

We may never have a better chance at getting to a Super Bowl with this current group of players than this season. Next year we will be rebuilding our OL, and our best pass rusher will be 35 years old, plus we have a brutal schedule. With an easy path to home field advantage laid out in front of us and a NFC where every team is flawed, just winning a playoff game is not enough, it's time to take the next step towards becoming a perennial contender, and the only way to do that is if we make it to the Superbowl.

1376338326.0,1k88tr,2013 Prediction Thread (I predicted 13-3 record and NFCCG opponent and outcome last year),DonEliado,19,7,29,"Sitting in an airport having a similar moment of clairvoyance like [last year] (http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/11568m/lets_predict_the_rest_of_the_season/) and want to get in on paper. 

Game 1 - 
@ NOLA Close game but Falcons always have trouble meeting the Saints passion at home, etc. 
Falcons lose late and close. 0-1. 

Game 2 - 
V RAMS- Home Opener - SJAX on fire

Game 3 - 
@ Miami - 
 One of those 2013 type games like v OAK. Falcons struggle early

Game 4- 
V New England - Worst game of the season

Game 5 
@ NYJ - Falcons play a complete game on offense and defense

Game 6 
V TB - Typical TB game, stay behind until the end of the game when they decide to turn it up and win by a FG. 4-2 

Game 7 - 
@ Arizona -For some reason I have a bad feeling about this game. It is one of those classic trap games where it should be an easy victory but something goes wrong and now falcons are faced with two tough games and sitting 4-3. 

Game 8 - 
@ Carolina - road game at Carolina is close. Falcons have trouble stopping Cam Newton but his mistakes and the panthers lack of defense keep ATL in the game. It is close until the 4th quarter. Falcons keep an 6 point lead on a defensive stand. 5-3. 

Game 9 
V Seattle- 
Falcons figure out Wilson and destroy Seattle


Game 10 - 
@ Tampa Bay
I've been to enough games at TB to know for a fact they water down the field before the Falcons come to town. It is always slow and sloppy. However, 7-3 

Game 11
V New Orleans - 
Revenge game for the Falcons who have had this on their lockers since opening week. Saints are a game ahead in the playoff race and this evens things up. Brees fights back late but can't make the plays. Falcons win on defense - 8-3. 

Game 12 - 
@ Toronto  V Buffalo 
I'll be at this game and it will be a nice little blowout. One of those fun games where everything is pretty much wrapped up in a bow by mid 3rd quarter and I get to go drink and party with Canadians. 
9-3 

Game 13 - 
@ Green Bay- 
Green Bay in December? Falcons fall late due to the referees love affair with Aaron Rogers. Some sort of BS call pisses us all off and we swear we are done with the NFL. 
9-4 

Game 14- 
V Washington - 
RG3 is injured and it is an easy bounce back win for the birds. 
10-4

Game 15-  
@ San Francisco 
Playoff implications here as both teams are vying for their division and a first round bye. Both teams are hesitant to bring out the playbook since they knew they will probably meet again soon.  Falcons play too conservative

Game 16 
Carolina- 
Must win game for the Falcons to seal the division and a #2 seed. Intense game with Newton racking up big numbers
Newton makes a mistake to lose the game for CAR

PLAYOFFS 
Saints / Cowboys / Packers / Giants 

Bye - #1 49ers

Saints beat the Cowboys 
Packers beat the Giants 

Divisional Round - Falcons V Saints 
The only reason the Falcons win this game is the home crowd. The pure crystal clear hatred of the Saints makes the noise unbearable. A few penalties cost the Saints the game

49ers clean the Packers clock again. 

NFCCG - @ San Fran 
REVENGE. Falcons DOMINATE the game. Some D player goes crazy and gets 4 sacks, Im not being a homer (see below) I think we finally get to the promised land playing a complete playoff game. 

SUPERBOWL XLVIII

He'll talk about his Super Bowl winning season with the Atlanta Falcons in the 2013 season. He's going to say how humble he was that every member of that team used him as a motivation and inspiration to give it their all that year. Being the humble guy he is

Of course, is this really that far-fetched? It could easily be reality if the Falcons can make it in the big one this year.

But what if it doesn't? Tony said that this would absolutely be his last season in the NFL. It's all or nothing this year. Does this change his legacy? Probably not, everyone of his teammates and all of us as fans? What I'm trying to highlight is the fact that this is going to be emotional year for us no matter what happens. We love the man, hell, we even have a picture of him on our sidebar. We will care about him no matter what.

So much is riding on this year. As a fan, doomed to fail, get used to it, blah blah blah, always choking. Seriously though, look at our team and how much talent we have. Look at our coaching staff and what they've already accomplished. I feel like we are the best we've ever been in team history. We have as good of shot as anyone else in the NFL, if not better to win the Superbowl

I bought them again in 2010 and have upgraded each season. This past year we upgraded to 4 seats in the 200 levels. It changed the cost of my seats so it changed our monthly costs. We just made $700 dollar payments. The last payment was due June 3rd. The balance after may was $752. The June monthly payment was made to finish it up. It left a balance of $52 out of the $2795 that was the total costs. I called my rep a week ago to clear that up the balance because I saw an email that said the ""deadline"" had passed. My rep was no longer employed there so I called the general number and got a voicemail. I left a voicemail. A few days go by and I never got a call back. Meanwhile

Tonight I decided to log into my account and see what the deal was because I figured I could just pay it over the PC.....

No balance. No invoice. No previous invoices. Nothing. My account is blank.

Basically the falcons released those 4 seats and after reading something on the FAQs

I never expected

First and foremost, everything is now very readable including the sidebar and flair.  As I stated in a comment earlier this week it has been on my list for a while, and I needed to make sure I could do it the way I wanted.  I think I accomplished that, and I hope everyone who uses night mode can enjoy it.  Having said that, I may have missed a few spots.  If you find a page or part of a page that isn't showing up in a readable way, click on [this link](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=cjdimino&amp;subject=Falcons%20CSS%20bug)(It's in the sidebar as well), and send me a message about what is wrong.  

While I was working on night mode, so if you guys want to give me suggestions in the comments, that'd be great.

Secondly, and i think they'll be fun.  

I'm still getting around to fulfilling all the flair requests

Thats all folks.
