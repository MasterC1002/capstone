Q: Can an FFL ship a firearm to an address that is different from the business premises address identified on the license?
Yes. Neither the GCA nor its implementing regulations contain specific provisions, storage location, or other address where the licensee intends to ensure safe and secure receipt of the firearms.

Source: http://www.atf.gov/publications/newsletters/ffl/ffl-newsletter-2006-03.pdf

You should also be certain that the person is indeed an FFL holder. It is not required that an individual (non-FFL) have a copy of the license; but you should believe in some manner (business card

An individual cannot use the USPS (Post Office) to ship a handgun
There should be no indication on the outside of the package that it contains a firearms. Like Joe’s Gun Shop

Q: May a nonlicensee ship a firearm through the U.S. Postal Service?
A nonlicensee may not transfer a firearm to a non-licensed resident of another State. A nonlicensee may mail a shotgun or rifle to a resident of his or her own State or to a licensee in any State. The Postal Service recommends that long guns be sent by registered mail and that no marking of any kind which would indicate the nature of the contents be placed on the outside of any parcel containing firearms. Handguns are not mailable. A common or contract carrier must be used to ship a handgun.
[18 U.S.C. 1715

Q: May a nonlicensee ship a firearm by common or contract carrier?
A nonlicensee may ship a firearm by a common or contract carrier to a resident of his or her own State or to a licensee in any State. A common or contract carrier must be used to ship a handgun. In addition
[18 U.S.C. 922(a)(2)(A), 27 CFR 478.31 and 478.30]

Q: May a nonlicensee ship a firearm by common or contract carrier?
A nonlicensee may ship a firearm by a common or contract carrier to a resident of his or her own State or to a licensee in any State. A common or contract carrier must be used to ship a handgun. In addition

Source: http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/unlicensed-persons.html

Never ship a loaded gun and never package ammo with a gun. Never ship ammo by USPS....only UPS/FedEx.

Q: What record-keeping procedures should be followed when two private individuals want to engage in a firearms transaction?
When a transaction takes place between private (unlicensed) persons who reside in the same State, a private individual may buy a firearm from another private person who resides in the same State. It is not necessary under Federal law for a Federal firearms licensee (FFL) to assist in the sale or transfer when the buyer and seller are “same-State” residents. Of course, the transferor/seller may not knowingly transfer a firearm to someone who falls within any of the categories of prohibited persons contained in the GCA. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g) and (n). However, as stated above, there are no GCA-required records to be completed by either party to the transfer.

There may be State or local laws or regulations that govern this type of transaction. Contact State Police units or the office of your State Attorney General for information on any such requirements.

Please note that if a private person wants to obtain a firearm from a private person who resides in another State

There are going to be some changes made both in policy and in the way the subreddit is presented. I'm going to outline them below:

* Links will now be colorized according to the type of transaction (Color suggestions welcome).

* Links will prioritize the color based on the FIRST tag (i.e. ""WTS/WTT"" will categorize as ""WTS"").

* Links will fade once visited in order to make new posts more visible.

* Users will have the ability to sort links by transaction type (e.g. ""WTS"" only or ""WTB"" only).

* Users will have the ability to sort links by state.

* Links will now be given a small flag to indicate which state the transaction originates in.

* We will be cracking down on improperly formatted posts. Please format your post as follows:

    *Example:* [WTS] Colt AR-15 .223 [NY]

    Note that the transaction type is at the beginning and the state is at the end.

* Buyers and sellers can become verified by the moderation team and given ""approved buyer/seller"" flair. If you engage in a successful transaction

* Conversely

* If your transaction is completed successfully

* If you suspect someone is engaging in illegal or fraudulent activities

* Finally

Let me know if you have any suggestions or feedback. As always

1. Dealers **MUST** put **""FFL""** in their thread title. Not sure if you're a dealer? Easy guideline: If you can't sell the gun in a FTF transaction
1. **ALL WTS** ads must have an **asking price.** Whether it's the price you'll let it go for or not doesn't matter
1. **NO LINKS** to auction sites (Action Arms, Cruffler, Craigslist etc.) This reddit is not designed to be a place to dump your link onto, take the time to post a real ad.
1. There is **NO AD-STOMPING**. Don't like the price

*How do I buy or sell a gun using Reddit?*


* This Reddit is only meant to connect the potential buyer and/or seller of a firearm


* **Post what you have


*  Post title should read something like:  **WTS/WTT/WTB  GUN/PART/ACCESSORY (State)**


* **Make sure you add a price in the body


* Although not required


* Sellers can prefer not to ship a firearm out of state

* No links to auction sites or ads hosted elsewhere. This reddit is not intended to bring traffic to Gunbroker/Gunsamerica


* **make sure you check all laws applicable to yourself and the buyer/seller. **




*So I bought/sold a gun from/to someone out of state


* As the buyer, is go to your local FFL, and tell them that you need to transfer a gun in from out of state. Your FFL will be able to assist you.
The idea is

(Pro-tip: If the FFL is not willing to give out their FFL to an individual

* Once this is completed, call in, wait time, or whatever your state requires. 


Simple as that!

*A few more pointers*

** Be aware, and you're not aware of the legality of the transfer, research it, or ask. **

* Funds can typically be transferred via Certified Mail, although if Paypal finds out you're violating their policy, you will lose the fund. 

* Gunbroker has a [FFL Search Function](http://www.gunbroker.com/FFL/DealerNetwork.aspx) for those who don't have a ""Regular"" dealer they use. 

* Example Bill of Sale can be found [here](http://www.kcarmstrader.com/billofsale.pdf).

If you see something you like please comment with ""I'll take XXXX"" and then shoot me a PM. If you are interested in an item but need more info or want to haggle me down and take food from my children's mouths (I don't even have kids) then just shoot me a PM. First come first serve

As for payment I accept DISCREET PayPal (If you mention gun stuff on the transaction and get my account frozen, PM me and maybe we can work out a deal for a USPS Money Order or indentured servitude.

I tried to be as fair with prices as possible (Checked Ebay for going rates and tried to undercut the competition a bit)

Here is the breakdown of the rifle and what has been done to it:

- SLG95

- MagPul PRS-2 Stock - $250

- Bolt Microslicking (Dry Film Lubricant) - $150

- Wide Texture Forearm with H&amp;K G3 Bipod - $148

I took this thing in from an owner who had it since the and it was, and installing a Tactical-Mag release on it) and decided to turn it into a target and combat rifle. It has a Magpul PRS-2 sniper stock along with a microslick treatment to the bolt for a smoother action. It runs like a charm and has eaten anything I fed it, even Iraqi surplus (~80 rounds of test ammunition through it). I've got the original handguard, stock, a few replacement parts and armorers tools I will send with it as well should you buy it.

I recently sent the pistol to Kimber and had them re-do the finish in addition to completely changing the upper of the gun to an internal extractor. 

This upgrade drastically improves reliability.

I've come on some bumpy times financially and need to make ends meet. So sadly today I am putting this M1 Carbine up for sale. 

[PICTURES HERE](http://imgur.com/a/MGsrq)

Details:

This rifle is an Israel Arms International model, I have added the following:

* Flip Sight: $30
* 15-Round Mag Pouch: $30
* Oiler and Sling: $15
* 15-Round Magazines: 3 Korean-made (2 marked ""U"", $60 total
* 30-Round Magainzes: 2 Korean-made (Both marked UU) $25 each
* Bayonet: $20

I have fired approximately 300 rounds from this rifle and it's been a joy. The only failures I've had were with steel case ammunition, small to medium game hunting, home defense, or reenacting if you're so inclined.

Houston area, the better and the more I'll be willing to pay. I'm North of Houston until saturday afternoon so if you're anywhere close to I-45 between Huntsville and League city, or close to Beltway 8 between Bush Airport and the ship channel/Pasadena I'll be passing through that way anyway.

I would rather have metal than poly, if you know enough about firearms to have an extra lower laying around, then know what's fair. 

I'd like to keep it under or around $100-$150, tools, or other build parts to throw in with it let me know also and I might be convinced to pay more. PM me and I'll get the cash, I have parts in the mail and I'm itching to get started.",Completed,False,,False,t3_1e0uuu

UPDATE: This is a BSA Sweet 22 3-9x40mmIR (illuminated reticle). It is brand new, and replacement battery. This scope automatically adjusts trajectory on 36, 38, and 40 grain .22LR rounds. To do this, you need to plug in the right distance. It is illuminated green reticle, shock proof, water-proof, selling 2 of them.


~~[Newer wolf ammo .223 20 round box](http://imgur.com/a/2i0IU)-$4.50 a box

55 grain full metal jacket, polymer coated. Before this becomes a thread about the validity of Wolf ammo, allow me to clear some things up. Older wolf ammo got a bad rep because they lacquer coated the rounds, causing barrels and parts to get gummed up. Acetone was the cure for that. Wolf has switched from lacquer coating to polymer because of the lack of sales or some other irrelevant reason. 

The bad now - it is steel cased, it is really dirty. I mean like, you don't want to fire more than 400 rounds or so, that is when mine started to smoke pretty bad. Also, in an AR, you wont want to dry fire this or lubricate the bolt too much, results in lots of smoke and teary eyes.

The good - 22 cents a round. just requires a little more attention on your part. Polymer coated

I'm looking to sell a gently-used CZ-75B in .40S&amp;W with the satin nickel finish. It's a fantastic pistol (the finish is 100%) and I'm only selling it because I'm not a fan of .40S&amp;W and I've already replaced it with a CZ-85 Combat. It's had 108 rounds through it. Comes with two factory 10 round magazines, unfilled warranty registration card and factory test target), and unused cleaning rod/brush. Missing the fired casing (might be able to locate it, though).

Also looking to sell a police trade-in H&amp;K USP in .40S&amp;W. Again, VA. Comes with two 13 round magazines (one of which is a ""restricted"" post-ban magazine, pictured). It has some holster wear, so I'd estimate the finish to be between 85% and 90%. I've put around 25 rounds through it, with an unknown number before that.

*  ""Accurate"" for a Mosin

*  Good bore (see above)

*  Round receiver

I am wishing to start a project build, Bubbafying it.  This will include a barrel shortening and receiver drilling/tapping, so counter-bored and rearsenaled rifles are fine with me.  Stock condition is also unimportant since I will be replacing it (if it doesn't have a stock, I'll still take it).  Stockless would almost be preferred since I don't really want an extra laying around.  I will also be in no need of a bayonet.

This is Serial Number 16 of the special Cabela's Edition of the Witness 45 ACP / 22lr combo.  The gun is in a special brown (FDE) version of their ""Wonderfinish""

This gun is clean as a whistle (I have an ultrasonic cleaner and take extremely good care of my guns) and shoots just fine.  I am selling it because I got a MKIII hunter and I'm TRYING to buy a FNX 45 Tactical

Comes with:

* FDE full sized steel frame (Serial number is CAB0016)

* FDE .45 ACP complete slide

* Black .22lr complete slide

* 3x 10rd factory magazines in 45ACP

* 1x 10rd factory magazine in .22lr

* Complete box with original papers

Condition of the gun is like new, and not sure about the 22, but more.  The cleanliness of this gun will surprise you.  Always kept in humidity controlled safe, and always cleaned and lubed, and occasionally cleaned with my ultrasonic.

Everything is stock on this gun.  The 45 slide was replaced by the factory recently and it has not been shot since

Asking $500

Trades I'll entertain:

* Sub2000 in .40 with Glock mags

* Sig P938

* Mossberg MVP

* Kel-Kec KSG

* toward a FNX 45 Tac FDE

* Taurus PT100 or PT101 in SS

* I have positive feedback on snipershide.com

* CZ's.  A CZ 75 of some sort + cash if necessary or I'd love to find a CZ 97B.  If someone has a CZ 75 with the .22 Kadet kit
* I would consider a Glock + cash.  Preference would be a standard size or compact and not the subcompacts.
* Beretta 92 with the INOX finish.  I like all 92's
* Ruger 77/357 or MAYBE a 77/17.
* A nice .22 caliber AR isn't out of the question either.

Remington 1100:  This is a 2 3/4"" 12GA 1100 with a bead ""FULL"" barrel cut down to 22"" with a brass bead installed.  It has a Remington factory +2 extension, GG&amp;G side sling mount and a Streamlight flashlight mount.  The whole thing (minus the magazine extension tube) was sandblasted, parkerized and painted in Brownells black moly-resin for a tough finish.  The Remington tube was added after I refinished it and is still in bare parkerizing.  Spares included: extra o-ring gas seals, 2 +2 Remington magazine springs, and a spare bolt handle.

The barrel is longer than the extension because I had it cut off even with the Choate magazine extension it was wearing previously

Gun runs great

For an additional $150 I can include a 1100 2 3/4"" 26"" VR MOD barrel that was also parkerized and painted in grey moly-resin

Looking to get rid of my Px4 9mm. Originally bought it because I bought a Cx4 and loved it, Px4 it is. 

Comes with:

 * 2 mags (willing to throw in another if need be)
 * 3 Holsters : Comp-tac MTAC IWB Holster
 * Box with manuals
 *Weird cylinder thing in the box that appears to serve no purpose but bear the Beretta logo and keep the box from getting squished. 


Can throw in rounds or cash to sweeten trade for .40 VTAC

Willing to trade for M&amp;P full size .40 or sell the whole package for $550. Selling piece by piece would be kind of annoying.  FTF in Western Washington only at this point.
