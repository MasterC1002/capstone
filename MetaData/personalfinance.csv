1369924458.0,1fc6dm,"Never, EVER, co-sign a loan",archie_f,1430,439

About 10 years ago my best friend called me up. He'd graduated from an expensive private school with ~$100k in student loan debt

At the time, ever. So I told my buddy sorry, but no. 

Unfortunately

Fast forward 10 years. Found out recently that, and he's defaulted on his student loans and the debt collectors are pounding on his door, taking his car, garnishing wages, taking out liens, etc. 

And if I had agreed to co-sign those years ago

Thank the Old Gods for my dad's wise advice

EDIT: Interesting minority of folks here chiming in to say they co-signed X loan with no problems. Some get lucky, though.

EDIT 2: So many horror stories. Anyone considering co-signing a loan should be required to read through these comments first. ",,t5_2qstm,1369950290.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1fc6dm/never_ever_cosign_a_loan/

There is a problem that I have been noticing more and more each day. I think that it's a pretty big one

Not everyone is the same! Not everyone lives the same life that you do. They don't have the same goals; the same interests. Not everyone cares about saving 15%+ for their retirement at age 23. Not everyone wants that advice. They came here for a reason, especially the OP. I'll be the first to admit that I sometimes do the same thing, but I'm definitely trying to get it out of my system (both on here and in real life).

My point is that not everyone cares about saving $57 over the course of 2 years by paying the highest interest loan off before the others. Not everyone cares that their car in hemorrhaging money. Not everyone is willing to cut cable, you can give them the option they come here asking for help on their budget, but it definitely doesn't need to be in the majority of the threads. 

The most recent example that led me to this post:

* [Refinancing car? Also student loan questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/180ueo/refinancing_car_also_student_loan_questions/)   

He has a couple pretty simple questions about refinancing and his student loan situation. A simple, blah, student loans, blah.""  Maybe throw in something about maybe trading the car for something else.

What does he get? Bombarded with comments that offer nothing more than to criticize him buying a car. He gets almost no help with the questions that he actually had. Who are we to tell someone how to live their lives? His car may be the only thing that he enjoys to do. He spends $600 a month on it

* Just automatically give the max.  I started in 2000.  My salary was $62, I never considered myself having a salary of $62,000.  It was a salary of $51,500.  Note though that if you are in a low tax state or in a low tax bracket, a 401(K) Roth may be a better answer.

* Be aggressive but diverse.  For the first 10 years, and after 10 years, it was 60% of my portfolio.  When my company got acquired, I later switched to an even more diverse portfolio, with more emerging stocks, world stocks, Russell indexes

* Take advantage of company matching.  This is a no-brainer.

* And here is the most important thing - Don't listen to loser poor people!  Loser poor people are people who maintain a poor mentality that will keep them perpetually poor.  Not to be confused with broke people, that this latest recession is the downfall of American society.  I'm 35 - and I've heard it all from the loser poor people.  In the early 90s recession, the Japanese were going to buy us out and we would all be slaves to them, Mexicans would take ALL the jobs, and Generation X was full of slackers would be the first generation that is poorer than their parents.  Then, in the early 2000s, terrorists would create a world where we could all die, where America will magically fall apart again, have maybe 1/10th the wealth

* Trust in the economy.  I mean do the math.  Personally, $160K from my pocket - but it is now worth $401(K).  And since January 2000, when I started, the S&amp;P is up, what, 8%?  How does that work?  Well, company matching, the market went down, drawn out plan.  Fuck

I started a throwaway account because I'd like to share a little bit more personal detail about my situation.  Here it goes:

29 years old.  Married.  Two kids born in '08 and '10.  Graduated in 2011 in Construction Management with $27k in student loans.  I was working in an internship that rolled into a full-time job at $45k/year after I graduated.  

My wife and I both fell into the trap of thinking ""We deserve some sort of reward for all the hard work we've done"" and went out and got two cars totaling $20k in loans.

A few months later we saw the light after sitting down and putting a budget together to see when we could realistically have a good down payment for a home.  We were saving ~$300 while making the minimum payments on all of our debt.  A down payment seemed impossibly far away.

One thing led to another and over the next 19-20 months we sold both cars and replaced them with a beater that I bought for $1 from my father-in-law

After a year at my job I got a promotion and a raise to $55k/year and by then we were aggressively paying off our debt.  Just this past March I got another raise to $62k/year and a $6k bonus that helped push us to make our last lump sum payment towards our [student loan debt](http://i.imgur.com/AVDk6Ql.jpg). 

What I'm actually most proud of is that we've cut our monthly expenses down from ~$3200/mo to $2100/mo while our income has increased dramatically.

We're now saving ~$1800/mo towards an emergency fund and a down payment on a house as our two bedroom/two bath apartment is feeling a little small as our kids get older (and bigger).

http://gamingyourfinances.com/2013/06/12/tips-for-college-graduates-avoid-lifestyle-inflation/


Tips to avoid Lifestyle Inflation:


Pay Yourself First:

Set an automatic amount to come off your paycheck directly into a savings account. Use this money for an emergency fund, or early financial independence. Start with a simple budget and learn how to control your expenses. You’d be surprised how a few $’s here and there add up to over +10% of your net income. Aim for a 20-25% savings rate at first and increase that over time with future raises.


Bank those Salary Increases:

Put a large portion of any salary increase automatically into your savings account. Putting away 75% of your net increase is a good guide. Leave yourself with 25% as a reward for your hard work but put the rest into savings each month. This will help you increase your savings rate from 25% to 50-60% over time.


Choose Friends Wisely:

It’s not hard to spend $150 on a fun night out at the bars


Pick the right Status Symbols:

Status symbols are easy ways to waste money. Typical status symbols include a fancy car, high tech toys etc. Purchasing these items typically result two negative effects. Number one, they suck up a lot of your disposable income. Number two they result in a form of self-segmentation, you’ll find yourself in a new high spending social group who values this type of consumer lifestyle. Less expensive status symbols include personal health/fitness, life experiences, travel and your personal attitude, optimism and confidence. These things also affect your social status but are far less expensive. These social groups also put less value on money and consumption.


Buy things Slightly Used:

One of the great things about lifestyle inflation is that everyone else is doing it! Take advantage and get great items for a fraction of the cost by buying slightly used from Craigslist. Decide on what you need and start browsing Craigslist periodically. Guaranteed


Invest in Quality:

No one said you can’t spend your hard earned money,,False,,t5_2qstm,1371172043.0,,True

**Edit:** Some people asked

I went to a bank branch and talked to the service manager. He was a polite soft spoken Indian guy. I asked about the most recent fee and it turns out this time it was due to a low balance on one of my savings account. I transferred money out of the savings and into my checking the day prior, and they want to charge me $5 over some shit like this? 

I told him I wanted to close my accounts. He never offered to refund the $5.  While he was filling out the paperwork I told him about how I'm a long standing customer and feel mistreated by the bank.

*Have a good defense*. I made my budget and I stuck to it. Overall I placed around 60% of my take home towards debt. When my budget got a little wonky around September

*Always be learning*. 'The Total Money Makeover' was my first financial book. Since then I've read 'The Millionaire Next Door' and 'The Boglehead's Guide to Investing'. I see how the knowledge I gain at this moment can drastically change my future for the positive! I'm soaking it up!

1366490610.0,1crer7,The Top 5 Most Common Mistakes and Controversial PF Advice!,Bankster88,490,112,157,"There are two things I want to say before I get started: 

**EDIT** 

Let me make a clarifying statement/caveat: I made this thread to offer higher-income households an alternative view of how to think about wealth creation.

First

Second, but I acknowledge my advice is of limited value. You need money to make money.  


**Conservatism to a fault.** Everyone wants to be conservative, there should be a discussion of risk vs. reward. As a example, I often see this:

OP:  Should I buy a house as an investment property? I have NO experience as a landlord.

Reddit: This is a bad idea. Tenants could be troublesome

Bankster1: Great- thanks for listing the bear case. What about the bull case? What about a base case? Tenants could be great

Since you have no experience


**Debt elimination vs. wealth creation.** It seems to be that people on here have a skewed sense of what debt is and what interest is. I think the best way to describe my view would be through an example: I still have ~$15

1)	Yea

2)	Again

3)	Interest is the cost of borrowing. Decomposing the total cost of a mortgage into principal and interest over a 30-year period is comparing apples and oranges since it ignores inflation, etc...  


**Lifestyle inflation is not a sin, but to chastise people because they're only saving 20% of their income when they have the potential to save 50% is ridiculous. It's all about balance and no one should confuse responsible personal finance with the goal of minimizing one's living expense. Mr.MoneyMustache says some pretty stupid things about this, imo. Some of the greatest experience in life are free, but more often than not, a great experience comes with a big bill. Sometimes it's worth the expense.  


**Early retirement is the dream!** I want to use this bullet point to expand on the above. I often see someone who just got a new job making ~$100K a year and the first things Redditers advise is ""keep living like you're still earnings $25K and you can retire in 10-years!"" I couldn't disagree more. First of all, especially if they like their job. I think work can be a great way to spend the day. Plus, even if I did retire all my friends and family would still be working. Third, the early retirement math implies no lifestyle inflation. I think it's a bad trade off to commit yourself to continue to live like a college student (which gets boring real quick) just so you can retire early when you're healthy enough and smart enough to continue building your wealth and improving your quality of life.   


**What about others?** No one on here talk about the cost of a friend's wedding or a parent's birthday. I love being able to buy my friends a bottle of Johnny Blue or my dad an iPad. Sure it kills my savings rate for the month but being able to give back feels good.

For what it's worth, don't look at your home as the key to starting your investment portfolio. Save and emergency fund, start saving for retirement, get rid of your high interest debt. If you can do those things while renting - then you are still ""investing"" and you are just paying for your shelter.

So in addition to running the numbers on your mortgage, and closing costs (which can be anywhere from a few thousand to up to $10k).

Then, for us it was water.

Now here is some data I've been collecting and thought I'd share. We've owned our home three years now. Here is a breakdown of expenses by year for the home in three key categories -- Needs (ex: fix the roof), and this is a home built in 1950 in the northeast.

2011
Needs: $11k
Wants: $5k
Furniture: $6k
Total: $22k

2012
Needs: $8k
Wants: $500
Furniture: $1500
Total: $10k

2013 (6 months in)
Needs: $1200
Wants: $200
Furniture: $0
Total: $1400

3 year total
Needs: $20k
Wants: $5
Furniture: $7
Total: $33

You can see how expensive the first year was and even year two. But now year three has been a lot less expensive. We are more settled on furniture

When we bought our home we knew there was work that needed to be done, I'm just sharing what we did. And in the first year, most of the needs we knew about going in (make sure if you know work needs to be done, get an estimate BEFORE you sign the P&amp;S), so you know what the needs are.

Think of it coming from your 10 year future self ;)  

DEBT
If you are 20 something and in CC or student loan debt your main focus should be paying off your loans even if they have a manageable monthly fee.  CC debit is terrible.  If you have CC debt stop what you are doing and cut expenses and get that paid off.  Student loan debt should also be paid off as soon as you can even if the interest rate is lowish.  If you are in debt and see others posting about investing and start feeling like ""maybe i should start investing too!"" please realize that PAYING OFF YOUR DEBT IS INVESTING IN YOUR FUTURE.  Paying off your debt means guaranteed return on your money and you'll be getting out of paying some company tens of thousands of dollars. This is money that is coming straight out of your future self's bank account.

Once you get out of debt be very wary of debt.  Remember that nobody gets anything for free.  Debt just means someone else is making money off of your shortsighted vision of the future.  The easier the debt is the more money they are making off of you.  

INVESTING
Once you are out of debt investing is important so if you are 20 something and asking questions about investing you are in great shape.  Take a deep breath and know that the most valuable investment you can make is to learn about the basics of investing and building up the habit of investing.  Knowledge gathering and habit forming are way more important than what specific mutual fund you invest in.  It takes time so be patient and learn before you invest.  Over time knowing what you are investing will be much more important than an extra month or two in the stock market.  Ask questions like ""what should i look for in a mutual fund?""

LIVE BELOW YOUR MEANS
This is by far the most important bit of information I can pass on to you.  We live in a culture that does not encourage this but please please please live below your means.  Avoid the temptation of lifestyle inflation.  Keep track of your expenses and know where your money is going.  Remember it isn't how much you make that counts but how much you keep.

That is all.  Be well fellow denizens of the internet.

*Dear mint.com users


*I do want you to know that I have been monitoring all of your comments and passing them on to management. Please believe me when I say that they are not falling on deaf ears. And, for all of the planning, preparation, and training we at KSA have undergone, several things have occurred both inside and outside of our control that have drastically affected our ability to provide the quality customer service we are so determined to deliver. Those issues are being worked on as expediently as humanly possible, including the problems with the phone line licenses (why you are receiving a fast busy or call back later message or not getting through at all). However, these issues will not be resolved overnight. We are also requiring mandatory overtime for staff, and performing additional document processing and e-mail queue work on the weekend. This will continue until all issues are resolved and servicing reaches an acceptable level.*


*If you submitted payments to your previous servicer, the correspondence queue currently being worked is on Feb. 1st; the repayment plan queue (e.x. IBR processing) is on February 2nd; the e-mail queue is on February 8th; and the deferment/forbearance queue is on Feb. 18th. Call wait time is still very high, due in part to this problem with phone line licenses, but if you do get through - I *strongly* encourage you to select the option to receive a call back to the number from which you dialed. It may take 24 hours to receive a call back.* 


*Finally


*If I can be of any other general assistance


*Sincerely


*Erin*

My boss is a woman who doesn't listen well, she stares at me while smiling and just blinks a few times, she'll hold the gaze too [intimidation tactic? it's so weird]. She also bad mouths everyone she works with in upper management, a lot of gossip too.

The situation: My mom had an IRA at a different bank and wanted to move it, it's a terrible deal just as an Annuity but here's the worst party: It's not an IRA but my boss thinks it is. She told us in writing it's a tax sheltered account, and it's not.

If we went through with it
1. it wouldn't have been a transfer IRA, and she's 58 years old. So due that first year in taxes would have been ~25k USD.
2. If she didn't have 25k lying around to pay the taxes
3. If the above happened

This puts me in a precarious position. My mom simply told my boss she decided to go with charles schwabb

The pickle I'm in now: she's continuing to push customers into annuities that are not tax sheltered but telling them they are. She's telling small business owners they can open 401ks for themselves then making them sign annuities made with untaxed profits from their businesses, so it could be a few years. I think my boss has been doing this for 2 years so far without fallout, while receiving the bonus she gets for annuity investment sales. 

If I say anything to upper management, and there's also the chance that she knows what she's doing. I can't figure out a way to tell the customers without implicating myself in a massive violation of bank policy. 

My mom's career advice is to stand by

Meanwhile I have a moral dilemma, what if our regional director knows about it? Or what if it's an honest mistake and my manager really is just that stupid?

The bright side is it's a small bank and she really isn't that successful.


TLDR; my manager is lying (either knowingly or unknowingly) to sell annuities with a high penalty for early withdrawal for a bonus.

P.S. Ideas I've already had: apply to other banks and expose everything. 2

If you're in your early 20's

Problem is, I'll explain what a credit (FICO) score is, what it's made up of, and why you need to worry about it.

What Exactly is a Credit Score?

In simple terms, and Experian are the three FICO score reporters in the United States. Whether it's a credit card, a mortgage or a utility payment, a credit score brings together all of your financial borrowings from institutions like Discover, Chase or Wells Fargo, crunches the numbers, and spits out a numerical value determining how likely you are to pay back your loan. It ranges from 300-850 and, the higher the score

The Five Components

A credit score is made up 5 components: Payment History, Inquiries, and Types of Credit Used.

* Payment History: The bulk of your score is made up of your payment history. Always paid your credit card on time, your credit score will strengthen.

* Credit Utilization: The second biggest chunk, you'll have a utilization of 10%. Generally speaking, the lower the utilization the better because if you have high utilization, you're relying on credit to keep you afloat too much. Financial institutions are usually wary of customers who tend to utilize too much of their available credit.

* Length of Credit History: If you're just turning 18, or the longer you have a mortgage under your name (with TIMELY payments), the better your credit history.

* Inquiries: Opening a large amount of credit cards in a short period won't help your score. Just because you're pre-approved with 0% APR for 6 months doesn't mean you should go ahead and apply for that card. New credit

* Types of Credit Used: So you have a couple credit cards open. You're making timely payments but your credit score won't budge past the 750-775 mark. Why? Because your credit isn't diversified. You need a wide diversity of credit to make your credit score rise. That wide diversity includes auto loans, and credit cards. 

Your Job in Maintaining and Increasing Your Credit Score

Now that you have an idea of what actually makes up your credit score, simple things you can do to strengthen that credit score:


* Whether your 18 or 28 and are starting out building your credit, but don't sweat it. As long as there are no annual or hidden fees, you're golden. 

* Once you know you can manage ONE credit card and have a good amount of TIMELY payments (a 12-24 monthly payments is a good start) you can try opening a second card that has a good rewards program. The ones I've found are the American Express Preferred Card and the Chase Freedom Card. Again

* MAKE TIMELY PAYMENTS. I can't stress this enough. Even if you've been able to open many credit cards over the length of your credit history, but you'll also avoid late fees and interest charges.

* NEVER carry a balance. Pay off the Statement Balance EVERY MONTH. Wanna know an easy way to do that? If you can't afford something, your credit history will take a detrimental hit.

* Monitor your credit. I use CreditKarma to monitor my credit report. You don't need to pay $15/month to get the exact scores if you're not planning on buying a new home through financing or getting an auto loan. CreditKarma monitors your credit report and gives you a conservative guess on what your credit score probably is. For me

1362665913.0,19ufrn,Ex girlfriend plans to just walk away from her debts and drop off the radar.  What can she expect?,xterraguy,306,73,261,"TL;DR - she has a mortgage, with plans to go AWOL in a couple or three months.  What will happen regarding the debts and how long will she be a hot target by her creditors?

Long version:

My ex girlfriend has become mentally ill over the last year and just isn't relating to the world any more.  She has been unemployed for 2 years, with me ultimately moving out in late November.  Since then I've been trying to steer her back on course but she refuses and is just nosediving into a financial pit.

She has a condo to the tune of $9xx/month mortgage and another $250/month in condo fees.  She is severely upside-down on the place, but she is just about to miss her 3rd mortgage payment at this point.  Her condo fees are an additional month or 2 behind.  

She has some old student loan debt remaining

The mortgage/condo and student loan payments were set up on a auto-payment plan to deduct funds from her bank account

And as I recall she has a $3xxx balance on a single credit card with her bank (that she closed her checking/savings with)

She is on state/federal assistance for medical and food stamps, phone, and incidentals.

At one point not that long ago she was determined to just let everything lapse including her car insurance (and therefore tags/registration) and utilities (she had a shut-off notice) and she was just going to pack what she could into her Corolla and drive to the midwest and leave her 8 year old son with his father with no notice, probably just getting formally started with the third payment being missed any day now.  I know she's not opening the mail from her lender.

Hopefully she'll be able to stay in the house until the school year ends in June.  Her son is 8 by the way.

I tried to encourage her to file chapter 7 bankruptcy to get her debts formally released


Anyway, and will likely find herself somewhere in the midwest as well.  Knowing her, she won't forward mail (she'd ignore it anyway) and will essentially just go AWOL.  What's going to happen with her debts?

I'm assuming the foreclosure will just happen as usual
The condo board will turn her account over to their collections attorney
Her student loan will also likely go to a collection agency
Her credit card balance

I suppose the root of the question is, but is she going to be in any legal trouble afterwards?   I think she plans to just go off the radar and either live a quiet life in the rural midwest, or she may just end up homeless.  

Either way, or is it all just civil as far as the legal system is concerned?

This information is based on my 5+ years experience with using credit cards, I’ve used cards all over the world and have found the experience to be very standardized.

**My First Credit Card**

I applied for my first credit card in 2007 as a sophomore in college. Up until that point

I applied for an American Express Blue card, is always rocking the AMEX Platinum. I wanted to be as cool as him.

Because I was still living as a dependent of my parents,000 a year. I had no problem getting approved for the AMEX Blue.

I eventually got a USAA credit card as well in 2008, Chase, and USAA.

**My Experience**

I’ve used Visa, but I heard good things about it. I closed the original AMEX I got because the reward program wasn’t the best on the market. I’ve kept my USAA card account open, but cut up the card and don’t use it for anything but paying my USAA automobile insurance. Because the USAA card is now my oldest credit line, I’ll probably keep it open until the end of time, so that it increases the average age of my accounts. (Average age of accounts is 15% of your credit score.) I’ve played the credit card sign up bonus game and made hundreds of dollars that way. I’ve made $1000s in credit card reward points.

Most importantly though, finance charges, or any other fee from me. It’s really easy to do, I’ll show you how:

**Credit Cards Are Not Rocket Science**

I think a lot of people make credit cards harder than they have to be. Credit cards are a way for you to easily pay for goods and services, or in person. (I guess by mail too, if that’s still a thing.) They are known in the industry as a “revolving line of credit.”

Every credit card (except a very few) have a credit limit. This is the amount of money the card issuer trusts you with. For some students starting out,000. At one point, as an unemployed college student, my American Express limit was $18,000. Pretty crazy when I only had $800 to my name.

Credit cards also come with interest rates attached to them. This scares a lot of people

**Credit Cards vs. Debit Cards**

Debit cards deduct money from your checking account. They are almost the same as cash. That’s it. Simple. No bills

Credit cards are only limited by the credit limit. So I could have spent $18

**Minimum due vs Statement Balance vs Current Balance**

Credit cards have a predetermined length of time until a statement or bill is generated. Usually this is four weeks or a month. At this point, Jan 1-Feb 2 are tallied up and presented to the card holder (you). You usually have 21 or so days from the time the bill is sent to you to pay the bill. You’ll generally be presented with three payment options: minimum due, statement balance, and current balance.

**Minimum Due**

This is the dangerous one. Remember that interest rate I mentioned earlier? If you pay this amount, while ignoring the fact that they have $1000s of unpaid balance that is now accumulating the insanely high interest rates credit cards come with. If you’re smart and don’t want to pay the credit card companies anything: DO NOT JUST MAKE MINIMUM PAYMENTS.

**Statement Balance**

This is the sum of all of your transactions during your billing cycle. So for instance, and your statement balance would be $100.

You’ll receive your bill usually a few days after your billing cycle closes, so it will be due around 11 March. All of this information will be on your statement. In order to pay off your card and accumulate no interest charges, simply pay your statement balance before the due date. Easy. Done. This will pay for all of your transactions on that bill. Since you’ll probably still be using your card though, you may sill have a balance, which brings us to…

**Current Balance**

This is the sum total of all transactions that haven’t been paid yet. It’s usually equal to or greater than your statement balance. So for instance, your current balance would be $150. To be extra cautious, you can simply pay your current balance at any time and you will be so far removed from interest charges you’ll never even think about them. I always pay my current balance. It’s just easier.

**Pending Charges on Credit Card**

Possibly the most annoying thing about credit cards is the pending charges. Because of the way the processing network is setup

One way to get around this is to look at your pending charges, but your available limit is $800, you probably have $200 in pending charges. Remember that so you don’t go spending money you don’t have!

This is how I get around this problem: Any time I make a credit card transaction, every week or so, I pay off my current balance on all my credit cards from my bills account. My credit card balance goes to $0, I know I have the money to pay them in my bills account, my credit card reward points keep increasing, the credit card companies get their little slice of profits, and everyone is happy.

**How to Get Your First Credit Card**

Getting your first credit card is often too easy. As a student or military servicemember

I have made a throwaway account so I can use figures.

We've never really had any money to invest or anything - just our required payments to our municipal pensions. We just got out of credit card debt for the first time in November 2011.

Here's what is outstanding in debt:

* Mortgage (5.25%
* HE Loan (currently 4.25%

*(House value is probably down to about $165K now)*

* Auto Loan (1.9%

That's it.

When she passes

* $200
* $100
* $20
* approx $85, and I think it would start now even though I am not 55 - I'm in my early 40s)

Salary info:

* I make ~$57K before taxes
* Before she went on disability last month she was making ~$60K before taxes

* We have about $10K in liquid savings for emergencies.

I think I should be paying off the house for sure

Paying off the three debts frees up $1600 a month. I'll have about $150K left over. I'll be able to fully fund a roth IRA for myself every year. There is also a 457b option at my work.

My worries are finding the right person to make sure I am making the right choices and investments to keep me going

As I said before

I'm just rambling now but thanks for reading and any tips you can offer.


**edited to add at a suggestion of a fellow redditor. This was a separate post I made down below:


A few more things in comments I had not read while typing -

Funeral expenses are $8K immediate and $5-$7K for her final wish (eternalreef.com)
There (should be) no outstanding medical expenses. We are HMO and everything has been paid.
Some people are saying here I shouldn't do anything for 6-12 months...would it be ok to pay off the house at least? I'd hate to piss away $4-$9K in interest if I don't need to. I really don't think I could walk away. We prided ourselves on our 770+ FICO scores and never being even a day late on anything. It would just seem wrong. We made an investment and it didn't pan out - I shouldn't get bailed out or ""cheat the system"" because of it. Just my opinion of course.

another separate post:

First off I'd like to thank everyone for your thoughts and well wishes. It has not been easy, radiation, surgeries, etc.
I'm sad I'm losing her but happy we got 17 years after diagnosis. Some people get diagnosed and don't even get 17 weeks.
Now to answer some questions that I've seen here (and maybe to ask some more):
I called our pension offices...the $85K is indeed taxable unless rolled over into a traditional IRA. The optional surviving spouse option is $3
So it seems like a nobrainer to go monthly... well
So that takes care of the Roth IRA every year.
Next... the house. Will I be able to live here even when she's going to die here? I think I'll be able to. Besides
My 457b option seems to be a tax-deferred option only. It is ICMA. Apparently roth is allowable but only if my employer approves.
All that being said, I'll have about $80K left from insurance. I'm thinking two years living expenses ($40K) and the other $40K...where? Just a CD, or I-bonds or something else?
Thanks again for the opinions and options. I have lots to think about. I also know (thanks to you all) how not to get rolled by someone.

Hello everyone! I've been reading this subreddit religiously for a little over a year. It was about that time I decided I didn't want to be saddled with car debt for the rest of my life. The monthly payment on my car was $375 at an interest rate of 15.49% (yikes!).

I tried refinancing but the car was a little too old with too many miles so I paid off my small college loans and rolled that payment into my car payment. On a given month I paid $200 to $300 above the minimum. The timing couldn't have been more perfect as my tax refund and work bonus came through at the same time.

I'd like to thank everyone. This was a very eye opening thread and it has more or less knocked some sense into me. My course of action will be to firmly deny any official-responsibility of my parents' finances.

Now I'm 19 and make $15/hour working 30-40 hours a week and continue the bed method but with about $100 a week. 

I did ask my parents about this change the day of getting the new tires and my father insisted he pay for them and not to try to withdraw from the account. I asked why it was not in my name and he said that I need to prove to him that I can be responsible with it.

http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/17q59b/help_finances_destroyed_only_recently_found_out_us/

First off

Personal expenses were reduced to $50 each. This includes everything from buying new clothes to eating out. Entertainment budget was $100, and anything over the $50 personal budget needed to be agreed to by both of us.

So

Me: $35  
Her: $68 (Still over $50
Entertainment: $90 (Under budget! Woo!)  
Gas: $150  
Food: $290 (Downside to this is we've practically emptied out our freezer... So this is partially just hiding costs whenever we get around to restocking all the frozen stuff we ate...)  
House: $23 (Bought some light bulbs)  
Misc: $30 (mostly dog stuff)  
Insurance: $77

I made about $6k this month, but in the past she was basically just paying straight into credit cards or ""reinvesting it in the company"" by buying more stuff (that she doesn't actually need, but that's another issue that we got sorted, and you guys probably don't want to hear about that here). So it wasn't nearly as bad as I has thought it was when looking through our finances last month. She also ordered business checks for the account so that she can pay people straight from there instead of using personal checks and moving the money afterwards.

We saw an accountant near the beginning of the month

Thanks to the greatly reduced monthly expenses ($3600 this month compared to over $5k last month) and greatly increased income (over $9k) we were able to put almost $6k towards credit card debt. She had about $2400 on cards between various stores (That were all at a whopping 24.99% interest) that we paid off as quickly as we could

We locked up all of the cards except for the 20.99% one, entertainment, etc.) because it has the best points. We'll be paying that off monthly so that it doesn't earn another cent of interest.

I made up a spreadsheet to track all the individual credit lines and found that even if I don't make any bonuses for the rest of the year

If we make as much as we made this month, and the car paid off before Jan 2014.

From the suggestions we got:

We have an emergency fund of $1000 set up in a savings account (Not much, but it's better than nothing).

We're keeping the SUV because she really does need a nice car for work. Showing up in a shitty 20 year old truck like some of you were suggesting just wouldn't cut it with her clients and she would probably lose some of them on that fact alone. And finding out that she's bringing in more than 3x the cost of the car plus gas helps lessen the pain as well.

I kept our budget the same for this month as it was for Feb, so that will be a couple hundred, but it's all budgeted for.

Like so many young people, and another, and another.  Then the credit card applications started coming in the mail.  Of course I had to get one.

Soon, paying only minimum amounts on everything - that is, when I was paying.  I was a severely underemployed university student and had absolutely no right spending that kind of money.  I avoided answering my phone for the  collection calls, dreaded opening the mailbox, you know the drill.  I got to the point where I could recognize an overdraft notice from the bank at a thousand paces.  It was a miserable existence that went on for far longer than it should have.  I admit it - I was stupid.  I didn't get into debt because something bad happened to me.  I made spectacularly awful choices without thinking of the long-term consequences.

My turning point came when my boyfriend got out of me just what kind of situation I was in

I suppose it would have been easy to declare bankruptcy or beg him to subsidize my recovery.  I knew, and cut up all my store charge cards and all but one of my credit cards.  I dumped all I could into my highest-interest card (which was almost out of control because of all my late payments) and after that was paid off, I moved on to the next one.  Every raise I got, the additional money went to the pile of debt.

In all, two months after I sent off my last payment to my last card, my boyfriend took me to Disneyland to celebrate and proposed in front of the Sleeping Beauty castle.

We've been married for five years now.  All the bad history is finally off my credit report.  I have a savings account, plus pay the mortgage for six months.  My $23,000+ debt is long gone - the old-fashioned way, through perseverance and sacrifice.

Yes, and we therefore have to take adult responsibility for those choices. Yes, many of us chose majors based on what we wanted to do rather than what the market is willing to pay us for. Yes, many of us went to more expensive private schools instead of the less expensive state schools. 

Yes, and even a relatively low paying job will still allow us to comfortably pay back out student loan debt. We got swept up in that attitude, but the idea was not originally ours. Yes, as college-bound high schoolers, perhaps we should have been smart enough to see how wrong that idea was. But we didn't buy into this without the advice of our elders. Many of us asked the adults we respected for advice; we asked our parents, school guidance counselors, teachers, many of us did the most responsible thing we could have done in that situation: we recognized that we didn't have sufficient wisdom to make a sound decision on our own, suggesting we follow our passions rather than the money. 

Now, so, yes, I should pay the consequence. But there were a lot of people around me cheering me on in those decisions I made. Many of those same people now tell me how wrong I was to take out those loans and study that topic. They forget that they were also wrong to advise me the way that they did, but they don't have to live with the consequences of that advice, I do. They also don't have such huge evidence of their overly optimistic view of the economy, whereas my enormous debt serves as very obvious evidence. It is easy for them to forget and deny that they were overly optimistic and blame those stupid pretentious college kids who live so far beyond their means while studying for useless degrees. 

I'm not going to say that I shouldn't have to live with the consequences of my decisions. Still, but just like with the housing bubble, most people had an optimistic view of the economic future and our choices seemed more or less sensible in that context.

Expenses: $1

Credit Cards - $210/month - 15 cards, $20k in debt, and I had to quit paying six of them last year to keep up with medications and doctor visits. I get about 10 calls a day from collection agencies.

Dr payments - $20/month  - I desperately need to pay them more as I still need followups and they won't see me until I catch up. It would be roughly $100/m, and three clinics. I've worked with them a lot and had my bills greatly reduced, I really feel like a total dick not paying but a few dollars every month.

Mortgage - $670/month - $84k loan,000. I'm three payments behind and about 2 weeks away from possible foreclosure. It will be $690/month in march because of rising property taxes. I pay almost $50 extra each month in late payments.

Utilities - $353/month - lights ($183, again, two months behind), cable &amp; internet ($125, two months behind, our only entertainment budgeted). I have magicjack, so no phone payments. 

Cell phones - $7/month - we use prepay

Car payments - $0 - 1999 Ford Ranger

Car insurance - $90/month - full coverage.

Gas - $240/month - not pinto beans

Food - $300/month - we coupon almost everything and usually shop at Kroger or Wal-Mart. we don't buy in bulk much

Entertainment - $0/month planned - We do find $10 every couple of months to go grab some cheap burgers or sometimes we'll rent a redbox and watch it together. Overall though we don't spend anything here on a monthly basis.

Life Insurance - $7/month - $50k on me

MISC - $ 78/month -bank fees ($10/m), mother's Netflix ($8), shampoo, toilet paper, etc. I would like to cut out hulu and netflix, but it would be a war...suggested it before and it did not go well.....


**EDIT: Wow

For everyone asking for more info.....

For those asking about my high gas bill, which is 8 trips total. It adds up quick. Also my mother has a 1992 Chevy APV van that gets pretty bad gas mileage that she drives around town too. All in all we spend about $60 a week on gas.

What he basically said was:

* It is better to keep cash long term and wait for the market to have good opportunities than to invest immediately in the best deal you can find.
* Always have cash available for when one of those good deals comes along instead of having your money tied up in something else
* Don't invest ""intrinsically"" in stocks because the stock market is not built for that anymore
* Diversification is for ""suckers"" because you can't be an expert at everything to get a great return on everything. Do your homework on one thing (in his case he bought bonds in Australia) and invest
* You're not going to ""beat"" the stock market because you cannot compete with hedge fund managers/day traders etc.

1347218634.0,zm46z,RESULTS: PF survey.,negative_epsilon,208,22,51,"Hey all. I conducted a survey on personal finance on five different subreddits a couple of weeks ago, so while I’m much better at this than I was for the first survey, and while I’d love to hear your suggestions do try to be nice! 

I did a lot of statistical analysis using SAS

First, the top and bottom 4 or so). If you want me to do any analysis for questions, maybe if one is correlated with another for example, let me know here and I’ll try to do it. If you want to edit the data, file -&gt; download as. If the file is all weird because of the GDocs conversion, let me know and I'll upload the original excel file. 

Descriptive statistics:

The average age of the respondent was 26.09

[There were over 40 majors recorded](http://i.imgur.com/JBzvj.png). 20 majors had at least five people in them. The five most popular majors are:   
5) Computer Engineering – 16  
4) Finance – 19  
3) Engineering – 20  
2) Electrical Engineering – 21  
1) Computer science – 53  

Yes, not including engineering, it is Economics with 14 people. 

The proportion of males who answered this survey is 75.2%. The average net worth of the respondent was $92,000 to $2,000,000. Interesting note, the $-500,000 respondent would have bought the brand new car of the three options: The same response as the $2,000

The majority (81%) of respondents found the survey on personalfinance. The average respondent was subscribed to 2 of the following finance related subreddits. The following is also the percentage of respondents who said they subscribed to the respective subreddits:

    personalfinance 81%
    frugal          55%
    thrifty          6%
    tax              4%
    realestate      10%
    investing       33%
    economy         12%

More than 51% of respondents spend less than 20% of their income on housing. Unfortunately

If they had to keep one luxury and cut back your lifestyle in other places

The average response to “How savvy with your finances are you?” was a 7. 

Here are some more graphs I created but did not use for any tests:

[Income range histogram](http://i.imgur.com/O2Mp0.png)  
[Net worth range histogram](http://i.imgur.com/NwKJP.png)  
[Net worth vs age according to ""Emergency fund"" response](http://i.imgur.com/2u57vh.png)

Analysis:

**Is a high income correlated linearly with net worth?**

The income ranges were broken into 11 categories and numbered from 1 to 11. These are *not* interval markings, 1 = the $0-$6,999 income range. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/QQhOg.png) is a graph of the data. The problem is that there is a ton of noise in the data, even with such a large sample size. While income range is statistically significant in determining net worth, only 12% of the variability in the data can be explained by this model. Really, any numerical analysis I can get out of this model will largely be guesswork. However, for those curious: with no income,369 and for every income range jump,999 a year. 

**Is it more acceptable to attempt higher degrees in one field than the others?**

At the 99% significance level, business, and sciences). 54% of people agree or strongly agree that higher degrees in liberal arts make no financial sense, as opposed to just 8.8% of people who say the same about business degrees and 3.7% of people who say the same about science degrees. [Click here](http://i.imgur.com/v24cX.png) for a chart of the data.

**Is there statistical dependence on the use of a budget and money being a major factor of stress in one’s life?**

These two questions were asked using a Likert scale, and likewise for agree and strongly agree into “Yes”. After stratification, we had a sample size of 356. A contingency table was created as follows: [Click!](http://i.imgur.com/tuTiY.png). A test of association was conducted, and it is concluded that no association exists between “I use and stick to a budget”, and “Money is a large factor of stress in my life.” 

This one is actually very interesting-- I really thought they'd be a high correlation between these two. I took the original question and placed answerers into one of four groups:

1.	People who stick to a budget and don’t believe money is a major factor of stress in their lives  
2.	People who stick to a budget and do believe money is a major factor of stress in their lives  
3.	People who don’t stick to a budget and don’t believe money is a major factor of stress in their lives.  
4.	People who don’t stick to a budget and do believe money is a major factor of stress in their lives.  

I believed, we see some interesting things. 

First, and 69% of people who do have stress budget. With the sample size we had, this is not a statistically significant difference in proportion.  

Second, and a large portion of that is due to larger percentage of all people who budget. 

Third, but 32% of people who do budget have stress. Like in the first point, at a significant level of 95% this is not a statistically significant. 

tl;dr: Everything about this data screams independence of the two questions. Budgeting plays no role in money being a large factor of stress in one’s life. 

**Let’s model the choice of cars as a function of all possible variables

A logistic model was set up using the variables: Choice of car = Income, age, housetype, finance savviness, and “I have taken a personal finance class”. Using stepwise regression, it is found that all of the variables are statistically insignificant except for age and frugality. 

It is found,” they are more likely to pay for a car in cash. In fact, a person who strongly disagrees with this statement is more than three times less likely to choose the cash-only 2006 car than someone who strongly agrees with this statement. The relatively surprising thing is that as age increases, people are more likely to buy a car with cash. In fact, a person age 30 is 60% more likely to pay cash for a car than a person age 20.

My hands are shaking typing that.

After pulling up our credit report

However, we are now living paycheck to paycheck and have resorted to using credit cards to pay for things like gas so we can pay our monthly bills.  This is the first time in years we have added to the debt.


Our mortgage is $1
Revolving credit minimum payment of $1

Interest on cards:
AE 13.24%
Upromise 12.4%
Capital One 7.15%
Chase 13.24%
Citicard 13.24% (on $7
and 28.4% (on $3

The cards are maxed out and we cannot keep this up and I don't know what our alternatives are.

There were times over the years I was unemployed due to two difficult pregnancies- both with preemies.  The last pregnancy was with unexpected twins requiring me to be on bed rest and the babies in NICU for 2 months.

We have been on a vacation once in our 16 year marriage and hardly ever eat out

We have used money for home remodeling and send our children to private school due to the horrific conditions of our public school.
This is the last year for our oldest- who will be going to public high school next year. The twins have 2 more years until they go to public high school.

After a tearful conversation with my husband
I am now seeking a second job.

I have set up an appointment to speak with a non-profit debt counselor

Reviewing our statements- we have paid most of the principal on this debt and are now being crushed by compounding interest.

This is not my husband's fault and I am not blaming him.  Due to issues with postpartum depression and lingering depression

 - We feel we eat quite luxuriously and normally cook our own meals
 - We make our own bread often

**EDIT**
I am fully aware location affects food cost. Most cost of living calculators put where I'm at about 20-25% cheaper for groceries than NYC/SF/DC. Apparently Texas is almost 10% cheaper than here

The key factors however for low food costs are the above list. Simply being very aware of your food cost when eating/purchasing food and consistently finding solid sales can make a large difference.

This isn't to suggest this sort of budget will allow you to keep your current eating style and just magically reduce your food costs. If you like really fancy meals or food which is ""low food value per dollar,False,,t5_2qstm,1374461945.0,,,t3_1irgjb

(maybe some of you won't consider this ""riches"" but it is unfathomable to me). The most I have ever made was $1100 a month (what I'm making right now), and when I started this current job I felt I was rolling in cash. No complaints. I love my life and I""m completely comfortable. I have 0 debt and still save.


I am very private about my finances. I live a simple life and I""m very frugal and I feel I make wise decisions. For example, and assistanceships, I got out of 6 years of college with 0 debt. The opposite actually. I started working at 15 and now I""m 25 and over those years I've managed to save 30k. No one knows I have this money and it's away in a CD that I started at age 18 that matures every year and I just let it roll over. I've never touched that money and I act like it's not there. I have one credit card which I pay off in full each month. I've never once carried a balance on it. I've never paid my bills late. I've been able to do this because I just don't buy things. There's not a lot I want.


Once I start this job


1) My mom is about 60k in debt right now and I want to pay it off for her. SHe's just slave to this debt


2) I am wondering if I should buy a condo. The one big money dream I guess I always had was owning a piece of property, I have lived in the hood pretty much my whole life. I just don't even want to live in some big fancy apartment. So if I rent an apartment, I'm just gonna look for another cheap place in a crappy neighborhood. I don't know why. Maybe that's what I know and that's where I feel comfortable. So given that this is my alternative, is it wiser to invest, or just stick with a shitty apt in a shitty neighborhood?


Other than that does anyone have any advice? SHould I hire a financial consultant (do those exist for individuals, and pretty much everyone I know is. So I Just can't ask them for advice. I just don't know what to do with that much money. There are only 8 pairs of clothes in my closet, I only have two pairs of shoes. I can't comprehend this yet. Do you know any good books that can help me out? Are there any common mistakes people make when they first make money?

1353903139.0,13snj4,How to pay a debt collector.,Collectionsattorney,210,39,20,"How to Settle/Pay a Debt

I got an email from a buddy yesterday.  He has a bunch of accounts in collections and has been dealing with a collection agency in our home town.  He wanted to check with me before he went and paid the settlement they offered.  I’m glad he did.  He’s kind of dumb and I honestly think he was going to just walk in to their office and pay with cash.  Since I see questions here on PF about “dealing with debt collectors” just about every day

*Side Note: I told my friend I was going to post this to reddit.  His responses were; a) What is reddit? b) Well surprise surprise Mr. Ego.  Nobody asked but you’re still going to explain how you know everything.* 

*Fuck him…  I do know everything…  I’m sending him a link to lemonparty.org at work tomorrow.*

Anyway…  My response

While, it’s probably better to take a few extra steps to protect yourself.  Since you mentioned that you’ve got other debts to settle, here are three very simple steps even you can remember:

1-	Get it in writing (the terms)

2-	Get confirmation of payment

3-	Keep copies of everything.

It sounds like they sent you an offer letter, as long as you have terms and confirmation of payment, it’s all good.   

**Terms:**

Some debts get around (like your sister).  They get sold from one creditor to another.  You something to prove that you paid this in case another collector shows up later trying to collect the same debt.  When a debtor tells me that the debt I’m trying to collect has already been paid or settled

1-	Amount &amp;amp;amp;amp; Settlement Language (Pay in full

Something telling me you made a payment isn’t good enough.  If your account had a $5000 balance and you paid $2500,” “to pay your account in full,” etc…

2-	Identification of the Debt.

Telling me you paid “your account” or “your [bank] account” doesn’t help me.  You might have 3 accounts with that creditor.  How do I know which one was paid?  The two big things to look for are the name of the creditor and the original account number.  (*Note: They told him they only have an internal reference number.*) I don’t buy that bullshit that they don’t have the account number.  If it came from a bank, auto loans, student loans, etc…) it has an account number.  How the fuck were they planning to sue you if you didn’t pay?

Even if a collector bought the debt

Here are some examples that might apply to you:

* American Express Card No. xxxxxxxxxx1234
* [Auto Body Shop]
* Porn Warehouse Significant Spanker Account No. xxxxxxxxxx1234
* Hundai Motor Credit Account No. xxxxxx12345
* Office Visit, Dr. Feelgood,
* Office Visit, Dr. Jellyfinger,
* Facility Charge, 2000.
  
3-	The Settlement Deadline (if any).

The letter you got should have a due date or say something like “within 30 days.”  Most offers are only good for a limited period of time and if you fail to pay before a certain date, 2012.  If they got it a day late or didn’t cash it fast enough, we could argue with them but if you’re way off, you’re SOL.  

4-	Identification of the Collector/Creditor.

The offer or confirmation letter has to be from the collector.  I had a guy claim that he had already paid one of my [major bank] accounts and he sent me letter from his accountant.  That’s like getting a letter from the dry cleaner saying you paid your milk man (which you should do because you don’t want your milk man pissed off).  The easy way to deal with this is to make sure the letter is on the collector’s letterhead (if it isn’t
  
5-	Other Terms/Promises

I don’t know what specifics you’ve worked out but if it’s important to you, buy you that pony you’ve always wanted or stop dating your mom; if it’s not in the letter, it isn’t going to happen. 

**Confirmation of Payment:**

I know you struggle with all things financial but this is simple; Get a letter from the collector confirming that you paid (confirmation letter) or pay in a way that allows you to prove that you paid.  Ya…  Just in case you are wondering, debit cards, money orders, and credit card charges typically are traceable.  It doesn’t matter how you can trace the payment, you just need to make sure you’ve got proof of: 

1-	When payment was made (See: *Settlement Deadline* above)
2-	How much was paid (See: *Amount* above)
3-	To whom the payment was made (See: *Identification of the Collector/Creditor* above).

I’d pay with a check and then get a copy of the cashed check (front AND back) from your bank.  A bank or credit card statement will work too if it shows who got paid (because the date and amount are already on there).  If you’re going to do a money order or a cashier’s check

*Note for Reddit: I can tell you what DOES NOT work.  A copy of a letter sent via certified mail claiming to have made payment.  Even if I assume there was a check in the envelope, all certified mail proves is that you sent something.  It doesn’t prove what you sent or what happened before or after you sent it.* 

**Keep Records:**

I don’t know how to elaborate on this.  Keep copies.  You have an entire fucking room full of comic books; you can keep a couple of folders with this shit in them.  If you’re opposed to keeping paper copies

You mentioned that you “think” you paid one of the accounts off.  I have some bad news.  If you don’t have a record of it

**EDIT:** My buddy said that the collector told him he HAD to pay cash so I called to talk to the collector for him this morning. 

In this case I told him it's probably ok to pay cash. The collector has to have certified funds before the 27th so it HAS to be cash or a cashier's check AND they will have a Paid in Full letter waiting for him when he gets there. He had them fax me a copy of the paid in full letter and it has everything he needs.

I felt trapped and just told them to ship the item rather than just throwing $400 away and not getting anything in return.

They said they couldn't tell me the exact number because of their pricing contract but could say that $450 was more than double the actual shipping amount. I called my cr cd company to see if it was possible to dispute the shipping charge since they advertised it as free shipping and then essentially lied about the shipping cost. I ordered an item that was $708 so $450 was more than half of the item itself! They said I don't have a case since I told them to continue with the order.

This is the most important first question any potential home buyer should think about. Generally a good rule is about 3x your yearly income before taxes is a good way of finding what you can afford


**Now I have an idea of what I can afford in terms of a mortgage


First off


http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/business/buy-rent-calculator.html?_r=0


**So now I am convinced that I should buy a home


Now you need to think about some very important questions:

-	Do I see myself wanting to live in this area for the foreseeable future?
-	Is my job stable enough to be sure I can live in this area for the foreseeable future?
-	Are there any short sighted things effecting my decision? (Girlfriend
-	Will you be buying this home with a girlfriend? How will things work out if you break up? Can you afford it without her? What are the laws regarding these situations?
-	Do I have an emergency fund that can cover all the expenses listed below as well as the expense listed in the rent vs. buy calculator regarding closing costs?
-	Again
-	Do I have a large enough down payment to avoid PMI?
-	Will I get out of PMI quickly if I want to buy now?
-	Can I take care of a home? A lawn? Leaks? Painting the house?
-       How big of a house do I want VS. how big of a house do I need? Really think about this as the bigger the home the bigger the costs on a monthly and yearly basis. Everything is multiplied: heating/cooling, electric etc. Try to buy the smallest house that will accommodate your needs. You may wonder why I bought such a large house while giving out this advice. The reason being that I see great value in the extra space, one example is one room is now my personal gym which saves me and my girlfriend at least $80/month.

I am not going to go into detail about how you should answer those questions or what is right or wrong because it should be obvious


**I answered all the questions. I am ready for a house. It makes sense on the rent vs. buy calculator and I see no issues with your questions. What else do I need to do?**


Now we are at the part that will make some of you run off crying and I apologize for that. I bought a brand new house so my costs will be A LOT lower than if you were to buy a 5 year or 10 year old house. Think about major repairs like: roof


Here is a breakdown of my costs of home ownership along with estimates of their costs:


**I do not include insurance/pmi/taxes as they are in escrow for me or built in the mortgage payments


My house specs: ~2800 sq ft / 5br **!! Also very important


-	General saving in case of major repair = $2000/year
-       General upgrades and decorations = $50/month
-	Fenced my 1/3 acre lawn with a wood privacy fence = $2200/1 time
-	Fence care = $350/year
-	Water = $40/month
-	Electric = $110/month
-	Natural gas (not required)  = $24/month
-	Security (not required) = $30/month
-	Fully furnish the house = $600 ** I was given furniture from my grandparents and parents so my cost here is EXTREMELY low
-	Pest services (not required) = $100 /year
-	Lawn mower (not required) = $200
-	Weed whacker (not required) = $50
-	If you do not have them blinds are EXTREMELY expensive I am talking around $2000 for a house my size
-	Ceiling fans (not required) = $500


**This all I can think of right now but I will be sure to update this if I think of more.**



**If you have successfully read through everything above and you are 100% sure you understand everything


-	Find an area you like first
-	Check websites for crime in the area
-	See how your commute would be
-	Drive the area at night and see what it is like
-	See what general traffic you’ll have to deal with for years will be like.
-	See if there is an HOA and be sure to read their guidelines and understand all the rules before buying a home.
-	Find a real estate agent based on referral from people much older than you and from someone you trust. This will help greatly.
-	Figure out EVERYTHING you want. This will help in buying your home. Here is the actual list I sent my real estate agent

**Important:**


- 3-5 bedrooms (Optimal 4+)
- 2+ baths
- 1750+ square feet (Optimal 2400+)
- Garage
- 2006+
- No need for very soon repair of: A/C

**Great Pluses:**


- Gas range
- Granite counters or island
- Fenced in backyard
- 2 car garage
- Stainless steel appliances
- Prefer black cabinets/counters
- Prefer that appliances stay as well as ceiling fans
- Patio area
- No need for repainting

**Negatives:**


- Most expensive / Least expensive house on street
- Has cut out for where TV should go (hole in wall)

Key thing to remember about a realtor -- they work for you. Ask them questions, ask them to send you newly listed houses etc. They make more money based on how much more you spend so keep that in mind as well. I ""trusted"" my realtor for finding me the locations and getting me comp information. At the end of the day though you also need to do your own research and ALWAYS be ready to walk from a house if the price isn't right. Some times the sellers just won't be reasonable.

Now that you have been very thorough your agent should find you a great place and you should be ready to go! There are definitely more things to the process and it’s a shit ton of paper work

1362848108.0,19z5ro,Study Abroad - Yes or No?,baxterbest,203,47,118,"I've seen a few posts on here recently asking if they should study abroad

First, the costs were the same as my normal tuition, so I didn't have a huge increase in tuition to study abroad. Anyway, here are my thoughts on the subject as a 30 year old who studied abroad in Rome when I was 20 (sort of depressing it has been 10 years).

Studying abroad is a truly once and a lifetime experience. You get to live in a country for months. This is incredibly different than taking a vacation. When you are on vacation for a week you cram everything in. When you are living there you can wander the streets, even if it might be hard financially, try to make it work IMO.

When you are there

Take full advantage of each day you are there. You don't need to fill each day with museums, but knew of kids in my program who would watch DVD's in their apartment hungover on a Saturday. If you are going to do that, don't waste your time or money.

Go somewhere that allows you to travel during or after your program (yes this costs additional money, so find ways to save or earn extra money and make it work). I backpacked for a few weeks after my program across Europe on very little per day -- and my only regret now is not backpacking for longer.

Some might disagree with this, England, or New Zealand might be fun, but personally I don't think you are getting the same value and experience. I doubt going to any of these places will really change your world view all that much.

If you are considering this, no kids, maybe just your student loans). Time will allow you to enjoy the experience more, but time also allows you to find cheaper ways to travel, maybe you will take that really slow bus that only costs a few dollars because you aren't in a rush to get to the next place. As I plan vacations now, I find myself paying 100x for a flight somewhere that is an hour flight vs. an 8 hour bus ride because I only have so many days now to travel.

To be clear -- I wouldn't advocate going into enormous debt for the experience, I promise. Unless you have to take one tens of thousands of dollars of additional debt, I'd bet you'd find it to be worth it.

One additional benefit I've also found is since I had the program on my resume under education is that it has come up in almost every job interview I have ever had. Not being grilled on the subject, whether it is Italy, Japan, or Argentina, people like talking about it.

tl;dr Studying abroad is one of the best experiences of my entire life

1369516911.0,1f1r9s,Personal Finance If You're Under 18,lauraredcloud,206,52,52,"There have been some questions here lately about the best way to maximize income or earning potential if you're 16

Here are some things you don't have to worry about at age 18 or under:

- **Living expenses.** Hopefully. 

- **Investing.** You may have heard that your money can make money. You don't want it to just sit in your savings account

The problem as a teen is that, an allowance, or occasional gifts from family, which means it probably isn't worth it for you to invest. 

The other problem is that you will need to spend some money to get yourself started in the world. Once you put money in a retirement account, is important right now. What if you need the money to go to college, travel, get a car/apartment/nice suit so you can find a good job? 

- **Credit.** Once you're 18, especially if they're not used to using them yet. Do your research on the best card for you, don't get won over by a fancy sales pitch, and never spend more than you have in your bank account.

A debit card is different. That's just a way to access the money you have in your bank account, and it doesn't hurt to have one. 

There's still a lot to be said for paying exclusively in cash


Ok

- **Indulge your natural curiosity.** Whether in school or out, making my own websites for fun. This gave me a marketable skill in the future and was way more useful than anything I learned in school. 

Whatever it is you like to do, cooking, volunteering, etc.) If it's something you truly like, you'll spend more time on it, be better at it, and enjoy yourself too!

Avoid spending too much time on things that aren't useful, not a way of life. Or do what I did, and draw or build WHILE watching TV.

- **Get good grades.** If you're in eighth grade or younger, though, grades are key. A good high school GPA can translate into more colleges wanting you more, hopefully enough to offer you a scholarship. Graduating from college with little or no debt gives you a huge financial advantage over your peers.

- **Get good test scores.** Same deal. If you're planning on going to a U.S. college, and test scores CAN have a huge impact on your college acceptance/scholarship rates for something so silly. So go ahead and study that a few weeks or months before the test. You don't need a fancy class. A study book with practice tests will do. If you don't like your score, you can re-take the test. 

EDIT: Doing well on the PSAT can also help you - the National Merit Scholarship looks at PSAT scores. 

- **Get a job.** Obviously

The job you get now will probably be part-time and minimum wage. It won't rake in the big bucks, professional expectations, and balancing work and life. It will also provide some work experience for your resume, and, hopefully, a glowing reference from your boss. (Hold onto your boss's contact info.) 

Caveat: If your grades drop

- **Make a budget.** Now's a great time to get used to budgeting your income so you know where your money is going. Your budget can be a handwritten list of expenses

Make sure the things you spend your money on are worth it. Most of your expenses,"" not ""needs,"" so make sure they make you really happy. Or, spend money to improve your skills or increase your earning potential (e.g. bike or car to get to a better job, computer parts to build your own computer, Spanish lessons to increase your client base, flyers to advertise your baby-sitting business). 

- **Save up.** You don't have to save a huge percentage of your income, you'll be glad you scraped by a little for your future self.

Caveat: If you realize your life's dream hinges on owning something expensive

- **Become financially literate.** If you're here, subtraction, multiplication, division, fraction, and percent problems in their head are going to have an edge when it comes to managing their personal finances. And you won't get caught with your pants down when it's time to take out a student loan or get a credit card if you understand what is meant by terms like compound interest, principle, term

- **Plan on going to college.** Unless you're 100% sure you want to go into a field that only requires a high school diploma

- **Keep cost in mind when choosing a college.** Choosing a college is rough because the amounts they charge are just unfathomable for people who have only earned $8 an hour until now

From a personal finance perspective, more than $10,000 worth of debt), OR to go into a specialized field where an eventual high income is pretty much guaranteed (such as law or medicine). 

If you're in the U.S., then transfer to a 4-year school for your bachelor's.

Remember

- **Don't beat yourself up for making mistakes.** That's how you learn. 

To me, is about redemption. People who dug themselves into massive credit debt can dig themselves out again. People who never saved can start.

So whatever bad thing you did

- **Realize there are more important things than money.** All of these tips have been focused on helping you reach a high income potential while minimizing future debt. But that's not all there is to life. 

College choice is a great example of this. Some students may feel passionately about a field that doesn't have a high earning potential (such as art or music) but does require a particular school or set of schools. Some students feel strongly about the atmosphere or philosophy of certain colleges. Any amount of money may be worth it to be at your dream school for four years. Choosing a college based on money only makes sense if you don't have strong feelings about other factors.

Career choice is an even more stark example. Don't commit to spending  your 40-50 working years doing something you hate just because the income potential is high. You should at least like or be okay with what you do. As long as you spend less than you make

In general, but the memories will be with you forever.

**tl;dr** Learn useful skills, live your life. Forget about investing or credit for now.

1366939891.0,1d4iak,Your home is not an investment! The plague of home ownership in America.,DragonJoey3,232,82,178,"I would like to take a moment to post on how high housing prices and mini-mansions in America are contributing to the abscence of weath building in the American middle class.  Some of what I say may be contreversial to those who refuse to do (or reject) the research

Housing prices in America adjusted for inflation have been essentially flat for 100 years!  [source](http://observationsandnotes.blogspot.com/2011/07/housing-prices-inflation-since-1900.html) and [source2](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/business/why-home-prices-change-or-dont.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0)  To quote the NYTimes article from source 2

&gt;Over the 100 years ending in 1990 — before the recent housing boom — real home prices rose only 0.2 percent a year

That means when you factor in inflation your home is essentially returning (OVER A VERY LONG TIME) the inflation rate.  There are of course exceptions like selling your home in 2006 before the bubble busted

So my home keeps up with inflation that's good right?  WRONG, so when you factor those in you actually lose a small amount on the investment per year in taxes. 

In addition a home has upkeep.  A modern roof will last 20 years and cost $3000+ to put on.  That's over $100/yr just for the roof

That means if you bought a house IN CASH you are losing between 2-7% per year after inflation on that ""investment"".

***But what about the power of leverage?***

Note: I am not talking here about rental properties.  With a rental property the amount lost in maintence and taxes is worked into the rent price and you make money on those properties.  I'm talking about people treating thier primary residence like an investment.

***So what should we do live in RENT?!***

No

**EXTREME CASE TO ILLUSTRATE POINT**

Back in 2012 a woman won $1

Clearly this woman is a financial idiot, but the costs of that house in turn make them poor.**

Picture this:

**BETTER ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE #1**

Joe Dirt makes $75K / yr and has $20K saved up.  He decides to buy a house

In that 30 years his home has doubled in value to $200

Jane Doe makes $75K / yr also and has $50K saved up.  She puts 20% down on a $250


Lets run the numbers shall we:

***JOE DIRT***

$80

**Total of Principal + Interest + Taxes:** $174

**Expected maintenance of $3000 (3%/year):** $90

**Total cost:** ~$264

**Net Profit: NEGATIVE $64

***JANE DOE***

$200

**Total of Principal + Interest + Taxes:** $435

**Expected maintenance of $7

**Total cost:** ~$660

**Net Profit: NEGATIVE $160

***LETS NOT FORGET***

Jane Doe also has higher heating/electic and other utility costs associated with that larger house.

In addition the monthly payments are:

Joe Dirt: $484.24
Jane Doe: $1

Meaning that Joe Dirt could in theory sink an extra $725 a month into the mortgage to pay it off faster

***SO WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN!?***

What this means is that you should spend the least on a house you can call home!  Home is where the heart is

The average home is 600 square feet bigger than it was in the 1970's [source](http://www.census.gov/const/C25Ann/sftotalmedavgsqft.pdf) and they only keep getting bigger.  So if you are thinking of buying a home

**Disclaimer:** For some people ""The American Dream"" is owning the home of their dreams.  To these people owning the home is enough for them to say ""I've made it

For the rest of us who think ""our home is an investment so I'm gunna buy one thats big and comfy.""  Ask yourself how much money could you really save giving up some of that quality of life?  By my estimates it's around ***7.5% a year*** on every dollar you don't spend on a house.

Someone else mentioned a few weeks before they had stopped issuing debit cards. 

I had made the comment that Smartypig had a lot of the same people involved including early angel investors and backing bank and since their business model was very similar people may want to use their rewards with SmartyPig.

I actually am a SmartyPig user and this morning in an effort to follow my own advice attempted to order a debit card. I was given a warning that they are no longer issuing them for the time being. It could be a coincidence but I felt it was worth throwing up a warning flag to everyone here.

Here are some details:

1.  I'm mid-twenties, and have been working in software development since college (as an analyst, not a programmer.)

2.  I bought a condo back in February, utilities, and the loan together are about $1400/month.

3.  My 401(k) has about $21K in it.

4.  I have $4K left of credit card debt at 9%.  The card has a $25K max.

5.  I have a couple of student loans totalling $7K

6.  My car is paid off and worth about $10K.

I'll be hitting the classifieds pretty heavily over the next couple of days

1.  Cash out the 401(k) and use it to cover the next few loan payments.

2.  Cover everything on credit card until the next job comes

3.  Sell the car.

4.  Sell the condo. (I really, and it would take me a couple months to get it sold - thanks, condo association rules!)

5.  Enlist in the military.

This means ATMs are now the ""soft target""; where criminals can use the easily cloned magnetic strips and still drain money from bank accounts. When EMV was implemented in Britain

So what'll happen? Crooks used to doing fraud at retail will start doing it at ATMs more. Criminals look for the weakest link - and ATMs are going to become them because upgrading them to support chips is a highly manual process.

- Feel free to tug at the card reader and PIN pad to see if they move. If anyone asks what you're doing

- Try to use ATMs within bank vestibules if possible

•I am a fifty-seven-year-old male

•About one in five of us is retired. About two-thirds of us who are working are self-employed. Interestingly, such as doctors and accountants. 

•Many of the types of businesses we are in could be classified as dullnormal. We are welding contractors, owners of mobile-home parks, pest controllers, coin and stamp dealers, and paving contractors. 

•About half of our wives do not work outside the home. The number-one occupation for those wives who do work is teacher. 

•Our household's total annual realized (taxable) income is $131, while our average income is $247,000. Note that those of us who have incomes in the $500,000 to $999,999 category (8 percent) and the $1 million or more category (5 percent) skew the average upward. 

•We have an average household net worth of $3.7 million. Of course, or 50th percentile) millionaire household has a net worth of $1.6 million. 

•On average

•Most of us (97 percent) are homeowners. We live in homes currently valued at an average of $320

•Most of us have never felt at a disadvantage because we did not receive any inheritance. About 80 percent of us are first-generation affluent. 

•We live well below our means. We wear inexpensive suits and drive American-made cars. Only a minority of us drive the current-model-year automobile. Only a minority ever lease our motor vehicles. 

•Most of our wives are planners and meticulous budgeters. In fact

•We have a ""go-to-hell fund."" In other words, we could live longer than that, since we save at least 15 percent of our earned income. 

•We have more than six and one-half times the level of wealth of our nonmillionaire neighbors, these nonmillionaires outnumber us better than three to one. Could it be that they have chosen to trade wealth for acquiring high-status material possessions? 

•As a group, 6 percent medical degrees, and 6 percent Ph.D.s. 

•Only 17 percent of us or our spouses ever attended a private elementary or private high school. But 55 percent of our children are currently attending or have attended private schools. 

•As a group, and our grandchildren. We spend heavily for the educations of our offspring. 

•About two-thirds of us work between forty-five and fifty-five hours per week. 

•We are fastidious investors. On average

•We hold nearly 20 percent of our household's wealth in transaction securities such as publicly traded stocks and mutual funds. But we rarely sell our equity investments. We hold even more in our pension plans. On average

•As a group, have the deck of economic cards stacked in their favor. They should not need subsidies from their parents. 

•What would be the ideal occupations for our sons and daughters? There are about 3.5 millionaire households like ours. Our numbers are growing much faster than the general population. Our kids should consider providing affluent people with some valuable service. Overall

-----

It pains me to have to write about something like this on a forum

My family has suffered a lot of turmoil over the years because one of my siblings had to get serious surgery as a baby to survive (and a few more surgeries continuing into his youth). Medical bills were astronomical.. actually, etc. I'm sure you all heard of ""pre-existing condition"" in insurance, well.. my mom could then never quit HER job, because no insurance companies would cover my sibling because of all of his medical problems. Talk about a dilemma. Other family crises occurred and my dad always had to be the one to help out, because my mother couldn't quit her job, she had the benefits. My dad finally had a great job in home improvement but when 9/11 happened he was laid off. He does not have a college degree, even though I personally think he is a brilliant man, and reliable, and doesn't have the time to compile and send out his bills while doing current work. It is very hard for my parents to make ends meet bill-wise. Now that I and my siblings are older

As a 22 year old, I am afraid we are going to lose our house. This scares the living crap out of me.

I've tried really hard to help them as much as I could. I have been working on my own company out of my basement and I am now making more than I ever had in a real job. On top of trying to pay off my $100

I finally was able to get in touch with some debt collectors today, its a 725.. is this good?)  I am hoping to take out a loan for them to get them situated but I know this will not fix the problem. I know my dad cannot handle being a handyman anymore. He needs something where he doesn't need 1,000 tools and personally hand write all his bills. 

Literally, but I am just so scared about this uncertainty.

So a few things to close this up: 
1. If ANYONE out there is hiring (in Maryland - Baltimore County preferred)

2. If any of you could help me figure out where to get a loan

3. Has anyone been foreclosed upon? What are some things I should do? Should I call the attorney?

-- UPDATE -- 4. After speaking with the bank

I am just asking for any assistance or advice. Thank you in advance

**Now onto brass tacks. What did I do today? What happened?**

I thought carefully about what Reddit said. Today I forged a path using what I determined to be the most intelligent and relevant pieces of advice in the thread. I began this morning by asking my boss for a private meeting. We met later that afternoon. In this meeting I began by telling him I was

1. Unhappy with my compensation.
2. That because of my contributions to the company
3. That because of 2\.
4. That a 25% raise was eminently fair based on 2\. and 3\.
5. At this point, so I asked for a bonus equal to 50% of my annual salary.

He told me that a 25% raise would make me the highest paid employee with my title

He tried to fish for reasons why I came to him all of a sudden with such a huge compensation request. I told him I'd been putting off this conversation for a long time. I told him that I wasn't there to compare myself with other employees

He told me he would get back to me at the end of the day. 5:30 rolls around

* 20% raise
* 50% of my annual salary as a bonus

What is the likelihood of being able to receive some sort of forgiveness/forbearance/deferment on some of my loans? And should I seek that forgiveness/forbearance/deferment from my private lenders or from my Federal lender?

1355360954.0,14rbbl,[ProTip] You are probably calculating cost of living vs salary differences incorrectly.  ,Cheesejaguar,192,43,119,"**TL;DR don't compare only salary differences and cost of living differences to give you comparisons for where you'll better stretch your dollar**

I've seen this a couple of times here

&gt; Making $100k a year in RichTown is like making $50k a year in RuralTown since the cost of living is twice as high in RichTown

You're not accurately comparing the two cities.  I'll explain with quick case study.  Let's compare my hometown

Let's say I live in San Jose,000 a month, or $24,000 a year.  San Jose has a cost of living index of 168.  You will owe approximately $18,000 in Federal taxes, leaving you with $58,000 a year.  

Buffalo,000 a year for cost of living.  Here is where the fallacy comes into play, if you assume that because it is 1-(78/168)% (that's not right is it?) cheaper to live in Buffalo, your salary can be (78/168) as much.  This is where you would be wrong!  (78/168) * $100k gives you a salary of $46,400 a year.  After $11k in living expenses and $5k in taxes, you are left with $30,000.  

I've purposefully narrowed out the cost of living to rent + bills + food because these are the things most likely to be effected by regional price variations.  Here is a quick list of things that are not appreciably less expensive in Buffalo than San Jose

* Electronics
* Cars 
* Airfare (Likely more expensive from places far from regional hubs)
* Public University Tuition (Buff State $5570/yr vs San Jose State $7000/yr)

Some things will be less (labor for contractors/mechanics/plumbers etc), but you're probably not walking to the store in Buffalo).  

In summary that leftover $58, than the $30,000 a year.  Even if purchases in this category of ""non-living"" expensive were more expensive across the board, its extremely unlikely that it would be twice as expensive.  If we assumed an even cost of items in this category, you would need to earn $80,000 a year in Buffalo to feel like you were earning $100k a year in San Jose.  

**Conclusion**

Of course this is greatly effected by your spending habits; what you do with that leftover money will effect how much more expensive/cheaper a certain area would be to you.  If you guys could help me refine this a bit

The story starts about 6 months ago when my motorcycle broke down. I needed about $200 for parts, and said I was going to get some gas to fill up the tank, and she told me to hold on while she put some money on my card. This rose a bit of a red flag with me.

I've been married for nearly 4 years now, everything. I'm just the guy that brings home the paycheck. Before December I hadn't even logged into my bank account in probably close to a year, my wife just handled everything.

* CC- $4400 at 11.00%  
* CC- $3500 at 20.99%  
* CC- $3400 at 16.24%  
* CC- $2700 at 15.99%  
* CC- $2700 at 9.90%  
* Several store specific cards (Target, etc..) not even sure... Monthly minimums are around $700.  
* Car loan - $450 per month  
* Mortgage - $1500 per month  
* Student loans - $40k or so
* $5 in our savings account

Basically every credit card my wife has is maxed, I haven't bought any work clothes except for a couple button down shirts in the past 3 years and a new pair of dress shoes, I never eat out, I had been driving the same car for the past 11 years until we traded it in in June for a new SUV for my wife and now I drive her old car that's new to me.

For January I decided we would track all of our spending. I really couldn't see where our money was going other than to minimum payments to all the credit cards.

* I spent $30- ate out twice
* Wife spent $430- new shoes
* $100 on entertainment- went out on a date and saw a movie  
* $230 on gas  
* $480 on food (not counting the individual eating out or the date together)  
* $160 on stuff for the house  
* $44 on misc stuff from Walmart and Target  
* $400 on Utilities  
* $1500 on the Mortgage  
* $700 towards the miscellaneous cards
* $200 on Insurance  
* $200 towards the wife's business

That total comes out to about $5k

Using a spreadsheet I found that if I keep putting $1600 towards the big credit card debt I can reduce it from $23k down to about $8k by making minimum payments on everything except the highest interest cards and working my way down. Is that what I should be focusing on?

The biggest problem I have here is that my wife knows that we were supposed to be saving last month, but she justifies all of her spending as necessary in order to keep her clients and her business. She needs fancy clothes, new shoes, and expensive haircuts etc.

Any advice? What should I do in this situation?

I just wanted to share a spreadsheet I use in Google Docs that helps me keep track of my expenses every two weeks so I know what my balance will look like as I make purchasing decisions throughout the year. This keeps me from making a lot of unnecessary dumb purchases if I don't know how it will impact my balance two or three months down the line. I look at this daily and have sort of turned saving money into a hobby and it's helped me get out of debt over the last year. 


Here is a link to download the spreadsheet template with examples of income and purchases and I highly recommend using it on Google Docs so you can restore past revisions if you mess up: 


http://www65.zippyshare.com/v/97953104/file.html


The very first column will be your current total balance in your checking account right now. I don't keep track of my savings that way I don't know how much I have in there to be tempted to transfer it if I get low.


Next up


Add or subtract rows only between 3 to 18 to add your own expenses. I keep my monthly bills I pay every month at the top and fill out the balances all the way across. The template I have is basically what my gf spends money on and I try to categorize miscellaneous purchases under household. 


I use this sheet in combination of an app called Balance for iOS as I don't keep paper receipts. I add my purchases immediately and when I get home I input them in my spreadsheet


After every paycheck I hide the previous column that way I am only looking at what's current. I tried using other services such as Mint.com but I found that doing it manually this way was more instant and it allows me to see what I can have in my checking account a year from now based on any purchases I make in between. In my personal spreadsheet I already have plane tickets and some other travel expenses filled in leaving a nice balance. It helps me control a lot of my spending and I hope this could help someone who might prefer budgeting/saving this way. Once I get to a certain amount in my checking


I only have one credit card so I manually just add up what I spend on the bottom and will add the same total onto the row around when my statement is sent out. Everything else is pretty automated.

If you go look up a list of top median salaries by profession, and about that or more for well paid lawyers, doctors, etc. 

Statistics like those, stock options, etc. which are a big part of compensation in more lucrative careers, nor for self-made income through investment or other methods.

Maybe there are books or better stats out there that I've missed

**Climbing the Corporate Ladder:** This probably the most straightforward, likely requiring an MBA and/or other advanced degrees, but compensation can range from $200K-1MM+

**Going Out on Your Own:** Consultancies, etc. This seems to be a sweet spot for business savvy people in an industry that can support small-to-medium businesses. Most people successful in this arena have a background with a more established company where they developed contacts, familiarity with the industry they work in, and a work history to attract clients. Has a comparatively low cost of entry in terms of resume-style qualifications, but possibly higher in terms of actual skills, and compensation seems to concentrate in the $300-800K range.

**Being Able to Do What No One Else Can:** Athletes, etc. Sort of an extreme version of the above, this doesn't seem to be something you can pursue predictably and so the cost of entry is arguably indeterminably high, but simply having skills that no one can match in a lucrative field leads to seemingly unbounded income. The big problems are possibly very short career either due to fast moving competition or difficult to predict setbacks, and difficulty finding work afterward, but can often lead into ""Going Out on Your Own"" in a related small business afterward.

**Income Investing:** Managed real estate, but seems pretty reliable compared to other methods.

Obviously people mix and match, overcoming their hurdles and pitfalls seem to be the way most people who make it above and beyond typical incomes manage to do it.

I called the company and they are taking their time figuring this out while I'm left here stressing over it.  They've mentioned keywords like capitalized interest.

I don't fully understand how capitalized interest works.  In my mind

My old direct loans statement show $1784.47 in the capitalized interest field

I am single, 13) and I am 34 years old. Been divorced 3 years. Have 2.5 years of college under my belt, do NOT get child support... I make about 23K a year, and I do not have ANY debt.

The only thing I get from the state is free medical for the children. I tried to get my own

Someone is going to ask so... I don't get child support because when I got divorced he had no job, you read that right) he basically says he is broke, lives with friends, and because I can not find his address and he lives in another state I can not serve him. He did send some money for the kids for Christmas for the first time this year... 

I manage to go to school by taking a full course load (usually 3 classes, gas, etc. etc. I am about a year to 1.5 years from getting my transfer degree. 

I keep my expenses down by owning my car. I bought it a little over a year ago when my old car finally gave out

Every year when taxes come around I take 80% of my tax return and put it down on my rent for the year. This allows me to pay less each month, and with deposits, and pet fees I could only afford 8 months.

Almost every stick of furniture in my house was bought at Goodwill or a gift from friends. Bellevue has the most amazing Goodwill where you can find some very nice furniture, and have only bought a few minor things since.

I got internet when I moved in, and that is my TV viewing, plus whatever I find online. 

We go to free places when we go out usually. The park, etc. etc. Though I do splurge a little and take the kids to a nice restaurant or attraction every three months when I get a bonus at work, if I get it. 

Oh, so like I said... I'm not broke. I actually do alright, and when my car breaks I'm not worried.

*** *Edit 2: Two errors have been pointed out. One: The stocks qualify after two years from the beginning of the offering period. Two: I used the formula for compounding interest

**** *Note: It makes sense to calculate annual return on an investment that can only be made for 1.5 months. This is so that you can compare it with other investments that can be made for the remaining part of the year. Think of it this way: a 66% annual return over a month and a half beats inflation by 63%. If I were to call it a 10% return

**TL;DR at bottom**

An Employee Stock Purchasing Plan (**ESPP**) works as follows:

1. You designate payroll deductions to be held for stock purchasing. There is a **deduction limit**

2. At certain intervals

3. The price that you purchase the stock at is discounted by two means: The first is a standard percent reduction. I am calling this the **discount**. The second discount is that some companies may allow you to buy stock at a previous close price. Sometimes the price is the close price on the day you started making contributions to buying stock

4. If the lookback price is lower than the **market price** on the day that the stock is purchased

5. You now have company stock. Congratulations. You can sell this stock immediately as a **Disqualified Disposition**. You will pay taxes on the proceeds from the sale just like normal income.

6. You may wait a certain amount of time (usually a year), and even the IRS seems to be confused by the implications. Basically, part of the proceeds will be taxed as capital gains, not income.

First of all

---

**A Hypothetical Scenario**:

The *lookback* and *market price* of your company stock are both $100. The *term* is 3 months. Your *discount* is 10%. You chose to contribute $90 over 3 months. Your *tax rate* is 25%.

We first need to know how long your investment is tied up. You may be tempted to say 3 months, or a month and a half.

You buy 1 stock for $90, over an average of 1.5 months. Your return for a month and a half is 7.5/90, or 8.33%. 8% isn't a bad investment, right? Well hold on! That is not the yearly return. We calculate that using this formula:

    (End Value / Beginning Value) ^ (1 / # Years) - 1

This equates to a yearly return of 89.71%. WOW. Oh right

And think! Your returns will be even higher if the lookback price was lower than the market price.

If the *lookback price* were 80, and sell them for $100 a piece, making $125 dollars. $53 dollars would be taxed, leaving you with $129.75. At an initial investment of $90 over and average of a month and a half, you had a 44.16% return, or a 1,766.03% yearly return WITH ZERO RISK. Still, oh well. There is still **no better place to put your money**.

---

It is a shame that you can't put your whole check in there. It is a damn shame that you can't put your entire wealth pool into an ESPP. You'd billionaire and retired in a few years. But sadly, you should be participating to the max.

Even though you can get a bit of money quickly by selling immediately, using a [CALCULATOR](http://twtitw.firebus.com/node/270). (I'm not smart enough to do the math on Qualifying Dispositions. It is a hairy mess, and even the IRS can't keep it straight).

---

**Another Hypothetical Set of Scenarios**:

The *market price* is $100. The *discount* is 10%. Taxes are 25% on income

I'm going to gloss over the math a bit here, the investment time for an immediate sale is 1.5 months, and 13.5 months if you wait for the sale to qualify.

**If the *lookback* price is 100

If we wait until the sale qualifies

* 100 to match the profit.

* 100.2647 to match the buying power.

* 100.7941 to match a 9% return.

* 107.9156 to match the 89.71% return.

**If the *lookback* price is 80,458.33 (674.82% yearly return).**

If we wait until the sale qualifies

* 97.6470 to match the profit.

* 98.3880 to match the buying power.

* 99.8705 to match a 9% return.

* Around 264 to match the 674.82% return.

I'm going to say that the investment isn't really worth it unless it beats inflation

---

Yes

I'm going to go ahead and say WRONG. Dead wrong. The returns are not that much better

The risk is not worth it. If you're contributing to an ESPP

Take the quick

Don't try to beat the odds by waiting for qualification. The terms change based on previous company growth

Oh

I've been figuring this out entirely on my own and would love to error-test it against the collective wisdom here. What am I overlooking?

Thank you all for your counsel.

EDIT: Thank you all for your comments. Many of you have been raising questions that are at the margin between personal finance and philosophy; let me comment some more to address that.

I want to retire so that I can spend more time enjoying and raising my kids. They are little boys now, and in a career path (law) that is already quite thoroughly stocked with people, to say the least. So every day has a big opportunity cost, which either must be paid by financial security (if I choose my family over work) or by my family (if I choose work over my family). That is a little bit stark, and is an exaggeration, but I say it to help you understand my motivations.

Now my philosophy. In the big picture I believe that many of us in the privileged first-world West live in bondage to our own fear. We have been taught to be afraid, and we get up and go to work from fear.  It must not be true that five million, or ten million, is necessary to be safe; if so, then almost nobody is safe. And anyone who has worked to get that much money so that they will be safe won’t feel safe once they have it. The habit of working because of fear doesn’t make you safe, it makes you afraid.

Now, in a sensible, calm, happy way, for tomorrow. The wiser practitioners of any major religion and a number of other philosophies can teach a path to this. Financial planning alone can’t begin to touch it. (And I agree with all of you who have said that I need to have something to do when I retire; that’s a piece of the puzzle that I just described.)

So yes, a global depression caused by an oil crash, volcanoes, alien invasion, etc. could wreck my plans. And those of everyone else. We all need to keep our eyes open and make adjustments when necessary, but at some point I think that it is madness to continue spending a large portion of one’s time and energy storing away resources for the future. The universe is going to grind down and destroy us all, and what we ultimately fear is death, and if you spend all of it getting ready for it

This doesn’t mean that retirement is any Shangri-la of freedom from fear
So ultimately

1368734344.0,1egyxf,"Retirement Calculations, or, How Much Should I Have Saved by Now?",RedRedditRabbit,150,70

Like all of my posts

First assumption: You will stop getting real raises in your early 40's. Lots of studies have been conducted on this

Second assumption: You started working, but hopefully you were saving something.

Third assumption: You won't be getting any social security. This will probably be the most debatable of the assumptions

Final assumption: Your investments will return a solid 5% (real) APR over the entirety of your working career. Again

Lets lay out some math.

We're going to use a **s**afe **w**ithdrawal **r**ate of 4% to plan your retirement years. There are lots of good arguments for and against using a 4% SWR, we're going to use this one because it has good data behind it, and it's simple.

A 4% SWR means that is you want to live on $80k per year

Another good multiplier to keep in mind is 80%. *Generally speaking* retirees spend about 80% of what they would have spent during their working years. So, *that* means that in retirement you'll only need $64k.

So what does this all boil down to? Time for some tables!

If you work for 40 years you'll need to save about 17% of your salary every year. Here's an example of someone that starts working at age 26

Age	|	Salary Multiple
:--	|	--:
31	|	1x
37	|	2x
41	|	3x
44	|	4x
47	|	5x
51.5	|	7x
55	|	9x
58	|	11x
60.5	|	13x
65	|	17x

So if you're currently 45 years old, and have about 4-4.5x your salary saved up. (If you make $100k, you should have $400-450k saved.) If you're under that, time to start contributing more!

What if we shorten that time period down? How much should you save if you want to retire in 30 years? You need to save an average of 30% of your income. Let's start at 22 this time and work until we're 51:

Age	|	Salary Multiple

Simply drag those 4 right-most columns down to fill in the formulas up to age 65 or wherever you want to stop

A couple of things to keep in mind. If you're married, your salary is more likely to cap out when you're in your late 30s, instead of mid 40's. Sorry, that's just what the research shows happens. If you want to tailor this to your own real &amp; expected salary values instead of using the estimates go ahead, just change the numbers in the ""Salary Estimate"" column to whatever you want, just remember that this is in real values, so if you're going to use the salary you actually made 20 years ago don't forget the inflation.

Personal Finance (and of course other amazing subreddits including /r/money, deal with bills and invest better. But a lot of the time the subject of making money is not too heavily touched upon.

A higher income is something everyone desires, they can't grasp the opportunities that have already arisen.

I am creating this topic in the hopes that it will be added upon by the great financially minded of reddit


Below is a small list of opportunities that I think are real ways to make money that aren't as conventional as going straight from school to a job and slowly rising the ranks (e.g. the conventional way).

**Money Making**

- *Royalties* - Often considered out of the box but very simple is the concept of royalties. If you can create something that will slowly trickle in money, do not be afraid to try writing. ~~**Photography**, or more specifically stock photography, is great for those who are never without their camera and know how to take a nice picture. You can sell your stock photos and receive small payments from each use of the photo. Some people barely leave their camera alone and to make money all they have to do is select some of their nicer photos at the end of the week and sell them.~~ **Web design** is something a large percentage of people know the basics of, but not many people specialize in. Making a website that appeals to a niche community isn't all that hard, and the ads on your site will run you a nice small profit if you can get enough page views. Consider taking online tutorials to bump up your current knowledge of the programming codes and you can find yourself hosting a website dedicated to something you have a great passion for, while turning a decent profit. **Art/drawing**, can be sold in similar ways to stock photography

- *Capturing Niche Markets* - Well developed markets can be difficult to enter with severe competition stifling any attempt to enter the business. Niche markets are sometimes difficult to find, but a decent few (in my anecdotal experience) business men have started out on sites such as Craigslist. They learn what the city they are in has a demand for but nearly no supply, and they advertise on Craigslist with huge interest. For example, someone with carpentry skills could easily find out that the location they're in has a lot of upper-middle class cat lovers and could create [cat castles](http://www.crazycatcondos.com/rocketcattree.jpg) with 30 dollar worth of material, which would sell rather easily on Craigslist for hundreds, depending on the quality. If you can't build one, buy bulk quantities and set them up then sell them for a decent, profit.

- *Flipping* - Flipping is basically the same as before

- *High pay work* - This may sacrifice love of work for love of money. Simply put

A small majority of people use their spare time for things such as filling in surveys, research you city for what you could sell there, even going to your neighbors and asking if they'd like their lawn mowed for 10 bucks if a much higher pay rate.

I was recently offered a great job with a very generous company.  Full benefits, plus its just a great company to work for--everyone I've ever spoken with loves this business and what it stands for. Applying for this job was a bit of a long shot--I have experience doing everything the job requires, but little direct experience with the actual job.  But, I fit in with the company culture well, and they offered me the job!  Unfortunately they offered me the very bottom of their salary range.  Should I negotiate for a little more, or thank my lucky stars that I got this job and leave well enough alone?  I think some of my guilt over asking for more stems from the fact that I feel lucky to have gotten this job at all, and the company is generous in other ways.  But a little more would be nice

My initial goal was to have everything paid off by the end of 2013, I contributed 6% of each paycheck to my 401K - which is the max amount of what my company will match.  On top of that, I started a Roth IRA in which I made the minimum contribution of $100 a month.  I have also been able to build up around $20K in my savings account (I had around $3K when I started working).  I definitely could have put a lot of this towards my student loans, but was happy with my current monthly payment amounts and having that strong base in my savings is important to me.

My question to you is now what should be my next financial step/goal?  I drive a 2000 Toyota Camry which is still running good, how much?  If I am considering a new car in the future, how much should I have saved up?  What else should I be considering?

Finally - a curveball question.  I have the opportunity to move to NYC this summer making $64K.  With all things considered, but would be moving alone and looks like I would need to be making $1600-$1800 rent payments (from my understanding).

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help.

1362418225.0,19nbsb,Discussion:  priority list for saving/debt relief ,GaelicDrip,139,31,58,"Many of the posts to this forum are of the ""how should I save and/or relieve debt"" variety. I decided to take a whack at a priority list on how to apply your regular or windfall income with an eye toward long-term wealth building. This list reflects how I would do things

Note that the goal is to complete each item before moving to the next. Most of us won't be able to do all of these things

One last thing:  I’m not sure how to factor in HSAs.  My gut feeling is that it should be tiered in some fashion much like the retirement savings goals I’ve outlined (e.g., max out after step 9).  Thoughts?

Proposed priority list:

**1. Keep all debts/accounts current**

Pay your monthly minimums on time. This is critical to ensure that your credit rating remains strong.

**2. Create a 1 month emergency fund (equal to one month of expenses)**

Life throws curve balls sometimes

**3. Take advantage of employer retirement match**

Tax deferred saving + a guaranteed return (courtesy of your employer) is a major wealth builder.

**4. Pay down high interest debts (after tax interest &gt; 12%)**

High interest debt quickly erodes wealth building.

**5. Create a 2 month emergency fund**

More curve ball readiness.

**6. Pay down moderate interest debts (after tax interest &gt; 5%)**

Paying off debts is a guaranteed zero risk return

**7. Contribute to Roth IRA/401k up to $10k total.**

Building the nest egg. Generally speaking, focus upon the 401k (or other pretax accounts like 403b or IRA).

**8. Create a 3 month emergency fund**

3 months of expenses is a reasonable long-term goal.

**9. Liquid savings up to $10k/year**

Good for special purchases (car, whatever)

**10. Max out retirement contributions.**

Nest egg-o-rama.

**11. Pay off low interest loans (after tax interest &lt; 5%).**

Debt free is the way to be!

**12. Add to liquid savings.**

Just because you can.

1371738917.0,1gq8vb,Sell house or rent it out?,three-one-seven,135,24,115,"Here's my situation:

My wife and I bought our first house back in the spring of 2010 and got the $8,000 into remodeling the house since I've owned it, and I refinanced it last fall to get a better rate ($117,000 @ 3.875%).  We're thinking about moving into something bigger and closer to work eventually, and now that mortgage rates are starting to creep back up I'm thinking it might be best to move sooner rather than later so I can lock in a good rate on a more ""permanent"" house.  The question is, should I rent our house out or sell it?

The mortgage on the house is a 7/1 ARM at 3.875%.  I am about six months into the seven years.  The total payment right now is $752/month; that includes P&amp;I, I'll either sell it or refinance it before the seven years is up.)

If we sell, 2) that house won't be our problem anymore, and 3) no landlord headaches.  I didn't have to put any money down on this house, but I may have to on the next one.  Plus, the house was built in the mid-90s, so it may need a new AC unit, furnace, I pass those things on to the next owner.

If we rent it out, long-term tenants.  If I am able to get $1150/month in rent, that's a gross profit of $4800 per year.  The best case scenario is that I don't have to make any major repairs to the property and can pocket most of that money every year.  That will help tremendously with paying down student loans and such, or I can just roll it into the mortgage on the rental property and rack up equity faster.  The worst case scenario is that I have to replace all three of the major systems I mentioned before: roof, AC, and furnace.  In that case, I'd be out at least $20k, even in that case

What do you guys think?  This is sort of in the baby-steps phase for us; my wife and I are thinking the best thing to do is wait until next spring either way.  I am just trying to get all the information I can between now and then.

**Edit: Thanks to everyone who commented here with advice and personal experience stories.  The two things that stick out to me the most from everyone's advice and/or questions are: if we go the rental route, tenant turnover, and non-payment.  Also, since I don't have the income to qualify for a second house unless I can count the rental income toward my DTI ratio, I need to talk to some mortgage lenders and find out if this is even doable at this time.

I'm 27 years old and I work as a software developer in manhattan. I have been working at this software company for 3.5 years now and enjoy the people and the work.  I am living in my parents 4br house with my 3 younger siblings at the moment.  I lived in apartments around New York City for about 2 years when I first started this job but never was able to fit in with any community so I moved back in with my parents after feeling some homesickness.

I've saved $57k in a savings acct and an extra $14k in a traditional ira, but $7k of it is at 5%), and my salary is $75k with a bonus of about $30k at the end of the year.  I'm also single and have never been in a serious relationship.

Given my current financial and living situations, renting an apartment in NYC, pursue a graduate degree, look for a higher paying job, or traveling somewhere in or out of the country perhaps. But those are just some general ideas.

I come from ""lower-middle"" class parents and I'm doing my best to work hard and smart to come up from where I grew up. Now that I've earned and saved some money I'm not entirely clear on how to responsibly utilize it. My siblings are still very young (25, still poor and don't earn close to what I earn.  My mother is a minimum wage cashier and my father earns $70k/year as an IT guy but most of his money is spent paying his mortgage ($90k remaining) and paying a debt of $250k he owes from failed business ventures in his past (which I think he'll never be able to repay)

My parents are currently in their early 60's. They own a small business and are currently still spending most of their time running the business. They are considering possibly retiring soon in which case they will have a lot more free time and a lot more cash to invest. My parents have signed up for a course with this company to learn how to actively invest their savings. The course is run by: http://www.tradingacademy.com/

Does anyone have any experience with this company? I'm curious if anyone has had any good or bad experiences to share. I don't think its a scam necessarily but I for one think it is a really bad idea for them to sign up for this. The company charges 5 figures for their classes which I think is a LOT. The price of the course is almost 10% of what they would be investing so if they take this course, read a couple books and passively invest their money in very conservative investments like index funds.

My story (if it matters) began 7 years ago (give or take a few months) when I had a great job making 75K+ a year in a small town with low cost of living so that 75k felt more like 125k. I was in a long term live together relationship with someone younger than myself who did not have much credit so the house, credit cards, etc were all in my name but her pay of around $30k helped pay the bills. We lived beyond our means and racked up bills left and right trying to keep up with the Jones.

Then I lost my job due to the company merger/buyout

As the house was close to foreclosure with the mailbox full of bills

So that's when I packed up, just vanished from my obligations. I got clean quick and found work after about a year where I could but it never was a long term job so if debt collectors were trying to track me via employment I was probably gone by the time they sent any garnishment letter. I would say I had about 5-6 jobs during this time but there all part time short term things lasting a month or so then more unemployment. I used cash for everything including paying my mom each month for a car she gave me the cash to buy. My phone was a prepaid.

I moved into a apartment 2 years ago with a new girlfriend but we both use cash for everything and neither use credit. The apt

So

Do I simply sign up with all 3 credit report companies and start disputing everything down the page as 'over 7 years old' and watch it all vanish after a month or two or will it be more complicated than that? Or...are there some debts that do not go away after 7 years? For insight my debts consisted of a house foreclosure, utility bills, and a loan or two from local finance companies. Total debt in my name 7 years ago was if I had to guess maybe around $160k-$175K.

UPDATE: Thanks to some comments so far I looked up my state. Statute of limitations on loans and general debt is 6 years; credit cards is generally 4 years. Court judgements for my state have a 12% interest rate and they also have a statute of limitation of 7 years from the judgement date. This might explain why I haven't been contacted in the last year or so now that my life is easily track-able through tax returns and stable employment. So even though they are on my credit report some or possibly all of the debts have expired past their statute of limitations.",,t5_2qstm,1358829019.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/170f9f/advice_for_someone_who_vanished_from_creditors/

&gt; Because of this, total bond indexes “are deeply flawed — and that’s coming from an indexer.”  He adds that individual investors should keep only about one-third of their bond stake in Treasuries and government debt, reflecting the market’s mix based on private investors such as pension and mutual funds.  

&gt; Investors might consider keeping half their money in a total bond market fund, investors would end up with an overall strategy that’s about two-thirds in corporate debt and one-third in government securities.

Your taxes are based off your Modified AGI.  Deductions are claims that reduce your taxable income (reduce your MAGI).  Credits are claims that reduce your actual taxes owed.  That means if you're paying 5k in taxes and you have a 5k deduction... you will still be paying something like $3500-4k in taxes.  If you have a 5k credit that means you pay 0$ in taxes.

I have problems though. I have about 13k in debt -- half of that is my car and half of that is credit card. My rating is in the dumps (about 575 the last time I checked). The card debt is split over four accounts: one with 5100$, limit is 1000$ and is strictly with a garage) and one with ~600$ that is in collections. I have another account in collections that I contested and it hasn't been acted on (it's for 600$ but only 300$ of the debt is valid*, I offered to settle with the phone company if they'd adjust it to what it should have been, but they wouldn't and sent me to collections). I don't have interest rates on hand right now, but I should be able to get them fairly easily. I know my car and biggest card have the highest interest.

My bills break down this way:
Car -- 240$
Phone -- 116$ (I know I should probably cancel my smart phone plan
Insurance -- 103$ (down from the 170$ I was paying like a dipshit)
CC1 - 150$

Basically, a laptop that is basically my life, a monitor and speaker set that might fetch 100$ together, 200$ if I'm lucky. I'd hate to see them go, but I could live with it.

I'm thinking of getting a second job overnight to earn extra money. The prospect of being even more exhausted all the time isn't enticing but I'd rather be tired than homeless. :/

I was doing a lot of reflecting after that post yesterday about the person in $240

Take someone who made the decision to go to college ~5 years ago. They made their decision prior to the economic crash of 2008. The cultural zeitgeist at that moment in time did not include discussions about student loans

I am now realizing the perhaps society's message to young people is changing, I think the message is, if you are wealthy (can afford to pay for college) or exceptionally talented (can get full scholarships), then yes, pursue your dreams! 

However, you likely may not be able to afford to study what you're passionate about at the moment you enter college. 

I think it's time to be realistic given the cost of higher education. The message to high schoolers should be: unless you have funds available to you, then chances are you cannot go to college and study what you're interested in. 

Your choices are then: (i) screw college and pursue what you're interested in with all your time and energy, but that will provide for a debt free life within a reasonable period of time or (iii) mitigate the cost of college by going to community college first and then go to a cheap state college (though, even here, loans could be an issue depending on what is studied).

My phone is under a family plan still. The bills have always been in my roommates name. When I was 21 it seemed like everyone was throwing credit applications at me. Now that I'm 25 and in a much better position financially - **no one will give me a credit card** . I just don't get it! Help??


* I was hoping some more knowledgable members could offer tips on how to start an investment plan. Do I even make enough money to start investing? Some blogs advise high-risk strategies for twenty-somethings others point to long-term low-risk early retirement strategies. Isn't the college debt bubble coming soon anyway

Any advice is really appreciated and thanks to everyone that's read this far. I'm just relaxing and getting ready for work tomorrow morning. I'll check back periodically. Have a nice evening!

BASICS
1.  Combined income of $6800 / month (after pension contributions)
2.  We work the same job (Ontario teachers) and so have a very good pension plan that we have been paying into for 6 years or so.   We also have tremendous job security
3.  I have ~$20

DEBTS

1.  We have a LOC (5%) of $6000 for our honeymoon (traveling March 2014) that we need to clear.
2.  $7900 on my car left to pay (at 1.9% interest).  Wife’s car is paid in full.
3.  Our Credit Cards are paid in full each month.

MY CURRENT PLAN:

I developed a detailed budget and decided to apply the Ramsey method of aggressively paying down each debt and going from there.  My plan is to aggressively attack the Line of Credit,000 in emergency savings.  From there, I will continue to boost the emergency savings while kicking back into the mutual funds and aggressively pay down the only remaining debt at that point, the house.  It will take about 18 months, to reach the debt free zone (other than the mortgage).

My questions are:

-	I scare myself all the time that I’m so old and have screwed up my finances so bad I’m going to be broke when I ‘m older.  Are we doing horribly?
-	Is it wise to do things one at a time
-	If we have a good pension through work (people always tell us it’s gold plated)
-	Any other suggestions?

1.  Thanks so much for all of the great advice!

When we were living a little more paycheck to paycheck, but when they were going to be paid as well.

What I did was set up another checking account with our bank to pay all of these bills. I seeded this account with $1000 of savings to prevent overdrafts due to timing. Then I calculated the biweekly cost of each of these bills. For varying bills like utilities, you can multiple the monthly cost by 12 and divide by 26. Adding all of these together, I was able to determine the total biweekly cost of these bills. From there, I set up a biweekly automatic transfer for this amount from my direct deposit account to my new bill pay account. Alternatively, some companies will split a direct depost to multiple accounts, but the transfer is easier for me to change if some bill changes.

This made things much easier on us. We were able to stop worry about a few bills coming up together and really focus on fixing other budget categories. I am more able to check our main checking account to see how we are doing without worrying when some bill is going to autopay.

* Gas

* Rent: $820

* Direct deposit to savings account (CDs): $1, which is why I’ve had to reexamine my investment strategy)
* Direct deposit to 401k (5% flat contributed by my employer &amp; currently 20% vested -- I don’t need to contribute to get the 5% from my employer): ~$1

* CDs

* 401k: $8, which I currently invest in.)

* 6 months. Is that 6 months of expenses or income? If expenses, I would stop driving to work (car expenses), could stop going for meals/drinks etc.

* How liquid does it need to be? I've noticed some people have bond ladders set up where a bond matures every month so they will have a months expenses coming to them every month. That works for a job loss but that doesn't work for a huge up front cost like a medical accident or significant house/car damage that isn't covered by insurance. Is that ok? Is that an acceptable risk? Or should you have access to the full amount instantly/within a couple days?

* What exactly is an emergency? I have seen some posts where people spent their E funds on car repairs, electronics. To me, those aren't emergencies. If you own a car, you can expect to have to pay for repairs, if you own a dog you can expect to take it to the vet. if you own a house, stuff is going to break and electronics are certainly not an emergency. For my car I set aside money for expected repairs, if I owned a pet I would do the same. Doesn't spending your E fund on such things defeat the purpose? If you spend it on car repairs and then lose your job suddenly you may not have 6 months expenses to live off of while you look for work. Or is that the point of the emergency fund?

A delayed thanks - reading here made me take my finances more seriously

Onto the topic at hand: **student loans

This idea is one that has been kicking around in my head for a bit. It came out of a few thoughts:

* Employers are pissed that workers are becoming less loyal.
* The reasons that we were loyal often had to do with long-term benefits - namely
* It is hard to build loyalty around a 401(K)
* Employees don't feel that companies are loyal to them
* Student loans are a problem

Then, the employer had the opportunity to use that money to help with an employee's student loan debt. I admit that I have not fleshed out the logistics fully, but I feel that there is a way to do this in a fair way. 


Approaching this as someone with a bunch of student loans, would help increase my loyalty. It might just be a personal thing, which is why I come to you. 


Idea's I have had on it (again, and that usually means I need to write it down and have other people tear it to shreds):

* Perfect world: It is not unlike a 401(K)
* Defined contributions: This I see as easier to implement. Its basically just money from the employer to throw at student loans. Could be hard to enforce that the money is going to the right place.
* I believe that student loans are structured different enough that this can be implemented in a way that minimizes abuse. Between distributions and the fact that they are rarely able to be discharged

My brother-in-law thinks they're insane, having their money tied up in a house instead of sitting in the bank (well, in gold bars and stacks of 20s in my dad's underwear drawer, actually) can only be a good thing, since it'll prevent using it to buy stupid shit like new cars and expensive musical instruments.

A traditional IRA appears to allow disbursements for ""qualified higher education expenses of owner,"" so that sounds like it might be the way to go. That way if I wind up with no one to send to school, I can just count it towards retirement.

Is a traditional IRA the best option for putting away money that might or might not be used for a child's education? Thanks!

**2013/03/20 10:51 EST - Answers so far:**

- A 529 account is probably a bad choice because the money would have to be used for education, and I have no current beneficiary. However, you can open a 529 for whoever - yourself, even - and then transfer it over to a different 529 naming your child as the beneficiary when the child is born ([source](http://www.savingforcollege.com/grandparents/answer.php?grandparent_faq_id=5)).

- A traditional IRA might be a good choice

- An ordinary investment account and/or taxable mutual funds might therefore be the way to go. 

**2013/03/20 14:43 EST:**

- Another option mentioned involves [Cash Value Life Insurance](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/college-finance/life-insurance-or-529-for-college-savings-1.aspx). I still don't fully get how it works, possibly even guaranteed. [**pmussoni**](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1anta4/college_savings_for_children_that_dont_exist_yet/c8z48jt) advocates this in this thread. I don't know. It sounds fancy. And potentially good. But also... immoral? It makes _sense_ that the government will offer me less financial aid if I've saved a lot of money for college. This loophole would seem to deprive more needy students of aid by making my child look poorer on paper than he really is.

1341175468.0,vw4pe,I see a lot of people seeking advice on picking a credit card. I wanted to share a little write-up of my thought process.,keggythekeg,102,11,15,"Before applying for my first credit card about two years ago

**Objective**

To maximize my rewards. I will never carry balance month-to-month.

**Where do I start?**

Check out some of the websites of the credit card companies you may already be familiar with and see what they have to offer. Remember those credit card ads you’ve seen on TV? Go see what they’re all about. You just want to get a feel for what’s out there to make an informed decision. You wouldn’t want to pick a credit card only to find out there was a much better one you could have gotten instead. To speed up your research efforts

**What you’ll find**

Look at what the different credit cards offer and you’ll start to notice some trends. Some charge an annual fee (like some American Express cards) and others offer do not. I made sure to pick one with no fee. The length of your credit history matters. If in the future I find myself not using this credit card I’m about to apply for, negatively affecting my credit score. Without a fee, I can safely put the card away, not use it, and not worry about paying just to keep it around.

Speaking of American Express, American Express, and Discover. Just keep in mind that Visa and MasterCard are accepted in more locations than the other two. If you went with an American Express or Discover card, you may find that some retailers or restaurants do not accept your card.

Many cards offer bonuses for certain categories of purchases. For example, have rotating bonus categories. Every 3 months, the card chooses 3 new categories that earn you bonus points.

**Narrowing it down**

When you start looking more closely at cards, you should be safe in applying for student credit cards. These are more slightly more lenient in their requirements.

I definitely preferred Visa and MasterCard to American Express and Discover. I only wanted to deal with one credit card that I could use almost anywhere while I was still learning.

**The Basic Strategy**

Find a couple of cards that seem like potential fits. Learn all about them

**An Example of My Thought Process**

Cash back cards were high up on my list. The idea of getting money for spending money I was going to spend one way or another was appealing. It seemed like the most you could get was a flat 2% cash back on every purchase. That’s pretty cool in my opinion. That’s like a getting a 2% off coupon on every purchase you make. Unfortunately, was replaced recently to many people’s dismay.

I used the 2% cash back as my bench mark. If I could earn more money back with points

I found a couple of credit cards that seemed like they might give me the most rewards. I am not a big fan of the rotating categories. I don’t like the unpredictability of the points

The Citi Forward piqued my interest. It offered bonus points on restaurants, video rental stores and movie theaters. This fit my college lifestyle well because I mainly spent money on food and books (also it turns out all Amazon purchases are categorized as bookstore purchases!).

I did some digging around on one of my favorite credit card forums FatWallet’s Finance section. I looked up what sort of redemption rates Citi offers with its points. They didn’t offer a very good redemption rate for cash, I receive 5 points on the aforementioned bonus categories and 1 point on every other purchase.

So I thought about a typical semester and made a conservative estimate of my expenses (3 months long).

* $300 in textbooks
* $300 in restaurants
* $400 in flights
* $200 miscellaneous

With the Citi Forward card,000 points (or $1 for every 100 points), I could theoretically cash my 3,600 points in for a $36 dollar gift card. So I spent $1,200 and received a reward of $36. That is a 3% reward rate. That is a whole percent better than the cash back! If my spending leaned even more towards just restaurants (fast food included) and textbooks (Amazon included), that rate would be even better.

**Don’t Worry**

Lastly

It’s actually advantageous for your to have a couple of credit cards open because your credit score takes into account the credit limit of all your credit cards and adds them together. At the same time

Don’t worry if you’re denied from a credit card when applying for your first. You probably don’t have much of a credit history for credit card companies to work with. Also, but when you’re trying to get your first credit card the effect is negligible. In summary, don’t worry about applying to a few credit cards if you get denied the first couple times. Just don’t apply for like 10 cards. Take it one a time.

Focus on building great credit history early and the benefits you receive from having a good credit score will outweigh a percentage point here or there.

1361488019.0,18zgci,"(US) Let's talk retirement taxes, fees, and penalties! (Roth vs Traditional)",RedRedditRabbit,114,94

I've noticed more and more people here in this forum blindly suggesting to people that they should max out a Roth account instead of contributing to a traditional retirement account. It seems that a lot of those that are suggesting Roth accounts don't understand the tax implications

In most cases, they are taxed at your average rate.

#Since your marginal rate is always higher than your average rate

###Let's do an example:

A single person is living on their own and making $50k salary. This person is trying to decide if he should contribute to a Roth IRA or contribute to his 401k. Fortunately this guy's 401k is managed by Vanguard

He's considering saving 10% of his income yearly

With the traditional 401k option,145 available to him for the year** ($50k - $4855 tax - $5000 in 401k).

After 40 years of investments making 5% interest, so he calculates that he can withdraw $31,140 yearly, and with a 3% interest rate on his account, his account will hit $0 right at the 30 year mark.

#Now, the money is taxed. $31,140 of income from a 401k account would be taxed $2775, **leaving him with $28,365 of yearly income.**

**Now let's make Roth IRA contributions instead.**

We need to make things fair, without the additional deduction from 401k contributions $50k of salary will be taxed $6095. This leaves us with $3760 to invest in the Roth IRA. You have the exact same income available to you ($40,145), but you can only contribute $3,760 per year.

#After 40 years of investments,417 available in your retirement account. Again, we would like this money to last us the next 30 years invested at 3%, so with some simple calculations we find that we can withdraw $23,417 yearly. Obviously, because this is a Roth account, there are no taxes that need to be paid,417.**

#The difference between these 2 is fairly staggering. In one scenario, which is $2363 a month. In the other you get $23,417 yearly, which is $1951 a month. **That's a difference of 20%! You'll have 20% more money available to you, every single year of your retirement, just by picking the correct retirement account to contribute into!**

##Taxes:

Another common topic that is brought up is the thought that taxes will rise in the future

Fear of increased taxes is perfectly understandable

Another possibility is that retirement could be taxed entirely differently. With a totally separate set of tax brackets for people that are withdrawing money from a retirement account instead of from paychecks

**The bottom line is that speculation on tax increases is exactly that. Speculation. You don't speculate with your retirement investments

##Fees and penalties:

A common selling point of Roth plans instead of 401k plans is that you can withdraw every dollar that you contributed without any penalties.

This is an excellent benefit to Roth plans

###Here's an example:

You're making a $50k salary, you're contributing to either a 401k or Roth IRA monthly ($5k and $3760 respectively). 3 years into your career your roof collapses, your car's engine seizes, and you trip and break your ankle. All on the same day.

You're going to be out of work for a while

Mr. 401k has $16, plus your full marginal tax rate on the money. Since we're out of work for 6 months we're only making $25k this year, so we're currently in the 15% marginal tax bracket. So we need to withdraw roughly $5k / 90% / 85% or $6535 in order to actually get $5000 in spending money. Now our retirement account is down to $9650.

Mr. Roth IRA has $12, so there are no taxes or fees assessed. He pulls $5k out and his retirement account dips to $7172.

**Both people pulled out $5000 in spending money from their accounts

This shouldn't be terribly surprising

Let's work for another 37 years (40 years total) and see how the two compare.

Mr. 401k has $580, and is hit with $2475 in taxes, leading to a retirement income of $26,665 yearly or $2222 monthly.

Mr. IRA has $436, or $1824 monthly.

Yet again, again, we have a difference of nearly 20% in favor of the 401k over the IRA contributor.**

##You can stop reading here if you don't want to math.

All of the calculations in the above examples were calculated in the following ways.

Taxes are based on Standard + Personal deductions for a single person with no children. No additional deductions were applied. Married filing jointly would follow the same patterns exactly with all monetary values doubled for the couple (aka it would be the same math for individuals) for the salaries we are talking about. Tax responsibilities wouldn't shift unless the individual is making over $85k yearly

Interest was calculated with monthly contributions and interest compounded monthly (ie, that has a 5% APY was compounded monthly at 0.4074%, leading to an account balance of $105 in January the following year).

Retirement withdrawals were compounded monthly at a rate of 0.2466% (3% APY) with regular monthly withdrawals of the yearly rate/12. There were not calculated as having single large withdrawals followed by a full year of interest. (Basically the same calculations as above

I'll provide any of these calculations that you may question to anyone interested. Just let me know.

##You can start reading again here

I am open for discussion on any of the assumptions I've made during this incredibly long post. Some of them may seem unintuitive, and due to all of the above math and examples, you should see that ever dollar you contribute to an IRA instead of a 401k is less efficient than just contributing to a 401k.

Okay so here is my situation:

**All the writing in italics is just background info which you can probably skip

*Straight out of school, because I was not doing well and did not like it that much. From there I was made into a Health and Safety Officer, where I done a few courses (WHSO course, plus a cert 4 in Health and Safety).*

*It was my first job, I decided to take out a loan for $20k and bought a car.*

*Later on that year I met a girl and we started dating. Fast forward 1.5 years and I lose my job due to a conflict with a manager (I decided to leave because working for family was creating tension and not working to well and one of the mangers there was making my life very hard). By this point I had $3000 worth of credit card debt due to stupid decisions and generally being an idiot with money.*

*I then moved to another small construction company as a laborer (really not my thing). Fast forward another year and due to stupidity / unforeseen circumstances / accidents / bills, I've moved in with my sister.*

**My debt situation:**

* Car Loan: $15
* Credit Card: $6500 - Repayments: $130 a Month - 19.74% P.A
* TV Finance: $1000 to go - Repayments: $80 a Month
* Ipad bill: $700 to cancel and pay out

**My other expenses are:**

* Rent: $80 a Week
* Fuel: $80 a Week
* Food: $80 a Week
* Phone: $86 a Month
* Internet/Home phone: $65 a Month
* Loan Insurance: $30 a Month
* Entertainment / Misc spending: $90 a Month
* Car Services: $200 a Quarter 
* Rego: $345 every 6 Months
* Car Insurance: Either $110 a Month OR $1200 a year (Due next month)

**Where I want to be**

My main goal is, each unit costs $480 and takes roughly a month to complete, however I can do it at my own pace and pay as I go, per unit.

I also really want to move out of my sisters house and move in with my girlfriend

* Cigarettes (Yuck I know): $50 a Week
* Extra Food: Total combined $100 a Week
* Her Phone: $50 a Month
* Electricity: $320 a Quarter
* Gas: $150 a Quarter

**My Income:**

I currently earn ~$800 a week. Sometimes its as low as $740

I do some work for friends family including mowing lawns

**My Plan Which May Be Terrible**

I currently have $4000 in the bank in savings. My plan is:

* Stay at my sisters another 3 months
* Pay off Ipads in Full this week for $700
* Pay off TV in Full this week for $1000
* Re-finance my loan this week up to $24900, repayments: $124 a Week
* Use money from loan to pay off and cancel credit card
* Use $2000 plus remaining savings ($2300) to pay for course
* Ask my parents / my girlfriends parents if they will help us pay for a bond on a new cheaper unit (Currently my girlfriend pays $340 a week, so I don't have to worry about paying it monthly)

So what do you guys think? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm actually heading off to bed now because I have work tomorrow

They are barely hanging on as it is. They live check to check, but lately it's gotten worse. Their only car broke down for good recently (they need a car for their job), and they had to borrow $2200 from me to buy a used car, money that I'm not holding my breath on them being able to repay.

I'm fortunate enough to have a high-paying part time job and a live-in boyfriend who is also a working student, and I know one medical accident would put me in ruin. They could just get a better paying job, but my dad has scoliosis (barely not severe enough to claim disability benefits), and can't do any work that requires lifting or sitting for long amounts of time. Plus he's an asshole with huge untreated emotional issues, so there's no reasoning with him or getting him to change his lifestyle, financial or otherwise. The man doesn't even know the difference between a debit card and a credit card, and when I try to explain it to him

My mom's looked into getting food stamps and other services

So basically, whether that's by providing them housing or something else. If nothing else, I will definitely be providing for them when they get too old to run a daycare. Is there anything that I can do to make this more comfortable for everyone? As much as I would love to just cut them off and tell them to deal with it themselves, I don't think I could live with myself. We live in California if that helps.

Does anyone else feel this way?,,99,17,109,"I've searched and read through a lot of the student loan threads across multiple subs and wanted to point out something I think has been missing from the discussion

**Some background about me:** I graduated with a worthless degree from a state college. My mom had saved enough to pay for the first year of university, I made all my own food, I took the bus. The usual.

I had a 25 hour-a-week job for the last two years of school

I make $35k a year and I live well, etc. My school loans are around $600 a month, more than my rent or any other bills.

In all, loans, rent, utilities and gas I'm left with about $150 a month extra, but that's on paper. Go to a movie, take a girl out for dinner and that's quickly gone. Basically, that's an entertainment budget.)

Before we go any further, so don't complain about them."" (my own dad tells me this).

My parents told me I had to go to college. It wasn't an option. Even further

You see, at 24, I don't know if I'm much better. I should not have been allowed to make that decision. My parents put the blame on me, but they raised me. They know how poorly I made choices. Taking life-altering loans out at that age is so awful, I can't believe normally rational people justified it so thoroughly.

The fact is, but it doesn't have an appropriate weight in their brains. It's a fault in logic for all the naysayers. (Although that won't stop anyone from commenting as such, I'm sure.)

**Psychological weight of student debt:** For those of us saddled with student debt who happened to back their way into a job like me

If I lose my job, I'm screwed. If the tax structure changes in any way, I'm screwed. If I get a moving violation and my insurance goes up, I'm screwed. If I get kicked out of my house for some reason and living expenses go up at all, I'm screwed. I'm teetering on the balance.

Mostly, I have to have a net positive income from where I sit now in order not to default on my loans. If I have one misstep, it's over. This is the biggest issue for me.

I'm missing out on $600 a month that could go in my pocket. But I'm young and poor. I've never had that kind of disposable income

Really, I could be unequivocally screwed. No bankruptcy, no loans, higher deposits, no car, wage garnishment. My life would be miserable.

I realize that many people can't pay their student loans and have both financial and psychological stress about that. You are worse off, it would be worse if it already fell).

In regards to the title question

My hypothetical person graduates college in 1980 at the age of 22 with no debt and no savings,000 in 2011 dollars, the national average salary for recent college graduates). He receives a raise every year of 2% above inflation, and retires December 31, 2011 at the age of 53 with a final salary of $67,591.

He begins his career by saving a modest 10% of his salary. Every year he increases his savings by 1% until 1986 when he stops at 15%. Then, he increases his savings to 25% for the last 10 years of work.

This person follows a very basic plan for his retirement accounts. Starting in 1981, on Jan 1, he rebalances his portfolio (and adjusts his contributions) to have 1% more in bonds. Finally, in 2011, he holds a 50/50 split for the remainder of his retirement.

I averaged yearly returns into a monthly breakdown, while allowing for natural monthly contributions like a normal worker would make.

Using the SSA retirement calculator

In conclusion, after dieing at the age of 100, leave an account to his children with $2,972,487 in it ($740,918 in 2012 money).

I am 30 years old and I do not like where my life has stalled out at. I work as a collector, money is not everything and since the recession the industry has really lost its luster.

Upon reading a post on here a few days ago, as collections (at least where I work) does not have a retirement package for its workers. Every day it gets worse at my job, and I'm fairly close to snapping, because I feel like I've settled and not made any strides toward my real goals in life. 

So, not after I graduated, but right then and there. I won't go into the specifics because it's quite boring, but suffice it to say that instead of doing what I wanted (or at least what I THOUGHT I wanted to do) at the time, I went right into the work force at 19 and have been there since, having paid absolutely zero on my loans because I've lived on my own, living check to check. I dated a girl who lived with me for four years, one of the reasons she rightly left me. She moved out

Well, maybe a one bedroom. Today, while telling my mother this same thing, she asked me to come live her and pay everything off and go on to do big things like she's always known I would. She's also struggling as a divorcee taking on the mortgage by herself. I'd also be spending a lot of time fixing up her house, and providing my brother with much needed companionship, which he is very much lacking in a small town where all of his friends have gone on to college and moved away. 

The way I look at it, and then return to school to get a degree.

I am 21, and am much more disciplined than most Americans with my money(the main exception being food/eating out/groceries). 

I have always dreamed of being a ""business owner"" (that was my childhood word for self-employed) and it feels great to be my own boss and to not have conformed to the parts of the ""American dream"" I don't subscribe to (namely,  while watching the market to sell at the RIGHT time. Overall I feel this is a lower-risk investment type, and it doubles as my housing. The third main benefit is that it would allow me more space to meal plan and keep leftovers (I currently have limited fridge/kitchen access). Plus, if I choose to re-locate I could just rent out the property. 

I know for sure I want to move out of the room I rent now. But, bbq, gym). 4) I generally prefer a smaller spaces (or, as small as is functional and cozy) and do not believe that biggest is the best in this case. I have to clean and maintain the thing after all, so as small as possible! 5) The property tax will help lessen my tax burden...my 1099 last year was 80k and being single with no dependents and few deductions.....that hurt!!! 

My main concerns are: 1) America's economy fails and I have to hold onto the property longer than planned (3-5 years, but am locked in to living in the property for 2 years due to FHA financing. (in this case, I could sell, if the market is right..which, who's to say?) NOTE: I expect, should my situation change I would still easily be able to afford my mortgage so long as I could keep tenets at all times (20% vacancy is average in suburban areas, correct?) So it is not the cost that worries me as much as the lack of mobility/freedom. 3) I decide purchasing is the right move

-----------------------

###Do you think I am ready? What questions can I ask myself in reflection to help decide for myself whether or not this is the right move at the right time?

##IF YES: 
**What are good investment features to look for in a condo? So far I have:**
 Location (near schools, low crime rate); having a balcony or patio; community amenities; having access to parking (garaged is best, then covered then outdoor, with guest space availability being another factor); having laundry in-unit; the owner vs renter population of the complex; and lastly the CC&amp;R bylaws (how strict etc.)
**Are condos as good of investments as homes?** If this varies by area
**Which is easier to rent out** in full (meaning the whole condo vs the whole home)? Which would be easier to sublease as a live-in landlord: 2 extra rooms  in a Condo

##IF NO: 
**What are other good alternatives to real estate, so I ""have the time to risk"" I suppose, but I am not sure where life will take me and a Condo could be rented out should I choose to re-located etc.

We currently offer a 2% match whether the employee chooses to invest or not and its vested after 90 days. I talked to him about possibly changing this to be a little more generous

I asked him about the expense ratio fees on our account and he got very nervous and sort of angry all of the sudden. He said that the fees depend on whether the employee chooses ""A Shares"" or ""C Shares"" and that they range from 1.35%(A) to 2.05% (C). Reading through the Vanguard info it sounds like we are getting ripped off pretty good by these people but I wanted to make sure I wasn't overreacting. 

When I asked him about Vanguard, there were other problems with them. He couldn't name any of the problems, but he said they were there. 

Any other small business owners out there want to weigh in? Did I miss something with this guy? Or should we consider switching retirement accounts?

The courts made the following ruling:

* The ex owes my wife $70k
* My wife continues to pay her half of the mortgage until the house sells
* Any changes or decisions about the house must be made together

Before I met my wife, 5+ years later. We’ve driven by the house and it appears the ex-husband is either living in or renting the house. There has been some construction and improvements done on the home, all of which have been done without the consent of my wife; we don’t really care either way.

We called the bank and the loan is in good-standing

my friend and i signed the lease on an apartment a few months ago.  the lease is written so that we both are responsible for the total cost of rent, starting on the second day we moved in.

so i was paying half while they each paid 1/4. i told them that would not fly and he needed to pay 1/3. he agreed. next month

they haven't paid a single bill on time

they would both come home trashed 6 nights a week and just scream at the top of their lungs about whatever the hell made them angry that night ""FUCKING NIGGERS ACROSS THE STREET TALKING LOUD"" like

she got her boyfriend a dog for christmas. the dog lives with us

recently, i can move out and help my grandma with rent and drive her to and from the hospital and help her around the house while she recovers. then, i can get some peace and quiet so i am able to study and sleep.

she works 30 hours a week, even going full time if they want. neither of them are in school, nor do they have hobbies that they spend time doing outside of work. they simply sit at home and watch tv all day and get drunk. they are unwilling to add more hours on to their schedule even though they struggle to come up with rent every month.

I moved in with my grandma a month ago, and even though i should only be paying 1/3 if i was living there. 

**START READING HERE IF YOU WANT TO SKIP THE BACK STORY**

i have 3 options. 
1. i pay $1500 to break the lease. this would require her to agree
2. i continue to pay rent and risk her not coming up with her part of it (VERY likely. i have had to save her ass several times on rent) and have my credit be shit on
3. i don't pay a cent more and have my credit shit on (because i think that will likely happen anyway)

i am 20 years old, are there other repercussions that i am not thinking about? will the leasing office sue us and force me to pay or just evict her?

STILL TL;DR
what happens when you quit paying rent?

So, will building up credit over the next year allow me to apply for a loan next year, or is that just not enough time to build credit? I am very new to this and have always been kind of scared of having a credit card, so I'm sorry if that question seems very naive. 

Secondly, it is even realistic for me to be thinking about buying a home next year. I live in New England where home prices are not exactly cheap, but I've been trying to shop around and get an idea for what's out there, and there is a small but significant number of homes available for under $150,000, which is what I imagine would be the absolute peak of my budget, if that.

Thank you in advance for any advice you can offer! I love this subreddit and thank you guys for all your help. 
 

EDIT: I should also mention that apartments around where I live are pretty expensive, it makes more sense to save my pennies and invest in something of my own rather than throw that money into someone else's property. Plus, that's more than half of my take-home pay, which would leave me totally strapped. I would rather save up for a down-payment and then have a more manageable mortgage payment, but believe me when I say that I am new to all of this and really have no idea what I'm doing, so feel free to tell me if that plan sounds completely idiotic. 

Thank you!

Around 2 months ago he got a pay day loan and he recently just paid that off. But a week after he got that loan he had another company deposit $200 into his account and then proceed to debit money from his account every week. He didn't notice the initial deposit because it happened on the day he got paid. So they continued to debit money from him every week and when he had no money in his account they called him threatening to have him arrested if he didn't pay it. They gave him some B.S. reason saying it would have been considered a bad check. So he made a payment arrangement with them and they said they would take $20 out every week. Then he noticed they started taking it out twice a week. 

So I did some research on this company and it definitely looks like a scam. They deposit money into peoples after they steal their information from a third party and then they scare them into paying the loan bank and then some.

- I would gain vacation time, etc. I still get paid overtime

- The work I will be doing as a salaried employee isn't on the same level as that of what I was brought on to do when I was originally hired. I was hired to basically proofread documents

- My salary is noticeably lower than that of the low end salary for analysts (according to glassdoor)

- I have a really good working relationship with my manager

I guess my only hesitation is that in this market I don't particularly want to rock the boat at my place of employment. I am super excited to begin working as a real employee

What should I do? Should I address this to my manager?

What should be the tone of my response? By phone, email, or certified mail? In California, the Fair Debt Collection Practice applies to original creditors as well as debt collectors.

I am permanently disabled

I really hate being dependent on people and finally just secured my driving license. I went through a state program to train on hand controlled vehicles and will soon start the process to get a modified vehicle. 

DRS/State will pay for the modifications to the vehicle

The van cannot be more than 5 years old. I could purchase used

I’m not sure what I can afford now, gas, maintenance) but I’m also worried what might happen with the process of getting a modified vehicle if I stop in the middle of it. Everyone knows how state bureaucracy can be. 





#Breakdown:

Income: $735 every 2 weeks.

This is after all my insurance is taken out. Plus $30 for Flex account for medical expenses

Current Expenses:

Rent: $200 (Still live with my family)

Phone: $150 – I pay for my brother’s as well which is why it’s so high. I am working on getting him off. I can’t just shut it off because he is my ride everywhere and I need to be able to get a hold of him. I already downgraded his phone.

Car: $100 - (car bought from family member

Student Loan: $350 monthly. 32K in total.

Savings account: $2707.61 - $200 is taken out biweekly.

Discover - $1
Monthly Min: $50

Chase     - $2
Monthly Min: $42

Best Buy  - $233.32
Monthly Min: $35  

Retail - $1, cheaper alternatives
Monthly Min: $65

Care Credit (Dentist) - $1
Monthly Min: $42

Netflix: $8 monthly

I cancelled Audible/Various Game Subscriptions. Except Netflix.




I am finding it hard to estimate my various medical bills that crop up. Originally I had a Flex spending account to help with them. I used the whole $750 up by April. They aren’t consistent and can range from $30 - $400 per bill. Starting in September I qualify for Medicare B. Which has a cost of 106 per month. I am hoping this will help with the burden of my medical bills but I’m not sure yet how much of the bills they will help with after my primary (Blue Cross/Blue Shield) covers. Is this a good option? I have Combined Insurance to cover ime n case I get  hospitalized




Next year should I take out more for my Flex account? Since it is withdrawn before taxes are applied. Thankfully I am fairly stable medically




I know I can apply for a reduced student loan payment based on income




Summary of questions


• Can I afford a vehicle? Used? New? How can I make this happen?


• Should I apply for reduced student loan payments?

• How do I budget for my always changing medical bills?

• Should I take out more on the Flex account in 2014?

• Should I use all of my savings to pay off credit cards? If so which ones first?

• Any other good advice for reducing my overall bills?



I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this.


Edit: Thank you for the replies so far! To clear up confusion. The $735 is net take home. This is after my medical insurance/dental/ FSA and 401k are deducted. 

My degree is in graphic design/ animation. and I live in Northern Illinois

1361142447.0,18psb9,I am hemorrhaging money,dreiter,95,27,135,"First, what do I do?"" post.  I know this community gets a lot of these

Quick back-story.  My fiancee (who I love very much) and I work the same jobs,000 in student loan and car debt, and I am $30,000 in student loan debt. We both work at the same job, a job that we both hate, and we currently work ~80hrs per week.

My fiancee is planning our wedding, and our wedding rings were $3500, putting the total due at $20,000 by July.  I am putting in about $11500 of this, $2000 of it on an interest free credit card.  Frankly, the $20k is more than I wanted to spend, but after looking at the price of most weddings/honeymoons/rings around the country, and I didn't really feel I could say no to such a beautiful and important day for the love of my life.

A further large complication is my mother.  She is 48 years old,000 in defaulted credit cards.  She just graduated with her degree in Business Administration, but she has been unable to find employment.  She is getting kicked out of her home in the next few months.  I currently send her $300/mo, and she is begging me to take out a mortgage on a cheap home in my area (~$80,000) for her to live in.  I don't want to have to do this, but I also don't want my mother (who I love very much and raised me on her own) to be homeless.  I have no siblings that can help with the situation.  My fiancee is against me taking out a mortgage for my mother.  My fiance is also against living with my mother (we live in a small apartment and have no room for my mother and her pets, plus she is quite challenging to live with).

Perhaps this is just a long ramble and there really are no great choices to be made

**EDIT:**
Thanks to everyone for the great comments.  My fiancee and I had a long talk, no gifts.  We anticipate getting about $4000 in wedding money, of which we are putting 100% towards debt. We are also cutting down on personal spending leading up to the wedding, which should save $200/mo.  Lastly, we are going to try to cut $1000 out of our wedding expenses.  All of this will cut our new total down to $11500, which is an OK compromise to me.  
I am going to start paying my mothers rent ($375/mo) while she continues to look for a job, so I can live with that for now.  Thanks again for the thoughtful ideas!

1361022136.0,18mxoq,Question about $1.45 late fee being submitted to collections without ever sending me a paper bill or email,phozacle,93,21,48,"Last summer, it looks like for whatever reason (a website error?) I payed the billing amount minus the late fee ($95 instead of $96.45). 

Fast forward 6 months: Last night I visited my old utility account online for some unrelated reason. And on the front page, ""data unavailable: this account is in collections."" Now, to reset my password I had to enter the email address associated with the account, so I know that they know how to reach me by email at least. They also certainly have my phone number, because to access my billing information via phone (they're out of office till Monday), I had to verify the cell number associated with my account. So even if there was some mail forwarding issue, I think I should have been notified of this mysterious overlooked late fee before they sold the debt to collections. But I spent 2 hours going through every bill or remotely official communication I've ever gotten at the new house (I save them all)

I have also failed to receive any information from a collections agency yet. So I have no idea what's going on. Warren Buffett

EDIT: I wrote this in anger and wasn't clear. I am absolutely going to pay it as soon as I find out which agency has the debt and/or call the utilities company on Monday. In case it wasn't obvious. I'm not going to refuse to pay a $20-something debt ($1.45 + other fees

Create budgets from tags: Currently you can only create budgets using the categories. While you can create your own categories

Hide categories so they don't show up in the list: ability to trim the list of expenses. There are some things that never come up

Create ""budgets"" for savings: Mint Canada doesn't have the goals feature, inside mint, the amount of money I want to save in particular accounts as an incentive to do so (also the line should be red then yellow then green when you hit your monthly savings ""budget"")
 
Introduce the goals feature in Canada: as mentioned above

(Another Canada thing) Add the ability to pull info from the NSLSC (National Student Loan Service Centre) website. This has been mentioned in Mint's forums for years now with not much explanation given why it isn't included. I still have my loan in under a manually entered as a ""property"" that I have to edit every time I make a payment but that should be unnecessary.  
  
Be able to categorize accounts manually: My TFSA account shows up as an ""investment"" account and it won't allow me to change it to a simple savings account.

Secondly

Background: Currently I'm a Wells Fargo (previously Wachovia) customer who has been unhappy with the change over. In my case

Pros: No minimum balance. USAA doesn't have branch locations per se (a few) but instead allows you to use a smartphone or scanner to deposit checks to your account [EDIT: Per BeaconSlash's comment below I called to double check and there are qualifications to use the deposit@home feature - you must already have insurance or loan through USAA] or if you want to make a physical deposit you can do so at any UPS store. Their online bill pay is awesome. They will issue physical checks for free (you pay $6 for shipping though). The account is interest bearing on balances above $1000 (not much but still). They allow you to use any ATM at no charge and will refund the reciprocal bank's ATM fees up to ten times a month. No flat service fees. 

Cons: No physical presence for branches. That's it. 

The kicker is their customer service. No other company I've dealt with (except maybe Thinkgeek.com) has the level of customer service these guys have for credit cards, or banking. None.

Below I wrote to a different subreddit who asked for this type of information. Hopefully it helps many of you here and saves you a lot of money and peace of mind.

Keep a check register and here is why...

Please

We live in a very convenient electronic age and we are all very spoiled on our electronics and screens. Unfortunately

Checks - non electronic items. Do not show up as pending. Checks post to your account the same business day they are deposited. Write down the check in your register

Debit Card - PIN purchase - will post the same business day the transaction is made. Think of PIN as you are making your payment to that merchant right then and there. You are sending your money to them.

Debit Card - Credit - This pathway, use PIN and save them money.

The trick to credit transactions is if the merchant does not submit for payment the pending transaction will be removed by the website after a preset time. The reason it does this is because places like hotels will place a small hold on some funds

This does not mean they cannot collect. All it does is take it away from your history until either the merchant does collect or it never comes back if they never collect.

^ THIS is what fucks people up. Use PIN as much as possible unless you can't help it. I've seen it happen many times someone makes a ton of transactions

Please, and know the transactions you are making because you are making them. The website can only show you what it has been given.

Last reason...what if the bank is showing a balance that you have no idea why it would be lower than you thought it was? How do you prove they have incorrect information? A claim can dispute a transaction but if it doesnt go in your favor then what? If you keep a record you can use that information to assist you in a claim against a merchant or dispute incorrect information with your bank.

Why rely on someone elses records when it is YOUR money. Protect it. Teach your kids how to bank. We get the most money off of teenagers to thirty year olds all because they think their website is always 100% accurate.

So, if you have any 2.35% loans, it may be good to consolidate now (unless you are going back to school and could get them consolidated at an even lower rate of 1.5%).

If you have loans at 3.15% or 3.39%, the rates are pretty close to the lowest possible without Treasury yields going negative, so it's probably a good time to consolidate and lock in the low rates.

See [here](http://www.finaid.org/loans/scripts/interest.cgi) for more info on how the variable rates are calculated

**Edit:** [Here's](https://loanconsolidation.ed.gov/AppEntry/apply-online/appindex.jsp) the page to start working on your consolidation loan.

**Edit 2:** Since a lot of people are asking, 2006, this does not apply.  Also, private loans may have variable rates but are not eligible for federal consolidation.  It's really going to depend on your loan terms and what refinance/consolidation offerings private companies have to determine whether it would be worth if for private loans.

I don't want anybody to think that they'll be able to get their 6.8% loans down to 2.125%, but for people with these loans that won't pay them off by next July (when rates change again), consolidation may be a good option to lock in low rates.",,False,,1372876088.0,t3_1himne

Out of curiosity, these concerns are absolutely valid.

Credit repair has a really shaky past.  Instead of legitimately helping people take control of their score, there was 'Project Credit Despair' http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2006/02/badcreditbgone.shtm which tackled 20 agencies and shut them down.  In 2008, there was 'Operation Clean Sweep', which took down 36 additional credit repair organizations.

This isn't to say that scams no longer exist

To give you some perspective, and loans.  These people are generally surprised that they were denied for credit.  They've found the house that they've always wanted, and just had their dreams crushed by a denial.  I discuss with these people why they were denied, and I pull up a credit report with them to discuss their options.  On every call that I take, I clearly disclose that they have the right to do everything that we do for them on their own.  They are told of their legal right to challenge items on their credit reports that they feel are questionable or misleading.

However, we end up doing that process for them if they want us to.

The majority of people that sign up for any credit repair service with us are people who either do not want to spend the time doing it on their own

Anyone can do it on their own.  Anyone can dispute information on their own.  Anyone can challenge negative listings with their creditors on their own.  Anyone can try and remove inquiries on their own.  Anyone can drive down to the post office and certify every piece of mail that they send to the bureaus or creditors.  

You can also change the oil in your car on your own.  You can build your own computer.  You can fix a leaky faucet by yourself.  You can set up a new 5.1 surround stereo for your brand new HDTV by yourself.  For people who have no idea how to do those things

Doing things on your own that you don't do every day can be tricky.  If you do things on your own, don't feel less capable as a person for hiring someone out.

Telling someone that something isn't a good idea because they can do it on their own is just bad logic.  Your subject to your opinion

Lending Club will also assign a risk to the loans.  A through G.   A's have low interest rate, there is also another grade of 1-5.  A1 being the safest and a G5 being the most risky.

They provide all the statistics for basically anything you would be interested in

As a lender

If you choose to browse the loans, credit score, etc...   You basically look over the application and can even ask the borrower questions.  

I have fairly strict guidelines into what I invest.  I do a lot of debt consolidation.  I look for long history of credit, etc...   I also tend to only invest in loans around $5,000 and I only invest $25 in each loan.  Occasionally $50 if it looks really good.

I don't know) because they can't put both their names on the title, and I'm an only child, they wanted to put the title under my name instead of one of them. Their reasoning is that in case they pass away, they don't want their other siblings trying to take the property or something instead of me getting it. They also said because the property is ""provisioned out"" by the military (I'm not sure how exactly it works, but you can't just buy property straight up with money in China, at least for housing anyway, my grand parents were provisioned the right to purchase certain properties up to a certain size/location because of their military ranking or something). Anyways they say the rules are not favored for skip generation (my grandparents -&gt; me), I might not necessarily get the house when she passes away because the military/government would try to take it back or something. 

Anyways, I'll technically own a rather valuable property in China (It's a fairly big apartment close to downtown Beijing at a good location, they say it's probably worth ~$1million USD in the current market). It's already fully paid for, there's no mortgage, and apparently at least right now there are no taxes/fees that are required at all for owning it in China. My aunt will continue to live in the apartment, and me and my parents obviously whenever we visit china. Even if there are fees/costs coming up, my aunt and parents will handle it. I do trust them on that part

So

Will this affect anything at all for me

**Total Living Expenses: $630**  

Motorcycle Insurance: $110  
Auto Insurance: $100

*Note:  the strikethrough loans are the ones that qualify for my DMP

**Total Income: $7200**  
**Total Expenses: $6665**  

Now, the interest rate on Payday Loan #1 would be reduced to ~12%, while the other cards would be dropped to ~6%-10%.  

My payday loan balances are only dropping slightly with the minimum payments (as expected)

If I make it through the beginning of January, as well as RSUs in my company vesting in May 2014.  

Right now, while looking at the bigger picture (future) with hope that things will be getting better if I can just suck it up in the short term.  (I am also looking at other subreddits that were suggested to try to bring in extra income/do consulting/and have successfully used ""comps"" at the casinos where I stopped gambling.  Furthermore, I am still receiving promotional mailers that I've used to walk in, get free cash (~$120 a month), and walk out.  I also have a lot of food comps, so I am using those as well...  

Given that, and/or some other emergency expense comes up (car repair, health expense not covered by insurance, roommate leaves), I believe my only option will be to file for bankruptcy.

If requested, but am not sure if I would be able to remain anonymous.  (One of the unfortunate implications of this is the stigma from my social circles if they were to find out my own stupidity/addictions got me into a financial mess...  They are already noticing that I have avoided going out with them for a while now...)

So here's the background...

 * According to Experian
 * The first item is my *""report doesn't show any usable/valid real estate loans, not just a home).  I still rent, but am still saving aggressively towards a home (probably would put 40-50% down, so it's taking a very long time to save this).  So I can't address this any time soon.  
 * The second item is *""your report shows that the available credit across your open, is too low""*.  Recently I had three credit cards opened in 2002, 2003 and 2005.  The total available credit across them was ~$15,000.    I've since looked at how I could save more money via rewards programs and opened an AMEX Blue Cash Preferred which has a $15,000 limit itself, raising my total available credit to $30K.  
 * The third item is *""your report shows that the time since your oldest revolving account, but during the financial crisis Capital One decided to close it on me for whatever reason.  I protested it, but I think it was to limit their potential exposure, even though at the time I think my FICO score was in the 750-760 range.  I told them that I wished their children died in a car fire.
 * The fourth item is *""your report shows that the ratio of balances-to-credit-limits across your open revolving accounts, then make a balance transfer (at 1% of the balance, which negated the 1% rewards) to another card to have it at 0% for the year, so I could pay it off over the year to keep cash flow smooth. Got no rewards in the end, but eliminated the interest.  Now all balances are $0 (or have a slight credit). I run everything through the AMEX for the rewards (6% for supermarket/prescriptions, 1-3% for everything else) and pay off the balance **weekly**.  I have some expensive purchases planned (still furnishing), but I plan to just use the card and pay 50% of the balance a week after the charge hits the card so keep the ratio low (I have 0% APR for another 11 months).

Dad took early retirement in 2007

Nowadays he still tries to plug away at the business and make it work, my mom's got too many health issues to physically function at a 9-5 retail job.

I love my parents


The nitty-gritty details of my parents' finances

* Combined average income: $1200

* Money I give them: $1500

* Mortgage: -$1300

* Bare necessities cost of living (food, electric, etc.): -$1000

* City Card min. payment (18% interest rate): -$150

* Chase min. payment (16.2% interest rate): -$225

* Bank of A. min. payment (9.9% interest rate): -$385

* Add that all up together and you get -$270. Lovely.

* Also

Ok

I'm newly married,000 a year with her job, and currently she reports that she's saved $30,000 over the past couple years, so I figured that we have a good emergency fund. Also, she gets to save a substantial amount, so that makes her happy and it gives me a little comfort to know that we've got it in case everything goes to shit.

I worked out our budget for 2013

* I have no debt.

* I can continue to give my parents $1500 a month.

* On top of that

* On top of that,000 leftover to do what I will. My wife had said maybe we should combine it with her savings, but I think she'd be fine if I used some or all of it on my parents too.


So before I get to options

1. I trust my parents. They're not gambling, then the economy went bust. As for the $200k house, possibly a bad move, but again, they couldn't have predicted 2008.

2. My parents are very good at being frugal. They don't buy anything extravagant. They don't eat out. My mom cooks cheap

3. The house is a tough one. They've got $148k left on it. The house has depreciated so much in value that me and my dad both think that if it sold right now, which sucks, because we both thought he could get the payments down to $900ish.

4. They don't have health insurance

5. Like I said before, and will continue to do so until they get back on their feet. I'm in this for the long run, so that means our finances our linked, basically.


Ok

* Pay off the high interest credit cards

* Ditch the house. Not sure that it's a good idea

* I've thought about just using the Roth IRA money to help pay off credit debt. I mean, I'm always going to be helping them out if they need it), then doesn't it make sense to treat their credit card debt as if it were mine, since I'll end up paying it one way or another eventually? Also, my wife's got some savings going on, so me waiting one more year won't make a big difference in the grand scheme of our savings.

* I live outside the US

* Bankruptcy? I have no clue what it would entail. My dad has an accountant

* My mom had to go to the emergency room this past summer,000. They would've just cleared it all, but they looked at my dad's bank account and saw that I'd given him $30k over the past couple years and they said it counted as income. Should I just buy them costco gift cards and stuff like that as a way to supplement their income in case this ever happens again?

* I could try and get a personal loan from one of the banks around where I live for hopefully 6.6 percent or so. If I can get it

Here are the debt totals:

mortgage $148, 25 years left

City Card $8

Chase $9

Bank of America $20

Hospital,  0% ($350 for 36 months, but they're trying to still work this out to see if they can get it reduced)

First and foremost please don't need any judgement please. I'm just trying to get a bit of information to make sure I'm going in the right direction.

**background story**
I was in the Army for 5 years stationed over in Seoul

I then went and started school in '11 and the military was paying for it through my GI bill

During the time I was in school I was motivated in the beginning...then about 6 months after I just got depressed. I have no clue what led to it but I just picked up my little bit of shit and left. Didn't withdraw or anything, and a roommate and we tried to do some small business stuff on the side that did not work well. I didn't pay any debts during this time ('11 - '12). I had a girlfriend as well that I kept totally out of the loop. All the while the school was charging me money that I didn't know about for not withdrawing before I left. During this time I racked up about 10k in tuition to the school before I finally was contacted about it. I immediately told them I obviously wasn't coming back and to withdraw me because I didn't want any more charges. The school didn't contact me to pay until later.

1. Can the school really charge me like that? If I didn't attend any class and I was obviously not attending any...they can just keep tacking on the tuition because my name was on the roster? (The school was FullSail in FL)

So this is the beginning of '12 and I decided to make a change. My girlfriend and I decided to move back to her hometown and start trying to save and get our finances in order. Well really she wanted to go back home and I wanted to get MY finances in order. So we did. I withdrew my 7k from the TSP that I saved and used that to move. I got a job and didn't save shit. We spent everything on getting our apartment somewhat furnished. After about 6 mos I quit the job, and decided I'd go back to school. So going back to school I started getting the GI Bill stipend again and that was fine but it still wasn't cutting it. So now I have another job and i'm going to school.

1. How do I find out everyone I owe money to?
2. Which debts should I forget about and which debts should I pay? If the debt is X yrs old should I just forget about it like I have been?
3. Since some of the debts were incurred when I was in Kansas is the statute of limitations from that state or what?

**Goals**

1. Save up an emergency fund.
2. Save for a car.
3. Save for a home.
4. Save for retirement.

**Income**

* Paycheck = $1280 /mo

* GI Bill  = $380  /mo

* Rent     = $150  /mo

**Expenses**

* Rent         = $200 /mo

* Mobile Phone = $100 /mo

* Utilities    = $130 /mo

* Internet     = $55  /mo

* Groceries    = $200 /mo

* Gas          = $100 /mo

* Car Ins.    = $150 /mo

**Possible Expenses**

* Fast Food    = $90

* Restaurants  = $50

* Shopping     = $100

* Gaming       = $25

* Hair         = $35

With all this laid out I have started to get myself out of spending money going out, this is the first month that I've put this budget into effect and it reflects only my portion of the expenses. We split everything 50/50 almost exactly. 

So

Just basically any advice you have PF I'm all ears.

**edit**
I just went over my credit reports and they're all pretty much the same. I created a list of all the debts where the account weren't labeled as closed. Just for ease of use I also put the date the account was created and went into collections.

**CC Debt**

* Amex (opened 4/10 status: CO) - 817
* Cap 1 (opened 8/08 status: CO)- 1551

**Util Debt**

* Westar (opened 7/10 status: C) - 394
* Cox cbl (opened 11/10 status: C) - 119
* Comcast (opened 7/11 status: C)- 192

**School Debt**

* FullSail    (opened 4/10 status: OK)- 10000 &lt;---- will begin paying
* Great Falls (opened 2/08 status: C)- 3000
* VA Debt     (opened 4/10 status: OK)- 8079 &lt;----paying

**Misc Debt**

* Ashley Furniture (opened 5/10 status: C)- 6982
* Apt              (opened 10/12 status: C)- 468
* Medical Bill     (opened 4/13 status: C)- 333

Total Debt = **31

This is much more than I thought it was and a bit unnerving. Should I pay the Charge Off accounts or just pay the stuff in collections?

**edit**

After doing a small bit of simple math I've come up with the following. If I put all ""leftover money"" into paying my debts each month then I should be able to get **free** in 36 months.

Total Income - $1810 /mo

Total Expenses - $935 /mo

After Expenses - $875 /mo

Total Debt - $ 31.935

To pay off - $31

Our school gives us a free consultation with a physician financial planner

**Income Background**

Here is a breakdown of my projected income. The income for the next three years during residency is estimated but at least that amount. The income for the 4th year is dependent on whether or not after I graduate I pursue a year of additional training or start working:

* Year 1: $44
* Year 2: $49
* Year 3: $54
* Year 4: either $250
* Year 5+: $250

My partner will be making slightly more than I will during residency (she is also graduating medical school and will be starting residency),000 and we plan to pay those off as soon as is feasible. My loans are more difficult, because since the amount is higher there are more options due to the possible advantage of income-based repayment.

**Question 1: Loan repayment options.**

My planned career path will leave me eligible for the public service loan forgiveness, and make 120 consecutive payments (10 years) starting the first month of residency, I will be making 36 payments of about $400 and the rest of the payments after training will be about $2,500 a month. At the end of the 120 payments, I will have paid about $180,000 for my loans and the rest will be completely forgiven.

* Pros to IBR: able to live more comfortably in residency and have the opportunity to start investing early (Roth IRA in low income bracket) due to smaller monthly loan payments and allows me to pay overall less money than I took out in loans if I do forgiveness
* Cons to IBR: will need to ensure that my employment is eligible for the public service loan program so cannot work in the private setting

The other option is income-based repayment during residency so I can at least keep the interest at bay and then just hammer down the loan as fast as I can after I graduate. The downside to this is I actually have to pay more money than if I did income-based repayment because I don't get any loans forgiven. The upside is that it's guaranteed to happen and I can work wherever I want.

**Question 2: Investments during residency.**

We have made a budget and found that we will take in about $7, we should qualify for educational credits, and hopefully we can maximize our deductions to minimize our taxable income. We will likely be filing separately, as I believe the income-based repayment uses tax filings to determine how much I am required to pay, and filing jointly would decrease my loan payments and therefore increase my loan forgiveness at the end of 120 payments.

Our location has a high cost of living and we are both commuting (but both our cars are paid in full). The numbers below also represent the total joint expenditures for the both of us.

* Fixed expenses: rent $1700. loan repayment $1000. utilities $100. phone $100. insurance [car
* Variable expenses (groceries, entertainment, health): $1000

This leaves us with just under $2, we are pretty frugal people, cook almost 100% of our meals, do a lot of bargain hunting (craigslist/slickdeals/fatwallet) and do not typically spend frivolously. Disability insurance is a must because there are plans that lock you into a rate based on health and current income and do not change rates -- therefore, getting a rate locked in at age 25 with no medical problems and an income of sub-50,000 is very advantageous.

Now ""what to do with it"" is the difficult question. If I decide to do income-based repayment, and I would be at an income level where a Roth IRA would make sense and be beneficial, especially given the anticipated income jump. However, if I do not do income-based repayment, should I even bother putting a single cent in investment, or just put it toward my loans, since at least the first ten thousand I put towards them would be knocking down loans running at 7.9%.

I'm a lazy index-investor who hopes to retire very early on a pretty frugal lifestyle of ~$50k.  I married, but if you're not exactly in my situation, you might have to adjust/adapt a bit.

**tl;dr - Sorry I'm so long-winded.  I've put all the important stuff in bold.**

**EDIT** - I have been corrected on a substantial point (that doesn't happen to affect me much, so I'm pretty sure I was indeed wrong about after-tax earnings being tax-free during a rollover.  Sorry about that.

What Makes a Good 401k?
-------------------------
There are two kinds of 401k's.  The first kind, none of which are index funds, and all of which have expense ratios in the .8% to 2.5% range.  The second kind, which is becoming more common every day, offers all those same lousy options, plus 4 or 5 index funds with expense ratios that are as good as you can get at Vanguard, and sometimes even better (because they are institutional shares).  **Low-cost index funds are a sign of a good 401k plan.**

The second factor to look at is your employer match.  It is not uncommon for employers to match 50% of contributions up to 7% of pay, which is a sign of a good 401k plan.**  Even if your plan has lousy mutual funds with high expense ratios, the employer match might make it a better deal than investing in an IRA or a taxable brokerage account.  And remember, since you can roll the 401k funds into an IRA with low-cost index funds as soon as you leave the company (if not sooner), you won't be stuck with those high ERs forever.

Third, but are treated (along with their earnings) as ordinary income in retirement, just like a Traditional IRA.  Many 401k plans now allow Roth-style contributions, which are not tax-deductible, but are completely tax-free in retirement.  The question of whether **Roth or Traditional** is better depends on your particular situation, and is treated in the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/faq#wiki_roth_or_traditional.3F).  Many online sites make blanket recommendations that young people should do Roth, but it's not such a simple decision.  RedRedditRabbit explained many of the advantages of Traditional in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/18zgci/us_lets_talk_retirement_taxes_fees_and_penalties/) a while back.

In addition to Traditional and Roth contributions,500 in 2013, after-tax contributions have a different limit.  Specifically, the total of all 401k contributions (Traditional, Roth, after-tax, *and* employer match) can be as high as $51, and it is generally easier to withdraw after-tax contributions and their earnings before retirement.  **Plans that offer all three kinds of contributions offer flexibility that can help you optimize your taxes.**

Finally, I can't withdraw my Traditional or Roth contributions or their earnings, but I can withdraw my employer's contributions and earnings (on which I would owe tax unless I roll it into a Traditional IRA) and my after-tax contributions (on which I would owe no tax since I already paid tax) and their earnings (on which I would owe tax, unless I roll them into a Roth IRA).  **In-service withdrawals are especially nice if your plan has high ERs.**

Getting the Most from Your 401k Plan
------------------------------------
The first step to getting the most from your plan is to read your benefits information or call someone in HR and find out about your plan, contribution options, and withdrawal options, you'll need to pick investment options.  Here are a few things to keep in mind:

* **Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match.** I've run numbers for 5 or 6 people who thought they had *really* bad options (ERs as high as 3.5%) but all of them came out better getting the match than investing in an IRA.  You might be the exception
* **Low expense ratios are the single best predictor of fund performance.**  Resist the urge to compare funds based on past performance, but that doesn't mean the same one will perform best over the next 5 or 10 years.  Look for funds with low expense ratios.  Less than .2% is good, less than .1% is great.
* **Index funds are usually better than managed funds.**  Even if the ERs are the same (which is unlikely--index funds are usually much cheaper)
* **Apply your asset allocation to your whole portfolio, but all of its bond funds have high ERs, then you should hold all of your bonds in your IRAs and only large-cap US equities in your 401k.  If you are just starting out and don't have enough money in each account to do this perfectly, at least keep in mind that it's OK to be all-bonds in one account with a good bond fund and all-equity in another account with good equity funds.

Some Tricks for Early Retirement Planning
-----------------------------------------
This section might not be as generally applicable

The main concern I have with early retirement is ensuring I have enough accessible money to last me from when I stop working for money until age 60 when I can get at my IRAs.  If you are retiring ""just a little early"" at age 55 or so, you might consider giving up some employer match because that money would be ""locked up"" and you'll need as much as you can get in taxable accounts.  Fortunately, current tax law is full of ""loopholes"" that can make early retirement an option without giving up tax-advantages of IRAs and 401k.

The fundamental concept I plan on taking advantage of is that Roth *contributions* can be withdrawn penalty-free and tax-free at any time.  Only their earnings are locked up until age 60.  With a little planning

**Roth Conversions**

I live in upstate NY, I may move to a state with lower income tax.  Since I'll spend the first 20 or 25 years of ""retirement"" with no pension or Social Security income, the federal tax rate on $50k of Traditional distributions would be much less than my current marginal rate of 15%, since so much of it will be tax free (at least $10k of deductions and $19k of exemptions) and most of the rest will be taxed at 10% (currently around $17k).  But if I save in Traditional-style accounts, either 401k or Traditional IRAs, I can't get the money until age 60 (55 from the 401k if I don't roll it over).  The trick I plan on using is to convert about $50k of my Traditional savings to Roth each year, starting the year I retire.  I'll owe tax on that $50k, meaning I can pull it out of the Roth IRA before age 60.  Now, I thought this would be mostly taxable savings

**After-tax 401k Contributions**

**EDIT**- After-tax *contributions* can be rolled into a Roth tax-free, this means only the actual contributions can be withdrawn before age 60, so I might go back to plan A with the traditional conversion to Roth.

This is the thing that I just found out about today, because it is a huge increase to the contribution limits for Roth-style retirement accounts.  Basically, you take all the money you would have saved in a taxable account, and instead you make after-tax contributions to the 401k plan.  When you retire, you rollover all of those contributions ~~and their earnings~~ into your Roth IRA.  There is no tax or penalty at this point, and the entire amount counts as a contribution to the Roth.  ~~So if you contribute $30k after-tax to the 401k, it grows to $50k, you can get the whole $50k immediately.  This is better than taxable investing because you don't owe tax on any interest or capital gains like you would in a taxable account.~~  [corrected: If you are in a low tax bracket in early retirement, capital gains aren't taxed

Throwaway, single male, working full-time as a software engineer, making a decent salary.  I have amassed debt throughout college and graduate school, and was foolish in how I spent/managed debt.  To further deepen the debt, I was a compulsive gambler for almost a year, and took out payday loans, and screwed myself that way as well.  I am currently seeking therapy for depression

My credit is decent, but am not sure if this is sustainable long-term.

I've lurked on this subreddit for a while now, and focus on the best decisions from here on out, given my financial situation.  I am not looking for new loans/debt, and have not been able to qualify for any personal loans to consolidate.  I am also not at 80% LTV on my home, so equity loan/cash-out refinance is not really an option for me.

Another thing to note is that I am living paycheck-to-paycheck, I'd like to focus on my monthly cash flow/getting out of debt.  At this point, I think my best option is credit counseling, but wanted to see what you all thought.  My parents are not able to support me financially as they are having their own financial problems at this time.  I am very embarassed, and feel so foolish about my degenerate past, and have kept this to myself before speaking to my parents.  They are suggesting Chapter 13.

So much has been happening its difficult to remember it all! Once again I just want to reiterate how glad I am that I listened to all of you and did not purchase a house and cut my expenses. Just wanted to recap all that myself and my gf have done in the past month or so. 

Housing:

If you didnt read the original

My girlfriend and I have found a place to rent with some friends and heres the kicker.... Its a really nice couple that has included food and utilities into our rent! They have told us it is just as easy to cook for four of us that just the two of them as long as we pitch in some money. We get a whole floor of the house to ourselves! Our housing expenses (rent

Savings: $1300-$1500 / month

Job:

I was able to score the same job  I am doing now but on a different shift for roughly a $6 an hour raise! Also this new shift will allow me to go back to school full-time and my employer will pay for it.

Increased earning: ($10-12k gross)


Savings/Retirement/Debt free goals:

Nothing major has changed here yet from the last post but after the move I am auto depositing the savings for the housing into my savings until I have 6 months emergency fund and then savings for a down payment on a house. We should be able to complete this goal of a 20% down payment in 3-4 years with maxing out my Roth IRA and my company match. Also

 

I hope my updates are an encouragement to people who think they cannot change their current situation. Admittedly

1369574967.0,1f2w3f,"So I want to save 550.000 bucks, but it takes way to long. Any advice? (DE)",seeking550k,120,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1f2w3f/so_i_want_to_save_550000_bucks_but_it_takes_way/

First, insurance etc. I take home about 1800€ per month. Since I'm currently hunting for a new job, this will soon be around 2000€ per month.    
In my younger years I was a little stupid regarding expenses: Of course I needed a new computer
At least I didn't get into debt

Well, since I already owned lots of expensive stuff in the past and it didn't make me happy. (Thanks to /r/buddhism here!) But it makes me very happy if I have free time and can do whatever I want, from reading a book up to doing good stuff for others without expecting anything.    
I'd rather solve tomorrow's problems than programming boring business software: It's not about ""doing nothing""

Which brings us to today. Since I know my finances quite well

* 1800€ income after tax and deductions
* 590€ apartment rent and related stuff
* 50€ internet and mobile phone plan

That leaves us with 1160€. Since I have to commute in my current job, I broke down the yearly ones:

* 131€ car credit
* 8€ car tax
* 38€ insurance
* 90€ gas
* Repairs vary

Without repairs we have now 893€ left. Next up is the miscellaneous stuff - you might wonder about my high grocery bill

* 400€ groceries (more paleo-style than western-style)
* 90€ cash (haircuts
* 6€ personal liability insurance

Which leaves me with 397€. Currently I don't invest into anything

* 175€ go to a ""Bausparvertrag"" (uh
* 25€ go to a shared savings account with my girlfriend for holidays and stuff
* 25€ go to a savings account with bonuses after the 4th year (up to 50% after 20 years)

So there are 172€ left per month. From this money I need to buy stuff like clothes, this isn't very much.

**Now to my problem:** My combined assets are in the ballpark of just 7.000€ (minus my car credit). Since my savings are going steadily up and I have no immediate emergencies, have medical security and so on, but there's just no way to become rich in the next years.    
If my calculations are right, this is hopelessly unrealistic in my current situation ...

I already thought of a few ways to get there:

* Since I already sold the expensive stuff of the past
* As a software developer
* I could look for a new job to increase my income
* Decreasing my monthly payings is hard
* Currently I can't really ged rid of my car
* Relocation is theoretically possible, too. A slightly cheaper apartment close by might be possible, but I haven't found a livable one yet ...
* Buying a house or apartment would be possible with my above mentioned fully stocked ""Bausparvertrag"". Those things are expensive - 100.000€ for a small house
* I could get a bachelor's degree in a computer related field in my spare time. That would cost me about 15.000€, and it would eat up my spare time to do any other side-projects (see ""developer with spare time and no ideas"").
* The only way to significantly increase my income seems to be self-employment. This would cut out the mandatory expenses (insurance etc.) and allow me to maximize my hourly rate. But I fear this step because of the high bureaucracy and insecure future (25% have to quit after just three years).

So ... what would you suggest to ramp up my savings? What would work
Please keep in mind

Oh

I'm writing on behalf of a friend of mine. He's not a Redditor

Long story short, hence Wells Fargo for his savings. They talked him into some sort of combo account that gave him a savings and a checking account all umbrella'd together. He also specifically mentioned that he did not want or need ATM access, yet two weeks after opening the account, he received ATM cards, one of which he destroyed, the other he put into a safe. 

Fast forward a month, he discovered that someone had been writing fraudulent checks, transferring money from his savings to his checking account, and then running dozens of ATM, debit and check transactions against that checking account. Both accounts were now totally empty.

He called Wells Fargo and notified their fraud division, claiming that it must have been my friend or an authorized agent of his who engaged in the transactions.

In the course of the investigation

My friend contacted the LAPD with his story as well

The obvious solution is to lawyer up. But he's not really in a financial position to be able to do that. Just curious if anyone has a similar experience or could point to a direction that I could advise him. 

We're also curious as to how the thieves got access to his accounts - Clearly they needed a tremendous amount of information about him.

Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated. I don't have a clue how to advise him, and to have it just wiped out like that... man.

Thanks in advance.

My take on it?

**The Myth:**

401(k) loans are double taxed. First

**The Explanation:**

It doesn't matter that you are paying back the loan with post-tax dollars. I think the pdf linked to on the federal reserve website puts it best. 

&gt; Since loan proceeds are not taxed when distributed

Here are two examples

*case 1:* I take out a 401(k) loan of $5000 and then immediately pay it back, or free money I found in a safe I discovered in my deceased grandmother's home. I had a $5000 loan, and then I didn't. Isn't that simple?

*case 2:* I take out a $5000 401(k) loan and buy a used car on craigslist. I just bought a car with money that I didn't have to pay federal or state income taxes on. What sorcery is this!? Well

**But what about the interest?**

Again I think the federal reserve pdf puts it best:

&gt; Loan interest payments,
they should be made with pre-tax dollars and then taxed upon withdrawal. In practice
however
break borrowers get on the timing of their tax payments: recall that rather than paying
taxes on loan proceeds when they are distributed (i.e.
gradually over the following ﬁve years as they repay the loan with after-tax dollars. The
time value of these delayed tax payments oﬀsets the double taxation of interest—perfectly
so
lower.

I hope that helps clear up any misconceptions on the matter. There are certainly other reasons to not get a 401(k) [edit: loan]

I'm looking for a couple first steps I can take to wisely invest and save my money.  I've realized the first is to get my money out of a checking account

1. Open up a Roth IRA with Vanguard ($5
2. Max out my 401k contributions

After this, yet I don't fully understand what would happen to that money.  Any advice you could give me would be greatly appreciated.

Please help me plan my way out of it

**Edit 1: **
Thank you for all the replies guys.
I posted the thread just before midnight(AU) and went to bed. Just woke up to a surprise that so many of you had good suggestions.
I'll try to answer all the queries a bit more:

* **Dhukuti situation:**
15 close friends make a group
At the end of month, if anyone is interested, I can explain further)
Like everyone would have imagined
But the organiser gets the money first, no one tries to screw over anyone else), organising tender to decide who wins and things alike.
I took the money on the second month and paid more than half of my personal loan. It was a $15k to start at 16% variable loan
The remaining $10k is the 10 instalments I need to pay for next 10 months for the dhukuti, but I don't want to be a bad friend.
I knew it would be hard for me to involved in dhukuti

* **Studyroom situation:**
I'm a system admin at one university. This is my first job out of university, in my study room, I have 10 cisco routers/switches, 6 HP servers, 5 workstations. This is my personal lab, where I test everything that I come across/read about.
I think what I'm getting from my current job is way too less for the skill I give them. That's the reason I am thinking of getting another job(which hopefully will be little high paying as I have enhanced my skills/expertise). Recently was offered a job in Amazon Web Services through LinkedIn
I understand there is a huge saving if I can rent out that study room

* **Girlfriend situation:**
Due to some visa reason, it is little different than you guys think. She will help to pay the debt with everything she earns(what I earn and what she earns, we combine it. There is no such thing as my money or her money), and I can decide where to spend. I think paying for your GF for 10-12 months to help her at hard times is reasonable. She is looking to get another part time job, and also talking with the employer to make the current job a full time one. I just talked to her about renting another room, and she says lets see for 1-2 week if the employer gives her full time, or if she finds another part-time job.

 **Things I'm doing to cut cost:**


* I'm moving to $30pm no contract plan on my phone. I'll buy the SIM card today.
* I'll need Internet as I need to check server status and things from home. Also, there will be huge cancellation fee.
* No eating outside or buying lunch. Bringing lunch made from home. That saves $240 per month.
* Be in the lookout for suitable person to rent other room. Ideally someone who is in IT field
* I have paid $6k in excess to my personal loan. I'm keeping it there because
* I'm working with a cabler/electrician during the weekend. He pays me $200 per day. If I quit my IT job

I recently moved to the US for a job. The last few weeks I've just used funds from my non-US bank

I've read two books about managing personal finance in the US and have researched a good amount online and think I have a relatively good understanding of the system. However

This is what I'm currently planning to do:

1) Open savings account (200%-300% of monthly expenses in it - ""safety cushion"") and checking account (I'll have my paycheck deposited in here; at the end of each month the remaining money will go to my investment account) at a bank. Currently I'm favoring Bank of America simply because one of their branches is down the street and they have many locations/ATMs; any other recommendations? Online Banking is important to me.

2) Get a credit card. I don't care about rewards etc. I always pay 100% of my credit back in time. Now one question that I had was if it is possible to have the money I've spent on my credit card automatically withdrawn from my checkings account. The credit score is something I'm not worried about at the moment

3) Open a Roth IRA (I'll max out the allowed investment here) and an investment account (Mutual Bonds/Stock Funds) with Vanguard Group. I'll pursue a fairly aggressive investment strategy

Ok and here are two more general questions:
- The reason Mutual Fund Companies are recommended is the lower expense ratio
- I am considering using Mint.com (or any other application/service capable of automatically retrieving account information) for convenience. I'm concerned about this being a security risk. Does anyone know what steps the banks and software developers have taken to make sure nobody can get my information?

Total net monthly income: $2425.00
We have 2 checking accounts

Monthly expenses:

My car - ~$300

Wife's car - ~$225

Mortgage - ~$350

Utilities (water

Gas expense (from long commute to work) - ~$340

Oil changes, alignments, etc. etc.) ~ $100

Estimated Monthly Medical expenses (incl. doctor's visits and prescription meds- ~ $120

Pet supplies/pet care - ~$50

Food/groceries/household items - ~$275

Credit card debt - ~$100


My wife also has student loans, and aren't making any payments on them.  Things like house, car, and utilities had to take a priority.


The remaining balance get trickled away on food, etc.  There's never actually any ""extra"" money at the end of the month.


My wife &amp; I have both quit smoking in an effort to save money


I know that one of my biggest problems is my commute.  I am the part owner of a restaurant that my father and I opened up together, but I really do not wish to work in another restaurant, and I have no other marketable skills other than a 12 year history of managing and owning restaurants.


One of my biggest problems is my car.  It is currently parked, even if it *didn't* need so much work.  Should I just stop making payments on it and let it get repo'ed?  It has been repossessed once before, a few years ago, but I managed to get it back.  Wish now I had just let it go.


I haven't checked my credit score in a couple of years, and my previous repo of the car, and because of the way I'm constantly running late on pretty much everything.


What should I do?  Specifically about my junk PoS car


This is a bit of a wildcard, so that I can get out of this rut of being stuck in the restaurant industry.  However, as dumb as this sounds, the military actually looks at your credit history when considering if you are eligible to join or not.  My credit is BAD as it is, I'm afraid of ruining it further with something like a repo or a bankruptcy.  I'm not 100% dead set on going military, but I'd like for it to remain an option.

I am 23 years old and always very conscience about retirement. I am always very concerned on making the right moves to be financially stable when I am older. I would definitely like to retire before the age of 60.

My Background:

Making about $70k a year.

Contributing 5k a year into a ROTH. Actively managing my investments. Currently all are in dividend stocks set up with DRIP's. 

Company match 401k is 6%. Dollar for dollar for the first 3% and 50 cents on the dollar for the next 3%. I am contributing 6% to take advantage of the full match.

I put about $200 a month into my trading account and do some swing/day trading when I have time.

I am saving about $500 a month into my savings account for emergencies.

I have some school loan debt and that's it.

I have been thinking about purchasing an investment property but I would need to find the right partner in my area.

Basically my question is

Thanks for all your help!

**EDIT:**

I want to thank you all for a lot of great responses! Here's what I've gathered so far:

- Max out ROTH IRA at 5k a year
- Max out 401k
- Save 12-15k for emergency fund and place it in a savings account to hopefully earn some interest
- Take care of your teeth! Dental care is expensive
- Invest and take advantage of compound interest
- When you have kids

They have $60K in other debts from the business and personal combined, the value of the property is maybe $90K on a good day.

Then the banker says, ""wait. we see you have at least $7K in tax liens here. We need another $2K for fees and interest. Pay us $12K and we'll give you a new 2nd mortgage.""

They close this Thursday. I read through the lien and collateral notice, and it is a waaaay more complicated document then the original one they signed - it includes wording such as ""if a new lien is placed on the property you have 15 days to discharge it, or the lender can claim loss on their security"" or ""lender must be notified of any insurance payments (regarding damage from wind/fire/etc) within 15 days of causality, and has the right to intercede all payments and apply to indebtedness or to fix claim"". The deed also says the lender has the right of ""sale"" - which makes me think they can sell the property whether mom and dad are in default or not on the 2nd mortgage. The issue about paying off any new liens within 15 days also has me worried, vs indebtedness).
