The whole experience was fantastic and went way beyond my expectations. As my flair indicates

During the trip, which was set to 'Europe' instead of 'Worldwide'. I thought I had solved the problem by buying new shoes at the Three Eagles Outfitter, but in fact, those shoes only made it worse. Thinking it was just the 'brake in phase', I walked the next days all the way to Franklin only to return them in their other Three Eagles Outfitter store. Once they saw my ruined feet, they made sure to replace them with some awesome Merrell Barefeet shoes (vibram soles) which made my blisters go away in the next few days.

I've met over 50 people on the trail, with people giving me food and drinks on numerous accounts of trail magic (9 bags of Mountain House dinners in one case in Fontana) and the rides people were offering me to the nearby towns. I learned what I was capable of, and walked a total of 332 miles which is a nice average of about 10 miles a day (including the forced zero days). It was also nice to spend some time in Atlanta as well, I got there by Greyhound. (Erwin &gt; Johnson City &gt; Knoxville &gt; Atlanta).

* **AN ABRIDGED HISTORY**

The Appalachian Trail is a 2, who became the first man to hike the entire thing, though not in one season. That was first done in 1948 by a WW2 vet and total badass named Earl Shaffer. He was a baller.  Nobody believed him when he claimed that he had done the entire thing at once, because that's fucking crazy. But he did, and he set the tradition of going northbound from Georgia to Maine, the reverse of the Trail's official route. Since then some other notable folks have hiked it and some other stuff has happened and you can read about all of it on Wikipedia.


* **GEOGRAPHY**

The AT passes through, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, New Hampshire, I hiked nearly all of Maryland in one day because Maryland is really goddamned easy

The southern terminus of the Trail is on little Springer Mountain, or dirty sou-bounders.

The trail is pretty rough from Georgia all the way through Tennessee, New Hampshire, but still not the easiest part by far). And if you start in March, like it did, it's still really goddamned cold in the southern mountains. I had a 15 degree bag and I was still really cold some nights in the Smokies. It started warming up in Tennessee, but I didn't send my cold weather gear home until southern Virginia.

Everything becomes instantly better in Virginia, VA, home to the annual hikerpalooza festival, Trail Days. Southern and central Virginia is full of great towns and great trail, and the climbs start being concentrated into big two- or three-thousand footers followed by miles of flat ridge-walking. Once you hit the Shenandoahs, it all gets really, really flat pretty much until the end of Massachusetts.

The only thing really notable, because it is really flat. The reason it gets so much hate are the rocks. So many rocks. And poison ivy. There are miles of Pennsylvania that are just a big game of The Floor Is Lava where you have to hop across rocks or else walk through poison ivy. That's half of Pennsylvania, and the other half is farm valleys, which are really nice and flat and really pretty although sometimes they smell like shit.

Once you hit Vermont, but full of super nice people and it's really easy to get a hitch. After you leave Vermont and head into New Hampshire, you hit the Whites. A lot of people say this is the hardest part of the trail, but I disagree. The Whites are tough, definitely, and are run by the Appalachian Mountain Club, a private organization that doesn't give one single fuck about thru-hikers, big mountains (including Mt. Washington

Then you get into Maine, it's smooth sailing all the way to Katahdin, the only mountain on the trail that's not part of a range, and the biggest sustained climb of the entire journey.


* **PREPARATION**

""Oh shit

But that's bullshit. I'd never hiked further than 60 miles in one trip before starting this trail. It helps to physically prepare yourself by running and working out your core, but the only thing that can prepare you for long-distance hiking is long-distance hiking. Despite what some more elitist hikers say, you can hike yourself into shape. The AT is, by far, less of a physical challenge than a mental one.

That said, but if you can come to terms with that and just keep going, then that's one major mental challenge overcome.

I didn't do too much planning, shelter to shelter. I think that's pretty silly, but I knew some people who actually did stick to it completely. If that's the sort of thing you're into, go for it. But flexibility, I think, is a major virtue on the trail. I only had short-term schedules, drawn from data in my guidebook, but I recommend AWOL's AT Guide.

As for your budget,500, but you'll be living a very Spartan life. You will really want beers when you hit towns, I promise.

The most important part of preparation is knowing a whole lot about... CONTINUE TO PART II.",,t5_2stbz,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/AppalachianTrail/comments/l235y/the_appalachian_trail_a_howto_guide/

A couple months back

I had to let the project sit for a while (b/c I was on the road, I've had a chance to add a bunch of stuff that I hope will make the site more useful:

* I've added a ton of new data, POs, towns and most of the hostels.  Now, it's got almost all of the important stuff.  I'm sure there are a bunch of things I missed.  If so, these can easily be added.  It's got everything I think you would need to hike the trail.  I'd test it myself, but that'll have to wait until next time!
* I've added trail maps to the PDF guides.  I wanted to get this in when I first posted the site
* I've added some stats to the site.  Using the elevation profile data, now, at a glace you can get a rough idea of the difficulty of each section of the trail (and, yes, I know, there's more to trail difficulty than just the grade).
* I've also built a pretty basic 'planner' to help estimate how long your hike will take and when you'll be at various places along the trail.  I got the idea from http://www.pctplanner.com/

I think this can be a really useful tool for people preparing for the trail as well as people already in the middle of a hike.  Pretty much anything on the trail can be reviewed by users - water sources, towns, sections of the trail.  Water source dry?  Say so, and future hikers will know not to rely on that water source.  Great experience at a trail hostel?  Leave a review, and let your fellow hikers know.

I've put A LOT of time into this project - WAY more than I was planning on.  Once I got started, but I'd hate it if all of this work were to go to waste.  Please, take a look at what I've built. Tell me what you think (as long as it's constructive, thank you).  If you like it, tell your AT friends.  And, if you're leaving for the trail soon, consider taking the PDF guides on your phone/kindle - can't hurt to have a backup guide!

Thanks for looking!

I'm interested in seeing how my list stacks up to other thru-hikers

Put yours in order from 1 (favorite) to 13 (least favorite) with some highlights of each state. For the sake of argument


Wobegon's List:

1. **Maine.** 
    A fantastic and eerie finale to my thru-hike. Southern Maine (especially the section between Stratton and Rangeley) I believe is the toughest section of the whole Trail, blueberries, moose, awesome swimming, pancakes at Pierce Pond, the White Wolf Burger in Stratton (don't attempt the challenge)

2. **New Hampshire.**
For the northbounder, Mt. Moosilauke, Hanover

3. **Virginia**
    Try to avoid the ""blues"" and Virginia is a lovely state. On my NOBO hike, I flourished as a hiker. So much to see, considering nearly 1/4th of the trail is in this state. Highlights: gorging myself in Shenandoah Nat'l Park, ponies at the Grayson Highlands, The Priest, Ming's Buffet in Waynesboro

4. **Vermont**
    After I got out of the very muddy section just across the border, the Long Trail Inn.

5.  **Georgia**
Great southern hospitality

6. **North Carolina/Tennessee**
    I was still learning at this point, Charlies Bunion and the rest of the Smokies, Watuaga Dam, Standing Indian Mountain.

7. **Massachusetts**
    Northbounders are eager to finally have reached NEW ENGLAND! It was quite muddy when I was there

8. **West Virginia**
    Sure

9.  **New York**
    The deli-to-deli hike was in full swing by the time we were all in the Empire State. AMAZING. Highlights: Bear Mountain

10.  **Maryland**
    Awesome Civil War history and easy trail. Another highlight is fantastic shelters.

11.  **New Jersey**
    Brink Road Shelter I believe has the absolute worst mosquitoes of anywhere in the country I have ever been, church hostel in Vernon, Sunfish Pond.

12. **Pennsylvania**
    Oh, go down the ridge to a road, repeat. I believe the local section hikers there are masochists. Some highlights though: The Doyle, half-gallon challenge, lovely shelters (when there is water, which in summer can be rare).

13. **Connecticut**
    Where hiker trash meets yuppie richies! The two major trail towns

I settled on thru-hiking the AT early this year. I'm just about down to 5 months to go 'til my departure date. Getting pumped

* Big Agnes Roxy Ann 15 degree womens petite bag and Big Agnes Insulated Air Core (the pad slides into the bag

I've also bought my cookware:

* MSR Pocket Rocket Stove (3oz), and will use an 8oz IsoPro fuel canister.

I've also bought some of my clothes, shoes and bag. 

SHELTER - For a while I was considering a bivy tarp combo for shelter but the more I think about being in the tight quarters of a bivy for 6 months (especially in the summer!) the more I am leaning to getting an UL tent. Right now the Shangra-La 1 with bug nest is on the top of my list. It gives me so many options for such little weight (just over 2 lbs for the tarp, just the tarp, or just the bug nest for when it's hot as balls. I guess I'm pretty sold, but I am looking for real peoples experiences with the tent and other possible options before I splurge. 

SHOES - I have heavy duty hiking boots

BAG - This is going to be the last thing I buy to assure that I don't get one too big or too small. I want something light, any recommendations, advice, etc.?

Sorry this post has gotten quite long! Any input would be Much Appreciated! Happy Trails!

If this site is going to be as useful as either of the guides already in use, it's going to need a lot more content (esp. water sources and town info).  I'm going to keep adding more information to the trail, but if this site is going to sustain itself, then it's going to need input from other people too.  Also, my data comes from 2011 with a few edits based on my experience this summer - so, if you see anything out of date in what I've added

If things go well, expensive or non-existent.

So what do you think

I hike often, so I told thought I'd ask you guys:

* Do many people start alone? approximately what is the percentage?
* I've understood that people tend to form groups
* Other than common sense things
* What are the odds of a person hiking alone
* Is it worth it to get one of those emergency locator beacons?

Also

* Is it feasible to take a sleeping bag rated around ~35F and a liner

We parked my car at the Lehigh Gap Nature Center, so there was no initial uphill hike to get onto the trail.  The first several miles were all flat and wide, perfect for inexperienced hikers to get their footing.  There was some rock scrambling at the knife's edge and bake oven knob, but it was still fairly easy.  We stayed at the bake oven knob shelter overnight, which was about 6 miles from our start.  Next day we hiked out to the nature center at the water gap.  This day was a little over 7 miles, had less rocks and was mostly downhill all day.

5. When you stay at one of the shelters located along the trail

6. When you have to leave the trail for a zero day, especially in NY, CT and MA, don't really know much about the AT. Do some of the people ever give you trouble?

7. How do you wash your clothes as you go? Do you even wash them?

8. How do you bathe as you go? Do you even bathe?

9. How can you clean your cookware?

10. How do you dry your clothes after they get wet? It seems like people generally recommend you don't make fires while hiking the AT

I'm TRYING to it all out, it might not be crowded enough.  I DO want to meet people.  If I wanted to be all alone, I would go to Alaska.  There is also the weather.  An early start promises to get you through the mid-Atlantic before the summer gets too hot and humid. But that can result in very nasty conditions (snow, cold rain) in the southern Appalachians.  And you'll probably miss the fall foliage in New England.  A later start (like April 15th) pretty much guarantees hot and muggy conditions in Penna. and, possibly, a race to make it to Katahdin before the snow starts falling in October.  I would also imagine that if I didn't start until mid-April, I would utterly hate going to work each and every day.  I would be SO itchy to get on the trail.

So I really don't know.  My feeling is that I'll probably want to start sometime between March 15th and April 1sth, March 1sth, March 15th, March 21st and April 1st are popular starting dates although it seems that people are starting earlier and earlier.

Big three: REI Flash 62 pack (3lb2oz)

Total pack weight

Things I'd leave out next time: GPS (didn't use it), and sunglasses (didn't use; they might be necessary on more open sections of trail), half of my first-aid kit, trowel (just use a stick or your boot to dig the hole).

Things I'd change:

* Empty Gatorade bottles in place of Nalgenes (1oz vs. 5.6oz); this was the biggest suggestion I got from the thru-hikers we sheltered with.
* Cheap rain poncho in place of nice 1-pound packable raincoat.
* A lighter multi-tool; my Leatherman Wave is just over half a pound.
* Lighter boots. Mine are great for any terrain and any weather

That would knock a few pounds off. After that I don't think there's  much to lose without switching out the big three for more ultralight-style gear.

Things I'd add:

* A deck of cards or some kind of game. One thru-hiker I met had a scrabble board drawn on his sleeping pad; presumably he was carrying scrabble tiles. I thought that was cool. If you also drew a checkboard you could use scrabble tiles as checkers too (face-up vs. face-down)

However, and find a new home for my pet cat.

All of this stuff is doable, but nothing life-changing like this could be.

But I'm still not yet able to shake the voice in my head that's reminding me that it could be terrible. I have visions of myself going, getting sick of hiking after a week, etc., and dropping out of the trail after having moved heaven and earth to get there. It would be horribly, horribly depressing.

I'm especially worried (while being simultaneously excited) about the social aspect of it. I'd be going alone, and then just sort of be scared to talk to anyone, and turn into a miserable loner. I feel like I never hear about this sort of thing, but I still can't shake the image. 

Thru-hikers (prospective and past): How did you guys get over these sorts of anxieties about ""what if it all turns out terrible?"" I feel like I'm one good pep talk away from telling everyone I'm doing it, but I just am having trouble working up the nerve.

**Shaws/Lake House
Can't go wrong with either of these places

**Green Mountain House
Jeff is a great owner, great functional kitchen (for when all you want is cooking a huge meal of your own) and most importantly, a free pint of Ben and Jerry's with your stay!

**Kincora Hostel
When Bob Peoples goes hiking

**Palmerton ""Jail"" Hostel
The kind people of Palmerton open up the basement of their city borough hall for thru-hikers. No donation necessary and one of the best showers (although that may just be because I was especially stanky) on the whole Trail.

**The AT Lodge
Either the end or the beginning for many thru-hikers. I spent two great nights there

**Tom Levardi's
Not a hostel

**Pine Ellis
Over-priced, but not cool. Prepare to be nickel and dimed until you set foot back on the Trail.

**Standing Bear Hostel
""Workers"" that push drugs and are generally Deliverance type hillbillies. And not the cool kind.

Our backgrounds:
I've never done a multi-day hiking trip, and what I've been on seemed pretty easy. My friend is from Colorado, and she's done week-long hikes in the Rockies, but she's never seen the AT. We're setting a pace of 10 miles a day, because her experience in the Rockies leads her to believe that's all she can do.  

My plan:
I'd like to take a shuttle from Clingman's Dome in the Smokies to some point about 40-50 miles away

Gear - I've got:  
-North Face Terra 65 pack  
-Steripen water purification system  
-A 1-liter canteen  
-50 feet of para cord  
-a lightweight windbreaker and a good poncho  
-first aid kit  
-toiletries
-a decent amount of food  
-clothes
-my friend has a camping stove and pot

I still need:  
-Bear bag for food  
-Sleeping bag  
-Tent (or do I?) (I'm leaning toward the REI Passage 1)  
-I'd like to pick up a ka-bar knife   

Am I missing anything? I know there are shelters every 5-10 miles on this part of the trail

I checked the weather forecast for Gatlinburg

With regards to water -- how much should I carry with me? How frequent are sources of water on the trail?  

Any recommendations for a particular shuttle service? There are a lot to choose from in the Smokies.

So I'm 24 years old I recently graduated from college and started a new corporate job. I've been working retail for the past 6 years and have never taken more than 4 days off. In the past few years I've put on weight

When I was fresh out of high school I was an avid outdoorsman i hunted fished took day hikes and camped. I always wanted to do a section hike but never did. 

Past few weeks of my life have been annoying. First world personal problems etc... So I decided I'm finally going on this hike. I know there's a way for a guy that's out of shape but determined to do it with the right equipment and planning. 

I'm not too humble to hike on the kiddie trails because I'm out of shape I just want to spend 5-6 days alone in the wilderness traveling. 

Things i would love to do along the way:

Hunt (I have valid nj firearms license and hunting permits) Im not against buying a gun specifically for the trip if need be

Fish

Kayak

Meet other hikers/campers

Cliff diving 

What section do you recommend and what should I take into account while planning this trip?

Now, so hopefully I won’t be asking a bunch of usual questions. 

* First of all – my most pressing concern – six months is a long time. Not that I wouldn’t mind winding down after college, as I started my undergrad in Arizona and she her master’s in Connecticut. But during that we could Skype pretty much every night and of course text and call all day. Which is where my question comes in: how do hikers communicate with loved ones on the trail? If I brought a phone, would reception be a hassle? Is it frowned upon to bring a phone? If she wanted to come visit me at some point (all the way from Arizona), what’s the best way to coordinate that? 

* Secondly, but I’ll probably be upgrading to a newer Rebel within a year or so. Do I want to avoid a DSLR to cut down on weight? Did anyone bring a tripod? 

* I think it’s safe to say I’m a pretty novice hiker. I spent four years in the Marine Corps, I’d like to make the most of that time getting prepared. I figured I’m just going to try and hike a lot, or should I figure out a regimen of sorts? Also, does anyone know of some reliable resources to find a good overnight trail in Arizona? 

* Also, so I’m completely oblivious here.

With only 90 days or less left before many of you head out for the adventure of a lifetime

If you can, 40 steps? A few more floors?  Make that the next go around's goal. Repeat. After a few weeks, really start to push goals. Mountains are kinda big. Ups, sometimes, go on for miles.

No gym? That's cool, or any place where there may be a significant amount of steps to cut down on rests in between sets. In a pinch, a steep hill or path will work. Just like your mechanized brothern (or sistern) pick a number and do it. Push yourself. Complete, evaluate (be honest with yourself) and adjust for the next time.

This workout is going to help get your body prepared for the hills. Almost every hiker dreads ups. By having a little bit of conditioning done ahead of time


Bonus workout: If you are the employed sort,"" that's cool. Find a large building and access the stairs next to the elevator. You don't have to work there (public building are best for this) to access them, silly fire codes. :)   Even better, those spaces are usually quasi-heated for your winter time workouts. 

Oh yeah, no poles, none of it. You don't need that right now. This is for priming those climbing muscles.

so first post here so take it easy on me.  I'm looking to make a Thru hike of the AT this year but i have some hurdles that i'm trying to overcome and i was hoping this community might be able to help.  First, and i'm still living with my parents and so convincing them to let me go would be the first step.  Next is that i don't have many friends who want to do nearly as much as i do if at all and even the ones who i might be able to sell on it have little to no experience backpacking.  Which leads me into my last problem, i am no stranger to the outdoors, hiking, camping, starting fires, leave no trace rules and the like. However

So to sum things up:

* I am fairly young and need to sell my parents on the idea of me walking through the woods for 5 months.

Here's a [link to my blog](http://proverbamodei.blogspot.com/) with chapters from the story. Chapter 13 and onwards is where Monson / Sebec Lake are the featured setting

My question for you folks is this - what is the trail like in this area? How is the weather? What is the general mood of the folks who live in the trail villages in Maine and New Hampshire? Do they treat hikers kindly (I've heard that they do). What is the flora and fauna like? How easy is it to get 'away from it all' and be surrounded by miles of woodland? Also - what's the nearest hospital to Monson that receives severe accidents? Is there one closer than Bangor?

It's 73.7 miles from FNSP - Hogan rd. I figure on 10 mile days so that gives me almost 7 days to hit hogan rd. Once I hit Hogan rd on the 22nd I plan to hitch a ride or walk to Gorham and take the shuttle back down to 93 if I can even do that...

I grew up on a farm and lived in the woods when I was a kid. Long story short I can handle myself outdoors. She has plenty of car camping experience but not much more. We have the gear we are going to use and she has been training for longer hikes with more weight than we will use. She is in very good shape. Little experience staying out but she is stoked to get into it. We are getting married in August and will be spending 6 days in the Gatlinburg area. Only 2 of those are planned in a hotel. We also want to hit a few day hikes and outings between now and then. I have always dreamed of hiking the Appalachian and we both want to do a 3 day thru hike when we are close in August. One simple question is the car? Where would we park to link up and for shorter trips like this do people go so far out and turn around or do you arrange a ride back to your vehicle?

I am at a complete standstill in choosing between the [Tarptent Notch](http://www.tarptent.com/notch.html) and [Big Agnes Copper Spur](https://www.bigagnes.com/Products/Detail/Tent/copperspurul12012). I like these because they're relatively roomy (for 1 person) and double-walled. 


BA Pros/Cons:

* Larger width (1.07m)

* Will probably get more use out of it after the AT because I generally do not use trekking poles

* Has great reviews

* More expensive (~$350)

* Heavier (44oz)

TT Pros/Cons:

* Lighter (26 oz) because of the trekking pole setup (from everyone's advice I know poles are a necessity)

* Cheaper (though not by much once I consider seam sealing and shipping)

* Also has good reviews, so I guess this comes with the territory.

Sleepwalker wore hiking boots and a long sleeve Under Armor shirt, curly, stood up with assistance form sweat and lack of showering. When he spoke his lower jaw projected and his bottom teeth were exposed rather than his upper teeth. He smiled, often. 
Johnny walker wore a silver plated chain necklace, yet his enthusiasm for the trail surpassed all the others. 
Shake wore a hand crocheted hat, he wore a long sleeve and pants. 
Keystone
Sleepwalker had a habit of walking late into the night
Johnny Walker started in Pennsylvania unlike the other three. On the waning night before starting the trail he drank heavily and received a name that friends gave to him. One must assume that there was a fair amount of whiskey involved in that night. 
Stash did not reveal the origin of his trail name. Other through hikers knew him for his hiking style, visit, or acquire stashes of pot, or so I hypothesized.
Most admitted that the trail was very hard and that even with only 600 miles left that they were never planning on hiking the trail again. Perhaps they will feel differently upon completion.
My night had begun as a random night with friends at the River Mill, from Newport had already offered a place to stay. He was happily drunk, a country fella who was confident in his driving abilities. PBR 24oz cans were accepted all around with smiles painted under their scraggly beards. An AT hiker will never turn down a beer. 
Stash remarked, not the pace at which he wished to finish the trail.
Sleepwalker drank less than the others and was far more focused than the other three. They had all spent a week of zero days at Murtal beach with Stash’s friends. They drank, he had enjoyed the change of pace and relaxation but was determined to finish the trail the same as he had started it, a sleepwalker.

1357879486.0,16d1h3,I would love your help filling in a few gaps in my pack list.,dahvzombie,3,0,5,"As you might have guessed if you've seen how often I comment in this sub, it'd be pointless to do otherwise I think.

At any rate, not hugely tight, but I am taking a few extra pounds over spending a lot on gear. 

HEADLAMPS (Both): I like the look of the black [diamond gizmo](http://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en-us/shop/mountain/lighting/gizmo-headlamp/)

POLES (Me): I'm 5'10

SLEEPING PAD (Me): The thermarest z-lite is wonderfully light and simple, can I get away with an uninsulated air mattress like [this](http://www.exped.com/exped/web/exped_homepage_na.nsf), or will I freeze in the smokies if I don't get an insulated one?

SLEEPING BAG (Her): She still needs a bag. She's 5'5"" and a fairly cold sleeper. Can she get away with a [Kelty Cosmic Down 20](http://www.amazon.com/Kelty-Cosmic-20-Degree-Sleeping-Regular/dp/B005F5EPAG/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357877832&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=cosmic+down)? Or does she need something warmer? We'll be sharing a 2-person tent and I'll probably throw my down jacket  over her bag to help a little. At the moment I'm thinking to get it

FOOD BAG (Both): I think the large [Outdoor products bag from this set](http://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Products-3-Pack-Ultimate-Sack/dp/B001AZNATC) will serve as a food bag. It's maybe 9 liters. Any recommendations for or against? There are reviews but none I could find specifically by long distance hikers. 

GROUNDCLOTH (Both): We've got a [Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2](https://www.bigagnes.com/Products/Detail/Tent/FlyCreekUL2). We've used it with an existing ground mat I've had

RAIN GEAR (Both): We have some crappy ponchos but I have serious doubts about their efficacy when it's 33 degrees and raining. I think they're fine for more moderate weather, but they only need to last maybe two months down south then another month towards the end- we'll use the lighter ponchos or even nothing in the middle.

PACK COVER (Me): I've got a rather unusual pack with a 40 year old, but I'm keeping it because of budgeting, the fact that I've hiked a few hundred miles in in with no issues, and the ventilation. Any reason not to just use a heavy duty trash bag? 

Thanks for any help!

EDIT:2  So guys, and my grandfather was smiling the biggest i've seen in a long time. They took me up into the attic, and pulled out this old chest FULL of backpacking stuff, photo albums, and all kinds of stuff that they used when they hiked the trail in the 60's. He gave it all to me. They said they would do everything in their power to support help me with this journey.. I'm literally in tears of joy right now.
