* Please do not use sarcasm or rhetorical questions. Rhetorical questions can only have negative consequences

In reading [this article, but I propose to be distinct: **protecting America versus protecting *Americans*.**

The programs the director is defending are presumably counter-terrorism efforts. But in order to accept that thwarting terrorism is equivalent to protecting America, defeat our military and compromise our government institutions all at once. [The evidence doesn't support that terrorism rises to this level.](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/04/statistics-you-are-not-going-to-be-killed-by-terrorists.html)

The Soviet Union, having invaded dozens of lands in a steady, five-year march across the Pacific, culminating in a full-scale aerial assault on a US naval base, represented an existential threat to the nation. Nazi Germany, having conquered half of Europe in just two years, and with its submarines attacking US shipping within sight of the East coast

Instead, does not in itself represent a threat to the nation.

In fact, and justice under the law — would be to eliminate all these domestic surveillance programs, targeted killings, indefinite detention and the other associated anti-terrorism measures, because they themselves are a bigger threat to the American way of life than anything a terrorist can muster. But if we accept that terrorism does represent *some* level of threat (albeit not existential), supporting a reduction in counter-terrorism efforts means we would accept higher risk to our personal safety in exchange.

So, or do you believe that it's the responsibility of the military to protect American lives, potentially at the cost of the American *way* of life?

-----

I'd like to make two observational side notes here: 

1. Reddit's readership skews decidedly young. If you were born after roughly 1988, no Patriot Act, no warrantless wiretaps, no Department of Homeland Security, no prison at Guantanamo Bay, no drones, no ""Homeland"" or ""24, terrorism was generally seen as something that happened far away. For you folks, and I'm sure not everyone falls into this category
2. The traditional job of the US military has been to protect the nation from *existential threats, as a threat.

We would first like to begin with a quote from /u/BatCountry9 that sums up the heart of this issue perfectly:

I'm always interested to hear the pros and cons of initiatives like this. According to the [NTSB website](http://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/2013/eliminate_impaired_driving/faq.html)

* Fatal crashes decreased 18 percent in Queensland and 8 percent in New South Wales after those Australian states lowered their per se BAC limits from 0.08 to 0.05. 

* A study of per se BAC reductions in several European countries found that the change from a 0.08 to a 0.05 per se BAC limit reduced traffic deaths by 8-12 percent among people aged 18-49. 

* Regarding crash risk, drivers are 38 percent more likely to be in a crash than are sober drivers. 

* Although lowering the per se BAC threshold may seem counterintuitive when the majority of alcohol-impaired drivers in fatal crashes have BAC levels well over 0.08

**Submission guidelines**

/r/NeutralPolitics only allows self (text) posts

These components make a good post:

1. Asks a specific question
2. Outlines the issue well
3. Links to a qualified source or sources
4. Proposes a starting point for discussion
5. Identifies potential flaws in the arguments presented
6. Contains an accurate title

If you don't have a specific source, as was done [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/11m6mp/regarding_economic_policies_how_can_a_layman/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/15sfd7/what_are_some_ways_that_the_united_states_could/).

If your source is an opinion article

Speculative posts or requests for prognostication are held to an especially high standard. Since there's no way to provide supporting evidence for answers to ""What would happen if..."" types of questions

These kinds of posts will get removed:

* *Inflammatory.* ""Labour Party is idiotic!""
* *Editorializing.* ""Senator Josephs proposes the worst immigration plan in history.""
* *Overly broad.* Extremely broad posts don't usually generate useful discussion. However, so they won't automatically be removed. For example, a post without references that simply requests, ""Please explain the Federal Reserve,"" doesn't sufficiently outline the issue. However, a post that properly frames the broad question, ""What are the advantages and disadvantages of a country having a central bank, depending on which sources it referred to.
* *""Taking the temperature"" style questions*
* *""Survey"" style questions* that inherently cannot have a definitive answer
* *Misleading title.*
* *Based on bad sources.* Posts referencing poor
* *Bad starting point for discussion.* Any post that's unlikely to generate useful, the post and all comments will be removed.


Source quality:

* The preferred sources are academic articles from neutral organizations.
* Wikipedia should not be cited by an OP as the primary or solitary source. You can cite Wikipedia
* If your source is a news article
* Opinion pieces are tricky. Generally speaking, unbiased exploration of an issue gets published as an opinion piece and does provide a good starting point. If your opinion piece itself doesn't provide sources, forget about posting it. 
* If your source is a book
* No hearsay. The article must either contain a direct quote or a link to a direct quote that substantiates the position being attributed to the speaker. So

We do not maintain a ""blacklist"" of sources

**Our ""culture""**

The original [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/pteu5/meta_rneutralpolitics_frequently_asked_questions/) calls /r/NeutralPolitics ""a constructive environment for political discourse[...] where those of differing opinions can come together and rationally lay out respective arguments. We are neutral in that no political opinion is favored here - only facts and logic."" We still hold to this ideal.

These folks get it:

/u/biskino: ""We're not deciding issues here - we're talking about them (and talking about how others are talking about them).""

/u/young_d: ""What I want from this sub

/u/Monkeyfusion: ""...its a forum where we can really talk about issues and hash out what the best solution might be

/u/HeartyBeast provides this quote from Russell's *History of Western Philosophy*:

&gt;""When an intelligent man expresses a view which seems to us obviously absurd
&gt;
&gt;This exercise of historical and psychological imagination at once enlarges the scope of our thinking

The consensus of the community is that [neutral is not the same as moderate](http://redd.it/15d8fc)

1360533182.0,189nl6,Internet personalization could be contributing to a more hostile political atmosphere,BruceWayneIsBarman,141,29,35,"I wrote this as a comment on another thread

I recently read [The Filter Bubble](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/books/review/book-review-the-filter-bubble-by-eli-pariser.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) and I've been dwelling on the impact that this structure could have on our access to facts (read: ""truth"") as well as their context and how we interpret them.

Quick background on what the ""filter bubble"" is: in 2009, ABC News, and Amazon) began customizing our search results, news feeds, and generally ""tailoring"" the sites and affiliates to the users preferences (this is why you see certain G-mail notes auto-marked as important, for example, and why certain people always show up on your Facebook news feed).

This is all well and good - it saves us from looking for what we are most interested in. However, etc. and thusly creates a ""bubble"" effect in which basically creates an automated confirmation bias - the things you agree with are reinforced, and the things that are deemed unimportant simply don't show up.

Author [Eli Parsier, indoctrinating us with our own ideas, amplifying our desire for things that are familiar."" His concern is that we have massive companies (Google, Facebook) that we use as news and political sources that are compounding incorrect or incorrectly interpreted data. Additionally, we may be missing information all together. The personalization goes so far as to which sentence structures you prefer (again, note the G-mail example for which are marked important if from a new sender) - which is structures similar to your own (you are more likely to listen to a source like yourself). This tightens the filter bubble effect even more.

So, most people don't know that their feeds are as closed off as they are.


**EDIT:** When I wrote this, or doesn't *without their knowledge of the change*. 


**Suggestions for minimalizing or eliminating the filter bubble effect on a personal scale:**

- Alternating browsers

- Incognito

- Using search engines that don't use your information (such as DuckDuckGo.com)

- Updating personal info for multiple locations (i/e: New York as well as San Fransisco) to soften regional news

- Using multiple news sources *(Fortunately most of us here in r/NeutralPolitics already prefer this!)*

People like us might be more inclined to say, but not everyone does that. I'm especially interested in discussing how this may or may not effect political discussions in the future, which are already so biased to begin with (and people are more susceptible to confirmation bias/less likely to seek outside sources).

1368308602.0,1e5ef8,Why don't we focus out efforts on nuclear fusion instead of other forms of green energy?,maxikov,151,35,116,"Nuclear fusion seems to be a silver bullet in energy development: it is perfectly safe for the nature, the amount of investments in this field is much smaller than that in wind or solar energy.

[Nuclear fusion](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/sep/16/nuclear-fusion-iter-jet-forshaw) is the process of colliding and joining nuclei together. If those nuclei are lighter than the atom of iron, ans slightly less powerful, but the amount of power it generates [is still tremendous](http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2012/01/nuclear-fusion/):

&gt;On a per mass, or 275 million kcal. Fission gives a comparatively small 20 million kcal per gram of ^235 U. So fusion is over ten times as potent. Keep in mind that chemical energy like that in fossil fuels is capped around 10 kcal/g. Note the conspicuous absence of the word million. On the energy scale, then, nuclear in either form is outrageously more potent than chemical energy.

We can compare those 10^12 J per one gram of fuel to other forms of green energy. [The best of the best of solar cells](http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v95/i22/p223503_s1?isAuthorized=no) generates about 2 kW/kg. That means that one kilogram of those cells needs to operate for (1 (kilogram) x 10^12 J / 2 (kW/kg)) / (3600 (seconds per hour) x 12 (sunny hours a day) x 365.25 (days per year) = 317 years under ideal conditions to produce the same amount of energy, produces 190752 mWh of energy annually. That means, that the whole wind farm needs to operate for (10^12 J / (190752 (mWh) x 1000000 x 3600)) x 365.25 = 5 days to produce the energy of one gram of deuterium. Geothermal [Hellisheiði Power Station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellisheiði_Power_Station) produces 303 MW of electricity: (10^12 J / (303 MW x 1000000)) / 3600 = 9 hours of operation to compete with one gram of deuterium. 

The process of fusion itself is relatively easy to perform, so in case of any catastrophic failure it would just shut down, and not explode under any conditions (self-sustaining reaction is theoretically possible, and occurs in the cores of stars. However, it's impossible to achieve in the near future. Moreover, in the worst case scenario, only [0.1 gram of deuterium is in the reaction chamber](http://www.efda.org/faq/new-what-is-the-temperature-generated-in-a-tokamak-reactor-how-can-the-inner-wall-material-resist-that-temperature/). That won't make any significant explosion, but in minuscule amounts: only [3 Kg for ITER](http://www.fusion.ucla.edu/ITER-TBM/ITER-TBM2/Tritium%20Supply%20Considerations.ppt)

Finally,2417551,00.asp)) and [mining more nuclear fuel on the Moon](http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/humanexplore/exploration/exlibrary/docs/isru/06energy.htm).

In other words, wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy and others. It will be available not eventually, but within 20 years. Still, the world have only two major nuclear fusion facilities: ITER in Europe, [whose cost is](http://www.iter.org/factsfigures) 13 billion euros = $17 billion, [whose budget is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ignition_Facility) $3 billion.

[DOMA ruling.](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_g2bh.pdf)

I've been listening to talk radio on the way to work trying to figure out what the decisions were

From what I can tell:

[DOMA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_Marriage_Act) was declared unconstitutional, the federal government must recognize legal same sex marriages from states when dealing with federal benefits.

As far as [Prop 8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_8) is concerned, and will have no bearing on other states.  BUT, gay marriage will be allowed to proceed in California.

So are my summaries correct? 

What will be the results from these decisions by SCOTUS?

Interested to hear all opinions...

Edit: Will also change the text of this post as it is corrected (if it is corrected.)

**Bonus Question worth 50 points:** If anyone happens to have facts that might answer these questions:  Did the black vote (brought out by Obama in the election) help Prop 8 get passed in California?  Is there any truth to the claim that a majority of Black Americans do not view the gay rights struggle as a ""civil rights struggle"" and are therefore turned off to it?

Everyone seems to be saying that things wouldn't have gone down like it did if Martin or Zimmerman were of a different race. I really don't see how that's true given the facts of the case. Can anyone respond to me and explain why they believe differently?](http://libertyandrespect.tumblr.com/post/55461163964/on-george-zimmerman-and-race-in-america)

&gt; The New York Times had an article today featuring many reactions from the African American community. The general consensus displayed in the article is that if Martin were white this wouldn’t have happened and that if Zimmerman were black he would have been arrested quicker and may have been convicted. What we’re seeing is a clear view that this trial was about race and that it is emblematic of race issues in America.

&gt; I’m a white male, but to imply, nay outright state, that I can’t objectively look at facts and empathize with others who don’t look like I do is offensive to me. An inherent racism and sexism is presumed to exist within me simply because of my color and gender. I think those who espouse this idea are more racist and sexist than I.

&gt; From this perspective, was looking into people’s homes, and was hiding his face with a hoodie. Considering that there had been multiple break-ins in their neighborhood and that Zimmerman was on duty as neighborhood watch to help prevent more, doesn’t Martin sound suspicious enough without needing to bring race into the mix? This isn’t to say Martin was guilty of anything, and it seems clear that he was not, but simply that if anyone else was in Zimmerman’s position they would have been suspicious as well. It’s said that if Zimmerman were black he would have been arrested on the spot, but isn’t it more likely that the reason he wasn’t arrested was because he was already on the phone with the police explaining the situation before the fight even broke out and because as far as the police knew he was correctly following the state’s self-defense laws? We should also look at Zimmerman’s character. Zimmerman was raised in a multi-ethnic family and has black relatives. No witnesses provided any reason to believe that Zimmerman had a past of any racism. We now know that the tape NBC played when this case was still fresh was edited and that Zimmerman did not say what Martin’s race was until asked.

&gt; Despite all this Zimmerman is presumed to be a racist by so many people discussing this case. They’ve taken their view of how society works and they’re so sure of it that they seem to know Zimmerman must behave in tune. To think any other way is considered by them to be naive. Besides how this has already ruined George Zimmerman’s life, where 3.73 times as many African Americans are arrested for possession of marijuana despite usage rates only being 2% higher among blacks. This sort of real racism is devalued when anything and everything is described as being racist. If you’re against affirmative action: racist. If you agree Zimmerman was not guilty: racist. The same thing happens with sexism and anti-semitism. You’re pro-life: sexist. You’re against the state of Israel: anti-semite. For those terms too there is real sexism and anti-semitism out there, but it’s devalued when it’s used to cast broad and unevidenced aspersions.

The West 'decided' it was the best system and decided that anyone who still uses a dictatorial system

It is possible that the best way of governing would be through a benevolent and omnipresent dictator, and no one person or centralised power base can have the oversight to see to a whole nations issues.

The supposed success of democracy has come from its correlation with successful states and their supposedly lower instance of human rights abuses within its borders. However many of these nations have also historically been very oppressive outside their borders with a huge amount of dominance and violence in less developed -  or powerful

It could be argued that many of these strong democratic nations are only really being tested now in a time of economic hardship in which it is much less acceptable to meddle in foreign nations' resources and affairs

The real danger in democracy is essentially the tyranny of the majority. This is something that will only become more and more of a risk as times get harder, often ethnic divisions between people. 

So what do you think? Does the democratic system need safeguards? If so what are they? Or

EDIT
I would like to make my case more specific.

I think I would be wary that possibly a system that ensures representation of different groups could be beneficial to some extent. What I am trying to get at is that I fear tyranny of the majority being a bigger danger somewhere where there are unstable conditions combined with deep divides such as ethnic tension.

If so, what constitutional remedies are available?",BCSWowbagger2,118,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1iwxyh/is_the_presidents_suspension_of_the_obamacare/, if you have a general knowledge of the Employer Mandate and that it was suspended a couple of weeks ago

**BACKGROUND**

On July 2

The first suspended provision,d.aWc) legalese for “we’re not ready with the regulations, and you’re not ready with the reporting technology, so let’s try again next year.”  

The second suspended provision,” requires all large employers (defined by the ACA as, basically, anyone with 50 or more employees) to either provide Obamacare-compliant “minimal health insurance” to all full-time and some part-time employees or suffer substantial penalties (which were clarified as a tax penalty by the Supreme Court last year).  The reason given for the Mandate’s suspension was simply that suspending the reporting requirements would render enforcement of the Employer Mandate somewhat impractical.  Some Republicans have [suggested](http://thehill.com/blogs/twitter-room/other-news/309199-sen-graham-obama-delaying-employer-mandate-because-of-2014-election-concerns-) that the real motivation is to protect the Democrats during the midterm elections.

However, and I wanna Keep It Neutral in here.  This post is concerned strictly with the legality of the Administration’s suspension actions.

**LEGAL IMPLICATIONS**

The suspension of the reporting requirements is probably kosher, and even though the [ACA itself]( http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr3590enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr3590enr.pdf) states (at Section 1514(d)) that the reporting requirements come into effect on January 1st, 2014, it is absolutely within the Secretary’s ambit to announce, “Yeah, sure, this technically comes into effect in 2014, 2015.  See you then.”  This legal evasion of a law’s official start date is almost routine procedure in Washington, but it’s not criminal so long as the Executive was making a good-faith effort to complete the rulemaking on time.  Heck

To be sure, it seems that he may *not* suspend the reporting requirement itself, so, on whatever due date is eventually picked, employers will have to submit reporting for the *entire* period from 1 January 2014 up until that date.  From the Treasury announcement (and subsequent IRS guidance), it’s not clear that that’s their understanding of the law.  But, for all that, there’s no *obvious* violation of the law in the decision to suspend the employer reporting requirements.

However, to be quite illegal.  The ACA contains a mandatory “effective date” requirement at Section 1513(d), which reads, “The amendments made by this section shall apply to months beginning after December 31, 2013.”  This is less ambiguous than Section 1514(d) (which uses “periods” instead of “months”).  More importantly, the Secretary of the Treasury is simply *not* empowered to waive these requirements or the resultant penalties.  The statute gives him a lot of power to do that with reporting requirements, but not with the taxes themselves.  Now, but the “assessable payment” itself is imposed directly by Congress on employers (§4980H(a))

In short, *apparently*, the Department of the Treasury is, independently of Congress and the Constitution, *cancelling* that tax penalty for Tax Year 2014.  Right-wingers like [Michael McConnell]( http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323823004578591503509555268.html) and [Michael Cannon](http://www.cato.org/blog/yes-delaying-obamacares-employer-mandate-illegal) are not alone in considering this action illegal; some on the Left, like Sen. [Tom Harkin]( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/us/politics/house-gop-pushes-delay-on-individual-mandate-in-health-law.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0), and [Jonathan Chait]( http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/07/obama-employer-mandate-delay-train-wreck-or-not.html), like legendary constitutional lawyer [Ronald Rotunda]( http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/on-the-health-care-mandate-obama-reaches-beyond-the-law/2013/07/18/d442aefc-efb4-11e2-a1f9-ea873b7e0424_story.html)

**OBAMA’S DEFENSE**

Two weeks after Obama Administration suspended the Employer Mandate, presented, for the first time, the Administration’s legal justification for this action in his [testimony]( http://waysandmeans.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hl8_071713_iwry_testimony_final_.pdf) to the House Ways and Means Committee.  He argued that this is a routine exercise of Treasury’s authority under [§7805(a)](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7805), which grants the Secretary of the Treasury broad authority to make rules and regulations in order to enforce the Internal Revenue Code (which includes these penalties).  But the obvious rebuttal is that this suspension action (and the rules associated with it) don’t *enforce* the Internal Revenue Code, but specifically and directly *prevent* enforcement.  

Mr. Iwry cited half a dozen instances during the Clinton and Bush Administrations where, and if it was okay then, why shouldn’t it be okay now?  This is perhaps not the strongest defense that can be imagined – “Bush did it first” does not exactly prove that “it” was actually legal – but it is something.  Nevertheless, I, at least, found Mr. Iwry’s examples deeply unpersuasive.  In some of his examples, the statutes in question granted the Secretary broad authority to suspend or even amend portions of the law Congress had passed in order to make it work.  The ACA, grants no such authority with respect to the Mandate.  In other examples, [2005-29](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-05-29.pdf), [2006-100](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-06-100.pdf)

Mr. Iwry also listed as authorities several actions from during the Obama Presidency.  Since the Obama White House is what’s under examination here, that’d be less of a defense and more of an admission of broad unlawfulness!

**DISCUSSION**

So

The implications are, on his own authority, suspend a duly passed, concededly constitutional law, indefinitely, despite the express orders of Congress as expressed by the statute in question, then we no longer live in a democratic republic, with the President being the ultimate arbiter of law and order and Congress being merely an advisory body.  President Mitt Romney could simply suspend all of Obamacare permanently, he could just suspend laws hither and thither until he’s effectively abolished the progressive income tax and imposed a flat tax in its place.  President Hilary Clinton could announce that Congress is moving too slow on immigration reform and simply legalize everyone by suspending all statutes to the contrary.  Some of these policies would be good; some of them would be bad.  But *none* of them, consensus-based representative democracy.  This is precisely why the Constitution requires the President to swear

Which brings me to question 2: If the President has violated the law in this way

The normal answer is “lawsuit, nobody has standing to sue the President over this, so the courts can’t adjudicate it.

For its part, we hate the employer mandate, so we are all for suspending it,” and they actually passed a bill, [HR 2667](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr2667ih/pdf/BILLS-113hr2667ih.pdf) that gave the President statutory authority to make this change.  Shockingly, rather than accept the legal fig leaf this bill would have provided, the White House [issued a veto threat](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/113/saphr2667r_20130716.pdf) (presumably for political reasons; the GOP was exploiting the issue for political points) and HR2667 is now dead in the Senate.

This seems to leave us between a rock and a hard place.  The courts can’t force the President’s hand unless someone can find standing to challenge the action

It seems like a very strange thing for Congress to impeach the President for suspending a law that a majority of Congress aggressively opposes to begin with

I don’t like the idea of impeaching somebody over an issue that is closely tied to broader questions of health care reform,” and clearly refusing to do so has to carry a price, or our democracy fails.  So, if I were in Congress today, I’d probably move to open an impeachment proceeding.

On the one hand, so it could take some pushing.  Let’s discuss!

* a certain region that had the most shootings

then I feel like we could effectively legislate to prevent these kinds of incidents. As it is

From my research from both the CDC and the Guttermach Institute the majority of abortions are performed for single white women between the ages of 20-24 and only 10.5% of them actually are due to rape

Currently viability is somewhat weakly defined, not per person basis (it isn't calculated per fetus).  

The survival rate for a fetus is 25 percent in the 23rd week, when a newborn doesn't require a ventilator to breathe, it has a 90 percent chance of survival, this is of course assuming that there is adequate medical equipment to provide life support.

* Most people do not have the time to really look into an issue's fine points and make informed decisions about who/what they are voting for. Extremely biased information sources make it even harder.

* Groups always have an incentive to vote for handouts/money now as opposed to thinking about how that money or handout will affect society in the long term.

* Democracy encourages politicians to strive to fulfill seemingly immediately justifiable social needs

* Constant switching of leaders might make them more worried about ""political capital"" and worrying about keeping their voters happy rather than make the maybe unpopular optimal economic decision. 

* Democracy might make people who are good at discourse/talking leaders rather than people who are experts on an issue but are more reserved and quiet. \

Let's think about this. I understand hardliners would be absolutely against this but I think there are plenty of benefits to be had.

* The first question needed to be answered is

I don't think it would. There hasn't been a terrorist attack since 2001. Canada and U.S. share the largest border in the world

* Would the U.S and Canada save a lot of money by dissolving these borders? 

Again

* What are the economic advantages?

This is really the cog of my argument. But I have trouble finding positive economic advantages for Canada...please help! I live in Buffalo, and our airport accounts for probably half of our GDP. I can only imagine the further benefits by opening the borders...not just for Buffalo, but Seattle, Detroit, and even Cleveland, Portland, and Syracuse. This is helped by the U.S.'s weak dollar.

* Would this increase tourism?

I think so. I host foreigners through couch surfing and often times people from the Czech, they're forced to stay on the Whittier American side

I would also like to propose an opt out clause for border states/provinces that so not want to participate ie. Quebec. This should be an entertaining conversation!

A key piece of this is showing that countries with high debt have issues with economic growth. Herndon found an error in the data sheets:

The basic premise is based around a Centrist Party that isn’t a halfway point between the two current parties

Relevant sections from The Centrist Manifesto:

“After all, an understanding of the economic costs of taxation and regulation, and a healthy skepticism of what government can and cannot accomplish.

And there is a lot to like about the Democrats: a concern for working people, a long-standing concern for the environment, and a recognition that government can play a crucial role in protecting us from the most egregious abuses of capitalism.”

Rather than focusing on the House or the Presidency

Wheelan notes that, but these tend to be parties emerging from the political fringe or ones whose ideology is tied to single issues (e.g. Green Party). Such parties, he argues, are incapable of appealing to the moderate American population at large. When you consider the races to the political fringe which occur during political primaries and the subsequent race back to the center during the general election, Wheelan argues that this provides an interesting opportunity for moderates. Why tailor your party to ideas which are not necessarily successful in general elections? Instead, why not create a party that would be successful in a general election from the get-go, one that occupies the political middle and is built around pragmatism and compromise?

I agree with calls to ""change the rules"" by going to systems like IRV, but those sorts of reforms would be extremely slow moving compared to some kind of moderate grassroots movement. I'm happy to be proven wrong, but a ""radical center"" (even if a Centrist Party isn't the way it manifests itself) that energizes the middle actually sounds somewhat realistic.

Since Members and staff still technically meet the definition of federal employees qualified for the FEHBP,900 for individual and $10,000 for family coverage.

The White House is claiming the clause means the opposite

Millionaire Senators and the affluent professionals who are chiefs of staff

It would have been fairer and less corrosive to the rule of law had Congress simply passed a bill giving their workers a raise to make up for the lost compensation of dropping out of the FEHBP.

To put this rate in context, the [FTC received about 2.3 million complaints of identity theft](http://www.ftc.gov/sentinel/reports/sentinel-annual-reports/sentinel-cy2010.pdf). That's a rate of about one reported identity fraud per 500 creditholders, per year. Even taken as a percentage of the total number of electronic financial transactions per year [(about 921 billion from 2001-2010, extrapolating from this Federal Reserve study)](http://www.frbservices.org/files/communications/pdf/research/2007_payments_study.pdf), that's one report of fraud per 397,000 individual transactions - closer to the rate of confirmed voter fraud but artificially small IMO since individual cases of ID thefts are often associated with more than one individual transaction. I'm thinking its easier for an ID thief to run up ten fraudulent transactions than for a fraudulent voter to vote ten times.

So, proponents of voter ID laws claim that the system has few safeguards against fraudulent voting - and meet voter fraud statistics with shock and disbelief.

Though illegal immigration dominates the debate, technology, engineering, and math) seem to be of particular concern. Last November the STEM Jobs Act died in the Senate because Democrats opposed the elimination of the diversity visa. Now a new bill, the Immigration Innovation Act, seeks to do approximately the same without courting equal controversy. 

As an engineering student, America has been filled with doom and gloom over its state of math and science education and the number, as well as quality, of its scientists and engineers. One can find proclamations of a STEM deficit every year over the decades, to the extent that it seems like an utterly intractable problem. Interestingly enough, we live in a free-market society with relatively free movement of labor, where market forces are supposed to ensure that no permanent deficit of talent persists over time. 

As you can probably tell by now, he was asked if America has a shortage of engineers, to which he flatly responded, ""Not at all"". Of course, whether this is true depends on whom you ask. Technology companies, understandably, are always complaining about failing to find good (read: cheap) talent. Professional organizations like the IEEE, strongly [oppose](http://blogs.computerworld.com/the_h_1b_battle_the_war_within_ieee) such a view. 

What I'm interested in is why both sides of the aisle seem to agree on everything ""STEM"". Why don't we import more foreign lawyers, God forbid, politicians? I'm only half-joking in the last. 

The answer, STEM is a very abstract concept, one that is conveniently always on the ""good"" side of political debates. Who can argue against having more scientists and engineers? It's incredibly easy to say ""I'm for STEM education"" or ""I'm for more STEM immigrants"". 

I welcome the idea of more educated and skilled immigrants

I attended public school in America (specifically Tennessee) from 1999 to 2012. We were mandated to take the state required test from about grades 3 to 8. For high school graduation, and English. However, I have to note, one only had to get between 50-70% of the questions right on the tests to satisfy the requirement.

However, most of us thought they were very easy, and then we got snacks and extra recess. In middle school, we didn't get any of these things, but we still found the tests pretty easy. 

As for the high school tests, took one set of tests (Algebra I) in middle school. To me, it'd been the easiest test all year. As for the other two, I took them freshman year, and again, they'd been pretty easy. In fact, they were considered to be our exam grade for the course, the graduation requirements were changed for new students so I'm not sure what had happened after that.

The thing is, but I'm not so sure that there is any other way to ensure that students are learning what they are supposed to. I don't think that standardized tests are able to correctly measure mastery of material, but I can't think of any other practical method.

What initiated this question is what I believe are two examples that this debate over minimum wage hasn't hit the sweet spot yet.  I'm sure you've all seen them on either Reddit or Facebook at some time or another.  The first is McDonalds ""sample budget"".  The other is the map of how many hours it would take to work at minimum wage to afford a two-bedroom apartment.

I find it problematic in the former example that they suggest that you should work over 70 hours per week to survive on minimum wage on ones own.  Suggesting, I question whether if the benchmark for a minimum wage should be a two bedroom apartment. I am not convinced that the minimum wage should be designed to take care of more than one person. So that map implies to me that maybe people are aiming too high in terms of a minimum wage.

For a base to start (as I know it's much easier to tear apart an argument and come up with an alternative than to start cold).  I believe that it's a fair social contract that if you work full-time equivalent (40-45 hours/week-- though I fully realize that many employers intentionally don't offer this many hours to lower level employees for ""flexibility"")

I think it's also fair to expect that two minimum wage incomes be enough to support a child, not to mention that it's inhumane.

Ten years after 9/11, a natural tendency to say that the attacks changed everything. But a decade on, such conclusions seem unjustified. September 11 did alter the focus and foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration. But the administration's new approach, one that garnered so much praise and so much criticism, was less transformative than contemporaries thought. Much of it was consistent with long-term trends in U.S. foreign policy, and much has been continued by President Barack Obama. Some aspects merit the scorn often heaped on them; other aspects merit praise that was only grudging in the moment. Wherever one positions oneself, it is time to place the era in context and assess it as judiciously as possible.

**BEFORE AND AFTER**

Before 9/11, Libya, and North Korea. At many meetings of the National Security Council, officials debated the pros and cons of a new sanctions regime against Saddam Hussein's dictatorial government in Baghdad; they also discussed what would be done if U.S. planes enforcing the no-fly zones over Iraq were shot down. Little was agreed on.

Top officials did not consider terrorism or radical Islamism a high priority. Richard Clarke, and CIA Director George Tenet might say the lights were blinking red. But Secretary of State Colin Powell, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice were not convinced. Nor was Bush. In August 2001, he went to his ranch for a long vacation. Osama bin Laden was not his overriding concern.

Bush's foreign policy and defense advisers were trying to define a strategic framework and adapt U.S. armed forces to the so-called revolution in military affairs. The president himself was beginning to speak more about free trade and remaking U.S. foreign aid. During the presidential campaign, on the domestic arena -- tax cuts, education reform, faith-based voluntarism, energy policy. And then, suddenly, disaster struck.

In response to the attacks, rendition, and, in a few cases, torture.

The administration announced that it was adopting a policy of anticipatory self-defense -- essentially

The administration also emphasized democratization and the notion of a democratic peace. These became key ingredients of the Bush doctrine, in January 2005. ""The survival of liberty in our land depends on the success of liberty in other lands."" Three years after that, as she was about to leave office, Rice also presented this position, saying that she and her colleagues had come to recognize ""that democratic state-building is now an urgent component of our national interest.""

After 9/11

Alongside its security policies, and economic development. It reconfigured and hugely augmented the United States' foreign aid commitments, increasing economic assistance, for example, from about $13 billion in 2000 to about $34 billion in 2008. The administration fought disease, becoming the largest donor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. It negotiated a deal reducing strategic warheads with Russia, and smoothed over its rocky start with China. And it continued to try to thwart the proliferation of WMD while forging ahead with its work on a ballistic missile defense system. These efforts complemented each other

Most of these policies -- preemption (really prevention), democratization, free trade, economic growth, alliance cohesion, and great-power partnerships -- were outlined in the administration's 2002 National Security Strategy, a document composed not in the Office of the Vice President or the Pentagon by neoconservatives but in the office of then National Security Adviser Rice, an outside consultant

September 11, as did a sense of U.S. power, a pride in national institutions and values, a feeling of responsibility for the safety of the public, and a sense of guilt over having allowed the country to be struck. As the White House adviser Karl Rove would write, ""We worked to numb ourselves to the fact of an attack on American soil that involved the death of thousands."" Reshaping U.S. policy after 9/11 meant resolving the ambiguities and shattering the paralysis that had marked the first nine months of the administration. Before 9/11, the United States' primacy and security had been taken for granted; after 9/11, defend its allies

**AMERICA'S QUEST FOR PRIMACY**

Some observers have compared the impact of 9/11 on U.S. policy to the impact on U.S. policy of North Korea's attack on South Korea in June 1950. Back then, the secretary of state, and Paul Nitze, the director of policy planning at the State Department, knew they had to reconfirm the United States' preponderance of power, recently shattered by the Soviets' first nuclear test. They knew they had to increase the United States' military capabilities, regain the country's self-confidence, equality

Whether or not one thinks that such analogies are appropriate, sought to preserve and reassert the primacy of the United States while they struggled to thwart any follow-up attacks on U.S. citizens or U.S. territory. Like Acheson and Nitze, they were certain that they were protecting a way of life, that the configuration of power in the international arena and the mitigation of threats abroad were vital to the preservation of freedom at home.

More than Acheson and Nitze, undercut the very goals they were designed to achieve.

Thus, the United States and its power were thrown into disrepute.

U.S. primacy was also damaged by the unexpected cost of the protracted wars, the U.S. debt held by foreign governments climbed steadily, from about 13 percent at the end of the Cold War to close to 30 percent at the end of the Bush years. U.S. financial strength and flexibility had been seriously eroded.

Rather than preventing peer competitors from rising, China's growing military capabilities, especially its new class of submarines and its new cruise and ballistic missiles, endangered the United States' supremacy in East and Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, the U.S. trade deficit with China rose from $83 billion in 2001 to $273 billion in 2010, and total U.S. indebtedness to China rose from $78 billion in 2001 to over $1.1 trillion in 2011.

Rather than preserving regional balances, Iraq was largely eliminated as a counterbalance to Iran, Iran's ability to meddle beyond its borders increased, and the United States' ability to mediate Israeli-Palestinian negotiations declined.

Rather than thwarting proliferation, their countries' survival depended on possessing a WMD deterrent (a message that has probably been reinforced by the Obama administration's decision to intervene in Libya in 2011 following Libya's renunciation of its nuclear capability several years earlier).

Rather than promoting free markets

Rather than promoting liberty, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. According to Freedom House's 2010 annual report on the state of global political rights and civil liberties, ""2009 was the fourth straight year in which more countries saw declines in freedom than saw improvements, the longest continuous period of deterioration in the nearly forty year history of the report.""

And rather than thwarting terrorism and radical Islamism, and possibly so did the number of jihadists. The U.S. government's own National Intelligence Estimate in 2007 acknowledged that the country lived in a heightened threat environment. A 2008 report on counterterrorism from a respected nonpartisan think tank, the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, concluded, ""Since 2002-3, the overall US position in the GWOT [global war on terror] has slipped."" Although the United States had captured and killed terrorist leaders and operatives, disrupted terrorist networks, and built constructive partnerships with counterterrorist agencies abroad, the resurgence of Iranian regional influence

Criticism is, U.S. officials confronted agonizing challenges and choices. In an atmosphere of extreme fear and real danger, their record included important accomplishments and admirable initiatives. They kept pressure on al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations and may well have prevented other attacks on U.S. soil and citizens. They pulled off a major nonproliferation success in getting Libya to abandon its nuclear program, formed a strong relationship with rising powers such as India, and kept relations with China and Russia from boiling over. They reformed and reinvigorated foreign aid, exerted global leadership in the fight against infectious diseases, tried to keep the Doha Round of trade talks moving forward

These successes were outweighed by the administration's failure to achieve many of its most important goals. But critics are wrong to say that the policies that failed were radically new or surprising. They were rooted in the past.

**9/11 IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE**

Preemptive and preventive actions were not invented by Bush; his vice president, as were the subsequent U.S. military occupations of countries such as Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Later, President Franklin Roosevelt justified his resort to anticipatory self-defense against German ships in the Atlantic prior to the United States' entry into World War II by saying, ""When you see a rattlesnake poised to strike, you do not wait until he has struck before you crush him."" Some 20 years on, President John F. Kennedy determined that he could not allow a Soviet deployment of offensive weapons about 90 miles from U.S. shores, and he unilaterally imposed a quarantine -- essentially a blockade and an act of belligerency -- around Cuba during the missile crisis. In Kennedy's view, notwithstanding the fact that it brought the country to the brink of nuclear war. Responding to the threat of terrorism in the mid-1990s, and Clinton, that ""history will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have entered

Bush and his advisers, former Vice President Al Gore declared, ""There really is something to be said for occasionally putting diplomacy aside and laying one's cards on the table. There is value in calling evil by its name."" He continued, ""Even if we give first priority to the destruction of terrorist networks, and even if we succeed, there are still governments that could bring great harm. And there is a clear case that one of those governments in particular represents a virulent threat in a class to itself: Iraq. . . . A final reckoning with that government should be on the table."" A few days later, then Senator Joe Biden interrupted Powell as he was testifying before Congress. ""One way or another, ""Saddam has got to go, Sandy Berger, saying that he ""was

Conventional wisdom says that Democratic officials might have acted differently after 9/11, was neither especially bold nor unprecedented. Its quest to avoid peer competitors resembled the U.S. effort to preserve an atomic monopoly after World War II, achieve military preponderance in the wake of the Korean War, preserve military superiority during the Kennedy years, regain superiority during the Reagan years, and nurture unipolarity after the Soviet Union's collapse. Clinton's Joint Chiefs of Staff embraced the term ""full-spectrum superiority"" to describe the country's strategic intentions. It was during the Clinton years, not the Bush years, Eric Edelman

The similarities extend to rhetorical tropes and ideological aspirations as well. It has become fashionable in some circles to excoriate the ideological fervor of the Bush team. But the affirmation of democratic values was hardly new. It was integral to the Wilsonian and Achesonian visions of the world, President Jimmy Carter talking about human rights, and President Ronald Reagan extolling the U.S. role in the world. Their rhetorical tropes resemble Bush's, as do Obama's in his recent speeches. And like his predecessors (and his successor), Bush had little trouble deviating from this message when it suited his administration's strategic or material interests.

Many argue that U.S. policy after 9/11 was distinguished by its unilateralism. But the instinct to act independently, dating back to President George Washington's Farewell Address and President Thomas Jefferson's first inaugural speech. During the Cold War, U.S. officials always reserved the right to act unilaterally, even while they nurtured alliances. Clinton's last National Security Strategy, and Obama's first, explicitly did the same. There is little doubt that Bush's advisers, inspired by fear and hubris as well as a sense of responsibility and pangs of guilt, they also articulated a desire to strengthen alliances

Bush is linked even more closely to those who came before and after by his embrace of the open door policy and global free trade. His 2002 National Security Strategy, nurturing free markets, opening societies, and building the infrastructure of democracy. These U.S. policies have a long heritage, dating back to the ""open door notes"" of Secretary of State John Hay, President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, and Franklin Roosevelt's Atlantic Charter, if less memorable

**GRAPPLING WITH TRAGEDY**

The long-term significance of 9/11 for U.S. foreign policy, an unwarranted assault on innocent civilians, and a provocation of monumental proportions. But they did not change the world or transform the long-term trajectory of U.S. grand strategy. The United States' quest for primacy, its desire to lead the world, its preference for an open door and free markets, its concern with military supremacy, its readiness to act unilaterally when deemed necessary, its sense of indispensability -- all these remained

What the attacks did do was alter the United States' threat perception and highlight the global significance of nonstate actors and radical Islamism. They alerted the country to the fragility of its security and the anger, particularly in parts of the Islamic world. But if 9/11 highlighted vulnerabilities, its aftermath illustrated how the mobilization of U.S. power, unless disciplined, calibrated, and done in conjunction with allies, has the potential to undermine the global commons as well as to protect them.

Rather than heaping blame or casting praise on the Bush administration, accepting universal conscription, or implementing a realistic energy policy. Americans can recognize that there is evil in the world, as Obama reminded his Nobel audience in December 2009, and they can admit, as he did, that force has a vital role to play in the affairs of humankind. But they can also recognize that the exercise of power can grievously injure those whom they wish to help and can undercut the very goals they seek to achieve. Americans can acknowledge the continuities in their interests and values yet wrestle with the judgments and tradeoffs that are required to design a strategy that works in a post-Cold War era, the enemies more elusive

The bitterness that has poisoned American public discourse in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and the wars they triggered should be turned into sorrowful reflection about how fear, and power can do so much harm in the quest to do good. This remains the tragedy of American diplomacy that William Appleman Williams, the prominent historian, instructed Americans to confront a half century ago.

Since then I've been attacked because of that, because they were so ""matter of fact"", because people, including my friends, my mother, told me ""Well you have to stand with your people"" like it's some obvious cosmic rule got me thinking….

Why the fuck do I have to ""stand"" with some group, no nothing just because my great great great…..something and all of theirs great great great great something came down from the same Ural mountains to the Balkans in the freaking 6th century?

I am first of all a man, Serb would come at number 5 or 6 on that list.

If I ""stand by someone"" I will stand by him because he/she is a good person. I will not stand by someone just because we might have similar DNK

Isn't that was basically Americans are? You guys have no ""common history"" (at least not in a way other nations do) no bloodline to connect you. You have ideals and ideas of what America is.

The first thing to keep in mind is that downvoting on r/NeutralPolitics should be extremely rare. Even if you dislike someone’s post or disagree with it, never downvote evidence unless you have a defensible reason to believe that the evidence is false.

Remember: we all have reasons that we are putting forth our respective arguments, you are giving them a chance either to explain themselves better or realize that they might be making false assumptions. Through this positive engagement, the conversation can be mutually beneficial and provide an example for others to follow.

If you do downvote a post or comment, point them in the direction of the FAQ so that they can educate themselves. Be constructive about it. Yes, they should have read it already, but not everyone will. You never know, your post might inspire them to be a positive member of the community. 

Sometimes

* Flaming
* Memes
* Off-topic responses that are clearly trying to derail the conversation

The general idea is that only posts that need to be reported deserve to be downvoted. Instead

*Which brings us to our second topic…*


**Upvoting**

Where there is legitimate evidence, there should be upvotes. Upvote content that you think promotes civil and intelligent discussion. Upvote redditors who are engaging in a debate that provides a positive example for the community. Upvote someone admitting that they are wrong. Upvote outstanding use of logic where evidence can’t be had.

Be liberal with your upvotes as long as the posts deserve them. By providing this positive feedback

In [Affordable Excellence: The Singapore Healthcare Story] (http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Press/Books/2013/affordableexcellence/AffordableExcellencePDF.pdf) William A. Haseltine explaines why 
&gt;Singapore has achieved extraordinary results both in the high quality of its healthcare system and in controlling the cost of care. In per capita terms and as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
   
Hasseltine’s book mentions an essential White Paper issued in 1993 by a ministerial committee entitled [“Aﬀordable Health Care.”] (http://www.moh.gov.sg/content/dam/moh_web/Publications/Reports/1993/Affordable_Health_Care.pdf) which set forth ﬁve fundamental elements of Singaporean medical policy:  

&gt; 1 Become a healthy nation by promoting good health;  
 
This means that the Singapore government is very engaged in disease prevention and actively promotes a healthy lifestyle.  

&gt; 2 Promote individual responsibility for one’s own health and avoid overreliance on state welfare or third-party medical insurance;  
 
[Medisafe] (http://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/costs_and_financing/schemes_subsidies/medisave.html) is a mandatory medical saving scheme that is central to keeping medical cost down by making Singaporeans pay for their own healthcare costs and that of their family while providing guidelines on what the medisafe funds can be used for.  

&gt; 3 Ensure good and aﬀordable basic medical services for all Singaporeans;  
  
The government provides a basic medical package that is available for all Singaporeans and provided by hospitals receiving subsidies.

Should standardized tests be kept as a method of rating schools/teachers/students? Should it be used for rating some not other others? What are the alternatives to standardized testing and what are their advantages?

Some of the points I've been considering (I haven't made my mind up how I feel about them):

- Term limits would seem to limit the experience our representatives have with the legislative process... they'd have to learn the ropes afresh every term, afresh every term, in effect. This seems like it would make things pretty inefficient. This could be good or bad, I suppose.

- Lobbyists have no term limits and setting term limits on representatives makes lobbyists the people in Washington with the most experience / tenure. Seems like this would not be great

- Freedom of speech: if people like their representative

- Term limits might also make it easier to get rid of entrenched corruption

- If people want to vote out senators they don't like

- I recognize that the legislative and executive branches are, but I'm not sure I fully support presidential term limits either. Same basic reasoning.

So this time I'll start by citing a PDF which has a lot of sources listed and a lot of hard data and facts.  I will admit that this data is cherry picked in order to paint a positive view of concealed carry and it's effect on crime.

http://concealedcampus.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2011/12/ccw_gun_facts.pdf

I think the most important things to note from that are that states which enacted concealed carry laws saw their crime rates drop faster than they had been dropping

The other important information is that concealed carriers are relatively unlikely to commit crimes compared with the general population.  The tiny number of CCW permits which have been revoked are a good measurement of how often concealed carriers commit crimes

It also dispels some common myths with evidence

[Here](http://www.sj-r.com/top-stories/x1526463189/Concealed-carry-laws-Experts-debate-impact?zc_p=0) is an article discussing one of the most commonly cited studies that determined that concealed carry laws decrease crime rates

For the people who claim that other countries with strict gun control prove that allowing civilians to own and carry guns increases crime, and an even higher rate than the US, despite their strict gun control laws.  I am aware England's homicide rate is much lower than the US rate, but that has always been that way, even before England banned handguns.  I claim that the difference in homicide and crime rates are due mainly to cultural differences, and not to gun control laws.

We can also look at examples from other nations, and a mandate that every able bodied male keep a fully automatic military rifle in their home as a part of mandatory military duty.  They have a very low homicide rate, of between .6 and 1, while the UK is at 1.23 in the most recent data, and the US is at 4.8.  Compare that with a country like Mexico, which has some of the most strict gun control laws in the world, and you see they have a rate of 18.  This goes to show that sometimes gun control laws are ineffective, and a lot of homicide.

So in conclusion, from a lot of different countries with widely different cultures and laws.  In general I don't think I can make many conclusions about how concealed carry laws would impact nations other than the US, but I think there is enough data to claim that concealed carry laws in the US are correlated with a decrease in crime rates.  Whether or not that translates similarly to other countries is impossible to determine based on my current knowledge.  I do think there is good evidence that England hasn't benefited greatly from their gun ban, and their country wouldn't fall apart if they did legalize concealed carry, but i'll leave that to the Brits to decide.",,False,t5_2tk0i,True

My understanding is that there is universal understanding among economists that a carbon tax is the most efficient -- i.e., and therefore faces political problems. As a result, American politicians tend to favor ""command and control"" policies (i.e., fuel efficiency standards, pollution standards) that hide the costs of regulation but are ultimately more expensive. This is because they force companies to make inefficient trades, have perverse effects that increase emissions, and add regulatory burden. Therefore if we were to institute a carbon tax

I believe that the popular objections to a carbon tax (economic cost, which is a problem politically, but it is actually better for the economy than alternative regulations. Regressivity is easily addressed by increasing support for low-income households. Generally, a small percentage of total revenue is necessary to offset the effects for poor households.

The only other alternative is not addressing the problem with any policy

**MY OPINION:** It also seems to me that the risks are extremely serious that if climate change hits 4 degrees C we could see failing crops

Such suits, excessive, unwarranted and a waste of resources. Companies, municipalities, medical practitioners and other professionals argue that the suits drive up the cost of liability and malpractice insurance, which then gets passed on to the consumers.

When tort reform policies are promoted in the US

However

In the wake of the tragic [explosion at the West Fertilizer Company](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/us/huge-blast-at-texas-fertilizer-plant.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;) in West

Fourteen people lost their lives on April 17th

Over the previous decade

The conflicting assessments of such measures bring up a number of questions in light of the recent tragedy:

* Does tort reform introduce [moral hazard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard) into the calculations with respect to dangerous industries?
* Is it possible that liability limits actually encourage a degree of negligence on the part of companies? They can implement cost-cutting measures, without worrying that the potential cost of lawsuits if something goes wrong will exceed the savings made by implementing those measures.     
* Is it possible that the plant was built in this town
* Even if tort reforms do introduce greater risks, would you approve of companies relocating there, bringing in more jobs and economic growth, knowing that the tradeoff might be your safety?     
* If your family had one of those homes
* Are there other ways to address the problem of frivolous lawsuits while maintaining high incentives for companies to be vigilant against negligence?

**The people who are in charge of this country don't want to fix it**

We have a whopping two ideologies to choose from out of an entire political spectrum. Why is this?

Nobody makes policy for the good of the country anymore. They can't. It's all about making money for your next campaign. Republicans are in bed with oil

**Politicians take advantage of a population that is consistently and progressively becoming more and more ignorant and/or apathetic..**

Look at what's going on in the media right now. Both candidates are talking about the economy. There are other issues, you already have a budget as is. If that is their only plan to fix things in terms of jobs and the economy, it won't help. Personal debt is a much more significant factor than the national debt in how far the economy has fallen.


EDIT: *People being in debt leads to less money being invested in the economy and less faith in the economy. Low faith in the economy results in lesser investment in government bonds which leads to a greater rate in our debt being bought up, a large amount of personal debt within the economy only accelerates the process. If the internal economy was healthy, it could help hinder it. In addition, private debt undermines supply side economics due to the government's inability to mandate where stimulus money is spent (as it should be). As a result, that money goes into paying off personal debt as opposed to, let's say, a small or growing business that would take that money and use it to expand and further grow the economy.*

 You would think that Obama would point this out, the people are completely buying into each side bashing the other and nobody seems to realize that *if each side just talks about who they aren't, what's wrong with the other side, and what they wouldn't do, there is NO motivation to change ANYTHING.* Every promise will already have been fulfilled just for being who they are because the only promise that was made was to not be the other guy. It's a perpetual cycle of bullshit.


**The media has no integrity anymore**

This is obviously on a relative scale to how things used to be. Everything is based on ratings. Everything. It determines you budget for your programs and your resources as a result. What happens when you mix what should be an objective presentation of information with a desire to be entertaining? Two things: First, you get subjective viewpoints from people which sways the news in one direction with a massive amount of bias. This is how we get networks like Fox News and MSNBC. Eventually, that bias gets so mixed in with the sensationalism that it's just lie after lie after lie. Just look at Fox during the healthcare debate or MSNBC on Romney's companies. How do people fulfill their duty to be informed when news outlets are all swayed to one radical viewpoint and the politicians all spin in the same way? And this is just assuming that these people are intelligent enough to recognize it and care enough to want to.


**People keep saying what's wrong but nobody says how to fix it.**

This is the most tiresome part of politics. It happens in the news. It happens in the house. It happens in the senate. It happens on this sub. Well I'm going to provide a few points of reform to fix these issues:

**1. Exclusively public financing of campaigns.**

I'd say that we cut out the middle man, and even if they were, it wouldn't matter anymore. Not to mention the fact that more limited funds for campaigning would make candidates use their money more wisely.

Currently in this country

**2. Ban negative ads.**

Crazy, right? My philosophy: If Mexico can do it, then why the hell can't we?

EDIT: Has been addressed several times. See other comments please.

**3. Eliminate the ratings system for media outlets.**

Replace it with something else. Keep it private, those that subscribe to it are consistently the most uninformed citizens out there. 

What does that tell you?

**4. Eliminate the electoral college.**

The electoral college is an archaic part of our system that was around back when counting the popular vote was implausible. What's more? The people that vote ""for us"" are all people that were involved in somebody's campaign. If you can count our votes

**5. Hold congressional elections every four years offsetting the presidency

This is a good idea for a few reasons: First, there is more variety in congressional political viewpoints, and this should be fostered. If congressional elections are not overshadowed by the presidential elections, people should pay more attention to them. Furthermore, congress has substantially more power to make significant changes to the things that we want to change in government than the president does. The federal branch is nothing more than a tool to enforce what the legislative branch decides. By ensuring that terms are four years long, we will avoid repeating the cycle of one year of action and one year of campaigning. Term limits also foster a better work ethic and motivation to get things done.

**6. Make philosophy a core subject in our school systems.**

I firmly believe that this is the only way to save our next generation. We teach our children logic and we give them the ability to distinguish objective and subjective information. They will be able to reason things and come up with ideas in an intelligent manner

This is just what I see and think. If you disagree

you can find the transcript here http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/read-transcript-of-obamas-speech-on-counterterrorism-policy

In the speech he makes some pretty interesting statements on 
1.the future of the war on terror
""We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, nor any President, can promise the total defeat of terror. We will never erase the evil that lies in the hearts of some human beings, nor stamp out every danger to our open society. What we can do – what we must do – is dismantle networks that pose a direct danger, and make it less likely for new groups to gain a foothold, all while maintaining the freedoms and ideals that we defend.

2.Drone warfare
""much of the criticism about drone strikes – at home and abroad – understandably centers on reports of civilian casualties. There is a wide gap between U.S. assessments of such casualties, a risk that exists in all wars...But as Commander-in-Chief, I must weigh these heartbreaking tragedies against the alternatives. To do nothing in the face of terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties – not just in our cities at home and facilities abroad, where terrorists seek a foothold... Where foreign governments cannot or will not effectively stop terrorism in their territory, the primary alternative to targeted, lethal action is the use of conventional military options... The result would be more U.S. deaths, more Blackhawks down, and an inevitable mission creep in support of such raids that could easily escalate into new wars.

3.Civil liberties
""the choices we make about war can impact – in sometimes unintended ways – the openness and freedom on which our way of life depends. And that is why I intend to engage Congress about the existing Authorization to Use Military Force, we may be drawn into more wars we don’t need to fight, or continue to grant Presidents unbound powers more suited for traditional armed conflicts between nation states. So I look forward to engaging Congress and the American people in efforts to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF’s mandate. And I will not sign laws designed to expand this mandate further. Our systematic effort to dismantle terrorist organizations must continue. But this war, like all wars, must end. That’s what history advises. That’s what our democracy demands.""

4.Guantanamo bay
""As President, under President Bush, some 530 detainees were transferred from GTMO with Congress’s support. No person has ever escaped from one of our super-max or military prisons in the United States. Our courts have convicted hundreds of people for terrorism-related offenses, including some who are more dangerous than most GTMO detainees. Given my Administration’s relentless pursuit of al Qaeda’s leadership, there is no justification beyond politics for Congress to prevent us from closing a facility that should never have been opened.Today, I once again call on Congress to lift the restrictions on detainee transfers from GTMO. I have asked the Department of Defense to designate a site in the United States where we can hold military commissions. I am appointing a new, senior envoy at the State Department and Defense Department whose sole responsibility will be to achieve the transfer of detainees to third countries. I am lifting the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen, we will transfer detainees who have been cleared to go to other countries. Where appropriate

1367361867.0,1dfy92,"In terms of electoral systems, is stability more important than fair representation, and are the two mutually exclusive?",nwob,53,16, but it's more of a spectrum than two camps.  

Majoritarian systems tend to produce strong majorities and thus strong governments, despite only gaining 50.8% of the vote.^2  Under FPTP, many votes are squandered in 'safe seats' and only voters in marginal areas have significant impact on the outcome.  Smaller parties are discriminated against, as are those with geographically diverse support bases.  No minor party has, in recent history, gained a seat in the US Congress, for example, for example

Proportional systems, it could be argued that such a complex and mercurial system of parties can only lead to gridlock and indecision.  Another example is Weimar Germany, which, between 1918 and 1933 saw a rapid succession of governments come and go as the country's underlying problems were left without address.  Far be it from me to invoke Godwin's Law, but it has been argued that the adoption of a PR system was one of the factors that hamstrung German politics and left an opening for the Nazi Party to gain an electoral stronghold.

Of course, Wales and New Zealand, or STV as used in Northern Ireland (which is my personal favourite) being just two examples.

One thing is that conspiracies carry stories that are relevant to the news, if there's a story about the Boston bombings, then it also has to do with police corruption, telecommunications spying, government transparency or another major issue. This means that a conspiracy touches not only on relevant topics, but on larger issues as well.

Another thing about conspiracists I find impressive is focus on a core set of ideas or beliefs about government and society. On the one hand, there often are problems in bureaucracies of properly implementing the will of the people without the creep of moneyed interests in the implementation.

I believe that at any one time there are a number of basic issues in politics that address a number of complex issues on a regional scale. So, incompetence, and other major issues in bureaucracies.

So there seems to be some quality that seems to run through all politics

First, right wing socialists and environmentalists, and left wing nationalists and militarists. Therefore, what distinguishes left from right cannot be what policy you propose, but your MOTIVE for proposing it. It's not individualism vs. communitarianism. The liberal project began as a defense of individual rights against patriarchal monarchy. But nationalism (the idea that each nation should have its own country) is about as communitarian as you can get and it got its start as a left wing ideology. Individualist strains run thick through both the left and the right today. While this is an important axis on which to evaluate politics, it is not the essential difference between left and right.

It is not Socialism vs. Capitalism. Like political liberalism, technocratic Taylorites and Fordists, some, though not all, of the fascists, and some post colonial nationalists like Nasser. And while capitalism has its home on the right today, it's not entirely comfortable there. I realize most redditors are pretty liberal, for a variety of reasons. It's not Traditionalism vs. Change. Here I think we hit closer to the mark, principally the fascists and technocrats. Left wing traditionalists are fairly uncommon

The difference, the essential leftist motive is to tear down hierarchies while the right winger wants to preserve them. The right sees hierarchy as either good, necessary, natural, or some combination thereof, essential to human life, while the left either rejects them on principle, these attitudes toward hierarchy explain much of politics. For example, with everyone is empowered equally while monarchy is the opposite. Of course, but different sellers had very different ends in mind.

On the left, that business interests were their primary opposition. Fascism was the original “third way” project, promising security and subsidy to big business in exchange for tilting the balance towards labor. Rightist fascists like Phibun, Franco, and Salazar didn’t much care won the labor/capital war, but thought that the conflict would tear society apart. Both groups thus had similar goals (controlling and moderating labor and capital) and thus adopted similar institutional structures, but for very different reasons. The rightists wanted a stable

Hierarchy also explains why neither the left nor the right really embraces capitalism. Capitalism requires winners and losers which offends the leftist sensibility even if the result is pareto optimal, the left wanting to make people equal, and the right wanting and orderly system that maximizes productivity, because no one is entirely happy with the outcomes of capitalism.",,False,,1374711633.0,t3_r6ci7

Nearly every major lawsuit involving government surveillance programs has been dismissed or hindered due to the issue of proper legal standing

In 2006 [the ACLU filed a class action lawsuit against the NSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union_v._National_Security_Agency), only to be dismissed by the appeals court on the issue of standing. The case was ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court, which turned down the case for deliberation. In 2008 [the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a lawsuit against the NSA](https://www.eff.org/cases/jewel) with similar claims. The case was dismissed in district court over lack of standing. in his opinion, the presiding Judge Vaugahn Walker bluntly stated [""A citizen may not gain standing by claiming a right to have the government follow the law.""](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/01/nsa-spy-cases-tossed/)The dismissal was overturned in appeals court, and as of December 2012 the case is still ongoing.

Also in 2006 the EFF filed a lawsuit, Congress passed the [FISA Amendments Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FISA_Amendments_Act), amending the [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Act), the 1976 framework for foreign intelligence activities by the U.S. government passed in the wake of a flurry of indiscretions by the U.S. intelligence community in the 60s and 70s. The amendments, among other things, granted telecommunications companies which had cooperated with the government's surveillance program retroactive immunity from legal damages. Given this legal change, the EFF's case was dismissed by a federal appeals court.

Within hours of the passage of the FISA Amendments Act, challenging it's constitutionality. The case was dismissed in district court over standing, but affirmed in appeals court. In the aforementioned decision handed down today, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they could not prove they themselves had been subject to the allegedly illegal surveillance program.

The consensus over the proper legal protocol to assess standing in these surveillance cases is far from broad, courts impose on surveillance plaintiffs a stricter test for probabilistic injuries than exists in the rest of standing law.""

Questions:

1. In light of this trend of dismissal

2. What middle ground can be found between correctly assessing standing and allowing important legal questions of the state's surveillance ability to go through?


3. Do these dismissals constitute a tacit go-ahead on the part of the courts to the government to use surveillance methods the usage of which is impossible to prove?",,t5_2tk0i,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/19a18b/if_it_is_functionally_impossible_to_legally_cite/

* Only moderators may create META posts. Although we appreciate the desire of the community to improve /r/NeutralPolitics
* The mods strongly encourage reporting. It's the best tool we have to keep conversations in line, since they're unfamiliar with how things work around here. And don't worry... reporting is completely anonymous; nobody knows who reported a comment.
* When posting
* Our user base is international,"" and even ""right wing"" mean different things, or mean nothing, in other parts of the world. When using such terms, either define them or specify USA.
* *What to do if your post gets removed.* Mods will always message OPs stating the reason(s) for removing a post. But that's not the end of the story. If the topic is appropriate for r/NeutralPolitics, we're happy to provide that too. Sadly, most submitters never take advantage of these opportunities and their posts just die.

The default should be that people pay no taxes, and the burden should be on those arguing for a type of spending to demonstrate that that spending is worth the associated tax.

I like the idea of state legislatures having a more prominent role again and I vehemently think that the process could be a check on a more radical Senator that may be voted in by 1% or 2%.

Just today, we're going to have to deal with the individuals who perpetrate them, not the tools they use to wreak their havoc.

The question is

I've heard people argue that a lot of these incidents come down to a mental health problem, Israel and Spain were commonplace for decades, but they seem to have been largely resolved. How did those countries deal with the problem?

My reasoning is basically this:

1. If I have a serious health problem (hit by a car, way too expensive for me (or most people) to pay for treatment out-of-pocket.

2. Since I have this risk of suddenly being exposed to a large cost that I can't avoid

3. It's not reasonable for a company to insure me on my own unless the premiums are really high

4. But that's fine since insurance companies work by insuring a bunch of people and pooling risk. As more people get pooled together

5. The problem for the insurers is that people know how healthy they are -- so someone who eats right and exercises is less likely to get insurance than someone with a family history of heart disease. Which means that people buying into the insurance are riskier than the general population.

6. That sort of wipes out the ideal insurance market from step 4 -- if the pools are especially attractive to high-risk individuals, which increases the aggregate risk, and so on.

7. The only way that you can really prevent this is to mandate participation in the health insurance market. That way everyone is insured and the premiums aren't too high.

Ignoring the corporate tax removal lets look at the state income tax. On top of the sales tax you purchase for sales of items (excluding some certain products such as groceries) you pay a percentage of your income to the state on top of federal income taxes. There is no choice of whether to pay for this or not because its forced. Automatically a percentage of your income is gone to the state. So removing the state income tax will keep that percentage of money in the pockets of the taxpayer. 

The left argue that the sales tax always hurts the poor but lets look at basic across the board sales tax. A sales' tax of 5% is the same for whether you buy a 20 dollar meal ($1) compared to buying a $100

I was poking around similar subreddits and I found [an interesting article about Niccolo Machiavelli](http://www.historytoday.com/blog/2013/02/machiavelli-not-so-machiavellian). Earlier this year the arrest warrant for Machiavelli was rediscovered in Florence's archives

What it helps illustrate is that our view of Machiavelli may be greatly distorted. His arrest and torture was right before he wrote *The Prince*- a work he dedicates to those that punished him after the fall of the Florentine republic. Looking at his psychology, we ignore his later work that favors republicanism over savvy monarchy. Thus using the word ""Machiavellian"" could be a disservice to his life and ideology.

I use this example because part of neutral politics is looking at, or overemphasized, or ignored all together. In modern American classrooms, Thomas Paine is a key part of all history textbooks- but until the 20th century he was reviled as a anti-religion radical, and all but forgotten by the time he died. Paine's work remains the same, but how he would be referenced has shifted.

I think it is fair to assume that the average pro-gun individual doesn't want to pass a law banning any type of gun currently legal. I believe it is also fair to assume the average anti-gun individual doesn't want to start arming guards in elementary schools and malls to protect against tragedies like what happened at Sandy Hook.

Now for the strange similarity in my opinion. For this thought experiment one must put there emotional feelings about the subject aside and answer the questions strictly as they are asked

Imagine if there had been an armed guard in Sandy Hook. One that was trained to protect against this type of tragedy. Would this tragedy have happened? If the shooting still happened, is undeniably no to at least one of those questions. Had there been an armed guard prepared to prevent a shooting this deadly, I find it hard to believe it still would have happened to the degree that it did. Now, if you point out this fact to a anti-gun individual how do they react? More than likely they are completely against this solution. But why? If they actually thought about it, wouldn't they have to agree that an armed guard could prevent or at least lessen tragedies like this from happening? The reason they disagree with this solution, is simply based on principle. They know that this solution could be effective in countering this problem, but they instantly disagree with it simply based on principle. They do not want to spread the use of guns

But what does this same anti-gun crowd say about pro-gun individuals? They likely despise them because of their principled belief that government shouldn't have the power to take their guns away even though it could help protect against tragedies like this.

In my opinion you have two sides hating the opposing side because of their principled belief. Even though both sides have a reasonable argument in a possible way to counter these tragedies.

tl;dr would armed guards in places like sandy hook prevent or lessen the tragedy? if yes

Both the Congressional Budget Office and economists and [journalists](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/fact-checking-the-ryan-budget-plan/2011/04/05/AFIaZpnC_blog.html) were highly skeptical of the math and reasoning behind its claims.

He is seen as the man responsible for bringing stability to a chaotic nation and rapidly developing its economy

What's most interesting to me is the generational gap in perceptions of Park. The older generation seems to support him

The idea that a country could ""need"" a dictator, but examples abound of countries caught in vicious cycles of political chaos, violence, and economic decay that is only ended when a strongman takes power. Dictatorships tend to be oppressive, but they also tend to be stable. By establishing a monopoly on violence, they fulfill one of the basic responsibilities of a state. Even better if those in power manage to invest in infrastructure, education, and other basic services

Robert Kaplan is the author I am most familiar with who often argues for the idea of a ""[virtuous dictator](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/403b2920-450a-11e0-80e7-00144feab49a.html#axzz2FZWTJjSa)"". According to Kaplan, and even in the so-called ""China model"" of development. I also see parallels with Vladimir Putin, whose domestic critics, very ironically, tend to hail from the middle class he helped create after Yeltsin's mismanagement of the Russian economy.

Of course, because the dictator doesn't have to play ethnic and religious factions off against each other, thereby further dividing and weakening the country, to remain in power.

Serious question:



**At what point does liberal bias become just idiom for anything contrary to the right-wing ideology of the moment?**



Everyone's bias. But, conservative, libertarian, etc. As I believe it isn't necessary, and actually under serving to critical thought. I do however, have consensus with many liberal/progressive views. However, my expressions rise from my own personal judicial review of facts and not the liberality of the viewpoint.
So the question arises from a /r/neuralpolitics discussion about where people get their news from. I saw a good amount of comments suggesting that NPR, given, liberal.

I believe that biases based on reporting document-able evidence shouldn't be categorized as liberal leaning (which is what I feel like is happening in today’s partisan environment, I’ll start with my definition of liberal leaning: meaning, biased towards liberal viewpoints in an overt or covert manner.

I think ""liberal"" now has been subconsciously defined as the opposite of conservative. From what I hear of NPR they go out of their way to provide platform to (in my bias viewpoint) some of the silliest conservative, even if there is irrefutable evidence that they are inaccurate. They then usually point out the contested views in their reporting and leave it for the listener's judgment. Which(in my opinion) is actually +1 for the silly non fact based talking point, which subtracted time from an actually credible, fact based debate on both sides.
In science you keep ""law"" and ""theory"" separate at all times. A theory attempts to explain the phenomenon of law

While I adamantly agree there is absolutely such a thing as ""liberal bias"". It is itself blatantly so, I do not define as ""liberal"".
To digress
I think the goal of neutral politics, because it's not liberal. Because, to be honest they're just two words and imaginary ideologies that have not conscious power over data and evidence.

**TL; DR: Stepping outside the conservative bubble isn't synonymous with liberal bias. Bipartisanship isn't synonymous with ideal solutions.**

**Is this a subreddit for people who are politically neutral?**

No - in fact we welcome and encourage any viewpoint to engage in discussion. The idea behind r/NeutralPolitics is to set up a neutral space where those of differing opinions can come together and rationally lay our respective arguments. We are neutral in that no political opinion is favored here - only facts and logic. Your post or comment will be judged not by its perspective, and informational content.

At this subreddit, but sometimes it is best to part ways with a respectful “Good day, sir”. The choice lies in your good judgment.

Finally

-----

**So you’re personally not politically neutral? Well…can I still make Futurama jokes?**

I have no strong feelings one way or the other.

-----

**Are world events allowed

Our subreddit has a global scope, that if not many other redditors are located in the region that you are posting about, we won’t necessarily understand your topic. If that’s the case, make sure to post informative links so that we could all get a chance to learn more and then discuss it. Also, please indicate in the title what region or nation-state you are talking about to clarify your discussion and avoid misunderstanding.

Related note: in the comments

-----

**I want to post a news article that I saw on a larger subreddit. Is that okay?**

Conversations on the larger political subreddits can often be disappointing, and that means that we need more than just discussion - we need current events, too. Just remember two things: use a different source for the story if the linked content is heavily biased or overly emotional and avoid copying the post title unless you have verified that it meets our standards.

-----

**There sure is a lot of weight placed on evidence and information here. Why is that?**

When discussing practical political issues, and we walk away from the former not angry, but with a better understanding of the world around us. **The goal here isn’t to prove that you are right.** It is to find out if you are right. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t defend your position, but it does mean that you should acknowledge when you have been presented with enough logical evidence to bring that position into question.

-----

**What kind of evidence should I use?**

The best sources of information would be peer-reviewed, make sure that it is publicly accessible - many cannot be viewed off of a college campus without a subscription). Periodicals and news articles are also fine, but make sure to read multiple sources in order to check for information that might be left out. We will delete anything referencing Wikipedia, so if you found something there, check Wikipedia's references rather than linking directly. It's one extra step, but that's not very difficult and helps to build the strength of your claim. Also, remember that other users may question and critique your evidence. This isn't a bad thing

-----

**I want to have a discussion

We prefer discussions where claims can be backed by evidence, and that replies that contain relevant evidence deserve upvotes, so it is always best to research as much as you can first. If you can’t find any information, make it clear that you searched and ask if anyone can help you find some. Do your best to explain the reasoning that lead you to your current belief (because without evidence, it *is* a belief). Though this is stepping foot into the philosophical realm, at the core of politics is philosophy, so utilize reason and logic as best you can. The mods, will watch closely to make sure that these discussions are being carried out in a constructive way.These conversations can still be beneficial and intelligent (such as [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/pquui/utilitarianism_libertarianism_or_egalitarianism/))

On that note, and other topics that may stray completely outside of the realm of hard evidence are welcome. All we ask is that you support your positions with defensible logic and be open and transparent with that logic. A discussion on morality that is simply, “Well I believe X” is not productive, constructive, or worthwhile. Such discussions will be deleted. Try your best to explain why you believe what you do. As debates on morality can be particularly personal, **it is important to remember not to downvote someone simply because you disagree with their opinion**.  Remember to practice good reasoning. Avoid logical fallacies, and be open minded to other views.

-----

**Am I going to get looked down upon if I ‘lose’ a debate?**

Admitting that you are wrong does not mean that you have failed - it means that you have successfully put your ego aside and adapted to new information in a way that few are able to. None of us can know everything, but rather with the intention of informing themselves and their conversation partner.

Remember: **your opinions are not a part of your identity**. They are conclusions drawn from experience and evidence, the dumber they make you.""

An idea that has been raised in some quarters (especially in light of rising inequality) is basing affirmative action on economic status rather than race see (see the articles I have linked to). Thus instead of universities reserving places for certain minorities they would do so for the economically disadvantaged regardless of colour or gender.

The proposal I am presenting is one of mixed sortition. That is, while worthwhile to debate, are offered simply to frame the discussion for the larger questions on hand. These details are the following:  

 
* The pool of candidates is selected from those who currently or previously had state licenses or identifications and from voter registration (no duplication so all individuals have equal probability)
* The number of sortition selected representatives is 200 in the House and 100 in the Senate (exact number not important). 
* The selected House seats are to be distributed according to state population.
* The selected Senate seats are each allocated to one state regardless of population. 
* The requirements for the respective houses remain the same (age,000 salary plus benefits).  

 
So far I've left out the most important question of all: ""Why?""  

 
An oft-quoted sentiment is that those who want to (or able to) get elected are seldom the type of people who should be in power. The barrier to elected office is a high and costly one.

Though elections are certainly preferable to an absolute monarchy there is much left to be desired from our current democracy. A democracy hopes that politicians

 
The benefits of mixed sortition are numerous. First of all, sortition representatives do not belong to the political machine; they owe no favors to interest groups or party leadership. This allows them to more objectively view issues. Furthermore, not all their decisions are political because they need not think of reelection.  

 
Concerns:
Is the pool of candidates sufficiently wide or too wide? Under no circumstances did I want to submit candidates to qualification test of any sort. In addition

Are there any instances of implementation?,hotboxpizza,28,7,4,"I read about [global licensing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DADVSI#The_.22global_license.22) in the Wikipedia article on DADVSI in France. It seems like a relatively logical idea but its never even brought up in the mainstream copyright debate.

The basic idea is that Internet users would be entirely freed from any restriction on media downloading, and sharing, for a meager fee paid to their ISP every month (it was proposed as €7/mo on Internet plans that cost €30 on average in France). The ISP would turn around and give that money to the govt. (or potentially some independent commission/organization) who would redistribute the money to those artists. 

As far as I can tell

**PROS**

- It would allow for greater bet compensation of artists and lower prices of entertainment for consumers.

- It would even further decrease dependence of artists on record labels for distribution. (*I'll come back to this*)

- It's more realistic that Internet users would follow this

- Replaces the clunky and obtrusive DRM system as we have it.

**CONS**

- Difficult to track which artists deserve to be paid more and which deserve to be paid less. Simple polling would likely ignore the smaller artists. (*I'll come back to this too*)

- *Might* fail to adequately repay artists.

- It's communist and DRM allows for adequate individual apportionment of proceeds. 

-Contrary to the 'Test in Three Steps'

My thoughts go a few ways here:

First, it's probably not useful, at least as a primary argument, to worry about political viability.

Second, so a system like this likely wouldn't hurt them terribly, while it would massively help out smaller artists.

He argued that people vote based on intuition rather than reason based on differences in several foundational concepts such as harm/care, purity/sanctity.  

I'm curious as to what neutralpolitickers think of this view and what other research exists that seeks to explain political leanings on the basis of fundamental beliefs common to all humans.  The common idea that conservatives are continually duped to vote against their own interests seems dubious.  His assertions make sense given that research has shown that people tend to make decisions based on emotions (the 'gut' feeling) and then justify these decisions with cherry-picked facts later.

To my eye, denies them the right to vote in the US and deports those that do come. Those deported are sent back to an area where they have lower quality health care, schools, employment opportunities, et cetera. We have segregation in that we force one group to live in a completely different country.

Many of the justifications for these restrictions are also similar. If US law didn't discriminate against Mexican nationals, and probably decrease wages for low-skill American workers.

SCOTUS did not say the ACA fit in the commerce clause

The assenting opinion by the four more liberal judges said that it did

Summary of some important bits:

**From majority opinion (Roberts)**

&gt; Congress already possesses expansive power to regulate what people do. Upholding the Affordable Care Act under the Commerce Clause would give Congress the same license to regulate what people do not do. The Framers knew the difference between doing something and doing nothing. They gave Congress the power to regulate commerce
 
...

&gt; Nor can the individual mandate be sustained under the Necessary and Proper Clause as an integral part of the Affordable Care Act’s other reforms.

...

&gt; The most straightforward reading of the individual mandate is that it commands individuals to purchase insurance. But, §8, cl. 1. In pressing its taxing power argument, the Government asks the Court to view the mandate as imposing a tax on those who do not buy that product. Because “every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality,” Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648, the question is whether it is “fairly possible” to interpret the mandate as imposing such a tax
4. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part III–C

...

&gt; The Affordable Care Act’s requirement that certain individuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax. Because the Constitution permits such a tax

**From the Ginsburg opinion:**

&gt; The provision of health care is today a concern of na­ tional dimension, eventually, to their survivors. Beyond question, Congress could have adopted a similar scheme for health care. Congress chose, instead, to preserve a central role for private insurers and state governments. According to THE CHIEF JUSTICE, the Commerce Clause does not permit that preservation. This rigid reading of the Clause makes scant sense and is stunningly retrogressive.

&gt; For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit should be reversed. In my view, the provision encounters no constitutional obstruction. Further, I would uphold the Eleventh Circuit’s decision that the Medicaid expansion is within Congress’ spending power.

**From the dissent (Kennedy):**

&gt; A few respectful responses to JUSTICE GINSBURG’s dis- sent on the issue of the Mandate are in order. That dis- sent duly recites the test of Commerce Clause power that our opinions have applied, at 15 (emphasis added). But it must be activity affecting commerce that is regulated, and not merely the failure to engage in commerce. And one is not now purchasing the health care covered by the insurance mandate simply because one is likely to be purchasing it in the future. Our test’s premise of regulated activity is not invented out of whole cloth, but rests upon the Constitution’s requirement that it be commerce which is regulated. If all inactivity affecting commerce is commerce, commerce is everything.

...

&gt; The Court today decides to save a statute Congress did
not write. It rules that what the statute declares to be a requirement with a penalty is instead an option subject to a tax. And it changes the intentionally coercive sanc- tion of a total cut-off of Medicaid funds to a supposedly noncoercive cut-off of only the incremental funds that the Act makes available.
The Court regards its strained statutory interpretation as judicial modesty. It is not. It amounts instead to a vast judicial overreaching. It creates a debilitated, provisions that certain interests favored under the Court’s new design will struggle to retain. And it leaves the public and the States to expend vast sums of money on requirements that may or may not survive the necessary congressional revision.

and closing

&gt; The Constitution, the restraints imposed by federalism and separation of powers—are less romantic and have less obvious a connection to personal freedom than the provisions of the Bill of Rights or the Civil War Amendments. Hence they tend to be undervalued or even forgotten by our citizens. It should be the responsibility of the Court to teach otherwise, to remind our people that the Framers considered structural protections of freedom the most important ones, for which reason they alone were embodied in the original Constitution and not left to later amendment. The fragmentation of power produced by the structure of our Government is central to liberty, and when we destroy it, we place liberty at peril. Today’s decision should have vindicated, should have taught, our judgment today has disregarded it.
For the reasons here stated

Information is extraordinarily difficult to find.

I know that anyone who already has health insurance ([~84.3% of the population](http://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p60-238.pdf)) will not have to worry about it - as they already have health coverage. I also know that the poor (less than the Federal Poverty Level) will have coverage (through Medicare), to purchase health insurance on the exchanges.

What I want to know is how much the *penalty* will actually cost someone who (for whatever reason) **doesn't have** health insurance (either through Medicare, or individual market).

What follows is my attempts to try to start to solve the question. It is incomplete

i originally asked [this question on another site](http://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/1682/how-much-will-the-obamacare-tax-penalty-cost), most people will be unaffected by the penalty, some won't. I'm hoping /r/NeutralPolitics can answer the question (and without prejudice).

---------------------

The first note is that the *""flat fee""* will ramp up over the next three years ([1][1]

- $95 for calendar year 2014 
- $325 in 2015
- $695 in 2016
- indexed to the federal poverty level after that

Ignoring the gradual ramp-up over the next two years (for simplicity sake)

    Income  Cost
    ======  ====
    (all)   $695

Next we note that there is on exemption for people whose income is so low that they do not have to file a tax return.([3][3]) That *filing threshold*, if your *taxable* income (income after deductions) is zero, you do not have to pay the penalty. With this information we update the chart:

    Income            Cost
    ================  ====
    0 - $10000           0  ($3900 personal exemption + $6100 standard deduction = $10000)
    $10000 and over   $695

Next is the note that the tax is actually 2.5% of your *taxable* income

    Income            Taxable Income    Cost
    ================  ==============    ====
    0 - $10000        0                    0  $3900 personal exemption + $6100 standard deduction = $10000
    $10000 - $37800   0 - $27800        $695  $695 is larger than 2.5% of taxable income
    $37800 and over   $27800 and over   2.5%  Over $37800

Next is the note that anyone making less than 133% of the **Federal Poverty Level** (FPL) ([5](http://obamacarefacts.com/obamacare-tax-penalty.php)) is exempt. Medicare coverage will also be extended to anyone making less than 133% of the FPL. This means that you *have* health care coverage

    Income            Taxable Income    Cost
    ================  ==============    ====
    0 - $10000        0                    0  $3900 personal exemption + $6100 standard deduction = $10000
    $10000 - 14856    0 - $4856            0  Health insurance coverage through Medicare
    $14856 - $37800   $4856 - $27800    $695  $695 is larger than 2.5% of taxable income
    $37800 and over   $27800 and over   2.5%  Over $37800

 Now we have the note that the fee can't be over 8% of your income; otherwise you are exempt ([6](http://obamacarefacts.com/obamacare-taxes.php)). i assume they mean 8% of *taxable* income:
 
    Income              Taxable Income    Cost
    ==================  ================    ====
    0 - $10000          0                    0  $3900 personal exemption + $6100 standard deduction = $10000; exempt
    $10000 - 14856      0 - $4856            0  Health insurance coverage through Medicare; exempt

At some point i realize that 2.5% of your income would exceed the cost of the **Broze** plan on an exchange; and it would be cheaper to actually *buy* insurance. That is the next question: what is the **""Bronze""** plan cost

Also

Bonus Chatter
----------------

A **""Bronze""** plan defines the minimum coverage that a health insurance plan must cost:


- Ambulatory patient services
- Emergency services
- Hospitalization
- Maternity and newborn care
- Mental health and substance use disorder services
- Prescription drugs
- Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices
- Laboratory services
- Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management
- Pediatric services

For people making up to 400% of the Federal Poverty Level ($44, the highest cost of a plan is $4,244 (cheaper than what you would currently pay for health care). People making less than 400% FPL get increased subsidizes.

A universal background check would solve the same safety issues as a national registry, potential unintended consequences, and could be almost entirely automated, thereby decreasing administrative costs. 

What (my idea of) a universal background check looks like: 

Regardless of where you live and whether it's P2P or a gun-shop, you now have a ""background profile,"" or whatever you want to call it. This profile only means that you applied for a profile. You did not necessarily buy the gun. That part is important. 

Now, Cabelas pings the system either upon checkout, or when you enter the ""ping-worthy items"" section. The ping doesn't say what you are looking to buy, and is anonymous for the vendor doing the pinging. If your ping comes back clean, you can buy the gun, and the government is none the wiser. If the ping doesn't come back clean, the vendor doesn't know why

The profiles could update automatically. The establishment of this database would coincide with policy changes in prosecutor's offices across the country, and you will no longer ping clean. The same could go for mental health professionals, though I haven't yet thought out the details on who specifically in that area would be able to send update packets.

If you look at the map by province, it steadily gets worse the further east you travel.

I'm sure this could be attributed to many things, and Newfoundland being more rural provinces, where most jobs are more closely related to fishing, farming, or mining (such is the case in New Brunswick and PEI, anyways). But even then, Saskatchewan and Manitoba are largely agricultural provinces, I could go on and on about how the main job sources of each province may attract a certain type of person

Firstly, as many already do to avoid giving the federal government an interest free loan, and won't be assessed the penalty as a result.

A number of states have passed

&gt; No resident of this state, shall be required to obtain or maintain a policy of individual insurance coverage except as required by a court or the department of health and human services where an individual is named a party in a judicial or administrative proceeding. No provision of this title shall render a resident of this state liable for any penalty, assessment, fee, or fine as a result of his or her failure to procure or obtain health insurance coverage. This section shall not apply to individuals voluntarily applying for coverage under a state-administered program pursuant to Title XIX or Title XXI of the Social Security Act. This section shall not apply to students being required by an institution of higher education to obtain and maintain health insurance as a condition of enrollment. Nothing in this section shall impair the rights of persons to privately contract for health insurance for family members or former family members.

Many states have also rejected &amp; returned the federal funds supplied for setting up the healthcare exchanges. While the federal government purport to be able to operate them on behalf of residents in states that don't set up exchanges states can require insurers in their states not to participate. As insurers are primarily regulated at the state level

Another part of the decision, and others are in the process of passing legislation to join. 

The Healthcare Compact seeks to nullify all current federal healthcare programs within member states (certainly in the case of Medicare

Even if the states don't manage to nullify all of ACA the expansion of Medicaid is already dead. Even if they don't manage to nullify the individual mandate the enforcement is toothless and people are already being advised how to avoid incurring it entirely. In short the only provision of ACA that seems to be remaining intact is the pre-existing condition requirement for insurers

Where do you see ACA in 5 years?

We are human and there are IMO always irreducably irrational motives and drives for our behavior. F.x an atheist libertarian may have put a lot of thought into his/her argument but can he give a comprehensive account for the meaning of life and solve the is-ought problem from his/her standpoint.
I like the idea of this subreddit as a mediator between opposing sides in a debate so the concept of neutrality to me really means: Balance. I welcome your thoughts on the matter.


2. So, lsd, speed, cocaine and heroin. 
The key word here is 'potentially. It feels to me as if the debate on the legal status of drugs has been watered down and spoon-fed to regular
Cocaine can cause death in large doses and those LARGE doses are even more dangerous to people with heart problems. In LARGE doses(1/20th of a lethal dose produces the desired effects) heroin kills and people die from it generally because they don't know what they're doing. They go all-in
 And that's why they die. That's why moonshine is more dangerous than red wine.
 So
There is hardly any public or widely acknowledged support for this. Even the needle-exchange programs in the most devastated neighbourhoods make a positive difference

Most of the people who die from hard drug use die for no reason but society's apathy and denial towards the fact that sometimes people choose between our fucked up society and the junkie-den...and choose the latter.

 Alot of people are constantly getting worked up about the approval of marijuana legalization crawling over a 50 percent rating but ignore the plight of serious addicts maybe thinking it will all go away and saving stoners out of county prisons is more important than saving unfortunate souls from their deaths on the streets. 
Sorry for the harsh words but i think a lot of marijuana advocates should take a look in the mirror and actually practice the open-mindedness and liberalism they preach. After all
/I would like to stress the importance of the first two articles to see where i'm coming from. We don't have people dropping like flies from paracetamol and this makes the current situation with heroin nothing more than a medieval absurdity.

Personally I'm no fan of Strassel nor do I necessarily agree with this piece

It makes sense, and much of the action Obama has taken ""unilaterally"" have not been life-or-death measures. Unilateral action to save a crumbling economy is one thing, but cap-and-trade via the EPA and the DREAM Act didn't have to be rushed.

**TL;DR** Obama is making exceptional use of executive privilege and general executive power.

Text:

&gt;The ObamaCare litigation is history

&gt;Where, yes. The ""imperial presidency"" of George W. Bush was a favorite judgment of the left about our 43rd president's conduct in war, wiretapping and detentions. Yet say this about Mr. Bush: His aggressive reading of executive authority was limited to the area where presidents are at their core power—the commander-in-chief function.

&gt;By contrast,"" Matthew Spalding recently wrote on the Heritage Foundation blog, is ""disregard for the powers of the legislative branch in favor of administrative decision making without—and often in spite of—congressional action.""

&gt;Put another way: Mr. Obama proposes

&gt;For example, yet there is no reading of ""prosecutorial discretion"" that allows for blanket immunity for entire classes of offenders.

&gt;Mr. Obama disagrees with federal law, he stops defending it in court. He dislikes provisions of the federal No Child Left Behind Act, so he asked Congress for fixes. That effort failed, so now his Education Department issues waivers that are patently inconsistent with the statute.

&gt;Similarly, including Democrats, wouldn't pass his cap-and-trade legislation. His Environmental Protection Agency is now instituting it via a broad reading of the Clean Air Act. Congress, again including members of his own party, wouldn't pass his ""card-check"" legislation eliminating secret ballots in union elections. So he stacked the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) with appointees who pushed through a ""quickie"" election law to accomplish much the same. Congress wouldn't pass ""net neutrality"" Internet regulations, so Mr. Obama's Federal Communications Commission did it unilaterally.

&gt;In January, making a mockery of that chamber's advice-and-consent role. In June, he expanded the definition of ""executive privilege"" to deny House Republicans documents for their probe into the botched Fast and Furious drug-war operation, making a mockery of Congress's oversight responsibilities.

&gt;This president's imperial pretensions extend into the brute force the executive branch has exercised over the private sector. The auto bailouts turned contract law on its head

&gt;And it has been much the same in his dealings with the states. Don't like Arizona's plans to check immigration status? Sue. Don't like state efforts to clean up their voter rolls? Invoke the Voting Rights Act. Don't like state authority over fracking? Elbow in with new and imagined federal authority

There's a well-circulated assertion that ""People who do not pay taxes should not be allowed to vote"". One path of reasoning that can land here is viewing the government as a fiscal co-operative, but the assertion and its reasoning (and even the truth of this weakness) can all wiggle a bit to accommodate.

Let's alter the seminal assertion a bit. Consider ""People should have representation in government proportional to their interest"". Now, Brazil, Russia, USA, the EU), you get a common idea that floats around, at least around the time when those large vote-governed bodies are being formed: ""Constituents should have power in government proportional to their population."" It wouldn't be surprising that founders would try to define constituents of roughly equal populations; that would greatly simplify representative voting. I interpret the commonness of this idea, to be evidence that the people who found governments see value in humans

In a system of proportional democratic representation, but they can also be at odds. Take a look at a US [taxpayer breakdown](http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/MINT-TAXES-R2.png). If we use taxes to measure fiscal investment, that diagram suggests that 5% of the population has a 60% fiscal investment in the US government, and 47% of the population supports 0%. A fair-say-for-your-investment model would likely, in that case, be viewed as utterly draconian.

Were this a collection of 20 people, but I would devise a scheme to get my fair input back.

Note that in real life we end up with lobbyists and and campaign financing and healthcare laws (and healthcare reform) that all support the major players in these industries. Unsurprising. I am not interested in whether this is moral or not. I am interested in whether it is the inevitable negative feedback against a democratic system that promises inequitable returns from fiscal investment

Going off these definitions it seems a bailout is a subset of subsidies. Yet when people talk about bailouts many people find them totally objectionable although no one is that bothered by the billions in subsidies the US spends yearly.

1365826976.0,1c94qj,Does we need a better way to hold politicians accountable for promises they make on the campaign trail?,crayons932,26,14,24,"I am starting specifically with Barack Obama and all that he has and has not done in his years in Presidency. Politifact has outlined [119 promises](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/rulings/promise-broken/) that Barack Obama made on his campaign trail (mostly in speeches) that he has yet to follow through with in office. These promises range from Guantanamo to tax loopholes to transparency to civil rights. I understand that there is [no legal binding](http://www.rbs2.com/elecprom.pdf) holding Obama to these promises


This is an issue of significant importance. A democracy works by measuring the will of the people through voting. Without an efficient way of translating the opinions of the majority into politics, they are directly disobeying the will of the people. 


Let me give an example, he does not cut taxes. Unless John Smith works tirelessly and pulls out all the stops to pass legislation, which he doesn’t because he wants to be reelected, if he fails he has failed the people who voted for him and the democratic system. 


There are a couple arguments I would like to address before anyone jumps to disagree. First off is the excuse that an official didn’t “realize” that there would be opposition once he or she got into office. The simple answer is that there is no way for a smart politician who has made it far in politics (I am using Obama as a reference) could possibly overlook the adversarial two-party system while planning his or her future policies. If one actually believed that a politician had no idea what politics in America is then one must find him or her entirely inadequate to run our country. If a politician does not believe that he or she will be able to achieve his or her goals then they should not have made promises in the first place. 


The second argument is the “he tried his best” rebuttal. No, then the constant pressure of reelection hinders the democratic process. For example, for the first two years of his presidency Barack Obama had a majority in both the house and the senate and the American people on his side screaming for change. And what did he accomplish? Next to nothing of substance. He didn’t try his hardest because he was hesitant to follow through with the promises he made to the American people because he did not want to jeopardize his political future. 


The third and final argument is that every politician who has ever lived has lied on the campaign trail, and pardoning current politicians because of the equally unjust acts of those before them is just as absurd. 


I understand that this is a bold assertion to make, what are your thoughts? Do we need a way to hold politicians accountable? 


Tldnr: Politicians can say whatever they want whenever they want and get elected. The fact that they are not held accountable for what they say effectively ruins democracy.

1360862888.0,18iw1x,Are there strong arguments against infrastructure spending right now?,owleabf,15,3,21,"I've read a number of wonky-ish articles basically arguing that infrastructure spending is more or less a no-brainer right now. The rough argument goes like this:


1) US infrastructure is in bad shape relative to other 1st-world countries

2) Money is incredibly cheap

3) Unemployment is particularly high and demand low in construction

4) Overall unemployment is a drag on our economy and a significant factor in current budgeting issues


So... Borrow cheap money to make necessary updates to infrastructure at below normal prices. In the process take a bite out of unemployment and help the economy out of its slump.

Any solid arguments against? All I can think of is that this is additional borrowing, why not when it's cheap?

1338964116.0,unkj2,(xpost from r/Politics) I suspect that political violence could go from unthinkable to on the table for some factions within the next four to five election cycles.,RainingSilently,16,4,5,"TLDR (for those who don't want to read the whole thing): IF current political trends in American politics continue as they have been THEN violence by political groups that would have never considered violence before will be an option more likely to be considered. Now for the long explanation:

**First Assumption:** Violence is generally only viewed as a viable option by a significant portion of the population whenever they feel that peaceful options with a legitimate chance of success have been exhausted. I feel that this isn't a stretch in the least. I think that is what's brilliant about the design of our country, and economic system in some fashion. The sheer number of safety valves has, in the past, prevented the eruption of most forms of serious political violence barring events like the civil war, which was sparked by a question that had no real established means of resolution within the system.

**Second Assumption:** Mainstream political groups are largely disconnected from at least a plurality of the American population. I don't feel that this is that much of a stretch either: if at least 40% of the population doesn't care for either party or only affiliates with one of the two major parties simply due to lack of better options and has serious reservations about it

**Third Assumption:** Mainstream politics have been growing more polarized, and the people running the show are more extreme in their views than others have been. With PACs running smear campaigns and the politics of the Wars on Terror and certain social issues still unresolved, things aren't likely to get any less polarized anytime soon.

**Fourth Assumption:** Today sees unprecedented manipulation and monopolization of the available political resources in our system by the major establishments. I personally feel that voter fraud, corporate and church involvement, PACs, and coordination via social media have all seen an upward surge in recent years, and I don't think that I am the only one. Previously while in certain elections (local, midterm etc) loose cannons and people unaffiliated with major parties had a chance, today's political setups are sophisticated to a degree to push their agendas on anyone but the other major party

**Conclusion:** These trends, political violence will become a serious risk in the US if these trends are left uninterrupted.

So with that out of the way

It's clear that many if not most media sources are biased to some degree in one way or another. Many also twist their telling of the news in order to promote sensationalism to increase sales/viewers. However it's also clear the media has an immense power to manipulate and influence the way their audiences think. This is what has me worried.

As my faith in humanity shrank I began to think that the general population is far more susceptible to manipulation than most would like to think. And having such a power

Now of course on the contrary having the media under direct state control can be just as if not more disastrous.

So what I want to discuss is whether the current American/Western media model is right

1. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) commonly strike across borders, that the US has illegally expanded its counterterrorism operations (read: war) into sovereign nations.

Rebuttal: This is not an issue with UAVs in and of themselves

2. ""Drones"" reduce one side's human costs associated with war. This brings a moral hazard

Rebuttal: The same is true of every military technology ever. Archery can reduce one side's human costs associated with infantry warfare; so can body armor, simply a necessary evolution according to the escalating nature of military technology.

3. Drones de-humanize both sides. UAV pilots may not feel an adequate moral reservation about attacking targets

Rebuttal: This begs many questions: what is an adequate level of moral reservation, to the extent that UAVs are a non-issue.

4. Domestically-operated drones may legitimize more domestic attacks. Drones are so well protected in the theater of war that the only effective counter-attack may target the drone command centers or supply chains.

Rebuttal: Domestic attacks have long preceded ""drone warfare

5. Most nations require the consent of the people, not a legislature. Therefore drones are further removed from democratic oversight.

Politicians can and do give unions concessions without paying for them. Politicians suffer greatly from a strike or the loss of support from a powerful voting bloc, and generous pension and health benefits. The costs of these measures have a large impact on tax payers and the budgets of future politicians, but little impact on the politician that agrees to the contract. Private sector managers have stronger motivations to keep current and future profits high.
