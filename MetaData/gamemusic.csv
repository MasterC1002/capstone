My definition for Legal: 
1) Posted by Music Artist or at least linked to by the music creator 
2) preferably on reputable site such as IGN or Dev Website 
3) Original Music (some fan remakes are allowed (fan game soundtracks count as original). 

Hope this helps you with your suggestions.

I arranged them all to play seamlessly so they complement each other. You'll hear that the music will go through ""arcs""

My playlists together have dozens of hours worth of music. So if you have all the time and interest, and ""holy shit"" playlists.

If you don't want to listen to it all

Couple of advice:

1. I don't listen to video game music that tries not to sound like video game music. So if you were expecting the kind you'd hear from very popular western games and the like you're in bad luck.

2. Not all of these are video game music. But fun fact: The OST of  the anime feature film The Ideon: Be Invoked was composed by the composer of the Dragon Quest series.

3. A lot of the music varies from 8-bit to fully orchestrated, and I think it'd be good to vary those to contrast each other so they can stand out.

Still to this very day
These playlists total about 1

I tried to organize them a bit for convenience purposes (personal and for sharing):

Mario/Zelda music: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxoHRtdUNvaGh9udju0vbnlusdBTsCxMg

Chrono Series/Xenogears music: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxoHRtdUNvaFfDSpO3JhY0zlZX1CuxP41

Fire Emblem music: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxoHRtdUNvaF3CWORI-8n4fx0DLOwV0We

My three other playlists are from several different series (other from those above) that I ''loosely'' divided by mood (some can't be really clearly classified as it can be very subjective to each person):

''Intense'' music (gets me hyped): http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxoHRtdUNvaGY99LnjwreKlDGwmzuLc1w

''Upbeat'' music (catchy tracks that might make you bob your head): http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxoHRtdUNvaGbAZKx9jd97260T6u4GSW7

''Relaxing'' music (soothing

My extra playlist where I keep adding music I like to organize it eventually: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxoHRtdUNvaEpdaS62cOQPUtX4cJNqh_u&amp;feature=edit_ok

This album is the oldschool-inspired Official Soundtrack for a game that doesn't exist: Neptune. Neptune must traverse several treacherous environments and defeat the evil Dr. Musician to save the citizens of The City and his kidnapped love. 

This collection is distributed on a pay-what-you-want basis. I offer the music for free. I ask only that you pay what you think it is worth and/or what you can afford. If you like it

When I say ""creepy"" I more so mean ominous. A song that doesn't necessarily imply creepiness but is more so alluding to danger that is coming ahead. The more simple and ambient the better. 

A perfect example of what I'm looking for is [Confusing Melody](http://youtu.be/b0XA-akYQtQ) from Chrono Trigger. For how simple it is it really installs a sense of looming danger. The [Forest Temple Theme](http://youtu.be/JpFC06BrIhI) from Ocarina of Time is another good example. I'd like to find similar tracks to this,False,,t5_2rmsp,False,,swordkirby,t3_1hy73r
