What I myself have to say about this series is the following: Transmetropolitan is somehow filthy and classy. It is the worst curse words and insults you'll ever hear as well as some of the most touching writing you will read in a graphic novel. Transmet is about the truth and the simple fact that truth can be just as beautiful as it can be ugly. I hope some you read it and find it as enjoyable as I did.

&gt;Teaching Watchmen will allow me to engage my students through the growing, my students will be able to link it to such classic studies of the hero archetype as Beowulf, Oedipus, and Hamlet, while also analyzing its connections with dystopian literature such as 1984.

&gt;It is obvious that students live in an increasingly visual culture. Engaging them in the reading of Watchmen will allow them to tap into the the arterial immediacy of the present and the intellectual heritage of the past.

Which types of leadership do graphic novels teach most predominantly? Does this differ between eastern and western graphic novels?
 
Do eastern and western graphic novels present protagonists differently? How are the protagonists related to eastern western culture and education?
 
Is there a homogeneity of leadership presented in eastern and western graphic novels?

My name is Marcus Ako.  I am a Writer/Director/Producer/Actor.  I started off as an Actor based in the UK, Lennie James, Colin Salmon etc).  But having a wife and 2 kids tends to keep you rooted, so I started writing, producing, and directing my own material, which has fulfilled me in many more ways than if I had stuck to acting. I have done a number of short films, I dove into another passion of mine: Graphic novels.  I found it was an excellent way of getting all the twisted

Culliver City is a crime noir graphic novel in a similar vein to Criminal by Ed Brubaker or Sin City by Frank Miller. In each volume / story arc in the series, a three-issue immersion into the hit-man marketplace in Culliver City.  It follows Jake Alexander, a charming younger bartender who has an affair with an old gangster's trophy wife, which causes a chain reaction that leads to 5 of the deadliest Hitmen in the city stumbling over each other to retrieve his head in 48 hours.

I haven't got around to the actual drawing of the comic... Since I obviously need a story to draw about... Otherwise I'd be drawing for no reason and making up the story as I go.

So here's my idea: 

**Batman Plot Idea**

Two homeless men are seen standing around a burning trash can in an alleyway. They're talking about the Batman, and legends about him. (Sort of similar to the stories in ""Have I Got a Story for You"" in the Gotham Knight series.)

Suddenly

Story cuts to batman inside batmobile talking to Alfred. Alfred informs about an increasingly infamous gang lord. (Later it turns out this drug lord is Black Mask). Every other panel shows batmobile going from an alleyway into a subway

Next page shows a small child on the train tracks in an abandoned underground subway. Panels will switch from each side of the boys face. One side will show a distant light in the background. The other side will show the boys face brighten up increasingly [in terms of lighting]. 

I will show the batmobile stop right as its about the child. batman gets out of the batmobile. Batman tells the boy to get out. 

Next frame will show several pairs of red eyes emerging from the darkness [signature of Black Mask].

Batman squints his eyes

(tl;dr - namedropping

I don't seem to be able to find new graphic novels to read which would hit my nerve and I wonder if you could you recommend something fitting the description. 

I love everything by Enki Bilal for both writing and the astonishing paintings, architectural style of Möbius and recently I've been enjoy the scifi-epics of Incal by Jorodowsky. If you know these, could you recommend anything that would fit the continuum? 

It is a delight when the novels have more text than less and the quality of art aims to be top-notch. While I've never fancied superheroes

Basically what I'm after are twofold, societies and oddities not going only for grotesque.  

Or/and massive, epic scale of Nausicaa of the Valley of the wind, mature scifi of Halo Jones or historical esseyness of Alix. Also, there must be more experimenting with the format like the Æon Flux: The Herodotus File, but I haven't found a single other novel that would have tried anything similar. 

That was namedropping, cartoony, superheroy (Gaimans Eterenals), cliche-manga (first psicyber-godteen was interesting, 5th not so much) or action/violence oriented (sincity, hard-boiled - while stunning, the stories are just machismo).

This weekend (Saturday 22nd - Sunday 23rd September)

Northants International Comics Expo: http://www.northantsinternationalcomicsexpo.com/index.php will be hosted at Wicksteed Park http://www.wicksteedpark.co.uk/ a small

The guest list is phenomenal

In addition to the usual (i.e Signings/ sketches/ panels) which can only be accessed by those with tickets, and cosplay section which are all free to enter. This will probably be a great relief to those of us who just want to have a mosey for those key issues we are missing, or families who just want something to do with the kids on a weekend. 

All autographs from the attending guests will be FREE of charge, only to then have to fork over another £10-£20 per signature or tiny sketch! 

MORE IMPORTANTLY HOWEVER!! Alan Moore will be attending! O__O 

I'm totally gobsmacked. Mr Moore has allegedly not attended a comic convention in over 20 YEARS! On the Saturday evening he will be doing an hour long talk on how to write comic books, and would like to improve your own writing skills this is a ridiculous and potentially one-off opportunity. Access to Mr Moore's panel is gained through an interesting (and very worthy) method of donating your old graphic novels/ TPBs at the convention, which will go to the local library, a cause in which Alan takes a great interest in. These donations will be matched by Diamond (the UKs comic distributor).

I will be dragging all of my comic reading friends this weekend

Now for the human interest part: 
Jeff (who is putting this on), some banter, and even occasionally some lunch!! I know that putting on this convention has been his dream for many years, and he has done so well to get this far, however for this to be a success he needs to sell tickets and for this show to be as amazing as it can be. As such I humbly implore anyone who can make it this weekend to turn up, attend something unique that is punching above its weight, and support the under-dog for once instead of the flashy London cons which pocket all your money before you've even entered the door, and treat their guests like crap. If nothing else it will stop him from having a stress-induced heart attack.

Thank you for reading

- Lorna :)

In a bid to [continue to raise public awareness](http://www.rickveitch.com/2012/02/27/the-abraxas-groundswell-continues/) of this amazing work, in the flesh, so to speak, so I encourage you to [head to his site and buy a copy](http://www.rickveitch.com/the-king-hell-bookstore/). 

""*This first collected edition of the seminal graphic novel published in serial form during the early 1980s brings a powerful psychedelic journey into print. Veitch (The Maximortal; Can’t Get No) astounds with a heartfelt tale that is equal parts Herman Melville, who is shanghaied from a naval research mission, along with the submarine’s commanding officer. The pair is thrust into the thick of mad Captain Rotwang’s interstellar vendetta against Abraxas, a space-faring crimson leviathan who cost the captain his leg and, arguably, much of his sanity. As both earthmen are put through horrific physical alterations, Isaac discovers to his shock — and dawning fascination — that he may be the nexus between humanity and a great cosmic truth of staggering proportions. A lush and thought-proving narrative is seamlessly expressed through a script that veers between extremes of wide-eyed wonder and outright horror. The febrile illustrations disgust — Isaac loses his skin early on — without losing the essential humanity of this powerful tale.*""
