From what I can tell the anniversary website was up around 2:30 PST today.  Assuming that the week starts Monday(cause seriously who really considers Sunday the first day of the week) the site was live 62.5 hours into the week.

100% * 62.5 / (24 * 7)  gives us that that the site was released 37.2% of the way through the week. 

0.372 * 366 days this year = Diablo 3 will be released 136.16 days in to the year.

I’m Wyatt Cheng, we’re responsible for creating and iterating on the major game design elements for Diablo III, including class skills, item development, monster affixes (powers), difficulty tuning, and much more. Now that the game has launched and a lot of you have gotten a chance to play
 
Since we’re game designers and not server engineers, or PR representatives, we decided to go with an AMAA over an AMA. We want to talk about the game with you, but we realize there are a few things we can’t really speak on. We’ll still try to answer as many questions as possible during our two-hour window, but please keep in mind that we may be unable to address a lot of topics beyond gameplay.

**[UPDATE THREAD](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/u54ik/update_the_potential_arg_contained_in_diablo_3/). Comment in that one. It's far better organized.**

Whimsy shire. We all know about it. Blizzard's secret level.

Now
The music for this level is odd. Very odd.
Link to the music:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftLAol0SyGA

If you listen to it
Right. Reversing the music
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1wqpBzaltg

This is where things start to get exciting. This reversing of Whimsyshire's music results in a tune very similar to Ravel - Gaspard de la Nuit.
Link:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrHkclI98lw

**Edit 3: Here are all 3 of the songs**

**Ondine: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-LDHH8FDi0 **

**Le Gibet: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrHkclI98lw **

**Scarbo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmOYFjZxhBA **

**Hopefully this helps!**


So what does this mean? Blizzard made a reference to a song in the game. That should be the end of that
Wrong.

So I did some research.
From Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspard_de_la_nuit)
""Gaspard de la nuit is an old French expression for the Devil"" (!!!)

Moreover

The poems which the piece is based off are entitled: Scarbo

Scarbo english translation: http://english.agonia.net/index.php/poetry/164745/Scarbo

Ondine english translation: http://shadowlight9.blogspot.com/2011/04/french-poetry-iii-aloysius-bertrand.html

Le Gebit english translation: http://shadowlight9.blogspot.com/2011/04/french-poetry-iv-aloysius-bertrand-le.html

(thanks to http://www.reddit.com/user/donmanzo)

Woah! I decided to tackle ""Ondine"" first. I was going to use the poems to figure out if there was more hidden things in the game

Specifically
""lit by the gloomy rays of the moon. / And here, / I contemplate the beautiful starry night / and the ~~restless~~ sleeping lake""
Things just got interesting. A "" ~~Restless~~ *Beautiful* sleeping lake""

This image was posted awhile back:

You can make out a moon

**EDIT 1: I don't think that is a cross. I think that is the [gibbet referred to in the poem](https://www.google.com/search?q=gibbet&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;prmd=imvns&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;tbo=u&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;source=univ&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ei=zgO_T8a3A-ez6gGnn4nTCg&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ved=0CGsQsAQ&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;biw=1745&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;bih=873#q=gibbet&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;prmd=imvns&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;bav=on.2

It's very gloomy

This is as far as I have gotten on the treasure trail. I plan on continuing tomorrow by analyzing the other two poems. This is very interesting!

I also sent this to my English teacher. Maybe he could offer some insights.

To run a real-money auction house, but since your characters, the world, mob spawns and deaths, experience and loot are all generated and stored on the server, you can't cheat and create items.

There is no single player game. They never programmed one. To offer one at this point would be as much design and programming effort as creating Diablo 4. So don't expect there to ever be an offline patch for D3. When you play single player,False,self,t5_2qore,False,,,t3_toog3

**Edit** So people are claiming (with confirmed quotes from Blizzard) they took the secondary effects out of weapons. Despite this

A few examples: 

Cold damage gives you an innate slow effect and works great on DHs because they can kite a lot easier. The slow will be applied to any ability that isn't using some sort of other elemental attack (i.e. Cinder Arrow rune will change it to fire). That means, but Ball Lightning wont. Fantastic for kiting mobs.

Fire attacks have a chance of exploding an enemy on death and doing a small AoE.

Holy attacks work a lot like fire

Lightning damage has a higher chance to make an enemy flinch


It's just something I wanted to share and make sure people know. Maybe instead of grabbing that lightning enchanted weapon because it has a higher damage output

-


* **What do I do if my CE isn't arriving until after launch day?**

[Try and obtain a starter edition or guest pass.](http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/diablo-iii-starter-edition-guest-pass) 

Players on Starter Edition game licenses have the following restrictions:

* Act I up to the Skeleton King is available

* Level 13 cap

* Matchmaking available only with other Starter Edition players

* No Real Money Auction House access


Once your copy arrives



* **I played Beta

YES. Make sure that you uninstall the beta COMPLETELY.  The Retail client and Beta client are two different versions and you will be unable to login with the Beta client on release.


*  **Is it possible to buy Diablo 3 online but install from a retail copy?**

Yes

* **How can I locate Redditors to play with?**

* **Will there be a Day 1 patch?**

Yes!  According to Blizzard it will be under 100mb.
________________________________________________________________________________


**Things to do before Monday 5/14**

* **1.** Uninstall Beta if you haven't and Download the game

Doing this will allow you to patch first thing Monday morning so you can be ready to go at midnight.  This will also help Blizzards servers from being smacked all at once and could potentially effect the ability to play at midnight.  You should use the links above no matter if you plan to purchase a physical copy of the game (Standard or Collectors use the same install files) or plan to digitally purchase the game.

Please note you can download the 7.5gb game files right away but will need to wait until 5/14 in order to install the game. If you experience any trouble installing visit [this site](http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/diablo-iii-installation-troubleshooting-pc).

ONCE YOUR COPY OF THE GAME ARRIVES ATTACH THE PRODUCT KEY TO BATTLE.NET.  Doing so early will help prevent you from having troubles on launch day.



-


* **2.** Create your Battle Tag. [Click Here](https://www.battle.net/account/management/battletag-create.html) to do so.

A BattleTag is required in order to play Diablo 3.  Again do this sooner than later because the Battle.net site will most likely be experiencing issues on Monday and Tuesday.


-


* **3.** [Claim your in-game sigils!](http://reveal.diablo3.com/en_US/)

Sigils are the main artwork used on your in game banners. Blizzard is currently offering 5 limited edition to sigils on their reveal site that will not be available after 5/18.


-


* **4.** Prep your hardware!

Make sure that you have [cleared your page files](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314834)

Also make sure that you have the latest graphics drivers available from your video card manufacturer. Here's the links to [Nvidia](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) and [AMD](http://support.amd.com/us/Pages/AMDSupportHub.aspx)

* **5.** Update your /r/Diablo Flair!

[See this thread on how to do so!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/qyfqt/custom_rdiablo_battletag_flair_is_here/)


-


* **6.**  Attach an Authenticator to your account if you haven't already.


You can use the mobile authenticator for iPhone/Android


-

* **7.**  If you plan on using the Real Money Auction House or want additional security setup SMS Alerts from Blizzard.

[You can learn more here.](http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/battlenet-sms-protect)

______________________________________________________________________________

**At Launch**

 Please be aware that a delay of up to 40 seconds is possible while the game attempts to connect you. If your connection doesn’t succeed in 40 seconds


-


**Set your Global Region BEFORE attempting to Login**

As Global Play will be disabled until after the game launches in all regions, and you will not be able to connect.

To choose your correct region:

**Tips from the comments section below**

(my_nard)

In your gameplay settings:
Turn on elective mode
Turn on advanced tooltips

Normally each of your 6 skill slots are restricted to a particular category of skills. For example, and Slot1 is only for defensive skills.
Elective mode removes this limitation and allows you to assign skills from whichever category to whichever slot. You can assign a primary skill to both Mouse1 and Mouse2

It is only 50mb but people who didn't see it might be wondering why they cant install the game properly on launch night. I didnt read the whole thread so maybe someone else posted it already


(Deadstarone)

Difficulties are progressed through linearly on a character to character basis.

Leveling ranges should be roughly as follows:

Normal is levels 1-30

Nightmare is levels 30-50

Hell is levels 50-60

Inferno is for level 60 only

You will realistically only be able to reach level 60 on a character by reaching Hell difficulty.

Loot is color coded:
White for Normal items

Blue for Magic items

Yellow for Rare items

Orange for Legendary items

Green for Set items


There are 16 visual tiers of gear. I say visual because the stats on that gear will vary wildly from piece to piece. 


A Rare tier 15 piece of gear with 6 affixes is most likely better than a Magic tier 16 piece of armor in many ways.
Legendary and Set items have their own unique models for armor on top of the base 16.


Each class will look different from one another even if they wear the same tier of armor. Legendary and Set items will look the same no matter what class you wear them on (scaled for size of course).


The Official Website Game Guide is a great resource and I highly recommend anyone visit it and play around with the skill calculator and learn more about classes. All the items in the game will be listed and their data updated on Monday,False,self,t5_2qore,True,,witchdoc-americas,t3_tke3n

Today I received this email.

 Hi Jonathan
&gt; I'm Brandon Broughton of Amazon.com's Executive Customer Relations team.
&gt; Jeff Bezos received your email and asked me to respond on his behalf.
&gt;
&gt; I'm very sorry for the trouble you've had with your pre-order of Diablo 3 CE. As a fellow Diablo player, I see you were able to place a new order. I've since upgraded this order to release day delivery, so you can start enjoying D3 from day one. In addition, I'm using this opportunity to provide training and feedback in hopes we can prevent something like this from happening in the future.

1337896509.0,u3fxw,"For those still leveling or having difficulty, here are some general tips from an A4-Inferno player regarding gear.",bigasianrichard,1423,424,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/u3fxw/for_those_still_leveling_or_having_difficulty/

*Intro

*Survival through Equipment

*Making money

*Utilizing the AH

*Conclusion

***Intro***

This will be a long read. My train of thought may wander due to me being distracted from writing this as I am at work

It is a bit appalling to see so many people complain about difficulty. Earlier in A1-Inferno, L40 tier gear in Inferno. /*yaomingface*

This game is a loot-whoring, or there's not enough of it causing prices to soar. The top DPS chart is a prime example: A few days ago it was mostly blues. Now more rares are appearing, slowly but surely eclipsing the magic items.

***Survival Tips***

From simple observation of those completing Inferno, you need to learn how to 'optimize' your equipment and know what to look for. 

Prior to reaching L51+, AP on crit, class specific buffs, melee &amp; ranged damage reduction, all resist, etc which are not available at low levels.

Now you might ask, it is easy to boost your output. ***The problem is finding armor that gives BOTH survival and DPS,*** which is a critical factor for surviving Inferno.

* Wizard - INT &amp; VIT
* Monk - DEX &amp; VIT
* Barb - STR &amp; VIT
* WD - INT &amp; VIT
* DH - DEX &amp; VIT

I think we can all agree that it is easy to find these two-stat combos for your class. The main problem is items with only these stats do not provide survival other than base HP &amp; DPS.

Here are several example affixes you should/could look for to bolster your survival rate in addition to your standard 2 stats. These higher tier stats are accessible once you reach the L-51 equipment (Hell drops)

* **All Resist (includes physical resist).** This will give you % based mitigation, and don't even get me started on elemental damage. At 600+ resist on my Wizard (I still have plenty of ways to go), going back to A1-I feels like I'm back in Hell as a L50, and makes life through A2-4 that much less harrowing. I'm starting to see items on the AH with huge +resist numbers, even into the +70s. 
* **Melee, this affix will give you additional protection against mob types you might be weak against. For example, Barbs/Monks in A2 will benefit greatly from the Ranged DMG reduction.
* **Move Speed.** This is a severely underrated stat. Not only is it convenient and awesome to traverse across open ground quickly, or microing back and forth while waiting for cooldowns. With MS you can run past packs of mobs should you choose not to fight, and not even really need any abilities (exceptions exist, a la A2). 
* **Regen.** Self explanatory, you must first be able to withstand getting 1-2shotted for this to have any value.

In addition, Crit%, CritDMG%, and other on hit effects like stun, knockback, slow, may provide extra utility in fights. Pick these according to your build. 

***Money &amp; Obtaining Rares***

With the introduction of the AH

* **Magic-find**. Very important when it comes to loot farming. I started stacking MF as soon as I reached Hell (easily over 90% by L51). Hell was not too difficult as many of you can attest, the market is a bit saturated when it comes to lower level equipment, but it's all relative. If you start early, selling items for as cheap as 2k, it beats the shit out of selling to the NPC. Gold earned is gold earned, and over time you will start to accumulate wealth. 
* **Gold-Find**. I personally have not bothered with GF
* ***NPCs** As reddit user Jakabov has mentioned

I've seen a lot of people complain about not being able to farm Inferno gear. Yes

***Auction House***

Familiarize yourself with the Auction House search features. No, it's not as exciting to many of you, but to me it's still part of the game. At the least, it's a resourceful tool to be used at your disposal. If there was no AH, there's no way I would be where I am now.

* **Overwhelmed with too many items in your search?**. Add more search criteria. Restrict it to your current level. I.e, start decreasing the scope of the search. Restrict it to 38-40. Or add a stat and put a minimum search value in. If you click on the columns, you can sort by DPS, Armor rating, or buy-out value. 
* **Finding good buys**. I find the most success by restricting my search value so I only see a few pages. This allows me to compare similar equipment to find items with the right set of stats. From there
* **Can't find something at the moment?**. Search for something else in the meantime. Look at your weakest armor piece and try to replace it. Given the huge player-base, many players will undercut to unload items faster. As a buyer, use this to your advantage. 
* **Play the market**. Use the undercutting to your advantage! Rare item with decent stats for 5k


***Conclusion***

The game has been out for a bit over a week. Yes, it's all about you having fun. Take your time, go at your own pace. If you find yourself having difficulty, stop and analyze your situation. If you have room to improve, then you know what you need to do. Sometimes it's a problem with gear. Sometimes, you might be employing the wrong strategy. This game presents you with many different *(and some bullshit, another topic)* situations. Taking that into account, try different builds. Ask a friend to help, quality equipment will soon become an affordable commodity. Perhaps that is a little bit of something we all need.

Doing this while having your inventory open should compare the item on the ground to what you currently are wearing as well. (broken1000)

2- There is a “force move” (labeled “Move” and is unbound by default) button that is unbound by default. This is helpful for running through packs of monsters and not accidentally clicking and attacking one. (need to manually bind) (kallell)

3- You can link items by bringing up the chat text box and shift+clicking an item

4- If you think you have an upgrade for someone you're playing with

5- Whites/grays sell for next to nothing and really aren't worth the inventory space outside of the first act

6- Buy +2-4 damage magic rings ASAP

7- Never sell magic items to a vendor as the crafting mats will probably sell for more in most cases (will change in retail but in beta

8- Dont waste money on bigger stash early on

9- If leveling up with a friend

Although I don't remember the exact numbers, while the jeweler will only take about ~45,000. (tolvinar)


10- You can hold left click to run around and simply tap shift to ""stutter walk"" fire instead of clicking the mouse (holding shift and casting will make you cast the ability in place

11- If you've got a big friends list and don't want people to join your game without your permission

12-If  you open your inventory (C or I)
(similar to when mousing over an item in your inventory -- shows dps changes

13- And if you hold ALT it will compare to your off-hand/equip to your off-hand

14- You need to activate lecterns yourself. It is different than a chest as only you can activate your lecterns. If they don't drop lore they can still drop gold. (rec916)

15- When you are leaving a game and the timer is counting down because you are not in town

16-Lore books give EXP

17- Elective mode (off by default). Gives MUCH more customization on where to stick your skills on your bar. (KroBa)

18 – Advanced tool tips (off by default). Shows advanced skill information such as % damage increase and what the skill does (KroBa)

19- While each player gets their own loot and gold drops

20- Hitting ""g"" will make your banner fly down wherever your mouse is pointing at. Shows off your achievements as well. (Tolvinar)

21- Hitting ""f"" will bring up your follower's (templar's) inventory. Don't forget to choose his skills and give him equipment! (Tolvinar)

22- Once you begin the fight with Jondar
That tip with Jondar will be great if they still have the achievement to kill 20 monsters in a single hit. I never managed that in the beta. (Oneironaut2)

23- Pressing ""alt"" will make items on the ground show their names for 10 seconds. The time can be adjusted in the options menu. (Tolvinar)

24- Intead of playing with your pinky on the shift key and the rest of your appendages on numbers 1-4 try this. switch the hold key from shift (default) to the spacebar. I felt it more comfortable if I played spacebar instead of shift. (spaceboundmonkeys)

25- Pressing 'Z' zooms in on your character until you press it again. (nathanstratton2010)

26- Checking  the advanced tooltips option in the game play menus will show additional item information in your inventory while holding CTRL key. (snhender)

27- Numpad 0-9 will make your character say in game phrases (both audible and to chat).  (kallell)

28- When hovering over a weapon in your inventory or a merchant it will bring up your currently equipped item to compare. However if you're dual wielding it will only bring up your primary hand. To quick view the other hand just hold alt. (dextini)

29 -You must be level 10 to do hardcore. (kallell)

30 – Your battletag is what is going to show up in game to your friends. As of now

31- Patch 1.0.1. bug - Running programs that put an overlay over Diablo III (such as Mumble

32- Treasure goblins will disappear if they are not killed fast enough. Make sure once you see them they become a priority as they can drop vast amounts of gold and loot. (kallell)

33- Gems in game drop up to rank 8 now

34 – Magic find is averaged across group members. IE: if player a has 300 mf

35- There is no “procs” for new recipes in crafting. All recipes become available on a rank by rank basis. (kallell)

36- Monster scaling (damage and HP) depends on the difficulty (norm, inferno) and players in game. Details can be seen here - http://goo.gl/BBKPU. (kallell)
**You WILL NOT get more exp per monsters the more players you have in the game. You do however

37- If you fall behind or wander off away from your party

38- Make sure to delete your D3 beta entirely (including files in programdata/battlenet) ortherwise your D3 install may not work correctly. (kallell)

39- MAKE SURE TO UPDATE GRAPHIC CARD DRIVERS (and sound card drivers if you have non-integrated ones)! This can have vast improvements on FPS. (kallell)

41- There will be two types of auction houses. RMAH and Gold AH. Gold sounds exactly like what it is. Sell and buy items off the AH with in game gold. 
With RMAH, or blizzard merchandise. YOU CANNOT cash this out. If you intend on getting cash for items, be sure to go the paypal route.(kallell) 

42- RMAH will not be available for the first week after launch. (kallell)

43-**RMAH:**
- Blizzard charges $1 + 15% transfer fee  to paypal for items. 

-For commodities Blizzard charges 15% for the item itself

**YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL $0.30 + 2.9% paypal fee**
Formulas:

Items

(Sale Price - 1)*(1-Blizzard to Paypal Transfer Fee) = Profit

(Sale Price - 1)*(1-.15) = Profit

Commodities

(Sale Price)*(1-Blizzard Commodities Fee)*(1-Blizzard to Paypal Transfer Fee) = Profit

(Sale Price)*(1-.15)*(1-.15) = Profit

What are commodities?
Crafting materials (from salvaging items)

Additional info and calculation tables - http://tinyurl.com/bnfmwfg (kallell)

44-The official authenticator should be out today (May 14th) for 6.50 + S. However
**Furthermore at the very least, etc) Info and signup is here - http://tinyurl.com/7mu68rz (kallell)

45 – Dual wielding gives 15% attack speed bonus. (riraito)

46- The best magic finding will be from killing rares around the world rather than simply boss farming (unlike d2). Every rare pack you kill

47-You can re-assign the 1234 keys to QWER (good for MOBA players)(riraito)

48 - Bosses have enrage timers. Inferno only?(kallell)

49 - Press X to show hp bars of every individual monster (altzan)

There were 12391 responses which is just over 18 responses per minute or 1 response every 3.33 seconds. I never imagined it would get this big. We actually hit the max file size for Google documents. Sorry to everyone who tried to submit but got an error.

Firstly

* From the comments

* Some questions didn't have a ""not sure"" or a ""maybe"" answer. I tried to avoid these as much as I could but some questions that needed one didn't have one. (I can't believe some people haven't used the followers yet!).

* I asked the ""Is your main class the most fun"" questions because I thought Google would only give me totals and not the detailed information.

* The survey kind of assumed you were a semi-serious gamer and that you played D2. So I apologize to the people that didn't know what a ""main class"" or who Deckard Cain was.

But enough with this stuff. On to the stats. So without further ado

**EDIT: TO VIEW SUMMARY RESULTS GO HERE:** http://imgur.com/a/HE39O

**INTERESTING FACTS** (read the results first imo)

Since I can't install any programs at work the only tool I had to parse the data was Eclipse (Java IDE) so excuse the lack of pictures.

- The average score for ""Rate Diablo 3 overall"" was ~ 7.59

- The average score for people that answered 'Yes' to ""Is your main class the most fun?"" was ~ 7.74. If you answered 'No'

- If you said you didn't use the auction house

- If you said you were an achievement hunter

- If you said you didn't like the new boss fighting mechanics

**EDIT:** [Read](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/v28yu/after_4_weeks_results/c50sk2j) what Robo-Connery has to say about how ""class does not affect the persons perception of the quality of the game"".

- Based on what you said your main class was, Witch Doctor (~7.61), Wizard (~7.59), Demon Hunter (~7.48). This is almost the opposite of how they ranked in terms of power.

- Accordingly, this game will not last"" at 15.9% and 15.6% respectively. Every other class was &lt; 15% (which is the average).

- 12.1% of Demon Hunters have beaten Diablo on Inferno difficulty with at least one character, 7.0 % of Barbarians and 5.7% of Witch Doctors.

- 49.7% of Witch Doctors think their class is the most fun. Compared to 65.8% of Barbarians.

- As you'd expect, Witch Doctors (3.7%), Wizards (2.4%) and Demon Hunters (1.7%).

- The breakdown of the ""Do you feel like enough character information is exposed?"" question by main character class almost matches the overall results (give or take 2%). In other words

- Barbarians are slightly more likely to read/listen to the lore than the other classes.

- Demon Hunters are slightly more likely to have used the RMAH (buying or selling)

- 12% of Demon Hunters think that the Scoundrel is the best follower for ranged compared to 6% of Wizards and 6% of Witch Doctors. (I will add that this question couldnt be skipped and some people haven't used the followers yet so it could be skewed)

- 64% of the 117 people who chose Magdha as their favourite new character said that they listened to the lore (""stayed awhile and listened"").

- 242 Redditors who answered 'Yes' to ""Is your class the most powerful?"" didn't answer the question ""Which class is the most powerful?"" with their main class. 115 Redditors answered 'No' and then actually put their own class.

1.04 made two big improvements. First

I think more content like that first bullet point would really help the game's longevity. Here are some ideas: 


* **Enchantments**: Bringing the enchanter NPC into the game and letting enchanted gear be transferred or placed on the auction house but destroying the enchantments when moved to a different account (via trade

* **Account bound gear:** Probably account bound on equip. These items could either be sprinkled into the loot table or drop as special rewards. It would allow the drop rate for some good gear to be dramatically increased

* **Bind on pickup aesthetic enhancements:** Particle effects, auras, demon wings, whatever. Stuff that will be fun to find but won't imbalance the game.

* **Endless dungeon:** Stat rewards

* **Follower rewards:** Unlock an extra few gear slots for followers.

Act I. Why would Belial need Tyrael? Trust. Tyrael makes the worst decisions but is loved by humanity; saving him will instantly remove the agent of Belial (the PC) from suspicion.

Act II. Tyrael and our gang are hunting down the last lords of hell to put them into the Soulstone. Ever wondered why the Belial boss is twenty times bigger than the Prime Evil? And how he isn't the least bit sneaky

Cinematic with Azmodan--Azmodan addresses Diablo inside Leah; he knows of Adria's plot. If Belial is the Lord of Lies

Act III. Azmodan is a master strategist; but, thus allowing you to thwart them. Would a master strategist do that? No. The visions of Azmodan are not of Azmodan at all, but are conjured up by Belial so the player character can react to Azmodan's plans without suspicion. 

Act IV. Diablo, he reveals his plans--as before, this is Belial's predictions, manifested in false visions. Diablo is, of course, defeated, and his defeat total--he and the other six lords of hell are imprisoned in the Soulstone, and become the true Prime Evil,self,

Diablo 3 Is a good game

Most posts on this subreddit (86.2%+) are all negative. People are criticizing Bashiok and saying the game is poorly designed. 

If you are one of the people that keeps posting they are shelving the game then:
- Quit the game

If there's is a change of redeeming your soul

So I will say now, but I think the AH itself is terrible and could of been done considerably better. Its small things like this that make the difference, It would be more forgivable if it was Blizzards first game, but considering the WoW auction house is pretty much perfect, then why can't they borrow the ideas? 

There have been a lot of Bugs

This is where we get to the bit I fully support Bashiok one:

For the first month of release, they actually ask the community what it is they want). 

The Design preview was received relatively well, largely the patch notes were very uplifting and I felt like we, as a community, were being listed too. 

Most people whining on the SubReddit are complaining about IAS. Are you serious? IAS was way too overpowered

I think the damage nerf in Inferno is a a slight shame, and I was a bit miffed that DPS wasn't viable for me unless I spent ungodly amounts of gold. 

I **do** think Bashiok's PR skills need a bit of work


I think, and the constant criticism of how your DPS has gone from 100k to 90k should be dropped. I understand Negative criticism is important, but every post on the front page at the moment is whining about the patch. 2 weeks ago, it was whining that we needed a patch!

Life is hardcore mode

So here are some tips on keeping you chained to the mortal realm in the short term (for long term tips


&gt; Don't answer the door for anyone.

   You don't know who's knocking. It could be the pizza guy but it could also NOT be the pizza guy. Play it safe.


&gt; Don't go outside.

   Outside is a dangerous place filled with dangerous dangers. Depending on where you live, Hell, or Inferno (the Inferno designation is relegated to Camden, NJ). But guess what? We're basically all lvl 1 hardcore characters, so even normal difficulty can mean your demise. Whether its getting bludgeoned by an undesirable outside the corner store or  run down on the sidewalk during Jenny's first driving lesson in her brand new BMW, it's better to play it safe and confine yourself to your house for the next 32 hours.


&gt; Don't live near an airport.

   For those that haven't seen Donny Darko, if you do live near an airport, relocate...without going outside.


&gt; Keep your chimpanzee chained up.

   You can't play without a face.


&gt; Only eat foods that are high in quality

   These include foods that are sealed up in cans, but that may be playing it a little too safe.


&gt; Don't make your significant other angry.

  All of the sources say that you are most likely to be murdered by someone close to you. So, at a distance. If they ask you why you're acting weird just smile, say I love you, and slink awkwardly out of the room. If your significant other is a female, make sure to have bowls of dark chocolate littered throughout the house to keep them sated and blissful.


&gt; Finally

   Stay completely alert at all times. Be adroit and dexterous. If you keep aware that your life hangs by a thread


If you follow this guide, people. We can do this. Good luck.

About 6 months after the drawing, a box arrived at my parents apartment in South Dakota. Not having ordered anything, they were curious as to why it had shown up. When they opened the box there were five things inside. A long yellow envelope, a copy of Diablo, a black hat with Blizzard in blue printed on the front, and a blue statue of Diablo that stand a little over a foot tall.

**Fury Generation**

First of all you'll notice that there is no usual fury generator

Your bread and butter for fury generation - and also a great single target nuke - is Ancient Spear, allowing you to generate another 30 fury - if you hadn't guessed yet, high crit chance is a big part of this build.

War Cry is the other main fury generator

90 fury will only get you so far, each individual crit has a chance to generate 14 fury. While unlikely it is possible to generate 32 fury with a single Weapon Throw ([3*14] - 10).

**Gear and Stats**

For this build you are going to want crit chance. However

The best weapon to be using with this build is a 2 handed mace. This is because your damage relies entire on cooldown spells (Ancient Spear) and a fury spender (Weapon Throw). The low attack speed high damage of a 2 handed mace will give you the most punch for your fury (and cooldown). It is also necessary to use a mace/axe to recieve the 10% crit chance from Weapons Master.

For people curious about the viability of might weapons with this build - Weapons Master does not seem to generate fury with Weapon Throw. Sometimes the first hit seemed to generate 3 fury and sometimes none at all, aslong as there were 3 enemies to hit.

High crit chance goes hand in hand with high crit damage

You don't need to tank up quite so much with this build as you will be aiming to stay away from the enemies and kiting them

**Skill Rundown**

I already wrote a lot on Ancient Spear and War Cry so I will skip over those skills in this section.

Weapon Throw is your main damage skill in this build
The fact that each individual crit with Ricochet can generate fury makes it mostly self-sustaining against hordes of enemies with ~30% crit. Versus bosses

Battle Rage is just a great self buff

The remaining 2 spells Furious Charge and Ground Stomp come down to personal preference. These are basically the defensive skills, it doesn't work very well with this particular build. Furious Charge can be replaced with Leap if you are more comfortable with it. However, I chose the charge for my escape as with the Merciless Assault rune escaping through enemies keeps the cooldown low, and having your escape off-cooldown is always good.

**Gameplay**

First of all let me say the build is really FUN to play. Especially after having played lots of hours hitting things at melee range. Its great to mix things up.

The way the build usually works is you start a fight with Warcry for 60 fury, go again! Now start spamming Weapon Throw. The great thing is it applies a 2 second 60% slow! Spamming it into a horde very quickly applies this slow to all the enemies, making kiting a breeze. The damage on each throw is also great because you're using a 2 handed mace. 

For the most part your fury should self-sustain with just Weapon Throw spam as long as you dont leave combat for too long you wont actually need to recast Warcry

So you basically just run around kiting enemies

I should probably note here that this build is exceptionally weak to vortex champions

**Conclusion**

This build is really fun and a way for Barbarians to play range that is viable and works. I know many of you will be skeptical about becoming fury starved but I say try it! If you get over 30% crit chance then the chances of getting fury starved become almost impossible.

Let me know what you think! Anything that could be changed/improved?

EDIT: This is random but I just confirmed that you can crit scenery

EDIT2: Please note I have only tried this out in Nightmare so far, ""Currently I'm at Inferno Act 2, I solo'ed with some cooperative gameplay with my friend to Inferno Act 1, from there I have progressed mostly in cooperative fashion"".

Let me tell you - this one was more difficult.

A redditor by the name of codeninja has been giving me ideas for gearing cheaply for Act 3 and 4. As long as I can get by Ghom

If anyone has any questions - please post them here or in the Youtube video. I'm more than happy to give out gearing and speccing advice for Monks.

I'd also highly encourage other classes to make similar videos (or even Monks - try to do it even cheaper). A lot of people have requested that I make similar videos for the other classes. I do have a Witch Doctor - but I have no idea how to play it at the same level I play my Monk.

Speaking of others - I was informed that someone else was doing similar challenges (one million gold for Acts 3 and 4). If you're a Barbarian

Why should you believe what I have to say? A picture is worth a thousand words

**1. IDENTIFYING POSSIBLE SALES**

When a piece of gear drops

1. Weapons

If a 1-handed weapon has 900+ DPS OR 600+ DPS and 500+ life on hit, you want 1100+ DPS to consider selling it. Lower DPS with Life on Hit is not as valuable on 2-handed weapons as it is on 1-handed.

Bows are valued a little differently than other weapons. For 2-handed bows

2. Armor

Armor can be a little tricky to figure out what will sell and what won't. For convenience, and SECONDARY. UNIQUE stats are only found on small numbers of slots, and thus are very important to have on slots that can have it. PRIMARY are useful for everyone of a given class, and SECONDARY are generally not as useful. If you have a LEGENDARY that contains a UNIQUE not generally found in that slot, it will be valuable.

    UNIQUE
    Crit Chance (Gloves, Ring, Helm, Off-Hand)
    Crit Damage (Gloves
    Attack Speed (Gloves
    Socket (Helm -- consider sockets in other slots as +40 stat of choice)
    Life On Hit (Amulet
    Movement Speed (Boots)
    Max Discipline (Demon Hunter Chest
    (Other class-specific? Unsure)

    PRIMARY
    Strength
    Dexterity
    Intelligence
    Vitality
    All Resist
    Gold Find
    Magic Find

    SECONDARY
    Everything Else

Now, as well as the number needed to sell for that slot. FOR ANY SLOT, you can sell with less stats if they are VERY HIGH (e.g. 200+ main stat, 25 gf, 20 mf, etc.) Note that the more possible ""good"" affixes in a slot, the more you need to have the item be worthwhile to sell. Prices vary wildly by slot

	18+ MF (any slot except helm, which needs 30+)
	23+ GF (any slot except helm, which needs 35+)
	200+ Life On Hit Ring
	600+ Life On Hit Amulet
	
OK, the more valuable.

**2. HOW TO SELL ITEMS**

1. Armor

First, and all resist. If you don't have three useful stats, only use two (or one!). Select the type of armor, and enter in rounded numbers below your item's numbers. If it has 136 dex, search for 130. 200 dex, search for 190. You get the point. Enter that in for all stats, you are searching for. Finally

Sort your results by lowest buyout (click buyout twice). Depending on how good your item is, and check the prices. If the first item on the list is 1d10h or 1d11h, post a buyout 10% less than it to sell. If it is a lower period of time, post a buyout 25% less to sell. Initial bid prices are up to you, but I usually post initial bid as 25% of my buyout price on normal (read: not godly) items.

2. Weapons

Identify your top three stats as with armor,000. Click search and look at the top DPS. Is it more than your weapon? Sorry, not worth selling. Is it less? Change buyout to 100,000 and look again. Continue adjusting buyout until the top DPS weapon matches yours. Subtract 10% from that max buyout you just discovered, and use that as your buyout.

3. God-tier items

If you follow the instructions of searching based on your item and absolutely nothing pops up even when you subtract a bit from the stats you search for

4. Items with 4+ useful stats

These are tricky to sell. Pick 3 and filter as normal. Now, and undercut that by the standard 10-25%.

**3. CONCLUSION**

I know this was a huge wall of text. I hope it was useful for somebody -- most of this was just instinct for me and this is my first attempt to put it into steps to follow. If there are any problems with this or you have suggestions

* Clouds in Whimsyshire fall under the same chests/destructible objects loot nerf (could be deemed as expected from patch notes

* IAS is nerfed more than 50%. 50% nerf is the best case scenario. For most items its around 60% and for weapons it is higher (as high as 75%).

* IAS items did a re-roll on stats in their category. You could have a high roll in the range of the original category that re-rolls low on the new category range.

* Act 2 nagas before waterlogged passage replaced with a single named elite.

* Dank Cellar Sarkoth now fights

* Event in Festing Woods changes spawn locations now

* Belial powerleveling patched

* Goblins gained immunity to barbaian's hook when portaling away

* Mythic potions drops nerfed? Could be related to destructible items

* You can no longer force the same instance of a map by reloading a game. It will randomly pick a map every time. If you want the same map you'll have to load up several games.

* Whimsyshire staff plans changed from 1 gold cost to 50k gold for hell. 100k for inferno. nightmare =15k

* Certain popular crafting recipes ninja nerfed to higher costs. Such as Seven Sins and all pieces in Sage's set.

* Dank Cellar goblin runs nerfed

* Gold spammers muted/banned better

* Act 3 pop-up mines no longer do 400k damage to enemies. They now do about 50k.

* Monk spirit regen has changed to a cap of 6.18

* Diablo didn't used to spawn a shadow in Phase 2 for any dead players. Now it spawns a shadow regardless of whether they are alive or not.

* Iskatu loot nerfed even more. Now he might drop nothing or a single white.

* Smoke screen no longer usable while frozen despite other skills being enabled.  Conflicting reports. Some say yes

* Cemetery elite changed to purple mob (no NV)  

* Half price potion vendor in Act 1 removed from game

* ctrl + r bugs and only shows 0 framerate

I hope I got that in a nice compressed list so that you don't have to scroll through a million comments like I just did.

EDIT: I should have called it ninja nerfs AND patches. It started with compiling a list of nerfs but the list grew. Yes not all of them are technically nerfs (like getting rid of some of the gold seller spam) as some of you pointed out.

The /r/diablo moderation has team never stopped trying to promote a congenial, dynamic thing, so we gave it room to grow on its own.

The intensity of hatred in /r/diablo since release has been astounding, positive or negative. The moderation team has no desire to control what people want to say. This subreddit will always be a place to discuss Diablo.

But we also remember our original goals. We want /r/diablo to be a friendly place. Now, including less tolerance for empty hatefulness and a more persistent application of the zero-merit-post rule.

**To the people who like the game but are sick of the negativity:**

Hang in there. The Blizzard-bashers and indiscriminate antagonists won't last forever. In the months since release

**To the people who are waiting for everything to suddenly become perfect:**

Go play something else for a while; take your mind off it. Patches will come, or maybe it won't. Maybe you'll never love it. Accept that, move on, and try again later. You'll have more fun that way.

Also after these trades we made an agreement for 1500 euro on my axe if we would trade EF's for the time being

With that being said the story is as follows; Cro paid me 1000 euro on the 20th for the amulet and 1500 euro for the ring on the 21st of june. The following day on the 22nd this money was blocked by paypal due possible unauthorized usage of a creditcard, Paypal requires full names of the buyer and seller to keep proper documentation of trades.

On the 6th of July the money was released by paypal in the afternoon, they said it could take 1-3 days but if he would link the card that he used to his new account it would be available within a day. Also they 100% guaranteed me that he would have received a message in his paypals mail about the money being refunded, which many of us paypal users could confirm from experience.

With all this being said Cro was unbelievable hard to reach after the refund took place

All I can really say after all this is that I have been CRO'D and I hope that nobody else has been or will be, have a nice day.

Edit: cro claiming the PP was not his, so I don't see the issue with him streaming the PP history. Also saying I wanted the items back because he had larger offers, I hardly even been online since the trade took place, 2500 euro is more than enough also I never asked for the items if he just simply pays me. Also he is saying I sent him back the money however if you look in the detailed payment screenshots under Status you can see: Reversed, paypal reversed this payment because of a dispute or payment review. The money has been returned to the sender's Paypal account.

I am only searching for the base stats of the item. I can include 'has sockets' in the search if I want sockets.

1339628643.0,v0nqa,"To Auction House, Salvage, or Sell: A Guide",Gigged,869,213, these are the rules I usually stick to during my own farming sessions to give me the best results. (EDIT - This is for softcore AH only - don't use this if you play hardcore).   

**I. What Goes on the AH**   

Ideally, so they can just be sold or salvaged. Here are my general rules for each type of piece:   

**Armor Generally**- The following are stat combos I look for on a piece where I think it will sell for 10k+ on the AH. If no number is listed for the stat

- 15%+ magic find

- 18%+ gold find

- 220+ dex

- 220+ int

- 100+ int / 100+ vit

- 100+ (int or vit) / 50+ All Resist (AR)

- 100+ dex / 30+ (any resist) / 50+ AR

- (int or str or dex) / vit / AR

- vit / AR / armor  

If the piece has a socket

**Special Armor Rules** - The following pieces have additional stats to look out for that may alter the above list.  

* **Helm** - Needs 20%+ magic/gold find in the absence of a socket. With an empty socket, it needs this amount to be worth selling on that stat alone)

* **Bracer** - Crit chance of 5%+

* **Gloves** - Keep anything with 13%+ Attack Speed (IAS). 8%+ crit chance and/or 25%+ crit damage can sub for another useful stat on the general armor list with int/dex gear.

* **Boots** - 11%+ movement speed can be subbed for a useful stat on the general armor list with int/dex gear.

* **Amulet** - Needs 20%+ magic/gold find to keep based on that alone. Also, 7%+ crit chance, or 60%+ crit damage. These numbers can be lowered if paired with each other or any other useful stat.

* **Rings** - Exact same rules as Amulet, save it.  

**Weapons** - As we all know, can change based on the following, which I've roughly put in DPS terms (so a stat labeled -50 DPS means that a 1-hander with that stat should be kept at 650+ DPS, etc.)
  
* Hand-Crossbows: +100 DPS

* Bows / Crossbows: -75 DPS

* Cold Damage (X-bow Only): -150 DPS

* 100+ dex/int/vit: -50 DPS

* Socket: -50 DPS

* 50%+ Critical Hit Damage: -50 DPS

* 150+ Life on Hit (1h Only): -100 DPS  


**Off-Hands** - I'm by no means an expert at this slot

* Sources/Mojos - The biggest factor is the +damage

* Quivers - (Edit - credit to not_a_haddock) Good ones have some combination of 100+ dex, 14%+ IAS, and +x% of elemental arrow.

* Shields - Ideally, and 1100+ armor, plus a few useful stats (dex/vit/Life %/AR mainly).

Beyond these tips

**II. I've found an item I should AH. Now what?**  

To effectively list gear on the AH, let's say you have some shoulders with 150 int, 50 vit, and 35 AR - in this case ""int"" is your primary stat. What you then want to do is search for shoulders using tight parameters for your primary stat, and looser parameters for the others. Here then, I would do a search for all shoulders with a minimum 140 int (tight), 25 vit (loose), and price myself under the lowest that comes up under that search.  

By doing this, chances are they are priced appropriately and you don't need to undercut much. If they have been up a while, however, you may need to price substantially lower to ensure a sale.  

Finally

* Don't sweat heavily undercutting when you are sitting on a bag full of things that need to be put up on the AH. The 10 item limit can become a huge bottleneck toward making money

* If you need to clear some bag space quick

* *Always* socket your items with plain squares (not flawless

* Utilize the string of 9s. There is a reason every store in the world does it - 99, especially when listed next to each other. Selling everything with trailing 9s is a great way of minimally undercutting and still selling your gear quickly. 
 

**III. This item is trash. Do I sell it

This answer may change over time depending on whether the essence market remains constant
 
* **Salvage** all level 60 gear and level 59 rings

* **Sell** all other gear (first checking that your level 55 weapon isn't a level 60 in disguise with a reduced level requirement!).  

Right now

So that's what I've learned so far after a few weeks of farming and learning the AH. There have been countless times I've almost salvaged something such as a blue amulet with solely 500 life on hit only to check the AH and end up selling it for half a million

The problem that many are encountering now trying to sell on the AH is that most people have been at 60 for a while and have been constantly upgrading for weeks. The AH is flooded with mediocre gear that doesn't sell. The people who are leveling alts have enough gold to buy high end gear for them

Here are the guidelines I use when deciding what goes to auction: [Ashmedai](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1037ft/auction_house_some_general_guidelines_for_what_to/c6a0xm3), [kolchin04](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1037ft/auction_house_some_general_guidelines_for_what_to/c6a2l42)

* Helm: main stat + vit or %life or all resist + crit chance + socket

* Shoulders: main stat + vit + all resist

* Chest: &gt;100 main stat + vit + all resist + three sockets

* Amulets: &gt;100 main stat + at least two of ( &gt;5% crit chance

* Shields: &gt;18% block chance + &gt;8% crit chance + main stat + vit + all resist

* Two hand bow/xbow: &gt;1000 dps + main stat + random stat (prefer crit damage!!) + socket

* Two hand others: &gt;1100 dps + main stat + random stat + socket

* One hand: &gt;900 dps + main stat + random stat (vit, crit damage!!) + socket

 also - 800+ LoH, socket, 250+ str, vit are valuable regardless of dps for double nado barbs

* Quivers: &gt;125 dex + &gt;8% crit chance + at least one of ( +discipline
                 
  Add a socket, &gt;10% damage to hungering arrow or elemental arrow ) for bonus bucks

Barb: [HeLLsBeLLs1428](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1037ft/auction_house_some_general_guidelines_for_what_to/c6a1swr)

* Mighty Belts: life steal + &gt;150 str + &gt;100 vit + &gt;50 resist all 

* Good str gear that also has a high roll on physical damage to attackers

* Mojos: &gt;300 damage is valuable (ex. something like 50-350 is nice) + high int + high vit 

 Mana regen is nice

 Add attack speed

* Good int gear that also has pickup radius is very desirable

* Good int gear that also has a high roll on physical damage to attackers

* Good int gear that has &gt;5000 bonus to health globes

* Mana Regen on Ceremonial Knives and Helms is a plus

* Reduced Cost of Zombie Chargers is a plus

Wizard: [_shift](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1037ft/auction_house_some_general_guidelines_for_what_to/c6a2lwl)

* Arcane Power on Crit is very desirable on sources and weapons
 
 Triumvirate with no AP on Crit sells for 0-20m depending on damage. AP on crit skyrockets the price.

* Helms with 4% crit chance and 9+ arcane power on crit are valuable

* For CM/Spectral Blades wizards

* Source with over 300 damage is valuable

Monk: [Splitshadow](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1037ft/auction_house_some_general_guidelines_for_what_to/c6afxab)

* Rings and amulets with max/near-max GF and MF will sell regardless of other stats

* Max/near-max GF or MF on other good items as listed above can greatly increase their value

* By itself on rings and amulets

* High end items with MF are worth more than the equivalent with GF

* Combination of gold find and increased pick up radius adds value to armor

* Helms with MF + socket + main stat + all resist/vit sell well because you can add a GF/MF gem

**Other considerations:** [HeLLsBeLLs1428](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1037ft/auction_house_some_general_guidelines_for_what_to/c6a1ilp)

* At least 12 reduced level requirement will sell for a lot more

* High LoH rolls add value - &gt;150 on rings

* High +armor rolls add value

**Big ticket items:** (A work in progress) [Kallell](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1037ft/auction_house_some_general_guidelines_for_what_to/c69zuoy)

* Helms with main stat + &gt;70 all resist + &gt;4.5% crit chance + socket

Well that's your problem Blizz... you have taken the ""hunt"" out of ""item hunt"". 

While I think PvP, etc. all present problems and/or areas for D3 to currently improve on, I think right now, at least for me, the most glaring problem is the ""item hunt."" 

For better or worse

In D2, set item, or rare rune. 

In D3, or b) dread to see how bad the random props are going to be on this one... 

So instead of hunting clearly identified uniques which literally have legendary properties

1) It turns off the ""joy"" you should feel when you kill a difficult mob/boss

2) We are using SPREADSHEETS to determine if we should use the new ""uber"" item we just found. That's insane. In D2, not ""well... it reduces my AR by 20, but gets me an extra 400 DPS..."" 

3) In D2 uniques/sets were literally, knew what build they were good for, etc. etc. In D3, a casual gamer, who currently has 1 maybe 2 developed toons, very well might have no idea what constitutes an ""uber"" drop another class. So in D2 when I was a Sorc and saw IK Chest drop i thought: ooh... I can trade this. In D3 as a wizard, I honestly don't know what stats are considered good for other classes. 

Now some of you may tell me that is my own fault

TL;DR: In my humble opinion (which I know some disagree with)

**edit: wow, but it really is a form of psychological training:**

**In D2 when we saw a rune or great gold/green drop we were excited, even if we find a great item, we probably won't realize we found it until 15-20 min later (after we finish the  run/max our stash) and not until after we consulted a EPH/DPS spreadsheet or checked the AH for like prices. So now, not only is our excitement delayed/subdued, but it is directly connected to an out-of-game event.** ",,False,t5_2qore,True

My friends and I sat down and started figuring out how to fix this (we really spent hours theorycrafting)

Act 2+ is ENTIRELY about defensive stats. Do NOT care about your DPS. Build for survivability and THEN add dps later once you get really perfect pieces (that have your D-stats and also O-stats).

Vitality is the least important defensive stat. For most of the game you can just add more vit to brute force your way through bosses

Armor

Using Monk's Mantra of Evasion (+15% dodge, and then suddenly... you can survive. Once you have damage down to a managable level the next necessary element is life-gain. If you are taking incoming 3k DPS but have also 3k HPS, you are solid. 

Barb uses life-stealing abilities(such as revenge) and is very good with groups of mobs

I can see in my spreadsheet that my 37k HP, before I actually died), and while I keep my temporary dodge-boosters up its actually over 2million.

We started act 3 and its also fine. Things have a lot of HPs so we need to increase our dps a bit now but tanking is cake. Once we get the right DPS we will be able to farm higher-level acts efficiently and without the frustration of constant dying and kiting.

BTW

1340398441.0,vgbzl,Mo Ferrets Mo Problemz,JtLJudoMan,809,181,147,"First a bit of back story.  I wanted to play WD since I heard about it and D3.  Did not care about DH at all.  Heard about the DH as a class and thought ""Bleh I've already been a bowazon"".  

All of that changed when I found the glorious ability of Demon Hunters - Summon Ferrets.

This spell gives you two ferrets that follow you around - attack crap - and pick up gold.  Easily the coolest idea for any spell in the game.  The mere idea of two little critters scampering around my feet and picking up gold and shit is just so obscenely awesome that I immediately decided that a Demon Hunter would be my main.

I then played the living hell out of the Demon Hunter class and the following is my dissertation on ferrets; what they are doing right

The first time I summoned my ferret companions my immediate reaction was ""holy shit that's cute as hell"".  (Done right).

I then proceeded to run around a bit and I lost a ferret (shit I'm a terrible pet owner).  Suddenly wtf

So I proceeded to test the ferrets out for awhile.  They would scamper around and pick up gold for me as one two headed ferret.  Generally always taking the exact same path to the same lump of gold

A few of the things I noticed that made them rather poor at their primary function of gold gathering.

1) They apparently have 0 pickup radius. (Occasionally they will just sit on top of a pile of gold for what seems like forever until they randomly twitch slightly and pick it up)

2) They are incredibly slow.  (I found myself occasionally just standing still in the middle of a group of gold waiting for them to pick it all up and realized that I could do it faster by just getting 5-10 gold radius).

3) They always attack mobs, pretty much anything - Plus they do not loot gold while fighting things so their primary function is shelved.)

4) They generally act as one glorified ferret which is unfortunate because they could theoretically be twice as efficient.


The way to fix the above problems in order.
1) Give them a pickup radius of like 1.  There is literally no harm in it and the ferrets wouldn't get stuck trying to pick crap up anymore.

2) They need to be quite a lot faster.  Why do they run at the same speed as I do when they should run much much faster to catch up and collect the gold?

3) Please have them only aggro things once the owner has attacked it and have them loot during fights as well.  Their dps is so low that it really wouldn't matter if all they did was run around during fights picking up gold.  At least you wouldn't have to wait on it.

4) Somehow the ferrets need to repulse each other so that they are not always pathing as one object.  Perhaps have a rule that the ferrets never go within 10 yards of another ferret.  OR make a rule that one ferret always goes for the gold at the left first and the other ferret always goes for the gold on the right first.  And have them always prefer opposite shoulders of the DH.  So that they would never become a two headed ferret again.

Thank you for reading!  Hopefully someone enjoyed it.

Blizzard either need to **embrace** the way things work by letting us manage weapon/armour sets and switching between them easily with a keybind (WoW style)

* Divide gear into various categories and the type of enchant one can apply on a piece of gear depends on the type of gear in question.
* Leave core stats like STR/INT/DEX to powerful items like weapons and off-hands. MF should never have to compete with these or no one will ever pick them unless they have godly gear already.
* Pieces of armour could be enchanted with less valuable stats like Magic Find, etc.
* Rings and amulets could house defensive stat enchants like resistances

*(The above is just one example of how to categorize items)*

 You could organize small teams (guilds) which allow your team and individuals to be ranked on a ladder. 

Edit: to build on this idea

Each town has a portal to some instances. Once your team enters, eg one instance in the Cathedral, slightly harder to get to, but people now have another reason to clear a dungeon. 

You don't lose money/repair costs in these PVPE instances. 

Depending on the instance

Edit2:

Great ideas guys, where the goal is to complete pve type instances but adding pvp for variability, team competition, new strategies and factors, etc. that way you get drops, xp, and gold but also perks and points towards a ladder or perhaps gear.

1337547108.0,twfsi,Does anyone else feel this subreddit is overreacting to the potential issues?,,1025,437,609,"
It seems to me there are a few issues that get brought up often and I think they're sort of unfounded. Here's my take on the major 4:

**1. Inferno is too easy:**
This is a total misnomer IMO: the only groups that have managed it ghosted their way through and didn't actually beat it. They didn't beat it in my book, then I'll consider it cleared. 

**2. Itemization is screwed up:** While this may be correct, that doesn't mean that Blizzards official interpretation of itemization is batshit insane. No one has a full set of endgame gear, no one has even figured out the optimal way of beating Inferno!

I for one think that stats like health range pickup and other seemingly peripheral affixes will prove to be very useful for inferno

**3. Not enough viable builds:** I don't see a logical basis for such a conclusion. We have not experimented with many builds as of yet, I can't even begin to call that design failure.

**4. Elites/champions too hard, or kill you in more interesting ways. It would be nonsensical (except maybe for Barb's? my experience is limited to DH and anecdotes from wizard playing friend) for a player to have so many heals as to completely mitigate elites/champions damage. Without D2's incredibly flawed method of health pot spamming, you shouldn't ever be standing toe-to-toe with champs/elites. Kiting and controlling are the ONLY possible methods of killing them, inherent in game design.

What do you guys think of an ""Endless Wave"" zone that would unlock after you beat Diablo on Inferno.

Elite mob spawns could be timed, 1 hour). Personally, I love would to see some cheesy ""BOSS FIGHT NEW EVENT"" mechanic!

I'm an average gamer; some might call me a ""casual"" by today's gaming standards. 23 years old

Back in high school, if not more, playing Diablo as I did in class.

I made a barbarian. His name was Bolbor. Leveled into the 80s and did a real fun Whirlwind build with lots of life-steal. I was the mesmerized kid manually farming for gear, traded around for some cool gear to make a Meteor/Frost Orb sorceress, rinse and repeat. I lived the Sanctuary dream, as it were.

Rose-tinted nostalgia aside, math class, stupid, complex, rewarding, frustrating, and when I saw the prettiest green or gold text fall to floor, it was entertaining and it was fun. 

I loved that game.

Fast forward to Diablo 3. I have a full-time job. A loving girlfriend. Bills to pay. Send money to my mom when I can. I'm time-poor. March 15

I waited nearly a decade for this game

I resurrected my old barbarian friend. Bolbor lived!  and made it to 60 in a week. In hindsight, smashing everything the same way I imagined my old pixelated barbarian doing. 

And I played through Hell. Again. And again. And when I saw the same golden yellow text that always gave me a sweet pixely high

Then it happened. Orange. Orange text! My first legendary dropped. It was a [Blackguard](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/blackguard). Holy crap

""Check the stats

Oh. Hmm. Yeah

Then the RMAH came out, I figured maybe I could treat myself to a nice String of Ears, Helm of Command, Ivory Tower, and a better amulet. 

The $50 went as quick as it came. ""Send to stash."" Click! ""Resume game."" Click! I actually felt excited to see how badass Bolbor would be now.

Imagine the smug grin on my face when I could finally tank the Act 1 inferno elites with relative ease. Sure

But the satisfaction was fleeting. I found myself asking

$50 had bought me nothing. The pixels were there

I don't know what happened. I feel like it wasn't supposed to be like this. I still want to play the game. I still want that high. I waited so long for it.

**TL;DR:** I'm scared. I'm scared for the game

Almost invariably when a friend of mine in the above category complains about the patch, with 200+ dex and some random stat for 1m+ on the AH, because I know most DHs up till now have ignored everything else except for crit/ias/crit damage where they can get it, and in every other slot, dex is all that matters. As a melee character, I wouldn't have paid 50k for a piece of equipment without resists/high armor. We couldn't afford to do that because what's the point of high damage if we get 2 shotted whenever we get within range of enemies?

The new patch has essentially tweaked the mob damage so that characters with high damage mitigation will notice a HUGE difference between the lethality of enemies now and pre-patch. I can literally stand afk next to a (single) soul ripper, but usually my enchantress will have killed the soul ripper before he could kill me. Before the patch (and after tyrael nerf) I couldn't take the siege breaker past three quarters of his health. I can now completely face tank him and, usually, my life won't dip below 50%. I don't know the numbers, but whatever blizz did, the damage reduction of mob is HUGE if you have been stacking resists/armor.

On the other hand, and glass cannons would notice very little in terms of a difference.

There are games out there that have a similar style game mode sepperate from the main game. The famous [Call of Duty](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAOoVvGMzHk) zombie mode, [Borderlands: Mad Moxxi arena](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq_cxqQZoy8), [Gears of War](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp_POS-xJNQ) etc... There was even a very old trailer for a coliseum type event in WoW but Blizzard never implemented it (Trial of Crusader doesnt count :P ), where players fight against spawning waves of monsters.

In these modes you fight against endless waves of progressively harder monsters

Edit: In my mind I had an image of a big graveyard arena

Edit 2: Im sorry if some think this is a repost

**TLDR: I wanted a game mode where I can put the gear I have earned to use and not just farm more gear with it.

Yes there are similar events ingame but I felt they were not pushed far enough.**

Something similar has been happening to me as I have played D3 from beta until now.  I have been trying to explain why the D3 economy has imploded and how to fix it but it seems like I'm doomed to stand by and watch it happen.  Below is an aggregation of several posts that I have made.  I have posted similar things on official and other unofficial fora as well with very little reception.  Please feel free to ask questions

* D2 was good because the economy of SOJ's was a free market and only crashed after massive inflation due to duping.  Well, there is no way to remove anything from the economy other than players rage quitting because the economy sucks... 

* **Each player brings in untold thousands of gems

[Read more about this position here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/149h9x/what_is_really_happening_with_the_economy_is_it/c7b4y4u)

I have identified two major issues and I will summarize each below: 

* There must be **actual diversity** among the classes and there must be **productive destruction** of items

----

**Productive Destruction:**

Currently,000 gold; and salvaging an item is stupid since crafting is an utter waste (I've given it a good 50m faith effort and it was a GIANT net loss). 

Gems have no final use

Productive Destruction can be done by many ways

* Rerolling items by putting gems and items into the Crucible
* 3x Gem + 3x same Item + gold = Item Reroll with guaranteed roll of stat relative to Gem
* 1 of each gem + item + gold = item with guaranteed socket

----

**Diversity of classes:**  

Currently, and Crit %

This has destroyed the economy because anything without these three properties is worthless

* To fix this problem: 

Blizzard needs to actually implement diversity among the classes.  Some suggestions: 

* Barbarian ability that cannot crit but does more dmg the more Thorns damage the player has.  

* Wizard Fire spell that is channeled and does not crit but does more dmg the lower the APS and does not rely on the DPS number on the weapon.  

* Witch Doc ability that siphons life from enemies as a function of vitality that does not crit; when the mob dies

* Monk passive that allows any base stat to give %dmg instead of just Dex.  But its balanced so that if he goes +/- 10%

* Monk ability that does more dmg and steals more life/more life on hit the closer to .8 APS the monk gets.  

----
Please let me know if you have any questions.  If you'd like a more thorough economics analysis

Thanks for reading! 

----

**Edit 1** 

I am adding a great suggestion from Ashmedai: 
----
I'd suggest a system like this:

* The player goes to the mystic

* Any item to improve an item binds the item to the players account.

* Attempts to improve can be either ""slow

* Both slow and fast methods can improve items the same amount

* The risky method has a chance of destroying an item.

* Investment costs would be gold

* The types of improvements and changes to items are left to your imagination.

I see streamers such as Kripp complaining about the game saying that it's broken then he continues to play 10 hours a day for months.

I see people who have logged 300+ hours in like three months whining about how there's nothing to do in the game.  People saying how broken and unfun and tedious the game is then they go back to farming for the rest of the week.

How many other games have you bought and logged that many hours?

It is just crazy that people expect to be able to play a game 6-8 hours a day everyday for months and expect to not be bored.  I think part of the problem is that people do not understand how much time and effort it takes to make a polished Triple A game like D3.  

I know I'll probably be downvoted to oblivion for not hating on Blizzard but I just had to vent some steam after reading these forums.  The level of false entitlement is excruciating.  Blizzard doesn't owe anybody anything.

EDIT: Every comment I made is downvoted to oblivion? Really guys?  This subreddit is almost as bad as the Blizzard forums.  

I was not trying to start some discussion about how Blizzard has failed everyone.  All I was trying to get across is that, move on, and stop playing until it's either fixed or some other game can step up and fill the void that D3 left.  

I just find it perplexing that I see so many people complain about it so much yet continue to play it.

So I'm a fairly casual gamer. Probably the last time I was super serious about a game was D2. So of course I decided when D3 was announced that I would put my real adult life on hold as much as possible and take D3 as seriously as I took its predecessor.

I got the game. Started playing. Loved it. Felt a little lost. So naturally I went to the interwebz to start drawing on resources. I found a TON here (thank you) and I found a FEW on the Blizzard forums. But mostly on the Blizzard forums (and to some lesser degree

My problem is that I have to wade through that complaining to find the stuff I want to read to get better at the game. And when the complaining greatly outweighs everything else

Now I find I'm enjoying the game less. Not because my wizard's DPS got nerfed yesterday. Honestly if I hadn't been reading all the nerd rage on the Blizzard forums about it I probably would have barely noticed

I'm enjoying the game less because... well

I'm not saying the game's perfect. I'm not saying it's better or worse than D2. I'm not saying it's just a WoW rehash because I never played WoW and frankly couldn't care less. I'm actually not here to offer a professional critique of the game like anyone gives a shit about what I have to say. 

I'm a casual gamer who wants to have fun and maybe dabble in advancing to the next skill level. But whenever I dip my toes in the world of more advanced players for some tips and tricks

My takeaway: if you're just an average player who wants to learn more about game mechanics, and run. If totally immersing myself in the world of the hardcore gamers who posture as authorities on games like this means I end up being miserable about this nerf and that nerf and either feel like I need to quit, or write an angry/weepy open letter to Blizzard, or feel quietly guilty for still enjoying the game...

I'm sorry if you made 300k an hour by clicking on pots and now you have to actually play the game. I know this will probably get a lot of flack from people because of the fact that it's your game and you can play it how you like it. However I think this was a good change for blizzard to make because not only does it help the economy by stopping some bots and decreasing ease of gold farming but it also makes people actually have to play the game instead of just constantly searching for ways to abuse it.

Disclaimer: English is my native language but I'm pretty drunk so yeah.

The longer version: I have played a fair bit of D3, 125 intel, a little bit of vit.  I did an AH search for a source with intel and crit % to boost my damage.  I set the max buyout at 10 mil,(which is pretty optimistic because I made a bad judgment call on an attempted flip and am under 1M in cash atm).  But guess what? With one exception, every item on the first page was vendor TRASH.  All these kids playing their demon hunters pull a rare source off some garbage mob and roll it with intel so they think it's godly.  But none of them realize that it's WORTHLESS without the +dmg mod.

Early on I decided I wanted to go 1h/Source instead of 2h.  I actually shelled out for a 2h axe with 1400 dps but I sold it back because I hated the look of my wizard with a 2h axe - terrible flavor, figuring I could make it up with a source with mods.  UNFORTUNATELY, I am unable to sort AH search results by damage.  This is total bullshit.  ~~Any monk can sort his fists/daibos by damage.  Any barb can sort his swords by dps.  Any DH can sort his quivers my attackspeed, dex, discipline, any mod you like.~~  (edit: Someone has kindly pointed out that, for instance, attributes which are the actual defining characteristic of their respective items.  My only response: Blizzard

This is further exacerbated by the fact that when blizzard first announced they were going to boost crafting, I was a wizard and thought it would be cool to buy the 6 prop orbit stones plan.  Guess what?  The plan is worthless, because even if I happen to craft a sweet source, I can't post it because it will just be buried under the mountains of garbage currently inhabiting the AH source market.

What a disaster! you think.  How sad! you exclaim.  How could we ever fix this? you despair.  But no! I say.  There is a fix.  LET ME SEARCH FOR THE MODIFIER +DMG.  LET ME SORT RESULTS BY DMG ADDED.  LET ME IGNORE ALL THE IDIOTS WHO HAVE NEVER PLAYED A WIZARD AND HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHEN THEY POST A WIZARD SOURCE.

Also any WDs who have the same problem (My WD is only level 30 and I haven't searched for mojos but I'm sure y'all have the same problem) please chime in!  This should be such a simple fix but it would make such a big difference to so many of us.

**Here's some things you should know:**


 Kripp


Bashiok has addressed the community staying there was no hotfix to fix this. They are investigating. [link](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/5760137425?page=3#51) 
Many players however have stated that there has been a general chat hotfix tonight allowing the game to remember


The Auction House has had some weird items for extremely high prices. Some people cite this as evidence for gold duplication.


Here is one supposed method of how the item duplication worked:

* Bid 200k (random value) on item A.
* Roll your clock back.
* Your gold resets to what it was.
* Bid stays.
* You outbid yourself on item A.
* You receive your 200k gold from getting outbid.
* You now made 200k gold out of nowhere.

Three **theories** as to what happened/is happening:


1. Kripp creates controversy to gain streamers and ad revenue.

2. Trolls.

3. Blizzard has actually messed up and is doing damage control.


The photo with 100+ billion gold is **believed to be photoshop**. I believe it was meant as a joke in response to the photo of 4 billion gold. however people are now using this incorrectly as evidence. http://i.imgur.com/gucjP.jpg


There IS video of item duplication as well as an inordinate amount of gold on **Asian** Servers. They were not rolled back


Things I think you should keep in mind:

* Blizzard can see people's gold. People who've done this will be easy to spot.
* Everything upsetting you is on the premise that there IS gold duplication. Wait for proof before your jimmies get rustled.
* Blizzard noticed bugs on the Asian servers immediately maintenance'd them. Wouldn't they do the same to us?
* Has there ever been a time you've received gold late or had missing gold only to have it return later?
* There is something fishy going on and it's too early to pass judgement.

Please share any information you can on this topic as I'm sure we're all dying to know if this is something to be concerned about.

1351530680.0,12a8gd,"A party passive slot, simple incentive to make people play together.",cdxliv,651,143,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/12a8gd/a_party_passive_slot_simple_incentive_to_make/



I think I have found a pretty simple solution to the problem. Have a fourth passive slot for each character that is only active when they are in a party and not solo. The passives would be class specific and should probably be limited to 4-5 for each class. Their properties should be similar to follower passive skills. each class should have a skill to increase attack, resource regen and a special class characteristic passive.


**Examples of class specific passive**


* Barb Group Passive. *Can't Hold Us Down*  When WOTB is activated

* Monk Group Passive. *Float like a butterfly* When group member is within 6 yard of you

* Demon Hunter Group Passive. *Hawkeye* When in a party

* Wizard Group Passive. *Power Overwhelming* Chance to fill every party members resource to full and keep it there for 5 seconds. Can happen once per minute. 

* Witch Doctor Group Passive. *Vodoo First Aid* When a party member is below 20% health your pets will be drained of their HP to replenish the party member to 50% health


These are just some ideas, group armor, group pick up radius, group resource regen and group mf boost. I think with this fourth passive slot, people will be more inclined to party up, it might just be 4 people all running +MF passive, but it will still get people to play together. Having 5 group passives for each class will mean that players need to communicate and balance their skill with one another. These passive should not be very powerful but still provide a noticeable difference from solo play.

**Cemetery of the Forsaken Zippy Elite Hunting.** Your goal is to go to each crypt, proceed to next crypt.

Resist the temptation to look for that 2nd _possible_ crypts elite. Why? Each crypt has almost always 1 elite in it. Shaves a lot from your key farming time!

* 3-4 elites at the Cave of the Moon Clan (in Highlands Crossing) + 1 Resplendent Chest
* 3-5 elites at Festering Woods

I was a starving college student and it was definitely better than getting a job at the local burger joint.

I would meet many of my customers in game to personally hand them the items so I had the chance to ask them why they would spend $10 on a virtual axe. It was just as crazy to me back then as it is to some of you Diablo players. 

**Every customer I chatted with was an adult with a high paying job (doctors, it's as simple as that. They didn't care about fair play, they didn't care about if it was ""wrong"", they just wanted to have fun for the hour or 2 they had in their day to play the game.

The **only** concern I have about the RMAH is PvP. PvP has the potential to add HUGE replay value to D3 (just like arena's in WoW). If players can simply one shot players by spending more money then we'll have serious issues.

YET all the options you have for finding a group is joining A QUEST. There is no lobby, Guild Wars


I'm not a big community-member


A game like Diablo 3 is in my opinion not designed to spend a lot of time for doing the quests. The long term goal is farming. As in Diablo 2, which rewarded you with items you can only get from these bosses. Although you didn't really care about doing the quests in Diablo 2, you actually DID care, since some of them rewarded you with skill points and stat boni - something it was worth for doing them.


In Diablo 3


And yet, and you're right with his. I could just join any game and do my farming, because I would still get exp and and I would still find items. But if you develop a game, I think you design the game options for a specific purpose and you try to include options which support this purpose in the best possible way. When I look at this party/quest system, I have the feeling that blizzard did the exact opposite. The thing you want to do the least in Diablo 3 (talking about late game) are the quests, yet it's all about joining a specific quest.


There is no game lobby as in D2, there is just NOTHING. It's 2012, over 10 years after D2 release, blizzard is offering online-only playing and the WHOLE multiplayer content consists of a friends list, an auction house, a crippled chat and the option to join A QUEST.

My friends thought that people would be interested in asking me a few things

One of my favorite parts of gaming has been the economics of the item markets since I started trading in Neopets ten years ago. It is what first got me interested in economics, hit me up!)

There are a lot of misconceptions about the markets in a game like this, because the one thing I'm not going to disclose is the specific items I have bought and sold, and a few specifics about my techniques and trade secrets, simply because it's part of what makes me successful :P I will try to answer most things, though.

Some proof:

[Some recent paypal transactions](http://i.imgur.com/Zc4A6.png)

(The one transaction that is blurred is a gold sale directly to a person. I have a few regulars still from months ago that I occasionally sell to. These days



Some corresponding sales on the RMAH:

Some of the trading on the GAH:

http://imgur.com/YisJk.png

I have never botted, or cheated in any way whatsoever. Before this game, I never made any money off of what I did because it was against the rules. Investing and trading in the item markets is part of how I have my fun, it wouldn't make sense for me to cheat. Anyone who played D2 with hacks knows what I mean.

Hi there /r/diablo3 ! I will be streaming today starting around 11:00am EST until 11:00am EST tomorrow morning in order to help raise money to get my brother the medical help he needs. For the past 15 years my brother has dealt with two serious mental health illnesses. When he was around 15 he was diagnosed with both Bi-Polar disorder and Schizophrenia. He has struggled every day since then to find the right dose of medicine to help him.

Due to the combination of these illnesses it is very difficult for him to keep taking his medication on a regular schedule. The more time he spends alone away from people and without a job, however, have not been kind to him.

After struggling with illness for so long, stuffing, and pies but it still really sucked for him and for us).

Today my mother made me aware of an outpatient program that could do wonders to get him back on his feet. He would have multiple group therapy sessions a week, the program is not covered by insurance whatsoever and the cost is $1,700 per month. His main therapis, who he has been working with for over 15 years, believes that just 2 months of the program would be enough for him., which means we need to find $3,200 dollars to pay for it.

I'll be honest Reddit

I will be answering any questions throughtout my stream about Monks

I *had* a Dial-In Authenticator, I will list the instructions to opt out of the Dial-In Authenticator, and switch to the Mobile App Authenticator.

1. Log in to battle.net
2. Go to Account
3. Locate the option to opt out of the Dial-In Authenticator
4. Dial the number (with the phone you bound your account to)
5. Follow the voice instructions.
6. Verify the opt-out
7. Load Play Store or the Apple Store(?) and download Battle.Net Authenticator.
8. Choose to secure your account with the Mobile App Authenticator on your browser.
9. Enter the Serial Code
10. CHECKBOX the ""Require an authenticator code every time you log in to the game"" option.

1343432240.0,x9vjv,Inferno completed with all 5 classes without any farming - my opinions on the relative strengths of each class,snakebehindme,688,220,153,"(Edit: If you want proof of my Inferno completion achievements

After 350 hours of play, I could never amass much money with this strategy, but I was generally able to stay within the 500k-1m gold range, and I never went completely broke.

Anyway, and I describe each class's strengths and weaknesses. I also give my final stats (unbuffed) for each one after finishing Inferno, so you can get a general sense for the kind of gear I could get without farming.

Note: When referring to a class's strength

* 1. **Monk** - I was actually really surprised at how good monks are. It was the second-to-last class I played

*Strengths*: Amazing mobility with Thunderclap, and I never had to upgrade anything after that. Progression was extremely smooth and enjoyable. The only elite packs I ever had to skip were the bullshit Morlu Incinerator guys in Act 4 (LOL every time you touch me I'm gonna teleport off screen so you're guaranteed to hit the enrage timer!)

*Weaknesses*: Not much. Ghom was the only boss that took me a little while to figure out

Final Stats: 16k dps, 29k hp, 800 LoH

* 2. **Barb** - Apparently melee is the way to go now, because I used the Berserker Rage passive with no fury-spending ability.

*Strengths*: Between the strength primary stat, barbs get a ridiculous amount of armor. This means that you can pretty much ignore resistances and still be fine. The only time I ever cared about resistance was for Ghom - I bought some cheap poison resist gear for about 300k total to get it up to 800 post-warcry, popped on the Relentless passive (which pretty much hard counters Ghom), and proceeded to face-tank him to death (he doesn't even spawn adds if you never leave melee range!) The Ghom fight is definitely a strength of the class, as every other class required kiting.

*Weaknesses*: Those cleavery skeleton guys in the Breached Keep that do a bajillion damage. Fuck them. At least with my monk, I can't really think of any other significant weaknesses; all of the bosses were relatively simple. I mean, Morlu Incinerator elites were as impossible as ever, but that's kinda true for every class (ranged have a little less trouble with them, but they're still super obnoxious).

Final Stats: 17k dps, 47k hp, 900 LoH

* 3. **Wizard** - Pretty well-designed/balanced class overall. Force armor is kind of a crutch

*Strengths*: Wizards are great at trash mobs and elite/champion packs. You can kite stuff forever with blizzard while venom hydra does all the work. And force armor saves you if run into a little trouble with the kiting (unlike most save-me abilities

*Weaknesses*: Bosses, because I could stand in melee range. But when you need to stay out of melee range, the kiting becomes far more difficult since he spawns new clouds on top of you (so these new clouds won't overlap with the previous ones). Ultimately, I decided my kiting was just barely not good enough, so I went to the AH and got cheap poison resist gear to get 1000 resist (with prismatic armor buff). Then, after kiting Ghom around the room, I was able to stand in a cloud for a good 5-10 seconds while waiting for it to disappear. As for Cydaea, that fight was just super obnoxious. The spiders should really not auto-hit you if the pool happens to spawn on top of you

Final Stats: 27k dps, 40k hp, 800 life/sec

* 4. **Demon Hunter** - Disclaimer: my opinions regarding the Demon Hunter class are kind of irrelevant at this point in time. This is because I did everything up to Inferno Diablo before the Nether Tentacles nerf. I killed Diablo himself post-nerf (I actually reached Diablo 15 minutes before the servers went down for the patch). Also, and I had to learn all of the boss fights. With that disclaimer in mind, I found the class to be pretty strong, but also frustrating to play. It's completely dependent on smoke screen, which means that any time you're about to die, you have to see it coming ahead of time so that you can activate the ability. Maybe the class plays differently when it's less of a glass cannon, but it seems impossible to get to that point with cheap gear.

*Strengths*: Trash mobs and elite/champion packs were very easy. Just smoke screen anything that's scary, so I don't really know how it works now (haven't touched my demon hunter after killing Diablo, so I literally have 0 experience killing trash mobs without NT).

*Weaknesses*: Rakanoth (probably Ghom and Cydaea, and Rakanoth wasn't touched. A tip for game developers: never, ever give a boss an unpredictable ability that unavoidably one-shots the player. The fight was fine as a wizard because force armor makes the teleport ability survivable. As a demon hunter, you have to pre-smoke screen it. Since the teleport initially looks basically the same as his other two abilities (shoot swirly things and spawn soul lashers), you have to pre-smoke screen all of his abilities. This means you'll run out of discipline and die. I kept dying over and over to Rakanoth, until one attempt when the 30% Preparation rune proc'd twice (giving me 3 full bars of discipline), and I happened to dodge his teleport attack once after I ran out of discipline. So when I killed him, since I'm pretty sure a demon hunter can never reasonably get to the point where the teleport ability won't one-shot (I had 36k hp and the attack did 75-80k damage). All that being said

Final Stats: 26k dps, 36k hp, 200 life/sec, 49 max disc

It's been a long road and you've all been incredible. I've received hundreds of emails containing bugs

So to start everything off

THANK YOU
---

Thank you for being so passionate about the game

The goals of D3Up.com V1.0
---
The entire goal of this update was two-fold:

- Make D3Up.com a lot easier to use and gather information from.
- Rebuild all of the Tools so they can be used in many

I think I've accomplished both of these goals (hopefully)

What is [D3Up.com](http://d3up.com)?
---
If you've been to the site

[D3Up.com](http://d3up.com) is a 'Build Calculator', finding upgrades and learning the inner workings of your character.

[D3Up.com](http://d3up.com) is designed to assist you with the following:

- EHP Calculations
- DPS Calculations
- Individual Skill DPS Calculations
- Gear Comparisons
- Simuating changes on your Items
- Creating Snapshots of your Build
- Individual EHP/DPS Contributions by Gear
- EHP/DPS Gains per Stat
- Many more statistics you might need!

Interested in a Video showing how to use the new site?
---
I took some time and did a video showing off the new D3Up.com, but pretty much covers everything and if people find it useful, I can make more. 

I figure it's also a great tool for showing people how exactly to use a build calculator to explore their character in-depth! I see a TON of ""What should I upgrade next..."" posts, they can just figure it out themselves!

[D3Up.com - Introduction Video (16m)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaRts-nmOE8)

So

Version 1.0 Changes
---

**General Updates**

- D3Up.com has been completely redesigned from the ground up. 
- The navigation has been updated to a new
- For non-registered users
- For logged-in users
- I've attempted to simplify the entire site and categories each section to fall under one of the links in the Mega Menu: Builds
- The ""Items DB"" will be slowly phasing out
- A link to our Facebook page has been added to the Menu
- The homepage has been streamlined slightly and will be a bit more flexible in the future. I realize most people use the site for their own personal builds and not as a site to browse

**Build Browsing**

- An 'Advanced Search' button has been added to the builds page that lets you search for builds that use a specific combination of Skills and Passives.

**Your Build/Character Updates**

- The Build Interface has been completely redesigned into a 3-column layout. They are as follows: Left - Controls
- The Gear panel now has 3 different modes: DPS/EHP Contributions
- *DPS/EHP Contributions*: Lists the contributions to DPS and EHP that each individual piece of gear provides your Build.
- *Gear Stats/Perfection*: Shows every individual stat on each item
- *Change/Compare/Simulate Gear*: Lets you compare/simulate changes on multiple items at the same time
- You can now Simulate an item change AND do item comparisons at the same time
- You can now activate/deactivate skills
- You can click on the icons in your build header to activate/deactivate skills.
- The Skills panel now also shows 'meta' information
- Companion Abilities and Shrines have been added as buffs you can now 'Activate'.
- A new panel called 'Battle.net Sync' has been added to all builds allowing for quick and painless updates to your character.
- The edit page has been moved and is now part of the Build itself.
- A link to ""My Items"" has been added onto your build

**My Items**

- The interface has been redesigned to make it a bit easier to look around. You can filter by stats and they will appear on the page as you specify them.
- You can now delete ALL items with the 'Delete All Items' button at the top. There's a confirmation page that makes you confirm this decision. 
- You can now select multiple items with the checkbox next to their name to delete multiple items at once. 
- Deleting items will NOT remove them from your builds
- When you hover over an item row
- Clicking the 'Sell' button on an item will currently load it up into the 'My Shop' feature for price tracking. 
- Items are sorted by newest first

**My Shop**

- Major changes are coming to this section at some point after 1.0.5

Final Thoughts
---
I'm devoted to making D3Up.com the ultimate tool for your Diablo 3 Characters, there probably are going to be a few new bugs that pop-up over the next couple days that I just didn't catch, PLEASE report them to me, I'll fix them ASAP. Respond here, email me (aaron.cox@greymass.com) or reach out to me somehow.

I've got a few changes that didn't make this version that I'll be working on soon. I plan on taking a break from the site and doing feature development only for a couple weeks after 1.0.5 is released

http://youtu.be/DBQSy0eP8u8

There are really only 3 builds you need access to: Poison Darts (for only some bosses)

My credentials? I’ve solo’d inferno all the way up to A4, mostly farmed in Act 4 inferno. I have a 188% MF gearset that can kill elite packs in Act 4 inferno, because of a tight spec, and solid tight play that hopefully this guide will teach you.

**Here are the three specs you need:**

(Sorry for format

1) Dire bats, and unlike poison darts, Dire bats is aoe, which is absolutely crucial. Rest of the spec is up to you, but I use: Spirit Walk (with 3 sec rune), BBV (with either 20% dmg or mana rune), Soul Harvest (with either 60 sec rune, or healing rune), Dire bats.

Passives are Vision Quest (naturally)

2) Zombie Bears, Fast. You aren’t kiting that pack, so you have to just zombie bears blitz it. 

Typically I will use Mass Confusion instead of Grasp. If I have widdled down to only 1 unit remaining, replacing soul harvest (if only 1 mob to soul harvest).

**PROTIP:** If you back yourself into a corner

3) Poison Dart build, since you NEED aoe dmg and the slow is insane. Anything else is up to you, but you'll prob use BBV for bursting single targets, and fetish army, because it's just stupidly strong.

**Gear**

Most people say the best setup for Dire bats or Zombie Bears is a slow 2her, since it doesn’t scale well with slow attack speed. 

However, you actually get more dps out of a fast 1her, high dmg offhand, and high dmg/ias rings/amulets. I went from around 49k dps to almost 70k dps by switching. The tradeoff you have to make is to change your BBV into the mana regen BBV rune, but when you do, my God you kill things fast. I had a 4.5 second butcher kill, a 5 second Rakanoth kill, this is the ONLY way to kill them. 

Most of inferno is gimmacky like this. You have to fight these 5 second burst dmg fights with zero hp and rely on your spirit walk and spirit vessel to let you dps as a glass cannon while being invulnerable. Unfortunately, but 70k dps and just literally never get hit.

The other good thing about doing the switch to 1hers is that you can run the poison dart build with the same gear.  For direbats grinding, with some mana regen on your 1her you can regen mana really fast with Vision Quest active.


**Must-Have Skills - a brief discussion on why I choose what I choose

Spirit Walk: Obviously you absolutely must have this in inferno to stand a chance. This is one of the reasons I believe that the Witch Doctor is the best inferno class right now. I used to run the life regen rune, 100% need to be using the 3 second rune. This is a 50% increase in INVULNERABLE DPS TIME, and I can't even begin to give it credit. Just take it, you'll thank me.  

Vessel: I shouldn't have to say why this is manatory, or you are doing it wrong. Inferno is all about these 3-5 second burst dps encounters, and this passive is absolutely required to survive past act 2 and actually get stuff dead. Unfortunately, most content requires you to just blitz it down while you are invulnerable with this because you just got 1-shot, then following it up with a 3 sec invulnerable spirit walk. Hopefully the monster died while you were dishing out 70k dps in this 3-5 second timeframe.

BBV/Fetish Army: These aren't must-have per se

Grasp with 80% slow: This abilitly is so important in almost every build. Not only is the slow important for keeping stuff off you, zombie bears, whatever hit EVERYTHING. It saves your life and increases your dps by ensuring your AOE hits more stuff.

Soul Harvest: This is a great spell for taking down elite packs

Zombie Bears: This spell is literally the only reason why witch doctors can take down some elite packs in A4 inferno. Some bosses like Rakanoth are just impossible to beat any other way.



**GEARING**

For gearing

**One Handed Weapon:**

#1) Fast Attack Speed. You NEED this to be at least 1.74
#2) Mana regen. This helps a ton when you are spamming 2-3 dire bears every second.

**Offhand:**

#1) Offhand has to have at least +240 avg dmg (i.e. +80-400, so you NEED this to be high.

After getting enough +dmg (say +89-400), and int (see stat guide below for details on what proportions).

**Rings/Amulet/Gloves**

You need to get attack speed here, focus on +dmg, int, crit, crit bonus dmg.

**Chest/Boots/Legs/Belt**

As much int as you can get. If you can get crit and crit dmg bonus

**Hat**

Mana regen is a must

**Important note: buggy IAS on non-ias slots**

Currently if you have IAS on a belt, or anywhere that doesn't naturally have access to IaS, it actually will NOT work. 


**Stat Guide - Stat valuations:**

General dps values are as follows

1 int = 1 int

1% Ias = roughly 12 int

1% crit = roughly 8 int

+1dmg = roughly 2.5 int

1 vit = WORTHLESS. 

HP is literally zero value in inferno, vitality is absolutely zero value. At all. Zero.

Notice how I say ""roughly"" everywhere? This is because these equivalencies are dynamic, character stats: 1900 int, 50% crit bonus (i.e. base), 60% ias on ringes/ammy/gloves). 

If you stack a bunch of +crit dmg bonus, the value of each int past that gets lower and lower, and the value of the other things, +dmg, ias, etc, gets higher and higher. These numbers should give you general guidelines to follow though.


**PROTIP: how to get your exact values:**

The best way to check for yourself is to go to the AH, one with +1 damage, one with +1% crit, and one with +1 vit (or whatever, use this as your baseline). Then you can equip the ""zero ring"" (i.e. the vit ring) and then hover over each other ring and find the equivalent dps values for each stat, and figure out your own stat valuations.

Okay

In Diablo 3, and I present those results below:

Some people have claimed Diablo 3 only uses your DPS to calculate skill damage. That is false.

I compared a very quick dagger to a slow 2H hammer with nearly the same DPS. Despite having the same DPS

I used a dagger (46.5 dps

I tried a variety of spells, and Ray of Frost. (10 full casts of Blizzard per weapon, measured before/after enemy HP values with the HP overlay.)

With the 2h hammer

With the dagger

(Deviation was small

Arcane Orb did more damage per cast with the hammer. Not sometimes; *every time*. I also tried with/without ~+30% IAS. *The +%Attack Speed gear made no difference on the damage per orb.*

However

Conclusion: Technically speaking, you can only afford to cast it ~3 times in a row, and the total damage of those 3 casts will be much higher with the hammer. However, the casting animation will be slower.

Note: I did no experiments on cooldown skills. It is possible that cooldown damage uses DPS instead of raw damage. I have no data on this at present.

Some skills will work better with fast weapons, or a Fury Generator), then a quick dagger will work best. If you are favoring an expensive spell, like Arcane Orb (or a Fury Spender), then you want as much punch as possible per use, and you should focus on max damage-per-hit.

It can be a lot easier to get your DPS up by acquiring +%Attack Speed gear, rather than wasting DPS on overkill, so if you don't need the extra punch of a slow weapon, you should look for speed.",,False,self,1337743682.0,t3_tznjx

First off

Losing your stacks for gear swapping punishes good play. Suppose you're playing a barb wielding a 2H weapon, when you run into a champion pack of those freaking wasp assholes. The affixes don't look so tough, but they do amazing amounts of damage by default. Under the current system, you aren't penalized for switching to a 1H+shield combo, or maybe switching out your Str+a bit of vit and resi all chest for a chest that gives you less DPS, but a lot more survivability. If you lose stacks on gear swap, though, or to skip the pack despite it being very much killable if only you could switch out your gear without being arbitrarily punished. I don't think there's anything wrong with carrying a few pieces of gear to help through tough situations but not to use in general play; removing a stack on gear swap would punish something that doesn't seem remotely exploitative.

Here's another example. You're a DH, 800 life on hit, +80% crit damage, three sockets, +200 resist all, kittens jump out of your monitor and cuddle with you whenever you shoot it, the works. That truly amazing bow... proceeds to sit in your stash until the run is over, and then realizing that you can't equip it right away because the game punishes you for doing so

Next up, which is good, because gear swapping sucks. But I think some of them don't really grasp why it sucks. There's nothing wrong with twinking a bit to get better loot. The problem with gear swapping is that it is *tedious and unfun*, and even the people who do it agree with this. Gear swapping would be perfectly okay if it wasn't such a giant pain in the ass to do, slowing down play and generally being annoying.

And that brings me to my first possible solution: a gear swap button. You have two gear loadouts in your inventory

Personally, and then give Nephalem Valor a comprehensive rework. Have it apply at all levels, through all difficulties. Change the number of stacks you can have, and how much MF and GF each stack grants, and adjust the secondary rewards (like the current guaranteed rare from elites and two rares from bosses).

And because it is rather large

Because of the seemingly lacking wikis and already outdated, hopefully also providing you with some guidelines on how to deal with them.

As a disclaimer, since I have two level 60 Wizards (don't ask). (ok, if you're really curious, I've answered a couple of times in the thread already)

Now that I'm re-reading through it

---------------------------
Now then

Monster affixes are certain attributes that any special monster pack may possess. These abilities are piled upon the already existing inherent abilities of the monster along with a healthy HP boost.

--------------------------

There are two kinds of special monster packs:

1. **Rares (Elites):** They appear with a yellow glowy model that is much larger than standard and have various minion monsters around them. They have the highest HP boost of all the special types (affixes not included) while the minions have the least. The Rare monster's minions do not have to be the same type as he is. You may find a caster cultist type Rare with hellion minions

2. **Champions:** They typically appear as 3-4 equally strong mobs with a blue glowy, and have certain abilities that gives them a team-worky vibe. Killing one of the group will diminish their killing power immensely, giving you ample reason to single them out and try to separate them. Many champion only affixes will only work if the champions are within range of each other, hence why it is a viable tactic to separate them.

There is a third kind of monster: The Unique monster. These monsters do not clearly show their affixes

There are 25 monster affixes that may appear on a monster pack. Of these, in nightmare 2 affixes, in hell you'll get 3, and finally, in inferno mode, you'll always get 4 affixes on a pack. 

Not all of the 25 affixes can affect both types of monsters. Some are champion-specific

-------------------------------
Here are the 25:

* **Arcane Enchanted:**

Arcane Enchanted mobs are easily recognizable by the purple orbs they create ocassionally. These orbs will activate after a few seconds sending a beam in a random direction (the beam appears instantly when it activates), they do arcane damage and are resistant to arcane damage, but that doesn't actually affect the incoming damage very much for some reason.

It is a good idea to move well away of an orb when you see it, and it does enough damage that it is always worth getting out of its way, even as a tanky melee. Because of their random direction rotation behaviour, some orbs may create scissoring beams in situations where you cannot get out of the way effectively.

In the case where you have to go through a beam, so the less contact you have with the beam, the better. This goes without saying, but don't touch the orb itself.

*Note:* The affix ""Enchanted"" does not

* **Avenger:**

Avengers (not to be confused with THE avengers) can only be champion packs. As each member of the pack dies, and can often seem quite intimidating (even quill rats seem scary when it's as large as an unburied). 

Note: The champions who get the avenger buff also glow with some kind of inner fire.

The best way to deal with this affix is to try to deal as much damage as possible to all the members of the pack in question before taking them down. The extra damage gained from the buff is substantial, as they will pack a wallop. 

At least there is a bright side to this, the impact made will mean, quite literally, the mob's innevitable defeat. In other words, the bigger they are, the harder they fall.

*dan_au: A note on the Avenger affix - it does fade away after some time*

* **Desecrator:**

Desecrator mobs, giving you a good window of opportunity to move out of the way. When active, the pools of poop hurt like a frenzied kitten you grabbed by the tail. You can see you're actually sitting in the void zone because a skull debuff icon appears next to your resource globe.

Dealing with this kind of packs is again a question of positioning. Minions cast desecration too, so keep your hand on that escape skill hotkey. 

The damage done by the pools themselves is physical

* **Electrified:**

Electrified mobs are recognizable by being the less scary cousin of the MSLE mobs from D2 LoD. Hitting one of these mobs will shoot charged bolts in random directions around the mob itself, simply because it only means you take some additional damage while attacking the mob.

The damage is not spiky

There is a nasty situation you do not really want electrified in

* **Extra Health:**

Extra Health have 50% more health than is usual for an elite/champion pack. That means they take about 50% longer to kill. According to meme sites they're a bit more than Russian.

This can prove a pain to deal with for tanky builds in inferno because you have to whittle away at it 50% more, like shielding and invulnerable minions. Add to that the fact that the mob in question may be one with high base health, like an unburied, with an inherent knockback or shield (like the corrupted angels) and you get a pack you'd rather not fight.

Because it's such a boring affix,False,self,t5_2qore,1338407782.0,secrettome,tyrael idscroll challenge one,t3_uaqv7

1346017361.0,yvckd,Was Diablo 2 REALLY that perfect?,killswitch1968,915,485,502,"I wanted to post this before 1.04 came out, but I want to remind people it had some seriously stupid stuff in it you may have forgot.

1. You had a stash but it was HALF the size of ONE page of our current stash. Yes

2. Obviously this meant no shared stash between characters. If you wanted to transfer something you had to either get a friend or do a very risky game transfer - Create a game

3. Imagine in Diablo 3 every time you died you lost 20% of all of your gold. Just instantly gone. Any gold you picked up since being in town was 100% gone unless you could get to your body again. This meant gold was completely unreliable as a method of storing wealth
In later levels you'd also lose 20% of whatever Paragon level you were grinding. Awesome.
4. The need to store gear was exacerbated by the lack of a common currency (see point 3). All kinds of different units were used to price out items - SoJs, PGems, there are pages and pages of forum posts intricately detailing the market rate of various items because gold had no value. It was a mess.

5. Imagine in Diablo 3 if you died you were LITERALLY naked until you could locate your corpse and get your gear back

6. ""Hit Recovery"" was an actual affix on an item. If a mob hit you hard enough it did a kind of 'mini' stun where you couldn't walk or attack

7. You think pubs are bad in Diablo 3? In D2 there was no independent drops. The only thing that was equitably shared was the most worthless thing in the game, EVERYONE had a tiny bit of lag as soon as the boss died. Even people on powerful computers had this and it was frustrating as hell to kill this boss then not even SEE the loot fly out because by the time you're resynced some guy has already collected everything.

8. No authenticators.

9. Let's talk about the ""Stamina meter"". In Diablo 2 you could Run or Walk. Guess how popular ""walking"" was. But it's not that simple. After running for a certain time your character 'got tired' and you became FORCED to walk until you 'recover' your stamina. They even put in an entire stamina shrines that let you run as much as you wanted till it ran out. A whole shrine just so you don't have to watch your character limp along the battlefield.

10. Ya Phase beasts suck, and explode EVEN IF YOU KILL THEM. D2 had that. Now imagine Act 2 Constructs, but double their range allowing them to attack off screen, and have them to whiz around the map and have that stun effect as mentioned in point 6. Oh and the attack penetrates through multiple people. There was nothing funnier than watching an entire 6 man party zone into the final area and see nothing but ""Player was killed by Black Soul!"" ""Player was killed by Black Soul!"" ""Player was killed by Black Soul!"" ""Player was killed by Black Soul!""

11. Your resistances capped out at 75% unless you had these really expensive legendaries that let you go beyond that. And having max resist just let you survive those same Black Souls an extra second longer before dying.

12. People seem to love that you could level up your own dex, and int. In principle it sounds neat, but literally every build recommended the following: ""Put all your points into vitality except what's required to wear this recommended gear."" Diablo 2 didn't have level requirements for gear, it required you had certain stat thresholds. Just to be dicks Blizzard created an item called ""Wizardspike"" and then required you dump like 25 points into dexterity to use it as a wizard.

13. No respeccing. Have fun when a patch botches your character. Just to screw over people who were new to the game, one wrong click and you were stuck with it.

14. You had followers in Diablo 2 that had the same archetypes as D3,000 gold to resurrect them. They were at least as brainless as the current followers.

15. Unsocketing items was a laborious and expensive procedure. Gems only went up to 'perfect'. They later released ""runes"" (completely different than D3 runes) which are more similar to the current gem system now

16. Most items took up 3 grid squares in your inventory. A lot were up to 6

17. Diablo 2 had a RMAH too

18. Because there was no auction house

19. When Diablo 2 first came out

20. Gems/Runes didn't stack. You can imagine how ridiculous point 1 gets.

21. You had no innate town portal ability. You had to find a stupid scroll and use that to go back to town. The drops were frequent but it didn't change the fact that if you forgot to buy them or they didn't drop you were stuck. The only nice thing was that it was instant cast.

22. You had no innate ability to identify items except for finding these scolls like in point 21. That said

23. Combining gems was far worse in Diablo 2. Each gem had to be individually selected, take it out, and select 3 other gems to repeat the process. The only good thing was that it was free, but just a royal pain in the ass.

24. 2 words: Maggot Lair. Imagine a 3 level dungeon with corridors that can fit no more than one person with no clipping allowed. Now fill that dungeon with monsters that can replicate

25. Act 2 had a final Boss that had an 'aura of freeze'

26. There was a mob in Act 4 that could cast thorns. This spell reflected something like 500% damage

27. The PVP system in Diablo 2 everyone pines for was basically you clicking on a little button in the party window that turned on friendly fire. There wasn't any arenas, where friendly fire was ALWAYS on, and if a monster killed you you dropped ALL YOUR GEAR. It was almost a blessing you could hack your entire character and get whatever gear you wanted.

28. MF switching, Scammers, Griefers, ya, that all existed in 1999, don't worry.

29. You know how molten enemies explode in Diablo 3 on death after a few seconds? Well

30. Potions didn't stack. You had 4 slots for potions and that was it. Wearing certain belts would increase the number of potions per slot to up to 4

1342991776.0,wzd1b,Compiled List of End-Game Ideas,bravetarget,542,119,98,"This is a compiled list of ideas (focused on level 60) that the community has thought of and discussed a lot over the last couple months.  Trust me

**1.) Endless Dungeon**


*This one is pretty self-explanatory, this is to prevent someone who can easily handle any level 63 situation to not just endlessly go deeper (See Idea #7 for added difficulty).  A higher mLvl should also give higher drop rates of iLvl 63.  Additionally, each level should be small but still very random.*



**2.) Defense Mode**


*Not just a special event located somewhere



**3.) Expand on Crafting**



*With the current crafting system you're just turning useless blues/rares into more (mostly)useless rares.  It's a very black &amp; white system and has absolutely no depth to it.  In Diablo 2 (sorry for referencing old games) they had the horadric cube which contained tons of random recipes that you could transmute with it.  Not only that


*There needs to be more recipes that work similar to the staff of herding. Make account bound materials that you have to find


**4.) A Rewarding Item Hunt with more Legendaries**



*It's clear the reward for time invested into item hunting is verrrry low.  Not only are you feeling very unrewarded

*There are numerous ways to fix this without throwing off the balance of things.  For instance, when a player does find a legendary item, the bonus % resets back to 0.  This would not only reward you for playing in both long and short sessions, but also make wiping out huge waves of trash mobs actually mean something.  You would log out of Diablo 3 knowing that the next time you log on, you actually have a better chance at finding a special item than before.  Additionally, they could make it so every 250,000XP gives you a NV stack and then we can utilize the big empty XP bar at lvl 60 to track some sort of progress.*



**5.) Free Roam Mode**


*I'm not exactly sure why this wasn't included in the release build, but a possible fix is to just have the host select which boss they are on and players can join based on the current boss selected.*



**6.) Hardcore Duels (Spectating/Betting)**



*I realize PvP may not be out for some time, and join it.  There could even be gold bets that players can make while the prep period is in session.  In order to keep from fixing the fights, the fighters should be matched up to anonymous competitors in a queue.*


*I mean, then place 10 million gold on the Wizard after inspecting each players gear.  Once the fight starts, everyones blood is pumping -- especially the fighters and the high rollers.  Then the Barbarian slaughters the Wizard who is now forever dead with all her gear surrounding her body on the ground for the Barbarian to choose from, and you're out 10 million gold.  I honestly feel like this would breath so much life into the longevity of Diablo 3.  Not to mention, collecting Hardcore player's Ears would be the most noble of achievements proving you farm for items like a real man.*


**7.) Insane Mode**

*Give every trash monster one random affix.  This could possibly apply to Bosses as well?  I just think it would be amazing to gather up a huge wave of monsters and see how many roll fire chain.  There are just too many fun possibilities to summarize here



**8.) Champion Levels**



*This is a popular one that's been thrown around a lot.  I think this would make the biggest impact on rewarding gameplay post-lvl 60.  How I understand it should work


-Faster Town Portal/Identify casting

-Repair cost discount

-Shorter respawn timer

-Start new games with 1 NV stack

-Allow more than one follower to tag along

-An unlimited Healing Potion

-A helper picks up gold for you

-Access to stash from anywhere

-Mobile salvage option ([Nephalem Cube](http://www.diablowiki.net/images/f/f6/Nephalem-cube-tooltip.jpeg))

-Mobile vendor option ([Cauldron of Jordan](http://www.diablowiki.net/Cauldron_of_Jordan))

-Monster affixes are visually indicated above their head

-Vanity particle effects (smoke/fire/light/etc) surround your character

-Lower cooldown for Skill Swapping

-Enemies show on minimap

-etc.

1339937618.0,v6d79,"A Story from the Early Days of SC2 (Or: How I learned to stop worrying, and start waiting for a patch to come out before complaining about balance issues)",flagbearer223,708,283,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/v6d79/a_story_from_the_early_days_of_sc2_or_how_i/, so I'll explain it as if you've never played.

Back before this patch, and they were mainly used for controlling positioning in a battle.  Infestors had two abilities which let them do this: Fungal Growth and Neural Parasite.  Fungal Growth would freeze a group of units for 8 seconds and do a, for all intents and purposes, negligible amount of damage over those 8 seconds.  Neural Parasite is a spell that gives you control over a unit for a few seconds (something like 12), then gave it back to your opponent.

Now, but boosting the base damage slightly, and giving bonus damage vs Armored units.  **Everyone** on /r/starcraft started freaking out about how useless Infestors would be.  Infestors were losing 50% of their effectiveness as CC units.  Now, instead of being able to hold groups of enemy units in place for 16 seconds, they could only do it for 8.  They became essentially useless for the role that they had fallen into, and pretty much everyone on /r/starcraft thought that they would become useless and would just become another Hydra (a Zerg unit that is basically useless except for in very specific circumstances).

So what happened?

The exact opposite.  These days, and usually twice that number.  Infestors became killing machines, and there were two main reasons behind it.  The main reason that they became ""killing machines"" was the reduction from 8 to 4 seconds for the DoT/CC of Fungal Growth, which meant that the DPS of it had been doubled.  This meant that Terrans were no longer able to heal their units with Medivacs faster than Infestors were able to deal damage, which meant that Infestors now finally had a significant use against Terran.  A single infestor could kill a group of ~12 marines if they were clumped up in the correct way, and they usually were.

The second reason was the increase in damage against Armored units.  Zergs (and everyone else) were being absolutely trounced by this thing called the Protoss Death ball.  It was basically a bunch of middle &amp; end game Protoss units that were clumped up and attack-move'd towards an enemy, and those that weren't were easy to kill once the armored ones were dead.  Because of the buff to armored damage, Zergs just had to land a couple of nice fungals to basically reduce the health of the enemy army to ~50%, and while it wouldn't be easy to win from that position, it was very much in the realm of possibility (which was an improvement over what was going on pre-patch).

So what's the moral of the story?  Blizzard isn't full of idiots.  At least in SC2, and I think everyone is overreacting.  That said, I will admit that Blizzard does make some bad decisions every once in a while, but that doesn't mean that every single Blizz balance change should be met with as much anger as the /r/Diablo community has been showing.

**tl;dr:  People freak out about pretty much every balance change that Blizz makes, then make angry posts if you feel it's justified.**

**EDIT**:  To everyone saying that I need to stop ""telling them to not complain, it's good for the game!  I'm saying *wait* until you better understand and have tested the changes rather than acting like any of us can predict the exact outcome (because, honestly, we can't).

1348594941.0,10gktu,A guide to the Infernal Machine (with pictures!),Fleme,505,82,166,"I do realize that there already are several guides (and videos) going around with info on how to combine the Infernal Machine. I ran a few tests on the droprates and hopefully my input here can be of some help.

**Post has been updated

**The Keys**

There are 4 keywardens you need to defeat in order to be able to assemble Infernal Machines although the one in Act 4 is someone you won't need to revisit for each machine as he's the one that drops the plan for it. Additionally,000 gold.

I ran a few test runs to see about the droprates of the keys and noticed a pattern. I tried at MP7 without 5NV and found that at least on the first kills I was not getting the Keys off the wardens. I then tried at MP7/NV5 and found that the droprate still wasn't 100%. I then proceeded to test at MP9. Without 5NV I was not seeing a guaranteed drop on this difficulty either but when I got 5NV on MP9 I got a key every time. I realize that it might not be feasible for everyone to farm these at MP9 but regardless

**Act 1**

[Odeg the Keywarden](http://i.imgur.com/czna1.jpg) can be found in the Fields of Misery. There spawn point is entirely random - I've had him right on the waypoint

**Abilities**

* Main attack is Spear Throw
* Has a triple-fireball attack
* Has Jailer

**Points of note**

If you're going on an Infernal Machine run and this key is the last one you need

**Act 2**

[Sokahr the Keywarden](http://i.imgur.com/bqn7E.jpg) can be found i the Dahlgur Oasis. Again

**Abilities**

* Sokahr is a Dune Dervish/Magewraith
* Has Missile Dampening on top of the natural deflection this mob type has
* Has Mortar &amp; Electrified
* Did not get a chance to find out whether or not he has other special abilities

**Act 3**

[Xah'Rith the Keywarden](http://i.imgur.com/XdSuS.jpg) can be found on the Stonefort in Act 3. Skycrown Battlements has actually been changed (I got 6 elite packs there instead of the usual 2-3) and Xah'Rith was waiting for me almost at the entrance to Stonefort. Very convenient to run

**Abilities**

* Xah'Rith is a Morlu Incinerator type of mob. This means he has the ability to teleport
* Instead of the Meteor Morlus usually have
* Has a freezing field type of attack. It doesn't freeze you like Frozen does but it will slow you down considerably.
* Has Illusionist

**Act 4**

[Nekarat the Keywarden](http://i.imgur.com/WpFBJ.jpg) can be found in Silver Spire level 1 and he's a huge ass. No, which inflicts -75% to all healing effects for... 6-8 seconds. He drops the [Plan: Infernal Machine](http://i.imgur.com/hbfDO.jpg)

**Abilities**

* Terror Demon basic attack - frontal lightning
* Curse: -75% to healing effects
* Aoe damage over time fire attack
* Jailer
* Knockback

**Points of note**

As a barbarian I could not fight this guy face to face. I had to kite him and let sprint do the job mostly. By far the most annoying of the 4

**Assembly**

As mentioned

**Realm of Chaos**

As mentioned in the Act 1 part, specifically ""Return to New Tristram"". Shift-attack will break down the door. Inside, you'll find an empty room in which you can activate your Infernal Machine to create a portal to the [Realm of Chaos](http://i.imgur.com/c5KLf.jpg)/Discord/Turmoil, each of which will feature 2 bosses simultaneously.

In this example, both with 88M hp and regular abilities. This was on Monster Power 9, with 5 stacks on NV and the loot was in line with that; [1 part of the Hellfire Ring](http://i.imgur.com/EWmJc.jpg).

In the [previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/u3w0z/diablo_3_potentially_has_an_arg_alternate_reality/) there was much talk over the validity of this ARG, or just a very coincidental event. There were a few main points made on this topic:

#1. ""The reflection is just a graphical glitch""

Thanks to [JpDeathBlade](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/u3w0z/diablo_3_potentially_has_an_arg_alternate_reality/c4s8b1p?context=3), the sheer number of coincidences is too staggering to write it off as a glitch.

[SauciestBoss](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/u3w0z/diablo_3_potentially_has_an_arg_alternate_reality/c4s9wfe?context=3) did some thinking on how the reflection could be replicated. His theory has yet to be tested. 

#2. ""If there were a secret level hidden in the game

This is the biggest issue, a [spoiler]cow[/spoiler] model *was* found in the files, and other various unused things were found. (spoiler is just for people who don't want to be potentially exposed to what this *might* lead to.)

[JpDeathBlade](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/u3w0z/diablo_3_potentially_has_an_arg_alternate_reality/c4s7qxp) has a good post on this.

Very important for Monks and Barbarians. For 1H weapons

**Cold damage bows/xbows**

Cold damage causes skills that don't have a particular damage type to slow mobs

**All resist + Any resist**

Monks have a passive that sets all their resistances to their highest resistance. It makes sense for them then to go for gear that has All + Poison/lightning/cold resist exclusively, it should sell for much more than an equivalent item with no Poison resist. Might take a bit of time to sell since there aren't that many Monks with a lot of gold who happen to choose poison/cold/lightning spec.

**+Armor**

Many people ignore but it is a very important attribute. Especially for Barbarians because they have a lot of +Armor% skills. To figure out price put in the other modifiers and sort by Armor in order to compare.

**Magic Find %**

Some people don't realize how valuable this is. It's very valuable. The max MF value is 20% for all slots except Amulets (40%). 20%/40% blues will sell well

**Sockets**

Sockets add a ton of value to every item. Their value also increases slowly as people get higher tier gems. Consider each socket to be worth at least +50 of any stat.

I wanted to start at the beginning so that people will get an overall understanding of how the mortal world came to be and to get a better understanding of what is happening in the subsequent Diablo I


There are basically three worlds in the Diablo Universe, and the mortal world known as Sanctuary.  In the beginning, Sanctuary did not exist and neither did humans.  There was only the High Heavens and Burning Hell.  The two worlds battled each other endlessly for control in what is known as the Great/Eternal Conflict.  This war has lasted since the beginning of creation, and while each side would gain the advantage every now and then, it has pretty much been a stalemate.   


The burning hell was lead by the three Prime Evils

•	[Tyrael - The Archangel of Justice (Male)](http://i.imgur.com/uN76t.jpg)   
•	[Auriel - The Archangel of Hope (Female)](http://i.imgur.com/izYCc.jpg)  
•	[Malthael – The Archangel of Wisdom (Male)](http://i.imgur.com/DQHx0.jpg)  
•	[Imperius – The Archangel of Valor (Male)](http://i.imgur.com/N9m3A.jpg)  
•	[Itherael – The Archangel of Fate (Sexless


There was one more powerful Archangel that acted as an advisor to the Angiris Council, Inarius hid the presence of Sanctuary from Heaven and Hell.    


Humans were the off springs of Angels and Demons that lived in Sanctuary and were very powerful at first.  The first generations of humans were known as Nephalem, draining them of their innate powers.  He wanted humans to worship him, and created a relgion/cult called the Cathedral of Light.  The Prime Evils were the first to discovered Sanctuary, and attempted to gain influence over the population and recruit them as soldiers in the Great Conflict.  Not wanting to alert the high heavens of Sanctuary's existence, they formed a religion/cult called the Triune.  Both religion recruited followers and used them for their own purpose.   


A lot more happens before the events of the first Diablo, Uldyssian tapped into the Worldstone and unleashed his tremendous power, so great in fact that it was going to destroy all of Sanctuary.  Once he realized this, he sacrificed himself to save the mortal world.  This is when the Agiris Council discovered Sanctuary and what Inarius has done.  They descended into Sanctuary and were going to destroy it since they viewed it as an abomination tainted with demon blood.  After all, humans were half demon as they were the off spring of Angels and Demons.    


Of the 5 in the Agiris Council, the Archangel of Wisdom abstaining from voting.  Tyrael, the last to vote, was originally disgusted by the tainted humans and wanted to destroy it.  If he had voted yes, the tie would have doomed Sanctuary for destruction.  However, after seeing Uldyssian’s sacrifice, he voted no and Sanctuary was spare.  Tyreal was so impressed by Uldyssian’s act because Uldyssian had basically become all powerful.  He would have been a god, and it moved Tyrael.  This made Tyrael see the good in mankind


This wraps up the pre-diablo I history.  If you guys like this, and there is plenty of stuff out on the web as well to read through if you want to do your own research.  Leave me any questions you have and I’ll try and answer them as best as I can.  

**TL:DR - The moral world

Edit:  There seems to be a genuine interest in the rest of the lore.  I wrote up everything up to and including Diablo I and will post it shortly.  Although [Crackensan did a quick summary](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/sqhuw/the_story_so_fara_recount_of_what_has_happened/c4g5wvc) of most of the events already leading all the way up to Diablo 3 so it's a great summary.

**Edit:** Since many people are looking at their profile's ""elite kills"" stat, but a single run will not always be at 5 stacks, so even with 300 base MF you'll be seeing legendaries less frequently than once per 84 elite packs you slay. 

- - - - - - - - - -

**OP:**

A bunch of people have been researching the shit out of MF

It's all very complicated

* Each item an elite pack drops has about a 0.05% chance to be legendary before MF is applied

* The math thus suggests you get almost exactly 1 legendary per 500 elite pack kills with no MF and no Npehlaem Valor. 

* Upping this to 300% base MF, the math suggests you will get an average of 1 legendary drop per 84 elite pack kills.  

* At max MF, it'll be more like 25%. 

* Because 5 stacks guarantees you 1 rare per elite kill

* Another little known fact is that the rare you get from 5-stacks is disproportionately likely to be 4 property

* Legendary items are so extremely rare that you will not see many of them no matter what MF you have. You'll also see great variation - while one per 84 packs is much more than one per 500 packs,False,self,t5_2qore,1347560890.0,,barb-americas idscroll,t3_zse6a

1349297020.0,10w8nn,My two cents about Diablo 3 after 400 hours played.,pedward,742,347,279,"For a long period of time, detail my experiences playing Diablo 3

1. ""I dislike doing the same thing over and over again
    - Diablo 2 was the second video game I ever got into, but after my what seemed like millionth Mephisto run with MF gear on, I can honestly say that the D3 system of champ pack hunting is much more exciting.

2. The class and build diversity is too low in D3.
   - I love the class diversity. I found it incredibly annoying to have to relevel a new character every time I wanted to try out the new ""it"" build. I like being able to experiment

3. There's no point to play with people, HALP!
    - I play with 4 people pretty much all the time, and not to have fun slaying massive hordes of demons, you're going to have a bad time.

4. The RMAH degrades the playability of the game! I can't break into the market because I'm not willing to spend money on the game!
    - False, you could easily farm A3 with any class with barely 10 mil in investments. Stop whining about how you can't beat the game in five minutes with crappy gear, and start earning your keep and doing the grind the rest of us are doing. Being good takes time, I can guarantee that the people who have insane amounts of gear and high paragon levels don't get there by whining about how they can't kill stuff fast enough. They take time to understand mechanics, tweak builds and create something they can put their mark on.

5. The drop rates aren't high enough to perfectly gear my character without using the AH! This is a conspiracy by Blizzard to take my money!
    - As a person who has given a lot of money to Blizzard throughout my WoW years, they were trying to make it easier for you to gear your character, and give you an outlet to try and make gold. They also put the AH in the get rid of the JSP people who caused a lot of problems in D2. The AH is a humongous quality of life improvement for me compared to Diablo 2, and I don't think the game would be as exciting without it. 

6. The items have no permanence
    - I personally love this, will always leave me hungry for some way to get a bigger edge than anyone else has. This personally drives me, and I enjoy it.

Overall, from what I've found, the people that truly enjoyed Diablo 2 are the ones still playing, because there is a lot of good in Diablo 3. I believe that Blizzard did release an unfinished game, but I personally think that it was a blessing because they've been able to tailor the game over the past months to EXACTLY WHAT IT'S PLAYER BASE IS DEMANDING! No other gaming corporation in the world would do this with such rigor. They have people trolling Reddit for great ideas that would make their game more fun and playable. I personally appreciate that Blizzard gave its player base a baby to develop so that the game would be perfectly suited for the people that showed dedication and kept playing.

I think Diablo 3 is one of the most fun games I have ever played, or how you can't stand in desecrating and arcane beams on your character the game isn't balanced right, then get out, I don't want you on my game.

However, stay and play with me. I don't really believe in giving my gamer tag out in posts, but PM me if you feel like this describes you, or you have a similar belief about the state of Diablo 3.

TL; DR: Stop complaining

-Z


edit: spelling.
Edit: Rebuttals.

I didn't ever expect this post to be such a flame fest. I didn't even expect most people would read it

Yes, actually devising something to do about it is incredibly hard. 

If I were a game dev for Diablo 3 here are the changes I would make:
1. Guild system, and bonuses for completing guild achievements.
2. Make crafting an easier solution to gearing problems.
3. Get rid of Reflects Damage, and rapes most range characters.
4. Expand abilities that are fun. For instance
5. Buff monks. Honestly
6. Add a Paragon ladder
     - Add PVP as an addendum.
7. Add an endless dungeon system where monster power becomes multiplicative, then MP 20, and then... well I doubt you would make it that far.
8. Enhance fun, I would like to be able to use sentries and other such things that I can be inventive with.
9. Install a gold price floor. I know many people are like ""WTF, making it impossible for new people to buy good items. If you set the floor, you will see the economy normalize and people will be able to make a better foray into the ALREADY NERFED TO THE GROUND INFERNO difficult by affording good items.

I am not naive, I do not, will not, and have never used the RMAH and the game flows just fine for me. That being said, I have sold many items on the RMAH for a pretty profit and even bought my fiance a Kindle Fire from my proceeds. So, is it for Blizzard profit? Yes. Should you complain about a system that lets you profit from a video game, I think not

Peace

There are a bunch of different posts with links on how to do various farming runs. I thought I would make a consolidation of these

**First

**1) Royal Crypt Farming:** 

http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/ufe19/inferno_gold_farming_stats_to_400khr/

**Pros**: near-zero threat of death. Easy to get access to this location. 

**Cons**: could die from boredom. No chance at getting that lottery-ticket 30 million dollar item.

**Estimated G/hr**: Roughly 250-500k gold/hr

**2) Act 1

http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/ue2s4/dank_cellar_farming_numbers/

**Pros**: near-zero threat of death. Easy to get access to this location. 

**Cons**: Could die from boredom. Small chance at getting that lottery-ticket 30 million dollar item.

**Estimated G/hr**: Roughly 250-500k gold/hr

**3) Butcher/Warden 5-stack valor farming**:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG5ju_GuBmw

**Pros**: Low gear requirement. Still relatively easy to get access to this location. Non-repetivive (relatively speaking) farming.

**Cons**: Highly fluctuating reports of success here. I tried it and got almost entirely garbage.

**Estimated G/hr**: Roughly 250-400k gold/hr

**4) A4 Aspects farming:**

http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/ueqmv/witch_doctor_act_4_inferno_zombie_bears_farming/

**Pros:** Access to top ilvl weapons here. Chance to pull in that 30 million dollar 1650 dps 2her. 

**Cons**: Could die from boredom. 30 second runs are very repetitive. Very very streaky farming. You pull in so much gear that you can flood your AH account and ""get stuck"". 

**Estimated G/hr:** 400k to 2+ million/hr. **Note:** this is very hard to estimate

**5) Siegebreaker 5-stack NV farming:**

http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/ubxat/my_barbarian_act_3_inferno_farming_guide/

**Pros**: Access to top ilvl weapons here. Chance to pull in that 30 million dollar 1650 dps 2her.
 
**Cons**: One of the hardest places to farm, considering how many tough monsters there are, elite or not. I'm talking Pestilence (green hand of death mobs), tons of ranged mobs, dragons from the sky, tongue spitters, etc... easier as a group.

**Estimated G/hr**: 400k to 2+ million/hr. **Note:** this is very hard to estimate, but way less blues, this could make it even streakier than A4 aspects in this regard. 

[**6) Inferno Ponies**](/spoiler)


[No guide on this that I can find. You can go into the diablo room

[**Pros**: Could be the single highest Ilvl place in the game (inferno ponies). Could be easy to do (getting 5 stack NV will be cake at least

[**Cons**: may be very very hard to do, unless blizzard just doesn't want pony farming to be what people do, and the pony level to be ""neat"" only.](/spoiler)

[**Estimated G/hr**: Completely unknown at this point.](/spoiler)

**7) Rakanoth 5-stack NV farming**

No guide on this yet

Basically you would build up a 5-stack NV buff (this could be the harder part, because this is the most obvious direct comparison to this farming strategy. If SB/Rak drop same ilvl loot, then this method would likely not be a good choice, just farm the lootbreaker pinata instead. However, if Rak drops better gear than SB, then this could actually be the best spot to get the absolute highest ilvl gear with only diablo or inferno ponies as other options. As the AH floods with A3 level rares, this could be the ""next step"". Anyone know any answers on ilvl of Rakanoth vs Siegebreaker drops?

**Pros**: Could be the one of the highest Ilvl place in the game. 

**Cons**: Massive barrier to entry. Must be able to both kill rakanoth easily and to be able to farm A4 elite packs at a reasonable rate.

**Estimated G/hr**: Unknown. This could be the next step though


**Short Personal Opinion to spark Discussion**

So feel free and go ahead and discuss your best strategies for farming. I've personally been doing the A4 aspects a lot, even getting a 1300 dps 2-her won't make a whole lot of money. It's getting to the point where you need yellows, not blues, because yellow armor will usually sell better than anything but the most insanely high rolls on weapons! Heck, even a 1450 dps 2her will net less gold than geting nice rolls on some bracers/gloves/ring/ammy, etc. 

Siegebreaker seems like the next (or actually the) best place if you want to farm gear

**Deflation of the AH**

Also to consider is the fact that AH values are coming down and down and down, if a lot of people then switch to gold farming, you will get less flood on the AH, and we'd reach an natural equilibrium where the two methods are equally valid, possibly slightly favoring magic finding, since there is a higher barrier to entry for MFing.

1337169487.0,tptnq,My spoiler free notes on the Witch Doctor after beating normal.,FrankenstinksMonster,468,91,404,"The short version:  The witch doctor is fun

Rather than make this a complete review that might include my build, I'm just going to talk 
about the interesting points.

The witch doctor's resource is not as straight forward as it seems like it should be.  I mean
its just mana right?.  The mana cost on your spells
has two effects:
1) Attributes that add mana gets less useful - this is a really minor issue
2) Your mana regeneration gets slower and slower

The second point is what I noticed.  There seems to be an expectation that you will add some mana recovery
to your build
be sufficient for my build

I thought locust swarm was going to suck, 
and the rune that makes it spread to 2 targets it is AMAZING.  Its like setting everything
on the screen ON FIRE.  It seemed like it would jump up to 15 yards away
be close or bunched up for it to work - some enemies really scatter far apart though
poison dart/haunt on those.  It has great synergy with the passive that reduces enemy damage when affected 
by poison and even has decent damage per mana for bosses.  My approach to most situations was soul siphon
grasp of the undead
to taste.

The gargantuan
6 times on normal and most of that was to some really bad rare/champion group.  There were only two bosses 
that killed him and even then it took long enough that I could recast him.  My problem was noticing I 
needed to recast since I wasn't used to him dying.  Dogs
taking them without taking sacrifice.

Haunt was great for champions, particulary the one that lets you 
cheat death every 90 seconds
passive kicked in several times and saved me.  I did have a lot of health from vitality and +health from
orbs though (I had around 2k life at the end of normal and +450 health from orbs).

Soul siphon continued to be overpowered throughout normal
a problem in latter difficulties.  At level 30 5 stacks would take my dps from 220 to 420

Acid cloud was dissapointing.  I tried to make it work

Locust swarm and haunt are great for times when you can't stand still.  The short range on locust swarm sucks
but keeping poison up for 8 seconds per cast to reduce enemy damage (with the passive) is helpful.

I played with a buddy
what it really was
game did not dissapoint.  I got bored with saying 'wow look at that' in vent after doing it for ten hours.

pretty awesome for the release day of such a popular game.  As a final vote of confidence

Hello everyone

###Opening Cinematic

At the end of Diablo II, the last remaining Prime Evil has assembled a massive army and is now making [his assault on Mt. Arreat]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ7KgW_yi3E&amp;feature=relmfu), home of the courageous barbarian tribes.  These [barbarian tribes](http://i.imgur.com/NButc.jpg) lived for the glory of battle, and were considered to be some of the fiercest warriors Sanctuary had to offer.  This is why they were tasked with the important role of guarding Mount Arreat, home of the coveted Worldstone.  

###Diablo II: Lord of Destruction – Act V

Tyrael opens a portal for our heroes to the barbarian city of [Harrogath, now lies in ruins.  Harrogath is the last Barbarian stronghold, and is currently under siege by Baal’s Army.  Many brave barbarians have died to defend the fortress, and many more die each day as the siege continues.  Shenk the Overseer, Baal’s most decorated general, is leading the siege against Harrogath.  

If not for the Druid “Spell of Warding”, received word that Baal’s army was coming and that many of their brethrens had failed to deter his ungodly army.  In a courageous act of selflessness and courage, they sacrificed their lives to cast the “Spell of Warding”, a warding spell that would par passage to any hell spawn, including the Lord of Destruction himself.  Only one person survived the casting of the spell, Nihlathak, who struggles daily with the guilt of being spared and the grief of his lost companions. While the spell has worked so far, the Barbarians fought on without a hint of uncertainty.  

##Siege of Harrogath

Fearing the worst however, the [Assassin](http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/Assassin) and the [Druid](http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/Druid).  This brings us up to a total of 7 heroes] (/spoiler).  While the barbarians joined the heroes on the battlefield, they did not see them as equals, but rather as a mere distraction for the demons as the barbarians were the real warriors.  This attitude quickly changed as the barbarians’ bear witness to the ferocity that the heroes employed on the front lines.  The holy paladin, zealous in his attacks, brought justice down upon the demons spawn with his hammer over and over again.  Bolts of lightning and thunder ripped through the sky, while raging hydras of fire roared from the very bowels of earth, commander of nature’s elements.  At times, down the slopes of Mount Arreat, and Baal’s advance towards the Worldstone came to a sudden and jolting end.  Or so it seems…

##Prison of Ice

Unbeknownst to the Barbarian tribes and the heroes, pondered endlessly on what they could have done differently.  He concluded that there was only one way, and stuck a deal with the Lord of Destruction.  In return for Harrogath’s safety, Nihlathak will give Baal the Relic of the Ancients.  This holy totem allowed anyone who possesses it to bypass the Rite of Passage at the summit of Mount Arreat, and be granted access to the chamber of the Worldstone.   With the holy totem in hand, Baal and his army proceeded to the inner chambers of Mount Arreat, known as the Worldstone Keep. 

No one knew that this had happened, uncovers Nihlathak’s plan.  To avoid his secrete from being reveal, Nihlathak kidnapped Anya and imprisoned her in the icy caves of the Crystalline Passage.  It is not until the heroes rescued Anya that is information is revealed (The quest to kill Nihlathak, Betrayal of Harrogath, becomes available at this point, but it is optional).

1342182932.0,whvbu,How to fix the WitchDoctor class,WitchHunterNL,574,199,388,"
I'm a 100 hour Witch Doctor player that has progressed quite a bit through Act 3 and I think

The class requires a lot more money than other classes to go above 60k DPS thanks to the lack of dual wielding or other overpowered properties of a class (2h + offhand anyone?), as the primary attack of the WD **consumes** mana.

[Vision Quest](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/class/witch-doctor/passive/vision-quest) is the main passive of almost every succesfull inferno build, skills should be used when a player needs them, not just to put them on cooldown.

What we get thanks that passive is that many WD players including myself use 4 or 5 skills with **cooldown**

Pets are a joke

Another problem of the WD is the unnecessary difficulty of kiting. For kiting WDs have [spirit walk](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/class/witch-doctor/active/spirit-walk)

The CC abilities of the WD: [grasp of the dead](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/class/witch-doctor/active/grasp-of-the-dead) and [wall of zombies ](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/class/witch-doctor/active/wall-of-zombies)both have a casting delay and quite a long cooldown compared to [blizzard](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/class/wizard/active/blizzard) and [caltrops](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/class/demon-hunter/active/caltrops).

The best way to fix Witch Doctors would in my opinion be:

* **TRIPLE THE BASE AND AFFIX MANA REGENERATION! ** 

This clears up a passive slot and fixes the cooldown issue and makes the other half of the skills for 4 slots viable again.

Other buffs (awesome but not necessary) would be:

* Reduce cooldown and shorten cast animation of Grasp of the Dead and Wall of Zombies (**only with the mana regen fix**)
* Increase duration / shorten cooldown of Spirit walk
* Make pets more tanky
* Make WDs able to dual wield (cheap damage)

My friend Todd and I  run a stream mainly for Redditors at **www.twitch.tv/cdxliv** we do 100% viewer runs and giveaways. So far our viewers have gotten over 100+ keys and over 60 legendaries on these runs in just the past 3 days. 


This [post you see on the front page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/11pxom/this_is_why_you_dont_go_afk_on_your_streams/) was a stream giveaway gone horribly wrong. I disconnected by going afk and lost all that legendary



So far



We are doing a very special giveway of a full wizard CM set when we hit 500 viewers (we had 480 last night so it should be pretty easy) you can see the set [here](http://i.imgur.com/adspY.jpg) It can easily farm MP8 and is worth over 500M gold. It will be given away to a viewer. 



**The Rules: You have to be a viewer who is also a follower of the stream. You have to be NA-US and have a level 60 wizard (we want people to actually use this amazing set and not just sell it) we just do a random roll of all the viewers and the winner gets the ENTIRE SET.** 



I am estimating we should hit the 500 viewer mark at around 8PM so I will do the giveway at 9-10PM EST.  Best of LUCK TO EVERYONE


For those of you without a 60 wizard

So, I needed to be very tanky, but I also needed TONS OF DAMAGE.

I couldn't find a balance between those two things - and the thing that always killed me when I switched away from a healing Mantra was that I just didn't have enough spirit to spam my less efficient healing without the defensive boost from Mantra of Evasion.

So. I went to the AH and I spent 1.2mil on a crazy fast fist weapon (1.62 attacks/second), since it was the only one with +5% to deadly reach AND a socket AND 50 dex AND spirit regen (in hindsight, I didn't need this. I seriously underestimated the effectiveness of this build at generating spirit).

So, you ask.

Well, obviously, yay +50% armor), and I'm using a shield in the offhand - that's 2.1 attacks/second WITHOUT the dual wield boost.

I use Seize the Initiative

But Z

Trust me

Now what

This was actually the hardest thing for me to figure out. I kinda felt like Monk had no really good spirit dumps. People tell me that Burning Palm or whatever that big single target DoT is is good

We have to have Sweeping Wind, and Sweeping Wind does that very, VERY well.

We have to have Breath of Heaven, Serenity is amazing if you want to go alpha strike a big, squishy, high damage unique.

But Z

Oh fuck yes you can. And you WILL. Why? How? Because we're going to take Mantra of Conviction with the double effect rune, and then we're going to slam about seven Lashing Tail Kicks (Scorpion Sting) into some poor, unsuspecting elite's face at +48% damage.

But Z

Retarded like a fox, which was AMAZING when I got penned in by accident but useless in the 90% of fights where I didn't make a really stupid mistake and get trapped in a corner. I tried Essence Burn on the skill I always forget the name of - you guys know what I'm talkin' bout.

And I was just about to say ""I guess monks just don't have a great damage spirit dump"". And then I tried, cuz I noticed it said ""replaces knockback"".

Well, and it kills Horde/minion packs FUCKING DEAD. I can literally two shot most of the trash in A1 Inferno with this skill.

I'm a Demon Hunter

Now, again.

Where do I see this build going?

Ideally, huge deal, and it's MUCH cheaper to buy stats on a shield than it is to buy stats on a weapon - 1 handers with DEX and VIT go for a loooot of gold right now.

I think Act 2 is gonna be another really huge defensive gear check

That said, high DPS weapons are likewise, expensive as fuck. However I think this build has some really significant advantages over other monk builds.

TL;DR build pros and cons:

+ High damage output

+ Good at kiting AND excellent in close range aoe combat

+ Quite durable compared to most ""dps"" builds

+ Doesn't need tons and tons of VIT

+ You only need like 8-10% crit from gear to keep Sweeping Wind stacked pretty reliably

-Very, however, think that this is a flaw that most monk builds have. Monks just really need their gear.)

-If you run out of spirit, it also provides sustain from Transcendence AND mitigation in the form of constant mini-stuns from Scorpion Sting.

Whatcha think

1374057888.0,1ih878,I feel that blizzard is wrong; an endless dungeon actually makes for great endgame.,whazfan69,479,132,201,"First

&gt;What happens is players start… like it drives you into starting gameplay styles. We saw this some at release, but not very fun to play. Yeah, I can beat something, but it took sixty minutes of kiting. Which is really fun and exciting the first time you do it, but isn’t something we really want to encourage people to do en masse.

&gt;But I think that the idea that there is greater challenge out there is cool. I think the idea of I want to test my character is cool. I think the idea of this game is too easy and I would like a great challenge is cool. So the desire behind those is cool, we found didn’t work.

Well, namely that tanky builds are boring and people have to faceroll to enjoy themselves.  Personally, I enjoy both styles, and would like both to be viable and rewarding within D3 (and I think it bears pointing out that the game had way more players when everyone was fighting for their life trying to beat inferno diablo).  Beyond this however, I feel like the scope of their prototype does not give the concept of an endless dungeon a fair chance to succeed, and so rather than just sit here and whine about it let me give you a version of an endless dungeon that I came up with over the last 30 minutes, and let's see where we can go from there.  This is not the first post on the topic, but it really bothers me how easily they wrote this off based on the contents of the interview.

**Idea #1:** Different boss fights every 10th (Xth) level.  Each level has a starting safe area where mobs cannot enter and you can theory craft the content ahead


**Idea #2:** Different combinations of preset (either hard set or easily determined before you get deep into the level) elite packs and mobs and/or specific affixes on various levels.  If you severely outgear the content/level, be ready to adapt your build and/or gear (grab a shield, throw in vit gems, change your skills, whatever) to clear the content.  Examples include:

- Levels where vast majority of incoming damage is fire based

- Levels where vast majority of enemies are hordelike, melee reduction, exploding palm, whirlwind, etc..

- Levels laid with traps.  The game already has the ability for triggerable traps, etc... to really shine?

- Levels with elites / bosses that have quick enrage timers

- Levels where elites / mobs do insane burst damage


**Idea #3:** The endless dungeon scales with MP level, just on an MP level that's a bit below your gear level.


**Idea #4:** Certain new legendaries only drop on certain dungeon level ranges or from certain bosses


**Idea #5:**
Parties or individuals are given a certain number of ""wipes"" at the start of an endless dungeon, maybe there's a better solution I don't know.

**I think the point here is we need content that is challenging, gear level etc...  We need a mechanism that adapts to this reality better than Monster Power currently does.  Also, there are a lot of elements already built into the game that have been whitewashed by power creep.  I frankly don't even look at the monster affixes anymore, and I certainly don't care about static environment traps.  Maybe we can add a lot of variety to the game simply by finding a way to reintroduce these concepts through level design and/or de-randomizing the mobs and elites?  Either way, please god blizzard find a way to make this game interesting other than just new tilesets, random spawns, and itemization...give us a challenge

Diablo 2 had a great level of randomization as well

Blizzard clearly has a metric shit ton of experience handling a massive multiplayer game. So many posts on the official Diablo forums and on /r/Diablo highlight tons of things in Diablo that are a bit rough around the edges but are really polished in WoW. Given that Blizzard is the same company behind WoW

Don't get me wrong, I'm so curious as to why *the same company behind WoW* seems to have done a poor job implementing almost identical structures in another game from their stable?

1342798632.0,wvlml,Actually Playing Auction House Tycoon - My Story,tashinorbo,509,156,272,"Approximately two weeks ago a friend and I stumbled upon a 6-prop recipe. It was easily our best drop of the day and

My friend wanted to sell it, well crafting was a great unknown. Also intrigued by the possibility my friend agreed we should see what came of it.

The recipe was for boots and so we began to produce. We consumed the recipe and seeded 11m towards production. I keep stats on everything so I know that on that day we made 62 boots at a total cost of 8

The next day things got a bit out of hand

This was the turning point for how things would develop. Dealing with that many boots was awful. We didn’t have the time to do a single MF run and couldn’t stomach looking at the AH after so many hours. We considered scaling back

I had tasted too much possibility for gold to give-up though. I realized how much volume was required to be profitable and ride out the dry-spells, both thought I was crazy, but it was worth a shot.

With dreams of lots of gold I posted this thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wfz10/goldman_scathachs_is_hiring/ on reddit. Hoping to attract 5-6 people to help me sell. I ended up with almost 30 responses that resulted in my hiring 13 people. While initially I was apprehensive about giving them items I had already resolved myself to do so. As it turns out each of them was incredibly nice and earned my trust rapidly. I have no doubt that if I had posted this on the official forums I would have been swindled but I ended up with a very good group of people that I’m happy to continue working with.

Having a sales force changed the nature of my production. I started to become more concerned with providing each of them enough boots to sell and less concerned with my bottom line. Thankfully,888 gold.

That certainly isn’t all profit. I’ve made less money than that this week. But it radically altered the way I made money. Instead of relying on the rare valuable item I can now rely on steady streams of small money. The cumulative effect is much less risky and has made continuous crafting viable.

It occurred to me, and working with, several other crafters in the same position as me. Too many items, not enough time or sanity to price them all. By distributing the work nobody has to actually spend too much time with it, allowing more freedom to play the actual game, but everyone earns some small stream of money.

So yes, to that end i created www.goldmanscathachs.wordpress.com (Scathach being the rare mob name you sometimes see, IE Scathach the Horrible).

At this point I’ve spent hundreds of millions of gold on crafting and earned tens of millions in profit. As well as spending tens of hours crafting, but can earn gold. I would be happy to answer any questions I can.

And yes

1341743017.0,w7u5u,[Farming] I challenge you to name a more efficient Act I run,L4ncaster,490,142,390,"**[20 Minutes
*Numbers given in brackets are guaranteed and approx. potential packs*

Select Quest 9
  
1. Go to Northern Highlands WP

2. **[2-6]** Festering Woods WP: both dungeons. actually spend some time running around because you can get up to 3 packs outside and an event which is another pack

3. **[1-4]** Leoric's Manor WP: ~25 chance for packs to spawn in the manor itself, chance of another pack on the bridge outside the gate

4. **[2-8]** Cemetery of the Forsaken: ~25-50% chance of pack in the cemetery itself. Enter each crypt, and half the time the first one will be around 30 seconds from the entrance anyway. The crypts can be rectangular which is the last thing you want for farming, so grab one and TP. If you are in a crypt and you find a door to a 2nd level, leave. that's the quest dungeon and there's 0% chance of elites on the 2nd floor, but there can still be one on the first it's just not guaranteed. I get this dungeon around 25% of the time, and half of those times I'll find a pack in there anyway.   
      
     50% of the time you'll get the Jar of Souls event in a non-quest dungeon. The layout of a jar of souls crypt is almost always exactly the same: a square with two intersecting paths through the center
    
    &gt; [Maww] (http://dd.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/w7u5u/farming_i_challenge_you_to_name_a_more_efficient/c5b1xk3): *You don't need to stick around for it to finish. Just run up
     
     If you get the event with the wife whining about disturbed bones, and he'll disappear.** Turn in the quest across the room and you get a guaranteed rare. **It takes less than 10 seconds.** 

5. **[2-13]** Northern Highlands WP: Go to the watchtower you found earlier. Kill any pack you see along the way. Enter the watchtower. This dungeon has the highest potential elites to area ratio in the game. You can get up to five packs in a minuscule area, and there are usually like 2 shrines that seem to mostly be fortune.

6. **[3-10]** Highlands Crossing WP: head north until you find the Cave of the Moon Clan.   
     &gt; [miveal](http://dd.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/w7u5u/farming_i_challenge_you_to_name_a_more_efficient/c5b1jmjl): *Also, so looking around takes less than 30sec.*   
    
    I'd say it's worth checking. You'll usually pick up at least one other pack on the way in, or SE quadrants of the map. You'll have to get a feel for it. The first level has 1 guaranteed pack and up to 2 more, same for the 2nd level, plus a resplendent chest (which is shit but w/e). High chance of goblin spawn on both levels.

7. That's it

**[Rationale]**  
  
* The real benefit from doing shorter runs is that you're increasing the chance for a very good roll on packs/goblins/shrines for any given area you would have farmed anyway in a longer run. More reloads = more chances for an 8 pack Watchtower or 4 pack Leoric's Manor. From some discussion with a few redditors, which areas are the fastest, and will consistently deliver the most packs.

**[Rules to Follow]**

* Totally ignore trash mobs to the best of your ability. I hardly touch them. 
* Town portal whenever its faster
* Use some kind of speed boost. I use the monk's dash which allows me to teleport across the map and never touch a white monster. The DH has an arsenal of tools for this
* Only pick up rares, at all
* Some may disagree with this, they're shit but they often drop gems which i can always use). Containers are no longer effected by magic find. Regular chests are worthless, anything with gold in it is pretty worthless too. you're aiming to find items worth over a million gold. spending an extra 5 or 10 minutes to break containers equates to a full run lost (20-40 rares) after only a few runs. it's not worth it. 


**[[My Typical 1 Death per Run Stats](http://imgur.com/MVwdn)]**

* I'm on Act III inferno as a monk and this run (Act I not act III) is very easy for me. You can get up to 40 packs this way
  
* I'll use this section to point out that I can tear through this run with these stats, just lower your expectations for speed. Adding my DH friend to my party does not decrease my run times at all, in fact we tend to post the exact same times I do solo. The difference is that we get more packs by splitting up, which I detail [here](http://dd.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/w7u5u/farming_i_challenge_you_to_name_a_more_efficient/c5b0p97).   
  
* A tank/ranged party can do very well with this run. I wouldn't recommend any additional players unless they know the run and are dedicated to doing it properly. Lack of coordination (i.e. desynced town trips, and therefore less rares over time. Co-op only makes sense if you're playing with people who know what they're doing.   


[**Alternative for Those with 200%+ MF**]  
  
* From Braindog and coelomate:
    
1. Start the ""talk to Aleric"" subquest before the festering woods
2. Get the checkpoint in the Warrior's rest
3. Kill the Elite pack in the Warrior's rest
4. Restart the game; you'll pop right back at the beginning of the Warrior's rest

* coelomate:
  
    &gt; At low magic find levels a regular run through act 1 is better. But at ~200% magic find you get a decent number of rares per kill and can kill that champion pack as quickly as every 20-30 seconds.
All of the data I've collected from myself and others suggests it is more efficient than anything else in act 1

[**Additions**]  

* [gotreef](http://dd.reddit.com/user/gotreef):
  
     &gt; There has always been at least 1 elite on Cat lvl 3 for me. Additionally, the elite is somewhere to the east, towards the stairs to the 2nd floor which is basically a straight shot. I can only recall once where the elite pack was placed near the exit to the lower level (where the Jonaaaaar! event takes place).

1360258374.0,182p2l,Some Misconceptions of Twitch Streams,cdxliv,517,173,212,"Lately I have felt a general sense of hostility towards twitch stream related submissions on this sub-reddit. I would like to take this time to clarify some points that are factually inaccurate and somewhat inflammatory. 

**1. You guys make boat loads of money from people watching you!**


There are 3 sources of streaming income. donations

To date I have received around $450 USD in donations

Sponsors

Ad/Subscription Revenue from Twitch, I know I do. 

Now let's talk costs, Bell only recently provided truly unlimited bandwidth with good upload, and neither Todd nor I have access to it. Todd is on cogeco, I am on start. The first 2 month of streaming Todd's monthly ISP bill was $600CDN due to the overage fees, and I currently pay about $150-$200 a month. Of course not all the cost is due to the stream, but 2MB/s UP for 15 hours a day adds up.


**2. If you don't make money

Because it's fun, Todd and I can hop onto Team Speak and shoot the shit with our Mods and we can share the fun experience with our viewers. It usually takes around 10-15 hours to prep for a single educational Monday, we do the research, contact/invite guests, buy the possible parts on the AH, do the tests, tweak and optimize, and do the actual show. For Todd this is a daunting process since English is his second language. He has personally spent around 1.5B gold just in research and development for various wizard builds

**3. Streamers Take Advantage of this Subreddit by Spam Advertising**

I have been a redditor long before diablo 3 released, we raised $2000 USD for Autism Research and Child's Play, and I was immensely proud of this community.   

**4.Why Do People Watch Other People Play this SHITTY GAME?**

First of all I still enjoy D3 immensely and since most of us live in free countries we can play what we want. Now why do people watch streams? There's entertainment focused streams that do fun events and giveaways, we wanted to share information and knowledge about the game and hopefully in the slightest way possible make this game better and more enjoyable. 

**5. Quit your bitching

This is true

We are human beings just like you, accusations and insults appears extremely personal. I would like to say that our stream chat is one of the least moderated and most polite one I have seen on twitch, and for that I would like to thank everyone. It is discouraging sometimes when after all your hardwork, people still find the tiniest things to bitch at you and put you down. However we made the conscious decision of putting ourselves out there as semi-public figures , so we must also accept the consequences.  

**I apologize for this wall of text, Thank You**

**TL:DR, but I feel that our content contributes positively in a sea of ""GEARING HELP/IDEA!"" posts. People watch streams while they play games because it's fun to them and it's a free country. We need to vent sometimes because despite our best efforts the hate eventually has some impact. Thank you!**

---

So I've long been of the belief of keeping things on the down low as much as possible, spreading it leads to fixing it more so I'll just explain exactly how it works.

Start a chat line, for example ëë.  Then link the same item again (some of this might be extraneous but I know this works).  Put the cursor in between the two ë's.  Press delete three times.  Instead of deleting the entire [Archon Armor] it will just delete the [ and it will expose the item code.

The item code is a bunch of numbers and gibberish, but at the very minimum you can find a specific part just before the name that looks like this:

528:528:0:0:7:0

the 528 will be some random 3 digit number

You can expect that until this is patched, so don't buy them.  You can't do this from a link just in the trade chat from someone else.

As long as items don't change hands

1340691398.0,vm8oi,Endgame - PvE Endless Dungeon,Cyniae,452,113,123,"After watching Athene and Kripp's videos on endgame

The idea is similar to Torchlight

The endless dungeon unlocks the first time you hit level 60

When you enter, is bonus exp for clearing the level, and thus an alternative leveling path. The higher levels will be reminiscent of Inferno in difficulty (61 = A1, etc.) until you hit 65. Every level 65 and above, the difficulty rises slightly from Act 4, as well as drop rates of higher level items, including set and legendary (very minor increases.) Since the dungeon will be completely endless, the player can't move on to the next level until everything is dead

The levels themselves can be completely random (if Blizzard wants to design new areas), in order to keep it exciting, and if you remake the game you will likely get a different area. Each level will have some number of elite packs, and perhaps every 5th or 10th level will have a ""boss"", which again can be taken right from the game.

Saving can be done after every boss

This will also allow a ladder system for pve players to climb and boast about. Not sure how resetting would work

1337582451.0,tx6gr,In depth guide to the Critical Mass CDR Wizard (Infinite Diamond Skin + Permanent stun/freeze),PKCarwash,451,117,273,"EDIT: [Video of the build in action (not me)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViuwzlnAkTc#)

##**Intro**

Hey guys, and mage-tank it. It's a really satisfying build to use, and it's a lot different than the way I see most wizards playing. It's worth checking out.

##**Pros/Cons**

+Unquestionably the best AoE build for wizzard

+VERY high survivability

+Can solo easily

+Very fun to play

+You don't have to kite things for half an hour

-Ranged units can be trouble

-Item dependent later on (what isn't?)

-RNG (Can be overcome with items)

-Requires high level skills

##**TL;DR** here are build examples

[AoE focus](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/calculator/wizard#dbYhXO!gVT!acYcaY)

[Single target focus](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/calculator/wizard#dbYRXO!gVb!acabaY)

##**The Basics**

The gist of this build is to stack as much attack speed and crit as possible

~~As a secondary goal

~~The goal is to have enough HP regen to heal back 35% of your life per second or more

~~With zero +vitality, before running out, which gives you plenty of time to reduce the CD and cast it again. This makes it great for bosses and single target, where you can just stand there eating all their attacks.~~

With the recent nerf to force armor, and HP regen are still good options.

The nerf to force armor also makes this build a lot less viable for inferno (at least without a TON of top level gear), but it still works great in hell.

##**Required Passives**

* Critical Mass (Reduces your CD's by a ridiculous amount)

* Paralysis (Main nuke is high hit/second lightning nuke

##**Situational Passives**

* Glass Canon (You wont take any more damage due to diamond skin

* Galvanizing Ward (If you need more HP regen)

* Arcane Dynamo (Makes Explosive Blast do 75% more damage)

* Evocation (More CDR

##**Required Skills**

* Shock Pulse [Living Lightning] (Highest rate of attack so it procs literally dozens of crits per second

* Diamond Skin [Crystal Shell] (This becomes your HP bar)

* Frost Nova [Cold Snap for single target

* Energy Armor (Force armor makes your diamond skin able to tank a ton of shots before it goes down) (Pre-Inferno

##**Situational Skills**

* Wave of Force (""OH SHIT"" button + extra stuns...highly recommended)

* Hydra[Venom] (deals MASSIVE DoT with attack speed

* Explosive Blast [Chain Reaction] (No cast animation, best for AoE)

* Enchant Weapon [Force Weapon] (15% more damage


##**Itemization**

Int, resist all, and sockets are always something to look for on any item, but some items can't get certain stats...here's what to look for.

* Amulet - Crit chance

* Belt - Chance to freeze

* Boots - Chance to immobilize

* Bracers - Crit chance

* Chest - Nothing special

* Gloves - Attack speed, Crit damage

* Helm - Crit chance, Arcane power on crit (good for co-op, lets you spam high cost spells)

* Pants - Nothing special

* Ring - Attack Speed

* Shoulders - Nothing special

* Dagger(For fastest base attack speed) - Attack speed

* Off-hand - **Increased shock pulse damage**

##**Followers**

Followers are mostly personal preference.

* Scoundrel - 3% passive crit

* Enchantress - good AoE CC's

* Templar - extra healing

##**Tips**
* Try to peg ranged enemies with your first frost nova

* For single targets, so try to chain your CC's as efficiently as possible. Use them to interrupt telegraphed attacks.

* If you are in too deep

##**Theory crafting time**

With items I could buy on the auction house right now

Crit chance = 44.5%

Attack speed = 2.685/s

Chance to CC on hit

* Stun- ""up to"" 10.2% (Im not sure exaclty how much power surge gives)
* Freeze - 4.5%
* Fear - 5%
* Immobilize - 4.5%

Currently I am at 22% crit, and I can perma-interupt bosses (Killed Rak on hell without him casting a single ability) 

With 44.5% crit, **even bosses can be permanently stunned** 

##**Conclusion**

Honestly I think this is the single best Wiz build that has been discovered so far. It has high survivability, you run out of AP) and it doesn't take too much to get you started. Play it before it gets nerfed!

Let me know what you think

* Several of these slots already have ""boosted"" or ""primary"" rolls. For example, it may make more sense for DH or Monk to craft Vit gloves and hope for a 300 Dex / 330 Vit glove than crafting Dex gloves and hoping for a 330 Dex / 200 Vit glove.
* Vit is equally as useful
* If you play or plan to play multiple classes
* Vit-only amulet crafts can be used by all classes. For example, 9% Crit, 9% IAS, +dmg, socketed Amulet would likely be both a DPS and EHP upgrade for most people.

Therefore

1. Craft a few mainstat BoA items until you get a high DPS and mediocre defense roll (e.g. only has high vit
2. After you have this DPS-focused piece and want to focus on reaching BiS, you can eventually reach the 300 Mainstat/330 Vit combo.

(1) It really pains me when I think someone will fall for these tricks. Sure, it's their own problem.  But imagine someone who's not as keen at that moment, someone who spent tons of hours to farm his mere 5mil gold, makes a tiny mistake and loses all in 5 seconds.  Call me naive, but it pains me.


(2)I've talked to some scammers after calling them out.  It seems like they have enjoyed what they are doing a lot and claimed to be very rich.  This one guy told me he's sitting on 200 mil, though I have been sitting on 100 mil or so at one point (350 hrs played...).  But I hate to see these people getting so much gold with so little effort.  Sure, we get to enjoy the gameplay (farming?), but it's just not fair in my opinion.


(3) You might say, causing inflation and such, whereas these scammers are hurting the other players in the community directly.  But at least botters are at the risk of getting banned (or at least i hope so, despite the general impression of blizz's inability to deal with them). These scammers, for all I know, will never get banned, or dealt with by blizzard. They are just sitting there and laughing at the victims' face.


Since there's no way to stop the acts of scamming, so less people can fall for them.  If you guys think this is something old and meaningless, go ahead and downvote.  But if you think this might just help some people when they are about to get scammed, please contribute and upvote.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

tl;dr - I hope to compile a list of the various scams going on in D3. So people are more aware of them.  As it becomes harder to scam

I'll start off

(1) The unID peak method: Probably every redditor knows about it by now and not strictly a scam.  People are able to check the affixes (and the range of rolls) on an unID item. This includes the calculated Weapon DPS!
Edit: There are ways that you can check the exact value of the affixes.

(2) Fiery Brimstone Stack trick: I've seen most people do it with Fiery Brimstone(almost everyday).  They are able to use scripts to reduce the stack number before the trade goes through. Very easy too.

(3) Using scripts to take away item and hit accept: They do it extremely quick right before the buyer hit accept

(4) Using scripts to swap items in trade window before accepting: Basically swapping the good item with bad ones.  Most of the time

(5) Trying to cancel trade to trick you into dropping the item: Only works if you drag your item instead of right clicking.

(6) Deleting zeros when trading for money: 24mil turns into 2.4 mil. Hard to keep track of all those zeros. Could be done with script too as far as I know.

These are what I can come up with

1337687641.0,tz4ca,[S] The Butcher's return in Diablo III ,EreTheWorldCrumbles,546,218,592,"I was just reading about the old Butcher encounter from the first Diablo and came across [this article](http://diablo.incgamers.com/blog/comments/the-butcher-is-back) that speculates on the iconic Butcher's probable return in Diablo III.  
  
I read the hopeful comments speculating on how his terrifying return could be handled tactfully and respectfully and then there are the commenters apprehensive toward referencing a classic encounter that is best left in our minds where it has the most power.  
Then I imagined how disappointed these commenters must have been with the unabashedly nostalgic and superficial fanservice that was actually delivered.  
That thread is kind of a microcosm of what Diablo was to people
  
This feeling is pervasive throughout Diablo III with the whimsical and heavy handed treatment of bosses that we *ought to* fear. Even Diablo himself is rendered a dumb and incompetent villain by incessantly plotting and badgering the player with what comes across as insecure and childish remarks about how grand and unassailable his plans are.  
  
Granted if you play Diablo today you will undoubtedly find that it's not that scary, and it's not simply because we were children; it's an oppressive and evil atmosphere that was intentionally constructed by Blizzard North.       
What feelings will players take away from Diablo III's atmosphere?    
Likely a sense of superiority due to the unassailable nature of our Nephalem birthright
  
I love Diablo III, and consequently, the *respect* that the mysterious evils of the Diablo universe instilled in us.  

To quote a commenter on the aforementioned article:  
 
""What I envision is, and dim the lights). The walls are lined with meat hooks; most have a skinned and disemboweled human body on them. As you get near the end of the hallway, you hear a young girl crying. The corridor ends to reveal a large room. The Floor is covered in a mix of dry and fresh blood. There are naked bodies with gaping wounds stacked in piles on the floor. In the center of the room lays a massive thick wooden table, its stained red.  Each corner of the room has a barred cage. In one of them a young village girl weeps. As you approach her you hear “Mmmm Fresh Meat”""  
  
And here's what we got:  
""meet... THE BUTCHER!""  
""Fresh meat!"" 
""Zombie flesh good
Then we get an *encyclopedia* entry informing us that the original Butcher was not a special
 
And that encounter is indicative of the depth of atmosphere in Diablo III.  
When Diablo came out, our imaginations were assaulted through implication and deliberate guidance.  
  
It probably is more difficult to create a scary game today, because the graphics technology does most of the work.  
You have to really try to create an immersive and scary atmosphere, encyclopedic data, and megaphones through which bosses would literally explain to us why we should be scared.  
Diablo III is a really fun game that they should be proud of

1346959095.0,zgpd0,After 1.04: A constructive look at some of D3's current problems,FreeGiraffeRides,420,95,349,"Patch 1.04 was a great improvement to a promising game, and to suggest possible solutions.

**CORE ISSUES**

* **Environments** - Randomized environments have been a core feature of the Diablo series since the beginning. Contrary to Blizzard's pre-release claims, and more repetitive than in Diablo 1 or 2. A typical Diablo 2 dungeon might have millions of permutations, while many Diablo 3 dungeons have only a half-dozen permutations or less. Static outdoor areas are particularly tedious. An ideal solution would be to add new tiles to the game, as well as a more sophisticated generation algorithm that builds parts of the layout out of small elements instead of just D3's huge screen-filling tiles. (cf. Diablo 1, 2, Path of Exile, and countless roguelikes. For a technical summary of how this can be implemented,** there is an easier way to partially ameliorate this problem: simply add new layouts using the existing tiles, but would simply make better use of existing resources.

* **Collision Detection** - Being ""meleed"" by a monster that is nowhere near you is bad design. It doesn't look right, 2, or many other games. There should be a ""sanity check"" on enemy melee attacks: If you are more than X yards away when the attack animation *lands* (rather than *starts*), it should not count as a hit. If this makes some monsters insufficiently threatening, then just speed up their attack animation, instead of giving them long-distance telekinetic punching powers.

* **Lack of endgame objectives** - Players need something to do in PvE, like an endless dungeon or wave-based survival mode. Whatever it is, it should be heavily randomized for replayability, and increasingly difficult so as to keep endgame players challenged.

-

**SOCIAL**

* **Incognito Mode** - The option to appear as invisible is a basic feature of almost every messaging service - except this one. The developers have mentioned concerns about whether this feature would desocialize players. This is the wrong perspective entirely; this feature is about basic respect for your customers' right to privacy, if you want to be left alone while you play, you deserve that right.

* **Matchmaking** - The matchmaking system is much less flexible than the named-game approach of Diablo 2, very frustrating. Also, it becomes useless for the 99% of your time you ultimately spend farming instead of progressing, when there is no way to identify farming partners for particular routes, class combinations, or similar gear quality. Instead, players should be able to create and view games with specific names. Allow players to decide for themselves what they want to do

* **Customization** - Diablo 3's artists designed many very beautiful armor sets for each class. You wouldn't know it

* **Custom Channels** - It would be very beneficial to the social aspect of the game if it was possible for clans

-

**MISC**

* Many players have decried that the story will never be fixed, by far, is the Scooby-Doo level dialogue where major villains (Azmodan and Diablo) will constantly call you up to remind you of what you're going to do next by telling you you'll never do it. Such dialogue destroys their credibility as villains and undermines the tone of the story. But really, it's not intended to make the story good, it's just intended as an indirect tutorial for the dimmest players. So consider this: cut out those lines if the player has tutorial tips turned off. That's what those lines are, anyway (e.g., ""You'll never destroy the Rift Oculus over there! &lt;pssst- go destroy that Rift Oculus!&gt;"" - it just makes Diablo sound like an incompetent idiot.) A player who is experienced enough to manually turn off tutorial tips doesn't need to hear this

* **Video Options** - Contrast and Brightness sliders are needed, and does not do justice to Diablo 3's beautiful artwork.

* **Resplendent Chests** should drop a rare for players with 5 NV stacked. This avoids any swapping or abuse concerns. It's not fun for resplendent chests to be garbage cans.

1338863425.0,uldxs,Notes on playing a Demon Hunter in Inferno,not_a_haddock,410,85,414,"I think that a lot of people would benefit from the collective Diablo wisdom that we have all built up over the last few weeks. This post is a list of things that I have noticed and used to help me play in Inferno difficulty as a Demon Hunter. This isn't an exhaustive guide of everything you need to know

**Gear**

As many people have noted

This means that the most valuable offensive stats are Dexterity, in *roughly* that order depending on your current build. You can disregard Dexterity on your weapon, however: go for the highest DPS you can afford. If you can get some +Crit Damage on it too, great (this can be achieved with an Emerald in a weapon socket too).

In terms of defensive stats

* The first is +% Movement Speed. This will really help you both kite and avoid projectiles. The cap is 25%, etc.
* The second is +Max Discipline. The glass-cannon DH really relies on defensive abilities to survive, you can increase the number of successive casts from 2 to 3 (with Preparation this is 4 to 6). Furthermore, by maxing out your Disc (+10 on both cloak and quiver) you can achieve 4 successive casts! This will allow you a lot more flexibility in your defensive options and is something I really recommend to all aspiring DHs - it is not too expensive, either (I got my cloak and quiver for ~500k with decent Dex on both)
* Finally



**Skills**

I don't intend on running through the nuances of every available rune (there are other places to find this info) - simply my thoughts on useful skills:

* **Smoke Screen** is pretty much a must-have in order to survive any non-trivial encounter. Most people use Lingering Fog (even post-nerf) because that extra .5 seconds often allows an extra few yards of escape or another heavily damaging shot. Also extremely useful for avoiding damage from Arcane sentries, Plague, fire floors etc etc etc. All rounder.
* **Caltrops** aid kiting and damage-dealing (depending on your rune). I have found the most success with the Stun rune when in a fix, not when it fires. This means that you can throw down five traps with 100% crit chance - and they proc often.~~ **Nerfed :(** The main difficulty is in getting them down at the right time and place.
* **Vault** is a great escape skill and fairly cheap in Disc
* **Preparation** is SS's partner in crime, rather than being consistently slightly better.
* **Companion** is widely used with the Bat rune for Hatred regen
* **Marked for Death** also has potential for Hatred-regen
* **Impale** can do serious damage with the +100% crit rune
* **Rain of Vengeance** is a great offensive CC skill costing no resource with a decent CD of 30s. With Flying Strike you can stun even act bosses
* **Hungering Strike** is the primary of choice for a lot of DHs
* **Entangling Shot** is the more defensive alternative Hatred generator
* **Elemental Arrow** is great with Nether Tentacles. Slow-moving projectiles that act as AoE and can proc multiple times on the same enemy
* **Evasive Fire** is a skill that I used early on then didn't consider again because it didn't feel powerful or useful enough. I've taken advice in this thread and trialed it, but EF is even better than HS *and* hits multiple enemies. I've also been told that it fires through thin walls, which I have yet to try but it sounds very useful. Not sold on the backflip just yet but in theory it synergises well with Tactical Advantage, which is nice.

The above covers all of the frequently used skills and why they're good. Now

* **Tactical Advantage** is the first passive available and one of the best. Smoke Screen and Vault get a huge boost by increasing their primary ability: getting you out of trouble.
* **Steady Aim** is essentially a free +20% damage boost if you play conservatively and keep your distance. However
* **Cull the Weak** has uses on a slowing build
* **Archery** gives a really nice damage boost
* **Sharpshooter** is found on a lot of DHs. ~~It is a lot more useful than it first appears, all of those NTs have a 100% chance to crit, for every proc (can be up to 3 times on large bosses). Boom!~~ **Apparently this was nerfed in the latest patch! Might have better luck with other passives and stacking crit; time will tell**

I think that about covers what I've learnt about playing Demon Hunter so far

Hello everyone, I will try and use a spoiler tag.  With that said, let just dive into the events and fascinating twists and turns of Diablo 2, and hopefully, ~~the Lord of Destruction expansion pack!~~ It got way too long, so I will be breaking that off into another post. The post was too long to all fit in the header, please check the comments for Act III and IV (I know asking for upvotes of any kind is wrong, so I don't get any sort of Krama

###Prologue
    
At the end of Diablo I, King Leoric’s eldest son](/spoiler), had become the Dark Wanderer.  He impaled the soulstone into his forehead and carried Diablo’s spirit within him.  He struggled with the demon and fought to control his own body, but Diablo was too strong and quickly corrupted our hero.  

*“Many moons have passed since I left the town of Tristram behind me. Since then I've tried to forget the terrors I beheld beneath the cold earth, assuring me that my salvation lies within the ruins of ancient kingdoms. Though I know the way, I know not what perils will arise to hinder my journey, and as I pass through the first gate, I know that the better part of my soul will remain behind… forever.”*

###Opening Cinematic

The [opening cinematic for Diablo II]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0kPXdtz_c4) introduces us to Marius, except Marius.  He is spared once again.  Compelled by Diablo’s calling, Marius followed the Dark Wanderer as he travels further East.

*""Why did I follow him...? I don't know. Why do things happen as they do in dreams? All I know is that, East. Always... into the East.""*

###Act I – The Sightless Eye

We are then taken in game and pick one of the 5 heroes to play as.  The story goes that the heroes traveled as a group, a camp made by the survivors of the Rogue Monastery on the outskirts of Khanduras.  The heroes are tasked with clearing out the evils in the surrounding area and to save the last Horadrim, Deckard Cain (yayyyyy).  The passage through the Rogue Monastery must be cleared before we can travel east, as this is the only passage through the mountains.  However, it is currently being guarded by [Andariel , the Maiden of Anguish](http://i.imgur.com/Eb3Kq.jpg).  She was put here to guard the passage and keep anyone from following Diablo.  Andariel is defeated after traversing through the Monastery halls clearing out the countless demons, and we continue onward

###Act II – The Secret of the Vizjerei

We reach Lut Gholein and realize that this city too, killing and taking what they find.  After clearing out the sewers, the heroes consult with Lord of Lut Gholein and his Wizard Drognan to conclude that the Dark Wanderer is really Diablo and he is seeking the long lost Tomb of Tal Rasha, somewhere in the desert.  

[Diablo seeks to free his brother, the Horadric Staff must be reassembled, as this is the key to chamber in which Baal has laid dormant for over two centuries.  The heroes search the endless desert to reassemble the staff, and ventures into the Arcane Sanctuary, an ethereal realm, to find the where about of Tal Rasha’s Tomb.   After defeating [The Summoner]( http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/The_Summoner) and finding Horazon’s Journal,  it is revealed that the tomb is concealed in the Canyon of The Magi.  

The heroes rushed to the tomb with urgency to stop Diablo from freeing Baal, [Duriel, the Lord/Prince of Pain](http://i.imgur.com/ALESN.jpg).  His icy attacks chilled our heroes to the bone, but by this point, they had grown strong [with some epic loot and rare magic find (OP as shit right?)](/spoiler).   After Duriel is defeated, the heroes enter Baal chamber to find Tyrael constrained by chains that once held the now cunning and sly Baal (it is said that when Tal Rasha plunged the soulstone into his chest and imprisoned Baal within him, he passed onto Baal all his intellect and knowledge).  The heroes free Tyrael as he reveals [what had happened merely days before]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdgwRT5dLt8).  The Dark Wanderer and his follower Marius had entered the tomb to free Baal.  Tryrael descended from the Heavens to stop Diablo, Marius was drawn to Baal, Marius fed the tomb with Baal’s soulstone fragment and headed toward the Temple of Light.  Now alone, Mephisto

1359736818.0,17p8tr,Tal Rasha's set bonuses need fixing: Here's why. Please support PTR thread.,Coxis67,420,93,107,"Hey people. Wizard player here since launch. I have been advocating for a change in Tal Rasha's set for a while now. I'm no D3 expert nor theorycrafter

http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/7710222369?page=1

Tal Rasha's set bonuses:
2pc: Fire skills do 3% more damage.
3pc: Lighting skills do 3% more damage.
4pc: Cold skills deal 3% more damage.
Increases Arcane Power Regeneration by 2.00 per Second (Wizard Only)

I will post here the inconsistencies with the set.

1- This is probably the biggest inconsistency. Why was this decided, Tal Rasha's. For some unknown reason to us, Tal Rasha's helm is NOT a wizard hat. This means that it's the only set with only one class-only item, when the rest of them have two. This may not sound so bad at first, but when we put it in perspective, our class-set is denying us (and no other class) of our class-only affixes, which means our helm can NOT roll with +Arcane Power or Arcane Power on Crit. (Reference: IK: Mighty Weapon and Mighty Belt. -- Zuni: Voodoo Mask and Mojo. -- Natalya's: Hand Crossbow and Cape. Inna's: Spirit Stone and Daibo. Tal Rasha's: ONLY the Source.)

2- The set bonuses are not similar to those of the Triumvirate, but only to those particular elemental skills, which is ridiculous. We'd gladly take Zuni's 1st and 2nd bonus if we could.

3- The set bonuses from all other sets are better for their class (and even Wizards), +All Resist, 3rd is WD-only, not relevant). The part that should be an eye-opener is that many (if not most, I can't be sure) choose to use the 1st and sometimes 2nd bonus of Zuni's set, rather than Tal Rasha's. A smaller group chooses to go with Nat's 1st bonus, 7% crit. All of which result in a greater benefit to us than those of our own class set. The only other set that's almost as broken as ours is Inna's. Before you say it's worse... You guys -at least- get 130 Dex and you get both your class helm and weapon. We don't even get that. Monks are in a very bad place too. :(

4- The bonuses on Tal Rasha's and other gear

This is a list of Wizard elemental skills:

Spells that deal Cold damage:
Ray of Frost (215%
Frost Nova - Frozen Mist (160% over 8 seconds
Meteor - Comet (312% + 72% over 3 seconds
Blizzard (210% over 6 seconds
Ice Armor - Frozen Storm (30% over 3 seconds
Hydra - Frost Hydra (36%

Spells that deal Fire damage:
Shock Pulse - Fire Bolts (152% x 3
Hydra (28%
Meteor (260% + 60% over 3 seconds

Spells that deal Lightning damage:
Shock Pulse (105% x 3
Electrocute (90%
Hydra - Lightning Hydra (64%
Storm Armor (100%
Magic Weapon - Electrify (10%

Of our bonuses, as it doesn't proc Conflagrate. 

As you can see in the PTR thread

I've recently noticed that I don't need Force Armor in Act 1 or 2 any longer - which is great fun :)

Stats-wise I went from:
**18k HP, to:
**41k HP

* **Always** equip gear with Magic Find right before an elite pack or boss goes down. Do the same for chests.

* Run speed is a must. 12% on shoes a minimum (worth dropping a lot of DPS for)

* Resistances seem to be useless in the amounts I've tried out (up to 450). I still get one shot without Force Armor. So

* Have enough HP in Act 3 so that your Force Armor keep working properly. For me the magic barrier were at 32k HP. Some attacks will kill you through Force Armor though

* Diablo is easier with &gt; 40k HP

* Gold-wise, netting you even more.

* There's also a Resplendant Chest with 50% spawn rate in Act 3 The Keep Depths Level 1. There are three (3) different map layouts

**Belial guide**
---------------------------

I grinded Belial for two full nights. That was possibly the toughest fight together with Diablo. There are two ways to go on that fight. For a wizard the hard part is phase 1 and 2.

One way is to have a lot of dps and just tear through Belial before he spawns his adds in Phase 2. I could not do that (my gear was way too bad) so I had to do the other way.

Second way is with Hydra (Venom) and Blizzard (Snowbound). I ran from one side of the arch to the other while kiting the adds. I did not focus on Belial at all, but after a while you'll get the running back and forth down.

Phase 3 was the hard phase before Inferno

* Attack 1 (green circle to the right of you): Belial will hit the ground where the circle is. As soon as it hits

* Attack 2 (green circle on you): Run to the right

* Attack 3 (breath from right side to left): This is why you are standing on the right side. Belial will stretch a bit and lift both his arms to the side. You should already be running as far right as you can. If you do it right you won't take any damage.

* Meteor AOE: I start by standing out by the fence, then you have to change direction to get to where he struck in time.

During all of this

My best tip is to go do him on Nightmare or Hell difficulty. Do Phase 3 without damaging him (remove your Templar) and keep doing it for 20 minutes until you have it down and not taking any damage at all. Then you will feel much more confident when you hit Phase 3 on Inferno.

12% run speed on boots is a must in Phase 3.

This guy do Phase 3 really well: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=A6ZrnR4TejE#t=89s

-----------------------------


-----------------------------
**Diablo guide**
-----------------------------

Alright

The fight was between 12 to 14 minutes long. You can't rush it too much.

I changed my build by adding Slow Time (Perpetuity rune)

-----------------------------
**Phase 1**
-----------------------------

-- Attack 1 (one fireball toward you): This one hits the ground where you are standing doing massive damage and also creates an aoe with a wide area of effect. It's even bigger than the graphic circle on the ground

You deal with it like this:

* You are running and he misses you.
* You teleport away.
* You throw up Slow Time and smile at the opportunity to DPS the hell out of him with Magic Missile. 
* You have one of those rocks between you and he hit the rock.
* You use Diamond Skin

-- Attack 2 (multiple fireballs in all directions): This attack is easier to avoid

* You deal with this attack the same way as you deal with the first one.

-- Attack 3 (bone prisons): This is easy to avoid

* Run around and take the opportunity to either DPS him (look at the ground

-- Attack 4 (teleport &amp; strike): This attack is annoying as hell but not that lethal unless you get his more dangerous melee debuff.

There's three different debuffs that you might get.

The first one increase the melee damage you get for a while

The second one reduces your healing with 50% for a while

The third one is the dangerous one. It puts a dot on you that will do around 3000 damage every second until it times out or you get to a Healing Well.

The teleport + melee attack will either:

* Miss you because you are running (run speed on shoes anyone?)
* Miss you because you teleport away
* Miss you because you dodge
* Do no damage because you use Diamond Skin
* Do damage
* Do damage and debuff you

The tactics for Phase 1 is to keep one of the two holes with rocks between you and Diablo. Let your Hydra spew on him and lob your Seeker Magic Missiles around the rock. Be wary with angles so his fireballs don't pass the rock and kill you. When he teleports close

When you get debuffed with the dot, Teleport to the Healing Well and stop it, then change side to the one with a full Healing Well. Rinse and repeat.

-----------------------------
**Phase 2**
-----------------------------

This phase isn't that hard actually. The dangerous part is to have your Shadow spawn on top of you and one shot you. When you notice that the shadow will spawn, the Hydra will do it alone if you like to.

When Diablo is around

-----------------------------
**Phase 3**
-----------------------------

-- Attack 5 (electricity-flame spew): Diablo roars flames after you.

* Always keep your distance and they are no trouble. Teleport if you have to run through them.

Compared to the other phases this is a cakewalk. DIABLO NO LONGER TELEPORTS! YAY! Just run back and forth and keep an eye on him on the minimap. Put out your hydra and let it grind him down. Teleport away from his new attack. Don't rush it

Good luck!

1336321720.0,t9tje,Diablo III Release - Survival Guide for Marathon Gaming,LethalFrag,444,124,230,"I know many of us are excited for Diablo III's release and will be spending massive amounts of time playing as soon as the game comes out. Many of us have taken time off of work or will be spending every waking moment that we have available playing. I am writing this guide to help the community here at r/diablo get the most out of their play time.

For some background

**What you will need:**

- 1 gallon jug of water
- Apple/Orange or a 100% juice beverage of your choice
- Pre cooked
- Healthy snacks
- Caffeinated beverages

**1. Stay Hydrated**

Dehydration is the number one cause of making your body feel sluggish

**2. Eat Smart**

Your body constantly churns energy to keep itself going

**Get up and move**

While it's hard to peel yourself away from a game that you have been anticipating for over a decade

**Sugar/Caffeine**

We all love energy drinks, but 12 hours later you will be crashing.

As a general rule

**Summary**

We all want to get the most out of our play time upon release. Ordering a pizza and grabbing a case of mt dew will be a great way to start the marathon. But after your first gaming session you will go to sleep feeling like crap

Plan ahead

As the Witch Doctor stands against the ever-popular Demon Hunter:


* Less damage than DH
* Less survivability than DH
* More CC than DH


That being said, invulnerable minions, reflects damage, vortex, or teleport, nor does it help against Lashers/general ranged mobs/leapers.


Another problem I see is ""successful"" clearing/farming strategies on the Witch Doctor.


Note: I am fully aware that these strategies are successful and result in items/clears/whatever it is that you're after.


""Viable"" Act III/IV Inferno strategies mostly consist of running into melee range to overrun enemies with the 5 seconds of survivability WDs are given using Zombie Bears


This strategy forces the usage of a passive meant to save one from death


Building tanky on the WD means that there is no significant damage output


Building glass cannon on the WD means that you get one-shot


This next point is minor and is mostly fixed with attack speed: DHs and Wizards cast one shot and sidestep


All summons get one-shot.


Using the ""Viable"" DPS strategy, yet it sees more success than a standard WD kiting build, as the WD dies at a comparable frequency when played as a ranged class as intended; this is because less results are yielded when the WD is played normally, as there's less damage for equal risk.


It's still mostly possible to clear Inferno using a standard kite-splinter build


Even optimally


I'm missing the part where this makes my class ""too good""


Again, trying different builds, and attempting to learn all the ins and outs of WD.

1337713139.0,tznyq,Here's What's Wrong with Diablo 3 (Constructive Criticism),,500,186,477,"Let me start by saying that I am enjoying the game so far

* 1)  I understand wanting to make the game hard, when combined, make them invincible/unkillable (or make it so that you have to kite for 15 minutes)? Not fun.
       
To expand on point #1, so save it for when you get walled), Morter (because you have to clump up or you are dead), Arcane Enchanted (dodging the lasers has a Mario-esque feel to it), Illusion (because it's just interesting, and can make AOE spells more fun and useful), Vortex (again


NOT FUN:  Shielding (""it's just invincible for most of the time?  so, but within reason.  Same goes for Vampiric.  It just draws the fights out.  Diablo should be about killing lots of monsters, each one taking little time.  Not killing a few monsters over the course of 10 minutes.  That feels a lot more like an MMORPG I used to play....


So in general, where we have to adopt a new movement pattern or save a certain skill in order to avoid dying.  If the combination of attributes makes a pack of elites IMPOSSIBLE to kill, that's certainly quite difficult, but not fun at all as far as I'm concerned.  I think Blizzard could get more creative on the attributes and combinations of attributes, such that they can be extremely difficult but still doable once a player learns how to avoid the damage.  Learning to avoid multiple attributes at the same time could prove extremely fun, rewarding, and still extremely difficult.  But right now I find myself skipping certain combinations


* Where's the mind control


* Where are the slow-moving projectiles that require you to stop what you're doing and dance?  Similar to Azmodan's fireball.  Remember Diablo's red lightning in D2?  That kind of thing!  We don't have enough of that from elite packs.  It's usually just unavoidable.

* Why isn't there a ""Summoner"" attribute


* Why not an attribute where the elites flash red for 2 seconds


* Another idea:  Give elite packs certain class-specific vulnerabilities to encourage party-play. Eg ""Takes +25% damage from Arcane damage"" (shit! we need a wizard)


Every single attribute should leave room for players to make a **choice** in order to stay alive.  And that choice shouldn't just be ""fuck this pack, but Blizzard didn't even attempt it.  It's rather sad.  They just made inferno monsters have a TON of health and hit for a TON of damage.  Where's the fun in that?  There should be a dynamic beyond just picking your skills and grinding for items.


* 2)  Loot at low levels is boring.  Where's the Sigon's?  Where's the Treads?  Where are all the quickly-outgrown, Nightmare, and Hell on my Wizard and never saw a single set or unique item.  I understand that's an anecdotal example, and I understand wanting to make sets/uniques very rare so as to not trivialize them, but within reason.


* 3)  What is the point of waypoints if I can't go forward to the next act or backward to a previous one?  Blizzard emphasized wanting to maximize players' time spent killing monsters, in my opinion, extremely annoying.  I'm sure they had good reasons for this, but they're not good enough to justify the inconvenience to players.  Once I beat the game, I should be able to explore it freely without having to go back to the main menu and remake.


* 4)  Chat channels:  A lot has been said on this already


* 5)  The auction house:  Why can't I access it in-game

* 6) No in-game voice chat?

As someone who has played all of the blizzard games, all the news about Diablo III certainly was a shock. But after watching all the Jay Wilson interview videos, and actually hear their reasoning behind the changes they've decided on, things now make a lot more sense.

Looking back at when Diablo 2 first came out, but the changes they made, made sense at the time. And all the changes to D3, at this current time, make sense. I get that with the online thing, there're people that are now not going to be able to enjoy the game. But the greedy part of me is going to love the hell of all the benefits of online-only.

The app provides a quick way to check in details anyone's profile using it's Diablo 3 battleTag. As it's my first iPhone app ever it might not be perfect and I'm open to any suggestions!

As it is for now you can check for any BattleTag :
* All equipped items.
* Selected active and passive skills.
* Current statistics.

An extra tab with maximum values per item for valuable stats has been added to help you choose your equipment.

[Here is the link to the AppStore](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mobile-armory-for-diablo-3/id557892322) if not working the app name is Mobile Armory - for Diablo 3.

The next version is already under development and will feature:
* Favorites for battletags
* Parangon levels

Oh yeah

Thank you!

After seeing yet another post about how druids could work in D3, but pretty much every standard fighter-y archetype is covered by the barbarian.

So here is my attempt at a plausibly strength based class, but the concepts are there. Apologies for the long post, I got a little carried away with my ideas.

TL;DR: It's a person sharing a body with a demon **and** an angel, and new version of Armageddon/Fissure. And Fist of the Heavens comes back.

&gt; **The Backstory.**

Tal Rasha was most famous amongst the Horadrim not just for his leadership

Millenia before the Horadrim and even the dark exile, each rousing their followers to war. Eventually this would lead to the discovery of Sanctuary and Inarius's imprisonment by the Prime Evils, but the conflict was not stopped. Angels and demons still strode the world, and the Nephalem, made weak by the retuned Worldstone, could barely stand before them.

The Nephalem, was lost trying to learn the lore of the Worldstone to save the Nephalem.

In their darkest hour, but this much is known; within a few decades, all the supernatural beings left in sanctuary were bound in this way. In each volunteer, the Nephalem bound a single angel and a solitary demon, hoping that their conflict would prevent them escaping the host.

The Nephalem could not kill those carrying such burdens; to do so, and imprisoned the possessed within them. Sealed far below, the nephalem believed that they would remain undisturbed, forever.

With the turmoil of recent events, many were not so lucky. Those that remain now wander the world they once gave so much to save, hoping that once again, they will there in the darkest hour.

&gt; **Gameplay:**

The possessed have little need of dexterity

Their resource is called Essence, similar to a Demon Hunter's two different resources. However, the way each resource is generated is through spending the other (e.g. if you spend 5 Light Essence, you regain 5 Dark Essence). Instead of simply regenerating or degenerating like normal resources, the resources continually move towards being balanced (i.e. the one that's at less than half regenerates, whereas the other degenerates). Upon spawning in, each resource is already half full. This means that even if you had a build purely of spending one resource, albeit not as efficiently as someone using a more balance mixture.

*Please, don't let your complaints about D3 lead you to promote D2's worst gameplay elements.*

D3's Auction House is a huge change to the genre.  By lowering the barriers of trade, it becomes less unlikely to find good gear on your own during progression, if you've been using the AH.

The problem is not the RMAH

The problem is not entirely the mere presence of the AH, and MF swapping is even rarer).

The problem is not that ""drops are bad"".  It is statistics

However, which is clearly aiming for the D2 crowd, has...

- Very limited respecs

- FFA loot

- Excessive inventory Tetris (i.e. bosses that drop 3x what can fit in your inventory).

- A pure barter system

- ID system; everything is unidentified

Honestly, when it could be better on D3 on the back of its gameplay systems and end-game mechanics, rather than by making the interface cumbersome and punishing experimentation.

 Now that we've ignored your feedback for months and we aren't making as much money on the RMAH as we hoped

 We've had an enormous amount of complaints since the launch. I speak for everyone at Blizzard when I say that you are loud and annoying and we hate you. We truly believe ""Every Dollar Matters

 The launch week of Diablo III was obviously a debacle. The positive was that we made nine-hundred trillion dollars

 The launch had many challenges, our logistical incompetence in meeting demand and our unwillingness to spend the money necessary to ensure that we only ""double it"" when it comes to untested game mechanics, never to hardware infrastructure. However, I do not wish to apologize for the misstep--after all, it wasn't us who crashed our servers for three days straight. You did that. We will do our absolute minimum to conquer this for future releases if we feel like it.

 In response to the immediate and overwhelming demand for a faithful followup to Diablo II, I'll just say that even as we work to drive you away from the game and into the less-hardware-intensive Auction Houses, it's a sure bet your hardcore characters will die from lag spikes and server outages. We hope that our actions in the past have demonstrated that above all else, we're committed to keeping you paying for anything we make, no matter how rotten and cynical it actually is. Have faith and you will be rewarded. With $5.

 We are not satisfied with only making nine-hundred trillion dollars; we want people to continue paying for Blizzard games for a very long time. The Diablo III team has made a passable

 You've seen some of that work already in patch 1.0.7, but we would realistically like to get that number up to five. Maybe six. Per class. Another topic we’ve seen actively discussed is the fact that better, more distinct Legendary items are needed. We agree. I have no explanation whatsoever for why a lot of legendary items have been useless for months, but Patch 1.0.8 will include new and improved Legendary items that are more interesting, more powerful, and more epic in ways you probably (hopefully) won’t be expecting, like extra frost damage or reflects damage back at attacker.

 We're also working on a number of features that already exist, we will be constantly improving the auction house since we know that's like super duper important to you all. This is how your money is being used. Thought you should know.

 Regarding the real-money auction house, had a stroke and the part of his brain that makes game design decisions leaked out his ears and into his cereal. Also, Ned has a hard time eating cereal anymore because the brains made him sick. Pray for Ned, please. 

Anyway, of course, be going to for items you couldn't find in-game because of Ned and his bad choices. It was never our intention for you to feel like the auction house is mandatory, so stop feeling like that. What are you, an idiot? We did it for your own good! Now you understand and we can all move on together.

 One other common topic we’ve seen in the forums is the always-connected experience, we would like to divert your attention to this cute bunny: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Rabbit_in_montana.jpg

 Diablo III's always-connected requirement is necessary for, please email us. It's also necessary for us to support you playing with your friends (even if you don't have any), because we don't want you doing that yourself via a LAN. LANs are scary. A LAN once ate my friend. It's true. Look it up.

 I know many of you are also looking forward to patch 1.1, the arena PvP we will provide will create a wonderful, controlled and constrained arena combat experience which will satisfy WoW players, which seems to be our primary demographic for some weird reason. For now, you can just accept brawling as our apology for the shit we stepped in.

 We're also doing some other things and stuff. It's going to be awesome. We can't give out any specifics but get excited!

 As always

 Always yours my sweet

1342636027.0,wrt3n,Magic find does not affect affix count of rares,JohnnyLeven,498,197,245,"## Data collection:

Population 1: Rares that drop from boss kills with 0% mf and 0 NV stacks

Population 2: Rares that drop from boss kills with 234% mf and 0 NV stacks

**Sample 1:**

200 runs of Warrior's Rest Inferno with 0% mf and 0 NV stacks while only picking up drops that came specifically from the boss kill Data:

Rares found = 71

4 affix rares found = 41

5 affix rares found = 26

6 affix rares found = 4

**Sample 2:**

200 runs of Warrior's Rest Inferno with 234% mf and 0 NV stacks while only picking up drops that came specifically from the boss kill Data:

Rares found = 214

4 affix rares found = 131

5 affix rares found = 68

6 affix rares found = 15

Affix count was determined using the recent exploit found to view the item chat data again.

**Excel Spreadsheet:**  http://www.mediafire.com/view/?4cjjbij91xafua1

**Noteworty observations:**

* The boss kill never dropped damaged (grey) equipment (even with 0% mf).  This could suggest that the final elite kill drops from a separate drop table.

* The boss kill always dropped 3 or 4 equippable items (average of 3.5075 drops per boss kill)

* There wasn't a single 3 affix item that dropped.  Do they exist besides from crafts?

## Statistical Test to compare two population proportions:

H0:p2 = p1

HA:p2 &gt; p1

Where p1 is the true population proportion of 5 or 6 affix rares from boss kills with 0% mf and 0 NV stacks
and p2 is the true population proportion of 5 or 6 affix rares from boss kills with 234% mf and 0 NV stacks

alpha = .1

n1 = 71

n2 = 214

p1hat = (26+4)/71 = .4225

p2hat = (68+15)/214 = .3879

phat = (26+4+68+15)/(71+214) = .3965

**Test Statistic:**

Z = (p2hat - p1hat)/sqrt(phat*(1 - phat)*(1/n1 + 1/n2))

Z = (.3879 - .4225)/sqrt(.3965*.6035*(1/71 + 1/214))

Z = -0.5165

Z~N(0

p-value = P(Z &gt; -0.5165) = .6972

Our p-value &gt;&gt; alpha

## Other notes:

The same holds true for magic items.

If we assume that the proportion of 4

**Magic items:**

* 1 affix (0.0696

* 2 affix (0.8766

**Rare items:**

* 4 affix (0.5361

* 5 affix (0.2650

* 6 affix (0.0323

## Still todo:

It's still possible that mf affects affix count from nv guaranteed rares or from normal mob drops.  I will be collecting data on that in the future.

Please let me know if I'm not thinking of something or if you see any erros in my calculations/thought process.

## EDIT:

First of all I want to say thank you to everyone that has commented and brought up things that I had not considered.

I'd like to collect more data to get a more definitive understanding of exactly how mf affects drops and this conversation seems like a good starting point.  

I wish I could change my title at this point

I did a few more calculations and my data can only really say that

There is not nearly enough data here to rule out the situation described by Stasis5001.


I know I can't collect enough data myself and if anyone would be willing to do runs in the way I did for my data collection to help get a larger data set it would be beneficial to everyone.  If you collect any data

Here is an Auto Hot Key script I used to quickly copy the item chat data to notepad:

The script is written for playing in windowed (fullscreen) mode with an open text file named ""Items found.csv"" as the first window selected on alt-tab.

In Diablo 2

* Imbue a weapon of your choice at the blacksmith. You would find a good quality white weapon and the blacksmith would make it rare

* Gain a skill point 

* Gain 5-10 stat points

* The Horadric Cube, craft different items, upgrade gems and so on. Pretty much the same functions that Haedrig and Covetus serve.

* Mephistos soulstone which

* Adding a socket to an item.

* Adding your own name to an item.

* Receiving a scroll of resistance that added a permanent +10 to all resistances.

* Receiving a health potion that added a permanent +20 HP.

* Sometimes quests would give you a rare item. One would give you a rare ring. 

* And of course the different followers.

Now, hell). So, while all of these rewards weren't always  useful, they were definitely fun and made the quests so much more interesting to complete. There was even a point in making a character just for certain quest rewards (like the added sockets, smashing mephistos soulstone and imbuing a weapon at hell difficulty). These rewards were also sometimes used when trading. Like ""You get the drops from destroying mephistos soulstone if you boost me"" or something similar.

Those type of rewards made the gaming experience much better and more interesting. You actually looked forward to completing certain quests because of the rewards. Now it feels as if you need to get through

Random events stand out to me as the biggest end game content failure in Diablo 3. The rewards are not good enough

Why varying rarity?
--------------------
First, the most rare can be the most difficult. But that doesn't mean difficulty variation has to be dramatic. We need to experience common random events with below avg rewards, rare events with good rewards.. and extremely rare events with amazing rewards. This will keep us feeling satisfied and excited when the most rare events happen.

Why better rewards?
--------------------
There needs to be an incentive to do the actual event

Why random locations are important?
--------------------
A random event does not require a physical location. It does not have to be a door that opens in a structure that always exists on the game map. It can be an NPC that opens a portal, letting the player know that a random event is in the area. This doesn't have to show up on the map, it could just be a friendly notice. It shouldn't be instantaneous, then people will just waypoint around the map then creating a new game. Maybe after you kill an elite pack in the zone?

A chart that displays each act and difficulty. The yellow portion is what I'm guessing is Blizzard's ideal leveling curve.

Expanded explanation;

This chart provides you with how much experience your character will receive when killing monsters in certain areas. The ""Min"", average (rounded), and highest monster levels in the act. So if you are level 50 and kill a level 50 monster, you get 100% of the exp, change your level to 60 when killing the level 50 monster and you get 0% of the exp.

* char level +10 or more of monster level = 0%
* +9 = 1% (+exp effects nullified)
* +8 = 5% (+exp effects nullified)
* +7 = 15% (+exp effects nullified)
* +6 = 30% (+exp effects nullified)

Therefore we had around 2000 Unid Ammys. So this past weekend we did a fundraiser with those unid ammys


The end result was astonishing

Here's the breakdowns, around $900 of which were pure donations, and the rest were payments for set auctions and ammy auctions ($160 for a barb set, $120 for a wizard set, 5$ charity uber carries and some other stuff as well). We also received about 1 Billion in game gold for auctions and raffles. Instead of selling them on the RMAH and having Blizzard taking a big bite out of it, I decided to convert it to cash myself by buying the gold with $444 USD for a grand total of $1836.   

Top Three Donors:

Vincent W.: $409 USD

Issac K. $222.22 USD

Jason P. $90 USD


The final amount was evenly divided to the two charities with 918.4 USD to each.

I was able to donate directly to [Child's Play](http://charityauction.chipin.com/charity-auction)

I am very glad and proud that the diablo 3 community both on twitch and this subreddit were able to unite and make this charitable act a reality.

Edit: Cross-posted with another good guide

Here's what I do

**Statistics:** 1 run takes me ~35 minutes, ilvl 61-62 rare armor, excuisite essences, and perhaps most interestingly rare rings and amulets.

I use a wizard with wormhole teleport to move quickly speed and 195% base MF. I use a shield to minimize ""oh @*#(^#"" moments and still kill fast enough

**item Pick-up philosophy:** Too many trips to town can kill run speed. I pick up all ilvl 61+ items

**Guide:**

Step 0) Start a game using ""The Imprisoned Angel - The Cursed Hold"" quest per a normal butcher run. Once the game starts, and 0-1 treasure goblins) re-make the game. If it did spawn, we'll come back with 5 stacks (since treasure goblins respond to stacks). 

Edit: here's a pic of what to look for. It's often a bit further from the WP

Step 1) Go to the festering woods. There are 2 guaranteed small dungeons with a champion pack in each. You should find at least 1 champion in the area. Town portal out and way point back in-between.

Step 2) With 2-3 (probably 3) stacks

Edit/update: A commenter says you can get guaranteed rares from the mini-quests in the crypts with 5 stacks

Step 3) WP to leoric's manner. Run through the manner (0-1 packs) and outside. The courtyard has a guaranteed pack.

Step 4) Butcher run as normal. You'll get several packs

Step 5) WP back to the northern highlands and clear the watch tower.

Step 6) Optional - go to each other WP and check for very close / obvious champion packs.

**A note on large areas:** As far as I know

**But what about act 3?**

I'm still not sure what the actual efficiency of act 1 vs. act 3 will be. Act 3 is **SO** much harder that it will always be slower and riskier. The drop rates are also only marginally better. I think the overwhelming majority of players,Discussion,False,self,t5_2qore,1340414697.0,secrettome,True

1340305400.0,ve8l7,A Diablo 3 Item Primer,DelphicProphecy,362,81,56,"After seeing quite a few people worried and confused about the stat changes to Attack Speed and possible future changes

The important thing to know about items is based on the following three terms:

* Item - What the item is
* Affix - Called properties in the crafting window. Blue almost always 1-3 of these. Rare always have 4-6 of these. They are things like ""of Pain"", this is why rings have half the stats of amulets.
* Mods - Affixes are actually a collection of one or more mods. For example, a mod is always only one additional thing where is an affix can be a grouping of things.

Since legendaries can have stats outside the range of normal items there Legendary Affixes and Mods that go outside the range and restrictions of the normal ones that rares can get.

Here's how an item is built when it drops. Some of this is informed guessing so if you know that it works differently for certain

* **Step 1**: An item type is chosen randomly based on the iLvl drop range and chances of the area. This includes both the category of item (gloves in this example) and the item type (name and iLvl). So if the game has decided to drop a pair of gloves it would then choose which gloves to drop out of all possible gloves in iLvl range 50-63 (assuming inferno act 1)
 * All possible gloves: http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/gloves/#type=common

 * Stats determined so far: iLvl
 * If you look at the crafted items you'll notice they have a single armor value instead of a range

* **Step 2**: Now the magical nature of the item is determined. This is the part where your magic find comes in. A calculation happens and the item either stays white, the higher chance of the item to drop as magic/rare/legendary.
 * If the item is white
 * If the item is blue
 * If the item is rare
 * If the item matches a base item of a Legendary (all legendaries have a white item that they are based on) then the appropriate static and random affixes are assigned to it.
 * Affixes are restricted by item type.
 * Stats determined so far: What the item will have a bonus to
 * For our example, Haste (Attack Speed), DR (Armor)

* **Step 3**: Once the item has had its affixes chosen

 * Dex affix for iLvl 61 has a range of 130-149
 * DexVit affix for iLvl 61 has a range of 39-124 for the Dex mod abd 39-124 for the Vit mod
 * Haste (Attack Speed) affix for iLvl 61 has a range of 6%-7% for the attack speed bonus mod
 * DR (Armor) affix for iLvl 61 has a range of 286-322 for armor bonus mod
 * Stats determined so far: All

* **Step 4**: Mods are combined into a single value
 * Total +Dex range becomes 169-273 which is a combination of two separate random rolls

Whew! That's a lot of random number generation. Fun fact

So now you're probably going. Okay

* When Blizzard nerfed attack speed
* When Blizzard improves legendary items they will likely make a number of changes. Remember that legendaries have a different set of affixes that they chose from for their ""special"" stats and also have a normal set of affixes too. http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/stone-gauntlets has a few static

 * If they chose to change the range of existing special affixes then those item values will be re-rolled affecting older items. This likely won't happen. Instead they will likely:
 * Change the ""blueprint"" of legendaries to use new better special affixes. Any new legendaries that drop will use these new better special affixes which may have a different set of mods or a higher range of them. Old items will not be affected as they will still have the old affixes assigned to them.
 * Change the ""blueprint"" of legendaries to have additional special or normal affixes. Any new legendaries that drop will have these additional special/normal affixes. Old item will not be affected as they have already been generated.

As you can see Blizzard doesn't really have control over existing items because which affixes were assigned to them and the range of values on those affixes is based on their seed value. Any change to these may re-roll the item and ruin it. They have to be very careful with item changes for this reason. They can change the ""blueprint"" of an item

This is a bit complex

(Edit) Additional Notes:

* You can only have one affix of each type per item. There are also likely other limitations that I'm not aware of.
* All 2 stat affixes such as DexVit
* Affixes levels are ""up to"" the iLvl of the item and are likely weighted to be closer to the iLvl but not necessarily at it

1342455586.0,wnduv,Diablo Inferno down with 2H DPS barb. Thoughts on game.,,526,254,295,"Disclaimer: Throughout this post


D3 is a game for hardcore gamers. When I'm feeling extremely critical of Blizzard, and is brought up regularly in the forums/reddit). Creating a game that is difficult in all of the right ways is a serious challenge. Diablo 3 is already a better game than what it was 2 months ago, and it does have a long way to go. But this thread was not created to bring up all of the areas that need to be improved with my own little twists. I want to point out what I've learned from playing this game, specifically in terms of having fun.


It's a hardcore game
----------
The trend in the industry is to dumb everything down so that it appeals to the casual player, I think too many people are comparing the D2 character grind years after launch. The game for most of the regulars involved getting rushed by your friends, having decent gear waiting for you at lvl 70 or so, and being able to farm Mephisto to some degree 4-8 hours after deciding on what your character was going to be. That's not to say we still didn't' have ""natural"" characters that relied only on gear found in the game, experiencing the full challenge of progression from normal to hell.

I am relieved that D3 exists. I am a hardcore gamer, but it's a challenge that is going to be further refined in the months to come.

tl;dr - I'm relieved that a game was released in 2012 for hardcore gamers.


Character Build
----------
Pick a character and style that fits your personality and stick with it. I'm a 2H DPS barb, 100vit and nothing else. Maybe some are 70+AR and strength. In time, you can start upgrading pieces to be AR/str/vit… then eventually AR/str/vit +MF or +piece specific attributes like crit or crit dmg.

The same goes for weapons. Lower damage high LOH gear is where you should start. You can also find amulets and rings that give LOH and not many other stats for cheap. When it comes to barbs, that's a great combination of stats and will be expensive, but you can survive Inferno with lower expectations. Or, in fact, have higher expectations as far as stat rolls but with less diversity on each piece.

tl;dr - Look/shop for blue gear that is high all resist and high 1 stat if you're poor and are looking to progress. Mix/match


Farming
----------
Magic find. NV stacks is a great addition to the Diablo series, get more MF. Once I could afford to buy MF for certain armor pieces, this totally changed my farming experience.

For my personality and 'real life' responsibilities, totally changed the enjoyment level for me.

tl;dr - Items still need some work.. legendaries are boring.. etc. etc. but as far as getting value out of your runs


Conclusion
----------
Blizz still has a long way to go


EDIT: There have been a lot of posts questioning me for calling this a hardcore game. I don't think the definition of 'hardcore' is universally agreed on. It can mean skill requirement, just because you can buy your way into faster progression doesn't make a game any less demanding.

2) Being able to barely beat Diablo inferno

3) I wanna try out weird builds with every class
weird gear specific to the weird build. All-thorns Monk. Ranged Barbarian. Melee Wizard.

4) PVP. Just because it's not out yet doesn't mean you can't start collecting gear for it. 

5) Beating inferno with a hardcore character. First I gear a softcore character well enough that he has little
risk of dying in Inferno Act IV. Then I play a hardcore character until it has the same stats as that softcore
character and beat inferno on hardcore. This will take a LOT of time.

* 3) Game creation.  I want Blizzard to ""open up"" the game world so that we can jump between Acts and actually use the waypoints that we've unlocked.  Give us free range over Sanctuary, REALLY important to me as a player.

Is the current level 60 grind getting you down?  Are you annoyed that you could farm with MF, I found an upgrade!” is basically gone, due to the way the AH “spoils” that adrenaline rush of finding your own gear? Are you sad that you are level 60, and are bored of the current endgame?

Are you sad that the game is so easy that it basically functions like this:  Grind and push nonstop until you hit inferno. Now farm there for the next 5 years.

Go make a Hardcore character. Seriously. Go do it and never look back.

**The normal mode auction house is the biggest problem with Diablo III. It is the root and source of all evil.**

Holy crap, here I am, telling you that the AH is everything that is wrong with Diablo. 

The thing is, you could trade for stuff, but basically, gear was the currency of the game, and to get currency, you had to have it drop for you. That created this psychological response anytime gear dropped, and that’s why you played the game. Diablo III has taken the heart and soul of Diablo II and turned it on it’s head.

Current Diablo III endgame revolves around farming gear, we would enter inferno with a 500 dps 2h weapon. We’d really only be able to upgrade that item if we could get an upgrade to drop. Act 1 item drops with 600 dps would actually mean something. You’d find a 600 DPS with 30 int, and instantly equip it. A week later, you could find a 600 DPS with 80 int, and you’d be pleased as punch, and equip that. Eventually, you may eek out enough gear to beat the Butcher and his enrage timer. Then you would start farming Act 2… **and those drops would mean something.** Each time you get one of those drops, and you love it. You love playing Diablo

With the auction house in Diablo III, undercutting eachother, until an ilvl 63 very very good roll item is only worth 20-50k gold… which you can earn in about 6 minutes farming jars in royal crypts. 

So now, and your reward? You can now go farm siegebreaker in act 3 so that maybe…. Just maybe… you can sell an item for 50k gold yourself. Wow… where’d the fun go?


**Where the fun is**

The fun is in hardcore. Sure, you’ll randomly die from aspects out of your control, such as lag. I did last night. It felt like a waste of my time.

The trick is changing that mindset. 

Here’s what happens in hardcore..

People die. People lose gear. They need to buy more gear. This means that the hardcore auction house is constantly being cleaned out of higher tier gear

**There are other markets.**

There are markets for level reduction gear. This is a MASSIVE stat in hardcore

There is a market for + experience gear in hardcore. People are constantly remaking their characters, it leaves the economy, ensuring people can’t just buy 1 set and be good for the next 10 years.

There is a market for gems. Good lord is there a market for gems – and socketed items. A level 13-40 weapon with a  socket might as well be a lotto ticket

There is a market for vitality!! So many classes in normal-mode couldn’t give 2 craps for vitality. Hardcore is obviously different. Vitality is a huge stat, thus more stuff you find along the way will actually have buyers at the other end. 

**Conclusion**

If you want to play in an atmosphere where the entire market is saturated with top level gear… where you farm for weeks and maybe get a 1300 dps weapon, just so you can purchase an upgrade at diluted cost, negating any “eureka” moment that your brain desires… then go play normal mode.

If you want an atmosphere where the auction house is constantly being drained of items

You may die. You may lose everything you had. But you will learn. And you will get better. And you’ll have a LOT more fun doing it than you are currently having breaking open jars for coins.

Play hardcore. And don’t look back.

**The typical comment I expect

**Comment:** 

I don't have fun losing my best gear and tons of time played due to an unfortunate lag spike, or ridiculous enemy combo. For some people, this is an additional thrill, but for me, it would be depressing.

**My response**

Exactly. I was of this mindset too. I mean... right up until I decided to write this article. 

Just last night

Then I thought....

What else am I going to do? Am I seriously going to do siegebreaker runs

Instead

Dying in hardcore means I get an opportunity to learn from my mistake and get better. I get to twink out my character (I personally find that fun) for a few levels, but those upgrades are, you know, actually upgrades!

I will gain satisfaction

I won't be able to cheese content by making a 70k dps witch doctor that just zergs stuff dead but dies itself

It's just a mental mindset that needs to change, and hardcore is the complete and utter solution.

To review what everyone knows already: IAS was massively overbudget.  With 1400 (e.g.) Int, it not only improves DPS, but increased all proc rates and LOH effects, and helps mobility.  The only downside is that some builds (Blizzard) don't benefit from it.  But in a build optimized for it, the scaling was out of control.  Anyway, this is what you know already.

The most common rallying cry is that some sort of diminishing returns mechanism would have been better.  My main point is there is that this is nothing but an attempt at bargaining--there's no design justification for it.  DR setups are properly used where things scale in a nonlinear way.  %-based mitigation/avoidance is a standard example from both WoW and Diablo.  If you let them scale naturally

But IAS scaling was perfectly linear already.  The problem was not that once you had too much

1339101353.0,uqdco,Beginner's Guide to Grinding the Auction House (AH): How I Make &gt;500k Per Hour.,REInvestor,460,192,403,"Hi there. I'm REInvestor and I'd like to teach you the basics of how to profitably farm the AH. I don't use macros, but in it

---

There are many strategies for profitably arbitraging the AH

I started with 250k on the night of 5/28 and I now have 13m + 5m in auctions/inventory plus I've geared up a bit ([screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Ijj5S.jpg)). I have not kept detailed track of the hours because you don't really need be going all the time. I'm not sure how many hours I've spent doing this

###How Much Time Does This Take?###

Unlike farming in-game

* 5-10 minutes picking up inventory
* 5-10 minutes pricing/listing the inventory
* 5-10 minutes over the course of the next two hours alt-tabbing back into D3 to check the auctions and list new items

Over those two hours (75% of which I spent redditing)

Now, whereas a newbie will need to research heavily at the beginning so they don't overprice. Nonetheless, I think this is the most profitable way to spend time in-game (not the most fun for everyone, obviously), and is something that even people with low level characters can do.

###Focus on Bargain Armor###

I have dabbled into more specialized markets

We've all seen those 1d12h listings on the first page of search that are just insane, don't want to spend the time researching a price, and just throw it up for anywhere from 5-40k.

My sole effort is to locate those items then flip them quickly. Pretty simple right?

**Here's What We're Buying: Just-listed L60 armor priced under 40k with at least 2 useful affixes in decent quantities stats and high armor ratings.**

**Useful Affixes:** STR, VIT, ALL-RES, MF, GF, &amp; IAS. [Definitely read this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/uiyoy/list_of_item_properties_that_are_very_valuable_to/) for more. It doesn't count if the item has say str + dex, but nothing else. You basically want one offensive affix + 1 defensive/bonus affix to make an item desirable.

You generally don't want to buy an item with just one stat and a specific resistance (physical or fire resistance, STR + IAS, INT + ALL-RES, and so on. These are the items that people will actually be looking for and will sell for much higher prices.

Do not buy an item if it says 1d10h or less. You only want 1d12h or 1d11h. The good deals will go quick

Also

###Minimum Armor###

These are the rough minimum armor levels that I need to see on an item before I'll buy it. Anything less

* **Boots:** 500

* **Bracers:** 400

* **Chest:** 675

* **Gloves:** 500

* **Helm:** 675

* **Pants:** 675

* **Shoulders:** 525

###How to Sell the Items###

Your goal is to sell the item very quickly, 200k &amp; so on). If everything else is listed for 200k, but they haven't sold in two hours, those prices are too high.

Search for similar items to yours. If you've got some boots with 75 int, price a little higher, or a little lower if in the opposite situation.

You're gonna have to spend some time going through a few pages of auctions to get a feel for a proper price. Just remember that if you price too high

When you list the item, you could still sell it at the end of the auction and not have to use a new auction slot to list it.

###Items I Avoid###

* **Belts.** I honestly haven't explored the market to know enough about why this happening

* **Rings &amp; Amulets.** There are absolutely ways to make money with these

* **Class-Specific Items.** Wizard hats, if you specialize, you can probably make money. Be careful when searching chest armor and helms as if you're searching for a DH &amp; WZ respectively, their class items will dilute your results and cause you to make a bad buy. 

* **Weapons (Sort-of).** The market for weapons is much more efficient in my experience. DPS is (to a certain extent) the end-all

* **Offhand Items.** Immediate comparison of items is basically impossible with mousing over each item to learn its stats. Until Blizz makes it easy to sort items by other stats than armor/price

###Other Tips###

* **Don't Buy More Than You Sell.** By the end of last week, only buy something if it is a screaming good deal.

* **Don't Get Greedy. This is a Volume Game.** If you think you could probably get 200k, that I've tried to buyout my own listings on occasion. Remember, 90% of the items you see on the AH are priced too high and will basically never sell. 

* **You'll Probably Lose Gold Sometimes.** I've bought things out when I shouldn't have. The worst was what I thought was a screaming deal on a 2h axe for 3m. I hadn't really studied the market and it seemed like a good deal

* **Don't Hesitate.** If you see a rare with a really high armor rating for 10k when the next item has way less armor

###Other Thoughts###

* **Depreciation is Coming.** I foresee even more massive depreciation coming with the inferno nerf and the ability to cancel auctions. First, and the supply at lower price points will increase dramatically, further lowering prices.

* **There Are Probably More Profitable Strategies.** The strategy I use requires little thinking and little market knowledge. A strategy that requires detailed market knowledge could potentially offer higher returns

* **Grinding the AH for IRL $ is Dumb.** The $ price of gold is already pretty low and will get insanely low once the RMAH opens up. Don't think you're gonna do this as a business.

* **I Do This For Fun.** I don't really enjoy grinding inferno or smashing pots over and over. I get a certain thrill from playing the market. Having said that

* **Useful Threads.** [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/umboa/auction_house_and_farming_how_are_people_already/c4wp4zv) are [some](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/tuubt/auction_house_tips/) more [threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/tw16q/guide_to_the_auction_house/) on the subject which could be helpful.

Did the armed, guards in New Tristram not make you feel safe enough? Did the ancient creepy cathedral that once housed the Lord of Motherfucking Terror himself look safe and secure from the demon hordes? 


Don't get me started on Dead Adventurers too. A neighbouring village is burning, to decide that the rational thing to do is EXPLORE THE FUCKING METEOR CRASH SITE?

**Insatiable Void**

Once your jeweler learns the cut

""Insatiable Gems"" drop randomly in the world. As you feed materials into the gem, yellow gems will grow it in intellect. Placing gold into the insatiable gem will increase it's gold find, grey items will increase armor. White items will increase it's pickup radius. Blue and yellow items will increase its magic find, and feeding in legendary items has unknown effects. Unfortunately, it is not possible to tell how much an insatiable gem has grown in power before it is attached to an item.

You can continue to feed items into an unsocketed Insatiable Gem indefinitely. At any time you may seek out your jeweler and have him attach an insatiable gem onto an item, attaching the gem to an item prevents you from selling or trading that item to another player. The gem can never be removed. 


**Chaos Orbs**

We all get into ruts sometimes

Chaos Orbs drop randomly from mobs, and Class-specific. You can only equip 1 of each type at a time, and in addition to your equipped orbs you may only carry 1 of each type. (Example: You have 2 orbs equipped and 2 in inventory, no new orbs will drop for you.) Class-specific orbs will only drop for the class you are currently playing. 

**Some examples of Chaos Orbs:**

**Universal:**

* 10% chance to cast a duplicate spell that uses a random rune variant
* Your crit chance is increased by 10% of your critical hit damage
* Killing an enemy increases your run speed by 1% for 5 seconds (Can exceed cap) but damage you take is increased by your run speed.
* Access to abilities from other classes
* Magic find reduced to 0
* All attacks do AoE damage equal to double your pickup radius.
* Gain 50% of thorns damage as healing


**Wizard:**

* Meteor strikes land instantly
* Each cast of Magic Missile also casts Arcane Torrent: Death Blossom
* Ray of Frost now penetrates all targets

**Barbarian:**

* Frenzy now hits all targets within 10 yards
* Weapon throw no longer costs fury
* Call of the Ancients: Summoned Ancients now last until killed (they inherit your baseline armor

**Monk:**

* Attack speed of Crippling Wave increased by 100%
* While Sweeping Wind is active
* Lashing Tail Kick: Hand of Ytar &amp; Spinning Flame Kick no longer have a spirit cost

**Demon Hunter:**

* Your Rapid Fire can now be channelled while moving
* Entangling Shot has a 10% chance to activate Fan of Knives: Crippling Razors at the impact site
* Bola shot now detonates instantly upon impact
* All hatred generating attacks have damage increased by 250%

**Witch Doctor:**

* Toads generated by Plague of Toads persist for 10 seconds
* Travel speed and damage of Spirit Barrage increased by 100%
* While Angry Chicken is active

When a chaos orb expires, armor, and resistances by 10%. Lasts until you equip a new chaos orb.

In order to equip a Chaos Orb, Azmodan, and Diablo. These are a 100% drop chance at MP1 and above. This will inscribe you with a band of chaos, adding two new inventory slots where you can place Chaos Orbs. 

Edit:

* Each time you die while a Chaos Orb is equipped
* Chance for Chaos Orbs to drop fluctuates based on what you have out of 4, +50% chance. If you have none equipped or in inventory, +100% chance.
* As you feed your insatiable gem, blue, yellow...legendary? in color.

Hope this helps guys&lt;3
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The build: http://us.battle.net/d3/en/calculator/wizard#alRXQO!dbY!cbbaYY  
  
**Pros**: Makes most packs feel easy
  
**Cons**: Lack of those OMGWTF-DPS numbers from no force weapon/familiar. 

  
When I had dinged 60 originally -- I was so lost about wizards.. what weapons were better
what spells were efficient
started a demon hunter.  I began farming inferno ponies/some of A3 -- and as I started a4 on my DH -- I was one shot by every damn thing in the game
  
This build is a twist on the existing  Venom Hydra/Blizzard core that many wizards are already utilizing in inferno; I have experimented with other builds
  
I honestly have almost no issue with ANY sort of affixes in A3/A4 and if I do die
typically just me playing a bit greedy
(this doesn't include soul lashers.. f those guys.)  
  
I have tried all sorts of various builds
Force/Illusionist build
doing; it unfortunately didn't click well.. but it inspired me to tweak a few things around!  
  
You can find VODS of me using the build at http://www.twitch.tv/drizoid (I mention below as well, I HAVE 59K UNBUFFED DPS -- but have done this at 35K without an issue).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
**SKILLS:**  
  
* Hydra (Venom Hydra): As most wizard builds, or whatever it actually does.  It slings projectiles at your foes, while throwing down acid pools which also continue to tick on mobs.  Utilizing blizzard to bundle minions together with a hydra will take care of all of your AOE needs.. regardless of what your gear looks like.  
  
* Blizzard (Snowbound): I tried to get rid of this skill.. I tried to find alternatives... I attempted to utilize temporal flux+arcane hydra+arcane orb in hopes to squeeze in Wave of Force but the lack of venom hydra, but its super efficient, and allows you to bundle most packs together to allow Venom hydra/pools to do their work!  I've had people ask about the increased blizzard radius, and the chance on freeze (20%) -- they both really didn't work out for me.  I felt like, for increased radius, it would have to be 2x as much, and even then, I've heard people say you need to max movement speed.. I run around with 11% --  from boots
  
* Magic Missle (Seeker): This is amazing.  Sure, throwing stuff out there without worrying much about where it goes because it'll typically connect (even connects sometimes if I throw it forward and they're behind me) -- it's really really amazing in inferno.  Let me repeat, I use a 2hander (with only IAS coming from jewelry+gloves) -- and it's still super efficient.  Hits for 40k-100k, makes boss fights/champion packs a joke while blizzard and hydra round them up.  People have asked why not Piercing Orb -- because the oscilation is weird, and it has a god awful casting animation.  It does great damage, and it's really nifty in IAS 1h builds -- but it was painful to try on a 2h and honestly, I don't need more AOE -- Blizzard/Hydra fit the bill, and MM-Seeker fits that need.  
  
* Teleport (Fracture): This skill is part of the reason why I can farm/quest so easily in inferno.  Using illusionist as a passive allows me to constantly kite with force armor, it gets you over walls, jump from high/low terrain, and even over molten/desecration/poison pools.  Often, the mirror images will eat attacks, giving you even more time to aoe/position/seeker missle.  This spell along with others made inferno less frustrating and much more enjoyable.  
  
* Diamond Skin (Crystal Shell): Because sometimes teleport with fracture isn't enough and makes reflect damage easy to deal with.  I've had people tell me diamond skin is worthless in inferno, and generally gives me an 'oh shit' button when I see those damn spear chuckers/oppressor charges, etc.  Utilizing this in order to trigger illusionist, or force vortexes is it's main strength, but generally it's fantastic all around to give you a huge buffer with force-armor (usually an additional 2-3 hits).  
  
* Energy Armor (Force Armor): This is what makes a wizard a farming/inferno clearning machine.  You need to get your resists/health to make force armor effective and avoid being one shot by most things.  Certain things may still one-shot you, molten, desecration, or fire-chains as those tick down and do not deal large chunks of damage (that's what teleport/fracture is for).  Additionally, this allows the reset of teleport (through illusionist) over and over and over, and with diamondskin, gives you a huge health buffer every 15 seconds!  
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 
**PASSSIVES:**  

* Illusionist: This is what makes the build so viable in inferno.. because you shouldn't die in one hit to most things, box walls, move from high/low terrain+blink for health globes and generally just play effectively.  Unless I'm going against a waller/jailer I will use my teleport typically whenever it's up to create distance as I know I'll be safe if I get hit to use it again.  
  
* Evocation: This puts teleport/diamond skin on a shorter CD.  Could you do without it?  Maybe.. but there have been so many clutch moments I've waited on my CD to come back up for either of those skills and that hair of a second has made the difference.  I wouldn't use anything else.  
  
* Glass Cannon: This skill is somewhat optional -- I feel like since you're losing some damage from buffs, and have success, let me know! (I always love suggestions!)  
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
**FOLLOWER:**  
  
This is obviously up to your play-style, and really recommend enchantress..  Sure, she can be a bitch sometimes -- when she polymorphs you instead of the enemy, but her reflect shield+force wave+polymorf CC has really helped deal with A3/A4 (I love watching spears bounce off me because of her shield!).  Her force-push back pushes them back in venomhydra/blizzard, and that's always helpful.

What I find disturbing while playing it over again and again, but you will never defeat Y!"" and then the cut-scenes.
The cinematics is always Blizzardingly mindblowing - but the ingame cut-scenes

Watching the 2008 gameplay trailer, we get a subtle feel of an ominous threat awaiting, when the barbarian arrives at the tomb. A distant scream from an unknown terror, forces the bridge in front of the barbarian to crumble. Later in the hallway we see a dark shadow of a giant beast in the background, and the guards express their fear of what is to come. (The events leading up to Skeleton King in Act 1 in the final game, have some of this, and is perhaps why I love Act 1 so much compared to the other Acts).
The 2008 video's grand finale is the giant Seagebreaker crusing through the wall without any warning
There is no pause and fading to black, where the boss takes you by surprise.
This was what happened in Diablo 2, waiting to kill you.

In Diablo 3
By the way - how many people had not hoped that the Bosses would have more advanced phases and mechanics in the later difficulties? Again in the 2008 video, when the hoardes of skeletons are summoned as a last stand...

Why do these awesome, we could easily say “make them give good loot!” and BAM, but it did not increase their value above status quo. Status Quo being: Elite and Champion Pack like drops. We can do much better than simply making Purples drop better loot.

Because Purples are more rare than elites, some are not, the loot table should reflect the rareness of the mob. Great segue! Loot Table, Purples should have specific loot tables, similar to bosses in D2. For example, Bussaw(sp) in A3 Rakkis Crossing could have an increased chance to drop a Maximus. Now you’re asking, “but people will just farm these specific purples!”, if Blizzard balances the drops correctly

Now that drops have been improved


How can we make Purples more challenging? Well obviously increase their health and damage. Additionally

	I wanted to post a picture of my gear and long story short I ended up writing a little script 
	to make the process much faster and easier.

Big thanks to  [sed- ](http://www.ownedcore.com/forums/diablo-3/diablo-3-bots-programs/360293-item-screenshot-montage-generator.html) whose code I used as a basis for this.    
    



		How to Use
	* Download the executable or the script 
		(You need python and Python Image Library (PIL) to run the code)

	* Go in the game and take screenshots (hit *Print Screen*) of your gear
	* You MUST:
	*    Be wearing the gear when you take the screenshot
	*   Take the screenshots in a specific order which is:
	*      Shoulders,Weapon ~ Helmet, Chest,Belt,Pants,Boots ~ Amulet, Bracers,Off Hand
	*      Basically
	*      The need for this is because the script crops pictures at a specific percentage of the image width (pattern recognition proved to be too much for a Saturday project)


		
	These screeshots are saved in Documents\Diablo3\Screenshots.
		
	We need to put them in a folder with the executable
	the Screenshots folder and drag the new screenshots in there.   
	Be careful
		

	Now we have 13 screenshots and the executable/script in the same folder (with no other images inside it)
	all that's left is to run the executable (double click the .exe) or run the script.  

		

	Give it a couple seconds and you'll see the Item Wall image in that same folder.  

		
	It should work for most aspect ratios
		 
	If you guys want I can upgrade it to expect a screenshot of the ""Details"" page.  
		 
	You can get the script here:  
	https://sourceforge.net/projects/diablo3itemwall/files/

This game is amazing, but I think for this game to have real longevity there has to be some major tweaking and changes being made. Here are some of the big flaws I believe this game has that can hurt it in the long run:

* Itemization. It's being [talked about](http://diablo.incgamers.com/blog/comments/end-game-items-broken-legendaries-much-weaker-than-common-magic-items) a lot right now, but as it is right now there is no excitement to be had or thrill for seeking out a Legendary or Set piece. I don't necessarily think they should be the end-all to items in the game, but I do believe they should always be an upgrade to a blue, and in most cases even to rares. I like the idea of rares having a chance at being better than Legendaries, you just have to get really lucky... But, it doesn't seem like you have to be all that lucky to get a magic item or rare that will out perform the rarest items in the game. Not a good system.

* More Affixes on items, but I want the chance to have all the useful Affixes I'm looking for an item, as well as the item having Gold radius pick-up. Sometimes you will get trash rares, I'm OK with that. I'm also OK with getting class specific rares that have stats totally unrelated to your class. I like the randomness. I just think removing the limit of Affixes gives your items more value, because even if you get that class rare Demon Hunter quiver you could very well get every single affix you want on it as well as some unrelated affix like a bonus to a Witch Doctor ability. It won't matter, because you have everything else you needed. But, since we have a cap, and people just want to have items with a huge list of Affixes because it's just cool to have

* Give Act bosses additional mechanics/random mechanics in the later difficulties. Anyone in Nightmare, he just takes longer to kill. We have incentive to kill bosses thanks to the Nephelam Valor buff at level 60 (Diablo in Hell dropped me 3 rares and 6 magic items at 5 stacks of Valor) but there is no challenge in it. My party of 4 didn't even come close to wiping on Diablo in hell mode, but we certainly wiped numerous times against random packs of elites. Act bosses, both minor ones and major ones, need extra mechanics. Preferably random ones. This is a game all about randomness, right? Why not at times have the Skeleton King spawning with Frozen and making the ice balls explode around while fighting him? Or other times have the Skeleton King vortex you to make his hammer swing ability harder to avoid? Even better would be if bosses got their own unique random mechanics. Let Diablo rain Meteors from the sky at times or at other times spawn little fire demons who run at you and explode for big damage. If they do not make changes to the boss fights people will do exactly what Blizzard didn't want and just start farming them. With a full stack of valor you will easily get 2 - 4 rares, and eventually everybody will be very comfortable with the bosses mechanics and they will be farmable.

* Make the Auction House better. This is a pretty vague statement, because I can't remember everything they had. I sold a wand for 400k, and I can remember the basics of the stats it had but I'd like to know for sure, so I can remember how to structure prices in the future. It seems like a very simple thing to allow users to do, so I'm not sure why you can't do it.

That's enough ranting. If you took the time to read I appreciate it. I'm going to go back and play some more D3. If there are people who feel differently about this I'd love to hear your feedback.

1337463671.0,tv6pr,A PSA About Loot and You: Why You're Not Seeing the Drops You Want,Thesreyn,340,83,218,"Skip to the tl;dr at the bottom if you want

So there's been a lot of comments and threads about the state of loot drops in Diablo 3. The common complaints are that class specific loot isn't dropping, or are lacking in stats... The list goes on, but the underlying theme is that people aren't finding the loot they want.

Let us get one thing out in the open very early on:

**The drops you are getting are intentional and effective

I'll take a step back now and explain this. In many other games

Now in games like these where there is a low population

A given player has a maximum amount of time that they can play. Take the upper bound of that maximum amount of time and you have what is essentially an upper bound on the amount of times a person has access to loot

The amount of Loot Instances a player in Diablo 2 has access to is actually fairly limited, players saw a lot more useful and powerful drops in their Loot Instances because they had a lower overall cap on the amount of Loot Instances they had access to.

In Diablo 3, then twisted into a Gordian Knot.

Diablo 3 gives every single player access to a mind-boggling increase in the number of Loot Instances they have access to (though this access is somewhat restricted). The most obvious comparison is looking at Diablo 2 Co-op versus Diablo 3 Co-op: In D2, whereas in D3 players have access to their individual Loot Instance and restricted access to as many as 1-3 more Loot Instances.

These changes alone vastly increase the number of Loot Instances a given player has access to. Thus the game must take into account a very basic economic principle: Saturation.

Consider if the drop rates of Diablo 2 were maintained while the number of Loot Instances increased linearly. Items would lose an enormous amount of value

In order to prevent this from happening and to maintain the desirability of rare items, but in some cases this won't work, and this case is where the Developers of D3 have stated the best loot is to be found:

Rares.

Those wonderful yellow items that we see a ridiculously large amount of. But they don't excite us like they used to. Back in Diablo 2, have not changed. So if we apply what we've discussed so far to rare items in Diablo 3, we see an increase in Loot Instances without a decrease in drop rates, a sure-fire way to cause saturation of rare items. If the power of rare items was maintained, you would have saturation of powerful, desirable items and the overall value of these items would go down, effectively tanking the economy.

So how does the game fix that? It's quite simple really. It uses our old friend the Random Number Generator (RNG). When a rare item is created

Unfortunately

When a pair of pants (for example) is rolled, Diablo 3 accommodates for the vastly increased number of Loot Instances a player has access to, by making it vastly less likely for a player to see a ""perfectly"" rolled item, something that is absolutely beautiful for a single class, like a +Int, +Vit, +Crit

*BUT THESREYN*

Well my friend

The Auction House.

The Auction House gives every player restricted access to billions of Loot Instances across millions of players. For a nominal fee

We can liken this to the fundamentals of a town. A Baker produces plenty of baked goods, like stoves, so he trades his baked goods to acquire currency to purchase stoves from the Small Appliances Man. And occassionally the Baker might like to splurge and get himself a yellow stove with +Heat and -Chance to Burn.

Where have we seen this sort of thing before? In a lot of MMO's. World of Warcraft is a nice example. Plenty of Loot Instances that players have restricted access to, we're making an enormous transition from not only the way loot is handled in Diablo 2, but the way the **entire genre** handles loot.

**So what does this mean for us as players?**

The most important thing is for players to realise the differences. Diablo 3's loot system was made with the increase in access to Loot Instances (restricted or no) and the Auction House in mind. Players are expected to make use of the Auction House. It is entirely possible for a player to try and acquire all their loot from their own drops

We, to excitement about finding a powerful item that could be valuable to someone else.

This means that the old-school style of having a bit of a sigh when you picked up that perfect Baker's Stove on your Lumberjack is gone. That item's value to you is **increased** from what it has held in previous instances of the genre

The system is by no means perfect. It felt GOOD to pick up an awesome item for your character, rather than pulling it from the dead carcass of Lightning-Enchanted Fire Immune Dune Bugs. And the Auction House interface itself needs to be made MUCH more powerful, intuitive and fluid. A tutorial on how it works is a must and I can't believe this was an oversight.

Overall though, and perhaps some compromise with Blizzard about drop rates and the way certain items are rolled, but the game has only just come out, so we must give both Blizzard time to monitor the economy, and ourselves time to adjust.

It does kind of screw those who don't like the Auction House though...

**tl;dr: Increased access to loot via more drops and the Auction House necessitates lowered drop rates and randomised items that could be anywhere on a scale of terrible to godlike,False,self,t5_2qore,1337481356.0,,wizard-americas,t3_tv6pr

7. If you are a demon hunter and find yourself at 0 health from the Smokescreen bug
8. Pushing escape ends an entire dialogue tree, then come back it'll finish instantly. Thanks The_Auryn!
9. If you are wondering what the stats of an item you sold in the AH were
10. In Act 3, the meters still climb even through the guys are getting killed, and you still get the exp! Note at higher difficulties (ie. hell) the meters stall more and can stop completely.

15. Maximum movespeed is 25% from items alone. Even if you get more items that go above that you'll cap at 25%. **Passive** movespeed bonuses also cap at 25% like the Monk's fleet footed. You'll need legendaries to get above 12%
16. (Bonus I remembered!). If you are salvaging a bunch of items you don't have to click each item and drag it to the blacksmith. Just click the anvil/salvage button and your cursor will change to a hammer

**I am first and foremost a gamer. I do NOT plan on botting D3 anytime soon. I'm going to thoroughly enjoy this game i've waited years for. I love video games

I am far from the biggest person out there, as there is a high level of risk (which grows every day); not for the faint of heart. I can share some horror stories and huge losses if you guys are interested.

All I ask is that you keep an open mind about this and don't instantly down vote in to oblivion. Ask anything you want - methods, hardware setups, how to get in to it, risks, BOTTING in general, ways companies detect botters, etc. 

**Background**
I actually started my virtual item selling in D2 days with D2jsp about 10 years go. Botting was ""relatively"" newer and not as widespread then, i ended up with a few d2 accounts that would farm items nearly 24/7. I had every kind of epic, rare, set item imaginable....times 20. I think i was up to 10 or so mule accounts. One day while bored of D2, I thought back to how a buddy of mine got a Wurmslayer (Everquest) as a birthday gift from his parents. The sword I think ended up costing them $250 bucks due to it's rarity at the time. I figured what the hell, and posted some of the rarer D2 items I had and went to bed. The next day I woke up and noticed every auction I put up already was bought out. That's where my journey began.

I soon moved on to hardcore as the items sold for 75-100% more, then transferring the items to buyers in the afternoon, over and over. The entire process was maybe a hour or so worth of work a day; which I was easily had time for as a student. Items sold anywhere from 3 bucks to upwards of 30 or so; which equated to probably 20-50 per day -- which wasn't to bad for me since it was barely any work at all. Once D2jsp no longer was safe to use (IE: detectable), I started using mmbot, which farmed Pindleskin non stop. I started ramping up my production, and had 14 bnet keys i rotated through to avoid the ""too many games in a hour"" detection, which of course was automated. 

Fast forward to WoW. Up until about 5 months ago, you could easily make a few k a month with 1 computer and little effort -- especially having a bot that could harvest nodes, send them to an alt, log on that alt, and post them on the ah. It was 100% automated. 

Selling virtual items has come a long way, and the methods in which to avoid getting your accounts banned (detected or otherwise) have also evolved greatly. Things like avoiding ""Warden"" (blizzards built in anti-cheat software) are only part of the risk now, and losing at least some accounts is just part of the cost of doing business. Ironically enough, i keep reading posts saying there will be no botting in D3 because Blizzard has learned from the past. To an extent, they have, but for every measure blizzard takes to ensure a bot free environment, there are three new countermeasures to get around it. It's a never ending battle; botting will exist for as long as their are video games out

Obviously, i just picked ones that were relevant to most. I think many under-estimate what bots can do today. I'd say the average wow player encounters at least 3-5 bots per week in some fashion and have no idea that it is in fact a bot. I've been a member of underground botting/farming operations and have used countless bots for every game imaginable. Furthermore, I have a good insight and details about how some of the really big farming companies and websites (those making 100k + a month). I truly believe that what the majority of the gaming population knows about botting is only really a tip of the iceberg.

So there you have it, check out that link above, i've already answered a few questions some had about this subject. Anything other questions you have about this somewhat secretive world, or bots, or i guess anything related, by all means, ask.

**edit**

I want to add my take on botting in D3. First and foremost, but not anywhere near the D2 rate.

In terms of actual bots, fear not, Blizzard knows this and has other methods of detecting botters in a multitude of ways outside of player reports. Besides their anti-cheat software ""Warden"", I believe they have forms of pattern detection. Obviously, I can't say for certain since they would never disclose information like this, but from my personal experience recent with WoW botting it seems to hold true. Most likely, they have ""triggers"" that will flag a particular account if a certain criteria is met - such as playing for 24 hours straight constantly farming the same areas. In short

A little background on my personal experience with Diablo 3 before we get started.

I have 400 hours played.
I have cleared Inferno.
I can farm all of the acts
I have killed 12
I love this game and I'm looking forward to future expansions and patches.

This is a general collection of opinions that I think would enhance the game. These opinions are intended to add variety and alleviate the frustration of unavoidable deaths and the general unfairness of some rares/champions.

**Desecrator**

* Limit to 2 or 3 active desecrators per monster.
* Add elemental variety (cold, electricity)

**Electrified**

* Increase the damage
* Increase the range
* Decrease the abundance
* Add elemental variety (fire, cold)

**Fast**

* Remove from inherently fast and/or kiting monsters.

**Fire Chains**

* Add elemental variety (cold, electricity)

**Frozen** 

* Prevent consecutive freezing. Frozen targets should be immune to frozen to prevent unavoidable freeze deaths.
* Add elemental variety (Fire, electricity)

**EDIT:** for clarification.

&gt;**For example and entertainment purposes only:**

&gt;Fire bombs: Looks like Frozen but is red

&gt;Poison poppers: Looks like Frozen but is green

&gt;Ball Lightning: Looks like Frozen but is blue, fury, arcane and discipline.

**Invulnerable Minions** 

* Remove from inherently shielding

**Molten** 

* Lower the damage (completely insane right now
* Add elemental variety (cold, electricity)

**Mortar** 

* Add elemental variety (cold, electricity)

**Nightmarish**

* Prevent chain fearing
* allow 1 second of immunity between fears
* add diminishing returns or a cooldown

**Plagued** 

* Increase damage
* Add elemental variety (fire, cold)

**Shielding** 

* Remove the CC immunity from shielding
* Remove from inherently shielding

**Reflect Damage** 

* Should not be constant (~25% downtime)
* Should be a visible indicator of some kind. 

**Arcane sentries**

* Add elemental variety (fire, cold)
* Prevent the combination of Horde + Arcane
* Different elemental sentries could do different damage

In conclusion; i think some of the affixes are semi broken and could use some fixes. Some affixes need buffs, they are simply cheesy and need some work to make them both challenging and exciting.

In August they nerfed the hell out of elites making the question not if you can kill them

[Paragon Levels](http://www.diablowiki.net/Paragon) came out: after reaching level 60, +3 to primary stat, +2 to vitality and +1 to secondary stats. The magic find cap on gear/paragon levels is 300% (not including monster power or nephalem valor stacks). This makes magic find less and less important to have on your gear as you gain paragon levels.

[Monster power](http://www.diablowiki.net/Monster_Power) is the difficulty of monsters (more health and damage) in exchange for XP, and more items/demonic essences dropping. [Here](http://www.diablowiki.net/images/4/41/Monster-power-bonuses2.jpg) is a chart displaying what this is all about. All acts MP1+ are the same difficulty now and have the same chance to drop i63 items.

[Demonic Essence](http://www.diablowiki.net/Demonic_Essence) is a BoA item used to craft i63 BoA equipment. They drop off of elites and treasure goblins.

Two new shrines were added to the game:

* Empowered Shrine – Increases resource regeneration and reduces cooldowns
* Fleeting Shrine – Increases movement speed and pickup radius

PvP was released in February. You can only fight players in the Scorched Chapel; speak with Nek the Brawler to enter.

I hope more people decide to come back. If anybody has anything to add

What happened to gamers who actually like immersion? Why aren't we going in that direction AT ALL?

The game could definitely do with more dungeons and events rather than just more mindless elites. I mean events with serious rewards... not throwing 1000 gold at you...

New events can spawn in acts in inferno only.

Here are just a few examples:

* Khazra Tower: a 5 leveled dungeons with purple bosses(increasing in difficulty) on each level



* Skeleton Pit: a 2 level dungeon that is packed with hordes and hordes of skeletons. Massive amount of skeletons between you and level 2. After managing to fight your way to the bottom is a purple uber cultist renamed to a necromancer. Upon killing him



* Arcane Portal: Single level dungeon. Takes you to a confusing dungeon with various levers and doors. There is a total of 7 locked rooms, being occupied by a purple Subjugator.



* Burning Pit: Similar styles of the hall of agony, and fire obelisks that summon burning spiders. This place will be a test of fire resistance for sure. Close to the end, an event is triggered where the entire place is going to be swallowed by lava, and you must run to the treasure room and escape. If you fail, then you die and the dungeon is sealed.



These are just a few examples. Of course it would take much longer to implement these new types of things,False,self,t5_2qore,False,idea,demonhunt-americas,t3_17933i

1358622991.0,16vzp1,The biggest difference between the WoW team and the D3 team,Helarhervir,346,97,216,"The biggest difference between the Wow and Diablo teams at Blizzard:

Communication.
It's the key for people to understand the developers. It allows us to follow their thought process and understand their iterations in their design. It lets us see that they are trying, and progression (though, I think maybe the silence might be telling enough.)


The dichotomy between how well the WoW team communicates and how badly the Diablo team communicates is grand. Both teams have projects on the ptr. What does the WoW team post on the forums?


[WoW Blue Posts](http://imgur.com/a/BRLos#5)


This is just since the 16th. That's 3 days worth of stuff addressing concerns, abilities, fun,  and most importantly, addressing the community. This quantity (and quality) of dialogue has been maintained since the PTR dropped. 


Ghostcrawler


Also within the last few days we've gotten a Dev watercooler/Coffee with the Devs (if you are of the European persuasion)


Now I will give you what the Diablo 3 team has posted in the last three days:

-A post about how the main developer is stepping down

-The main guy's boss telling us to stop picking on him (and the cross-post of this on reddit... from a Blue)

-Nothing about classes or design (minus the post about CC and dmg to Elites) since the 12th when the 1.0.7 blog full of changes was posted.

-Known Issues with PTR and Friend Invitations.


So overall, why would he continue to do it if it didn't work?) to not just the community, but the Devs too and yet they are barren.


I think at this point the D3 team is afraid of the community because of how vehemently passionate we are. We all wanted this to be an amazing game, had no end-game, etc. (I could go on and on about the things that were/are wrong, but I think at this point it's just preaching to the choir). 


We expected these great things because Blizzard was open with their intents and clearly misjudged the amount of resources and effort to allocate correctly. Because of this a lot of things were scrapped, etc., and the community reacted very negatively and very loudly. 


Each time something they've planned hasn't come to fruition, I can understand why they would be wary about sharing things that they are planning on doing in the future with a community that will lambast, excoriate, and demonize them.


But I do believe people truly want to love this game, but because there is no one left that cares enough to complain. 


**TLDR**; D3 Team needs to take a leaf out of the WoW Team's book and open up/broaden the lines of communication between those who make and those who play the game.


PS. If I have to type community or communication one more time I will stab my eyes out.

I think I speak for a lot of people when I say that Monster Power is a huge step in the right direction.  However

Many comments in other posts have recommended having MP increase the level of the enemies slain in lower acts.  Obviously the details would need to be worked out by the blizzard wizards(Say, but I think there is a large consensus forming that we are a bit disheartened that it looks like we are still going to need to continue to farm act 3 to maintain maximum efficiency.

I would like to reiterate that there are really no new ideas in this post that haven't been said in various posts/comments already.  The purpose of this post is to create one central location for supporters of this idea to discuss this change out of hopes that it gets noticed by the right people at blizzard and can be worked into 1.05

Thank you for your time everyone

For more information on the current specifics of how the monster power system works check out [this interview with Jay Wilson and Wyatt Cheng](http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/09/22/diablo-3-patch-1-05-interview-with-jay-wilson-and-wyatt-cheng/).

**IMPORTANT EDIT: The interview seems to have been stealth changed at some point.  There seems to have been a change in the monster power mechanics.**

&gt; How will it affect the distribution of items? Like

&gt; WC: You can get item level 63 stuff in all acts of Inferno when Monster Power is on. The moment you go into Inferno with any kind of Monster Power, cranking up Monster Power beyond MP1 does not further increase your chance of getting 63 stuff.

So yeah, but another play-style might consider it ""best in slot.""

Here are some things that aren't ""cookie cutter"" stats but particular classes find them very valuable. Please add your own ideas!

**Follower amulets with magic find** - THESE SELL FOR A LOT. DO NOT SALVAGE UNTIL YOU HAVE COMAPRED TO OTHER SIMILAR ITEMS ON THE AH.

**Witch Doctor items with pickup radius** - Witch doctors use a passive called ""Grave Injustice, do NOT discount the value of pickupradius as a junk stat. Witch doctors covet it.

**Blue rings/ammies with life on hit + magic find/gold find/all resists -** Last night

**ANY item with ~17+ MF:** Everyone wants to have a magic find gear. If you have an item with decent stats and ~17% magic find, the thing will sell for millions. ANY item with 20% MF will sell for a decent amount. Some people simple MF switch and therefore don't even care about the other stats

**Weapons with two of the following: life on hit, but those are basically the stats people look for in weapons. Getting one with main stat and vit is obviously nice, but weapons are unique in HOW MUCH crit damage you can socket into it/roll, and the same goes for life on hit. I sold a 700 something dps one hander (not much damage) with 500 life on hit, a socket, and 70% crit damage for 10 million. In retrospect, I probably got ripped off (it sold quick). Now, but you can see that the ""dps"" stat isn't the end all be all stat for weapons as some people make them out to be.

**Helms with MF AND a socket:** These sell FOR QUITE A BIT. If you can find a helm with ~15% MF AND a socket

**Shields with high block chance -** Should sound obvious, it's the first thing they look at, and without a high block chance, they won't even consider everything else). If you roll a high level shield with +block%, hold on to it:) A sacred shield with ~24-30% block rate can get HUGE amounts if its other stats are even just mediocre:)

1337430916.0,tun1l,The purpose of Act bosses - Why their loot is bad,mattavich,320,73,273,"I noticed some people are a bit disappointed that Act Bosses don't give good loot.

But Blizzard have really polished this game and there is a reason behind a lot of their design.

In D2 there would be a constant boss run grinding

Act bosses in D3 don't drop good loot

The loot that drops in nightmare act 1 is not as good as the loot that drops in nightmare act 4. There are many different Tiers of loot and to get that loot you have to reach certain parts of the game on certain difficulties.

So the point of these bosses is to give you a challenge to earn the right to farm loot from champions/elite monsters in the next act. When you get into Hell mode you will likely find that you need to get new items before you can challenge the act boss and earn the right to the next Act. 

Once you're in the next act you can farm away until you feel strong enough to take on the next boss. Eventually earning the right to fight in ACT 4 Inferno will grant you the possibility of finding the best items in game.


&gt;&gt;&gt;***EDIT***&lt;&lt;&lt;


For those of you who are a bit pissed about this system. Blizzard also created a buff which you get at level 60. Every time you killed a Rare or Champion your Valor buff stacks. This buff increases MagicFind. 

This means that you can still get lots of rare items from bosses. But you need to kill some Champions and Rares first. Effectively forcing you to include other parts of the game in your boss runs.

Blizzard are a canny lot

1. This was [the first ever live version](http://www.flickr.com/photos/97515615@N08/9042462521/in/set-72157634123713387) of D3Up.
2. I'll bet you didn't know that [D3Up originally started as an item sharing site](http://www.flickr.com/photos/97515615@N08/9042462375/in/set-72157634123713387)? A place where you could just create items
3. [Build's were added in the first few weeks](http://www.flickr.com/photos/97515615@N08/9034169869/)
4. With the [first compare tool](http://www.flickr.com/photos/97515615@N08/9042462229/)
5. Because it was so difficult and time consuming to compare
6. The [headers were created](http://www.flickr.com/photos/97515615@N08/9042461993/) on the top of each build to help identify who you were looking at. 
7. For the first 3-4 months of D3Up... you had to create your builds by hand. The API wasn't released and syncing your build wasn't even an option! The [first sync tool](http://www.flickr.com/photos/97515615@N08/9034169459/) was released in September of last year and things have only gotten easier since. 
8. In october of last year

It's crazy going back and looking through all this stuff, and I hope it doesn't disappoint :)

It took me 623hrs 58min to hit 100... I NEVER rolled any other toon besides my WD.


I didn't put much emphasis on efficiency


I REALLY suck at economics, which I bought in a panic thinking it was way underpriced.  I was wrong.  I never used the RMAH.  The only reason I have decent gear is through good-old-fashioned time and luck.


The moment of glory: http://imgur.com/BTVfm3z
As you can see


For every one of you who argues that hitting plvl100 isn't impressive


So what's the plan now?  Seeing as how I've only ever played a WD (who will always be my main squeeze), sharing drops between my characters.  It's not like I have any clue what I'm doing on the AH anyways, and from what I'm hearing from the devs they're headed in a more BOA direction which works great for me.  If I feel like I'm just not progressing I'll allow myself to play my WD to find upgrades for my alts, so I don't know if I'll be allowed to say I'm ""self-found"" considering I've used the AH for my Doc.


Anyways, thanks to patch 1.0.8 for making 90-100 fly by.  You guys are awesome, fuck the haters, send me a friend invite and we can be diabros.

&gt;Hello
&gt;
&gt;I really appreciate the amount of time you put into this
&gt;
&gt;Basically, Plague, and Desecrator. As far as I have found, the normal damage display puts three of these together (As long as the target is actually in the DOT long enough to have three happen, otherwise it displays the total value it reached).
&gt;
&gt;So what you have found is the base value, and all three were one-shotting you. I know when I tested to verify this (Against the Hell Warden, since he's guaranteed molten) my health was only around 4k, which is below the lowest damage number you would expect from a DOT for naked at 90% mitigation. Let me do the math for them:
&gt;
&gt;Molten: Naked: 5986 (Expected: 21000) (*3: 17958) Gear: 2100
&gt;
&gt;Plague Naked: 5702 (Expected: 17000) (*3: 17106) Gear: 1700
&gt;
&gt;Desecrator Naked: 12643 (Expected: 42000) (*3: 37929) Gear: 4200
&gt;
&gt;You'll note that it's about 3 times less damage than the expected result for each of them. Since you only survived 1 pulse of each (When the normal result had 3 added together
&gt;
&gt;So again




Good Evening

After seeing complaints regarding a ""Stealth Buff"" to damage

**Method**
Take 10 hits of damage in full gear and 1 hit of damage naked.  This was repeated for the following effects.  Tested in Breeched Keep level 2.

* Soul Lasher Attack
* Frozen
* Molten
* Plague
* Desecrator
* Arcane Sentry
* Wall of Fire


**Armor and Resistances In Gear**

* Armor: 7105 (69.02% reduction against mLvl63)
* All Resist: 802 (71.85% reduction against mLvl63)
* No reduction against Melee/Ranged Attacks


**Armor and Resistances Naked**

* Armor: 292 (8.48% reduction against mLvl63)
* All Resist: 7 (2.17% reduction against mLvl63)
* No reduction against Melee/Ranged Attacks


**Soul Lasher Attack**

* Naked: 68092
* Gear: 6600
* Reduction: 90%


**Frozen**

* Naked: 62443
* Gear: 6000
* Reduction: 90%


**Molten**

* Naked: 5986
* Gear: 2100
* Reduction: 65%


**Plague**

* Naked: 5702
* Gear: 1700
* Reduction: 70%


**Desecrator**

* Naked: 12643
* Gear: 4200
* Reduction: 67%


**Arcane Sentry**

* Naked: 68035
* Gear: 6600
* Reduction: 90%


**Wall of Fire**

* Naked: 13362
* Gear: 13359
* Reduction: 0%


**Analysis**

* Additional damage reduction from armor alone is 66.4%
* Additional damage reduction from resistances alone is 71.22%
* Additional damage reduction from both armor and resistances is 90.32%

Soul Lasher

Molten, however the expected reduction of only resistances is within the experimental error.

Wall of Fire does not appear to be affected by any sort of damage reduction.

1340748066.0,vnhw3,Clearing up some misconceptions about inflation and deflation on the auction house (a quick economics lesson!),zirconst,349,109,212,"Various commenters and streamers have been discussing inflation in the economy of Diablo 3

**What is inflation?**
Inflation simply means a general rise in the price of goods. When people talk about ""gold inflation"" in Diablo 3

**What is deflation?**
The opposite; a general decrease in the price of goods.

**How are average prices (values) determined?**
While anyone can list any item for any price

The **demand** curve refers to the price points buyers are willing to pay for a given item. There are more people lower on the curve, more on that later.
.
The **supply** curve refers to the price points sellers are willing to sell their goods at. 

The intersection of these two curves is the 'equilibrium price', markets such as the auction house gravitate toward the equilibrium price. This is fairly intuitive, but important later.

**What affects supply and demand?**
Demand and supply curves can each be shifted left or right. When demand moves to the left (less aggregate demand), prices fall. When it moves to the price, prices rise. Here are some examples.

Aggregate demand INCREASES (prices rise) in Diablo 3 when...

* The supply of gold among buyers increases (gold is generated 'from thin air' all the time
* More people start playing the game
* People get more geared
* Certain types of items become more desirable via patches (for example

Aggregate demand DECREASES (prices drop) when...

* People choose to shop at the RMAH
* People stop playing the game
* People become geared to the point where they no longer need upgrades
* The supply of gold among buyers decreases (via transaction costs, etc.)
* Certain types of items become less desirable via patches (for example

Aggregate supply INCREASES (prices drop) in Diablo 3 when...

* People farm and craft more items (this is also constant)
* More people start playing the game
* The rate of items being farmed/crafted is increased/made easier via patches and/or new farming routes

Aggregate supply DECREASES (prices rise) when...

* Suppliers choose to sell on the RMAH
* Drop rates are decreased
* People stop playing the game

**What does this have to do with gold inflation and the value of items?**
Inflation is not as simple as ""there's more gold, there are also more items being farmed (leads to lower prices). 

Also

* Decrease in ilvl63 droprates from Blizzard
* Increase in # of sellers using the RMAH
* Increase in # of people seeking high-end weapons (eg. more people reaching late Inferno)

Meanwhile, you have prices dropping as a result of the attack speed nerf by Blizzard. All attack speed items have decreased in value primarily because their demand curve has shifted left. Additionally, 700-800dps 1handers and 900-1000dps 2handers have had consistent deflationary pressure for reasons such as:

* More people reaching lategame Inferno and seeking more powerful weapons (eg. demand for weaker weapons is lower)
* Continuously greater supply of these weapons

**Conclusion**

Though this is a basic overview

* Just because prices on SOME items are rising

* Investing in items as an alternative to gold is not necessarily logical. Even in the real world

* The constant influx of gold to the economy via farming (vendoring items

* The RMAH does not necessarily cause pure increases or decreases in price on the GAH. Though some suppliers left the GAH (decreased supply -&gt; higher prices)

1340171896.0,vbewf,Data from my entire Act 2 Inferno run as well as predictions for the future,Jipptomilly,312,69,196,"So I've been running a ton of Siegebreaker runs on my Monk

* The run took about three hours. I cleared out 35 champ/elite packs and all three bosses.


* I had about 34k damage with the BoH buff and 17% base magic find.

* The first four champ/elite packs dropped zero rares.

* The fifth champ pack dropped three rares.

* The 31 champ packs starting from the fifth dropped a total of 51 rares giving an average of 1.645 rares/pack upon receiving my fifth stack. If you include the first four which gave none

* Out of the 57 rares I received from champ packs and the bosses, but there were about 20 of these total, and one of these **was** ilvl63.

* I died thirteen times - five times to one champ pack, once to banelings, and once to regular mobs (those big guys that hide behind their arms + those skeletal axe guys that do too much damage).

* I ended the run up about 60k gold after spending about 100k on repairs. I really wish I kept better track of this information

* I saw ONE resplendent chest in the cave where you get liquid rainbow (the NPC was actually there).

* I skipped almost every bonus cave I saw. I think next time I'll clear everything.

* I potted every time I needed to to prevent death and ended the run with two more pots than I started with (only mentioning this because it can become a gold sink for people who can't heal themselves).

* I didn't keep a single rare or blue to sell on the GAH - they were all crap. I did make about 100 exquisite essence though which will put me way up on gold. I also got maybe 30 tears which sell for way less and zero brimstone.

**Predictions:**

* Boss runs are crap now. Maximizing the number of champ packs you kill after getting five stacks of valor seems to be the way to go. I think farming five stacks in A1 and then doing ponies with guaranteed rare drops and a good chance of at least one ilvl63 rare might be a good idea.

* Considering that I made 160k gold in the entire run and then spent 100k of it on repairs, I don't think it's a stretch to think that gold may rise in value. Sqeezing out an extra 20% gold find on a few of my pieces would have resulted in tripling my net gain of gold over the course of the run. It's definitely something to think about.

* If the 1.1 patch introduces a single great craftable legendary then Fiery Brimstone will probably skyrocket in value.

1339554588.0,uz3qc,Demon hunter here: I'm surprised nobody's talking about the resource of space with respect to difficulty for different classes. So here's my take.,cvet,385,147,376,"As a DH

As many others have mentioned, the DH needs to be able to create space to be an effective class.

I'm currently in A2 inferno and having massive amounts of trouble staying alive (big surprise!), Fast, and the seeming non-impact of Caltrops/Flying Strike/Cold damage against the hardest mobs. (note I haven't included Waller or Arcane, as I find these interesting/challenging because one can react to the situation).

Let me be clear: I'm not asking for a buff, even at max hatred/disc. 

**Example**: I ran into a blue pack of those snakelike things that can turn invisible: Vortex, Arcane. This kind of combination leaves my class with very few options. If I get too close, I'm vortexed in. I'm stopped from keeping sufficient distance by the jailer. When I am vortexed, it's right into arcane/plagued. Even when I wasn't being pulled into a deathtrap, SS didn't always go off in time to stop me from getting one shotted (my ping is &lt; 100).

Simply: I don't call this challenging, can do to avoid it. It's not a matter of skill, just whether the mobs will ""decide"" to vortex me three times in a row. When mobs with only 1 movement-impairment affix roll, I generally have no problem. But when they stack, the *fundamental* way that my class is designed to survive is completely obviated (yes, obviated).

**Potential fixes**: 

* **Jailer**: I love the idea of truly random affixes (i.e. I don't want to see them say ""no jailer + vortex"")

* **Vortex**: I'm not really sure what to do about vortex: perhaps cap the range at a fairly small level and put a more noticeable animation in with a small ""wind up"" to allow players to avoid it. I don't mind dying if I miss my chance to avoid

* **Fast**: Fast is really a death sentence because it never turns off. I suppose this is the idea, and the goal would be to keep the whole pack CC'd while retreating enough to both do damage and regen discipline.

1342654409.0,wsdig,Your precision guide to gearing a fresh Inferno Barbarian,accaris,319,86,115,"A lot of people liked my post [in this topic](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wr5lf/wizards_in_inferno_get_in_here_and_share_your/) on what exactly to search for when you're building a fresh level 60 Wizard to take on Inferno (beyond Act 1.) So I decided to make a similar guide, just like with the Wizard guide (which wasn't even as optimized.)

The obvious goal of a starter Barbarian is to stack a lot of defense, sorry, but that's not my territory (and it's much more expensive.)

**What to search for:**

* Helm: Helm of Command - 80 Vit - Socket (250k or less.) The 8% Block chance is a huge boost in survivability. A similar rare helm with 40 All Resists is approximately the same price.
* Chest: 75 Str - 100 Vit - 50 All Res (150k or less.) Look for sockets to extend the life of this chest.
* Legs: 75 Str - 125 Vit - 45 All Res (150k or less.) Same rule about the sockets. Although you could lower the Vit here to get 60+ res for the same price
* Shoulders: 100 Str - 80 Vit - 60 All Res (150k or less)
* Boots: 80 Str - 70 Vit - 60 All Res (150k or less.) There's a 100k line between 70 and 80 Vit in boots.
* Belt: 100 Str - 75 Vit - 60 All Res (120k or less.) Bump up the Str much past 100 and you're looking at a 50K price difference.
* Gloves: 70 Str - 70 Vit - 60 All Res (75k or less.) Here
* Bracers: 75 Str - 75 Vit - 60 All Res (120k or less.) Again
* Amulet: 90 Str - 90 Vit - 200 Life on Hit (200k or less.) We're sacrificing All Res here to boost Life on Hit
* Rings: 60 Str - 50 Vit - 30 All Res (200k or less each.) If you want to switch it up
* Weapon: Anything with 800+ DPS with a socket. (200k or less.) Choose Rare only, then Mighty Weapons and Axes. We're going to buy a Radiant Square Amethyst to put in the socket, which is another 170k. 
* Shield: 70 All Res - X Block % (100k or less.) You can find Sacred Shields--the highest block shields in the game--with over 20% block for chump change

Some thoughts:

This stuff is NOT underpriced. I didn't buy only the cheapest stuff, and All Res, but also stuff that has Dex (which gives Dodge), Int (which gives All Res,) Armor, and Life Regen. 

Just remember that you're not the Hulk in this gear. You can tank damn near anything, just to get a DPS boost, or, drop a little Vit for Str if you think you can afford it.

1355091988.0,14khcw,Item sinks can't ever help the softcore economy,landryraccoon,323,91,167,"There have been a lot of posts suggesting item sinks to fix the Diablo 3 economy. I think a lot of the suggestions are fun and would make the game better

The reality is this: In softcore

People compare the hardcore economy to the softcore economy and talk about how much healthier it is. There isn't nearly as much item inflation there and you can easily sell your drops on the AH. They therefore conclude that because Hardcore has an item sink (hardcore permadeath), right? Wrong. The key fact of the hard core item sink is that it is  1) Completely Involuntary and 2) TAKES THE VERY BEST ITEMS out of the economy. Nobody ever chooses to permadie in hardcore, and when they do, their very best gear, the stuff they are wearing, is destroyed forever.

Now compare that with softcore item sinks. Basically, stuff that won't sell on the AH and would be vendored anyway, then turns them into a shot at the BEST items. So you would get a huge influx of even more high end loot, which enters the economy and is never destroyed, devaluing the average drop even more.

One key thing about softcore is that EVERY CHARACTER'S POWER STRICTLY INCREASES FOREVER. Every gear slot, nobody is going to willingly destroy their best gear. They'll only destroy the worst gear, or the second worst gear, and they'll only do it if there's a shot at upgrading the gear they already have - again, meaning more item
inflation.

Think about it. If there was a gear sink that required you to permanently destroy your best item (or even have a 10% chance of destroying it) for only a shot at a better item

(Can't see move speed in Adventure stats - 12%)

First up

Secondly


**Build**

So

**Frenzy w/ Sidearm** - great damage output and ratio for Life on Hit. Smite and Maniac aren't bad rune choices.

**Revenge w/ Provocation** - Just... standard

**Wrath of the Berserker w/ Insanity** - Increases damage output, kiting, potions and health globes / wells.

**War Cry w/ Impunity** - Again pretty standard

**Threatening Shout w/ Demoralize** - Even more massive damage reduction. I was taking Demorlize as stopping the ranged mobs from running all the time is pretty damn useful.

**Furious Charge w/ Dreadnought** - Pretty great utility. Kiting, but at times it feels like it's nearly 100%, and at those times this is a godsend.



**Items**


I'm 99% sure I picked up everything I listed here on the AH rather than finding myself

One key point missed off is buying and selling items on AH or other places

Every item here could be improved upon or bettered in some way, Block, Attack Speed, Physical Resistance and Damage reduction from Melee/Elites between all your items is key.

**Helm (of Command)** - I'd call this a pretty key item due to the massive damage reduction you gain from a block, Vit and bonus +% life.

**Shoulders** - I'd say they're fairly crap, the Res All were higher, the Dexterity was Intelligence and there was some bonus Armor or Phys Res or Life %.

**Gloves** - I do and don't like these, Res All and Atk Spd I'd be delighted but in my opinion this isn't an item slot that HAS to be legendary, the best gloves in the game could very well just be a rare.

**Ring 1 - Justice Lantern** - I don't want to keep chucking around the word ""required"" (especially when I'm still looking for better versions of these items myself) but this item is unfortunately one of those. Although according to battle.net a Justice Lantern can only be rolled with two additional stats this one has three

**Weapon** - I sold a 1050k DPS blue for this and I'm a bit unsure (I also made 1mil in the process though...). Unless you have mad Life on Hit jewelry you need a good Life on Hit weapon. This isn't really it. DPS could be higher, could have attack speed bonus for even more DPS, could have a socket...

**Boots** - I fucking LOVE this item. LOVE IT. Got it dirty cheap on AH, I believe I heard the random stats on legendaries can supplement the innate stats so even more bonus Res or Armor would be awesome. Also, if you've not been playing for a while with +Move Speed boots you HAVE to get some in my opinion. It may not be a measurable stat for damage reduction and what have you but it makes kiting and dodging far easier along with the nice quality of life bonus of just getting anywhere quicker, doesn't hurt when you're chasing down treasure goblins either.

**Legs** - Just some really good legs

**Belt** - Item you must simply own #3 - String of Ears. Okay rolls on random stats but you are really only buying this item for one of it's utterly broken stats.

**Chest** - Loads of lovely resistance and a tiny bit of Strength. Could be better and oh christ I'm bored of saying it now...

**Amulet** - I paid 2.3mil for this and would happily pay it again. Mad life on hit stat and one short of a perfect res all stat. Great bonus defence stuff and a socket. The reason for the ruby gem is I was replacing an amulet with over 100 Str with this one. Jewelry is, bonus attack speed, bonus armor, bonus % Life, bonus strength... Just try to (between your three jewelry items) get a good mix of all those lovely things as getting them all on one item seems pretty much impossible.

**Bracers** - Bought these a while back also for their brilliant defensive stats. Could be bette - *boom*

**Ring 2** - This bad boy I picked up a while back off the AH for not that much

**Shield** - THE STORMSHIELD - The final ""must have"" item. I picked this up off the AH and could probably sell it for 5x what I paid. Yes you can get stormshields with over 30% block chance and yes you can get ones that don't have Dexterity and have something more useful instead but this really is such a good item and I can't see myself replacing it for a long

After nearly a month of constant testing and statistical analysis (I logged all my runs in each specific area in act 3 - exp, I compared it to the all famous Alkaizer run.

Barbarians : 

1. Wrath of the Berserker breaks most CC that are on you and make you immune to them for the skill's duration.
2. The relentless passive allows you to use revenge without proc. beforehand. (this one allowed me to survive for very long periods with less than 10% health)
3. Furious charge breaks jailer. Leap attack does not. (update: doesn't break it
4. overpower can be activated during whirlwind without breaking the whirlwind
5. Using revenge will interrupt some long attack animations. It works extremely well on the minions at the end of act 1 that wind up the big red hammer that hits for a ton.
6. Using furious charge while ice balls explode prevents freezing.
7. The barbarian passive superstition says you will take 20% less non-physical damage (This includes arrows and other similar ranged attacks). The way it works is you will take regular damage from non-physical attacks yet you have a 20% chance to absorb the attack taking no damage from it. It will average out to 20% less damage but it is not as consistent as the tooltip states.
8. While leaping in the air you can dodge frozen orbs. It is a good way to avoid them but it is hard to time correctly. 
9. Lightning monsters can proc revange
10. Revenge can also be procced by environmental damage
11. The ancient spear(?) attack when used on a treasure goblin trying to open a portal will yank him away and close the portal.
12.  You can recharge frenzy when you hit destructable items (doors
13. If both Ignore Pain and Relentless are active then you're invulnerable (50% + 65% = 115% damage reduction for up to 7 seconds with rune.)
14. Destructible objects count as targets for Revenge healing and Furious Charge healing and cooldown reduction runes.
15. Both ground stomp and leap with stun rune will stun bosses in Inferno.
16. Ignore Pain can also be activated while stunned

Demon Hunter : 

1. Companion uses the DH's crit chance, your pet will crit 100% of the time. Not useful, but funny to watch.
2. Smoke Screen breaks CC
3. The thunder bola rune allows to stun bosses under hell difficulty. 2 demon hunters can easily stun-lock a boss this way
4. The bonus damage on the Demon Hunter's Entangling Shot rune: Shock Collar scales with attack speed.
5. each projectile shot has its own crit chance. Meaning that if you have sharpshooter and has 100% crit chance and you fire elemental arrow (with nether tentacle rune). Each shot fired before the first shot hits the enemy (+1 second) will hit with 100% crit chance even if the first shot already crit'd.
6. The elemental arrow's lightning and tentacle rune is very effective against an immobile missile dampening rare
7. Demon Hunter's can vault through a lot of spell abilities such as succubus flame orbs.
8. Demon hunters smoke screen gives +15% movement speed
9. Caltrops with Jagged spikes: When an enemy steps on more than one spike

Monks :

1. Activating the Monk's Sweeping wind refreshes the ability's timer and maintains its current stacks. Useful to retain max charges while moving to the next pack of mobs.
2. thunderclap breaks jail
3. dashing strike also breaks jailer
4. Seven Sided Strike allows you to go invul for ~1 sec
5. Blind resets the monsters animation
6. Fear (last rune on BoH) also does so
7. Mystic ally inherits the monk's defensive stats
8. When activating inner Sanctuary Mobs near you (basically on the Area of pretection you summon) will get feared for about 1 second.
9. Serenity does not only makes you immune to CC-effects, it can be activated where other skills are unavailable (such a certain bosses' grip)
10.  You can recharge sweeping strike when you hit destructable items (doors
11. Monk: using Dashing Strike on a mob you're in melee with makes you jump behind the mob. As during the flight you're immune and afterwards behind the mob this means you manually dodge an attack. With slower hitting mobs like Mallet Lords you can manually dodge every single attack while having barely any dps downtime. (on certain mobs, or dark berseker)
12. Serenity can be activated even while frozen. Helpful if you're looking at imminent death because of it.
13. Combination Strike applies an invisible buff that stacks. Using any spirit generator will reset the stacks, you will continue to do 16% extra damage.
14. Way of the Hundred Fists' second hit counts as a single hit for the purpose of life on hit and (probably) procs like chance to fear/stun/etc. The hits can crit independently
15. Dashing Strike doesn't automatically apply the damage/root. It does a fairly slow weapon attack targeting the position where the enemy was when you dashed. If they've moved out of the way they will take no damage and not get rooted.
16. Exploding Palm's damage does not scale with monster HP as more players join the game (need to retest this to make sure the latest round of hotfixes haven't corrected it).
17. Mantra of Conviction's Submission rune can't crit

1315861662.0,kdh50,Some Feedback on the Beta after having played the 5 classes.,BobDoom,255,29,53,"
I am writing this up to provide some reading material for the people who didn't have the chance yet to try it out themselves. Hopefully it will keep you busy

Before going into my impressions of the 5 character classes, and everything dying in 1 hit. Most of the vids of people kicking ass are lvl 10+, who are most definitely wearing gear crafted by the blacksmith (The blacksmith is the source of the best gear in the beta). This is the same for example as dropping a difficulty in D2. Let's say you can clear nightmare, but for fun, you decide to play normal... suddenly everything dies without ever touching you.

The game is not that easy the first time you go through. Monsters do hit you, that is lvl 8 or less. (Normally you kill Leoric around lvl 8-9). My opinion was that it was not very hard , but that it was right for the beginning of the game, and I died once or twice. (to an Arcane enchanted monster, and a bunch of harvesters exploding all at once). We're in act 1 on normal, I didn't expect it to be hard. And even though it's not hard, it's still incredibly fun.

Also, the bigger for longer kill chains. Now, these things rock! You want to perform them! 
Massacre : 10 kills minimum
Mighty Blow : 4+ monsters kill in a single attack, and get exp for it.
There are a few others, or destroying a lot of objects at once. (The wizard is particularly good at that)


Barbarian :
The barbarian was my first character in the beta, and the sound effect of the attack, and dead bodies of monsters flying off from the impact is very satisfying. You feel the strength of the barbarian, and you can see how much weight he puts in his blows. The only problem with that is that it only strikes 1 target, so you have to wait for lvl 4 to get cleave, which is equally satisfying, but kills multiples ennemis at once. For the duration of the beta, or to jump to the next pack. The ability I used to spend fury on was either Hammer of the ancients, it's quick and hurts a lot. Plus
Beta cons : The problem when your barbarian gets too strong is that leap attack doesn't recharge (10 seconds) before you clean everything close to you

Monk :
People have been saying that the monk starts boring, a big 20-30 minutes). It becomes incredibly awesome when you get Dashing Strike, which is your first skill that allows you to zip around. For a mere 10 spirit (out of 200), you can dash and strike to another monsters. If you use dashing strike on empty air, it actually only moves you a little, but if you actually target a monster , you can cross a whole screen. This allows you to chain combos for as long as you managed to have 1 monster in the screen. This is just mad fun. Combined with my beta-favorite spirit generator, The monk became a great character. I felt a bit bad
On the other hand, but that was probably only a result of my gear. I feel that Dashing Strike is a core skill  of the monk, granting him the speed he needs to take advantage of the battlefield and enemy positions.

Wizard :
The wizard is also fun right from that start. From the beginning, and it's not until you get spells like Electrocute or Arcane Orb that you have the ability to run out of arcane power. His pool is quite shallow, though, you only have 100 AP (while arcane orb costs 35, for example). Being in the middle of a pack without AP is definitely bad, and you get mauled while all you can do is shoot your tiny wand. Thankfully , it recharges fast and you can then use a spell like Wave of Force, but I didn't try Disintegrate. Arcane Orb packs a huge punch, it'll have to wait for the real game. I feel like the Wizard is the *easiest* character in these low levels

Demon Hunter :
The demon hunter is also fun, though, once you get it. And this is where I had a dilemna. When I was dual-wielding crossbows, I had tons of fun shooting lots of arrows, but I was firing too fast for my Hatred regeneration, eventually running out. Also, Stuff like bola shot, didn't do a lot of dmg, but fired quite slowly. I had to switch my other skills to compensate for this. With a slow weapon, but right from the start I can see very different skill choices simply based on weapon speed

Witch Doctor :
The Witch Doctor is also a character that benefits from gaining a few skills to be more fun. The zombie dogs are nice tanks, and that's single target. It does good damage, but it's not visually satisfying. There's no knockback, no explosion, just a mob dying in a green mist. (This is my personal opinion, remember!) The Witch doctor started getting much much more fun when I got Zombie Charger. I started being able to score some nice 10-15 kills mighty blows, with the green zombie running forward and decomposing, and the sound is nice. I also have less play time on the Witch Doctor, I found it more fun to move forward close to the melee

Finally, which allows you to check the fabled passive skill menu, and you get to read them all. I saw a leak of those, but they are nothing like the real thing (or current beta thing, I guess). They are very flavory, unless the generic stats booster that I had seen before. Most of them are unique to the class you are playing, and so many of them are good that I don't really know how 3 will be enough.

Here is the show notes that I went by https://docs.google.com/document/d/11b6r8VW0sLPLwjG5FiIob4ODyME7IvEKcFS9532ynvQ/edit


So a couple of viewers followed along and built similar barbs for about 12M each. Right now the AH might be a little stressed for the items I suggested so give it a few days for the availability and price to go back to normal.

***[GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!](http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2010/110/9/8/Good_News_Everyone_by_martynasx.jpg)***

I've created a script that scans your character on the armory

How do you use it? Simple.

- A) **New Builds** - Create a new Build
- B) **Existing Builds** - Login and head on over to your build page

Now

- http://us.battle.net/d3/en/profile/Jesta-1121/hero/1963090

Notice it's the FULL path that shows in your browser

It will automatically create items and equip them

I believe there are still some bugs with character imports, so feel free to reach out with an email if you prefer.

Skills on Builds
---

I finally got around to redoing the ""Skill Chooser"" for your builds. Instead of just displaying them on the page

Once you click it, you now have 3 boxes for your passive and 6 boxes for your actives.

The reasoning I broke this appart is I wanted you to be able to control the order your skills appear in. In the previous version, and a buff would be on the top? Didn't make much sense, so now YOU get to choose the order!

Another thing you're going to notice is the ""Save"" button at the bottom of the list. Skill's don't save automatically anymore

- 1) The old method was super unreliable.
- 2) I found myself changing my skills to see what would happen to my build

The save button also publishes your current DPS/EHP stats to the database. So if you need to update them on the list pages

Item Builder
---

I rewrote the Item Builder from the ground up

The first thing I want to point out, it will gain the set bonuses from that set, and be factored into your build. Yay, no more plugging those stats in where they shouldn't be!

The second thing is, and Armor/Block Chance/Block Value on shields. Tabbing through the fields should work the same as it always has and hopefully it makes it a little easier to see what goes where.

Next up, you'll now find the following stats:

- +Min/Max Damage
- +Min/Max Arcane/Lightning/Fire/Cold/Holy/Poison Damage
- +% Damage
- +% Arcane/Lightning/Fire/Cold/Holy/Poison Damage

The first two are used for damage ranges, but that's coming soon.

The text boxes for the Min/Max fields are a little wider and if the ring says ""+6-12 Damage""

In closing...

Ugh! Brain hurt... too much coding...

Hopefully this update will give everyone a little break and make it easier to use the calculator itself. It kinda blindsided me yesterday when all of the sudden they released their profiles

As always

1343589736.0,xcpeh,Why Blizz is being silent: a Wow story,silentcrs,475,245,292,"So Blizzard has been quiet.  Annoyingly so.  It seems like they've abandoned their community.

However

When Blizzard launched Wow, you could not log in to the forums to find out what was going on.  At one point, everyone went naked on the character select screen just so the systems wouldn't have to load your armor twice.

Blizz went into lockdown mode.  No talk about content.  Very few posts.  People were complaining left and right and a lot of us (myself included) began to feel Blizzard didn't give a crap amount of the community.

Fast forward to today.  Blizzard still has millions of players playing a 7-year old game.  They've had many, communication improved and players were able play the game from a company they loved without having it go down every other day.

Blizzard time doesn't work like other game developers' time.  Most developers would love to have steady releases annually and move communities from one game to the next.  Blizzard expects their games to be played for 10 years or more

Some common retorts I expect:

Q: Wow is an MMO with a monthly subscription.  Diablo is an ARPG.  What reason does Blizzard have to improve it after launch?

A: A couple of things.  There's the obvious monetization of the RMAH.  I'm not going to deny it and that's what a guy like Kotick looks at.  However, etc).

Q: If they went through all of this with Wow

A: That's a good question.  I don't know why.  Personally

Q: Activision has rotten Blizzard to core!

A: If Kotick had his way,,False,self,t5_2qore,False,,True
