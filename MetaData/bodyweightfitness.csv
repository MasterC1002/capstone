1362248761.0,19j6i2,A word on strength training.,SodomizingMexican,781,120,197,"Occasionally, and that the knowledge you may gain will benefit you :)

Before you read on

There are multiple ways to increase strength. These include (but are not limited to):

* Increasing the size of myofibrils (specifically

* Increasing the amount of motor units recruited for a movement

* Increasing the efficiency of said motor units

* Inter-muscular coordination
 
But first and foremost

### Progressive Overload.

Before I discuss *anything else*, progressive overload is something that ***must*** occur. Whether it comes from increasing the weight, adding more reps, or decreasing the leverage of the movement, progressive overload is not optional. 

Take the squat, it *should* be obvious. So how do you get stronger? There are two really simple ways to make progress here; you could increase the volume, or you could increase the weight. Doing either one of these will put your muscles and nervous system under stress, causing them to adapt to said stress by getting stronger. This is the key concept of strength training, forcing small adaptations that over time amount to a very large adaptation. Hypothetically, if you were to add 5-10 pounds to your squat every workout, you could go from 225lbsx5 to 315lbsx5 in a matter of months. 

### Myofibrillar Hypertrophy

It's a simple concept, in case it should ever have to perform such a task again. One of the many ways to do this is to increase the number of myofibrils. Myofibrils are basic units of a muscle that make your muscles move. When they receive stimuli from the brain, they contract. To explain how this relates to strength;

More actin and myosin (the contractile proteins in myofibrils) = more muscular contraction =  MOAR STRENGTH

However, ideally one should get at least 1g of protein per pound of bodyweight, and the same amount of carbs (if not more), and consume more calories than your TDEE (see the [/r/fitness FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/wiki/faq)). 

*it's the actin and myosin proteins that increase in number

### Increasing Recruited Motor Units

Motor units are a combination of a motor neuron and all the fibers activated by that neuron.  There are multiple types of motor units, which is why we focus on them. Since they are primarily used when lifting heavy things, naturally, we want to train them by doing movements that require a lot of force (read: HARD).  This is why the upper rep limits for strength training tend to be 8-12 reps(fore begginers, 5-8 for everyone else). If you can do more than 8-12 reps of an exercise, than the exercise is too easy, and you are not effectively getting stronger. In addition to this, this is not the way to train HTMUs. The increase in the recruitment of motor units is exactly what it sounds like, telling the muscles to contract faster. 

Another factor involved in this is the inhibition of Golgi tendon organs. These are located at both the origin and insertion of the muscle, this effect is maximized when training with 85-90% 1RM. 

### Increase in Motor unit efficiency

I'm just going to take the lazy way out and quote [OG](http://shop.eatmoveimprove.com/) on this one.  ""In untrained individuals, page 13.

Basically

How do we train for this?  Do the movement often. The more familiar a movement pattern is

### Inter-muscular Coordination

I think the term ""inter-muscular coordination"" is pretty self-explanatory.  Simply put, pectoralis major and minor, and the anterior and lateral deltoid head. If all of those muscles were to fire randomly, you would have a pretty hard time doing a dip. Since the body likes to do things in the most efficient way possible, eventually it will learn to fire the muscles in sync to make the movement easier.  This results in an increase in strength on that specific movement. This is generally only useful for beginners, or when learning a completely new movement. As with motor unit efficiency, this is best trained by doing the movement often. Grease the groove works great on this as well.


To sum all of this up

* The movements you do should be **hard**.  You should not be able to complete more than 8-12 reps per set.

* Try to increase the total work you do every workout. Whether it be doing one more rep or adding more weight.

* Once you *can* do 8-12 reps in one set

In addition to this

One thing that I forgot to mention was rest time between sets.  For strength, sometimes even longer.  If you would like some hypertrophy as well, keep the rest times at 1-2 minutes.

They want to know things like ""Is it ok to work out more than 3 days a week?"" or ""Why can't I spend 20+ hours a week training like the professional athletes do?"". I feel that promulgating the information needed to answer these questions would be extremely helpful.

For this reason

Fitness is the effect that you desire to get from your training (for most people here, soreness, damage to your connective tissues, and psychological or emotional strain. 

While working out

While resting

So

* There's nothing special about working out 3 days a week. It's just something pretty much everyone can handle.

* **The key to making good programming is giving yourself enough time off to recover from the fatigue you've induced by working out but not taking so much time off than you lose all your fitness.** If you take anything away from this post

* Overtraining isn't actually a thing; a better name would be ""underrecovering"". It's just a point at which you've accumulated enough fatigue to start noticing it. If you're noticing it

* The amount of fatigue you can handle without underrecovering will increase the longer you've been training.

Push ups - 70

Raised L sit - 35 seconds

Muscle Ups - 6

Squats - 250-300 depending on the day

Height - 175 CM (5 foot 9)

A year and a half ago I joined my school's Full On Fitness class for 15-16 yr olds and stuck to a program 5 days a week 80 minutes a day and these so far are my results

I will be going to bed just after posting this but will answer all (most) questions/advice/criticism when I get up before/during school.

**Edit:** It is 7:42 AM where I am so I'll type my routine out when I get to school in first period or I will miss the bus. The response I have gotten to this was actually overwhelming; When I woke up I was feeling stress/nervous for today due to teenage reasons but I feel ecstatic now.  

**Edit2: My Routine**

**Sunday:** Rest

**Monday:**

 Hard Circuit due to an easy weekend. tends to look like;

2 KM run from school to the park

10x Pull Up

30x Deep Squat

25x Push Up

30x Sit Up

20x Dips on Parallel Bars

25x Lunges Each Side

5 sets of this then a 2km run back to school and I usually get into a pull up competition with a few others which progresses to around 40-50 before class ends.

**Tuesday:**

 Long distance run

**Wednesday:** Small Aerobic Circuit

5x Pull-ups

10x Squats, dips, Calf-raises, Sit Ups.

In this circuit there is no rest between exercises and a 1.5KM run after each set

**Thursday:**

Near our school we have a thing called the Trugga track.

1.5KM run from school to the base of the track. 3KM to the top and 3KM back down. It is basically a very steep muddy hill with a stair case built in that leads to the top. I am yet to run the entire thing including there and back.

**Friday:**

Repeat of Monday or Wednesday depending on how I am feeling.

**Saturday:** 

Rest

Each session lasts for 80 minutes apart from Wednesdays. Monday and Tuesday nights I have an Intermediate and Advanced Muay Thai class that last 90 minutes.

I started a year and a half ago at around 5 Pull-ups

Its a 5 day a week program, and rest times are very important, do not alter them.

Here are my numbers:

**Week 1:**

Day 1 - 5/5/4/4/4

Day 2 - 1/2/3/4/4/3

Day 3 - 3/3/3 pullups

Day 4 - 9 X 3

Day 5 - ( I repeated Day 2) 1/2/3/4/4/3

**Week 6:**

Day 1 :11/9/7/6/5

Day 2 : 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/5/4

Day 3 : 5/5/5 Pullup

Day 4 : 9 X 6

Day 5 : (I repeated Day 1) 12/10/8/6/6

As you can see my numbers have grown exceptionally. For instance doing 9x3 week 1 and doing 9x6 week 6 may not seem like much

Also the program has you do a 3 sets of pushups every morning. I did do this

As for muscle gain, getting bigger wasn't my primary goal, getting stronger is, but standing in the mirror and flexing my arm and seeing a bicep is a giant confidence boost.

Finally for those of you interested in this program but don't want to quit your normal workout you can supplement it. This is what I did. On  M/W/F I did not do the morning pushups and evening pullups instead I worked the rep ranges for the pullups as my first exercise post skill work. And did my pushups in the same workout as well.

I've tried looking at the [Drills and Skills webpage](http://www.drillsandskills.com/articles/) and the [Monkey Gym](http://www.tinyurl.com/handstandpdf), Full Body Circles, and Front and Side Leg Swings. 

For the other exercises I'm still not sure what the Open Tuck L-sit is

Soreness or DOMS can mean a lot of different things. [Sinjy the physiotherapist helpfully talks about them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1clyah/psa_soreness_doms_the_burn_and_whether_or_not/c9ia5p3)

'The burn' is what you want to feel during an endurance workout. It is not a goal or indicator of a good workout in the context of strength.

If you're not 'feeling' pull ups in your lats enough or pushups in your chest or whatever other exercise you might be feeling in the wrong place, that's what's happening: you're feeling it in your weakest link. Which is exactly as it should be. Training your weakest link is infinitely superior to building up your strengths and ignoring your weaknesses.

So if you can't do 10 pushups but are worried they aren't 'targeting your chest' properly

EDIT: As far as indicators of a successful workout session, to the extent of my knowledge, there isn't a feeling you can feel that indicates a gain in strength. I suspect this is because you don't actually gain any strength until later, when you're recovering.",,False,,1366377694.0,t3_1clyah

So I actually grew 5 cm, except I can feel it a little when I put on certain clothes. I have gotten comments from family that my back looks wider. I'll see how far I can take this!

Diet: When bulking, I basically ate the same things just less. Also stopped creatine and switched to whey protein.

Workout: All bodyweight exercises. I can't afford to go to a gym and theyre kinda far away and I have no car. Took some exercises from Convict Conditioning and basically did a lot of pushups

* Workout quality box changes colors (don't really need this but its fun c:)
* made for the intermediate beginner (2 push 2 pull 1 leg)

* sheet 2 has progressions! Not a finished product! the progression wiki and the beginners image are slightly different. Plus there are some Big gaps in between exercises. GIVE ME SOME EDITS!!!

​Here are the results:

* Of those who could perform a one arm
* Of those who could perform a one-arm
* ​This subject also had the highest total weight lifted
* The highest percentage of body weight lifted without being able to do a one arm was **50%**​.

**Conclusions:** ​For climbers and non-climbers alike, once you reach around the 60% body weight mark it's better worth your time to start training the one-arm muscles more specifically.

Let me preface this by saying some of the results I'm seeing might just be my body remembering not to be lazy because I was doing 7 or 8 max rep sets probably two years ago.  I started out reasonably fit just not as strong as I'd like to be.

**Week 1 day 1:** 5 maximum effort sets.  I did 4/3/2/1/2. I was disappointed at how hard this was and how low the numbers were so I set my training set to 2 thinking there was no way I could do 9 sets of 3 on day 4.

**Week 1, next week do training sets of three.

**Week 3

I also went from 12 total on Week 1

#Update 8-13-2013:

The planche progression section has been revamped.  Thanks to [this note by Ido Portal](https://www.facebook.com/notes/ido-portal/strength-tip-number-1-the-planche/211939012181420)

* Instead

* I have also added [Planche Lean](http://i.imgur.com/ZPTNeDV.jpg) as the first thing one should get used to before attempting PPPU’s.  ([Supplemental Video explains the importance of practicing Dolphin Plank and Planche Leans.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syxvuJ2stCc))

* Also added Elevated Planche Leans.  (Adding just a couple inches of elevation makes it dramatically harder

* In the Skill Work section, dubbed “[THE Handstand Tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99OfU8SXTTo)” is by the RingFrat channel and is an extremely thorough video.  The other two videos ([#2](http://gymnasticswod.com/content/handstand-against-wall-progression-pt1), [#3](http://gymnasticswod.com/content/handstand-against-wall-progression-pt2)) are by Coach Carl Paoli from gymnasticswod.  They both say the same thing in different ways.

#Update 8-12-2013:

Leg-Day (“Day 3″) is looking substantially more badass.  It is my goal to make this section very thorough because it's commonly said bodyweight-exercises are lagging in leg work (and it's true

* Just added “[Cross Reverse Lunge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVXWpZ2emHA)” and a very challenging “[Behind Leg Pistol Squat.](http://youtu.be/Vs841TMp1VE?t=2m8s)” (cued at 2:08

#Update 7-29-2013: 

* Added [“Bird Dog”](http://i.imgur.com/Fjm4tqj.jpg) to bodyline exercises. Also

* Also

#Update 7-28-2013:

* Add a “[Pull to Inverted Hang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrlNLF-XkJI)” to your pulling routine for even more front lever dynamics.  Follow the usual progression protocol: First get used to doing it while tucked, then finally, from a straight front lever position for ultimate badassery.  In the video he does it from a L-hang position, which is yet another variation.

#Update 7-21-2013:

* Add this “[Seated Elevation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMEDFIwkGmI)” exercise to your L-sit progressions.  Even if you’re not as flexible as the man in the video

#Update 7-17-2013:

* Added [Casio watch](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002J4UBJ0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002J4UBJ0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=antranikorg-20) recommendation in supplemental section to use as countdown timer to hit your isometric holds and rest times.  The watch has a feature that automatically repeats the countdown timer.  This has made my workouts super-duper-efficient.

#Update 7-1-2013:

Added explosive workouts to the Leg section:

* [Deck Squats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncVRPnyWnVg) and [Squat Tuck Jumps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ17ap1Khpo).

* After you master 3×10′s of those two

* Then take it a step harder with [Jumping Deck Pistol Squats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujo-xTeLmiU) (do Pistol Squats as your warm-up set).

* Also adding [Inverted Hang Pull-Ups](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s3KEYtHE9E) to One Arm Pull Up progression.  

#Update 6-29-2013:

* Added [False Grip Hang](http://gymnasticswod.com/content/false-grip-progressions-pt1) and [Russian Dips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtXMZgQOOpE) to the Muscle Up Progressions.  This should tremendously help build a much more solid foundation before trying strict or kipping muscle ups. [More details here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1hbsns/new_prerequisite_for_muscle_ups_false_grip_hang)

#Update to supplemental sections

* I have added slackline specific exercises, it's an EXTREMELY powerful tool! The slackline moves so much, it wakes up and calls for more stabilizer muscles, the same way the rings do when you first transition to them from a p-bar.  Try bird-dog, L-sit, peacock pose and shoulder stand on it!  Yogaslackers on youtube is the business in this regards.  If you could do an L-sit while keeping a slackline still, it becomes ridiculously easy on the ground.  

There are also more random intermediate/advanced moves in the supplemental section now such as...

* [Reverse Pullover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuPSoMRwQF0) (Pulling)
* [Korean Dips](http://youtu.be/wzg_guVxYZM) (Pushing)
* [Back Support](http://youtu.be/QRJBDzFCnA8) (Support)
* [Toes To Bar](http://youtu.be/WvNQGX6gIjI) (Core
* [Knees to Elbows](http://youtu.be/jNbjurAiZK4) (Dead Hang)
* [Knees to Elbows](http://youtu.be/jNbjurAiZK4) (Kipping)
* [Gymnastics Kip](http://youtu.be/jNbjurAiZK4) (Skill)
* [Elbows to Knees](http://youtu.be/c0KIxrAHzyQ) (Core)
* [One Arm Toes to Bar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEV28ms0OEA) (Core)

The following progressions used to be part of the Planche Progression

*     [Frog Stand](http://smittenblog.com/storage/bakasana.jpg) (aka [Crow Pose](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW4NYacLCKg))
*     [Advanced Frog Stand \(aka Crane Pose\)](http://askinyourface.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/crane-pose-bakasana.jpg) (straight elbows
*     [Advanced Frog Stand with Hip Extension](http://www.globalbodyweighttraining.com/wp-content/uploads/Frog-Stand-with-Hip-Extension.jpg)
*     [Elbow Lever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-nPixlxjk8) (aka Peacock Pose) (more of a balancing move than pure strength)

Which got me researching.  Which brings me here.

The OP in the previous post asked why endurance training was so frowned upon in this subreddit.  Our helpful BWFers answered that it was more a case of working towards your own goals; and that if hypertrophy and strength were amongst those goals

Essentially

Some studies have even found that high level athletes can still see an improvement in endurance through strength training if the exercise has some [specificity to the sport](http://www.saskathletics.ca/pdfs/maximal%20strength%20training%20improves%20aerobic%20endurance%20performance-Hoff.pdf).

The news is even better for the typical new-to-fitness poster in this subreddit.  If you're just starting out the sweet effect of [newbie gains](http://sportsmedicine.about.com/cs/strengthening/a/aa123098a.htm) will see an increase in your endurance even if you're training strength.  Even if you're already at a steady-state performance level in your chosen endurance pursuit

What does all this boil down to?  Unless you're at such a high level in your chosen pursuit that only improvements in technique can improve your performance

the alien UFO mothership is sending strong brainwaves that erase the knowledge from the minds.

That is why is people having read the FAQ ask questions that are answered in the FAQ.

That is why strong protection is needed. After having read the FAQ

In general I'm a really nice guy, I will buy a shotgun, find out where your live, and personally blast off one or possibly two of your feet. You've been warned.

With that out of the way

*Concerning yourself with the capabilities of your muscles rather than your ability to perform movements is usually overcomplicating simple matters and leads beginners to do stupid shit*

Once you get a bit further into training and learn a bit more about how the body works and all that, if you're at that point, or when you get to that point, you'll know.


**Less Is More**  
Thinking about moving is inherently simple: you've got pushing, you say ""pull something up from the floor"", and they instantly know what you mean. Had you said ""short quad contraction to extend the knee followed by major effort from the hamstrings and glutes to extend the hip while the erector spinae and latissimus dorsi isometrically contract to stabilise the trunk"", you would've lost most of them at ""quad contraction"".  
Of course

Basing your programming around movements works pretty well. 2 pushes
Of course, you can consider which muscles are involved and what may be worth working on specifically. Not to say that it's absolutely necessary. After working a lot with neutral and supinated grip pulling, I found I was weak in pulling with a pronated grip. So what did I do, isolate my brachioradialis? No, I simply did a bunch of pronated grip pulling and that worked just fine.

Then there's structural balance: you want certain muscles to be stronger than others, not necessarily I don't think. You see, your body evolved to move. As long as you are moving correctly (whatever that may mean), the right muscles get strong in the right amounts, and you don't have to worry about the strength of your rear delts or rhomboids. If you have an imbalance, then it could be a good idea to isolate those muscles, but if you follow a sensible training program

Furthermore, ""I want to do an L-sit"", ""I want to move better"". Instead of trying to work on individual muscles that are involved in that activity, why not just work the movement itself? The SAID principle (specific adaptations to imposed demands) states that the body gets better at what you ask of it. If you do a lot of pullups, you specifically get better at pullups. If you move a lot, you get better at moving. Kind of obvious, really.  
Not being strong enough to perform the movements is not an excuse. You can scale anything down to absolute rock bottom. Can't do planche isometrics? Do planche leans. Can't do planche leans? Do planks. Can't do planks? Do planks on an incline. Can't do planks on any incline at all (even against a wall)? Okay

What if you are a runner? Squatting and deadlifting is very helpful for running, or just ""to make your legs stronger"". Anyone can see how that works: running is something you do with your legs when you want to go somewhere quickly [2], so getting stronger legs will help out. That's the entire point: thinking about muscles is just overcomplicating things.  

**Beginners**  
I'd like to point out that I don't think beginners are stupid or anything; they simply haven't build up the requisite knowledge, but let's not consider those for a bit.

If a beginner makes a program based around training muscles you get shitty workouts consisting of only pushups, because abs, pectorals and calves are all the beginner knows. Sure, it's better than not working out at all, but it's still a horribly ineffective workout for both performance and size gains. A beginner knows not nearly enough about his body to create a good workout based on the principles of hitting muscles, and you'll have to teach him a bunch about how to body works and what exercise involves what muscle, and then they have to parse and store all that information, and all the time they start doing shit like adding exercises for their forearms and rear delts
Virtually everyone understands the principles of ""pulling"" and ""pushing""

Then there's also the issue of ""weak links"" with beginners. Beginners often feel they are lacking in the biceps, most commonly, in the chest. A particular pet peeve of mine is beginners posting in /r/bodyweightfitness asking about ""how do I train my pecks"" because they ""are a weak link"" or ""lack size"". Partly because ""pecks"" is the plural of a basic Flying-type Pokémon move and not a muscle, but mostly because their chest isn't a ""weak link"" or ""lacks size"". It's just overall weakness and lack of size that is the culprit, and their overall shape is what they should be working on. Worrying about the chest isn't going to do a beginner any good.

**Nuances**  
Like I mentioned above
For instance
The common factor in these situations is that *something is off*. Plateauing isn't the end of the world (though it can certainly feel that way)

**Conclusion (finally!)**  
Anyhow, so I've provided one below.


**TL;DR**  
*Concerning yourself with the capabilities of your muscles rather than your ability to perform movements is usually overcomplicating simple matters* because:

* Thinking about pushing
* Structural balance takes care of itself if you train movements
* Most people's goals are movement based

*It's also something that leads beginners to do stupid shit* because:

* A beginner knows only a couple of muscles
* Beginners tend to leave out important parts of the body in favour of the more superfluous things
* Beginners always think they have weak links or lack size somewhere

THIS IS NOT DOGMA

Hey all

**About Me:**

 * Male
 * Height: 5'7"" (170cm)
 * Weight: 172lbs (78Kg) (YIKES!)

**About my Physical Condition:** I tried out the [BW666](http://www.fitness666.com/p/bodyweight-666.html) program a couple of days in January

**My current strength 'feats' from 3 weeks ago:**

 * 6x6 pushups
 * 6x30sec handstand
 * 6x3 chinups
 * 6x6 hanging knee raises
 * 6x6 dips with legs on floor
 * 6x6 bulgarian split squats

That is all. My dream is to be able to do a handstand by July (birthday) and perhaps keep practicing to be able to do a handstand walk before the end of the year? Is that too ambitious?

I know there is the FAQ on the side bar, it was mostly about increased strength (which I'm sure I'll need) but did not include much on the balance side of things?

1367844437.0,1dsezq,The first negative review of Ido Portal I've come across. Any more out there? Might be of interest to people considering his online coaching.,red1392,106,19,27,"So looking through some old threads on Ido, especially for people who may be considering paying $1000 for the 3 months of online coaching.



&gt; Hi
I thought for the sake of balance it was time that someone that has had a negative experience with Ido put something out there. I was also a fan of Ido and his impressive feats of bodyweight strength also his no nonsense approach. 

&gt; Before I start let me give you some background on me I have been training with traditional weights for a long time and had achieved reasonably impressive results Im 5 10' and have weighed in at 90kg with 6% bodyfat so I understand training and also hard work. However the type of training that I did also brought with it a range of problems to quote Ido himself a BMW body with a volkswagen's performance. Extremely tight hips

&gt; A year or two ago I started moving slowly to more bodyweight orientated training after seeing some videos of hannibal for king and finding the website gymnastics bodies. I started messing around mostly with no clear understanding of what I was doing. After stagnating and becoming frustrated with the lack of resources available that were individually tailored I finally decided to bite the bullet and fork over the money to try Ido's 1 on 1 online coaching. 

&gt; As I said earlier Ido is in fantastic shape and has some amazing marketing abilities but his online coaching was probably the greatest waste of money I have ever spent in my life. To start with for $1000 you don't even get an individually tailored program I bet I could post my program and It would look exactly the same as the guy who gave it a positive review. To highlight this fact I explained in detail my lack of shoulder flexibility prior to starting what was to be my first 6 week program. Included in that first program was a elevated bridge

&gt; After questioning him on some of the above issues you are made to feel as though you are weak and he could barely be bothered responding to your question. I eventually just gave up and notched it up to experience. He even boasts about the fact that people pay him this ludicrous sums of money and then just disappear

&gt; I have read alot of his work he has also previously stated that online coaching is rubbish yet again he is happy to do it and willing to take your money. I also love the fact that every so often he takes somebody who was a stuntman

&gt; I will let everybody make up their own mind but here is a summary of the facts. For $1000 up front you get 2 generic cookie cutter programs of which you have to find video's and descriptions of the exercises yourself online

&gt; If people are really interested in bodyweight training then there best bet is to go and look at the resources available on gymnasticsbodies.com. Christopher Sommer is where Ido got most of his ideas from anyway and for a fraction of the cost you will get much more in depth information as to how to progress towards your goals and a community who is supportive of you no matter where you lie in terms of your performance.

A while back I asked a question here about lower body exercises beyond the pistol squat.  Some good discussion was generated about using plyometrics and sprints to build power.  Since that post

Many of you are already familiar with ""the shrimp""

Pistol Squat variations:
The second variation in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0s-0vlHwLc&amp;feature=player_embedded) is called a ""renegade pistol"".  Personally I have found it surprisingly difficult.

[This guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jzond9erQsk&amp;feature=player_embedded) demonstrates another variation that involves jump switching legs at the bottom of the squat.  He also does a squat similiar to the beginner version of the shrimp

[This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeggUI8s9fM&amp;feature=player_embedded) shows a variation starting at the bottom of the squat in a seated position.  At 1:25 he switches to sitting on both legs.  

[Three more variations](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=4TItHzz0VMw).  The last one appears to be a version of the allusive ""warrior press"" that I asked about in an earlier post.

[Twister pistol](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=The_YYrL24M&amp;list=UUGj8AXmVRz7d2wkJj_xP5ZQ&amp;index=41&amp;feature=plcp)  I haven't tried this yet

[Five more variations](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDhxwtkhtA8)  The first three seem to be playing with starting and stopping the movement in different places

[Pistol squat walk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urQs6SMn60k)  This doesn't really add anything new to the movement itself

No video of this one, at least).

**EDIT:** I left off [Alkalvadlo's variations](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDzWem7CfIg)  He plays with changing the position of his arms.

This consists of leaping (or using a chair) to the achievement point of a well executed pullup,  and your body will have put out a similar level of exertion as one, actual pullup. Plus, it's easy to increase the difficulty: just lengthen the duration of your count (e.g. five seconds versus three) or reps (e.g  five versus three ""pulldowns"" substituted for one pullup).

Other than simplicity, right? I used this approach when I first started using simplefit nearly a year ago after having fallen so far out of shape that I could only do two, good pullups in a row. My personal best is now twenty-three pullups with solid form.

1. It is a fully searchable, Kobo, etc.), iPad, Tablet or viewed on the computer. It has no digital copyright protection and is a non-encrypted, fully commentable, bookmarkable, and the excel 28 KB. Any future changes or corrections are provided at no cost.

2. For those who have previously purchased the book

3. Coupon code ""holidaycheer"" without the quotations is a available until January 31st for $5 off. Coupons are not stackable from what I'm aware.

4. Overcoming Gravity 2nd edition is planned for late 2013/early 2014 tentatively. OG digital edition was my priority project right now


**edit**... since some people asked:

These are the proposed changes for OG

1. all new and more detailed illustrations (3d model) for the nuances of each movement
2. professional editing, etc. 
3. Content wise I'm going to revise recommendations and make more newbie friendly including:
4. separate beginner/intermediate/advanced type sections + programming options so newbies don't get thrown everything at once 
5. more detail on programming according to other activities/sports and for those who are busy and have very little workout time 
6. revisions/additions to the charts
7. more talk on specific mobility/flexibility details and programming that 
8. cleaning up misunderstandings such as skill work
9. SOME legs options (although not true progressions) but it should give many people ideas of how they can train with the legs at home if they don't have access to a barbell.
10. my personal general strength recommendations for progressions to use
11. cheaper price (through cleaning up page count and eliminating specific injury info as it's clear that most people don't use it -- mobility/flexibility will still be there)

If you've read Starting Strength (1st and 2nd edition) it will hopefully be like that where the 2nd edition can stand along for at least half a decade before any revisions are made.

This isn’t a set diet or exercise routine. This isn’t a competition with prizes (check out /r/BTFC for that). This is a group of people working together to better themselves. Whether you want to change a lot or a little, this group will provide you with a place to talk to other people about health and fitness in a completely open and friendly environment. No question is too basic here.

**What’s the format?**

Every morning there's a Daily Goal thread where you can post your goals, Fitocracy challenges, Students, Women Losing Weight) throughout the week to keep us all on track.

If you'd like to join us for the next round, gender, height, and weight (we'll describe how to decipher it all later).

**What are these sprints I keep hearing about?**

You'll see the word ""sprints"" thrown around quite a lot.  Don't worry, we found out that more people stuck around if they could focus on their goals for shorter periods of time and then have a short rest before resuming.  When you set your goals, you can not only set goals for the entire 90 days, but also for each sprint!

**What's the schedule?**

Sprint 1: July 15 - August 13

Recovery: August 14 - August 18

I'm a medium/stronger female, do 20-30 half pushups with difficulty, and can squat close to bodyweight. I can easily do mountain climbing stuff, but find I use my core a lot. I can lift the squat bar over my head, but it is very difficult to hold.  Lsits can't be done yet for extended periods.  I have a lot of trouble with proper form for pushups because my chest, by virtue of being female, will hit the ground a solid 5 inches before the rest of me. I can do a handstand if I start against a wall first. And no

I have been dealing with a left shoulder problem for the last 4 months so my progress isn't as high as it should be. This is because I can't externally rotate my arm due to fluid in my bicep tendon, my physiotherapist said it'll be 4-8 weeks until it's back to normal, doing a series of exercises to lengthen the process. I break easily. 

My diet consisted of 

WO Days: 3400 calories / 500g carbs / 50g of fat 

Rest days: 2300 / 70g of carbs / 130g of fat

Basically I've been doing wall handstands for ages

What's helped me today is realising just how important the hands are to the handstand (I know, that's exactly how you should do it in a handstand.

The key thing is that the balance should be focussed on the underside of the finger knuckles

A nice way to find that point is to stand up facing a wall, then the finger knuckles, then the heel. This is an exaggerated way to show what you feel happening when balancing in a handstand.

Then, try that flexing motion. You should hopefully feel the differentiation of the areas in the hands, even though your balance won't move much since you are propped up against the wall. So, push away with your feet slightly and try to feel how the balance shifts when pushing through different parts of the hand. 

If it works then you should be able to start balancing freely for longer periods. Your hands should also feel pretty hard worked.

I hope this helps someone who's been in the same position as I have.",,t5_2tf0a,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/qlo8n/finally_realised_how_you_balance_a_handstand/

Goals: Mainly hypertrophy at the moment as I'm seeing strength gains

I started out a few years ago and I could maybe do 2 pullups. I'm now at around 15 max pullups. So, I can do one-arm pushups, etc. But, I've seen little or no hypertrophy.

I've used TDEE calcultors, when I gain weight, it's usually fat. I feel bloated and, well, fat.

I recently changed my routine to 4 sets instead of three. I'm hoping this helps

My routine is (3 days/week)(reps are until failure):

Pullups (40lbs weighted) (4x7)

Pushups--different variations (40lbs weighted) (4x8)

Dips (40lbs weighted) (4x8)

Inverted Rows (40lbs weighted) (4x10) -- rows don't seem like a challenge at all

My off days are 5min handstand progression/planche progression, Hanging Leg raises 3x6.

I'm doing 2.5mins rest between sets for every exercise.

1361862424.0,198xdk,I just finished 3 months of online training with Ido Portal AMA.,Skiingjoo,63,6,104,"I see a lot of people asking about what its like/is it worth it to train with Ido online. So here is my writeup. 

**My history:** I have been doing CrossFit for over 7 years now. Any of my gymnastic experience was from Crossfit (so not a ton). I met Ido while I was running a CF gym in Israel. I got a chance to train with him one-one-one and was impressed by his knowledge and desire to teach. 
My abilities beforehand. I could do a decent tuck planche, a crummy press to handstand, handstand pushups (Freestanding). I thought Iwas in good shape, but by Ido's standards I was ""Shit"".

**is it worth it:** If you have the money, then yes! You will get three months of programing for $1,090. You will be expected to train for 3-4 hours a day up to 6 days a week. If you can't commit to this, its really not worth your time. Expect to work HARD. 
If you are looking to be treated with kid gloves, Facebook and check out his Youtube. 

**What you get for your money**: You will have to first send in a video of yourself doing some movements from a list Ido sends you along with your goals. Expect to be criticized
You will then get sent six weeks of programing. You are then required to make another video of you performing all the movements. Expect to do things wrong and resubmit. Once you are given the all clear you will get started. 
Once five weeks rolls around you will make another video of your progress and submit it. Expect good feedback and tips mixed with the usual ""I know women stronger than you"". 

**My Results** My flexibility has greatly improved
I can now:
* Hold a fully extended handstand.
* Solid Press to handstand.
* Fully extended front and back lever.
* Multiple Freestanding handstand pushups. 
* On my way to a one-hand handstand.
* 10 Sec Straddle L sit from the floor.
* New handstand hold is 33 seconds. 
* One arm Chin-up is now well within my reach.

I've never been able to stick with any program more than 6 weeks. Motivation isn't the issue; I love exercise/being outside/pushing myself/blah blah. I just always feel like I'm doing everything wrong. 

Wrong routines, wrong whatever. I genuinely don't know how anyone ever succeeds at improving themselves because it feels like there are a thousand variables that you have to have perfect or you just don't get any results whatsoever. Plus maybe I'll just find out I've got some weird condition or lasting injury and just mess myself up more.

I see all these awesome posts from people who are banging out flagpoles and planche pushups and clapping handstand pushups and have genuinely no idea (despite reading way more training literature than neccessary) how you get to that. 

I do work out regularly and love it while I do it but I feel like I'm never going to be able to do any of this right and be stuck as a hundred forty pound weak shit the rest of my life. 

Anyone who has dealt with something similar have any idea how to figure all this out? Thank you for bearing with me.

tl;dr: Everyone is doing something right and I don't know what it is

1372781704.0,1hi5vu,Hanging with relaxed shoulders at the bottom of pullups,eshlow,55,5,20,"OK

There's generally two key points that I want to make.

* Hanging at the bottom of pullups where the GH joint is approximately in end range flexion can aggravate some people's shoulders, and it can vary depending on injury condition such as tendonitis, impingement, bursitis, or others. So it is not for everyone.. if you've had previous injuries in your shoulders and relaxing at the bottom is bothersome I would suggest not doing it.

* However

Basically

Note that the muscle spindles involuntary kick in for other movements where the humerus is being pulled away from the GH joint such as deadlifts. So there's nothing really inherently bad about that; it's just the body's way of preventing a possible injury condition just like the muscles getting tight when you stretch them towards any other end range of motion. 

There's some slight benefits in getting the scapular muscles through a bit more range of motion

Now if anything can hypertrophy the abs and shock them into growth its going to be very different from their postural supporting design. The best I've come across are... BACK TUCKS. Yes
I remember a case where one of my students took on a challenge and decided to perform 120 back flips for time - as quickly as possible. We like doing shit like that from time to time. She finished in under 30 min

So, crunches, sit-ups, garuda, gyrotonics, 6 min abs solution, kb ab circuit, but please

**An intermediate is someone who can't progress linearly.**

Linear progress is when you progress from (more or less) workout to workout. If you stay at the same reps of the same exercises at the same weight for a full week, and your programming has to become more complex in order for you to progress.

I've been working out more or less since September 2012. Started with Insanity (finished the entire program) before moving on to Convict Conditioning sometime in Jan (and yes I did read [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ualu6/convict_conditioning_changed_my_views/c4trv8z) before starting on CC). I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/17df1z/should_i_stop_bulking_i_think_im_gaining_fat_more/) my back story in r/fitness a couple of months ago.

Anyway, but I find it a bit lacking, and boring. Anyway below are my goals and routine.  

**Stats:**

* Male
* 24yo
* 5'9"" (175cm)
* 165lbs (75kg)
* Waist is around 32 inches  

**Main goals I'm working towards:**

* Do 1x5 reps of handstand press
* 15 secs hold free handstand
* Do 1x5 reps of muscle up
* Do 15 secs hold L-sit
* Cut down to 70kg from 75kg while maintaining or gaining a bit of hypertrophy.
* Create a fundamental base strength for bodyweight movements.  

**Routine**

*Skill work*

* Wall handstands
* Foot supported L-sit
* Parallel bar support

*Strength work*

* 3x8 reps pushups
* 3x8 reps parallel bar dips
* 3x8 reps pike handstand pushups
* 3x8 reps rows
* 3x8 reps pull ups
* 3x8 reps bodyweight squats  

**A couple of questions:**

* For parallel bar support
* I want to work towards both handstand press and muscle up. But that means I have to include two vertical pushing exercises (dips and handstand pushups). Will this cause an imbalance?
* As I'm just starting out
* How long do I have to hold my handstands and L-sits?
* I'm still confused about the difference between strength and skill work. What I get is that skill work depends mostly on balance the more you practice a particular movement.
* I don't have rings at the moment. Can I still do a tuck front/back lever on a pull up bar or monkey bars?
* I'm planning to eat 500 calories below maintenance on recovery days and eat at maintenance or slightly above on workout days. Will this still impede my gains in strength since I'm trying to cut?  

Yeah I know I can be very anal over details at times. But I'm heading out to the park tomorrow morning to just do the routine I've set out. Would love to have some feedback on my routine!

today is the start of my ""calisthenics experiment"".

A little bit of backstory:
In 2009 I first saw a video of Hannibal and the other New York people on youtube. After watching a few videos I decided that that's what I want to do!
So I started right away, pull ups, tried some handstands and left. I did this for maybe 1 year and you can guess what my results looked like. But I kept going and found /r/fitness in the beginning of 2011. I read there everyday and got some basic knowledge of training and nutrition. Then I started going to the gym in August 2011 and been there since. 

Now more than 1.5 years later, 5 sets of dips, 5 minutes of tucked front lever attempts, 5 sets of diamond push ups and 5 sets of squats.  
It felt great and I want to continue this and someday when the summer is over again I want to mix it up with weightlifting again. Because I love both. 

I want to see how far I can take it with calisthenics this time

Thanks for reading this and excuse me for my english

Edit- Thank you guys for all your input! I will update this post whenever I get a set price. I am going to try and convince him that we need the price to get down as low as possible as that seems to be the largest complaint. When we actually build one I will make a new post to show it!


P.S. I am not going to make any money off this item... as a salesman I would only get 3.3% (like 20 bucks) of the price in commission as it is (which I will drop if I sell to anyone here also)... Most of our buildings sell very well and cost over 12k. I am just wondering if this product is wanted (since i want it). I can also put this product inside of a building if you want lol.

**Update** Sorry for wasting your time... boss said in its current design it is not possible to be structurally sound... this is why I am not an architect... I will let you guys know if we can get a design that works down.",,t5_2tf0a,1345752888.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/yo8vo/posted_this_idea_in_rfitness_but_figured_it/

1376396311.0,1k9utg,RTO Push Ups - Anyone have a video showing good form?,gejw,56,11,19,"Hi

So i've started RTO push ups and i'm unsure of the correct form. I've looked at the video in the cheat sheet (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYvZXmxBRRY cheat sheet states 'first 11 seconds') but that isn't a correct RTO push up from my understanding? On the vid his rings are only turned out at the top support position for about half a second and then in the bottom position the rings aren't even paralell

I'm particularly interested in hand/arm positioning during the movement because when i'm doing them it seems i have to lean forward and almost end up in a kind of RTO Pseudo Planche Push up with the daunting threat of face planting and smashing my teeth to bits. 

If anyone has such a video or could make one it would be greatly appreciated. 

Obviously if the video is correct then great

Cheers

Edit: Added TL;DR

TL;DR: RTO Push up video on cheat sheet is wrong. Please supply video showing good form and detail on the correct arm/hand positions to prevent me doing a RTO psuedo planche push-up teeth smash.

I currently do Deadlifts and pistol squat progressions on an A-B rotation for leg work and I plan on adding sprints on days I do pistol squats as they're not really that taxing for me as I'm still attempting to get full ROM on them. Plus the weather is nice and I enjoy being outside and running. How should sets and rest look for strength work? I'll separate it into track sprints and hill sprints as I'll probably bounce back and forth depending on the day due to time, not both.

Track sprints:  
I have access to a 1/4 mile track. Not sure what distance would be best for strength work. I'm guessing 100m? I figure for sets do the full 100m

Hill Sprints:  
I was thinking of dividing this into categories of short and long hills divided by time. The park not that far away has a variety of hills, and some steep and long, and some long hills with gradual slopes. Figured I can separate them by the times and by slopes. Something like &lt;20s for short, &gt;20s for long. For short hills something like 4-6 sets with 3-5 minutes rest and for long hills 3-4 sets with 3-5 minutes rest?

1358165624.0,16jq84,Results flattening out? Try a month of German Volume Training with bodyweight.,dansin,58,15,9,"German volume training (GVT) is a routine for non-beginner lifters to pack on some size in a short amount of time. But it's not intended for long term use. I realized recently it works extremely well for bodyweight training.

To summarize the routine you essentially try to do a 10x10 of the same exercise. In the beginning it starts of easy, be extremely careful when you start getting tired, I highly recommend against handstand pushups with GVT.

I believe this routine is great for bodyweight because: 

1. It's the same exercise each time
2. In bodyweight
3. It's simple to do with limited equipment since you don't need to increment the difficulty every set. 
4. It's an easy way to change up your routine every once in a while.

I've been at bodyweight for over a year now and after two weeks of GVT I'm still getting crazy sore which is a feeling I haven't gotten much of in bodyweight. This is the first time since rock climbing that I've gotten sore forearms.

My recommendations for GVT with bodyweight training:

1. Two bodyparts per day a few days per week (depending on time). 

2. Pick an exercise that you can normally do about 15-20 reps of. 

3. Use a timer (90s) between sets.  Track your sets (of course). 

4. Aim for 10x10 but realistically you wont be able to get 10 by the 
6th or 7th set. 

5. Stop at 10 reps

6. DO NOT pick an exercise which failure could lead to injury (such as handstand pushups) as GVT is extremely tiring. 

7. Only do it for a few weeks at a time

In summary

Also I'd love to hear what other people think about GVT with BW fitness.",,t5_2tf0a,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/16jq84/results_flattening_out_try_a_month_of_german/

* For my L-Sit supports Ill use two 25 lb dumbells and leave my heels on the ground. I can hold that for up to 3x15secs.

-2x10 Pistol Squats 

-Freestanding Handstand

-60s L-Sit

-15s Straddle L-Sit

-3x10 Hanging Leg Raises

-3x8 Chin-ups

**Before** - http://imgur.com/a/DqlqR

**After** - http://imgur.com/a/jWDON

**Previous level of fitness** : I got tired of doing the FAQ so I decided to give this a try.  I was doing 3x8 of pull up, and 3x8-12 of different push up variations and the dip and inverted row work.  I was also up to 5 one armed push ups.  I weighed 128ish before the workout at 5'7"" and maybe gained a lb or two after doing it (unsure due to variability in the scale, I did break 130 afterwards which I've never done before, but some days I weighed in at 128).

**Execution of workout** : Very easy to fit in around a busy schedule.  For the first week I did 5 sets of 20 push ups and 5 sets of 10 pull ups and fit them in during study breaks throughout the day (it was finals).  I later upped that to 4 sets of 25 and 4 sets of 13.

**Thoughts** : I *felt* like my chest had gotten larger, but it felt like I had increased mass on my chest.  I couldn't feel any big difference with my back.  The workout gets really boring towards the end, but it works well as a break to other things.  

Personally

I'll be hanging out on this throwaway for the next day or so so if you have any questions

I have not experienced any major back problems in the past year or so but would sometimes feel slight pain when doing deadlifts

I started with the beginner routine and did that for about a month and a half. I then started doing a variation of /u/antranik's routine which is outlined [here](http://antranik.org/bodyweight-training/). I had been doing this routine for about a month and a half before getting my rings two weeks ago. I am still trying to figure out a good balanced routine with the rings.

My routine is split up into three days; pushing day


**Goals**

* Build muscle and just overall stay in shape
* Short term: Freestanding Handstand
* Long Term: PLanche, Flag Pole, Freestanding Handstand Push Ups

---&gt; This arrow will indicate the goal I am working towards with an exercise.

**Warm up:**

Bodyline

* Plank 60s
* Side Planks 60s
* Dolphin Plank ~50s
* Reverse Plank ~45s
* Hollow Hold ~2x30s
* Reverse Hollow Hold 60s
* Going to add Bird Dog in my next work out.

Skill Work 

* Handstand practice (Belly to wall ~45s
* L-Sit Practice (L-Sits are one of my weaker areas so I start by stretching and doing foot supported on the floor for 60s
* Support (before I got my rings I was doing 60s on bars

**Day One: Pushing**

Vertical:

* Wall Headstand Push Ups 3x5 (with 3.5 inch foam block under my head) ---&gt; Wall Handstand Push Ups and eventually Freestanding Handstand Push Ups. 
* Ring dips 3x4 (replaced Bar Dips 3x7) ---&gt; Muscle Ups

Horizontal:

* Archer Push ups 3x6 ---&gt; One Armed Push Up
* Ring Push ups 3x8 (too easy

**Day Two: Pulling**

Vertical:

* Ring Pull Ups 5,4,4 (trying less reps per set but more sets to work on form) ---&gt; Muscle Ups
* False Grip Hang 4x15s ---&gt; Muscle Ups

Horizontal:

* Ring Rows 3x6 ---&gt; Front Lever Tucked Rows (Replaced Bar Wide Rows 3x7)
* German Hang 6x10s ---&gt; Back Lever (Replaced TRX Rows)

**Day Three: Core

Legs:

* Pistol Squats 5
* I was also doing Deep Steps but found my legs were too tired when I would go mountain biking on off days.

Core:(Was neglected before I got rings)

* Hanging Leg Raises 3x6 ---&gt; Windshield Wipers

Horizontal Pulling:

* Tuck Front Lever 4x15s ---&gt; Front lever

Vertical Pulling:

* Hollow Body Pull-ups on bar 4,3 

**Questions**

* Is my routine balanced? If not
* With my headstands
* I would like to start working towards a Planche
* I would like to start working towards a flagpole but I'm not strong enough yet to get up into Vertical Flag. Should I start by doing Tucked Flags with something supporting my legs? Or should I wait until I build up more core strength?
* My core is one of my weaknesses and I can see that reflected in my hollow body position as well as things like L-Sits
* I have been advised by multiple chiropractors not to do deadlifts. (Not specifically because of my history but just because they believe they are bad for your back in general). I don't totally buy this but at the same time I still don't feel totally comfortable doing heavy deadlifts because I have had back problems in the past. That being said
* After my last visit to the chiropractor I tried to find information about deadlifts from a medical perspective but couldn't find anything. Basically what I found is chiropractors say they are bad
* I would greatly appreciate any other feedback. If you think my routine sucks and have a suggestion for a total overhaul let me know. Don't hold anything back

Thanks in advance. You guys are awesome!

Now here's some handbalancing notes:

* Having a teacher to poke at you is a VERY good idea. Having people touch you increases proprioception and helps you move things properly
* Forward flexion flexibility is super important - stretch your pike in between sets of handstands while resting
* Tension Drill: Lie on the floor face down with your arms overhead. Engage your glutes and lift your legs off the ground just like an arch hold (keep them squeezed together and toes pointed!). Keeping the glutes engaged, lift your belly button off the floor (your legs will come down and make contact, that's fine - just keep the glutes engaged). Repeat this slowly for a few reps

I'm sure there's more that will come to me later

If I'm not mistaken the ones that need work in the lower body are the hamstrings

For abs I do planks and knee raises

But I'm not sure what to do with the rest. I did goblet squats for a while but my 70 lbs kettlebell was maxed out rather quickly. I have a hard time doing lunges or bulgarian squats without falling over. So I tried to do a pistol progression. But I've been stuck for months.

I tried the rolling pistols approach but after a few sets I'm mostly out of breath not having felt any muscle used while tumbling around like an idiot. Usually the quads cramp up because keeping the other leg straight is nearly impossible for me.

More direct approaches like glute bridges didn't help either because they became too easy far too fast.
Now I'm not sure what I could do instead. I know I have to work on pistols a little more because I need to train my legs anyway.

I've tried false grip pullups and hangs on the rings and bar, but I'm running into similar issues with each. Whenever I try it I think I must be misunderstanding the grip somehow because it feels so wrong

* I'm not able to fully extend my arms at the bottom while maintaining the false grip. As I extend, right? And is the wrist meant to stay at 90 degrees of flexion the whole time? Or does the wrist angle open up slightly towards the bottom?  

* I get pain/pressure on the top surface of my wrist during the movement

* It hurts on the inside of my wrist where it rests on the ring. This is unsurprising and I assume I just need to grow calluses and HTFU

Last night I tried to work false grip ring rows and ended up doing 7, but I was frustrated by how painful and difficult they were. Earlier in the workout I had done chinups with +40 lbs. for 5, 5, and 8 reps at 175 bodyweight.  

Is there some other mobility or strength work I should be doing before


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**UPDATE**: I went to the gym and got photos of the way I was doing it before, with the rings on the bottom part of my palm, based on the video linked by /u/CaptSimian. The latter felt much better, and with it I was able to do 3 sets of 10 ring rows with a minimum of discomfort.

I've been doing Ashtanga yoga for the past 8 years and am currently working on the 3rd series. (example of the kind of thing I'm working on: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAURP7YNC2g) During the course of a week,  just for illustration see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1LEhr3QWig - start around 2 minutes: he's doing third series, she second series). 

In the course of a practice, elbow lever, tons of squats, with a tuck planche from seated into the bottom half of a pushup and then a dive bomber pushup, and then a jump through to l-sit between each posture (in yoga, just called a jump back and jump through). Eventually there are one-hand handstands and elbow levers, no momentum hand vaults and flips etc (http://www.absolutelyashtanga.com/yoga_5.html). Obviously there is more a premium on twisting and bending in yoga, like I've noted

All this to say, I have started doing 2-3 strength training workouts a week. Sometimes I only get around to 2 of these. TBH, the yoga is the priority, so I want to be able to miss a strength training session here and there without entirely mucking things up. Here is my routine right now:

* Pullups: http://twentypullups.com/week-4/ (I'm on day three
* L-sit: 3x20
* Pushups: I'm doing the Perfect Pushup progressions (http://apankow.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/pp-poster.jpg)
* Elbow-lever: 1x60 (with some skill training for 1 armed)
* Tuck Planche: 2x30
* Wall sit
* Pistol squats: http://www.alkavadlo.com/2011/08/29/the-twenty-pistol-squat-challenge/ (Intermediate)
* Back lever: 6x10 (alternating one leg tucked in)
* Advanced Tuck Front Lever: 5x12
* Ab wheel roll-outs

Questions (besides a general critique):

* How can I work HSPU into this? (currently I can jump into handstand using both legs and also want to eventually be able to pike into handstand)
* Do you feel like I'm missing something? Or would majorly benfit from removing or adding some type of movement?
* Ideas for other fun skill-based things I can swap in and out and/or work on in spare moments (remembering that I want to do all types of movements in one workout?)

**Dissimilar effects of one- and three-set strength training on strength and muscle mass gains in upper and lower body in untrained subjects.**

Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, 157–163
 2007 National Strength &amp; Conditioning Association

BENT R. RøNNESTAD, PER E. REFSNES, FAWZI KADI, AND TRULS RAASTAD

intro:  
&gt; ... report that strength gains with different strength training regimens can vary dramatically from one muscle group to another. Therefore

previous work:  
&gt; ... who observed that leg muscles responded to a greater extent to 3-set strength training when compared with single-set strength training

results of study:  
note: 3L-1UB is 3 sets legs
&gt; The increase in 1RM from week 0 to 11 in the lower-body exercises was signiﬁcantly higher in the 3L-1UB group
than in the 1L-3UB group (... Figure 1 left panel). There were no signiﬁcant differences between groups in 1RM changes in upper-body exercises (Figure 1 right panel).
figure 1: http://imgur.com/4H15W4j

discussion:  
&gt; Based on the results of the present study, meaning they are better trained than the upper-body muscles in subjects not committed to regular strength training. Furthermore, trained muscles seem to beneﬁt more from a larger training volume than relatively untrained muscles. However, if the upper-body muscles are less trained than leg muscles, a greater increase in relative strength should be expected in upper-body muscles than in the leg muscles. This was, however, not the case since relative strength increased more in the leg muscles than in the upper-body muscles. Based on this ﬁnding the opposite conclusion may be drawn; **the upper-body muscles need a higher training volume (&gt;3 sets) than leg muscles to beneﬁt from multiple-set strength training protocols** [emphasis added]. ... found that 6 sets in biceps curl were superior to 1 set during 12 weeks of training in untrained subjects.

Details on procedure:  

- the muscles measured: ""thigh muscles and trapezius muscle""  
- progress measured by: ""The 1RM testing was performed in leg press, seated chest press, seated rowing, latissimus pull-down, biceps curl, and shoulder press""  
- training was ""3 times per week on nonconsecutive days.""

Has anyone heard about upper body requiring more volume, advice from gym bro) that suggest this is a good idea? Or alternatively that it's a bad idea? Off the top of my head, evidence that more volume is good would be grease-the-groove for pullups.

I've gotten pretty scrawny from all the running and I decided I want to gain a bit of muscle and functional upper body strength. 

Last week I started CC. I plan on following the progressions as stated in the book with the specified rep numbers. I've set up a routine

The following is my weekly plan-

Sunday: CC and 3-5 mile run
Monday: 6-10 mile run or 5 miles of interval training
Tuesday: Whichever thing I don't do Monday
Wednesday: CC and 3-5 mile run
Thursday:6-10 mile run
Friday: CC and 3-5 mile run
Saturday:Rest

Here are my questions.

1) Is running going to interfere with my ability to gain strength and size? 
2) Would it be more beneficial to follow CC with the 3x8-10 rep method (like in the FAQ) than the reps specified in the book?
3) Should I be doing CC 4 times a week or will 3 times a week be sufficient?

My ultimate goal is to increase my flexibility and strengthen my upper body. I also want to be able to do handstand pushups.

To maintain a stable midline during pull-ups, and point your toes. Squeeze your butt and balance your ribcage over your pelvis"". I've tested this in the gym, and it definitely feels like a superior position compared to how I train at home (using a power tower where I have to bend my legs to stay off the ground). And may also explain why I occasionally get issues with my shoulders after doing workouts which emphasise pull-ups (Starrett discusses how doing a pull-up from an overextended position - e.g. with your legs hooked behind your body - will create a situation where you're applying torque to your shoulders from an unstable position).

I'm a 17 year old guy (5'8"" 144lbs) and have recently decided that it would be a good idea to get into some body-weight fitness (and some simple weightlifting) for strength. As of right now I've been doing full body workouts 3 or 4 times a week for the past 3 weeks. I was already in good shape to begin with

I've been reading a huge amount on the science behind strength training. I've read about the necessity for caloric surplus for muscle gains

This is what a typical 'routine' looks like at the moment:

I do every exercise with a 60 sec rest between each set. I cycle through the exercises
rather than chest----&gt;chest----&gt;chest---&gt;back-----&gt;back---&gt;back----&gt;legs-----&gt;legs----&gt;legs.
The routine takes me about 45 minutes and consists of 
4x12 rep difficult pushup variation or dips (I say 'difficult' because I make sure that whatever variation it is
3x8 rep one leg squat
3x40 rep one leg calf raises
3x12 dip position leg raises
4x12 elevated feet rows (no chinup bar yet!)
4x some ab exercise like bicycles, or L-sit for as long as possible.

Usually this routine takes me about 45 minutes. At the end of it my arms feel tight and really worked and my abs will feel it if I move them too. Usually I struggle to do the last rep of each exercises near the end of the routine.

Hear are my questions!

1. Should I be doing the cycle routine, chest, legs, legs, legs, back, back, legs, chest legs

2. I've only been doing this for 3 weeks but have had a few issues that have caused some confusion. The last time I did my routine was 2 days ago, but it is usually pretty intense) or I'm not giving myself enough rest between workout days. I've noticed a slight improvement in my L-sit and my pushups feel a tiny bit better, but my curling is definitely worse. My thinking is that either my small muscles (biceps, etc) need more time to recover than abs and chest - which seems odd - or I should just straight up give myself more recovery time overall (like 3 days between workouts). What do you thing I'm doing wrong?

3. How should my exercises FEEL when I'm doing them? Usually in my last 2 sets of an exercises my last rep is pretty much failure or ALMOST failure. Is this too excessive? 

4. I was watching some videos by this guy:http://www.youtube.com/user/jlvi13 who has a bunch of awesome bodyweight fitness videos. He was saying that for his abdominal workouts, but I'm still really not sure.

5. How important is purposely eating more to gain muscle and strength? I've been purposely eating about 400-500 calories more each day and have gained about 1.5 pounds in the past 3 weeks. Again, or will my body naturally start partitioning calories towards muscle devlopment and I will find I'm naturally inclined to start eating more/gaining weight?

I know this is a lot of questions

I have just spent the past two months recovering from an illness

**Here's my situation:** I am currently training for parkour twice a week (Thursday and Saturday). Training usually involves some bodyweight training and what I would classify as cardio. I would like to add weightlifting and cardio and later possibly Yoga or Muay Thai to that regimen.

**My goals:** To develop functional strength and general fitness. What I mean by that is that I am not so much interested in raw strength or aeshetics - I figure any decent programme will get me some of those anywys - but rather in *explosive strength

**The plan:** So, Deadlift; Day B: Squat, Press, Pull-ups). Then I could still go running on my other off days.

**My questions:**

1.) How should I combine strength training and the bodyweight/skills/cardio training? If I am going to add weightlifting, but the FAQ doesn't seem to be adverse to that.

2.) Would SS be a good program for my goals? I know that it is primarily geared at developing strength and not power

3.) How should I go about starting the programming? Does it make sense to work on mobility and core stability before taking up a program? The reason I am asking is because when I went to the gym, which is somewhat notable when squatting (my pelvis tilts a little to the left and backwards). Should I do some single-leg work before jumping into a weightlifting program? If so, what exercises to you recommend.

Thanks!

Well, I cannot get my arms straight during an angled bridge. I have tried different height benches/tables, but I can barely get myself off it. 

Of course I know that overall my upper body is weaker than my lower. I am only at Horizontal Pulls with Pull-up progression - after vertical, although I did 3x8 last time so it might be fair to say that I will be doing Full Pushups next time.

Could it be a flexibility issue instead? I am not very flexible overall. My hamstrings are definitely tight on the lower body and my shoulders look a bit angled forward even when I am pushing them back and down

What do you suggest I could try to get to a better point with this? Maybe a specific stretch or some kind of (weighted?) exercise for my arms?  Should I just wait until my upper body catches up to my lower back in this? Has anyone else had such problem

1345109234.0,yb9rj,Fat chick can't do shoulderstand squats and a couple übernoob questions...,TentacledFreak,36,8,26,"Short story time: I lost 55 pounds with weight watchers last year. 342 to 287 lbs. I stopped doing weight watchers because I started nursing school and I was trying to simplify things to focus on school. This summer my weight creeped up to 302. I had a bit of a freakout being over 300 pounds again so I started looking to change. I started counting calories a little over a week ago and I'm down to 297. 

Somewhere in the mix I was given a weight set and started attempting to lift weights. Mainly because I 1.) often work with BIG patients that need to be moved and I want be strong enough that I won't injure myself or the patients and 2.) weight loss has given me grandma underarms. I was to tone my arms a bit to combat this.

Bench pressing hurt my shoulders

I think I can do this. 

Except tonight I tried doing shoulderstand squats and I couldn't even get up on my shoulders let alone hold myself in that position. So I tried jackknife squats and did reasonably okay with them (Did 4 x 10 trying to figure out where to center my weight. It was a little awkward but my knees don't hurt like when I do regular bodyweight squats.)

So a few questions:

-Is there an alternative to shoulderstand squats I can do before jackknife squats or should I start there? 
-When doing jackknife squats I assume your knees shouldn't cross your toes just like regular squats? Just how much of your body weight do you rest on your arms (10%? 25%?) and do you maintain that or do you lean forward before you push up again? It seemed that by the time I got squated down I didn't have any weight on my arms at all. Just want to make sure I'm doing this right! 
-Any suggestions for bodyweight exercises that I can do in my spare time to work on my triceps?

1333544721.0,rst2c,Starting Power (Vert Jump Training),Cammorak,37,7,12,"**Introduction**

As I wrote this post

But there have been some vert jump and power questions recently and I said I'd post a workout, ""power"" as we know it is essentially a coordination of the force generated by elastic tendon contraction (which can be trained just like muscular) and muscular contraction. The secret to good power generation is all about biomechanics and coordinating these two types of contraction. I'll explain a bit more with the exercises.

Second, and if you have access to them, I would highly recommend doing them, even if only for a few mesocycles a year.

And third, you should need significant rest between workouts. Proper form is far more important than insane amounts of reps or any type of interval training, so rest as if you were weight training (about 2-4 minutes between sets). Try to limit this type of workout to twice a week to allow your CNS and connective tissue to recover. Also, these exercises were chosen for simplicity and are geared for a beginner. More advanced trainees can try other things like squat-jumps, 40-yard dashes, broad jumps, and skipping for distance.


**Warmup**

Any sort of plyometric exercise requires significant warmup for both the muscles and the tendons. Note that everything is done at ""warmup pace."" You don't want to blow yourself out on the high knees or squats or anything. My typical warmup is something like:

25 half-jacks

25 jumping jacks

50 high knees (25 per leg)

50 heels-to-rump (running in place kicking yourself in the butt)

20 bodyweight squats

2-3 minutes jump rope (if you can do 50 rope jumps in a row


**Beginner Power Workout**

*Bunny hops*

These are mostly skill and proprioception work. It doesn't seem like it, you should start making short rocking hops forward. You should land each hop on your heels and roll onto your toes, which should provide enough momentum to rotate your entire lower body using your abs so that you can land on your heels again. This exercise is primarily to practice and learn proper tendon loading in your hips and knees as well as lower leg weight transfer when jumping from standing (i.e., coming up on your toes), not exhaust your muscles. In doing so, it also strengthens your connective tissue. You can identify what muscles you're using to ""cheat"" if they are burning by the end of your sets.

3x15


*Depth jumps*

These help teach the biomechanics of proper loading from a standing position and also strengthen the connective tissue. They also teach proper timing for muscular contraction. Essentially, step back onto the box, don't hop back onto it.

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKtSJc39QNc) is a good video to describe the concept.

3x5


*Burpees*

Everyone loves burpees, but try to keep it one motion. Coming out of the squat, you should be sure to initiate the motion with hip drive first and then use the lower leg. The burpee does a lot of other stuff besides just the vertical jump, but it helps train both the stepping vert jump and the standing vert jump. It also builds the foundational body mechanics for more advanced power motions (horizontal extension and body rotation in the anterior-posterior plane).

3x10


**Conclusion**

That should be enough to get your started. If anything, but like anything, if you are more experienced with this type of workout or are an athlete, you can add a set every week. Keep in mind though that connective tissue and CNS stress are far more insidious that muscle soreness, and you may not realize how much recovery you need. Better to err on the side of slow progress than get injured. Once you hit 5x5 depth jumps, try dropping back to 3x5 depth jumps and adding 3x5 squat jumps. Then add one set to both every 2 weeks. By the end of a few months of the program, you should be at 5x5 depth jumps and 5x5 squat jumps. At that point,,True,t3_rst2c

I tried adding weight but I'm not sure if I'm ready yet to do so. A lot of programs recommend going above 10 reps (greyskull even says 15) before you try adding weight. I haven't seen an explanation yet

I think the main reason why I can't increase my reps is because I can't keep a consistent amount of reps. I think I even lost strength as I remember beeing able to reach 8 reps even on the third set (though I had a one month break inbetween).

I stopped adding weight to try to fix the problem and the last few workouts my goal was 3x8 (again). I don't go to failure on my first set

I don't have such a problem with any other exercises and now I'm not sure how to proceed.

I do them 3 times a week and I only hit my back every other workout with dumbbell bent-over rows (I don't feel them decreasing my chin-up strength). I usually don't hit biceps and if I have the desire I do them after the chin-ups.

I recently began exercising on a whim, but physically I feel much better as well. To continue to fight my depression, I want to work out every day, but the FAQ says novice and beginners should only do 3x a week. Another thread said that, as a novice, the exercises are too taxing on the body to do every day, and that at least a 1 day recovery period is optimal. I accidentally discovered the truth of this after over doing it on handstand practice

For reference my goals are:
#1 - feel good. Exercising has helped me with depression and feel more energetic. I don't want to stop even for a day
#2 - get stronger. I've never been physically strong in my life
#3 - look sexy. After I gain some muscle

My stats are: age 27

Routine has been previously: even days- hand stand practice, l sit practice, squats.

I hadnt been doing the warmup or mobility exercises
Didn't think they were really important. Now

The routine I'm planning will probably be:
Odd days: warmup from the FAQ and jumping jacks, support practice, push ups, incline rows, dips, assisted pull ups, squats
Even days: warm up

* Buy at least 4 meters of around 38mm polyester webbing (best to get this from an outdoor store that sells climbing gear since it's usually gonna be cheaper this way but if not you can get it online easy enough
* Cut in half
* Tie a knot near one end of each length using a rag or stray material to make sure the knot is very thick (see pics below).
* Open your door
* Close your door over the webbing and pull each length firmly to make sure secure.
* Do a couple of test pulls on each one with your whole body weight
* If your a soft cunt get some towel or fabric or something soft to wrap around your hands for grip

**Photos:** [Here.](http://imgur.com/a/0AwZJ)


This was my solution for not having a doorframe that I can put a pull up bar in and not having anywhere nearby to do pullups

I also find this better than a pull up bar for for leg lifts since it has the same kind of feeling as wall bars.


For rows I tie mine end-to-end and just have a stick I found ages ago tied in the second length.

Hi folks

About 6 months ago I had spinal fusion for scoliosis. A week in hospital, and I had a straight spine! Wahey!

Here's what I can (very) comfortably manage at the moment:

- Walking to and from work
- Go out with friends clubbing/dancing for most of the night
- Swimming confidently at a good speed (although breast stroke is a little tricky)
- About 20 pressups confidently

I asked the doctors and they have advised that after about 3 months, swimming, etc. I'm now at 6 months in and they didn't have any further advice - ""play it by ear"" - which isn't much help!

All I know right now is that I am quite slim and have virtually no muscle (body fat approx 15%). I'm looking to both build more muscle

I saw the ropes online that come with the end already on them

Anyway


First I tied the end of the rope so it wouldn't unravel (and it is also an extra safety measure so the bolts that I use won't slip out)

Next I cut a length of pipe

Here you can see that I weaved a piece of chain into the clamp (and put the bolts through the chain)

Then I put a hose clamp around the bottom

Here is the finished product.  Note that I also added another hose clamp at the top for a backup safety measure.

Most of you suggested me to take a rest week and I did. I continued to workout but only on lower body

Now that 10 days have passed, I feel that a doctor is not really necessary yet.

That's why I'm asking you for advice on what this could be. Basically I feel 'pain' if I cross-friction these parts:

*  the inner forearm near the middle
*  the outer forearm near the elbow and the wrist

The effect is that I cannot maintain a good grip for long but feel the forearms sore after just a bit.

Is this some kind of tendonitis? Are these muscles? What do you recommend doing

Anyway I lost the two pack

Fast forward to Early March I bought some rings.   Started to do pull ups on rings.

Here are my pics.  I don't think I eat enough.  I really need to eat more.  I mainly eat Chicken, Roast Beef, Fish. I stay away from Fast Food, Chips, Lollies, Soft drinks, Chocolate

I train 3 times a week.

3 X 8-9 L Sit Pull ups (with 10kg in back pack)
3 X 8-9 Dips With feet on bottom (with 10kg in back pack) 
3 X 8 - 9 Pull ups with feet on bottom (with 10 kg in back pack)
3 X 8-9 Push ups with feel elevated on chair

Just started to do diamond pushups. Can only do 5 at the moment.

I'll paraphrase /u/eshlow :

&gt;The best workout you can do is the one you're not doing.

Look at your strengths, as well as my lower back. I see gains, but the real bottle neck of improvement in functional movement (for parkour, calistenics, etc.) is my lack of flexibility.

I've been exclusively strength and flexibility training since October to overcome a serious drop in weight over the summer (165!). My old routine was strictly pushups, planks, bridges, body-weight squats, calf raises. I did each exercise 2 times a week. I used whatever progression I needed to make the sets only 3-8 reps. 

Now that I'm back to my old weight (and stronger than ever!) I want to diversify my routine to include endurance and cardio to round out the routine. I've picked up some weights to give me better options for my legs and lower back. I'm planning on a 4 day split. I'm thinking my new routine should look like this;

Day 1; Planks (Classic, one armed; total 7 planks)

Day 2; Push ups (5x5)

Day 3; Weighted Pistols (5x5)

Day 4; Squats and Pushups circuit. 30 minutes; moderate to intense


I stretch after every workout and before I sleep. I do calf raises every day

My pushups are currently on Archers

My pull ups/dips are lacking

My planks are around 0:45m to 1:30m in length

I recently got to pistols

I'm adding deadlifts because I feel its the only way to properly work my back. Doing them one legged means I can use less weights. I'm planning on starting low and working my way up. 

I feel a pushup/squat circuit will best fit my goals for cardio and endurance

I know pull ups are highly recommended and I do them when I have access to goalposts or something similar but generally

What would you recommend as a replacement? Dips? Handstands?

I'm trying to put together a ""fitness challenge"" for a forum I'm a part of. Kind of like the ""biggest loser"" challenges people do

Scoring will be improvement-based

Unfortunately

So far

* Running (sprint or endurance. Not sure yet)
* Push-ups (maybe burpees instead)
* Pullups
* Plank

My first thought was to come up with a way to score each one that would kind of balance all of them out, pullups, they could focus more on running and still be competitive.

Unfortunately

Now

Any thoughts/suggestions on scoring

Thanks!
