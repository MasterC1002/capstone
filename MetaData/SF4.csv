1315171385.0,k4orj,Alex Valle answers your questions!,Triox,134,22,19,"First off

So without further ado:


---------------------------------------------------------


* **#1 *""As such an experienced player

Some flaws from the new generation of players are lack of fundamentals and simply being competitive. 

Fundamentals is the art of controlling space with your character through movement and attacks. You see many players today just trying to land combos on a skilled player but fail to create opportunities for them. This also goes for players throwing out fireballs at the worst times or always mashing DP when someone is near. Players should research/ask questions about their flaws to whoever they are losing to.

About lack of being competitive, or just turned off from playing on streams and/or going to tournaments. Try not to be discouraged when things get uncomfortable, you'll gain more respect and knowledge every time you get back on the machine.


* **#2 *""Do you support fighting games getting frequent balance changes or do you think that they should be mostly left alone like they were in the past?""* - by Parallel_dinosaur**

Fighting game patches are fine but should be less frequent. Give the game time in the minds of millions and then balance the games out when there's a plateau.


* **#3 *""You have always been very vocal about people supporting local arcades and scenes

Wolfkrone/Latif live many hours away from their offline competition. They've dedicated their time into playing anybody online knowing the hardships it can bring to their game. I would suggest playing local matches online and test out your skills in a tournament nearest you. If things are looking good down the road


* **#4 *""Who are the top 3 underrated characters in AE and why?* - by marinkydink**

Thawk - does well all around vs the cast but moreso vs twins

Sakura - she has great pokes

Cody - he has great zoning tools and very damaging close range pressure. He's not an attractive character to play because of lack of mobility and probably character design,Momochi.


* **#5 *""Do you think this year's unique results (Fuudo

The recent placings in EVO should mildly affect any balance changes imo. The Twins/Fei are the obvious advantageous characters in AE and I believe Capcom knew about this. By now

* **#6 *""As a main figure in the FGC

First and foremost we need all the support we can get from fans that appreciate the game. Support can come from attending events, all you need is a few friends that enjoy the games and want to increase awareness of the good times.


* **#7 *""What is your training schedule?* - by Fenor**

In my youth I practiced 8-10 hour days at the arcade 5-7 days a week. Today


* **#8 *""There's been a trend lately in Capcom fighting games to make them more accessible to the general public, like Ultras and X-factor, and the A-B-C-Launcher formula combos.* **

* ** *Obviously these things can only help casual play by making the games a little easier to play to unexperienced players

Gameplay has evolved from being very basic SF2 form to hardcore ST


* **#9 *""Do you have a plan for your retirement -- do you know what it would take to get you out of the game

I don't plan to retire anytime soon. Retiring in video games sounds silly unless you completely lost interest or change lifestyles which is acceptable. Playing video games with my kids one day is something I look forward to so why stop?


* **#10 *You are one of the greatest projectile users in the FGC - what's going through your mind as you decide WHEN to throw a fireball

* ** *To put it another way

A wise man aka John Choi told me to use FBs like a poke. Treat FBs as an extension of your normal move set. The hardpunch FB is your main poke tool that reaches outside your longest limb such as crouching hardkick. If you know the space where it's safe to throw fbs vs your opponent

First of all

So, so immediately the next day i bought a copy of Super Street Fighter 4 AE off Steam. I was so hyped that I was gonna be playing this amazing game in just 3 hours, I literally didn't do anything, besides finding out how to plug 2 PS3 controllers in my PC, so i just sat there for 3 hours, watching a line slowly move to 100%. When it was done, I was so happy i invited everyone in the house who had interest in playing video games (even though the only two people that were in the house at that moment was my 6-year old brother and 7-year old cousin). And there I was, and looked at the character select screen for 2-3 minutes. Finally i went for the standard pick, it started! I had a quick look at what the controls were, and he continued it too! Somewhere around 15 to 20 losses later i went to practice mode to continue practicing haduokens. My brother also was there and he saw me doing the blue fireball

I really love Street Fighter 4, lol &amp; cs:go) and PSP country here. Its quite rare for someone to have a PS3, also because everyone prefers buying mobile phones &amp; ipads instead. And its even rarer that there are people who have 360's. Those who do are probably playing them modified with pirated games, also for Wii's. If anyone is fortunate enough to play fighting games online, they're playing Tekken.



There's always a great deal of lag when playing online. For every 2 minutes of playtime there's 5-10 minute  of waiting and filtering for a good connection to play with. I main Bison


With regards to arcades, with broken and loose pads most of the time. There's about 1-2 good players I meet every 3 months if everyone is playing at all. If there are any else, they're mostly beginner Ryus/Kens. However, the Tekken arcades are always well-maintained and jam-packed. I do play Tekken too but on a casual manner (I just got the plat on Tag 2 actually).

ok dudes

Rules are as follows:


* Best 2 out of 3 (finals are 3 out of 5)
* Double elimination
* Loser of a match my change character while winner may not (but you MAY change ultra)

The tournament starts tomorrow (April 25th) at 6pm PST. you MUST I repeat **YOU MUST** join the IRC channel [(link here](http://chat.thinstack.net/?nick=&amp;channels=redditfighting)) under the  **NAME YOU SIGNED UP AS**. You will find your opponent and PM them your gamertag and do your matches. 

**You will have 15 minutes to do each of your matches before being DQd**

~~Once you have completed your matches one of you must PM me in the same IRC channel and tell me the outcome so I may record it.~~

**EDIT: It has come to my attention that when you are logged into challonge, have the winner go and record the scores. I will be mentioning this tomorrow before we start as well.**

As much as I would like to get this all done in one day

I will be spectating all the finals matches so they can get uploaded to youtube after this is all done.

I don't really have any number in mind of how many players is enough, anyway.

What I *could* provide in the way of resources:

* Brackets/bracket software
* Leagues (separated by
* Ladders, continent, etc.
* Player registration

What I *could not* provide in the way of resources:

* Streaming - my PC isn't nearly good enough for that
* YouTube match archives

Someone else (looking at you, this would be a great way to simultaneously level up almost the entire /r/SF4 PC community.

Feel free to leave comments/suggestions/constructive criticism or anything along those lines. Make sure to either leave a comment or PM me (if you prefer that

**EDIT:** Thanks for the responses, who's willing to stream, and stuff like that. Registration hasn't technically opened, but if you commented in this thread, I've gone ahead and written your name down ahead of time. To all you streamers who offered to help: I'll most likely be contacting you via PM so we can figure out a schedule that works for you guys.

If anyone's interested

* Weekly tournament
* One special tournament at the end of every month. This will be the one with the flair prizes - thanks soulsynapse!
* North American and EU divisions. Transatlantic connections typically aren't that good
* Ladders - keeping track of who has won what matches/tournaments, and so forth.
* Hopefully both the weekly and the monthly tournament will be streamed. I'm currently trying to work out who will be streaming - I wouldn't be surprised if multiple people streamed at different times of the month.

All of this is up for debate

Remember, so you technically don't have to post again. That said, some of you who posted in this thread don't have your region listed in your flair, so once I make a registration thread, I'll be sending off a PM to everyone who posted here but did not have their region listed.",,False,t5_2r4cj,True

Keits (because of his work with SRK)

Mike Ross (because of his work with Cross Counter)

Gootecks (because of his work with Cross Counter)

James Chen (because of his commentating)

UltraDavid (because of his commentating)



After that I would like to get interesting people like Wolfkrone (cause he's a player who got amazingly good while living in the middle of no where and almost no offline community to play with regularly) or other good SSF4 players.


Anyway, then EVO itself.  Now that it's over, I thought it might be a good time to see about following though with my idea.

**Schedule**

* May 4th
* May 5th

Be sure to be in the #redditfighting IRC channel (located on irc.thinstack.net) 15 minutes or earlier prior to the start of the tournament. There's a link to the web version of chatroom at the top of this subreddit

If this one goes well


**Registration**

***Registration is closed

The current list of registered players is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al_hUmO5kOXFdEQtTUJEak5HVHpfTzROdWV4UjdtVnc&amp;usp=sharing). While it's not possible to register any longer


**Streams**

The stream will be located on [twitch.tv/redditfighting](http://twitch.tv/redditfighting)

For everyone else who offered to stream, feel free to PM me, though I might not be able to respond for a little while.


**Bracket**

* [NA bracket
* [EU bracket

**General info**


The tournament is run in the standard double-elimination format with best 2 out of 3 matches, and grand finals, all of which are best 3 out of 5. Like with most other tournaments, the player to come out of loser's finals must cause a bracket reset by winning one best 3 out of 5 set and then winning another one.

Counterpicking is also similar to most other tournaments - after each individual match in the best 2 out of 3 set

The matches are all run via endless lobbies

Other matches are run in separate 2-man lobbies

After each non-streamed match, the winning player contacts a TO (tournament organizer/operator) who then updates the bracket. For streamed matches, the streamer updates the bracket.

For each match, as soon as any prerequisite matches have finished. 


**Other rules**

* Each player gets 10 minutes to join their respective lobby from the time the invite is sent. Failure to join the lobby inside the 10 minute time period results in an automatic loss. The player can contact a TO to get an additional 5 minutes if need be. This timer starts as soon as the aforementioned IRC notification to that player is sent.
* Each player should be in the #redditfighting IRC channel at least 15 minutes before the start of the first round,False,self,t5_2r4cj,1367588212.0,,mak,t3_1dfy2l

1. **Show up early and get casuals in**. Many of the pros that showed up to the tournament showed up late. I saw Moons, Dieminion, Drewsprite and Chris G. I didn't recognize a few people but I heard they were there like Sanford Kelly. There were some amazing no names that showed up, too. I got to play a TON of casuals beforehand and that's important. Not only is it a good way to warm up but you can talk with your opponent and ask what you're doing wrong and what's going on. I can't stress how important casuals are.

1. **Talk to your peers**. this was my first tourney and EVERYONE was helpful. Everyone wanted to help me out. I met FNEX Madness and he told me that I could ask him anything about Adon! I know have a professional hookup for when I need help with my main! He gave me tips on the spot just because I went up and asked him about his matches. Also, don't be shy and talk to peeps because chances are, they're really nice. 

1. **Don't feel bad if you lose**. I lost real quick but my buddies that I went with talked me through my loss (they were watching) and then I talked to the guy that beat me and asked him what I did wrong. I played Drewsprite first and then Moons afterwards. Got bodied lol. Drewsprite gave me some advice on how to improve my game. It was a great learning experience and I definitely gained from my loss. 

1. **Don't forget to eat/drink.** Very important to stay hydrated. I ended up buying a bottle of water or two. The place was kinda cramped after awhile. Oh and brush your teeth/shower beforehand. Please. 

That's all I got for now. Definitely

1356347451.0,15dcc1,PC modding tips &amp; tricks,poke133,36,4,16,"Hello

Since there have been quite a few offer sales with the game recently I thought i'd share some modding tips that some of you might not be aware of

*****

SIMPLEST INSTALLATION METHOD:

*****

This is a general and very essential tip

The bulk of gameplay files (models/sounds/stages) are located in the **SSF4AE\resource** folder

As long as similar directory and file structure is held

This is a general method of installation for all mods

I hope the following example is clear enough.

Example (with a [custom lifebar](http://augh.deviantart.com/art/SSF4-AE-Retro-health-bars-296273820) modification):

1. Backup the **\patch_1_07** folder (it does contain a few unique files on its own)

2. The mod's readme.txt says we need to install in **\resource\battle\hud\CMN** but we know better!

3. Open the \patch_1_07\ folder and create **\patch_1_07\battle\hud\CMN** directory structure (if it's not already present)

4. Extract the lifebar file **cockpit.tex.emz** to \patch_1_07\battle\hud\CMN

5. Done! \patch_1_07\battle\hud\CMN\cockpit.tex.emz will override the original lifebar \resource\battle\hud\CMN\cockpit.tex.emz

6. When we get tired of this mod or simply don't like it



*****

INTERFACE CHANGES:

*****

* Replacing the Main Menu background because who is really a fan of Ryu kissing Ken?

Here are some great main menu backgrounds: http://augh.deviantart.com/gallery/?q=ssf4+menu

I personally use [this one](http://th03.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2012/106/0/b/ssf4_ae_akuma_menu_by_augh-d4we2l4.jpg)!

* Removing unnecessary intros. I don't like having to skip all those intros and movies.

Simply rename or delete (i recommend renaming) the movie files in these 2 folders:

**SSF4AE\movie\opening**

**SSF4AE\movie\nvidia**

* Replacing lifebars

Here are a couple of custom lifebars (I personally prefer Retro):

http://augh.deviantart.com/art/SSF4-AE-Retro-health-bars-296273820

http://augh.deviantart.com/art/SSF4-AE-Smooth-health-bars-296274410

*****

MUSIC MODS:

*****

* Silencing the Main Menu music (I like to leave the game open

Copy the file **\resource\ui\sound\se\MAIN_SE.csb** to **\patch_1_07\ui\sound\bgm\BGM_MAIN.csb**

* Announcer mod to say ""Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition"" at the title screen (right now it says just ""Super Street Fighter 4""

http://aemods.pbworks.com/w/page/41166311/music#AnnouncermodtosayArcadeEditioncreditJayVasquez77

* Custom music. Sorry

*****

STAGES:

*****

* Replacing Volcanic Rim or other annoying backgrounds with the Bonus stages

http://i.imgur.com/RHMXc.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/t3FG6.jpg

Extensive guide here: http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/ybbr4/pc_bonus_stages_as_regular_stages/

* Aesthetically simplified backgrounds (I use Cloudy Evening At The Old Temple. It removes the distracting pedestrians and adds a moodier cloudy sky: http://i.imgur.com/UUifs.jpg)

http://aemods.pbworks.com/w/page/44880364/Stage%20Mods#SimplifiedStages

* Performance simplified backgrounds (replaces 3D stages with static 2D backgrounds

http://aemods.pbworks.com/w/page/44880364/Stage%20Mods#UltraLightStagePackcreditdoshu

*****

CHARACTER MODS:

*****

I recommend these places for characters mods:

http://aemods.pbworks.com/w/page/41162160/character%20select (collection of mods throught the time

http://shoryuken.com/forum/index.php?threads/ssf4ae-pc-custom-skin-thread.140225/ (discussion between modders

*****

GAMEPLAY MODS:

*****

This is fairly uncharted territory for me since gameplay mods break online compatibility

I can somewhat recommend SF4 Remix (http://www.sf4remix.com/) since I've seen it on a stream with JWong and FLoe. It seemed pretty fun and not extremely wacky. More details on their website.

*****

**TL;DR VERSION**: mods are cool! not convinced? see pics: [1](http://i.imgur.com/RHMXc.jpg), [4](http://i.imgur.com/UUifs.jpg), [5](http://www.sf4remix.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/remixbars5.png), [6](http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/213/a/a/ssf4ae_skin__cammy__killer_bee_by_acethylen-d42c3mf.jpg), [7](http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/203/1/7/ssf4ae_cammy_leona__s_silent_soldier_costume_mod_by_dsforest-d582o4i.jpg), [8](http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/212/a/9/final_fight_streetwise_pack_by_monkeygigabuster-d4280mf.jpg), [9](http://img100.imageshack.us/img100/513/454xf.jpg)

Hi everybody

1. **Redirecting /r/streetfighter.**

    The previous owner handed the subreddit off to us about a week ago

2. **CSS improvements.** (ex: /r/starcraft /r/leagueoflegends /r/music)

    We're looking to update the CSS on the subreddit a bit and we'd like input from everyone on what they would like to see. A good place to start are the subreddits above

3. **Wiki and community projects.**

     We think that the [BnB project](http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/18ur0o/bnb_combos_thread_addendum_fill_in_the_holes/) and the [character specific combo project](http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/1ak8tt/idea_character_specific_combosmixups_thread/) have gotten big enough that they warrant their own pages. If the original creators of the threads feel they're up for the task, FAQs and the like.

We'd also like to hear any other ideas or issues you'd like to see addressed. If you would like to discuss ideas in more detail some of us are available on the [subreddit chatroom](http://chat.thinstack.net/?nick=&amp;channels=redditfighting) as well.

This whole time I've been using my entire arm to move the stick. I just tried relaxing only using my fingers to do inputs after watching that video and it just made a world of difference. Inputs are so much easier now omg.

One thing is that they are still sticking with SF4 and haven't forced us to move onto SF5. Because of this

The next thing to look at is to think of it as preserving the game's player base. By releasing a new edition of Call of Duty each year

I feel that **expansion packs** are better than straight up releasing sequels because you are able to retain your audience; you don't create a situation where half of your players play the older game and the other half plays the newer one. I also see more and more posts about new players getting into SF4 after EVO

(words for new players),Stanger03,31,3,25,"So I've played the game for a while and only got online recently. After many hours in arcade mode I had settled on Juri as my main and could not wait to test my skills online. After about a dozen matches or so

After the numerous disheartening losses, etc. meant, I came back to the game with a new sense of confidence, ready to give out some cans of whoop-ass. Unfortunately the only person getting said cans was me.

So once again I traveled to the magical land of the interwebs to find some more answers on why I sucked. Having done much more research than just character types, and other little tricks for SF4 in general. Once again I felt a new found courage to go online. 

Yeah again I still sucked but the point is, character matchups, and uses for my ultras. The game is infinitely more interesting once you know the specifics of everything instead of playing in a fog of ignorance. I seriously recommend that any new player who is frustrated with how they perform, and don't know exactly why they suck, go look up anything and everything about the characters they play. It helped me stick with the game, learn more, as well as actually enjoy it. 

Now that I (sort of) know what I'm doing I've actually won a few matches. ~300BP with Juri and ~150PP overall. It isn't much

TL;DR I sucked

I am going to talk about life leads since this is something my character

when you have a big life lead

when you have a life lead

A lot of players have a really good understanding of space and frame data so if a situation looks unfamiliar to you - they are jumping up and down or whiffing a certain move repeatedly - be very careful- it could be a trap. sometimes its good to just take the hit and learn exactly HOW they can punish you and from what distances and with what moves. 

when I say you should relax on aggression - that doesn't mean just sitting there holding down back. I find a lot of players will sit there and whiff a command grab or just throw fireballs etc. in order to build super meter. You want to try and keep them from doing this in a SAFE way. 

So what I like to do in this situation is try and SAFELY close space on them and back them into the corner - so walking forward, over and over again, maybe block for 2, walk for .5, block for 10, walk for 2, etc. mix it up so its not too obvious. Try and get a feel for when they like to throw THEIR pokes out too to maximize your walking distance. This is the best chance to use your pokes too - if you can figure out their walking pattern, giving them absolutely no time to throw out a poke of their own and counter. 

Once they are in the corner, and dash back - three less options to worry about! A lot of thier moves might be unsafe now because you are effectively controlling the entire space. Now the ball is in their court to make a move and they are going to be tempted into doing something unsafe that you can punish and hopefully close out the round. 

If it is the last round and I am massively ahead

One issue you will run into is people using shoryukens etc and cancelling them with full bar

If the life meters are starting to even out again

The game revolves around opportunities - think about the speed of your character, the moves they have, these attributes allow for more or less opportunities. You need to think about how your character fits into this model and play accordingly in order to utilize those opportunities the best way you can.

My name is Guy Connor Lester, and am also a competitive Magic: the Gathering player... but I wanted to get into this game in a big way after watching Evo 2k13. (Yes, part of the baby boom that it created.)

I just kind of wanted to write down my thoughts on being a new player in a competitive light

After following SF a bit pre-Evo (the hype was getting to me), I couldn't help but feel like I wanted to be a part of this. So, I dusted off my PS3 version of AE, bought it on Steam (sale was going on!), and broke into it. 

I built a custom stick using the shell of a MCZ TE SC5, so a stick has always felt better than a controller regardless). With the advice of this Subreddit, I started with Ryu, and went straight into training. 

After hours (that turned into days) practicing small combo's (such as cr. forward into fireball) and focusing on fundamentals

I've always been the kind of person to ignore tier lists, and head. I just wait until something clicks, and then I just know.

Well, mMm!), I was always eager to get home, get into the training room, and try new things with Oni.

At first, I jumped back into training mode for another few days to level up some more.

As time progressed, and react to it.

I started winning. Not a lot, just playing with the basic fundamentals, and punishing with BnB's, and not actually dropping them every time... I felt like I leveled up. Such an amazing feeling.

Before I knew it, to reach 1000 PP / BP. Now, I know, BP/PP doesn't really mean much, nor does beating your opponent necessarily, it's all about your execution and practice so that you can beat the guy sitting next to you at your next tournament. 

However

Thanks all for reading

PS. 
Might as well do some shameless self promoting while i'm here. I'm starting a 'Road to Evo 2k14' as kind of a personal goal and have started Streaming my play often. If you ever feel like watching some SF, I'd really appreciate it. My twitch is [HERE] (http://twitch.tv/RidillSF). I tweet when I'm going live @CelShaded.

1345113526.0,ybbr4,[PC] Bonus stages as regular stages,poke133,28,3,13,"you can replace the Training stage with one of the bonus stages (modified so as to not contain the car or barrels that would interfer with gameplay). the stages are compatible with online play

installation notes: extract the .rar in ""SSF4AE\resource\battle\stage""

you can also replace any other stage with them

example to replace Volcanic Rim:

1. extract one of the two modified bonus stages somewhere

2. open the 2 stage files (STG_TRN.tex.emz &amp; STG_TRN.emz) in a HEX editor

3. search &amp; replace TRN with VCN (match case)

4. rename STG_TRN.tex.emz &amp; STG_TRN.emz into STG_VCN.tex.emz &amp; STG_VCN.emz

5. copy these renamed files to ""SSF4AE\resource\battle\stage"" (make sure you made a backup first)


i replaced Volcanic Rim (VCN) and Diner At Night (USA) (which i personally dislike) with the Bonus Barrel and Bonus Gas gas stage respectively. now i'm a lot less annoyed with stage Random Select :D",self,t5_2r4cj,1345113840.0,,bipson,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/ybbr4/pc_bonus_stages_as_regular_stages/

So

There was no tournament

Some of my impressions/things I noticed:

* Raven had/has no dash in this build. Don't know if that was a bug or wanted since he has pretty godlike dash moves that let your opponent guess if it's going to be a cross up or not. Probably best compared to Oni in AE.

* Yun fans can rejoice: Julia has the f.HP, Lunge punch, she felt just like Yun except for the missing divekick (but still with a good j.HK that combos).

* Hugo is a beast. Probably due to our knowledge in 3S we figured him out the most that day. He has crazy wallbounce air grab combos that do tons of damage.

* Dhalsim has a fucking fast jump but alas his limbs are not chainable ala Alpha.

* The Tekken players that were at the event found crazy ground bounce combos with Steve and Hwoarang that dealt massive damage. I think that Tekken Bnbs probably work in this game. Not sure how else they found out so fast. :D

* Kuma seemed pretty weak at first. His dash went only a really short distance and he seemed free against everybody who can zone.  Then we found out that he heavily relies on his roll move

* Talk about dashes: the Tekken characters who had good dashes could cancel their dashes into ... dashes. Wave dashing without the crouching! This combined with complete fireball invulnerability made them pretty godlike against fireball characters. I already heard that capcom is aware of this and is going to nerf them though.

* Raven has ground and air projectiles!

* The cross assault (the special where you play both of your characters at once) will in my opinion become what makes this game fucking fantastic. At the end of the day me and a few of my buddies already did some crazy shit that just bounced the opponent back and forth nonstop.

* Marduk has potential but it has yet to be unlocked I guess. :P

* Ken and Kazuya are best friends. To me they felt like the most complete team that day.

* Meter building off whiffed moves was random in this build. Some characters like Hugo had no meter building off whiffed moves and others like I think Yoshimitsu and Raven had seemingly random amounts of meter built through whiffed moves (Seth pointed out though that this is just a glitch in the current build as far as I heard).


All in all it was a freaking awesome event and I really like the game now even though I didn't like it before I played it. Seth Killian

So far with about 6 hours of XBL I managed 2k pp 3k BP with Evil Ryu on a fresh account ( Satsui No Ryu ), it's just a mix of a few things that's been killing me, mostly match up knowledge basically I need more and they know what Evil Ryu does XD.

Sad news is the luggage Handlers are rough on the trip here and my recorder got destroyed :( no stream no youtube videos.

On a slightly strange and funny note, more surprisingly you'll  see that same roster of top players often losing games to said salary men.

That being said

I got the game less than 72 hours ago and I've spent at least 20 of them reading and watching youtube videos. I really want to get better but I can't seem to find out how to start identifying what I'm bad at and where my mistakes are. (there are just so damn many) Obviously I'm not winning many online matches. The few I am winning are with hakan. Not sure if he is just rare enough that people don't know how to fight against his moves or if I'm actually getting proficient with him.

Again

I don't know the correct course of action right now. As of right now I'm trying to find a few characters to spend my time on. I'm hoping by narrowing down the field of moves to master I can get better more quickly and learn the nuances of each moveset both offensively and defensively. But with the vast breath and depth of the game I don't feel like I even know what questions I should ask so I can get better.
