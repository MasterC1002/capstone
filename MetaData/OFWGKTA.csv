1364623239.0,1bagse,The Story Behind Tyler &amp; His Albums,theelderscrolls,547,62,111,"     In ""Bastard"", The Creator, he can't take all the sadness his father has brought him and from being a bastard



     In the beginning of Goblin, which is a reference to Tyler wanting to kill himself because he was a bastard at the end of Inglorious, he says ""bang"" wanting to pull the trigger. Or this might be a reference to Lone, the last song on Wolf, When Dr. TC asks if anyone's seen 'Sam' lately, and at the end Tyler/Wolf says ""If I see that nigga, imma kill him"". At the end of Goblin track, how was your trip to new york?"" The next track is titled ""Yonkers""



     The beginning of the track starts with ""Wolf Haley/Golf Wang"". Golf Wang is Wolf Gang if you switch the ""G"" and ""W"". Golf Wang, Tyler tries to battle his evil white alter ego Wolf Haley (Tyler wanted his nickname to be Wolf, and wanted to change his last name to Haley cause his father left him and he didn't want his last name) by rapping back and forth with himself. ""I'm a fucking walking paradox"" says Tyler, and then Wolf jumps in saying ""No I'm not"", contradicting what Tyler just said. Tyler hates Wolf, and wants to get rid of him, but he knows Wolf is so cool and a good rapper, because Wolf is a crazy awesome dude with red hair, then Tyler says ""Fuck money, in the video



     At the end of the song Nightmare, and Tyler responds ""Tron Cat"". Dr. TC=Tron Cat=Tyler's Conscience. In the track ""Bitch Suck Dick"", Tyler kills Taco and Jasper at the end, for no apparent reason. Then, at the beginning of the next track, ""Window"" Dr. TC tells Tyler""I brought your friends here to come talk to you/I couldn't get a hold of Jasper and Taco for some reason"". Because Tyler killed them in ""Bitch Suck Dick"". In the end of the track ""Window"", Tyler gets a gun and kills Mike G, saying ""nigga what the fuck are you doin'?/You just gonna...nigga hold on, nigga sorry."" The gun drops, give me the gun."" and Tyler still repeats



     The next track, and gold's atomic number is 79, ergo, Au79, the track's title. The next, and last track on Goblin, called ""Golden"" (referencing to the track before this one, you obviously have some fuckin problems"", dark album that it was supposed to be. Dr. TC says afterwards, tomorrow (Goblin) and The next day (Wolf)."" Later on in the song



     Now, the track ""Wolf"" starts with Sam singing and playing on the piano.  Dr. TC, the camps counselor, comes in saying ""Music sounds good, Sam, you've been practicing."" and introduces Sam to Wolf. Dr. TC says ""Sam and his band  have been at Camp Flog Gnaw for a while"" and then he leaves to fill out field trip slips. Wolf, trying to be casually friendly, and Sam responds with ""look, capisce?"" The next track, Hodgy says ""Here comes that weak ass nigga Samuel."" The next song



     The next track, and at the end of the song, when Sam gets back from a drug deal, he asks where Salem is. A friend of his replies they are ""by the lake"" and Sam becomes angry and mutters to himself ""what the fuck?"". The next track, IFHY (I Fucking Hate You) is about Sam confronting Salem about hanging out with Wolf. Sam is jealous that Salem likes Wolf, and he doesn't want that to happen. The track ends with Wolf and Salem talking. Wolf asks Salem why he's a dick, Salem tells him that some shit happened back home and he ran away, ""what happened?"" The next song, which is why he's at Camp Flog Gnaw. The next song, ""not if I get to him first."" In the next track



     The next track, he heard about some fights and stuff, and he wants to know what happened. Wolf starts rapping, and ends on the subject of his grandma dying. Dr. TC apologizes for his loss, and tells Wolf ""Last time I seen Sammy, he was looking for you."" Wolf replies, ""Fuck that nigga Sammy."" Puzzled, ""nah



     Now, Tyler talks to Dr. TC about him hating his dad, and contemplates suicide in the end, but he gets over it. Then, Wolf is sent to Camp Flog Gnaw as a kind of vacation from what happened in Bastard. In Wolf, Wolf describes his troubles with Sam, because he is flirting with Sam's girlfriend. At the end, I would kill him"" and if the first track of Goblin is played afterwards, it fits perfectly. And because Earl died in Rusty, that wouldn't leave any fun for him. And then at the end of Goblin

1364399731.0,1b4660,Track By Track Story of Wolf,Naquanrice,300,26,154,"So i'm on my second listen and I think I have the story down.

Wolf - Intro to the album. Sam is playing the piano as Dr. TC walks in and complements him on his playing. He introduces Sam to Tyler and vice versa. As Dr. TC walks out he says he has to finish filling out field trip slips. Tyler tries to be friends with Sam but Sam isn't having any of that.

Jamba - Jamba means Fart in Swahili

Cowboy - I'm assuming this is a Sam song. He talks about Salem and Slater who must be people already at Flog Gnaw. I think the title Cowboy means that he rides alone. It's only him. At the end Tyler meets Salem.

Awkward - I think this song could be about Sam and Salem meeting and falling in love. The distorted voice could mean that it is Sam talking. The singing at the end saying

Domo23 - No meaning to the title,"" could mean he just wants to do this for fun and doesn't care about getting money from it yet they still give it to him.

Answer - A make believe conversation between Tyler and his dad in the beginning of the song. He talks about how his father not being there started his rapping career and he thinks of Clancy as a father figure. He never really calls his dad from the last line of the verse, I hope you answer."" The second verse starts and he's telling the problems he and his friends are having. He drops a hint that his grandma by saying she's just nostalgic meaning she's just in the past, something he remembers. So when he calls her she won't answer. Third verse comes and he's talking about a girl (maybe Salem). 

Slater/ Escape-ism - A Sam song (maybe). Talking about what kind of person he is. He's disrespectful to women and doesn't give a fuck. Sam is an angry person. Oh and Slater is a bike not a person. Sam likes to play jazz. At the end with Frank

48 - Nas excerpt, he's in 48 out of 50 states. He runs the coke game. Mr. Treat Your Nose runs the country. Sam says he's sorry for what he's done to people's lives and dreams. He's in way too deep and he's scared to death. Nas is explaining how Sam feels.

Colossus/ The Bridge of Love - Tyler song. About how people dick ride him while he's trying to have fun at Six Flags. A guy comes up to him and explains his love for him. This guy worships Tyler and is going crazy. Tyler is telling him it's weird how much affection this guy has for him

Partyisntover/ Campfire/ Bimmer - Partyisntover first. I think Tyler is hitting on Salem in this song,"" talking about Sam. Tyler wants to take Salem away from Sam. He knows Salem is unhappy with Sam. Sam finds out that Salem and Tyler (Wolf) are together now.

IFHY - First off this Pharell feature is awesome. Now, Salem tells him he's not the guy he portrays to be and came to Camp Flog Gnaw because he ran away from home after what happened there.

Pigs - Sam song. This is about Sam's life before running away. Sam is bullied and hated by everybody and is lonely. Sam is talking about revenge and getting back at everybody. He wants to take over his town. Sam kills a little kid and killed his step father. He talks about killing all of his classmates and the girl that said no to him when he asked her to prom. There are four Sam's

Parking Lot - Sam song again. The first verse talks about him raping a girl basically. Sam talks about how he's the shit again. His group is the Loiter Squad and they're getting together to get Tyler. Somebody warns Tyler that Sam is looking for him to kill him.

Rusty- Not sure what the voice mail means at the beginning of the song. Tyler gets Domo and Earl together to help him fight Sam. I think they are just meeting that's why they are sort of introducing themselves (how they just talk about themselves) to each other. Sam comes in at the end of the song and shoots Earl.

Trashwang - Lee Spielman going crazy on this. The fight song? I think it represents Tyler's group and Sam's group mixing. Or

Treehome95 - A song that Salem (Coco O.) wrote. I'm not sure who Erykah Badu represents though. I'm not even sure who Salem is singing this song to in the first place

Tamale - TAMALE TAMALE TAMALE TAMALE TAMALE TAMALE TAMALEEEEEEEE. A Tyler song I believe. I think this song is talking about Tyler acting up at camp (possibly after Salem went back to Sam). He gets caught jerking off and is taken to the office

Lone/ Jornada - Jornada means Day in spanish. Tyler is talking to Dr. TC in this song. Not sure why it's called day but Tyler is talking about the problems he's having to Dr. TC. At the end TC asks Tyler about Sam to which Tyler replies

Bastard was the song; that 30 second video clip of Tyler playing those dreary piano chords

I was scared to love it

I slowly emerged myself into the world of BASTARD, drugs, rape, satanism, and the sincerity behind it all was an unsettling combination.  But, as I listened closer I realized that it was metaphorical and went much deeper than that.  It was real music and emotion coming from kids that hated the way things were. And they did it all on their own.  They were sad, a little crazy, I could actually relate to the music because it was about emotions that I felt in my daily life; not the bullshit from every other artist about women I’ll never get and money I’ll never have. 

These kids were trashy, controversial, and fucking crazy.. everything that I had inside of me that I hid from everyone my whole life, including myself.  I began to explore these thoughts, beliefs, and doubts I held inside about religion, society, and life.. I fucking loved it and I haven’t looked back since. Its been a long journey trying to find myself and have been constantly evolving.  I began to immerse myself into things I enjoyed that others may look down upon. I started to do things that others didn’t necessarily approve of and were judgmental about. I became more outgoing, loving

I lost my belief in stupid shit like fake green paper and the judgement of others and I started caring about myself.  I realized that corruption runs the world and greediness is the only way to get ahead.  I learned that people are not evil because of a lack of god; it was a lack of empathy. And those people are just wired in a different way and it might not necessarily be their fault. I realized that I can do whatever I want, so we make up the answers in our heads as a defense mechanism. I am nothing but stardust and consciousness, and I will do what I please within the confines of this awful society of humans that believe they are much bigger than they really are.

Today, 3 days before my graduation from college. Those same kids that originally set me on this path to personal freedom have grown up, much like I have, and were basically there fucking cheer me on into the next phase of my life.  

I’m planning to move somewhere big; maybe Seattle.  I’m going to learn the piano.  I’m going to understand computers better than I thought would be possible.  I’m going to take singing lessons.  I’m going to write rap, but who the fuck cares; I’m doing it for myself, not for anyone else..  I’m going to travel and indulge in everything I want to. I’m going to do things with my life that I had always scared myself away from because I was afraid of what people would think. Hell, I'm even posting to Reddit for the first time (aside from the occasional drunken and now erased comments) even though I'm extremely nervous about it. And I’m going to continue to face these fears head-on and turn my life into a great experience.  I’m excited for the possibilities.  I’m really fucking excited.

And I give a lot of credit to Odd Future for this new-found and strange attitude I’ve taken on.  They’re influence has given me all the courage I needed to change myself.  With out that change, not only did Tyler and Earl help save my life, they helped me start it.

""Do you want to know why this is the best music video that will be released this year? I'll tell you.
Odd Future has never been more self-aware then right now. In the beginning all you see is Earl, Golf Wang, just Earl. He begins doing his own thing, but just as he's getting warmed up the camera pans to the more generic members. All dressed in Supreme, Tyler rapping about Golf Wang. Through most of the video you see Earl doing his own thing and then everyone else coming up and stealing his thunder. We se Earl chilling not giving a fuck in the pit with everyone else doing a bunch of edgy 2OFWGKTA4u bullshit around him. But Earl doesn't care, he knows in the end, he's the center of the group. Its the critics raving about Earl that keeps Odd Future going. Then you see Earl pushing Tyler in the cart. You want to know what that cart represented? You guessed it. The OF bandwagon,,False,t3_1a5t29

Since Doris is so anticipated the snippet quickly spread. Being posted to numerous other forums

A rumor spread over the internet that Earl had said at one of the shows ""GET READY FOR MAY 9TH"" However

This is where HonkeyGolfGoat comes in. He uses the rumor of May 9th. Is one of the first to Upload the snippet to YouTube. Even using some tech shit to change his location of his tweets to Spokane

Many thought he was Earl. He was and is not Earl.

May 9th came and he dropped nothing. Many of you still beilieved him even after he claimed to have sent the album to Anthony Fantano. A beloved /mu/ reviewer

He than posted a claimed snippet of a song called Jackal. Which was really just an edited version of this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1o3_OwqhP8 with a skit from South Park over it.

Despite earl tweeting this: 
https://twitter.com/earlxsweat/status/332695288076701698

Earl: jackal is not a song like idk where the fuck u niggas are getting that from. jackal is what i call girls that are from hell

Many of you still believed HonkeyGolfCoat. Hell

I knew 100% he was a troll when he tried to bring me into the mix by using me as a scapegoat.


http://i.imgur.com/QrQzarD.png

He shortly deleted that after tweeting it.

Only 1 known person outside OF has Doris tracks





***TL;DR: HONKEYGOLFCOAT IS JUST A TROLL. ONLY A KTT USER HAS DORIS HOWEVER HE DELETED THE ORIGINAL THREAD WHERE HE POSTED THE 150 MOLASSES SNIPPET. HE ALSO CLAIMS TO HAVE ANOTHER TRACK CALLED FEET. ALSO STOP BEING SO FUCKING GULLIBLE JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE CAN UPLOAD A SNIPPET DOESNT MEAN THEY HAVE DORIS ***

IT COULD easily not be part of it

At the end of Goblin, Camp Flog Gnaw, which is this perfect place with pretty girls and a beautiful lake, and all of his friends are there too. He chooses to be the altar ego he is most familiar with, Wolf Haley. Now, because this is all in his mind, it explains the presence of Dr. TC
The fact that it's still technically Tyler the whole album explains why songs like Awkward and Colossus show up. 
Now, and we all know how much he loves bicycles. Salem could represent one or all of the many girls who stole and broke his heart. Sam could sort of be a combination of all the people he hates, with his shitty unwelcoming attitude. If there's one thing Tyler hates, it's people who steal girls from him, and that's exactly what Sam is doing.

The song [Earl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78_loMbmKJ8) was released, Odd Future had begun to catch the spotlight. Earl's flow and delivery captured people wanting to hear more lyricism from Odd Future. The song is rife with the clever wordplay of Earl. The artist himself has said ""Earl [is] the track [he] will never be able to surpass.""   
   
Earl begins with an introduction to his demeanor, suck it up;/ but hurry, I got nuts to bust and butts to fuck and ups to shut and sluts to fuckin' uppercut."" display Earl's penchant for multi-syllable rhymes. The song also shows the brevity of the majority of Earl's songs. The song clocks in at 2:31 and only two verses, the second being only 8 bars long. This is a oft-used argument against Earl. The argument says his songs are much too short to be considered feats of lyricism, but Earl's wordplay packs many lines into those short verses. While the first verse was an introduction to Earl, the second was a diatribe towards the music blog, 2dopeboys with whom the group have a hate-filled relationship. Earl describes how the bloggers are soft and Earl also threatens to harm them.

* Hodgy is the worst actual rapper in OFWGKTA. His lyrics are not very good and I can barely handle his voice at times.

* Up until Chum, etc.) Oldie and Home were good, however.

* Numbers was god awful.

* Most of the OF merchandise looks awful

What are some of yours?

EDIT: Also

EDIT2: Got some more things I thought of.

* The Internet is the best sub-group in OF

* Besides Earl

* Did I mention how underrated/overlooked JAOT and Internet are? Nobody ever talks about them in this subreddit. The only things that get upvotes are Frank, of the OF fanbase.

***

**I AM NOT SAYING THE ALBUM IS GONNA SUCK

If you haven't noticed

***

* **NO ALBUM COVER**

Now this should be one of the easiest ways to promote album, but you really can't reveal your cover art? 

* **VIDEOS/SINGLES**
 
If you're going to release your first single, that's somewhat good. ""Chum"" did a decent job at this. However, it took over five months for Earl to release the next single, that's almost half a year. And by the time you have a second single, you should reveal the release date or have had one set by now. ""Whoa"" did not do this. It was just another Earl video I guess. Then, ""Guild"" came out. It kind of came out of nowhere with little to no promotion and it didn't hurt that the song sucked and was not up to the quality Earl set with ""Whoa"" and ""Chum."" It sounded like something someone would just upload for the hell of it, just because they made it or they would want to put it on a mixtape. Problem is is that Doris supposed to be a major label (slightly) debut. Earl has not been consistent in releasing singles/videos.

* **LIVE PERFORMANCES**

Earl has performed at least 4 or 5 (if you're counting 20 Wave Caps) songs of Doris and if you count that with all the songs released (Chum, he's already shown 8 of the songs on the album. It's rumored that there is supposed be 13 tracks on the album. I haven't checked out most of the live performances but knowing that is bad. With everyone having iPhones and shit, its pretty easy for someone to record that new song thats going on your album, multiple times. Now it's okay to  perform some songs live, but if your album is 13 tracks, you don't need to release that many singles or perform that many songs live.

* **RELEASE DATES**

There have been a few rumored release times for Doris, it didn't. And now we've heard it will come out in late July. Earl, it's okay to push back an album release date if it means the album will have better quality, but, for you there is no album release date to push back, just a timeframe. If it's coming out in late July, just have a goddamn release date if you're finished with the album.

***

Those are some of the things I can contribute to the album promotion being terrible. When you try to promote an album, anything along those lines, but with Doris, the promotion of the album has turned me away from buying it and all I really want is for the album to leak, just so we can listen and end this abysmal promotion of an album. Hopefully you take some steps from Tyler and other artists with the promotion of Gnossos and not fuck it up.

Hey guys, fun, and not stupid.

* Don't just post comments that are straight hate to OF and/or Clancy

* Don't post inappropriate comments about Kelly or Chloe

* No stupid jokes like the ""horse sized duck/duck sized horses"" question. It's okay to post jokes

* Don't plug your own shit to Clancy.

* Don't ask dumb questions like ""who's your favorite member?"" and such.

* Do not ask if OF is going to come to your city. 

* Like the first two guidelines

If you guys think there should be more guidelines,False,,t5_2sa6t,1374274872.0,,YungLean,t3_1i6ju7
