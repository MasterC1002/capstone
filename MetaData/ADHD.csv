***

Ari has generously accepted my offer to be the guinea pig for the 1st **/r/ADHD expert AMA**. /r/ADHD is a great place to find tips/information from others with ADHD and now it is a place to interact with ADHD experts as well!

Ari is the author of:

* One of my favorite ADHD books **[More Attention Less Deficit](http://www.amazon.com/More-Attention-Less-Deficit-Strategies/dp/1886941742)** (has perforated corners and &lt;1 page on each topic).

He has been active in the ADHD community for the past 13 years as a **clinical psychlogist, and author.**

***

What topics does Ari know about?

* ADHD and Relationships 
* anxiety

I recommend listening to his podcasts (most under 10 minutes!) and reading his blog at [adultadhdbook.com](http://www.adultadhdbook.com). 

###### Listen to the webinar I did with Ari on the topic [A Stronger Mindset to Overcome Life's Challenges](http://www.addresources.org/files/ari-tuckman-webinar-a-stronger-mindset-to-overcome-lifes-challenges.mp3) (52 mins). You can get a sense for his clear style filled with lots of examples. 

*Note: This was my first webinar so I didn't record the first couple minutes the audio starts mid-sentence. 

##### Thank you /r/ADHD and Ari for making this AMA a success (in advance)!

 Last night I read /u/TheBananaKing description of ADHD in /r/bestof. When I was finished I was so pissed I slammed my laptop closed

NEVER IN MY LIFE has anyone been in my head like that not a shrink or doctor

I was diagnosed with ADD before most anyone knew it existed. I was 9

 Eight years ago I got married to the woman of my dreams and I discovered to my horror that ADD and ADHD were myths

And I believed her. 

I started thinking I was inadequate, more efficiently, more... like her. She believed my struggle was a ruse to manipulate and control her, make her pay the bills, clean the house, make phone calls, plan meals and events, maximum effort minimal result. 

In 2011 she divorced me for being ""emotionally abusive"" my world collapsed

After reading that post and getting slapped with the biggest reality check ever *I had lost my marriage/life to ADD* all the subsequent comments with other people sharing their behaviors and coping mechanisms continued to punch me in the face. THIS IS REAL. (I had forgotten)

You will always find people that sympathize with you they say oh yah sometimes it's hard for me to focus too. Others who share side effects of medications with you or a funny story about their random thought process that started with a Beagle and ended up in a yo-yo factory.

But I have NEVER had someone get in the drivers seat of my brain and so perfectly describe what it's like to be me. I have never felt so validated in my life.

Last year my brother in IT showed me Reddit to find motivational stuff and distractions from the depression of losing my wife. I said to him ""you realize you just threw me down a rabbit hole I will probably never escape from"" I never imagined it would literally change my life. Yesterday I found motivation

**Tips for dealing with Hyperactivity**

_________

For a lot of people with ADHD

* When you are in one of those situations where you have to sit still and you feel physically like you can't still any longer, as it has a similar effect.

* Keep a small lump of no-dry clay, or really anything that works for you with you at all times. Fidgeting has been proven to help with all forms of ADHD (both Attention and Hyperactivity) as it keeps your brain awake and lets you spend less time worrying about what your body parts are doing (happens to me all the time with my hyperactivity) and more time focusing. [Here is an article on the benefits of exercising.](http://phys.org/news162554898.html)

* Make sure to do some form of exercising every single day, right after you wake up. This will get some of your excess energy out before work/school as well as provide stimulation. You can also work out before bed and this may make it easier for you to sleep at night. [Here is an article on the benefits of exercise for ADHD](http://www.everydayhealth.com/health-report/adult-adhd/treatment.aspx)

Supposedly exercise brings ADHD's faulty receptors up to the normal levels for around two hours after the workout.

If you are in a work atmosphere where this is an opportunity, step outside for some fresh air. This is especially easy if you work at home. If you work in a cubicle, even just standing for a minute and stretching can help.

**Tips for dealing with Impulsivity**

__________

The main symptoms of Impulsivity are doing things without thinking

* Before you act, but eventually you will develop the skills to stop and think before acting.

Before you just blurt something out, and you will not gain results unless you work hard at it. It will be a pain, but you will see results. Think of conversations as time to practice. When you are chatting with your parents or friends, think about everything you even consider saying. Trust me, practice makes perfect.

**Inattentiveness**

_________

As one of the biggest issues related to ADHD

*Memory:* 

Memory is a huge part of inattentiveness

* Loose objects like keys, etc... are commonly lost by us ADHDers. How to stop losing these essential objects you ask? Bowls. That is it. Bowls. Keep a bowl right inside the door of your house to toss you keys and wallet into. Put a bowl in your room/kitchen/living room and be sure to put your phone into the bowl of whatever room you are in. Keep a bowl in your office and put all of your stuff into the bowl when you get there.

* Do a quick mental checklist before leaving any location. ""Wallet, check, check.  Good to go.""

* Notebooks. Notebooks are my everything. Actually, and it is best to have everything in one place. Put in to-do lists, schedules, reminders, future events... Your notebook is your best friend. Write everything down. Everything. If you need to remember something write it in the notebook.

* Reminders.  On most phones there is a reminder system (or at least on IPhones and SmartPhones).  I set reminders to myself to do almost everything.  I duplicate my notebook to-do list on my phone just in case I lose my notebook.  Also

* Sticky notes. Sticky notes are great reminders. Put a sticky note on your front door saying :

                      Do you have your:

                      Wallet

                      Phone

                      Car keys

                      etc...

Put the same thing on the door to your office/workplace to make sure you remember it all. Basically

*Motivation*

I'm not gonna lie to you, I probably won't do it. It is time to fix that.

Come up with a reward system. For example

Schedule a specific time to do it. Are you gonna do it if it is just sitting on your to-do list? Hell no. If you have a specific set time

Feel free to check out /r/motivation for quotes and such for you to get off your butt and do what you've gotta do.

*Inattentiveness*

* Go into a dark room and eliminate all sources of light. Take a flashlight in with you, rapidly moving it around. try to keep your eyes on the beam. In the dark room there is nothing to look at, so you will automatically want to focus on the light. It is a good brain training exercise.

* Try to work in 20 minute intervals. I have found this incredibly beneficial

^ 9:00-9:20 = Math homework

^ 9:20-9:40 = organize file cabinet

^ 9:40-10:00 = break

^ 10:00-10:20 = History homework

^ 10:20-10:40 = Math Homework

^ 10:40-11:00 = Organize file cabinet

^ 11:00-11:20 = Break

^ 11:20-11:40 = English homework.

If I finish something during that time slot then I can open up all of the time slots I had scheduled for it later on to do what I want. If I don't finish something in the number of slots I had set up for it

________

**Sleep**

__________

*Sleeping starts with waking up*

I know the feeling. Your alarm bell rings at 7 o'clock, NO. If you decide to sleep in (and as a lazy college student that's a really easy decision to make) you won't be able to fall asleep the following evening. If I wake up tired, that means I have a slightly better chance of falling asleep without a struggle the following night.

Also, with loud and obnoxious tones.  I have to get up to turn them off!

*Food*

Make sure you eat enough during the day.  Eat well during the day to ease the comedown of your meds in the evening and to give you the energy to make it through the day.

Try to eat a lot of fruit and veggies. Even though vitamin C makes your urine acidic and causes meds like dexamphetamine and adderall to be flushed out of your system quicker

Don't drink caffeine

Don't eat a lot of sugary goodness after dinner either

*Exercise*

Make yourself tired.  Especially when you do a desk job or anything else that requires you to be inside a lot

*Lights*

Like I said above

Switch your tv and computer off 2 hours before bedtime, if you have to use your computer install f.lux and dim the screen.

If you don't mind looking dorky

*Going to bed*

Go to bed when you are tired. Make sure your bedroom is full of fresh air, get up and read a book in a really uncomfortable chair until you get sleepy again.

If you are sleepy and can't fall asleep (like I have all the time) don't get mad or frustrated. You are lying in bed, get up and read a book or something. I love painting, so I get out of my bed and paint.

It's important to keep your bedroom for sleeping and having sex only. Don't watch tv

( **[Original Post with slightly more info if you are interested](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/170mor/having_trouble_sleeping_i_wrote_a_guide_for/)** )

________

**Medication**

_________

* Take a 2-5 day break from your meds every few weeks. If you can find a short span of days where you know you won't need to be on medication

* Take your medicine with or after eating breakfast

* Eat dinner after your medication has worn off

* Don't eat or drink citrus as it makes your meds wear off sooner.

* **CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU ARE HAVING WEIRD SIDE EFFECTS.  They are the experts

___________

**DIET**

__________

SUPER UBER DUBER IMPORTANT.  Way more important than most people give it credit for.

* Minimize sugar and carbohydrates.  They increase hyperactivity and inattentiveness

* Eat lots of protein and start taking Omega-3s.  They have shown to improve focus.  Plus

* As always, fruits, and meat with every meal.  Except breakfast.  If you don't wanna then don't eat veggies with breakfast ;)

__________

**Other Tips**

__________

* Learn to meditate.  There are lots of different ways

* Talk to psychiatrist and/or get an ADHD Coach.  ADHD coaches and psychiatrists can help you through the tough times and get your life together.

* Take a day to write out all of your symptoms

* Try to keep your environment clean.  Nothing exacerbates ADHD like a messy environment.  Which is ironic because it is very hard for ADHDers to *get* organized...

* Don't tell your workplace about your condition unless you absolutely need to!

* When doin chores it is much easier to turn on a  movie or call a friend than to do it in silence and hatred!

1357615202.0,165thy,I went to my first ADHD coaching session today. Here are some tips that I got that have never occurred to me. ,zenskysix,314,37,115,"- If your SO wants you to pay attention to them

- Go on walks with your SO when you need to discuss something.

- If you have chores to do when you get home don't sit down. Once you sit down it is game over.

- Again with chores

- Don't feel guilty about working on things you enjoy first. The motivation of completing one task will make the mundane ones easier.

- Stay busy and try to figure out something healthy and productive that stimulants your mind.

- Consider a standing desk. It's much easier for someone with ADHD to concentrate while standing rather than sitting.

Hope some of these are helpful for you. I highly recommend seeking out an ADHD coach; it's going to be expensive but I think it's going to be immensely helpful to work with someone who specializes with ADHD mind.

Do you ever have to do something boring? Maybe you don't like it but it's pretty mindless and easy. You get it done because that's your job. What if I told you, or maybe everything comes to mind. You start to get frustrated. You need to get this work done, it's important and you have to do it. Hours have gone by, and you still haven't done it.

Maybe it works a little, and a little is better than nothing. Now you've spent the whole day playing games, browsing the internet, getting distracted. Maybe you've worked for an hour, at best.

Every day, is a struggle. It's a constant, wearying fight. Some days you win, some days you lose. You've got pills to help you. Some days they work pretty well. Some days you might as well have thrown them in the trash.

Every week, I just *wouldn't do it*. There was no good reason. I just simply didn't respond to the input and went back to whatever I was doing.

This week, I actually did the thing I had scheduled for myself. It was easy. I just picked up the phone and called, something I hadn't done in a very long time. My mom was so happy to hear from me.

You're trying so hard to summon the resolve to start...

Yo

Nah

What a great episode. Good shit. Oh - whatever happened to those gummies? Wtf? You ate them? When? Whatever. No problem. Except

Lets see what's in the fridge. Wait. Check the cupboards first. Might have some snacks. No dice? It's cool

.

What? There's popcorn? *Fuck yeah!! Fukken saved.* 

.

You can't just eat popcorn though. You just got out of a tight spot. Gotta celebrate. You should watch that one episode while you eat. Nah hold up. Been a while since you've checked that one site. No, what's that smell? *Fuck yeah! Popcorn's done!*

.

Oh god. Oh fuck. It's been 5 hours. You've done no work. It's getting dark outside. *Fuck*. What the fuck? Why are you doing this to yourself? *Fuuccckk.* Almost crunch time. Gotta get serious. *Motherfucker

.

You feel sore. Stressed. The ache in your head has gotten worse. Your thoughts are becoming more cluttered. Less focused

.

*Fuck. God. Why the fuck is this happening? How the fuck have I not started working yet? Seriously, my spark? Like, if I don't start working right now, I might actually fucking fail.*

.

*Whatever. Man the fuck up. This is happening. And you can't afford to crash and burn. Not now. Not like this. This is not how your story ends. Motherfucker

.

You glance at the clock. 2:00 AM. The bits and scraps of work you've done throughout the day are starting to come together. But you're nowhere near finished. Just thinking about the remaining workload makes you more weary. You're tired. So fucking tired...  *Motherfucker

.

4:00 AM. You're too stressed and tired. Every time your eye lids close

.

Going to sleep will be a sweet mercy. God knows you could use the much needed rest to clear your head and restore your energy. You'd love to sleep for the next 20 hours. But you know that you're going to have to wake up in just a few hours. You're going to wake up extremely tired and with a headache. But you're going to have a productive morning. You're going to somehow finish this shit. You always do. Sheer adrenaline will get you through it. *Sweet dreams

* Why I've done some incredibly stupid things lacking foresight, and just general ""Well I'm ___ now, so I can't see why I'd need something that I actually know full-well that I will need, but for some reason LALALA OUT THE DOOR I GO"".

* Why difficult projects and tasks involving external pressure have never been a problem

* Why I've felt much more impulsive than people around me. Luckily not to the point of destroying relationships (I think I'm more on the inattentive side, I have to have it NOW NOW NOW! I even did it yesterday; after spending the entire day reading about ADHD, I read about Omega-3 oils being helpful and ran immediately out the the store. At 2am. To buy cod liver oil.

* Why it's always been either all or nothing for me. Either no focus

* Why I've way too often had 100% real and honest interest in something, that thing"". And feel incredibly stupid; why can't my brain at least remind me from time to time? Other people do that, why couldn't I? I guess I know now.

* Why I've been able to read at a blistering pace since I was 4, other bits of information contained in an easily digested pill? I've read more of those than are galaxies in the universe. That's my go-to procrastination coping method; ""I'm reading, that can't be unproductive, right? Right?!"". But I have read the first two chapters of at least 50 books.

* Why I've felt like my brain goes faster than my body. Saying things wrong because my brain had moved on

* Why I've... suddenly lost interest in writing this post

***

This month I want to welcome Dr. David Nowell Ph.D. [@davidnowell](http://www.twitter.com/davidnowell) who is a clinical neuropsychologist. I met David back in October when he was the keynote speaker of our ADHD conference. I was doing work behind the scenes so unfortunately I could only catch some of his talks

After talking with him for a bit afterwards I mentioned /r/ADHD just as we were leaving. He was actually familiar with Reddit and said he would check us out. **He wrote a blog featuring /r/ADHD for online peer support a couple weeks later which you can find [here](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/intrinsic-motivation-and-magical-unicorns/201210/online-peer-support-adult-adhd)** (looks like he published this when Reddit was down...or he broke reddit). Later I asked him if he would be interested in doing an Expert AMA on /r/ADHD and he agreed! So here it is!

&gt;David D. Nowell, focus, and fully-engaged living.

* [Dr. Nowell's Psychology Today Blog: Intrinsic Motivation and Magical Unicorms](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/intrinsic-motivation-and-magical-unicorns)

* His twitter [@davidnowell](http://www.twitter.com/davidnowell)

* [Watch his 2 minute video on living an engaged life](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=VkuTpGfXeJc)

***

* You can start asking/voting on questions right now. David will be by to answer the most popular questions (or questions he enjoys). 
* He will be using the name dnowell (after this week he won't just be a lurker anymore!)
* If you didn't get your question answered last time
* Questions may not be answered for a couple days! Be patient! **We want everyone to have a chance to ask a question.**

***

*Remember to upvote the questions you want answered (and upvote this thread as well). We want everyone subscribed to /r/ADHD to see this on their front page!*

####EDIT: Dr. Nowell has started answering questions and will do so throughout the week when he has time. Continue to upvote and ask questions! He is still answering as of 2/12/13

You get in a fight with your girlfriend or someone across from you being really loud when you're trying to study? The more you think about it

**So open up a word document, enjoy your clutter-free mind and get to studying.**

Everything makes sense. Fucking everything. I've dealt with and been medicated for depression (on and off) for over ten years now

All the depression, never ending worry, forgetfulness, inability to concentrate (and alternatively, the ability to suddenly become obsessed with one specific thing for days on end), messiness, disorganised lifestyle, incredibly complicated

 I thought I was broken. I thought I just had an inability to relate to other people and to life. I would constantly tell myself that my brain was hardwired wrong and there was nothing I could do about it. I had resigned myself to a life of achieving nothing except superb Internet surfing skills and constantly fucking up jobs.

I thought I would include some helpful information in addition to this reminder for those of you who are thinking ""OMG that is tomorrow? *""But I am busy today and tomorrow! I have no time. But I hate filling out forms...What am I going to doooo!!!?""*

* Is your adjustable gross income below $57

* If you made more than 57

* Not sure where you put your tax forms or if you own a business you don't want to add up all those checks you cashed? **File an extension!** Looks like you can easily file an extension using the Free File link above. It takes just a couple minutes IIRC.

#### You will need to file the extension by the due date (tomorrow 4/15/13) so don't put this off! This will give you an extra 6 months to procrastinate!

I will include other useful links if anyone puts those in the comments...Hope this was helpful for someone!

**When it matters

 Whether it’s selecting your college major, choose the stuff that comes naturally to you and that you enjoy. If you want a “challenge” by foraying into an area that you aren’t comfortable with, do it on your own time, with something that won’t impact you down the line. 

I learned to fly planes, college majors and career choices that fit with what you like to do at the time. If you want to try calculus, but you just aren’t very good at it, wait until after you have graduated and then pick it up with a continuing education course where you can fail, and still succeed. You don’t want to have to struggle when your future is on the line.

**Don’t let the fact that you have ADHD define you to others.**

ADHD is a real condition
ADHD is not a shameful secret, think again. And then think about it again. And think about it a third time. I have shared my “ADHD tendencies” with one manager, but I never shared that I was officially diagnosed.

If all you talk about among your peers, then you are emblazoning yourself with a label. They will define you primarily by your disability. They will seek out evidence of your disability in your behaviors, noting behaviors or oddities that they then blame on your ADHD, that ordinarily they would have just dismissed.

You have an advantage that others with physically obvious disabilities don’t have. You know you have a disability, you are asking only to be viewed through a lens of “disability”. You can succeed in this world without having to show your hand. Give it a chance. No one cares that you have ADHD nearly as much as you do. And in business, where there's a bottom line, they damn sure won't have any interest in giving you ""more leeway"" just because of that. 

*******

I know it's not a book of tips, you'll find that you can do more than you've ever dreamed of, but you have to do it in a way that sets you up for success, not failure. Challenge yourself on your own terms, not the terms of your school or work. And never define yourself by ADHD. You're much more than that and you are selling yourself far too short if you think that's your defining characteristic.",,False,t5_2qnwb,True

**Your ADHD does not define your personality, just makes you more you. It is an executive function disorder. That means that your high-level control over your brain is limited compared to other people.

**Studying**
__________

Studying with ADHD is a real pain

* Don't do your homework at home.  Seriously, music, etc... And often times when you first get home all you want to do is lie down on your couch and relax for a bit.  Instead do your homework at the library, a nearby coffee house, or some other quiet place in which you can relax and study.  I recommend the library because it is quiet, and you have walls filled with resources all around you.

* If you have to do homework at home make yourself a quiet study corner with no distraction nearby.  Maybe between your bed and a wall, the TV should not be in the vicinity, and be sure to keep all aquariums and the like far away.

* Set yourself minigoals and time limits.  I'm dead serious when I say that if I don't have a deadline, I just can't do it.  My solution to this is to set my *own* deadlines, and not the second before it is due.  Say, ""I need to start doing this assignment at 6:00 and it needs to be finished by 7:00"".  If you achieve your goal reward yourself with a break, some food, a walk outside, etc...

* I cannot recommend enough the 15-minute-interval-method (a form of Pomodoro technique).  I mentioned it in my last post

^5:00-5:15 = math homework

^5:15-5:30 = English homework

^5:30-5:45 = Break

^5:45-6:00 = History homework

^6:00-6:15 = Math homework

^6:15-6:30 = Read

^6:30-6:45 = Break

^6:45-7:00 = History homework

Did you notice that on the second round the second interval was no longer English homework and had become Read?  That is because you finished the English homework and now had something new in that time slot.  Name as many time slots for a specific thing as you think you will need.  For example

* When doing homework the break is vital.  At least once per hour, then do something you enjoy for a few minutes.  It refreshes your mind.

* Starting late when it comes to studying for tests is bad.  Very bad.  You have to start studying earlier on if you want to do well on the test.  I have as much trouble with this as any of you

Okay that is all I have gotten so far.  I have enough room on this post to add suggestions from the comments so if you have anything to add I would be glad to put it up here.

Hope I have helped

Peri123

**EDIT**

 From /u/theinklings : In addition to the interval method, I'll break it into 'transcribe interviews' 'isolate quotes' 'write lead' and so on. For me, it makes tasks less daunting and gives me some easy to reach goals.

From /u/es_aye_em : I totally agree on the part with studying at home. It's difficult because of all the distractions I have around me in the room. Usually what I do when I have some intense studying or project doing at home is I prepare for the day early and quickly (brushing teeth, take daily supplements, medicine, etc.) then I have my work station organized, put out my notepad, untangle wires, clear as much things from my desk as I can that I don't need (coin jars, papers that I don't need to see, with my back facing away the bed, clear things out of the way even though they're behind me and I can't see. Just knowing that my room is spotless and clean puts my kind at ease and I can concentrate better.

From /u/Velocecat : 
Block everything on your computer that you waste time with during the hours you want to be productive.

Don't SIT at your desk. Try a standing desk. Mine is a japanese table on the floor. I sit on my knees and fidget with a pen while working. I can move around a lot and stay on task.

I disable my wifi

I use strict pomodoro to force me to break every 15 minutes. During my breaks I do physical work. Jumping jacks

I also have my girlfriend gently remind me when I'm spacing out or wasting time. She keeps me honest. She is hyper organized and I'm very spontaneous. It works out great. Make a friend who is the opposite of you :)

From /u/BCsteve : The absolute most useful thing that I've done to improve my studying is install an application called SelfControl on my computer... (It's got a scary icon, that means facebook and reddit. No matter how hard you try, you can't reverse it until the time runs out. So for me, when I get that moment of lucidity where I'm like ""OK. I have to study now."" I'll start the program and block things for around 45 minutes. I find that the biggest problem I have without it is just mindlessly opening up a new tab and flipping to reddit without even thinking about it, then I'll see an interesting post, and that derails my train of thought and it'll be another hour before it gets back on track. With the program running, it'll pop up with a ""webpage not found"" error, that's right, then repeat the cycle again. It's only by forcefully restricting myself that I've managed to get things done.

Also from /u/velocecat : I'd like to add on to your ""don't cram"" thing: it seems common that people in ADHD have a really terrible short term memory.

This ended up being very true when I went through the 8 hour evaluation.

It seems that if I remember something

This may be true for you all as well
I had a lot of memorization in my pharmacology class. Most of my classmates crammed the week before the test. I broke everything down in flashcards and reviewed them for 15 minutes (seems to be the magic number) every day since the start of the semester.

It took very little time and when I was taking the test

From /u/V3nturetheworld : I like this list of things! I suggest something to keep you active, for some reason speakers are distracting to me, and the music should have little to no lyrics as well. I also suggest, while it probably isn't the healthiest thing, is to have lots of caffein such as coffee or redbull to drink (not tons but some just to give you a boost when the meds are starting to not work to their fullest potential), I hear alot of people with ADHD use tobbacco for the nicotine stimulant part, I feel this isn't very healthy in any way BUT if you wish for just the nicotine (highly addictive though) I suggest an Electronic Cigerette or Swedish Snus, especially cardio workouts

Another tip I have learned from a friend. I personally study and do work better early in the morning when no distractions are present. To maximize this I learned that, have a second alarm set for a half hour later to wake you up, so when this alarm wakes you up the medicine will have kicked in and you will feel focused with a perfect mix of being tired and awake so that you are less distracted by the things around you.

1359165386.0,17akdm,I have read a lot online and on this subreddit about tips for dealing with ADHD.  Here is my compilation.,peri123,136,17,44,"_____________________________________________________________


**Hyperactivity**

For a lot of people with ADHD

* When you are in one of those situations where you *have* to sit still and you feel physically like you can't still any longer, as it has a similar effect.

* Keep a small lump of no-dry clay, or really anything that works for you with you at all times. Fidgeting has been proven to help with all forms of ADHD (both Attention and Hyperactivity) as it keeps your brain awake and lets you spend less time worrying about what your body parts are doing (happens to me all the time with my hyperactivity) and more time focusing. [Here is an article on the benefits of fidgeting](http://phys.org/news162554898.html)

* Make sure to do some form of exercising every single day, right after you wake up.  This will get some of your excess energy out before work/school as well as provide stimulation.  You can also work out before bed and this may make it easier for you to sleep at night.  [Here is an article on the benefits of exercise for ADHD](http://www.everydayhealth.com/health-report/adult-adhd/treatment.aspx)

* If you are in a work atmosphere where this is an opportunity, step outside for some fresh air.  This is especially easy if you work at home.  If you work in a cubicle, even just standing for a minute and stretching can help.

___________________________________________________________

**Impulsivity**

The main symptoms of Impulsivity are doing things without thinking

* Before you act, but eventually you will develop the skills to stop and think before acting.

* Before you just blurt something out, and you will not gain results unless you work hard at it.  It will be a pain, but you *will* see results.  Think of conversations as time to practice.  When you are chatting with your parents or friends, think about *everything* you even consider saying.  Trust me,  practice makes perfect.

___________________________________________________________

**Inattentiveness**

As one of the biggest issues related to ADHD

1. **Memory**:

Memory is a huge part of inattentiveness

* Loose objects like keys, etc... are commonly lost by us ADHDers.  How to stop losing these essential objects you ask?  Bowls.  That is it.  Bowls.  Keep a bowl right inside the door of your house to toss you keys and wallet into.  Put a bowl in your room/kitchen/living room and be sure to put your phone into the bowl of whatever room you are in.  Keep a bowl in your office and put all of your stuff into the bowl when you get there.

* Notebooks.  Notebooks are my everything.  Actually, and it is best to have everything in one place.  Put in to-do lists, schedules, reminders, future events... Your notebook is your best friend.  Write everything down.  *Everything*.  If you need to remember something *write it in the notebook*.

* Sticky notes.  Sticky notes are great reminders.  Put a sticky note on your front door saying :

                              Do you have your:

                              Wallet

                              Phone

                              Car keys

                              Anything else you may need

Put the same thing on the door to your office/workplace to make sure you remember it all.  Basically

2. **Motivation** 

I'm not gonna lie to you, I probably won't do it.  It is time to fix that.

* Come up with a reward system.  For example

* Schedule a specific *time* to do it.  Are you gonna do it if it is just sitting on your to-do list?  Hell no.  If you have a specific set time

* Feel free to check out /r/motivation for quotes and such for you to get off your butt and do what you've gotta do.

3. **Inattentiveness**

When I was in fourth grade my teacher called me and my parents in for a private parent-teacher conference.  She told my parents

She went on to describe a variety of ways to help improve my focus and keep me calm

* Go into a dark room and eliminate all sources of light.  Take a flashlight in with you, rapidly moving it around.  try to keep your eyes on the beam.  In the dark room there is nothing to look at, so you will automatically want to focus on the light.  It is a good brain training exercise.

* There are websites where you can train your brain to focus better and remember better.  www.lumosity.com is one that I enjoy in particular.

* Try to work in 15 minute intervals.  I have found this incredibly beneficial

^ 9:00-9:15 = Math homework

^ 9:15-9:30 = organize file cabinet

^ 9:30-9:45 = break

^ 9:45-10:00 = History homework

^ 10:00-10:15 = Math Homework

^ 10:15-10:30 = Organize file cabinet

^ 10:30-10:45 = Break

^ 10:45-11:00 = English homework.

If I finish something during that time slot then I can open up all of the time slots I had scheduled for it later on to do what I want.  If I don't finish something in the number of slots I had set up for it

___________________________________________________________

**Sleeping**

I know there have been other guides on this (and much better than mine

* Have a glass of warm milk before bed

* Wake up early everyday because then you will get less and less sleep and therefore be more tired when you go to bed at night.  Plus

* Make sure to get exercise during the day

*  Read before bed.  I always read before bed.  Read until you are practically falling asleep as you read the page and your eyes are slipping out of focus

__________________________________________________________

**Waking up** 

Boy

* Set an alarm to go off twenty minutes before you actually need to get up.  Make sure it is an irritating sound that pisses you off until you just have to get up.  Make sure to set the alarm clock a good 10 feet or more from the bed so that you need to actually stand up to turn it off.

* Set another alarm to go off ten minutes after the first one

* Set another one to go off when you actually need to get up.  The second and third are just in case you don't get up on the first one.

* Reward yourself with a delicious breakfast for waking up on time!

#####Science behind Win Wednesday (new)

* Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect

 * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting

* By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field.

 * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve

* **Soak in the positive events in your life**

 * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer

*I have much more information on the neuroscience of recognizing the good

***

Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!

###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***

* **Each and every one of us have victories every week

* **Whatever ""level"" you happen to be at

* **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won

***

* The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win

* **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views

***

##### PHENOMENAL EXAMPLES FROM PAST WEEKS: (updated 2/27)

* All the dishes are washed

* I asked a girl on a date and she said yes.

* I cleaned out my fridge and organized leftovers!

* Agreed to participate in a very challenging dance performance that I very likely would have declined in the past.

* have kept impulse buys to a minimum

* Learned how to make bullet points on Reddit:p

* No heroin or sleeping pills since thursday I think. Planning on going until forever

* Made a wedding decision about the officiant (finally)

1.) Waking up in the morning.
2.) Starting tasks.

I have some solutions to these problems that I promise if you give a try will work for you. They manipulate the ADHD psyche in an awesome way as far as i'm concerned.

1.) Waking up in the morning: Get as many alarms as you need to wake up in the morning. It's super simple and effective. Even better if you don't have to program them daily,20?!?! Doesn't matter. Go to goodwill get all the alarm clocks you need and start setting them up about a minute to five minutes apart in all the rooms you need to go in to in the morning. I put one by my bedside table so I wake up in the morning, I put one in my closet so i'm forced to get out of bed and turn it off, I then grab really warm clothes while i'm there, and the alarm in my bathroom goes off. I go in to take a piss and the kitchen alarm goes off, lo and behold five minutes later the shower alarm goes off. You'll be up at this point trust me. If not keep setting alarms. There is even an android app that does this! It won't turn off until you have reached certain points in your house! No excuses, just solutions!

2.) Starting tasks: Get rid of your ability to sit down. It seems simple but it works so well. It's infinitely harder to REDDIT standing up. Try it

This is a hard condition to have, we aren't impaired, we aren't diseased, we simply have to do things differently than everyone else. We can focus as well as anyone, just not when there are too many distractions, we can be on time just like anyone else we just have to set 20 alarms to do it etc. Whenever I need a solution to a problem, I think ""What would I HAVE to be doing to ensure this get's done?"" and I mean to the EXTREME. How do I make it so NOT completing this task will be very very painful or boring or uncomfortable for me? Those are the enemies of ADHD: Pleasure, Comfort. Rid yourself of them and then relish in them at the end of the day when you have conquered the world. Like our hunter forefathers the hunt is not supposed to be fun, completing tasks,False

----

For as long as I can remember, only excuses:

If difficult tasks are easy for me

This mentality has been a prevailing theme of my life. I wonder if procrastination is a learned habit from not being challenged enough in youth: if I don't really care about this book report beyond its effect on my grade, but we all know what happens when we're out of school and working on a project we actually care about: we think about it *every day*, but just can't seem to keep our nose to the grindstone.

It turns out that I wasn't really supposed to learn about Tom Sawyer in high school; I was supposed to learn how to care about what I'm doing

My precocious aptitude allowed me to fart around through all of high school and most of college. The first time I received a failing grade on anything, when I received an F in Advanced Computer Science Projects. In my defense, the professor presented his reasoning very poorly. In all honesty, however, he could have beamed the truth directly into my brain and I still wouldn't have listened. At the ripe age of 27, I understand now that he failed me not for any of the reasons he stated, but because I *didn't really get anything done*, clear as day

I was apoplectic (a fun word for ""super-duper angry""), and finally, just depressed. I sobbed. How could I fail *programming*? It's what I'm good at! Sure, this was the most ambitious academic task I've ever undertaken: an entire semester working on *one project*. But I did great! Didn't I? Yeah. Of course I did! I convinced myself that I had done nothing wrong, that my professor was a dickbag, and redoubled my efforts next term. The next class I took was much more structured--which didn't seem relevant to me at the time--and I nailed it. Problem solved, right?

It seemed that way at the time. I had always been a great programmer. When I was 12, complete with persistent character sheets and automatic chatroom notifications when someone reached critical health levels.

In high school, teach some kids to program."" Mr. Powsner, whose lush Ned Flanders mustache and shameless nerdly self-awareness I will never forget, dove into the responsibility with gusto, but made no claim at being an expert on the subject. At that point, I had already taken an individual interest in programming, and routinely finished my work within a few short minutes. After the fifth day in a row that I ended up wandering around the classroom helping other students and resolving quandaries that confounded even the venerable Mr. P

No one ever noticed that I had ADHD. How could I? I was a great student and a (mostly) happy kid. I wasn't being challenged yet.

In my first job out of college, because I sat a few yards from a fridge full of free soda. (I was in Ohio, so technically it was ""free *pop*"".) I chugged upwards of three cans a day and inflated to 260 pounds, but I was a goddamn rockstar. The work was challenging, but it was the underdog and I was the champion. I asked for help when I needed it, but I never needed help with the act of programming itself.

I have a unique talent for solving code problems. I spend a long time reading the code, hands off the keyboard, iterating over the infinite permutations and turning the code-shapes every which way. Vanishingly few people can do this with the same consistency and confidence. The flow of the program is like a river, and each logical branch is a tributary. I watch them branch out, and out again, and rejoin the main body, or terminate in an edge condition. I can see the data flowing, because I must first resolve the myriad mini-problems obscuring it. I refactor. Code shrinks. Five hundred lines become a hundred. One gargantuan chunk of code becomes a dozen smaller, twenty are now solved by two. Now I sit back and visualize the shapes again. Always

Okay, I'm so cool, yadda yadda. What's my supervillain weakness, then?

Once the health concerns of 1, without the self-medication, I was no match for the twin serpents of Work Stress and Relationship Stress. I fell into a deep depression, almost got fired, and finally began the process of diagnosis and treatment. I've written about all that before.

Without treatment of any kind (neither caffeine nor therapy nor amphetamines), or write an essay. I played a lot of video games: with their juicy interfaces and positive feedback loops, they were one of the only things that could consistently keep the channel from changing.

Now, I cap out at around four hours. They're not always consecutive, though they sometimes are. Maybe I worked for two hours, cooked dinner for 30 minutes, exercised for an hour, and played guitar for another 30 minutes. If I play my cards right, it can be enough. If I only work for two hours, in my heart of hearts. When I'm actually working consistently, where all I do is answer e-mails

I often wonder--fantasize, two weeks, what would it be like if I could really consistently sustain my focus for six hours, or eight hours, or sixteen hours? When I was first diagnosed at 23, I tended to cap out at two hours. Will I keep getting better at focusing, so that by the time I'm thirty, or backslide? Will I have an epiphany tomorrow

I was wondering if any others with ADHD (particulary PI) have experienced a noticeable lack of empathy towards others, that I have trouble empathizing with others when they come to me for support.  For example, my best friend came over the other day having just found a good job after months of unemployment, and he was crazy excited and wanted to tell me all about it.  A normal person would be happy for their friend, but I just felt indifferent.  I went through the motions and congratulated him, asked him about his job, etc.

At that moment I realized that I had been the same way for as long as I can remember.  Even with past girlfriends, I just couldn't feel sad for them, even though I really did care about them.  I feel like i'm emotionally stunted, and would give anything to be able to sympathize with others, or be happy for others achievements.

Even beyond empathy, happiness, anger, etc.  I realize that what i'm saying probably sounds like depression, but I truly don't think that's the case.  I don't feel depressed about anything, and I'm actually quite content with the way my life has turned out so far, even in spite of my ADHD.  I've never had suicidal thoughts, and I don't think poorly of myself (aside from the issue i'm discussing here).  To me it just feels like there's this thick fog inside my head that makes me feel completely detached from myself

So is it just me?  are there are any of you out there who've had similar experiences

**In the past 43 days we have added 1252 new reADHDitors!** Back in January we had 1000 TOTAL!
The mods had been taking a hands-off approach (never removing threads), and overwhelm due to the number of rant threads, simple questions as posts, and the sheer number of posts.**

***

&gt;WARNING. THIS POST IS  LONG

***

What the mods have done so far:

* Started removing similar duplicate posts AFTER linking the OP a list of similar threads.
* Implemented post tagging to describe poor titled posts and identify quality threads
* Added additional text on posting page to remind about searching and descriptive titles

***

## Proposed new posting rules
1. [Search /r/adhd for previous posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/search?q=adhd+keywords&amp;restrict_sr=on) Consider linking to a couple or sharing what you found out...and then ask your question that was not answered in those threads.
2.  **Vague titled posts (‘This happened to me at school’...’Has anyone felt this?’) will be removed.** Post your question in the title. There is ALWAYS space.
3. **Meme/comics** - When posting a picture or a meme
4. **Do not title your post with DAE.** Odds are people have. Please use a more descriptive and specific title pertaining to your post. 
5. **No posts asking about drug side effects.** Search google or ask in the weekly medication thread. 
        
* Side effects vary person-to-person. Every person has a unique reaction to medication.
        
* Talk to your doctor (or your pharmacist -- they are specialized doctors) about the side effects! Set an appointment or call and leave a message.
        
* This information is easily found online at [drugs.com](http://www.drugs.com/sfx/adderall-side-effects.html) or many past addforums.com forum posts.

#6. No AMAs which are not pre-approved by the mods.  (See #2-5). *We want to make sure the person doing the AMA has unique experience and knowledge.*

***

## Community Guidelines
**The mods can only do so much and we really need the whole community to help make this the best place possible. Here are some guidelines which would really help /r/adhd out!**

1. **UPVOTE UPVOTE UPVOTE the good (constructive/positive, and is just a nice thing to do. 
2. If you see a **post/comment which violates the rules downvote AND click the report button.** This will flag it for the mods.
3. If you see a post that politely adds to discussion *even if you don’t agree with the content
4. Be civil and respect everyone’s opinion.

(Courses are blacked out because it is easy to identify me

For the first time in my life, I feel that I owe all of you my thanks.

I was diagnosed in my first year of college (these are my spring, I had been diagnosed with depression, general anxiety disorder, social anxiety, OCD, and a bunch of other stuff, before realizing that ADHD was also there. ADHD prevented me from staying awake in class, and prevented me from being punctual. Depression didn't help

I decided to get help, she was in my insurance network)), after reoccurring suicidal thoughts. I worked on my depression and anxiety problems, but I still had my problems. 

When we diagnosed ADHD as a source of my problems, not because I had ADHD, but because I found a source for my problems, and now it could be treated. Since then, I have made it my goal to stay organized through sets of post-it notes (to keep important reminders in check), calendars, and a whiteboard accessible at all times (to jot down notes).  Medication has helped too. 

To anyone who thinks they might have ADHD, get help, and help yourself. If you think you might have ADHD, see a doctor. You won't lose anything, you can only win. However, medication is not the cure all. It helps you focus and motivate yourself, but the rest of your power comes intrinsically. 

Do whatever you feel will help you make a difference whether it comes to reading, and our problem sometimes is that we forget that time is short. Remind yourself, and above all else, stay calm.

For many, having a dry mouth/throat/lips all the time is fucking uncomfortable. If you find yourself getting sick more frequently since starting stimulant medication, and/or constantly suffering from cotton mouth, try brushing, flossing and mouth washing neurotically. 

I find this helps my overall well being a shit-ton. I always got a super dry mouth and throat when I first started taking medication for ADHD , sleeping with a dry mouth/throat/nose was very uncomfortable too, and stopped me from ever getting into a really deep sleep stage.

I started violently flossing (strangely satisfying on the meds I have to say) as well as using mouth wash a few times a day, once I had started doing this for about 3 weeks. I can't really say for sure that those things are correlated, but it seems to make sense that not having a dry, inflamed virus farm in my throat all the time would lead to better health.

1358958270.0,174mk9,[Story]This reddit is helping me save my relationship and I would like to thank all of you,Mister_Kipper,87,4,16,"**The Story**

Hello everyone

As you all know

Until you helped me understand what ADHD really is

Thanks to all of you I was able to figure out a solution.

**The problem**

The main issue, we  could never fathom how important it was to get everything started (and finished).

I've been basically alone in the house while she spends a few weeks at her mother's. In this state, shower and sleep properly. Right before reaching a ""critical"" state, I found this subreddit.

**Finding a solution**

Thanks to knowing what the real implications of having ADHD were

I also remembered how I was a complete pest when younger, I'm gonna give you an ice-cold shower"", I started to control myself - knowing the that acting this way would instantly result in something I considered completely awful made me acknowledge this and control myself.

**The crisis**

A couple of days back, without grasping how a simple change could both improve this for both of us as well as spicing things up.

I broke into a monologue where I explained how this was not a burden


**The idea**

The concept is fairly simple - you're supposed to bring imaginary rules and challenges into your partner's life as well as your own... along with rewards you both know you want. This has to start with each being capable to deny the other something that put you in a comfort zone and you always took for granted (ie: cuddling to sleep

The way this works is I can propose a challenge to her

By making these challenges we can easily be productive while feeling better

I'm not sure if this was clear enough or rather confusing - so I'll leave an example of one of the first challenges I made for her:

Objective: Make a challenge for me (to get this started)
Penalty: Until you do so
Reward: Removal of the penalty


**Conclusion**
I really don't know if I was clear enough

A big awkward hug to all of you - I certainly hope I didn't make too many mistakes or misunderstand what I've learned and that this experience may help at least one of you in your relationship :)

**TL;DR:**

~

**Sleeping starts with waking up**

I know the feeling. Your alarm bell rings at 7 o'clock, NO. If you decide to sleep in (and as a lazy college student that's a really easy decision to make) you won't be able to fall asleep the following evening. If I wake up tired, that means I have a slightly better chance of falling asleep without a struggle the following night.

~

**Food**

Make sure you eat enough during the day. When I take my dexies


Try to eat a lot of fruit and veggies. Even though vitamin C makes your urine acidic and causes meds like dexamphetamine and adderall to be flushed out of your system quicker

Don't drink caffeïne

Don't eat a lot of sugary goodness after dinner either

~

**Exercise**

Make yourself tired. I own a horse, not so great for winding down after a long day. Take a walk outside instead. 

~

**Lights**

Like I said above

Switch your tv and computer off 2 hours before bedtime, if you have to use your computer install f.lux and dim the screen.

If you don't mind looking dorky

~

**Going to bed**

Go to bed when you are tired. Make sure your bedroom is full of fresh air, ideas are listed below. Don't get mad at yourself for not falling asleep! If you are unable to fall asleep after 30 minutes, get up and read a book in a really uncomfortable chair until you get sleepy again. 

If you are sleepy and can't fall asleep (like I have all the time) don't get mad or frustrated. You are lying in bed, get up and read a book or something. I love painting, so I get out of my bed and paint.

It's important to keep your bedroom for sleeping and having sex only. Don't watch tv

If you can't sleep and you've tried everything, snuggle a bit deeper into your soft warm blankets, it's nice lying in bed!

~

**Relaxation exercises**

There are a million relaxation exercises available online. Try searching youtube for 'sleep meditation' and do a meditation exercise before going to bed every night. I like doing these exercises, while my head isn't really sleeping at least my body can relax.

I'll write a bigger guide to relaxation exercises. For now

!!**I finished the guide! You can find it [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/171eja/you_guys_liked_my_guide_to_sleeping_heres_a_guide/)**!!

**Finding a balance in your medication**

I've noticed I fall asleep easier about 3-4 hours after I've taken my meds (10 mg dexies

I also take the weekends off

~

**Supplements**

Some things that might help

- Melatonin (supplement) avalaible from your doctor and your local pharmacy

- Magnesium (supplement) available from your local pharmacy (thanks to /u/eawsound )

- Lemon balm (herb)

==

1. **Excersize**. - I was out of shape. So, I started feeling a bit more active and energetic, but that went away. Soon, the workouts became boring and I had to trudge through them just to stay active the whole hour.

2. **Eating super healthy foods**. I like doing keto

3. **/r/nofap** - What a load of bull. Literally no effect.

4. **Chicken livers**. - Sometimes anemia will put people into a fog. I thought I had low iron in my blood, but that wore off after a day or two.

5. **Ketosis** itself. - Still thinking it was my diet, because the feelgood period lasted quite a while (5 days). Then, it wore off again.

6. **Self-diagnosis** - ""Man, *depression symptoms*... oh my god, I have depression! I didn't feel sad... well maybe I do... but I don't feel suicidal."" Later on, ""hmm, I go through 'periods' of good and bad, like a wave. Let's... *bipolar symptoms*. Oh my god, I have bipolarism! This explains everything!""

6. **Counceling** - At my college, I felt very uncomfortable and I felt like she had no clue what she was doing. She was an intern.

7. **B12** - I can really see the relationship between having energy and being happy/able to focus. B12 vitamins had no noticeable effect.

8. **Meditation** - This actually helped with my negative self-thought

9. **[Breathing exersizer](http://www.amazon.com/Ultrabreathe-ASI7492-Compact-Breathing-Exerciser/dp/B0000E2PBX/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365539345&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=breath+exerciser).** - Around the time I started using one a few times a day

10. **Coffee** - this is the only thing that has any kind of effect

11. **Finally finding out** - ""Ugh, yeah /r/all. Oh, what's this? A /r/bestof post of somebody explaining what ADHD feels like? Sure I'll bite, I like getting other people's perspectives. Whoa, I feel like that, whoa, that too... whoa

12. **Doctors** - 

Me: Hi
Doctor: You don't have ADHD
Me.... *cry* sorry I'll go now...

* Custom Desktop Backgrounds on Paint with Lists of things to Remember

* Always email myself a copy of papers/documents etc

* Use Google Voice (in Gmail) to help you find your lost cellphone!

I (24M) have been in university for five years

-1st year  - BFF suicided

-2nd year - Continued to struggle but had to face the reality: my grades were dropping hard. Finally saw school counsellor and psychiatrist --&gt; diagnosed with major depression.

-3rd year - decided to take a year off.  

-4th year - back to school. Things got better with some ups &amp; downs. Found out I have ADHD and started Concerta.  

-5th year (currently) - Fall term was great... 

But starting from around December (2012), and all I felt was fear, anger and shame. Most of my HS friends have graduated, some are in great career paths and life goals...stuff like that. I was well aware of that before but I have never felt the shame and sadness. It struck me. I almost cried that moment. I feel like I have failed the people that care about me and I don't want to continue, cuz I will just keep on failing. From that point, I think I lost the last bit of my willpower. I don't know what my future looks like. Everyone around me (in school especially) seems to be so motivated like they are beaming out sunlight, while I am stuck in a freaking dark corner.

My mood can swing from happy to sad to angry and to whatever within moments and apparently I was in a time of weakness and exhaustion. I guess I just have to let my mind ~~flow~~ fly like that. I don't have someone in real life to talk to about things related to ADD/ADHD

1360470513.0,188cqr,Tips for dealing with ADHD in social situations. [Guide],peri123,84,11,31,"Having ADHD can make it very difficult to hold conversations with people

For ADHD specifically there are three areas in which I believe most ADHDers struggle in conversation:

* Impulsivity makes it very hard for us to wait our turn while someone is talking.  We also have a tendency to blurt things out that are totally unrelated to the conversation at hand.  Sometimes

* Inattentiveness makes us get distracted and even zone out during conversations that we don't find interesting.  This is bad because then you don't remember a word your friends said to you

* Hyperactivity can make you talk really fast

___

Impulsivity:

I like to treat this as a kind of game, take one breath.  One breath.  Then do a quick mental checklist:

* Is this relevant to what they are saying?

* Am I interrupting the person I am talking to?

* Is this going to be even a little bit insulting to the person?

It's a conscious effort that takes time to master

____

Inattentiveness:

Another game-like solution!

* Try to picture them as being someone incredibly interesting.  Who do you wish you could talk to more than anybody else?  Pretend that the person talking to you is this person.

* Make a conscious effort to focus on the conversation.  Think of it like a competition: ""If I can focus on what this person is saying for the entire time, sit there and consciously listen to what they are saying.  Again, it takes practice, but you will get it if you work hard enough and don't give up on it.

____

Hyperactivity:

* Calm down.  Seriously, and a lot.  I stutter too, or slur words together, or change the subject about a million times.  The trick is to *calm down*.  When you start to feel really excited (or angry) take a breath and count to ten.  Now don't get all, ""stop being a freaking school councilor"" on me.  It works.  It really does.

* When you are talking consider how fast you are talking.  Again this is a *conscious effort*.  You have to work hard at it.  When you are talking to someone take a moment about halfway through and ask the following:

        How fast am I talking?

        How loud am I talking?

        Does the person I am talking to look exhausted? (happens)

Once you have gone over your mental checklist

___

Hope I have helped!  I would be glad to add anyone else's recommendations if you have them!

  I was heated, and I should get in contact with the lab that did the test. 

 I called the lab

 I asked if the test was a ""zero tolerance"" test or if there was a cutoff.
Well come to find out, and I'm just trying to clear my name, and not be labeled a drug dealer. He seemed sympathetic, and told me the nurse was wont with trying to drop me so fast.

I have been reflecting back on these past nineteen years and can't help but feel like I missed out on life. I didn't know what ""normal"" felt like up until recently. Throughout the years my anxiety has worsened and my attention has deteriorated which has caused my friendships, but I am at least thankful that I found out and am able to actually excel now. Vyvanse has changed my life in the short amount of time I have been taking it! I can concentrate in class and have been making many friends and actually socializing. I joined the Pre-Law Society and have started pursuing the things I actually want to do instead of letting them pass me by. My real personality has started to come out and I have never felt happier in my whole entire life. Did anybody else feel this way right after their diagnosis?


EDIT: I am also passing all of my classes with A's and  B's now which is an improvement from the C's and D's from my previous semester. My grades are the main things that I am proud of too because I used to barely pass every class I enrolled in.

I want to start by saying you folks have all been amazing

To summarize what my past 6 weeks have looked like:  

* Yet another person asked me if I have ADHD. I said I've never been diagnosed but will look into it. That brought me here.  

* I was blown away by your stories

* Doctor orders blood work



Now
My doctor asks what's wrong, any information on my current living situation, on my daily habits, she immediately grills me with questions about my depression.  
As I explain myself, I want to know about you.""... 
 
**WELL MAYBE THAT'S HOW I EXPLAIN MYSELF!! EVER THINK ABOUT THAT
 
Sorry....  

Any way, and said my lack of motivation, my trouble concentration on paperwork, bills, and the mundane are because of a lack of motivation which are just symptoms of depression, and that I'm doing far too well in university to have ADHD, regardless of how much I procrastinate and put no effort into assignments

**So you're saying I have no motivation for some things

I'm feeling so defeated. She didn't let me explain myself

Maybe it is only depression

I haven't felt this shitty in quite some time.

*Just wanted to remind people to **upvote this post**. Recently

#####Science behind Win Wednesday (new)

* Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect
  * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting

* By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field. 
  * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve

* **Soak in the positive events in your life**
  * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer

*I have much more information on the neuroscience of recognizing the good

***

Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!

###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***

* **Each and every one of us have victories every week

* **Whatever ""level"" you happen to be at

* **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won

***
* The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win

* **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views

***

##### PHENOMENAL EXAMPLES FROM PAST WEEKS: (updated 5/21) **FRESH**

* After the worst semester of my crap college career I'm still
* This week I convinced an ADHD denier (some one who does not think ADHD is real) that ADHD is real. I also got an A+ for my interview with the town's mayor.
* I applied for TWO jobs! Count 'em! TWO!
* Despite really not wanting to
* I have just recently received my offer of admission! This will be my third time trying, and doing therapy.
* With the current exception of bedding, I've packed my entire dorm room up for moving completely by myself.
* taught my dog a new behavior
* This morning I made my bed.
* I convinced my self to go to the library and study. The most difficult part was getting out of bed.
* Besides that
* Approximately five weeks ago I picked up the KSS habit again
* Many many more!

Our brains are video games that we are constantly playing. Meditation is putting down the controller and looking away for a few seconds. 
Even just a few seconds a day


Find a comfortable spot. Sit or lay down
Deep breath in through the nose


Now


Here’s where it gets tricky


The difference between watching and participating:
Thoughts:
“I am sitting here like a jackass trying to meditate and I don’t even think I am doing this right. Does this shit actually work or not? Am I too stupid to get this? I have other things I could be doing like homework


The thoughts are the first three sentences


The participation in those thoughts or the fantasy


Adjust your mind to just watch your thoughts like a video. Be entertained or horrified


You will inevitably get frustrated because you won’t be able to resist the fantasies. When this happens


When you bring your awareness back to watching


Every time you meditate

I know most of you are students

My solution

1) Make a list of every task that needs to be done in the house

2) Group tasks by Daily, Quarterly, Annually.

3) Start an electronic calendar. I use Google Calendar because it syncs with my phone

4) Daily tasks obviously need to be done daily. Add them to the calendar if you need to and cross them off the list.

5) Weekly tasks - tricky. Put a lot of thought into your regular schedule and which days would be simplest to do which tasks. Add these tasks to the calendar with a ""Repeat Forever"" option.

6) Continue with the Monthly, etc. tasks.

This process takes some time and tinkering

* Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect
  * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting

* By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field. 
  * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve

* **Soak in the positive events in your life**
  * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer

*I have much more information on the neuroscience of recognizing the good

Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!

###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***

* **Each and every one of us have victories every week

* **Whatever ""level"" you happen to be at

* **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won

Perhaps I forget things as a coping mechanism that allows me to avoid the anxiety of dealing with them. Perhaps I daydream because I crave the escapism.

I reached a point earlier this year where it was clear the higher-ups at my office were building a case to fire me and I was hitting rock bottom. I started trying to figure out wtf was wrong with me and the more I read about ADHD the more ""oh wow, now adderall).

It's been a long road since then

Prior to treatment I was the lowest paid admin assistant in my office,000/year.

Over the past year I was able to train myself in a new skill and force my way into a position to gain experience. Today,000/year.

I've started noticing something lately, took a deep interest in learning French/studying sociology in both high school and college, and have played countless musical instruments over the years. But stepping back, I've noticed that I'm simply *okay* at all of these things. I've never really stuck out an interest long enough to really be good at something, or to excel in school (after eight years of undergrad, I got bored with majors and routinely changed them, then simply stopped going to school.)

Since my diagnosis I have come to understand that while it is something I struggle with

In my effort to bring order and balance into my life I began looking for apps that I could use to organize my day. I have tried many

1. Astrid Tasks - By far the best task-oriented app I have ever used. Favorite features: Allows you to share tasks via email or username (if they also use Astrid). Notifies you when tasks you have assigned have been completed and allows both parties to comment on tasks. Notifies you when a task is due and will not clear the notification until you either complete the task or snooze it. The notifications can be annoying

2. Routinely - Routinely is an app for your daily routines (medications

3. Mindjet - I have spent my entire life making lists. One of the things I have struggled with is my mind's inability to focus and tendency to jump all over the place. Enter Mindjet! Mindjet is a mind mapping app and quite possibly my favorite of all the apps I use. It lets my mind jump around and organize my thoughts. I can go back and forth between different subtopics and I don’t even have to worry about running out of room on my paper or ending up with a list that is virtually unreadable.

4. Evernote - I just downloaded this app and I don’t have a lot of experience with it, to-do’s, meetings etc. You can also store images of receipts or business cards, and even save audio notes! I was especially excited about the audio notes! Sometimes it’s so much easier to be able to think aloud and record my thoughts when my mind feels like it is going 100mph.

5. Mobile Banking App - I could  recommend my mobile banking app, if your bank does have a mobile application I suggest downloading it. I struggle with financial responsibility and having access to that information at the touch of my fingers has helped me regain control. Mint is a budget management and good for people whose banks do not have an app.  

All of these applications are free, has a premium version that includes widgets you can add to your home screen. If you have adult ADD and find yourself unable to organize your responsibilities, then download and try these applications. I hope they help and give you some piece of mind. Good luck!

Well CAPD evaluation looks at how well my brain processes sound.  Lo and behold

Even worse, giving one priority over the other. I hear each as though they were all the same level of sound.  A tick tock clock, which I feel is the most maddening sound in the world, sounds as loud as someone speaking to me and I have trouble directing my attention to one over the other. I can do it, but it takes tremendous effort, which is ultimately far more draining than a simple interaction needs to be. 

One test put me in between two speakers, hoping to catch up to all those sitting comfortably on it, engaged in the conversation.  I use context and hope what I am hearing is what is being conveyed and do my best to keep up.  I have perfect hearing and yet I can't always understand what is being said.  Kind of wild, no?  

After struggling to do my very best and make sense of what I was hearing, feeling as if I wasn't considerate or caring enough to really listen to them, when maybe it wasn't simply disinterest but actual disability.  I want to hear them, but if I can't hear them clearly, what else is my mind suppose to do  and for how long can it attempt to do that?

This particular audiology practice recommends patients with CAPD wear a filter in their subordinate ear, making that effort to hear, thus listen, far more efficient.  A mold of my ear was made and I should receive the filter in a few weeks.

That's a normal person

&gt;and the advice you get most often is ""well

&gt;and all that's happening is you try to waggle the noodle in the general direction of the target, but to something other than what you were aiming for and now you have to try to waggle it off.

&gt;and the reason it gets so frustrating as a child is because you get so confused getting all sorts of advice that's useful with a pole but you're left wondering how the heck to apply that to the noodle

I was actually really surprised how well this analogy describes my experiences with ADHD. It really only breaks down trying to describe how difficult it is for someone to articulate why they are having trouble applying all the advice they get.

After some therapy and serious introspection about why I have begun to expect myself to fail
I had a tough year last year, taking into account all the circumstances.  

I realized that allthough there are things I could have done better, I tried to do things right, and I hated that I didn't meet my or others expectations.  To me, this is proof that I am actually not a lazy person, and that instead of beating myself up for not getting things done, I should give myself ideas for how to better translate my wants, and goals into actions next year.

ADHD is just as real as pain

Pain is caused by prostaglandins, stop pain and swelling by limiting the effect that prostaglandins have on the body.  Opiates act on several bases to alleviate pain.  They primarily act upon the Mu receptors, reducing the flow of painful stimulants.  They also act upon the limbic pathways, reducing the emotional response to pain.

ADHD is caused by a lack of neurotransmitters (dopamine, exhibited by restlessness and distraction.  These constant external stimuli stimulate the brain to release a small amount of these neurotransmitters.  When one takes a stimulant (amphetamine, methylphenidate, cocaine, etc.), the brain either releases these neurotransmitters or blocks their reuptake, or both.  The more is taken, their levels of neurotransmitters rise to a level in which the brain is no longer in need of an external stimuli.  This allows for the person to function as a normal person.

That's basically it. Since I was very little (back when it didn't matter if I talked to myself because all little kids do it) I have been talking to myself.   

For a long time I didn't realize that people could actually hear me. (I couldn't tell how loud I was being) and It has caused me to hurt people. Because I was telling myself how I was angry or whatever and they heard it... though I only said it in anger to myself. 

  I try very hard not to do it in public but sometimes It just comes out. I try very hard to make sure my mouth isn't moving too much (then they can only tell if they hear me) Also I try not to say anything too mean or disgusting. (once someone heard me say ""penis"" [I'm a girl]  then because My house was near theirs we were both going the same way and I couldn't get away.) 

I have learned to be OK with this, that some people know I do it and that all of them think it's weird. But for me it's just part of me.  Though when around people like family and friends or at work, it goes to a more ""normal"" amount and isn't a constant conversation with myself.

For me the weird part is this. For some reason back when I was little I would play pretend

 I say ""us"" and ""we"" to actual people (whether I actually mean just me or not) because that is what I am used to saying. It confuses and most likely annoys most everyone. 

I am curious if other people with ADHD do this as well

1367780658.0,1dqtdo,Unexpectedly amazing self-help book: David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD),hlazlo,60,11,24,"Hi! 

While I'm normally of the school of thought around medication for ADHD
  
It's the perfect productivity system for people struggling with ADHD.  
  
I don't mean to trivialize it with a bland summary
  
The basic premise is:  
1.  Have an idea/thought/whatever.  
2.  Capture the thought on something (no matter how trivial it may seem).  This is the inbox.  
3.  Process the inbox.  
4.  Act on the ideas.    
  
The processing part is where it becomes magical for ADHD.  Thoughts (referred to as ""actions"") are assigned contexts and projects.  A project is a multi-action thing.  A context is where an action or project may be localized.  There's a lot more to it
  
Here's an example of how this works:  
  
I start thinking about washing my clothes.  Rather than assume I'll remember later, iPhone, whatever).  I'll need quarters do the laundry.  Capture it. I need to sort the clothes.  Capture it.  I need to buy some detergent.  Capture it.  In addition to the laundry, I start wondering about my cat.  She's running low on food and I really should get her more.  Normally, it's not just laundry and cat we're thinking about.  Pretend that there's also a hundred other ideas zipping by.  To be honest, under normal circumstances I'm going to fail at much of this.  Either my laundry will remain unwashed or my cat may be hungry until tomorrow because I forgot to one or the other.  Too many details!  
  
Let's look at how this gets handled...  
  
**Inbox:**  
1.  Wash clothes  
2.  Get a roll of quarters  
3.  Sort clothes  
4.  Buy detergent  
5.  Buy cat food  
6.  Feed cat  
  
**Assign some contexts...**  
Wash clothes (@Home)  
Get a roll of quarters (@Errand)  
Sort clothes (@Home)  
Buy detergent (@Errand)  
Buy cat food (@Errand)  
Feed cat (@Home)  
  
Let's create projects and assign the actions in order...  
  
**Project:  Do Laundry**  
1.  Sort clothes (@Home)  
2.  Get quarters (@Errand)  
3.  Get detergent (@Errand)  
4.  Wash clothes (@Home)  
  
**Project:  Cat Not Die**  
1.  Buy cat food (@Errand)  
2.  Feed cat (@Home)  
  
Okay, I'll check my @Errand context.  
  
**@Errand:**      
1.  Get quarters  
2.  Get detergent  
3.  Buy cat food  
  
Ah!  So now I have a list of things I *can* accomplish right now!  They are seemingly independent of each other (cat food and detergent have nothing in common) but I'm still going to get my multiple goals settled!  So
  
**@Home**  
1.  Sort clothes  
2.  Wash clothes  
3.  Feed cat  
  
So, and feed the cat.  Suddenly (without realizing), I've completed my Laundry project and my Cat Not Die project.  They had nothing to do with each other except that they had tasks that could both be accomplished in the same contexts.  As I cross over my actions after doing them, suddenly all of my projects are done!  I'm just skimming the surface of this (there are tons of other ways to create this workflow inside GTS.  Action priorities.  Due date.  Time/effort needed to accomplish things.  Sequential versus Parallel projects.  There's a lot to this, but I just wanted to give everyone a brief overview.  
  
I've just been using it for the past couple of days and I feel so relieved.  One problem that my Adderall cannot fix is the feeling that I'm dropping the ball on something, but a lifetime of ADHD has create a constant feeling that I'm forgetting things.  I feel so much more confident that I'm not letting things slip through the cracks.  It just seems to me that this productivity system, while not designed for us, seems to easily fit for the ADHD mindset.  We are already thinking about a hundred unrelated things when trying to accomplish one.  This system ties these unrelated things to each other in unexpected ways.  Keep in mind, though, that I'm doing this in addition to taking my medication.  
  
There are a lot of ""systems"" that work with this.  Some people prefer paper and pen.  Others use technology for this.  I use an app called OmniFocus on my iPhone.  It was designed specifically for the GTD system

I appreciate:

* The level of scrutiny that I commit to nearly every thought. The thoughts may be irrelevant, but I never get bored of completely dissecting a thought and taking from it what I think will be useful later.

* The fact that having ADHD has made me a very creative thinker. I can almost effortlessly come up with different solutions to problems that no one else considered before

* My initial level of interest in a new topic or hobby is so high that I'm able to consume a large amount of information about it and retain a good amount of the important parts. Of course

* My ability to accurately read peoples' emotions and correctly assume their reaction to something. ADHD allowed me to acquire this ability as a result of the constant thought-dissection

* And many others...

I don't appreciate all the symptoms that I'm sure we're all very familiar with. They can destroy my day, my self-esteem never stood a chance, I'm insecure about things most people don't care about, and it seems I will always be in a constant struggle with my own mind.

1372283862.0,1h4yds,I go between feeling like a complete fucking mess and feeling like I'm finally on the path to getting my life back in order. It feels like medication never helps.,pan0phobik,59,8,40,"I guess the purpose of this post is two-fold: **Is it possible to conquer ADD without medication?** And the other being that I'm trying to sort out **if my issues are mostly the result of ADD or if I'm just a lazy sack of shit**. I of course know laziness comes in to play

 I feel like it's never truly helped my ADD symptoms. Apologies for the wall of text... but I feel like this is the first community that I can relate to when it comes to some sort of understanding of why I can never get my shit together 100% 

I have experienced **two** benefits. The feeling of wanting to get shit done the first few hours of the first few days I start taking my medication and weight loss. I've lost up to 50 lbs on adderall EASILY when working out and following some dieting.

After the first few days, 5, 6, 7+ times to get them to sink in at all and even then I feel sketchy.

* I feel like I'm chasing a dragon that I've only gotten a couple grasps of and never even fully experienced and in this chase I'm starting to get bad side effects that I don't enjoy. When I was on various forms of Adderall I was having trouble eating normally. The thought of eating was almost sickening at times. I would drink water and eat just enough to not feel like I was completely empty and then when the medication wore off I'd eat like a pig and feel like shit about it.

I've just finished my first bottle of vyvanse and it felt great at first but now I never want it again. The last week or two of it I started experiencing strong mood swings. One negative memory/thought would drag me into a downward spiral of just focusing on everything negative about my life and everything I hate about myself.

* It seems like the biggest strides I've taken to improve my life (outside of my experience of losing 50 lbs

**Right now I'm on the upswing of my pendulum of life progression.** 

* I am back to training Martial Arts at least once a week. I SHOULD be going at least 2-3 but once a week is a lot better than not at all. This is very important to me because I feel like the positivity of my success in martial arts radiates exponentially to other parts of my life. After I do a good hour and a half class

* I am also finally back on track with school. Ever since I realized that my Game Art &amp; Design major was not the right path for me

I am glad I have these things going for me but I want to be doing so much more. I have a lot of goals but I am terrified that I won't be able to achieve them all. I feel like I can't stay focused on any one thing long enough to fully see it through (Hence my being one belt away from black belt for over 10 years now). I get crazy motivation for something for a short period of time and then it fades in and out. Despite me consciously knowing how important it is and how much I truly care about it. I KNOW my life is nothing without martial arts. I would feel completely awful if I was without it and I want to go as far as possible

**A couple facts that might be throwing wrenches into medication not working for me** -

* I have hypothyroidism - I have read that this carries symptoms of ADD

* When I don't have steady employment, which could be my issue with medication but I am very much a night person. Without a good paying job to keep me waking up at 8-9AM each day, it is pretty much inevitable that I will eventually devolve into staying up until 3-5AM and waking up at 10AM-1PM each day.

**tl;dr** **I want to manage my ADD without medication because I don't feel it has ever truly worked even when all conditions are prime for it to work (Good sleep schedule, but I want to be doing better. I don't know how to do it. I am confident that I won't be shaken from this path because I am having a lot more success than I've had in many years, but I'm still scared.

I somehow managed to get my B.A. (barely passing) and am now in my first masters year (2 years for a masters degree). Up until now, and have failed my first semester. I've had failing grades at school for as long as I can remember. Also, I can barely math.

I discovered this subreddit by a comment that was bestof'ed and realise a lot of the symptoms apply to me (including further research): 

I space out a lot, **forget things A LOT** (like exiting the house only to return and exit five more times because I kept forgetting to take something), am slower than others in understanding instructions and need people to repeat themselves (**the sounds are there I just don't know what you're saying!**), and can't organise anything for the life of me. Also, it would seem I'm always the last to know what's going on (events, info the teachers gave...), and **I'm perpetually late to anything** no matter what.

Just recently I had an exam and I'm like okay, what's for dinner, should I write that story, that new series is out--**fuck, fuck, fuck! Concentrate!** My mind doesn't wonder so much about unrelated zillion bits of random info, just everything and anything that relates back to me or my interests.

Another quirk I have is that my friends say that I don't seem to have much of an opinion on anything until I suddenly latch on to something that interests me, social interaction with strangers...)

Sometimes I will stop mid-sentence as I forgot what I was talking about. This will become very crippling if I am to become a teacher (what my degree is for).

I've talked about it to my general practitioner, or something invented by Americans who are always quick to medicate every little thing. So my question is: if you live in a country where adult ADHD is a controversial notion and still managed to get treatment, **how did you get your psychiatrist to entertain looking for ADHD?** Instead of believing you picked up some imaginary illness you read about on the internet.

I've probably been ADhD (lower case h) for years, after being incorrectly diagnosed with Bipolar disorder (influenced by my mother, but that's another story). In late college, after years of being called ""King Procrastinor"" by my mother, I was prescribed Vyvanse. It was like God himself in pill form. Everything seemed so much more interesting. My schoolwork would get done more quickly and efficiently than ever before, to my own surprise and delight. Together with my roommate (who had his own Adderall XR prescription), we would have ""wired days"" where we took our pills together and were just profoundly productive, if you knew us)

Fast forward a few years, anxiety, and avoidance. In college, my to-do list was dominated by things I ""had to do,"" and thus had no problem prioritizing and attacking, one by one. My to-do list now is mainly things I ""want to do,"" and ironically, but I might as well just randomly throw them together. Everything, suddenly seem like the most important, or at that exact moment

Accordingly, having an ""episode"" over trying to figure out what can be done, what should be done first, what's the best thing to do, etc. Obviously, in this state, NOTHING gets done. I keep worrying that if I do one thing, and what if that other thing is the thing I need to be doing to feel most productive and to make my life better

This phenomenon is most notable when I try to write. I'm told I'm a good writer. Writing is, and my long-term goal/dream is to be a published author. The problem? First, as above, I'm wracked with indecision in writing. I have what some call ""morgue files"" on my laptop and in notebooks. I have hundreds, maybe thousands, of pieces of dialogue, description, character traits, thoughts, or to create plot ideas
(And that's to say nothing of my perfectionism. No matter how much I tell myself it's unreasonable, like I need every possible inspiration, resource, idea, prompt, etc. before I begin to work. This is basically why I've wasted entire days searching for ""inspiration"" on StumbleUpon and the like).

This topic is aimed at people who DON'T want to give away their meds but may be pressured into it.  I didn't think that needed explaining.  If you choose to share your meds with your friends that's your own business but you don't need to post here advocating it.  That's a dick move.)**

I keep seeing this coming up in comments and I'm sure there have been topics dedicated to it in the past (I wish reddit allowed you to bump topics
  
I assume if someone's asking for your meds that you're either in school/college/uni or you hang around with a lot of drug users.  No reasonable and responsible adult would ask someone else for their medication.  
  

I only started on meds this year (I'm 33) but if I'd been taking them 10-15 years ago I might have had friends who asked for some and I might've either given them away gladly or at least felt awkward about saying no.  In fact I do know one guy who I'm certain will ask for some if I ever tell him I'm on them.  As someone who doesn't like confrontation of any kind I'm not looking forward to that conversation.  
  
  


  
But if that conversation happens

Those of you who are younger, or let you have that video game you wanted or favour you needed.  You giving in and saying ok, but only a couple.  Them telling your other friends and everybody hinting at you that they want some.  You wishing you never told anyone about the meds to begin with.  

Cut out all that bullshit before it begins.  If someone, just once, with ""I said no"".  Then walk out of the room or change the subject or whatever you need to do to signal that the conversation is over.   

Never apologise.  Never explain.   

If you go into even the slightest dialogue with them
  
  
It's possible you could lose this person as a friend.  That's a bonus.  Sometimes, they saved you from that awkward process of gradually disassociating yourself from someone.  
  
**edit:**  Some below have mentioned the illegality factor.  The problem is that selling/sharing medication is a crime that doesn't feel like a crime.  Impulsiveness and lack of foresight can basically drive a tank over those kinds of risks.  From my own experiences I find that in certain situations where you know something is wrong but have to remember a multitude of factors when faced with a decision, I just shut it down the moment I begin considering it (which is most times I pass a Bookies with cash in my pocket).  

My point, so just blacklist them in your mind and in the future trust yourself that you blacklisted them for good reasons, even if you can't recall all of those reasons in the moment between the suggestion of an action and the execution of that action.  You can start that list with:  Hard drugs.  Unprotected sex.  Gambling.  Spending money on a hobby you only took an interest in within the last 24 hours.

After much digging I figured out I needed to talk to the [Office of Controlled Substances](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/contact/dhp-mps/hecs-dgsesc/ocs-bsc-eng.php).  I called their general contact number 613-952-2177.  This was after calling boarder patrol

The gentleman I spoke with was very helpful and said as long as I brought 30 days or less worth of medication, there should not be a problem.  He also gave me his contact information and told me to call him if I have any problems.  He also emailed me and provided a [direct link to the medication guidelines](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hc-ps/substancontrol/pol/pol-docs/travellers-voyageurs-eng.php).

**TL;DR** 

 * **You** guys **rock**.
 * **Some of these titles and threads don't inspire much discussion**.
 * What do you think about the **weekly threads** 

***
##We're growing!
The title says **2600**

We're growing, it's always a good idea to **keep a pulse on everyone's wants and expectations** and the overall health of the community.  

This is one place where we can all do that!  Alternatively

***
##Thread Titles
I *was* gonna piggyback off of [computerpsych's comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/sw62b/dae_feel_awkward_in_social_situations/c4hkbmg) from another thread

A recent topic that has come up among the moderators

**Can the question be answered in one word?** If so

Personally

 1. &gt;DAE hear music in their heads while doing a boring task?
 2. Yes
 3. *scrolls down to next post*


*We want activity here!*  **We love it when people are here helping each other** out or just connecting with others due to what we have in common!  

It's just that these **DAE-styled titles** **don't seem to be working as well** as some others.  There's no thought involved in answering *yes* or *no*.  

#Similarly

 * Just started [medication]
 * I'm just got diagnosed
 * I think I might be ADHD..

We like new people

Example:
 * Is medication my only option
 * I'm scared about telling [person of authority] so that I can get tested.  What kind of tricks or tips do you guys have to overcome this?

I hesitate to do this, but I might be able to do a few here or there just to exercise my wordular gland.

We have a **nifty [FAQ](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/ADHD)** that should be able to **point most people in a solid direction.**  Yes

I hope the examples below can help to spur some literary creativity.

***

###These were just a few that were pointed out that I decided to take a crack at.  No disrespect is meant to the original author.  We are not singling anyone out.

##Wording Changes
&gt;Made myself lunch

**I'm having a hard time eating while on my medication.  What tricks do you guys use to make sure you keep eating?**

 1. Anyone have experience with Vyvanse?

   * I have a few questions for those of you with experience with Vyvanse

   * And then the self text has a list of specific questions (like

 1. Would you be upset if your doctor was not telling you the truth?
   * I feel like my doctor isn't telling me the truth about my medication
 2. Does anyone else not have any ADHD support groups? Are they even useful?
   * To those of you who go to ADHD support groups
 3. DAE
   * I find myself having a hard time explaining things to people.  Does anyone have any ideas or tactics to work on this?

OK

 * [I've been on Strattera for ten days. Pleasantly surprised!](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/svgdc/ive_been_on_strattera_for_ten_days_pleasantly/)

I like this a lot!  **I love reading success stories!**  *Share them!*  Seeing you succeed reaffirms that I can succeed.

##Idea: Weekly Q&amp;A Thread
Another option we have would be to have a weekly question and answer thread.  

**You ask questions**

**We've got a fair amount of weekly threads** at the moment (To Accomplish Tuesday, Start it Sunday (is that one, or am I just imagining things?)).  **How do you guys feel about those?**  

I am a huge fan of the To Accomplish and Win threads.  And I do like the idea of the Folly thread

They started out with fantastic participation, since they are great ideas and have seemed to do quite a bit of good for many people.
***
##We are a community of understanding and support
**This community is pretty darn fantastic.**  *Keep it up everyone!*  I just feel as if I should say the below anyway

**It never helps to be condescending or rude.**   Throughout our interactions in this subreddit, in their treatment.  

You or I may have already come to terms with the fact that we operate quite differently than non-ADHD people, scared.  Or upset.  Or even angry!  I don't blame them!  

**We're not asking you to be mind readers and fully understand someone's situation..**  It's just that some of us may have never experienced those emotions in this context

**Just be friendly in your interactions here.** :)
***
##We have a real time chatroom
You can join us extremely easily by using the [web chat link](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=/r/ADHD)!

If you're IRC savvy

**Conversation may be slow or dead at times.**  We have people from all over the world

**If you don't get an answer right away

**The chat and the subreddit are the same community.**  The same rules and guidelines apply.
***
##What concerns does the *community* have?
**Do you see anything around here you want to discuss?**

I do have a couple of targeted questions:

 * **What are your thoughts on the current visual style?**
 * **How do you feel about the weekly threads?**

***
##You guys freaking rock!
**Thank you guys!**  **I really enjoy this community!**  Honestly

So after I moved out on my own and went to college, I don't have someone to constantly push me to do work, so I've been struggling quite a bit in college, and decided to get help, because without it, I felt I would flunk out. 

I got tested, after saying ""I'm doing this, but understand it's much more honorable to conquer your problems without medication."" 

I started to feel guilty after this thinking I was making the wrong decision by taking meds. Still do.

And then I was also told by a mother of a few kids I babysit who also had ADD in college, they gave me paperwork for my doctor to fill out, and I dropped them off with my doctor.

I just got a call today from him saying that he refuses to fill out the forms

Problem is, and the disabled student services has a program to request extra credit from teachers to make up some lower scores due to ADD. So some of it is for earlier in the semester before I started the medication.

On top of that, rather than focusing on other things that I want to do.

First visit I'm told that the issue is major depression because (with extreme hand gestures) ""its written all over my face"". That and his demeanor (inconsiderate) and cancelling the second appt (my second cancellation by kaiser in four) led me to request another doctor. I mentioned his attitude as a reason for my request. In the end I stayed with a second visit to save time (I was into my fourth month without treatment!), and was greeted instantly with a ""so you complained about me, huh?"". Seriously? To a patient you think is heavily depressed? Sadly, it seems management has his back, as none of my complaints were addressed (I even payed the co-pay for the one minute visit).

I've been distracted--rotating from the dining room, to watching Star Trek: The Original Series, to crocheting, to cleaning...and now to Reddit. 


I'm frustrated and irritated and sad. I remember the way I felt as a child before my diagnosis and treatment. I remember how frustrated I was when I first started medication and how much better life became once they found the right medication and dosage. I've worked so hard to handle having ADHD all my life

I was diagnosed in fourth grade and now I'm 25. This is the first time since then that I've been unmedicated for so long (please don't yell at me, and screw people who don't think it exists.** I'm disappointed in myself today, but proud I've managed to get *something* done. 

I'm sorry for the wall of text; I know it's taboo in this thread. I'm on my phone. This subreddit has been an amazing support to me and I just want to say thank you. The reason I've managed to get anything done today is because of the advice I've read here.

It was 9AM and the available appointment was at 10. I ran to my supervisors office and asked and told her it was to treat my ADHD. She told me to run like the wind. I've had a very understanding boss. 

It was my first visit to a psychiatrist. He didn't hook me up to machines

Long story short he said I had severe ADHD. My acting career hid the symptoms as a child and I've just been coping at increasingly ineffective levels ever since. 

He put me on a very aggressive titration. Ritalin 10 twice a day for 5 days

My first dose was like waiting for Christmas. I had done it. I finally got help and this was what I had been waiting for. I became slightly light headed and extremely thirsty at work. I decided I should just go about my day and see what happens instead of waiting around and inducing a placebo effect. 

So i got to work. Aside from the light headedness I was wondering if it was even working. Then I realized I had just completed a task I had been putting of for a month. People came in my office to talk. I chatted

I read a chapter in my book for school. Held an online conversation simultaneously. Took a quiz over the chapter and made a 95. Insane. 

The next day I destroyed my to do list. Furthermore my phone had 75% battery at the end of the day. I hadn't looked at reddit once or anything else for that matter. 

In my personal life I listen better. I think before I speak and I stopped eating as much junk food. I drink half as many coke zeros as I did

Written by Vatsal G. Thakkar
From *The New York Times* Opinion page article dated April 28th

The author is a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the N.Y.U. School of Medicine. He describes several recent and long-term studies supporting the case for a positive correlation between ADHD diagnoses/ misdiagnoses and sleep disorders/deficiencies. In other words


For example: One study suggests that potential cause of ADHD may be from sleep-disordered breathing during infancy.  In fact,  the author  later goes on to describe how he personally had been first diagnosed with ADHD in college, and later found that he had an atypical form of Narcolepsy - One that produces a massive excess of REM/dream sleep (up to 40% of his total sleep time) and massive deficit of Delta/""Rejuvenating"" sleep (only a mere 5% of his total sleep time). 


I strongly suggest you all take a look at the article. Even if you cant find a personal connection to relate with it


**PERSONAL NOTE:** After reading the article, I was diagnosed with ADHD in college (just after my freshman semester, 2006). Even more amazing to me is that just last year *I too *was diagnosed with the *identical* form of narcolepsy as the author. Not only that, but as a newborn I had breathing issues and was placed in an incubator for the first 3 weeks of my life.  Having those pieces of my personal puzzle coming together like that was, well…It was a profound feeling to say the least! It was like looking at a mirror and seeing a NY Times article instead, lol. Now I guess I have real life example before me, but im pretty sure that just leaves me with even more questions.


**TL; DR** - The article discusses the overwhelming correlation between ADHD and Sleep Disorders. It suggests that ADHD itself (and ADHD symptoms) may actually be an indication

I'm a huge fan of podcasts right now; they've become one of the best ways I keep on news and learn new things! In addition to them being informative, Washing Dishes, Laundry, etc). 

**Here's how it works...**
When I know I have to do some chores but REALLY can't bring myself to do them I'll check my rss feeds, and I have to rewind the podcast a minute or two to catch back up. That's when the chore comes in, start doing the chore you don't want to do and if you're like me your capacity to focus on the podcast, and in turn your enjoyment of it, will be vastly improved; you'll also be doing something productive which should lead to less anxiety.
This obviously isn't perfect; you still have to have the presence of mind to think ""I should really be doing the dishes""
I also find that when I wear headphones I 'block' out a lot of people and it can seem very anti-social; it's very easy to forget that important people are around that would like some of your attention too... like say, which is always a huge bonus.

So give it a try, and give it a try next time those dishes are really starting to pile up, or that hamper is overflowing, or the litter box needs cleaning, or the lawn needs cutting, or the wife/spouse needs... anything?... well almost anything ;)

**TLDR; Listen to podcasts to help stop procrastination and get chores done!**

Welcome to the first ever mindful Monday. If people like this...I will continue it.

This will be a simple post each week. A thought

Metta is a meditation practice where one calms their mind and radiates love towards themselves, and an enemy.

I just finished sitting and practiced the following phrases towards all 7000 members of /r/ADHD:

*May you be happy.*

*May you be safe.*

*May you be healthy.*

*May your body and mind be at ease.*

*May you be focused.*

*May you love yourself completely. Without judgement.*

Repeat x5

*** 

&gt;By practicing Metta meditation, the chances to connect with all that is around and within us.... to live more fully. It allows a spaciousness to develop in the mind allowing us to be less reactive, less stressed out, more calm in the face of challenges, losses, injustices.

&gt;At the same time, separateness, hatred. We are moving away from the habits of anger and aversion, rage, despair, disappointment.

Source: http://www.bemindful.org/metta.htm

***

When I started **I was surprised to discover how hard it was to feel this love towards myself** (this is often the case). By practicing again and again

I suggest doing this via a guided meditation to help you remember the phrases (initially I forgot them often) and keep your mind on track.

Then, and because I was so depressed at the time, I numbly accepted going from daily dosages to nothing at all. Very abruptly.

I struggled so hard. The first few months were just a hazy fog of floating through life trying to make it through the day clinging onto one coherent thought at a time. It was like thrashing around in molasses just to be normal.

After a while I thought I had won. In fact

This last year

The anxiety is out of control and I can't afford therapy anymore. I'm on Ativan as needed for the times where I feel like the things I have to do are going to swallow me up and I can't handle it

I was diagnosed at about age 11 and was medicated for a time, and not make those stupid mistakes, whatever they may be. 

I was lazy, but for some reason I never could find the motivation or drive to do the things I needed to do. 

At the start of this past May I began working for my uncle for the third summer in a row. The work is hard and the hours suck. I used to have to listen to music to help move the time along. I would check the time, then check the time again only to find that it was 7:33. I would grumble and complain about everything, despite the fact that I was (and still am) making close to $400 a week after taxes. 

Since I've started this summer, everything has changed. I now only listen to music for the sake of enjoying it whilst I work and often times just go without. I find that waking up is immensely easier (I was never a coffee drinker so the fact that the drug is a stimulant which ensures I stay awake and alert is a convenient side effect), and the days now pass much faster and I am just so incredibly much more focused on my tasks and hardly ever bother to check the time.

* **Soak in the positive events in your life**

 * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer

I was accepted out of my middle school with an almost full ride scholarship due to my grades and to my standardized testing scores, unfortunately for me, she would always keep me on track

That all changed when I moved schools, I played tons of sports and lived a generally exciting and full life. My RA and my House advisor though were always annoyed with me, having to tell me to study frequently bothered them. But the structure of the school did not permit the ability to slack off during my frehsman year. Unfortunately, things changed. 

My sophomore year was a mess, ""Your child is briliant but he has difficulty paying attention in class, etc. etc."" But now they were forced to admit that the grades I was receiving were substandard. Then, one day, things changed. This girl I was dating at the time had a father who was a Psychologist. He was a nice man, kind to everyone he came across, but he was having trouble in his practice. One of the tests they were using to screen for mental disorders were producing an abnormally high instance rate, so I did. 

The next week, I called mom and dad, who are both professionals and they agreed to fill out the forms me. I gave my girlfriend's father their number and he called them. I do not know the full details about what happened but the gist is that he told them about my results and asked for them to fill out a Conner's 3 test alongside giving him permission to have my teacher's fill out a set as well. 

The results came back about two weeks after I had officially filled out my tests, he knew that I was able to read and understand the charts that he showed me and I learned that I have ADD or ADHD. (98th percentile on average for all three categories.) I was perscribed my medication and sent on my way.

Then my life changed at the point, I'll even underline and annotate it for you as well, teach. Gradually my grades began to improve but there was still no hope of slvaging my sophomore year. 

This year though, crisp image. I honestly can say for the first time in a long while that I am excited to go to school, excited to do my homework, and, I am excited to learn about things that do not make me jump for joy.

**How to Start Studying**

This is my personal tried and tested process for a successful session of studying

	1. Wait until night time (or go somewhere with no/little distractions)
	2. Put in ear plugs
	3. Turn off all computers/electronic devices
	4. Take ADHD medication (have something to eat before/during)
	5. Clear working area of all distractions (empty desk) &amp; get out stationary
	6. Lower temperature of the room so it isn't too hot (more on the cold side)
	7. Get out study materials/books/documents and place them on desk
	8. Write all the things/thoughts that need doing on Wunderlist (or notepad app)
	9. Sit down

Hope you guys find this useful in some way.

edit: 

I should also add that if I take any breaks to go to the bathroom/get food/water etc

Also, I actually mean non-work things which are on my mind that may tempt me to run off and do before 'starting' to study. I find it helps clear my mind and lets me focus on what's in front of me.

For example: Watch the great gatsby, enrol in a ballet/hip hop class, buy ""____"" from amazon, call this person, do tax returns etc.

1371414567.0,1gh0wj,Are short term memory problems associated with ADHD?,raquel101,45,3,76,"**Background:**

I am 20 years old and last week my psychiatrist diagnosed me with ""moderate ADHD"". Only recently have I been having bad ADHD symptoms so I didn't think it was ADHD. But we discussed family members and my childhood habits and such as well as taking one of those personality tests and he thinks it's definitely ADHD. I was prescribed Adderall and so far I've only taken it for 3 days. Two days on 10mg and one on 20mg. I feel a little more focused but no change in memory.



**Problem:**

So the attention and focus symptoms suck but it's somewhat tolerable. The major problem I am having is my short term memory has gone to shit. This is apparent in my new food service job where people spew out a large order and it takes a while to type it into the register. I forget the second half and ask them to repeat it. I type more stuff in the register and STILL can't remember like the last item they ordered. I have to ask again. Needless to say the customers get very angry and share a few choice words. Then the kitchen people ask me to clarify the order I just punched in and I can't even remember what the customer said, looking them in the eye and doing my best to listen. I'm not distracted by anything. I am pretty comfortable with the register even though it's confusing, I don't get too stressed about punching stuff in.

**Questions:**

* My question is

* If it is ADHD does the medicine help treat memory problems?

* Any other advice is much appreciated

Results: Documentation from the doctor stating the process of tests done, co-workers, or colleagues. I keep my diagnosis to myself and share with a select few because those that don't have ADHD may have a hard time understanding.

I've always thought I grew up with social anxiety. I've been using that excuse forever when I'm in new social situations, but ADHD. I'm predominantly inattentive, and knew to wrap up her stories and talk about something else.

I had a moment a few days ago where this became more obvious. I met a new person at work. He seemed really interesting and I was laughing and carrying on with him almost immediately. I was medicated that morning and I was carrying on a great conversation. Fast forward to lunch time when I need to take my second dose and I realize I forgot my meds. Our conversations from that point onward were short and uninteresting. My responses were ""mhmm"", and I couldn't look him in the face and looked for any way to do something else. It was like a night and day difference. I wonder now just how much of my past, shitty social life was from being nervous around people, or if I was ""anxious"" as a way of dealing with an inability to effectively communicate. 

It's just crazy to identify as a certain type of person, so I followed up with them on how I could have made the interview go better. They said I was one of the top candidates but seemed less confident, not as interested in the job as some of the others, and quite fidgety. I wasn't medicated at the time. Now knowing all of this, I understand that my confidence is effected because I KNOW I have a hard time speaking effectively (not because I'm afraid to talk to them), which I'm sure made me seem uninterested and more anxious.

* Give people **new to the  /r/ADHD community (and there are thousands of you)** a chance to say hello and share a bit about their strengths
* Reduce the amount of threads asking a simple question in /r/ADHD

***  
**This is the place for questions like:**

* How do I force myself to eat despite a depressed appetite?  
* What was your experience on [medication]?  
* I took Adderall for the first time yesterday
* Did you tell your friends
* Do you feel like your ADHD makes you special?  
* How do I talk to [doctor
* What smells like red?  

**We will attempt to answer every question in this thread (within a week). Hopefully others will help us out...but we won’t leave you hangin'!**

***  
Another method of communicating is to [](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=/r/ADHD).

***

## The idea is to consolidate all of these kinds of questions into a single place that is more easily searched.  As we migrate from my temporary wiki to the new reddit wiki

### **Remember:  You should still have your planner and your watch!**  *Work on the habits for a week

* **[Week 2](http://redd.it/176cje)**
* **[Week 1](http://redd.it/16s6pj)**

***
#### *Tip:*  “Touch it once.”  If you pick it up
* Sort the mail when you get it (on the stairs or in the elevator
* Waiting two minutes for something to heat in the microwave?  Work on dishes or clean the kitchen.  
* Getting up from your seat?  Take your dishes to the kitchen *and put them in the dishwasher (or soak them)*.

***

# **The second session addressed “time management” and setting up rewards.**

##### I. Plan to give yourself a reward after completing a task or part of a task that is difficult or unpleasant.  
# *Examples:*
* Take a walk.
* Call a friend.
* Listen to music.
* Watch **one** show on TV.
* Surf the web.
* Read a book or magazine.
* Fix a snack.
* Exercise.
* Take a bath.
* A ‘more liked’ task.

##### II.  Use naturally occurring reinforcers.
If you prefer talking to people over writing memos

##### III.  Pair aversive tasks with pleasurable ones.
# *Examples:*
* Exercise while watching TV
* Curl up in a comfortable chair to read a business document.
* Clean house to your favorite energetic music.
* Wipe counters or load the dishwasher while talking to a friend on the phone.
* Otherwise simplify a difficult task -- use online bill-pay or use TurboTax for your taxes.

##### IV. Partner with someone to do the task.
* Work on the task with with someone you live with--wash windows together.
* Work on complementary tasks with someone--two tasks in the same room
* Set up study dates with friends to work on your separate subjects next to each other.

Imaging a normal brain is like a giant shipping and receiving warehouse

Now, lacking opposable thumbs, cannot move packages quickly and they are indifferent, so they don't care where things go, or even if the package has proper postage, or if it is even a package at all.  It could be someones shoe that was left in the wrong place or a flickering light in the corner of your eye or ""hey, I didn't notice that bit of dirt on the corner of this paper I've been looking at for the last hour."" When these random bits come in they throw off the already poor system because the cats get confused as to what to do with them since they tend to wobble on the shelves and are, more interesting than the packages.  On top of that the pile of other packages is growing bigger and bigger and the cats that aren't looking at the different wobbly object can't keep up.  The only way to correct this is to stop taking in packages for a little while and let the bottle neck that was caused get sorted.

Sometimes these cats start getting packages they really like to sort out.  For some odd reason these packages are really easy to sort.  So easy that all they want to do is sort these specific packages and ignore all the others.  The others get dropped off at the front door because all the other mail slots for different packages are closed because the cats aren't interested.  Sometimes the mailman knocks really loudly

In a warehouse such as this things are easily lost, and pushed back on the shelves to make room for other things that don't necessarily go there but seem to fit and the other thing wasn't wobbling much any more so it must not be important.  When something is needed to be found, it's much harder to locate, being that the cats don't have a complex vocabulary and tend to find other things that wobble or twitch or stand out more, but since all the cats are looking it gets found and used properly.

I can continue the analogy with teaming the cats up with well trained dogs (meds) but this is getting long and I need to be up early

Tl;dr I relate what adhd is like by comparing a well organized shipping warehouse to one that is staffed by cats.

If you read down the symptoms of ADHD, distraction, avoiding projects, can't finish projects, changing plans... the perfect storm of incompetence. I have a few tricks that help me out, but it's still a pain in the ass.

1) Take notes. Never rely on your memory.

I lost my first project manager job because I would show up to meetings without a note pad, when called upon for input, I wouldn't know heads or tails of anything because my mind was blank. Afterwards, I couldn't remember what happened at the meeting because it was boring. I eventually wised up and started taking meticulous notes, but I had already lost the confidence of my superiors.

2) Use Evernote for more than just notes.

Besides organizing your thoughts and projects

3) Wear many hats.

I may be a project manager by title, I am much more to the company than just a crank turner. I do tech support. I solve programming problems. I strategize business tactics. I write articles for the company blog. This diversification of activities makes the boring parts easier to bear, knowing that something interesting is waiting right around the corner.

4) Own your projects.

Most companies just want their project managers to be freelance shepherds. I suffered from an acute lack of giving a shit about those projects. At my current job

I just want to add that I refuse to take medication. It changed my personality too much. I used to take it... all the way up to my sophomore year of high school. I went off it and my grades plummeted. I dropped out of HS after the first semester of my senior year. But I became a much more interesting person,False,self,t5_2qnwb,1365730789.0,,,t3_1c6eii

Each time he suggested an appt date and time it sounded like he was guessing.

It's funny because I have a really good memory when I can filter the crap and access it. And this anger is crystallizing my memory and now I can recall with clarity our entire conversation. How much more clear can I be than repeating the day and time and saying ""Valentine's Day?"" to make sure I have it right.

I've been diagnosed with ADHD since I was in elementary school, then, do we draw the line for ADHD?

At what point does ADHD stop being a case of laziness and discipline and start being a disorder? Is it a disorder when your actions make you unhappy and harm your life? Does that make any of the weaknesses that we succumb to as humans a disorder? To create a broad definition of disorder is to remove the ability to make mistakes. Nothing is a mistake; why would we do it if we knew it would harm us? Yet I think we can all agree that mistakes are a part of life and not a malfunction of the brain.

One of the symptoms that come along with ADHD is 'risky behaviour' - thrill seeking or being an adrenaline junkie. This is my risky behaviour, much harder not to buy a new cell phone then it is to go to the bar and only drink coke.**

The only side effect I'm experiencing is a substantial decrease in appetite. As a compulsive over eater for decades this is welcomed. Keep in mind I'm 44 and weigh 340 pounds.

What I want to share today are the differences in my life before and after the medication after just a few days on the medication.

The biggest difference I notice is that I can concentrate for long periods of time on work

Highly stimulating activities for me were things I was interested in and obsesses over it for weeks until I lost interest or will power. I won't bore you with a long list of things I've been ""into"" and a few weeks later quit. It's enough to say that my original diagnosis was Bipolar Type 2. After obsessing over the activity I'd fall into minor depression for a few days and then I'd be just damn grumpy until I found another activity to keep my interest.

Prior to Vyvanse, nothing bad really happened if I was late mowing the lawn.

Medicated I simply sit down and start working and can do so for hours at a time. My mind is clear and less affected by distractions. I need to manage distractions as a normal person would of course. It's hard for anyone to concentrate with sirens wailing

I can also multitask more efficiently. I'm on conference calls regularly (as I am now while typing this). Prior to meds when listening to a call and writing reports or analyses I would physically stop and find my self lost not knowing what I had just been doing seconds before. Was I listening to the call? Was I writing? My mind could not keep two activities in play at the same time. Medicated this is not a problem at all.

One last observation the I find amazing is that I'm no longer irritable

I hope this is helpful. I'll write another post in a few weeks.",self,t5_2qnwb,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/11yawe/adult_adhd_before_after_vyvanse_perspective/

1342835505.0,wwlao,To those of you using the Pomodoro Technique (and not getting as much as you thought out of it),TheWobble,43,4,12,"For starters, followed by 5 minutes of relaxation.

This technique helped me a lot...at first. But I soon noticed that the 5 minute breaks were sapping my concentration so severely that it felt like I was starting from scratch every time the 25 minute work cycle rolled around. 

If you're like me and find this happening more often than you'd like, I would be on 3 different Reddit pages and compulsively reloading my email. I was trying to bottle all the things that distracted me into that 5 minute break, then expect to magically refocus once time was up. It didn't work very well.

The game-changer was when I finally abandoned the notion that I could have it all (Liz Lemon style) and instead started using that 5 minutes to further sharpen my focus (Jack Donaghy style). Rather than flip through links and wall posts for 5 minutes

Go ahead and try it. Next Pomodoro break, and give your brain time to cool down. No internal monologue, no daydreaming, just...relax. The time will fly by, and once the 5 minutes are up, you'll find starting work again to be far easier. To use a running analogy - it's the mental equivalent of spending 5 minutes slowing down and catching your breath between laps, while mindless surfing with those minutes is like suddenly stopping on the track to do jumping jacks.

Good luck!

So, herbs, whatever, that can replace my Adderall, or at the very least help me retain my focus and concentration..? Finals are coming up real soon, and I've gotten good grades for the first time in the 2+ years I've been in college, would hate to fall back into my failing habits on the finals..

1364067526.0,1avh3r,Just Diagnosed with ADD at 39.,evilcheese,44,8,21,"Just this week I finally took the step to get help.  Dealing my my daughters ADHD issues made me look at myself more critically   

They diagnosed me with ADD and Depression.  I am currently trying Vyvanse 30mg and Celexa 20mg.  I have been on the medication 4 days now and wow.  I can feel a difference already.

The first day I felt like a bow pulled back ready to release and had a sense of euphoria.  The first night I fell asleep at 11:30 and woke up at 3:30 AM. 

Here it is 4 days later and I don't have the euphoria but I do find it easier to do tasks that I would usually ignore or put off

My wife was concerned about the euphoria and me getting motivation to do things that normally I would put off or complain about doing.  She is concerned that I may be a little manic.  I explained to her that for once I feel not normal but like I can do what I put my mind to now.  Where as before I just got frustrated or just didn't try.

I have high hopes that this will help me in my professional life as well as I was finding it difficult to study for my certifications. 

Funny I put off my health until I saw my daughter fighting the same issues I had in school.  It's like looking in a mirror.

*Just wanted to remind people to **upvote this post**. Recently

#####Science behind Win Wednesday (new)

* Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect
  * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting

* By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field. 
  * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve

* **Soak in the positive events in your life**
  * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer

*I have much more information on the neuroscience of recognizing the good

Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!

###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***

* **Each and every one of us have victories every week

* **Whatever ""level"" you happen to be at

* **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won

***
* The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win

* **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views

1359041144.0,176xvj,I'm starting to suspect boyfriend has adult ADD. Relationship is suffering.,throwadd,38,3,28,"I have a wonderful boyfriend of seven months.  I'm in my 30s and he's in his 40s. He is divorced and has two kids, and 98% of the time I am very happy. 

I'd say that the two main things that we argue about are his dismissal of my concerns and his physical destructiveness.  (We have been talking about how I don't feel heard

The physical destructiveness is driving me insane and is the primary reason I find myself posting here.  This is very wordy

We spend most of the time at my place, and I don't have money to replace things that get broken.  I'm not talking about destruction of fancy electronics (that I don't have) or anything like that, I'm talking about basic things like railings, cupboards and counter tops.  

He isn't destructive or messy on purpose, he creates a huge mess and seems unaware that the counter ain't gonna clean itself.  Something he uncaps stays uncapped.  If he's rinsing something, there is going to be a flood on the counter top, because he can't limit his movements to keep the water in the very large sink.  If he takes something out of a drawer, it never makes it back into the drawer, despite my requests that he please put it back when he is done.  I am very tired of cleaning up after him and fixing the things that he breaks.

The first time we talked about how I wish he would start noticing his surroundings was when he was sitting in the passenger seat of my car holding a little potted plant of mine.  We went around a curve

Here's the straw that broke the camel's back - last night

He apologized for it and said he was sorry for being a bull in a china shop

I know that these sound like small issues, the more I get upset the more he justifies tuning me out because I'm ""uptight"".  He rolls his eyes at me and stops listening or attaching any importance to my words.  He seems to think that if whatever he's damaged or destroyed is not a problem for him, then it shouldn't be for me. 

His place is a disaster area.  There are piles everywhere.  Things are destroyed, overlooks the huge messes and is constantly accidentally breaking things will drive me bonkers.

The other things that I notice are:  

* He has **trouble sleeping**.  He wakes up in the middle of the night with his mind racing and it takes him a few hours to go back to sleep.  He says he has a biphasic sleep pattern and it's how people used to naturally sleep before electricity was invented.  Ha.  When he does sleep he constantly has vivid dreams or nightmares.  I often hear him say ""Oh

* He has **trouble following through** with tasks.  

* He **talks fast**

* He seems to have **trouble picking up on social cues**, we ran into some friends of his one night, and he missed every single cue they gave to wrap up the conversation.  He kept talking and talking and talking, and went off on tangents that I could see they were increasingly uninterested in.  He was talking at them, not talking to them.  The pace of his speaking kept increasing.  Everyone was uncomfortable, but he was so lost in talking a mile-a-minute about the best sandwich shop in a distant city that he didn't notice.  There were no pauses, and therefore there was no opportunity to catch his eye and gesture that we should go.  My solution was to wait until heads were turned, but he gave me strange look as if I were rudely interrupting a conversation in which everyone was engaged.  We didn't talk about it because I didn't want to hurt his feelings.

He's made a joke here or there about having ADD (""Maybe my son gets it from me"")

I just want to have a peaceful relationship where he knows that I appreciate him.  I hate feeling so critical toward him.  I realize I can try to not get annoyed at him when he breaks my things, the extra layer he adds on of ""this just being him"" and my ""being uptight"" feels even more disrespectful.  The more time we spend together, the more he destroys.  I get upset, and the more I times I get upset, the more he tunes me out. The arguing is increasing.  The hurt feelings are increasing.  I find myself researching terms like ""body awareness and ADD"" because I am trying to understand how to make this better.

First of all

If it does sound like ADD

TL;DR  *I think my boyfriend has ADD and it is causing us to argue frequently.  I am frustrated. How do I tell him my suspicions without hurting his feelings?*

### **The second session addressed “time blindness”.**

##### I. Intro.  

##### II.  Improving Time Awareness  
1. This will take practice^(3).  

2. Project how much time each task will take.  
3. Observe and record how much time each task actually took.  

##### III.  Always wear a watch and have a clock in view at all time.  

1. Test yourself -- without looking at your watch (or a clock)

##### IV. Always carry your planner with you.  

1. Find a planner

2. Keep your planner with you at all times.  
3. Enter appointments
4. Consult your planner thrice daily -- every morning

 * Plan each day the night before.  

 * Familiarize yourself with the plan and make any necessary changes in the morning *before* you start your day.  
 * Update your planner as needed midday.  
 * At least once per day

* **Set ‘cues’ for checking your planner, and when you’re getting ready for bed at night.**  

##### V.  Scheduling

# ***Short-term scheduling:***  

 * All appointments must be recorded.  

 * All tasks should be scheduled.
 * All tasks not completed must be moved to the next time period.

# ***Successful Scheduling Tips:***  

1. Schedule repeating tasks (weekend bill paying

2. People who work from home or study at home should observe regular business hours for school and work-related tasks.  Leave chores
3. Plan the most difficult/challenging tasks for when you’re most motivated
4. If you’re feeling energetic
5. If you’re tired
6. Never leave a task midway through a difficult or complex part -- it will take that much more effort to ‘start up’ again.  
7. Schedule oversized ‘time-blocks’ for things that require more mental ‘start-up’.  
8. Make use of “time cracks.”  Waiting in line for a ride?  Reply to an email on your smartphone.  Check and update your schedule.  Text your friend about getting together.  
9. If you fall off the horse
10. Be sure to schedule ‘relaxation time’.  

##### VI.  Using “Time cracks” -- those little bits of down time while you’re waiting.  

* Waiting a few minutes for the microwave to heat something?  Do some dishes

* Update/plan your schedule.  
* Write a check.  Address/stamp an envelope.  Pay a bill online with a smartphone.  
* Make a list.  
* Menu plan for the week
* Decide on weekend plans, etc.  
* Brainstorm paper or project ideas.  
* Listen to audiobooks.  
* In traffic?  Try to make words from the letters on license plates or ‘sightsee’ -- look at architecture
* Carry a book
* Mentally plan long-term.

After my second (and final) session

You guys are awesome. /r/adhd

So last week I found a new psychiatrist. Someone who specialized in adult ADHD. And it was amazing.

He didn't just read from a script. He didn't list DSM symptoms and ask me ""yes or no"". He asked about seemingly random things. My sleep patterns. Did I have hobbies? What kind of things interested me? How did I do in school? Were there times when I did better or worse?

And he gave me validation. He mentioned habits that were actually symptoms. Symptoms I've had my entire life

In short

So now, on a regular basis, for the first time is amazing. 

I wish I'd done this years ago.

*I suggest you read the whole post to be MORE successful

***

## Choose the participation method that works for you:

* **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish.  *(Ex. Set a doctors appointment

* **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week.  *(I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)*

* **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**

**Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*

***

By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community

By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, and you will feel like doing more.

***

## Suggested Guidelines

* **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!)

* **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time

* **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you).

* **Small start.** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you can make towards your goal.  *I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.*

***

## Tips

* Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, relevant, and time-bound**

* **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable.  Study 2 hours is.

* **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say

* **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.  Google calendar.  Agenda.  Write it down so you don't forget.  Our working memories are flaky....

* **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead.

* **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*

***

## Examples from previous weeks:

* Tidy room.

* Buy car.

* Go to work.

* Attend all my classes on time.

* Reschedule appointment.

* Mornings: brush teeth &amp; meditate.  Evenings: brush teeth

* Pay bills.

* Plan vacation.

* Go to the gym 3x this week.

* Break down chores by days so I can have 'a day off with my darling' before he leaves.

* **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.”

After a month I started to realize the situation I was in with my Fiance was bad. We were not meant to be together and I knew I should have admitted it to myself a long time ago. So I ended our 4.5yr relationship. We treated each other like shit. There was no support on either side. I played video games all the time and didn't help her and she yelled and screamed and never tried to help me. (that's just one part) My whole life changed from that point on. My anxiety practically went away. I started learning how to live a single life. I had no money when she moved out, an older friend and I were talking and she convinced me to try her Adderall 10mg.(I am very careful about prescription medications) I have never been able to complete my charting because I can't focus long enough to chart on 6 patients every 2 hours, but that day was different. I was able to focus and complete every task on time, get every bit of charting I needed to do done, and still feel calm and together. No jitterness or hyperness like I expected. Life changing. I scheduled an appointment the next week with my GP and told him about my experience with Adderall. He is a great GP and he told me its OK if I try someone's meds because it helps him know the right medication for me. He prescribed me Adderall 10 mg last Wednesday.

So my house stays clean and I don't feel the struggle to motivate myself. I see what needs to be done and I do it. Life is getting better. The only problem for me is the appetite suppression but now I just eat less. I am giving up alcohol and not smoking pot anymore. Just really enjoying the way my life has changed for the better.

Anyway

I didn't realize that I had ADHD until about a year ago and I am now in my 30's. Started taking Adderall 10mg XR and it helped a lot with my last semester of school (which took 10 years to complete, I get distracted by something else.

So in the interest of a fellow space cadet, 3) not fly off the handle at the smallest things, and 4) is that a butterfly?

For me what's worked so far is the medication combined with a forceful focusing on the situation at hand; so far I have mixed results with the latter. I notice that sitting on my hands will sometimes prevent me from blabbering non-stop and the other part is acknowledging when I actually don't know something, I had a huge motivational collapse which almost made things worse than they ever were. Now I spend most of my time running, which is a true god-/FSM-send.

So help! I am lucky enough not to suffer from a lack of self-worth and I'm fully confident in my abilities to do whatever the heck I decide to finally do...I just need to know how to actually get up and do the boring

*I suggest you read the whole post to be MORE successful

***
## Choose the participation method that works for you:
* **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish.  *(Ex. Set a doctors appointment
* **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week.  *(I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)*
* **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**

**Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*

***
By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community

By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, and you will feel like doing more.

***
## Suggested Guidelines
* **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!)
* **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time
* **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you).
* **Small start.** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you can make towards your goal.  *I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.*

***
## Tips
* Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, relevant, and time-bound**
* **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable.  Study 2 hours is.
* **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say
* **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.  Google calendar.  Agenda.  Write it down so you don't forget.  Our working memories are flaky....
* **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead.
* **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*

***
## Examples from previous weeks:
* Tidy room.
* Buy car.
* Go to work.
* Attend all my classes on time.
* Reschedule appointment.
* Mornings: brush teeth &amp; meditate.  Evenings: brush teeth
* Pay bills.
* Plan vacation.
* Go to the gym 3x this week.
* Break down chores by days so I can have 'a day off with my darling' before he leaves.
* **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.”

Cuneiform is really cool! Wait, AC just turned on. How does a thermostat work, though? Temperature-sensitive metal in a coil, maybe? It would have to be pretty darn sensitive. Maybe it's a mercury thermometer, and that applies pressure to a sensor? Or that bends a coil, which has a tension-sensing device attached? Mercury is dangerous though. Maybe that's just old thermostats. Wikipedia will know...

* Each room or section of a room should be organized so ***just the things needed most frequently are nearest.***  You may need to buy containers, and filing cabinets or folders for storing and labeling particular items or categories.  *This doesn’t mean you need to spend lots of money on it!*  Find items in thrift stores, discount-department stores, or clearance sales, or buy contact paper to cover shoe boxes, for example.

* For example
 1. Take care of personal finances (pay bills
 2. Read or write materials related to your job or school.  
 3. Pursue a hobby like photography, or sewing.  

##### II.  Creating ‘Zones’.  
The **top of your desk would have your computer** -- I do online bill pay and search for recipes and journal articles online.  I’m certainly not going to have a separate computer for each!  Placing it centrally allows it to be on the ‘edge’ of multiple zones

The **top desk drawer should hold ‘universal’ supplies**, scratch paper, a ruler, a stapler, a calculator, etc.  If your work surface is a table, these ‘office supplies’ could go in an organizing tray on your bookshelf or on top of your filing cabinet

You might **place a filing cabinet on one side of your desk** -- one drawer for finances and one drawer for job or school papers.  Or perhaps you **put a bookcase on the other side of your desk** and with dedicated *and labeled* file boxes on the shelves.  In this case

##### III.  Creating a Filing System.  
You can **use colored labels or file folders to group similar papers**:  

* I have grey for financial stuff --
 1. A single folder for all my filed tax forms (since I have simple forms).  Each year is stapled with the supporting documents
 2. Another folder holds my current and past leases.  
 3. A separate hanging folder holds a folder each for automobile and bicycle registrations
 4. My credit card and bank statements are all digital

Blue is academic stuff

##### IV.  In-Box(es) and Out-Box(es).  
I have multiple in-boxes and multiple out-boxes; this lets me do a ‘rough sort’ in seconds.  I use a stacked horizontal-box sorter for this

* **Action In-Box** for urgent items

* **Everyday In-Box** for paper scraps with websites, etc.  *(Take care of this weekly.)*  

* **To-Sort In-Box** if I’m in a hurry (while cleaning other rooms

* **Urgent Out-Box** for envelopes to be mailed, etc.  *(Take care of this daily.)*

* **To-File Out-Box** for papers that need to be filed -- I have ‘category’ file folders here for ‘Health


##### V. The Process.  
1. ***Divide the organizing project into parts.***  Don’t expect to organize your entire living room or garage all at once.  You can divide it into 30-minute periods and set a timer
2. ***Decide how many sessions you’ll need!***  A 16’x16’ garage will have 16 ‘sections’
 
3. ***Give yourself a well-earned reinforcer after each!***  Something as simple as “I get to file the emptiest To-File folder or work on the emptiest section, garden, go outside, etc.”  

4. If you feel tempted to stop before your ‘chunk’ is done

5. ***Use a system for rough-sorting: ‘DRAFTS.’***  
 * Donate.  
 * Recycle.  
 * Action.  
 * File.  
 * Trash.  
 * Shred.  

*If you can’t quickly decide, with multiple ‘File’ boxes, one each for ‘Household,’ ‘Health,’ ‘Finances,’ ‘Art ideas,’ and ‘Academics,” making the future filing pre-chunked!  

##### IV.  If possible
You can hire organizers, and a mail-action pile for you to focus on.  If they’re willing, they can also do the sweeping, dusting, washing shelves, labeling containers (at your direction), etc.

I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 9 years old and started taking meds when I was in 4th grade, embarrassed about taking pills for my ADHD.

There were a few days that I forgot to take my meds, which initially made me want to never stop taking them, and insecure about who I was with my ""normal"" brain. 

In high school, when my pills had worn off (at this point I was taking an 8-hour every morning, I stopped having to go to the school nurse in junior high). And I began to notice that the medicated me was a different person than the ""normal"" me. So I decided, in sophomore year, to stop taking medication.

Towards the end of junior high I discovered I had depression. In high school, I just failed to make my next appointment and never got around to doing it. 

Now let's jump to today. I'm about to go int my 4th year of college (which will not be last, bored shitless, knowing I have a ton of work to do, then I decide to get high and watch The West Wing instead of doing homework that isn't necessarily long or difficult. I'm not sure how to get my ass back into gear, and I don't want to take pills that would alter my personality.

A common problem for ADHD people is the multitude of people you will encounter, actually, it's quite damaging to a person with ADHD that has to deal with their own inner voice telling them they're inadequate for much of the same reason. Those people don't see that what they're saying has this effect, and I doubt they even can. Either way, that's not the problem.

Another caviat: I'm refering to **most** people when I speak about people without adhd in this post. Lots of non-adhd people can empathize with us

The problem is that people without ADHD often can't picture an existence where they aren't at the level of control that they currently are. They can't process countless afternoons where you get home

When you tell someone that you compulsively procrastinate, look nigga, if I could do my homework like everyone else, I would. It's not like I enjoy being so stressed out all the time or having shitty grades.

I mean, you might as well just work on it"" and I have to just give some noncommittal answer like ""I genuinely can't muster the willpower"" because explaining to that person again why it's so hard is just not worth it.

Even if I could muster the willpower to not procrastinate, unless the reality of the situation is apparent to me (which tends to be very very late). When an ADHD person tells someone that as an explanation, it just seems as if it goes in one ear and out the other. They just can't process this.

Telling many ADHD people to ""just focus"" or ""just work"" or ""just chug through"" is like telling a severely autistic person to stop making weird noises or to stop acting so fucking strange. It's just not in the hardwiring. Maybe that comparison isn't exactly 1:1

My pdoc brought up a very important point: she said that, but also makes me feel panicky -- so she said that stimulants are more or less out of the question because they're ""like drinking ten cups of coffee"" (her words). 

She brought up Wellbutrin as the only other serious option (which I really don't want to do -- I want to get pregnant within the year and I don't want to necessary start up something that I'll have to withdraw from in a few months).

#####Science behind Win Wednesday (new)

* Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect
  * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting

* By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field. 
  * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve

* **Soak in the positive events in your life**
  * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer

Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!

###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***

* **Each and every one of us have victories every week

* **Whatever ""level"" you happen to be at

* **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won

***
* The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win

Inspired by the recent poster who did a great job recounting the things about his life which made sense

I'm ADHD - PI (or SCT

* Every Wednesday in 3rd grade we had to take out our spelling homework and the teacher called on random students to read aloud. Every Wednesday I pretended to drop a pencil and hide under my desk for the entire period (never once actually completed the spelling homework). 

* That same 3rd grade year I won an award for high achievement only given to one student in the grade (out of about 300 kids). I remember standing up on stage in shock

* Sunday nights gave me stomach aches in grade school. Thinking of all the homework I didn't do, Sunday nights still haunt me.

* I still have recurring dreams that I actually never graduated from college (I graduated 10+ years ago) because I missed a final exam or didn't turn in some required piece of paperwork 

* I've always felt the people around me at work are a fraction as smart as I am (hate to sound immodest but thats been my honest feeling), more so than raw intelligence.

* My friends used to call me Phoebe (from Friends) because I was so spacey. We could be having a conversation about cute shoes

* I could never put a cute outfit together with accessories and all and then manage to re-create that outfit more than once or twice. I'd lose the accessories

* Being ADHD (PI)

* My husband's fascination with my inability (and indifference) to wear matching socks.

* Doing incredibly well in a new school year or a new job for the first X months while I was hyperfocused

* I showed up to school on several occasions and until I sat down for class

* There literally have been MONTHS where I've done no work at all in the office (I work in a Fortune 100 company with a decently high position). My doctor still doesn't quite believe me when I tell him this.

  When I was a kid, depression, anxiety, and a host of other problems. 

  I spent almost my entire educational career in Special Education classrooms. 

  I wasn't like the other kids there either. My differences weren't visible. I didn't have ticks. I didn't have problems learning to read or to write. I could speak well and I was very apt at learning and memorizing facts that engaged my imagination. 

  I convinced myself that I was wrongly imprisoned

  My mom moved away from me when I was 16 and left me to live with my uncle. 

  I guess what I'm trying to say is that... I used to believe that some day I would grow out of my challenges and differences. I was convinced that once I was on my own that my true potential would reveal itself. 

  It didn't. 

  I struggled for years to adapt to the world that was completely indifferent to me and my differences. Nobody makes special exceptions for you. Not when they have to chose between their own well being and yours. 

  I couldn't keep a job. I quit every project I ever started. It was school all over again, no counselor, no support system. 

  I grew bitter and angry with my childhood and everything that had happened

  I was mad at my mom for putting me in Special Ed. I was mad at being grouped with people who were physically disabled or developmentally disabled. I was mad at adults who kept having me tested and evaluated. 

  I felt like being different was a thing that people had done to me. And if they'd just left me alone I would've been fine. 

  It's taken me nearly 30 years to realize that the truth is much more complicated than that. 

  My childhood wasn't perfect

  It gets better when you realize that being different doesn't necessarily mean you're unhealthy. It doesn't mean you can ""get better"" one day. 

  It gets better when you get to know yourself and stop pretending that you have to be like other people. That you've got to live up to anybody else's expectations. 

 When you know who you are and what you've got- your strengths and weaknesses and quirks

  But first I had to stop blaming. It isn't anybody's fault that I have ADHD. It isn't anyone's fault that I have a learning disability. Nobody has to take responsibility for that but me. 

  And then I could finally let the people who love me back in

I'm 43, I had just lost my house, had to move, and had a extremely challenging job that suddenly required a lot of unplanned business travel.

I spent almost six weeks on the couch unable to do anything. I was depressed. After the docs figured out I have ADD

But, I quit. Looking back, it was for the best.

So

Everything was going along just fine until this week. I'm not sure what happened. I had three solid months of productivity and energy and suddenly ... whamo!  I haven't accomplished a thing - business-wise - all week!

1361554036.0,1913xn,What happens when the drug that fits your brain goes off the market.,geeners,40,8,20,"I was diagnosed with ADHD as a junior in college.  I went from taking summer classes to raise my GPA enough to enter the nursing program to getting on the Dean's list after I started treatment.  

This was 1996, and was unable to switch gears for even minor things.  It was a strange feeling.  And it made me really tired.

Anyway

Do normal people feel like that all the time?  Without medication?  Do they have any idea how lucky they are?

Even after college, of course.  I found, during my free time, that I had *creativity*.  I found myself focusing on creative hobbies that I never had the desire to do before.  And I had plenty of focus to complete entire projects!

In 2002

In 2005

Since then, give me palpitations.  In conjunction with high blood pressure that I have, the palpitations scared me.  

So I take tiny doses of Adderall now, but my surroundings are chaotic, cluttered,  and disorganized.  It doesn't help that I have a toddler that undoes everything I *am* able to organize and put away.  I still write for the blog, but it's not the same and it's rare (I usually get the desire to write if I've taken an Adderall for something else).  Forget doing anything creative.  I have a lot of *desire* to learn new crafty hobbies, but nowhere near the focus it takes to follow through on anything.  The last crafty thing I did while on Cylert was temari, and it was so much fun.  I still look at all my supplies and wish I had the focus to take it up again.

So my mind is back to drifting along to wherever the current takes it

But when I actually think about the situation, and now it's gone and I can never have it back again.  To be overdramatic and probably insensitive - I feel like I was born an amputee that was eventually given one of those super-fancy prosthetics only to have it replaced with a wooden peg just when I'd finally figured out how to harness my potential.

Thanks for reading.

Enter loss-of-interest, and if I can manage it I'll relocate to keep my focus. The only issue being that I won't have any of my electronics hardware tools. I only mostly have software left to do and it is down to coding work which is entirely concentration draining to me.

1342469389.0,wnt84,My boyfriend is going through the process of being diagnosed with ADHD. Sometimes I have a difficult time dealing with his distracted brain. How do I gain a better understanding of what he is going through so that I can better support him and be patient with him?,solare1123,38,7,30,"I'm not sure if this issue has already been addressed here

My boyfriend (21/m) and I (20/f) have been together for almost five months. He's one of the best guys I've ever known--so smart, funny, supportive, caring, an all-around good person whom I love. We've become best friends since we started dating. 

Background: Long story; he was diagnosed as a kid but taken off the medication because it made him TOO focused and they thought the inattentiveness was more a side-effect of depression; after taking the medication for that they took him off of it because it seemed that he was “better” since he was behaving and doing well in school. In college

While we don't often disagree, I also hate putting things off. Consequently, it's always very stressful for me to be with him because I'm trying to do my work, while he's distracting himself with other activities (like browsing the web) when I know he should be studying. This results in him having to cram before exams all night and then him being tired the next day so that we're unable to do what we planned to do. Before we both left for the summer, we had planned to leave town a little later so that we might have time to spend just being together before we went our separate ways for a few months. However, we ended up having to fill our last days packing his things because he didn't have it done like he said he would. It ended up that I did in a few hours what would have taken him two days to do (if I hadn't helped him). During the process he would often get discouraged and them stop doing a task, deciding instead to start a new task without finishing the first task

Currently he is in a different continent doing volunteer work, or because something happened to him. Now that he has mobile Internet, it’s much easier, but he’ll say he’ll make me a video or write me something, but then not do it. I end up waiting and being disappointed because I miss him like crazy and anything I get from him makes me feel better about his absence. 

I know that what he is going through is something that he can't help, but it's hard to believe that all the time, maybe because I don’t fully understand it. It’s hard for me to separate his personality and his caring for me from the consequences of his having ADHD. 

**TL;DR** I’m just trying to be an understanding girlfriend and see where my boyfriend with ADHD is coming from. He accepts and tries to work with my faults; I want to do the same for him. Any advice? Even just links to helpful websites would be appreciated. Thanks!

*edited for formatting*


One of my biggest struggles in this lifelong battle for an organized life is that my mind gets really cluttered after about four or five days of the same schedule. Stuff starts to run together. Did I feed my cat today? I remember feeding him, but that might have been two days ago, or it could have been two hours ago. Etc. I've realized that changing things up tends to make things I've DONE easier to remember, but keeping a wildly varied schedule makes it exponentially harder to remember the things I have yet to do.


Anyway. What has always ended up happening is this: I'll last about two weeks, though, it's only three or four days) on some new schedule or routine, and then the dreaded brain fuzz starts to creep back in. Did I do this or that yesterday, today, or three days ago? What did I eat today? Oh god, I don't remember when I  checked my finances last; is my bank account overdrawn yet? 


Around the last week of December, I've rarely seen anything through my entire life), but I liked the idea of being both a morning person and a night owl, so I decided to dive off the deep end and give it a shot.


I've managed to, and I'm going on week three now. So far, I've managed to work out regularly, eat healthy meals regularly, keep my living space relatively spotless, feed my cat and scoop his litter twice a day, and basically keep a relatively cool head.


And the dreaded brain fuzz? It hit me last night, make breakfast, have a cup of tea, and slowly review my calendar completely chased it away. Added bonus: I'm slightly groggy during the day sometimes, but it's nowhere near the epic levels of drain and fatigue I normally deal with on a daily basis. Suddenly, I'm like what is this, you mean there are more than four useable hours in a day?? For the first time in a long time

So why am I so quick to justify to people why I am ""only a waitress."" I am a damn good waitress, at 28 I should have done more.... but not for me, it's for my family, for the people I will see at my 10 year high school reunion, and because (for some strange reason) I need that ""I have a disability and I have overcome the odds and now I'm successful"" moment. 

Why can't I just accept that I will never be comfortable as a secretary, but I know that I love serving. I love the fast pace, the customers, the tips, the free food, the fact that I can take up to 14'000 steps in the run of a shift (according to my pedometer) and the fact that it's something that I've grown very comfortable with and when I forget myself, I take pride in. 

I really need to stop justifying myself. The school setting will never be for me and my adhd, but when I'm doing it so I can look prestigious in the eyes of others then it's fake and my energy fades away with each class I pretend to be paying attention to.

**So here I am in all my glory. What I need to accept is that:**

 - I am NOT naturally a studious person

 - I am passionate with what I love and hyperfocus can be a blessing in disguise

 - I am a great waitress and there is nothing wrong with that

 - I will never be organized

 - I am creative and fun. People tend to like to be around me because I am impulsive, *not mine.* I'm over it.

 - I will forget things

 - I will try my best. Some times I will be distracted, so I simply have to deal with it.

**I think I have ADHD Combined Type, and my opinion that I have it has only gotten stronger.  It explains so much:

* It feels like I have a million thoughts going on at once.  Sometimes it feels like my thoughts are bouncy balls and they are just bouncing all over my cranium.  Kind of like having multiple radios on at once.

* I have trouble keeping my attention on a task for more than 20-30 minutes at a time.  Sometimes less.  It feels like with anything that I don't want to do it takes me three times as long as a normal person because I stop doing it and just zone out or start doing something else unintentionally.

* I can't keep still to save my life.  I mean

* I talk a lot and really fast.  Almost every conversation I have usually ends with me walking away regretting something that I impulsively said without thinking.  I lose my train of thought a lot mid-conversation and often trail off as I'm talking if something else catches my attention

* I zone out for long periods at a time

*  I am incredibly forgetful.  I forget what I was thinking about minutes before, or really any project, pretty regularly unless I write it down.

* If I don't write it down I will forget to do it, and it basically runs my life.

Well

**My school history**:

* *Elementary school* : Got good grades in general, making noise during class at inappropriate times, and questioning my teacher.  I also got in trouble a lot for not paying attention.

* *Fourth grade*: my teacher mentioned at a parent teacher conference that I struggled paying attention in class and my eyes had a tendency to wander.  She didn't specifically say that she thought I had ADHD

* *Middle School* : 6-9 grade my behavioral issues in class subsided a lot

In 9th grade school started to get harder for me because it started depending a lot more on homework and studying rather than just being there.  By then it wasn't just math and history troubling me

Big mess of issues with the administrators later

* *High School* :  This is my first year at the high school, although in first quarter I got a 3.8.  I struggled only with physics, math, and history.  I got a C+ in second quarter for physics.  My average for physics is a B- from the three quarters, a B in math, and an A- in history.

**The thing is, however I struggle to pay attention in class and usually teach myself everything at home.  My parents got me a tutor for physics and math to help me get the education I miss during class.

**So I tried to explain it to my parents**:

* Dad: he agreed that I may have ADHD, he would take me to get diagnosed if I asked him too, I'm sure, but without my mom's support he probably won't go for it.

* Mom: Here lies my main problem.  I tested the waters first by just bringing up ADHD as a disorder in conversation

I was pissed by the misunderstanding of it all, although it *Was* overdiagnosed.

Well in any case I had her convinced that it was real, I have a 3.7 GPA, so I can't have ADHD.  I'm a little high strung is all, apparently.

So basically I don't know what to do.  I can't go behind my parent's backs and talk to a councilor

1375887341.0,1jvwwq,[Vyvanse] A noticeable increase in empathy?,thursdae,32,2,17,"Has anyone else experienced this while taking medication? 

Just a little background: I've always considered myself an open-minded individual. I was raised as such. I wasn't instilled with specific beliefs in religion or politics, my beliefs in such matters were shaped by other experiences as opposed to what my parents taught me. As such, while I often find people with views counter to my own in such serious topics, I try my best to see where they're coming from and why they believe the way that they do, even if they don't do the same. While I don't consider this to be 100% emotional, I consider it to be a form of empathy all the same.

Now.. I've always had ADHD. I'm now 23 and was officially diagnosed and received medication for it about a month ago, and the sex-drive suppression. Otherwise it just helps me see all tasks and such as much-more-easily surmountable than before I was on it. From simple tasks like doing the dishes like complex tasks like transferring all my computer hardware from one computer case to another (then reformatting because it fucked up some how). 

One other odd ""side-effect"" I've had is a very noticeable increase in my ability to be empathetic towards others. Being apologetic in arguments/debates and such even when it isn't necessary. Going out of my way to be nicer to others. Even going so far as to be a mediator for my parents while they're going through their marital problems

I'm a 30 year old woman with ADHD.  Although I was diagnosed in middle school and again in college, lazy, selfish and irresponsible and looking for someone or something to blame for your shortcomings, etc.) so things progressively got worse until a few weeks ago, when I decided to look into my treatment options.

In any event, but I am terrified of being a wife and a mother.  Shortly after the engagement was announced, my mother sat me down and basically told me I need to grow up and get my **** together because children need reliable parents and I am anything but.

I see that most people my age are much more established in their jobs, etc. but achieving those things seem like an impossibility to me.  If I can't even keep a job, show up to important things on time, find important documents, remember important things to do, and keep the chaos at bay, how the hell could I raise a child?  I've lost many friends by repeatedly failing to do things they counted on me to do and/or showing up late to extremely important events in their lives, and that is incredibly daunting.  I can't bear the thought of someone being married to or raised by me and having to deal with decades of let downs and chaos.  Or worse---have ADHD him or herself

""This is what it is.

Its a fog. Its starting and stopping

It’s paranoia and frustration, that I wish I could fix. It’s my weight, my behavior, my lack of commitment to anything.

It’s believing in myself one minute and then remembering why I hate myself the next.

Stop fucking saying that it’s not real. You have no idea what it’s like listening to some people tell you that medicating yourself for something that you struggle with is not okay

You don’t have a right to have an opinion about the struggle until you’ve experienced it first hand.

I’m smart, complete anything, and then those windows close and I’m in the dark again. Everything stops, i’m back at square one, and I hate myself a little more each time.

I don’t like to complain
It doesn’t take a break

You think i’m neurotic? You would be too if your fucking brain wouldn’t shut up.
You think that i’m a hypochondriac? Try getting diagnosed with a disorder at 6 fucking years old

You think that I need to calm down? Really? Me too. I wish I could. I’m not gonna smoke weed

Did I miss that detail? Thats because I don’t see time like you do. You see it as a chain of events, so I did my best and missed a detail. I’m sorry.

Imagine looking at everything all at once. I’m not talking about your surroundings, it’s literally accompanied by everything in the world that could relate. When you think about getting groceries, you think about going to the store and buying groceries. I think about which grocery store, what time i’m going, if i’m going to be able to run other errands, what list i’m going to make, whether or not I will have enough money, If i should clean out the fridge first to make room
I think about all of that, because if you don't, you’ll forget half of the details. Then you find yourself at the grocery store with not enough money, or forgetting that lunch date with your friend because of all that space was taken up in your brain... over grocery shopping. I can’t do anything without experiencing some kind of anxiety about the unplanned details. Don’t tell me I should fix it, or that I should get over it, because I can’t. You fix your diabetes, or your blindness. Get over it.

I ruminate, in my head until I understand it. 

Some people say that people with this disorder are gifted, but my brain just isn’t wired like yours. 


I’m sorry if I zoned out on you in conversation. I understand that to most there is no excuse, but by the time i do, You’re already done talking and i’m too upset with myself to ask you to repeat yourself.

I’m sorry if I missed our date, I care about you more than anything in the world. I don’t know if this has to do with ADD, but my biggest issue is that I feel completely happy and content to see someone when I make plans with them. THen when the time comes down to it, I literally feel like a different person. An angry, tired, depressed person. I want to hide that person from you. I don’t want to come to starbucks with a grumpy look on my face, unable to focus on our conversation and thus looking like a jackass because I can’t listen. I will zone out on you

I’m sorry if I take my time. Please don’t assume I’m selfish, and pondering, and thinking. When I finally got to a point where I couldn’t think anymore about it, I would do it. But the reason is because i’m afraid of failure. I dont want to let you, or myself down. Because I couldn’t handle it. I couldn’t handle seeing you so disappointed in me. Not knowing if i should blame myself or the disorder. I promise you that 9 times out of 10, I am blaming myself. 

I’m sorry for everything I’ve ever done to any of you. I love you all so much, stupid and depressed all over again. Because many can brush that kind of thing off after awhile, but I never forget those looks.

1363837491.0,1apnd1,Some tips for dealing with the academic world and ADHD,meeplepie,39,8,18,"This is my first text post on reddit, so please bear with me. Here are the things I did to keep myself organized and on top of the work load:  


- Make Sure: Before you switch majors or before you choose one


- Day planner: This thing is a must. Write down every due date for every assignment AS SOON as you get it. Ditto for test, anything you need to remember for a certain day. And check that sucker often. Every time you sit down to do some work.  


- Binders: Keep binders for each ongoing course. If you put multiple courses in one binder


- Prioritize: As soon as you get home everyday, and estimate how long you will need to complete it or study for it. This is really hard at first, but as you get to know the coursework and professors, it will get easier. It will probably never be exact, but a general idea is good. Write down the estimated time to complete in your day planner next to the part where you marked the due date. Every time you sit down to work, look at that information and just having it there will help you figure out what needs your attention first. Doing this in the off-time spares you the panic when the due dates start rolling around.  


- Scheduling: Set a schedule for yourself for your out of class work. Be realistic, you know how that will end. I found that although I could almost never follow the schedule exactly, it gave me a general idea of what I wanted to do, so I would have an idea when I sat down instead of aimlessly scrabbling to figure out what needs to be done. It helps to do this at the same time that you go through your assignments etc. and estimate how long each one needs. Allow yourself a little leeway in the scheduling because you're not looking to set yourself up for failure. Take your estimate time to complete and add a buffer that you deem to be comfortable wiggle room. Sometimes I would allow an extra half hour, sometimes an extra two hours. If you finish early, don't stop, move onto the next thing instead until your schedule for the day is completed. The point of scheduling is not so much to do everything at the exact specified time, but the rest of the time it is very important.  


- Study Groups: Get a circle of dependable buddies as fast as you can! At my school we did a lot of group work, and they will return the favour. This is even a good idea for ""solitary"" assignments, as you can still work through them together. Use your hyper-focus to your advantage in group work. When the group is splitting up tasks, volunteer to do the parts that really interest you and you will do an amazing job on them!  


- Stick Around: Staying at the school after classes is prime time to get some work done. The computer labs and library (at my school, even for an hour or two, I felt more productive and inspired by being surrounded by focused people. Plus, causing distractions makes you feel like a jerk so you're less likely to do it! You're closer to resources and have a lot fewer distractions than at home.  


- Set Goals: When I would stick around at school, set a goal or two for the session. This takes a fair bit of willpower to abide by, but the payoff made me feel like a million bucks so I found it got easier with time because of that. Pick an assignment to do, or a chapter to learn, whatever. Tell yourself over and over that you're not leaving until it's done. The hardest part is holding yourself to it, but if you're stubborn like me, you almost want to do it just to spite yourself and prove that you can. Don't go overboard with huge goals, realistic goals. If you have a big project to do, one that is really interesting to you and one that is not


- Distract Your Hyperactive Side: Whenever I would study at home, but it almost tricks part of your brain into trying to figure it out, leaving the rest of your brain alone to get things done. Sometimes I would also go to my mother's house, or a friend's house and just set up there for an hour or two while they had other things to do themselves. This only works if the person whose house you visit will definitely not distract you and understands why you're there. Another way to do this is to play white noise in the background. Some people say music helps, but I find I just focus on that too much to get anything done. White noise was a great solution to calm myself down and focus.  


- Study Often: Studying every day is an amazing thing to do, I could only achieve it maybe 20% of the time. But even that was worth it. The best possible way I found to study, and it took me a long time to figure it out, is to write out what I'm studying. It takes a lot longer, but I found that by reading the material and then rewriting it in my own words, I was not only ensuring that I understood it, but by writing it again I retained the information much better than if I was just reading it. Ditto for studying with friends. Teaching someone else something you understand will ensure that you truly understand it, I would realize I was missing an important part and that would save my butt. We would work through it together


- Study with Highlighters: I found this to be a great method of getting through studying. As I would study


- Practice Problems: Almost every math and physics (and everything in between) textbook has them. If the book doesn't


- Communicate with your Profs: You don't have to tell them you have ADHD, or even better, having them see you working after hours in the lab/library. Most profs love this, and when dealing with ADHD, you're going to need to have them on your side. Not only will this show them that you are working your butt off (which pays off when you need that extension or a .5% mercy mark), but it will genuinely help you nail down the complicated stuff.  


- Don't Be Hard on Yourself: This stuff probably isn't always going to work. I still had points where I forgot stuff or couldn't stick to a schedule and all that. I would also feel pretty defeated in those moments


So there it is. These are the things that got me through an engineering degree with untreated ADHD. These skills came from trial and error

***  
***

The fifth session addressed “overcoming emotional obstacles.”  

##### I. The first step in managing and changing feelings of depression and anxiety is to become aware of the automatic thoughts that trigger the feelings.  
1. **Take note of when you have the feelings of** ***anxiety or depression*** -- try to label them (anger, anxiety, etc.) and then ask, “What was I thinking just now?  What were the images or words?”  (You will likely notice many of them are ‘cognitive distortions.’)

2. **Challenge the automatic
 * What is the evidence that this thought is true?  *(“Last time I didn’t study as planned
 * Is there an alternative explanation?  *(“At that time
 * What’s the *reasonable* worst that can happen?  *(“I will fail this midterm
 * Could I live through it?  *(“I might panic even more if there’s more weight on the final, rearrange my schedule, and re-take the course.”)*
 * What’s the best that could happen?  *(“I quit wasting time worrying and start studying NOW
 * What’s the most realistic outcome?  *(“I call my boss to take tomorrow off, but I can maybe pick up a shift on the weekend.”)*
 * What’s the effect of my believing the automatic thought?  *(“I panic and freeze, which ruins my study plans for the next day.”)*
 * What could be the effect of changing my thinking?  *(“I actually get some studying done
 * What should I do about it?  *(“I can practice challenging those automatic thoughts -- it can’t waste any more time than my panicking does
 * What would I tell a friend who’s in the same situation?  *(“Stage fright or test anxiety won’t help you perform better.  Can you write down a list of all the things you need to do, tomorrow, next week, etc.’ and then focus on the ‘now’?”)*


##### II.  Cognitive Distortions:  
1. **All-or-nothing thinking** or **perfectionism:**  *“If I don’t do this NOW
2. **Overgeneralization:** *“I’m bad at EVERYthing!”*
3. **Selective attention:** *”My teacher hated my essay
4. **Disqualifying the positives:**  You don’t ‘believe’ your friend who says you look nice today becasue you think s/he’s just ‘trying to be nice.’
5. **Jumping to conclusions:**
 * **Mind-reading:**  You assume someone asking your for more information does it because they don’t believe you.
 * **Fortune-telling:**  *“I know I’ll make a fool of myself at the party and have a bad time
6. **Personalization:**  *“That person left the room during my speech because I’m boring--it has nothing to do with the food poisoning from the questionable fish some people were served.”*
7. **“Should” statements:**  Don’t use “should, *“I *should* be able to work at top efficiency the entire day.”*  This is inhumanly impossible!
8. **Catastrophizing:**  *“If I don’t get this job

* In my school years I made a point of getting to know my teachers

* I buy as many of the things I need as possible in huge bulk (six month supply or more)

* Cruise control.  I won't buy or rent a car without it; it keeps me from speeding or slowing too much; I drive about 7 mph over the limit unless I see signs I need to slow down (like a speed trap

* All my bills pay themselves via my credit card (for points.)  My credit card pays itself--in full--every month from my checking account.  I keep a few extra thousand in my checking account just in case.  I'm losing some money on investment interest I could be making

* I was diagnosed in college but they didn't treat me for it (expensive, with an extra hour.  My scores jumped from Ds to As from just this.

* I, forced socialization, forced exercise, forced schedule/routine, and a steady paycheck.  This helped me immensely.  In the later ranks I had more and more paperwork to do and am starting to founder; I'm trying to get sent out somewhere operational where I don't have to spend all day at a desk filling out reports and doing other things that are my personal hell.

* Social interaction was hard for me because people are boring and, introduce myself, and make conversation while I ate.  I would ask them questions about themselves.  Normal people often don't have hobbies, haven't read books lately, and so on, but they've watched movies, they did something last weekend, and so on.  If you ask people questions about themselves and let them talk?  They'll tend to like you

I'm not a great person, and I'll monitor this in case you guys (who may be way smarter or more functional than I am) have better ideas.

Oh yeah:

* I got a run partner.  A workout buddy is the only thing that keeps me exercising regularly.  This exercise is probably helping keep me sane

* I eventually got a Significant Other

Good luck

I desperately need ADHD-friendly tips on how to become a punctual person...,IamMorrisTheMoose,30,2,55,"**TL;DR: The punctuality gods are against me.

  *Whoa! Hey there, don't worry - I won't force you to read it all. The TL;DR gives you enough of a gist of what I'm looking for. The rest is just the details (though I imagine many of you can relate...).*

 
 I hate ""time"". It always seems to fuck me up and I feel like I'm constantly running after it


  So, it's not like I'm regularly arriving 30 minute to an hour late. I'd say my average is 6-7 minutes late, but nevertheless, this is not okay. I need to arrive 0 minutes late. My god, I hate minutes. and time.
 
 
  Now, and therefore I am the go-to substitute for a number of positions whenever that assigned person is out of the office for whatever reason. I am constantly cleaning up and fixing other people's mistakes. I train new hires because I'm good at training and teaching people. This is why they've kept me around for so long despite my tardiness. But for some reason, all of that matters less than my arrival time. And I can assure you that my job is in no way ""time-sensitive"". It's a lot of standing around and waiting around for someone to give me something to do. 


 I wish my boss wasn't such an enthusiast of punctuality, for fucks sake (which is often a reason for my lateness). I feel like his focusing on my being on time and hounding me about it only makes it worse. I'll arrive to work on time for a few days after having a Serious Talk With My Boss, but I inevitably slip for some reason and find myself right back to where I was - 7 minutes late. And now my boss is fed up. I can't be late again. I need help. 



**What the fuck do I do



 - I set alarms that go off every 15 minutes (and every five minutes the last quarter-hour) leading up to the time I need to get out the door

- I try to gather all my shit the night before so it's all ready to go but that works for, I forgot what I did with it because odds are I strolled around the house with it in hand en route to god-knows-where, then set it down in the least logical place possible.

- My clocks are set 5-20 minutes early

- I think about possible consequences for arriving late to work but that just gets me all hot and bothered (and not in a good way) and stresses me the fuck out which


- if I do manage to leave on time, or the railroad track barriers will be stuck in the down position so no one can proceed (that's happened twice already), or the road will be closed due to a swat team raid so I have to turn around and take the longer alternate route (it's happened as well).

I've been frequenting this sub for a while, as I haven't quite fully come to terms with it all yet.  It helps me to write things down and just get them out, and maybe it will be helpful for someone else.

After dealing with the symptoms of ADHD my whole life

I've been on Adderall for a little over a month now.  The first week was rough, am a single dad, and generally have more responsibilities than maybe I should.

Through treatment and the help of tips in this subreddit

However

I've been in a lot of scraps, and had and lost a lot of friends.  The violent tendencies can probably be chocked up to my surroundings growing up, but lately I feel a lot of guilt about other relationship problems.

Ultimately, moody, forgetful, and inattentive.  Instead of trying to be level with her about things, I was stand offish and kept a lot of things to myself.  Instead of dealing with things, I was just a jerk and shut down.

This pattern has carried through many of my friendships.  I can think of many cases, forgetting to follow through on things, and generally being a kind of messy person.  My standoffish behavior has turned a lot of friends into enemies.  These are things I never really noticed or thought of before, and now I notice, and I've been thinking about them a lot.

My family life has also fallen into a lot of the same traps.  I grew up without a father and without anyone able to ""fill-in"" the gap.  I feel this has made me incredibly stubborn, and we have a very ""rocky"" relationship because of these tendencies.

I have a close friend

So now I'm in this place of awareness.  I'm aware of how difficult of a person I am and have been to deal with

The question is, people know that I appreciate them?  It's been a really heavy burden for the last few weeks.

Do I write letters, and I want to make the absolute best of it.  Getting ahead in school and work is easy, but making up and getting ahead in life is a much more daunting task.

**What is the biggest benefit I've experienced?**

I'm much less of an asshole to my wife and kids. Before taking the medication I was very uptight and anxious. I felt that I didn't have the time to do the things I needed and wanted to do. I took that frustration out on my wife by complaining that the house wasn't clean or more specifically that I was working harder than she was. This wasn't the case

She'd tell you I'm a much different person. I stop and listen to her and my kids when they talk to me and engage in meaningful and supportive conversation. I'm much more empathetic. Previously

Overall

Although I no longer experience the blissful *high* as I did for the first two weeks or so, school, family and personal projects so much faster than I ever have.

I'd give myself a +1 to Dexterity. I don't think I'm more intelligent

**What are some of the detriments I've experienced?**

Occasional inability to sleep. At times, go back to sleep, get up about 7AM. My sleep is not as deep and restful as it had been. I think I can improve this by reducing my caffeine intake, but I'm a bit of a junkie.

Dry mouth for the first few weeks was inconvenient. I just drank more fluids (read Diet Mountain Dew). It was just annoying. In the past week it's nearly gone.

Sexual dysfunction - I could achieve an orgasm but its quality was substandard. It was much like expecting an excellent steak dinner from the finest chop house only to be served a McDonald's Big Mac. This side effect persistent for several week but now seems to be lessening.

Reduction of creativity - I used to be able to leverage my low grade depression to better ""tune into"" or ""feel"" different types of music. I'm a huge music fan and a recreational player in a band.  I have to work a bit hard to feel the music. I sing, connecting with the emotion of a piece of music is key. Before medication, I could drop into the mood of a piece in seconds, especially if it was dark. Now it takes a bit more work to be authentic. It feels more like business than pleasure.

On the upside, solos, etc.

Overall I'd say -1 to Constitution.

**What would I change or what tips do I have for others?**

When I had the flu and was sick for a week I stopped taking it so I could get high quality sleep.

Although I hate breakfast

My appetite has dropped and I have to consciously eat. What I need to improve is eating very nutritious food since I'm not eating as frequently or as much as I used to.

I've stripped away many of the superfluous projects I was interested in. I eliminated as many distractions in my environment as possible. I threw out a ton of crap, etc. It was friggin GREAT! I loved doing it. I closed the loop on sooooo many open items. I could write an entire book on this topic alone. Liberating!

1334720951.0,sfgb7,My ADHD success story...,arapaport86,32,3,25,"So I'm writing this for the second time. Even with how far I've come I still have a problem with putting my thoughts into and easy to follow story. But my point to all of this is that I have ADHD and I went through really hard times yet I somehow made it out on top.
So up until college life was pretty simple and awesome.  I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 5 and ultimately went on meds and ended up graduating in the top 10% of my class and got a really good score on my SAT and in turn got into a really good college.

The summer before my freshman year my doctor said that he would no longer be treating me anymore and I was basically on my own.  By that point I figured that I could handle the ADHD on my own so I didn't argue it.  Unfortunately what I failed to realize was how much different college would be than high school.  It turns out my mother had a huge role in my success in grade school...she was always there hounding me and pushing me to do homework and wake up on time for school etc etc.  Well college started and I no longer had that structure...or any type of structure to be honest.  I started oversleeping

This was my first taste of failure and I had never been more devastated..and neither had my parents. It was at this point that my relationship with them really started to tank. I was an embarrassment to them and I could tell...it was an awful feeling and I started to slip into a deep depression. I was constantly being threatened with being kicked out of my house and my parents would yell at me and just flat out told me how much I let them down. It was incredibly painful. At this point I had fallen so low that all I could do was entroll into a junior college and try to get my crap together and hopefully transfer into a 4 year school.

That first semester of jr college was....awful...theres just no other way to say it. I felt like I was surrounded by mediocrity and that I was doomed to just wait tables. On top of that...I was STILL doing bad in my classes. Th depression...the anxiety...my relationship with my family....it just kept getting worse. This was the point where I finally decided to let go of my pride and asked for help. I called around and I found a psychologist who actually specialized in young adults with ADHD. I told him my situation and this is when I learned that he too had originally flunked out of school and worked his ass off and became a doctor and that he wanted to work with me especially and that he would see me once a week and treat me and all of this for free.

My first time actually visiting him and talking to him was really brutal...it was the first time I actually talked to someone about everything I was going through and I broke down right there. I bawled like a little girl and thats when we finally got started. He put me back on meds and counseled me every week like he said he would. Even though I was back on meds

So fast forward a year and a half....a VERY frustrating year and a half. I was still dealing with depression and anxiety and for the most part my parents had no faith in me and still saw me as a disappointment but this is where things started to change. Every year since I flunked out I would apply to multiple schools

So after a year and a half with my doctor I finally said goodbye but we agreed that I would call him at least once a month and he would still write me scripts for meds. I went off to school and after a shaky on my own I finally found my groove. At first I was really embarrassed around everyone because at the end of the day I still felt like a failure. During my entire time in school I had become so self conscious over the fact that I felt like I was behind so I would never really ever open up to anyone...and on top of that my counselors could not tell me what my predicted graduation date would be...it seemed like the finish line was still out of sight.

Well after getting the ball rolling...it started to roll fast

I am a year and a half into my job and have never been happier. My parents are incredibly proud of me, no more depression...just lots of hard work ahead me doing something I really love to do.

I know this is really long winded and I'm sure I left some stuff out. I have to be honest...near the end of writing this my ADD started to kick in hahaha. At the end of all of it though

Welcome to part II of To Accomplish Tuesday! We had **14 people** accomplish MANY MANY tasks each. ([Check out last weeks thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rg1qf/to_accomplish_tuesday_share_one_thing_you_would/)) **Can we get 25 people this week?** *We can get at least 25 upvotes...right guys (and girls)?*
***
By sharing your goal semi-publically we can keep each other and **accountable**...and **celebrate in our small successes!**

By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, and you will feel like doing more. 

* **Never posted on Reddit before?** I welcome you to make this your first!

***
* **Just put ONE goal.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? 
* **When would you like to finish OR start it by?** By commiting to a date/time
* **Edit your comment when done** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you).
* **Create another when finished** - When you finished your first task feel free to add another! 

***
**Tips**
* Your tasks/goals should ideally be SMART goals: **Specific, relevant, and time-bound**
* **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable. Study 2 hours is. 

* **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say. Clean room for 10 minutes or pick up trash in room.
* **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer. Google calendar. Agenda. Write it down so you don't forget. Our working memories are flaky...
* **Start small** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle. Pick a room instead. **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** Commit to studying one hour to make it easier on you..


***
**Examples from last week:**

* Unload the dishwasher
* Pack for moving early
* Email professor
* Study X hours a day (though I suggest starting small with minutes)
* Make an appointment with doctor
* Clean car (get trash out)
* many more....

* **What** - ~~I want to **get started on my taxes**. *If I get them done this week my wife said I can buy a DSLR!*~~

My approach to ADHD is one that's fairly scientific and pro-medication. I haven't yet mentally ironed out what my policies will be, though!)

A note about merging with /r/ADD, but I'll talk to /r/ADD's mods and we'll see what we can find out. I'll update you when I have more to report.

I was just wondering if anyone else could relate to what I go through on a daily basis with ADHD-PI (or the two other versions of ADHD).

I don't struggle with recognizing emotions, or angry. I'd even go as far to say that I'm fairly decent at predicting what's going to happen based on the mannerisms that a person is exhibiting. However, my problem lies with being emotional when anyone comes to me with a problem or accomplishment. I can feign emotions quite well, but it's quite rare when I actually do feel something. Also, the few times that it's happened, I don't know how to deal with them and whatever I'm feeling is painted all over my face  and I can't hide it at all. 

Also, I played soccer in high school because I could see the ball and see the goal, but I couldn't even fathom why people did cross country because those runners were competing against a clock and had to run miles before seeing the finish line. I bring this up because I think it's a perfect analogy for how I performed academically. I knew the goal was to get into a good college, but I couldn't see it immediately so I didn't really try. Just putting it out there, I scored in the 95th percentile for the ACT and the SAT, yet I graduated highschool with a cum. GPA of 2.5.

I've also always struggled with dating. It's hard to convince myself to actually go after someone because of issues with self esteem (although I'm in pretty decent shape). And then when I do

A little bit about me, and I'm currently taking 36 mg Concerta once a day. I can honestly say the medicine is fantastic and has changed my life in terms of patience, grades, and paying attention in classes (rarely do I fall asleep during lectures). Also, if anyone is looking for a good app for exercising (running has always been super boring for me and I just never feel like doing it for extended periods), I'd like to recommend 'Zombies Run!' and 'Zombies: 5k'. It's got a storyline to it and has helped me stay motivated in running on a regular basis. Cheers! Thanks for reading/replying!

TL;DR
I have ADHD-PI, dating and things like that. Also, would be interested in finding out any tips you use to focus, adjust, and deal with ADHD-PI without medication

edit: My family pediatrician suspected I had ADHD-PI when I was in 8th grade but my parents brushed it off because one of my teachers said I was just being lazy and it was my fault for my grades (interestingly enough, 1.5 in middle school, 2.0 going into HS, 2.5 graduating HS, 3.0 in college).

I did the therapy group for about 2 years and have now stopped.

That's a bit of my history. Now my current problem:

About a month ago

But, and deliver a thus mediocre job.

This is really frustrating. I know exactly what I have to do

For example, which brings me to new stimuli that I get distracted by and before I know it it's 3 hours later.

Another aspect is a very sickening feeling when I try to go against this feeling and try to work on the project. But it makes my stomach twist. I suddenly really really really don't want to work on the project. This is strange, I love to create something from scratch. 

So for about a month now

This week I went to my doctor, to help me concentrate.

I really really hope I have ADD, and it made me able to concentrate for 5 hours. I felt euphoric, like I could finally make all the homework I want! I was so happy. But at that time when I tried the ritalin, I still was in therapy, and my group psychologist said to me that I probably don't have ADD, that I should stop taking Ritalin. So I stopped. But I've always felt that something was wrong with me and I feel very strongly that the psychologist was wrong about me too. I think she mis-diagnosed my ADD. I think I have it. I did a few test on the internet that all said I have ADD. Guess I will find out if I have it or not next week at the doctor's office.

With this in mind it got me thinking about how so many people in my mothers side of the family have ADHD like symptoms and it hit me

I believe ADHD is linked to the X Chromosome and its a Semi-dominant Allele that expresses parts of itself along side more dominent alleles. With this hypothesis it would explain why ADHD is more prominent in males and why its been passed down through my family like it has.

Does anyone else have a thoughts on my hypothesis?

1349048085.0,10qexv,I hate my life and it's getting hard to convince myself that it's worth living. I want help but everything takes so much time that I've lost hope. Is there anything I can do?,Rabbitkiller,32,5,44,"This isn't going to be a happy one

I hate my life. It's a shithole.

I couldn't pay attention when I was little. My teachers always complained that I never did any homework and that I seemed very jumpy. Despite this they never said anything about me having ADHD

My parents never said anything either. My dad is the ""life is hard but you gotta move on and work hard"" kind of guy and has probably never heard of ADHD and would probably never believe such a thing. I told my mom that I suspect that I have ADHD and she said that she suspected that there was something wrong with me. I was very angry at this

I suck at every possible thing that I could suck at at this moment. School, wheter I like him or not. I've talked to them if we can speed up the process but they tell me that it's not possible and that two months is nothing compared to what other people are waiting. Two months maybe doesn't sound like a lot of time but I'm not sure I'll live tomorrow.

Last week I told this organisation that I was feeling very suicidal and they made a huge fuss about it and said that I needed to get help immediately (lolwat) and they urged me to go to an acute psychology ward to get immediate psychological help. I was stuck in a ward for 7 hours with nothing to do but drink coffee and eat apples except fooling around with my phone. At the end of it I would have more likely died of boringness rather then suicide. Finally

She has now contacted the organisation that I should be on anti-depressing meds immediately and they will probably contact me soon. I'm feeling very weirded out because I think I should take care my ADHD before taking care of my depression

I hate my life and I just can't fucking wait two months before getting help. I was almost got hit by a car yesterday because I couldn't concentrate on the walking lights. I've talked to everyone I could think of and it's always the same: ""just wait, wait, WAIT"". I feel they are very unsympathetic and I can't get any non-medicated help anywhere before diagnosis.

There is one toher place that does diagnosis for ADHD but they apperantly take even longer time to diagnose ADHD. There are private doctors but the cheapest I could find was one who charged 2000$ for doing a god damn diagnosis.

There is nothing I can do these two montsh except contemplating suicide. I have courses I need to finish and tasks I need to do but I just can't be bothered.

I've told everyone in my family except my dad that I probably have ADHD and everyone was like ""ah

Is there anything I can do except not kill myself and wait for the test?
I've just lost hope of everything now. Can I do something?

Obviously, such as forgetfulness, concentration difficulties, etcetera: being able to do this is a major part of the reason people get diagnosed. 

However, like laziness, stubbornness, and so on. At the absolute extreme, I could imagine cases where someone was using ADHD to justify something like racism or domestic violence.

This problem is made more difficult by the fact that **ADHD can often resemble traits like callousness and laziness

I have so many things that I absolutely NEED to do but the thing is I genuinely can't be arsed because I know exactly how exhausting it is forcing myself to focus. Even if I do manage to do something it'll still be half-arsed and messy.

Even easy things aren't getting done for example: 
  I keep forgetting to shower and shave yet I HATE not being clean and having facial hair with a passion. 
  A girl I fancy text me yesterday and I still haven't replied even though I definitely want to (probably won't tell her I haven't showered). 
  I keep forgetting to eat and won't eat until I realize I'm trembling and can barely stand up yet I love food. Food is awesome. I even love saying food. 
  I also need to apply for jobs otherwise I'll end up not being able to pay rent and bills although part of that is being scared shitless of interviews
  I even thought of posting here last week but never got round to it.

But anyway I'm at a serious loss for what to do because I've never been this bad before any was wondering if anyone has techniques they use when they are like this (I'm assuming that other ADDers get like this :S)?

## Choose the participation method that works for you:
* **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish.  *(Ex. Set a doctors appointment
* **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week.  *(I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)*
* **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**

**Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*

***
By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community

By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, and you will feel like doing more.

♥ ♥ ♥ **Never posted on Reddit before?** I welcome you to make this your first! ☺☺☺

***
## Suggested Guidelines
* **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!)
* **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time
* **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you).
* **Small start.** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you can make towards your goal.  *I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.*

***
## Tips
* Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, relevant, and time-bound**
* **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable.  Study 2 hours is.
* **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say
* **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.  Google calendar.  Agenda.  Write it down so you don't forget.  Our working memories are flaky....
* **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead.
* **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*

***
## Examples from previous weeks:
* Unload the dishwasher.
* Study X hours a day (though I suggest starting small with minutes).
* Make an appointment with doctor.
* Get ready and *leave the house* for *any* reason.
* Clean car (get trash out).
* **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.”
*  many more....

* **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**

**Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*

***
By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community

By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, and you will feel like doing more.

***
## Suggested Guidelines
* **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!)
* **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time
* **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you).
* **Small start.** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you can make towards your goal.  *I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.*

***
## Tips
* Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, relevant, and time-bound**
* **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable.  Study 2 hours is.
* **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say
* **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.  Google calendar.  Agenda.  Write it down so you don't forget.  Our working memories are flaky....
* **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead.
* **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*

***
## Examples from previous weeks:
* Tidy room.
* Kill the Batman.
* Buy car.
* Go to work.
* Attend all my classes on time.
* Reschedule appointment.
* Mornings: brush teeth &amp; meditate.  Evenings: brush teeth
* Pay bills.
* Plan vacation.
* Go to the gym 3x this week.
* Break down chores by days so I can have 'a day off with my darling' before he leaves.
* **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.”

What I've also gathered is that a lot of people who take Strattera don't stick around to see if the side effects go away and immediately label it rubbish due to the side effects. Right now I have some pretty annoying side effects so I would love to hear from those that have been taking it for a good amount of time!

I'm not sure that my experience so far is worth talking about due to the fact that I haven't taken the 80 mg yet (I step up tonight). It's always hard to judge the positives when you are gradually building it in your bloodstream. I have noticed decreased anxiety which in turn is allowing me to handle anger issues and outbursts. I guess as I'm reading Reddit that things don't seem so jumbly. Productivity really hasn't changed much but that ""much"" may be the difference between the meds working and not. A small thing also is that I am looking for a job and an employer emailed me. Normally I'd push it aside and pretend it wasn't there because usually an email means they are going to pass. Well, most times they won't get back to you at all.

Anyway

* How is it legal for them to demand you tell them about your problems? Isn't there some privacy laws preventing that?
* Is there ANY good reason they would do this? Because

It sorta bums me out. I am a dude who thinks he might have a touch of the ADD, and anything that might dissuade them from getting help is criminal IMO.

*Plans that require a prior authorization for all mental health benefits but do not require such prior authorization for medical/surgical benefits are applying a NQTL that violates the parity law. Additionally

NOTE: My insurance DOES NOT REQUIRE any sort of pre-authorization for ANYTHING but mental health.

tl;dr - Parents don't believe in ADHD and other psychiatric deficiencies like it even though there's evidence everywhere that it is in fact real, but if you really intend to help me you'll probably need to read the entire post to understand. I'm sure many have you have been in or are in the same shoes i was in/still am in.

So here's my story:

When I was much younger, but even then I was still prone to distraction. My parents wrote it off as me just being young.

When I sit down, I play various organized drum beats. Still can't sit still. 

I can never focus on a task that NEEDS to be done

When I was in middle and elementary school, although I would read through a paragraph and realize that I wasn't paying attention the first time through and have to read it three or four times to get the gist of what it said. I still have to do that. My parents use the fact that I can read for hours on end as an argument against me having ADHD, even though I've explained how I'm still easily distracted while I'm reading.

Throughout school, I just couldn't(and still cannot) bring myself to do it. The same goes for work around the house, like cleaning my room or taking the trash out or putting away the dishes. No matter what ultimatum my parents(mostly my father) gave/gives me, I couldn't/can't bring myself to focus.

Now I'm in my first semester of college. I've basically screwed myself as far as classes go

A lot of my friends have been taking adderall to help them with studying for tests and writing papers(illegal, which I researched and found out is the drug that will replace adderall once it's patent is up(a lot of you probably already knew this, but I'm just trying to verify that I have done my research). I purchased the Vyvance from her, and I took it at around 10:00 AM Eastern Time today here in the U.S. My friends told me that when they take adderall that they are so keyed in on the work they are doing that they literally cannot look away from it. 

It kicked in at around 10:30 Eastern Time. What I've noticed so far with Vyvance isn't that I'm not in control, a mildly accelerated heart rate(really only when something evokes a very emotional response, I'm still at a normal heart rate when I'm doing something menial like taking out the trash or watching tv), and less of an appetite. I feel like I can perform to the best of my abilities like never before and that the world is mine to conquer.

I have no history of addiction to anything, and I smoke maybe once or twice a month.

As I am a brokeass college student still stuck on my parents health insurance and working just to pay for school

So here it is: How can I convince my parents to let me go get tested to truly see whether or not I have ADHD and get a prescription for Vyvanse or a similar drug? I need help with arguments as to how it would better my quality of life. I'm tired of disappointing my family and friends by not being able to follow through on anything I'm supposed to do

Also: Anyone here who takes Vyvanse as a prescription

Edit: And if anyone has any questions to ask whose answers may help my cause

Another Edit: For anyone who is wondering why I made a throwaway for this post

Hopefully the last Edit: Taking the Vyvance was a mistake. I did not take it in an attempt to self medicate. I mentioned that a lot of my friends take meds like adderall and vyvance  in order to help them study or write papers and such. The original reason I purchased it was to help write a paper that is due tomorrow that I had fallen behind on. But today I have talked to my professor about several of the problems that I had been having and he gave me an extension on the date I had to turn the paper in. He's an excellent professor and one of the people here I can relate to the most

&gt;How can I convince my parents to let me go get tested to truly see whether or not I have ADHD and get a prescription for Vyvanse or a similar drug?

It should have read:

&gt;How can I convince my parents to let me go get tested to truly see whether or not I have ADHD and get a professional opinion on my condition and what I should do

**What I'm asking of you:**  


Every time you see a bad ADHD article respond to it in the comments section if the site has one.  If you can't do it yourself

Comment to correct the publisher/author and to inform other readers who may read your comment.  

* Correct their mistakes as politely as possible.
* Admonish them for trivialising ADHD
* If you have the time and links
* Whenever someone says they ""cured"" their ADHD by changing their diet or some such
* If they appear to be publishing to sensationalise while publishing misinformation
* If they seem to have an ADHD agenda and you can point out a pattern on their behalf
* Find some way to insert in your comment that the writer clearly isn't a professional or relevant authority on the subject.


The diagnosis for ADHD comes straight out of the DSM.  In general
Psychiatric *disorders* are sometimes preventable and they are


Currently
* genetic/heritable

Some times I wonder if it's easier for them to be happier because of this. For instance


I, yet we work in the same department. When I take a physics class, I understand pretty much everything. The same thing happens with most disciplines. My professors usually give me props for my analysis and insight; yet, my GPA is getting lower and lower.

I have many talents, and I can't even finish my BA.


It's like I was telling another friend of mine, nobody ever suggested it. 

But when it comes to intellectual endeavors, and it renders everything else mostly useless, because I will never live up to the hype.


Add to all that

I can see how both things affect me socially: my ADHD makes it hard to have interest in relationships

The same thing happened to my mom. She used to devour books when younger and dreamed of being a writer/journalist, but unfortunately, she tells me that she barely graduate from college at the age of 33.

I've had ADHD all my life and it hasn't really affected my life much until I finished high school and moved on to real life. I was easily able to get straight A's in school without studying and I didn't need to hold a job. 

Fast forward a few years and I'm going into my fifth year in university for engineering. Luckily for me I've always done exceptionally well in maths and physics so I didn't fail out. However, went to the doctor, got concerta, got things under control and now I'm doing pretty well. 

Now what I wanted to talk about here is work. Between every university years I had to get jobs and keeping them was often very difficult. Most of them I ended up quitting without giving my 2 weeks notice after 2-3 months because for some reason I just couldn't handle doing repetitive work for more than a few months. 

What I wanted to ask from others with ADHD is how do you guys actually feel like when trying to hold a job that you cannot stand doing? Right now I'm painting houses for the summer. Been doing it for 2 months and I'm having a lot of trouble holding the job (Stopped taking concerta after the semester but planning on starting it again tomorrow to try and keep my job). I have a lot of trouble explaining how I feel myself when I'm put in a position that I don't want to be in. It somewhat feels like I'm losing control. Did you ever watch movies or tv shows where a drug addict doesn't have any drugs and is just pacing around nervously

anyone else feel the same way at times?  

adhd really has no plus sides for me. I'm 25 and my life is a haze that goes where ever the wind blows me and now i've become unable to cope with basic living, food, friendships, family.  my only option is to be homeless or kill my self.  I don't really have any problem with being homeless but i know in 5-10 years i'll hate my self for it.  

I've been to doctors/psychiatrists and what not

My only life line is going to school to study but i've dropped out of post secondary 5 times now

I'm so desperate that i've considered making meth(desoxyn) in my house just so i can feel normal.  I've also considered leaving a suicide note saying that adhd treatment should be more readily available for people like me..

I just wanted to make this quick post to say how great everyone in this community is and it's awesome we have recently hit 2

Also to remind everyone of a few things.

#####Upvoting posts
***
 We seem to have a disconnect around here with participating via comments and participating with upvotes. If you are taking the time to comment on a post upvote it

#####Read the FAQ
***
If you're new or even old and have yet to read the FAQ please go do so

#####IRC
***
On the side bar there is a link to the [IRC chat room](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=/r/ADHD). It is a great place to hang out and talk with other community members. There are also weekly meetups

#####Attitude
***
This is very important for any online forum. You can not figure a person out nor know their intent via a post over the internet so please be nice and respectful especially to those attempting to bring content into the community. If someone has posted an article it means they found it interesting or simply that we might like to discuss it. It does NOT mean the person posting agrees with the opinion of the article

#####Formatting
***
Formatting when posting a wall of text is extremely vital around here. You have to remember most around here have ADHD :p Reading a large wall of text with out any formatting to indicate main points or break up thoughts and sections is difficult and many will simply look at it and move on without reading. As you can see this post is formatted in a way that I find easy to read so hopefully so do others. Remember to think about formatting for long wordy comments as well. 

**Formatting is very easy**: 

[Here is the formatting help page](http://www.reddit.com/help/commenting)

* For the main sections I used h5 which is a header style. All you have to do is put two or more '#' at the beginning of a new line before the text you want as your header

* The horizontal lines are done by using at least three asterisks '*' on a new line.

* Bullets are listed above the comment section. It is done by going down to a new line and starting it with '*' followed by ' ' (a blank space) then your bullet text.

##Thanks for everyone's time

1331157109.0,qmblz,Hesitation and ADHD.,,31,6,28,"I just had a bit of a revelation today

As I get older (I'm 19), chores, finding a job, etc. I can't *start* anything. I thought it was ADHD, but I realized today that it's an *effect* of ADHD.

I was cleaning up after the cats, painful months of trying. I realized it was because I *need* to clean up after the cats, and I don't allow myself to hesitate.

My theory is, because otherwise I can't function without being all over the place. But now it keeps me from doing *anything*. I'm not a funny person anymore because I make myself slow down to think about that quip I was about to throw into the conversation, saying it belatedly. Instead of just jumping into cleaning, I would stop and think and plan. Because planning was something I was never good at. It's why my ADHD dad is poor and unsuccessful. It allows me to work out which parts of the thing I'm about to undertake are essential.

Except I overdid it. Now I plan and plan and plan and never do anything. Because doubts creep into my mind. Depression and hopelessness take over

I'm now taking a break from cleaning my room, and I'm getting it done. Planning doesn't work for me, because I can't do things in a preset order. It's good that I did plan a while ago, because now I'm not going to, say, attempt to organize my bookshelf before I've even gotten all of my books off the floor. I could have easily done something like that. I have those kinds of essential things in the back of my mind because I did plan ahead, but now I'm allowing myself to do what I want. I'm following my whims. And for the first time in a long time

**TL;DR. I learned that you need to plan ahead

Yesterday


**So I have some tips I've learned:** 


* **Sit at the front of the class.** You don't have to be 100% active in the class. It's just a fact that the best students sit toward the front. Plus


* **If something confuses you, I'll write it down on a paper in the question format. That way I can ask the professor to clarify after class or I can look it up on my own time. Clear things up as they confuse you. 


* **Don't let things slip by.** The key to thoroughly understanding something is *working* toward understanding it. In a math class, go over it silently over and over until it does. In a fast course, you'll be lost in a matter of minutes if you didn't understand the last topic. 


* **Only write down the essentials.** We've all experienced this. You try to be a good student by writing down everything the teacher says or everything that is on the board. Later on, I kept writing down pythagorean identities, when in reality, I didn't need them. Instead, keep a list of things covered, so that when test time comes, you can look it up if you're a little shaky. 


* **Take notes in a way that makes sense to YOU.** Don't be afraid to write things down in a completely different way than your peers. Instead of writing down thousands of formulas for Cos(A+B), while Sin formulas were the same. See, that makes no sense, but writing a note like that to myself clarified a big confusion of mine. 


* **Keep busy if you get bored.** This drove my professor nuts, I would space out. To remedy this, I kept my hands busy and my ears attentive. I WILL say, however, you shouldn't do this until you understand how the course will be for you. You might find that you need to write a lot down. Also, it would be polite to speak to your professors and explain that it helps you concentrate. They'll understand once they get your scores. 


* **Be practical and keep routines.** Every day before a test, I use graph paper as scratch paper and do all of the equations on there first. Then I do the equations on the test. I compare my work and if something doesn't look right, I'll do it again until it's perfect. I also make note of which equations I am confused by and make a point of going back to it every few equations. Another tip for math tests: Try starting at the back of the back. Most of the time, the more difficult equations are there. If you know them, brilliant! If you don't you can happily skip them and go back later. 


* **Take advantage of programs.** Look into your school's program for disabled students. If you get in


Anyway, work hard, and go easy on yourself! ",,False,self,t5_2qnwb,,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1k1m4c/school_is_go_so_well_i_just_need_to_brag_a_little/
1375392079.0,1jisnp,My diagnosis and treatment has given me my hobby back.,Heybatman,25,3,3,"If ADHD were a physical object

When my wife and I moved into our first house I found that I had a great passion for wood work. I would watch shows at nauseum when I was unemployed and build things in the garage as often as I could. What I quickly found was that my motivation to build something would quickly wane about half way through and I would find myself cutting corners to just ""be done"" with my project. It showed in the things I built.

I looked at a dresser that I built about 4 years ago, if I used 1/4"" ply then I would have had to glue up the pieces instead of just nailing them. That would have taken too long. 

On the other hand, I built a coffee table for my living room. It was a big project, I bought the wood rough sawn so I had to square it up and plane each piece to a perfect fit. Something that took me almost 2 weeks alone to do. I was dead set that my table would contain no metal fasteners. Everything would be glued properly as it should. This usually involves advance joinery that is time consuming and tedious. when I finished it I was pretty proud of myself. I accomplished exactly what I wanted to accomplish and the table looks perfect. I show it off to everyone who comes over, I'm able to show them the through mortises and the exposed breadboard tenons because they look perfect. The thing I was most proud of was the finishing. You can make a project look fantastic, but if you cut corners when finishing, it will ruin the entire piece. I spent almost an additional week sanding it over and over to the point where I was wet sanding with 4,000 grit paper. It is almost as smooth as glass.

If you can, it just trolls you even worse. ADHD is real, if it wasn't I wouldn't be fuming right now. 
	
I've had attention and learning problems my whole life but I really don’t consider it a big deal. I know what I’m good at and I build upon that. Evidence is I’m doing a Masters in one of the top schools in Canada. If I couldn't handle it, I’m talking about statistics. 

I love statistics. I’m good at it, I even bring earplugs to the exam just to block out the noise of people’s pencils scratching, coughing, chair squeaking, questions being asked, etc. You’d think that an exam room is quiet. Next time, sit in one and just listen to all the noise around you. Imagine if you couldn’t tune that out

Imagine writing down the problem on a sheet of paper, you get your result. Again the answer you get is not one of the choices. This time you go back and can’t find where you made the mistake. You go and redo all the calculations to find that you wrote the number you got from your calculator wrong. That also changes all the calculations you have done thus far. Time to go back and redo the question a third time. Finally you get the answer, only it took you an hour to a problem worth 4 points out of 40 that really should have been done in 20 minutes. 

Moving on to the next question, you replaced the word “and” and “with” which completely changes the meaning to the entire question. Time to restart once again.  Imagine this happening for every single question on an exam with 40 questions. 

So not only can I not read or write things down properly

Anyway, reading math problems and concentration, that’s when my brain decides to say “nope! Not happening! I’m going to make you suffer. And because you’re diligent and have been trained to check your work, you’re going to suffer even more because you’ll know that you’re wrong!”

Many people think that what I recounted are insignificant problems that “happen to everyone”

ADHD and learning disabilities are real and they affect an enormous amount of people. However, but at the end of it all, I get there too. I just need to exert more effort and have more patience for my annoying troll brain.

I only notice these symptoms when I'm stuck sitting at a desk. In social situations, I feel wonderful and social and I'm actually able to participate in conversation. I feel 'normal.'

**I can only seem to concentrate on things I'm truly interested in.** Which means no matter how hard I try

**I don't know what to do.** I've tried everything I can think of to try and cope. Nothing works. What am I doing wrong? Is it the medication? Should I ask about upping my dosage or should I look into switching to something else?

**Edit:** Wow

While I'm here I thought I might ask: Based on experience, because that really seems to be my biggest problem. ",,False,self,t5_2qnwb,1355139175.0,,

What if I had been diagnosed earlier?,hyperfocusedbeast,28,4,14,"I wish I had discovered this earlier but I had never thought about it in the past.  My background is that I did really well in high school (straight A's/valedictorian) due to my parents strict enforcement of studying and monetary incentives for doing well.  But then I nearly flunked out of college when I was on my own with no one to tell me what to do.  Somehow I managed to graduate with a CS degree and got a crappy job.  Switched to a programming job in finance by sheer luck/timing and struggled there in the beginning the same way I did at the previous job (got reprimanded for tardiness

7 years later I managed to do well somehow despite only really producing real work maybe 25% of the time I was at the office.  I think some of it is due to my uncontrollable need to speak during meetings and sometimes I come up with really good insights.  Now I'm a director and making over $200k just before being diagnosed.

Now that I've been diagnosed and taking adderall and i've read a few books on ADHD I am so much more productive.  I'm a beast at work and producing like I've never been able to before.  I'm not sure it's going to really matter since I've done okay for myself up until now but I definitely enjoy work a lot more.

Personal life has also improved.  A lot less fights with the wife due to me not forgetting to do stuff all the time and also being attentive to the wife's needs.    Started exercising after reading that it helps by joining a Crossfit gym.  I feel a lot better about myself and I'm more confident and in better shape.  I'm sleeping earlier and waking up earlier (6am).  This was impossible for me in the past where I could never make it to class during college even if it started at 10am. 

It's been about two months now since being diagnosed and I'm still really amped up about knowing that this has held me back all these years.  I'm trying to learn as much as I can about it and how to deal with it like making lists and reminders for everything.

I'm wondering however, done relatively well for themselves because they did find out about it?  Not sure many people can answer this here since it seems like most of the people here are in school or just starting out in their career.

I'm suspecting my maturity and stage in life now is playing a huge role in the effectiveness of behavioral modification and medication.",self,t5_2qnwb,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1386ve/diagnosed_with_adhd_at_age_33_and_it_has_changed/

1346101020.0,yx8u9,What is your ADHD superpower? ,jaybeans,32,10,73,"TLDR: ADHD isn't all bad

I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until two years ago

1- Great short-term memory....I never studied in grade school. I would review spelling words or notes the morning of an exam and usually pulled out at least a B. However

2- I'm great at assessing a situation and quickly drawing a conclusion...because before medication...if I didn't

3- I read people fairly well. Because I'd often get distracted before someone got to the point of their story, my subconscious starting categorizing and cataloging these responses and made it easy for me to separate when someone was lying or being genuine. 

So I'm curious. Does anyone else have ADHD superpowers you can think of?

1339528721.0,uyf46,Just how much of our struggles are self discipline?,PabloBablo,27,2,31,"I was diagnosed in 10th grade. I'm 25 now. I'm not here to debate the existence of ADHD as it was a night and day difference after I was diagnosed. 

My question with self discipline relates to failures due to ADHD. I've struggled so many times to do things I need to do. In 6th grade I grew so frustrated doing homework that I got burnt out. The struggle never realized a reward. My failures have almost made me numb to it

I have been trying to do some research intensive work. I let my deadline go and almost avoided thinking about it to protect myself from feeling like crap over it. I would go to the library

So for a short amount of time I have been using strictpomodoro for chrome. It blocks sites for your pomodoro time

So much of my struggles have been related to lack of effort i've been putting forth because I hate the feeling of failing, I don't like it. One feeds into the other.

But me just buckling down

I also believe it is hard to build self discipline as I can't sustain focused long term effort to make a change, doesn't get checked and I let it go. Being late, sleeping late, incomplete assignments have been such a part of my life for so long that I just accept it as being me, and it is harming my work ethic and effort in life in general.

Just wanted to vent during my pomodoro break. Back to work.

I just let things go.  I know I need to do things, it makes so much sense to let it go.  The smallest tasks are the hardest.  The reward is so small, but the pain never changes size.
