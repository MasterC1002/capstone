1 This thread is based on my thoughts, Reddit is about discusion, don't go all flame and hate on my theories.

2 This thread WILL contain spoilers. Probably all of it. I have no intention to use the [spoiler](/manga) function

3 Just for the sake of it

4 I am not a native English person. FYI I am Dutch and I even have dyslexia. This will contain a lot of grammar and vocabulary mistakes

5 This will be a long post. Get into a comfortable position

Well then

The reason I make this post is because there are still a lot of readers who read the chapters realy quick and don't pay attention to WHAT the characters are saying. If you read every chapter in 5 minutes, because most likely she had no second arm. This might be key in the future. 

This example was just as indication that there is a lot of hidden information in this series.

I answered a lot of questions about dragon slayers and magic and stuff. (I hope I am allowed to say that I can call myself an expert on this serie. And now

I answered a lot of questions about Natsu and Gajeel
But what is so special about dragon slayers and specificly Natsu.

Lets make a lits of things I am gonna cover:
- Age
- Magic
- Reunion
- Amnesia
- Time Travel
- Rave Master (oee


AGE.

Most people know this by now. Natsu is way older then anyone had expected. Why do we basicly KNOW this? 

-Fantasia arc or Battle of Fairy Tail arc. Laxus was planning on taking over the guild. He made a big competition, they have to be older then 80.

-chapter 23

- In later parts of this thread I will explain more about the age ""problem"".

MAGIC

Just t get a litte break of that age thingy and lets talk about his magic.
Fire dragon slayer magic. Thought bt Igneel
Natsu is able to use fire magic. But as we all know, I don't know a lot ofEnglish Fysic terms). Electricity can you see as a Power over time: P*t will make E. E is electrical energie. Q is energy.

If you compare the two you can pretty much say that both are the same. Q = Eelec. Or Energie.

We say that Natsu is a Fire dragon slayer, because his flames were from a diffrent type. He had to eat them in a special way. I think at that point Natsu ate the black fire not as fire, but as pure Energy.
Natsu was also able to eat pure etherion lacrima, his origional magic is pure energy and he can manipulate ""Energy"" magic.

REUNION

This will be difficult to explain. Lets start of with Natsu and Wendy.
Chapter 101. Grandine visits Igneel. I will litery quote one of Grandine her sentences: "" That boy(Natsu) Will eventualy meet up with Wendy soon. I hope they will get along well THIS TIME."" I myself read amost over this part. I can confirm that this is the legit translation. I have this particulair volume (I have up to volume 18) and I can even confim that Hiro Mashima approved the translation.

This means that Natsu and Wendy knew eachother before Wendy joined the serie. This is a bit strange, like this happend many years ago, why is Wendy her age 12? 
Prove that Natsu knows Wendy: The first chapter of the Oracion Seis arc. The moment Natsu saw Wendy and heard her name

Tenrou Island arc. Zeref appears and Natsu saved Elfman and Evergreen. Zeref sees Natsu and starts crying... ""Natsu

Sting and Rough. When they were youg, the dragons dissapeard. Natsu should be age 10 at that time. STING WAS 3. How in the name of the firts master, can a little boy of 3 kill a dragon? This doesn't seem right. Even if I am 2 years of with Sting his age.. a 5 year old killing his dragon? I can include this to my AGE theory. How I want to include this to REUNION is that I think that both knew eachother when they were still with their dragons. Igneel shouted just before their fight: ""Let's see how you raised your children, Skyramia, Vice Logia"" or something like that... It doesn't say it directly, but it can meen that Igneel knew the dragons... personaly.

AMNESIA

I don't think this will be very hard to understand. Natsu can not remember Wendy
One day to the other

TIME TRAVEL

The next part are predictions. They have not happend yet. There are a few things we have to know about time travel. Time travel is extreemly dangerous, but it is awesome. I don't know who came up with it, but I don't want any grace for it. I am just here to share it with you. 

What if I told you that Zeref is in fact Romeo
3 things: - Looks. They look a lot like eachother. - Cry, Romeo cried because his big hero was back. - Romeo increase of character. Uuh yes, how to explain... lets say that Romeo at the very beginning of the series was a bit of a dull character. Not important. Right after the timeskip Mashima made Romeo look like the new Natsu of the guild. We might not notice it directly, but Romeo appears a lot in the manga lately. This increasement of ""importantness"" might not be for the sake of ""a new lead character"". I think Mashima is working on making him bigger as character so the transition from little boy into Darklord will be way more shocking.
I can asure you, if he does not joins them, then you can ignore this part ;).

RAVE MASTER...

Why Rave? For the people who don't know, Let-Elfman, ""let gf(don't kow the name &gt;.&gt; shame on me)""- Evergreen. And of course: Haru and Natsu (fun fact: Haru=Spring, Natsu=Summer. In another short story Mashima wrote he had Aki and if I'm right that means Autum or season).
DON'T FORGET PLUE :D!

Not only characters, for like 20 years and she got amnesia. He even brought back the skeleton in the desert which appeard to be noone other than Siegrain (the character Jellal/Mystogan is based on). 

I think
Almost all the questions will be answerd: Zeref, name them. I know some thingys that might help the serie to continue a little longer, like Tartaros, but it won't hold for longer than 1 or 2 arc...


OK GUYS... I am fking tierd right now. It took me about 2 hours to write this thing and it is about 3am ;). I go take a nap. Please let me know what you think of my theories, community! It was a pleasure to tell you guys my theories.

It has been shown that Future Rogue's shadow has the ability to corrupt and control individuals, he was unable to control the dark aura blasts; it wasn't his magic power, it's FR's corruption.

Natsu, Sting, Rogue, and Wendy (and possibly Gray, Yukino, and Erza) will follow FR through the Eclipse Gate, finding a dystopian world where FR dominates the world with his dragons and Dragon Manipulation magic. Natsu meets up and befriends pre-corrupted Zeref. He will also meet up with Igneel and other pro-human dragons.

Natsu and friends enter the Dragon King Festival 400 years ago to overthrow FR. FR kills a lot of pro-human dragons, the **Black** Dragon .of Apocalypse. Current Rogue and Sting also killed a lot of anti-human dragons and drank its blood, effectively turning them into Weisslogia and Skyadrum (which ironically seals their fate as being killed by their younger self 393 years later). Natsu will fight and defeat Acnologia, a feat that will be immortalized in this [picture](http://i.imgur.com/8k8GQp6.png) (notice that the mage is using fire magic *and* has Natsu's scarf. That's Natsu there, foreshadowed.) 

Before his defeat

In order to send the Eclipse FT travelers back into the present, uses his light power to inscribe some prophecy text. His text will be passed down from one guild to another, until it is endowed upon young Mavis. The ancient text is known as Lumen Histoire, or History [written of] Light. The treasure of Fairy Tail.

1359734850.0,17p6ml,Identity of Zeref theory [Spoilers],yellowflasher,32,4,29,"After chapter 317 it occurred to me that there is a possiblity that Rogue is Zeref. 

So what do we already know? 

1) Eclipse. Because of this there is the chance that Rogue could go back in time 400 or so.

2) Zeref knows Natsu. During the Tenrou Island arc Zeref cries when he sees Natsu and hopes that one day he will destroy him. Zeref/Rogue could be thinking this way because Natsu has already beaten him during the games.

3) Their appearances are rather similar. See link below.

[Zeref and Rogue](http://i.imgur.com/eUVZZBS.png)

4) Zeref and Rogue from what we've seen so far appear to be friendly and don't particularly want to harm anyone (I will explain why Zeref is ""evil"" later on).

5) As of chapter 317 Rogues shadow has a personality/power of its own and is wanting to lend its power to Rogue so he can kill Gajeel. Rogue seemed surprised at the shadows sudden appearance

6) The shadow is presumably evil and manipulative. Which is the ""evil"" side of Zeref

So that is my theory so far. I don't think I've missed anything out but if I have I will add it in later.

I know it isn't the best theory but I would love to see your thoughts on this.

1371330079.0,1gf2n7,Speculation about fate of Ultear and Chapter 336.,SplitFireify,38,8,18,"So this is my first time posting to Fairy Tail reddit and i apoligize my English in advance.

In chapter 334 Gray was killed. In chapter 335 it is told that Ultear knew some sort of ancient spell that would turn back time in cost of users life. Ultear felt herself worthless and decided to save everyone by turning time back by few hours

I think that we could think it like she gave one minute of her life to every single people in Fiore.In Fiore there is 17 million inhabitants, so she would have lived to age about 55-60 years old. 

Giving one extra minute to every peoples lifetime which could be though that she rewinded every peoples consciousness back by one minute because everyone knew what had  happened that minute that they had already lived

She also sent her consciousness back in time as she saw the clock showing one minute to half two. So she gave herself one more minute to live before her life time would run out.

So there is three possibilities that could happen in next chapter:

1) Ultear will die and many Ultear fans will be pissed.

2) Meredy uses some kind of advanced sense-link magic and shares her life time with Ultear and saving her.

3) Mashiro come up something that will be totally unpredictable

If the number 2 is right I want say already: Called It!",nsfw,t5_2s9z2,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/fairytail/comments/1gf2n7/speculation_about_fate_of_ultear_and_chapter_336/

Natsu

On year 777, a celestial mages life was taken). For some reason the plan failed, however it did create a portal to 400 years ago. For some reason, the dragons send their children through the portal, perhaps to protect them from opposing dragon herds. When Natsu, Wendy and Gajeel arrived the future, they asked the people in town and been told it was year 777, thus they think their dragon disappeared on this day. bt in fact they were sent 400 years after and arrived on 777

Another theory is that the dragon slayers spent their time with dragon in celestial world. They entered the celestial world with their dragon when young

Either way, suggesting their ""real age"" is significantly higher than they look. Also, Zerefs recognise Natsu, means somehow Zeref already knew him from 400 years ago. ",,False,self,False,t3_1cd9zx

1. I am from Germany so excuse my bad english
2. i hope i can tell you atleast about the feelings i had watching Fairy Tail.


So where do i start? mhm its not easy, it's not only about sorcerers and witches...


It's about having trust in your Friends, never giving up... and actually there is no ending to this list. It feels kinda hard expressing my feelings about this anime, but this anime told me so many things about life and even if the world isn't real, i feel like that the people in this anime are so filled with emotions...


And now i am finished with the existing 175 episodes, they would be: 

1. Believe in your friends  
2. Stand up for your friends if you need to  
3. Though our paths may have diverged, and you must never forget about your friends for as long as you live. And now that the anime is paused, i started learing japanese and drawing manga.


Sorry for this Wall of text haha :)
  

**THANK YOU FAIRY TAIL** for everything you gave to me.... 


May Natsu Dragneel become the strongest Dragon ever!

---

Since we've grown quite a bit

1. The banner must be made by you
2. The banner must be atleast 1920px wide by 200px high.
3. The banner needs to use high quality pictures.
4. If you don't know photoshop or similar program
4. The banner needs to have the cast of fairy tail guide in it.
2. You can use any and all pictures of fairy tail guide members.
5. The banner has to be Safe For Work.
6. The banner needs to be a little boring on the left side about 250pxs. (so to make the fairytail logo easy to see. See the present banner as an example)
7. Best banner wins. 
8. I decide the winner.

If you have any other questions I'll update the text post with an edit.

1. Lisanna. Her death was one of the best character developments in the entire story. It affected so many people, not to mention Mira and Elfman. 
Then they bring her back to life......and it just kills all of that backstory and depth. Seeing her in Edolas was fine. It was almost like an aching of the past. I just can't believe they pulled it out to bring her back and ruin so much of the backstory for these characters. 

2. Jerral. He is/was everywhere. It's' not like his character is bad, Seigrain, and Edolas version who are all characters. ( I know the first two are actually the same person). But I'm talking from a story standpoint, it's like you keep throwing a stray cat outside but it keeps coming back from a different direction. It was cool the first, and even the second time, but after the Oracion Seis arc, it was just too much. It's like that one kid that nobody wanted to pick for dodgeball, backstory

These two provide so much for Natsu and Erza. Gray and Lucy have both experienced this, justice. I feel like it's just trying a little too hard. 

I'd love to hear comments for other sides, just my opinion. ",,False,self,t5_2s9z2,False,,

1358114688.0,16igms,Speculation on where the current Arc is heading (Many Spoilers),Vorgulremik,21,4,7,"After rewatching a few of the previous arc's recently

1) The ""Eclipse"" doorway - basically a time travel device, it is open, and ready to be utilized at any time.

2)Charla's vision - up to this point, but the one regarding Mecurius collapsing with Lucy inside was pretty clear, no other characters were seen to be present, and we almost conveniently have 2 Lucy's at the moment, which would suggest that all of the main characters are free to escape through the doorway, minus one of the Lucy's.

3) Dragonslayers Final form - We now know from the conversation with the Jade dragon, a tail, and eventually growing wings, before becoming a dragon entirely"" as was the case with Achnologia., This transformation occurs when the dragonslayer in question ""bathes in the blood of a dragon"", whether this means hey have to kill the dragon or litterally bathe in its blood we don't know, but the appearance of sting and rogue would imply the latter (unless they are lying about killing their parents)

4) The Spirit World - We know due to that one puzzling episode that time in the spirit world passes over 90x faster than in the real world (3 months = 1 day), instead of over three months, we know that residing in the spirit world the main characters could theoretically live out the 400 year gap if they were to use the eclipse gate, in just over five years, I think it's perfectly plausible that the future Lucy we have seen thus far could be five years older.

5) Freed's runes - way back in the Thunder festival arc where natsu and Gajeel are trapped behind a wall of Freed's runes, everyone else is able to pass through freely.

So that's what we know so far, and still make it back to the present day via the spirit world, this could also explain why the spirits are so comfortable with the idea of bringing the fairy tail bunch into the spirit world, as this would serve as a convenient ""time marker"" for the past characters to disembark into the normal world. This would also be consistent with Freed's runes not allowing Natsu and Gajeel to travel past the ""younger than 80 years only"" barrier, since they would technically be over 400 years old. However, there is one more thing, which stikes me as a bit of a long shot......but

6) Zeref already knows Natsu when they first meet, we see Zeref looking upon the wreckage and muttering ""it's over eh, Natsu?"" and a few seconds later, we see Achnologia retreating into the clouds, what if this comment was directed at the black dragon himself, what if, in an alternate timeline (we know it's possible for the both to exist at once becasue of the double Lucy) for some reason, through the slaying of dragons in the past, I think there was a reason he didn't speak during his siege of Tenroujima

Another wild theory, and we have been told numerous times that ""dragon slayer magic is identical to the dragons own magic"", it could be possible that Natsu / Gajeel / Wendy, ARE Igneel, Metallicana, Grandine, they become their dragon counterparts fighting in the war, and either teach their young selves

Again I stress

TLDNR; - I compare a few points people may have forgot about / overlooked and use it to take a wild stab in the dark and suggest that Natsu may be Achnologia / young Igneel.

Just a quick definition of each type of Dragon Slayer.

* First-Generation or ""Old-Style"" (Learned from a Dragon)
* Second-Generation (""Learned"" from implanting Dragon Lacrima)
* Third-Generation (Learned from a Dragon and has had Dragon Lacrima implanted into their body) 

*Although it is stated that Sting and Rogue have killed their dragons

.. And I apologize in advance for my TL;DR's that may actually require TL;DR's of their own.

In terms of power, two First-Gen's, wiped the floor with Sting and Rogue, two Third-Gen's, while only sustaining minor injuries.

**TL;DR Potential Power Levels: First-Gen = Third-Gen &gt; Second-Gen**

Although in terms of Dragon Slayer abilities/capabilities it seems that Third-Gen's have easier access to some skills. Sting and Rogue have been shown to be able to effortlessly activate two powers

**TL;DR Third-Gen's seem to have more (ease of access to) Dragon slayer capabilities than First-Gen's/Second-Gen's**

I have a feeling that Sting and Rogue's ability to activate a ""Drive"" and Dragon Force is because of their implanted Dragon Lacrima. It has been shown that Second-Gen's

With that in mind

**TL;DR Dragon Lacrima augments a person's Dragon Slayer magic, ""Drive"" abilities and truer forms of Dragon Force than that of Second-Gen's.**

But I'm also leaning towards the idea that Sting and Rogue's forms of Dragon Force are still not as strong as that of Natsu when he consumed the Etherion and The Flame of Rebuke. I'm thinking that those substances enhanced Natsu's power, or any other Dragon Slayer, is able to activate Dragon Force of their own will, it will be on par with Natsu's Etherion/Flame of Rebuke Dragon Force, if not better. Probably better.

**TL;DR Etherion/Flame of Rebuke boosted Natsu to ACHIEVING the truest form of Dragon Force to date.**

But a good amount of that is simple speculation

**Super TL;DR The type of Dragon Force Natsu initiated is still probably the most powerful one to date.**

2) He is evil and powerful

3) He wanders the world and ends up in the Island

4) GH and FT fight on the island

I remember him saying something about not being able to control his death magic if he values human life, he would be thankful for having GH taking away the random explosions of death magic.

First
There are 2 kinds of guilds, Lamia Scale, Mermaid Heel, **Sabertooth** etc. are Light guilds, or Guilds approved by the council. 

Dark Guilds: Eisenwalt, etc...
(NOT Phantom Lord

Dark Guilds are Guilds who are not accepted by the council. They are like criminal organizations (in the eyes of the council). Dark Guilds are not just free roaming guilds and can't do whatever they like. 

The Balam Aliance controles them. A [picture](http://imgur.com/orDi8) Reedus drew is explaining the ""status"" of the Dark Guilds. 
Each Dark Guild is controled by one of the 3 Balam Aliance Guilds.

-Oracion Seis

-Girmore Heart

-Tartaros

Oracion Seis has been defeated by the Light Team (Nirvana Arc)

Girmore Heart has been defeated by the top members of Fairy Tail. (Tenrou Island Arc)

Tartaros... Where is Tartaros?

My theory:
Tartaros has already made an appearence. Not officialy by name
I think they might have Infiltrated Sabertooth. 
Sabertooth might be a Light Guild (yes guys, but don't you think it is odd, that right after Fairy Tail (the strongest guild in Fiore) disappeard, Sabertooth appeard out of nowhere. Their Master Jiemma is a brute master who don't even care about his own members, just like a Dark Guilds master. 


What I'm saying here does not mean that all of the members of Sabertooth KNOW that they are *infiltrated* by Tartaros. I even think that Sting and Rough have no idea about this either. They just want status and Jiemma told them probably

Tartaros, so they decided to ""dissapear"" and try to ""take over the world"" (or whatever their intension is) in a legal way.

So the wall art of the dragon king festival. It shows a man wearing a similar scarf to Natsu fighting a dragon. My theory is that this is Igneel as a dragon slayer

This really just popped into my head and I felt the need to share and see what others think.

**Edit:** OK after reading the manga again we are told Zeref is responsible for the Dragon transforming. I still think I'm right Only now I believe Igneel didn't murder countless dragons to transform. I'd say he used his own magic to mimic Zeref's and as he didn't want to transform another human he just used himself. Further more I think Natsu may actually be Igneel's real son.

Something i have observed is that Lucy's powers are kind of similar to jellals as they deal with ""comsic"" stuff. Jellal deals with constalations and meteors and shit while lucy has the horoscope stuff as well as that ""Urano Metria"" spell that has something to do with planets. So i was thinking could there be more GATES or KEYS lucy could get that would be equal in strength to the twelve zodiac keys? 

I was thinking there could be keys that unlocked weapons so basically lucy could bring out Taurus and then open up a weapon gate so instead of him using his big axe he would use whatever weapon she summoned like a mystical sword or some shit. Or could we possibly see a chinease zodiac soon with Dragon, ram and all those other ones that kind of go AGAINST the traditional zodiacs and then lucy somehow brings them together. Almost like some sort of seperation in the spirit world. I dunno. 

TL;DR i just want to know how you think lucy's powers will develop after she gets all 13 celestial spirits. I know she uses dual casting to summon two but after she gets all 13 is that it for her in terms of growth? what do you think.

I mean something that really gave depth to Natsu was that he had experienced loss

Then as he meets her again he is, all his other friends in the guild being in trouble, etc, etc) which is all good.

But at the end of the arc when she shows herself and explain that she is actually the Earthland Lisanna he seems kinda excited ofcourse to have her back but only a little. He actually seems more surprised than excited. 

It's like she's this huge important person which has influenced his life so deeply came back and then she becomes this background character like Levy

There were some romantic implications too that I don't really feel like they dealt with. 

I mean Wendy has a bigger role and she's kinda new to Fairy Tail. Don't get me wrong I like Wendy but I feel like considering Lisannas importance to the main character (Natsu) she would have a bigger role over all.

I think that we need to either:

2. Get more mods (I don't really see this happening)

3. Complain/riot/ask the active mods what we should do.

4. Get a kick starter for the sub

5. Get more people from the anime/manga subs to watch FairyTail and join us.

__________________________________________________________________

Name: Scott Grind (19)

Bio: raised by my grandfather in a small town he taught me how to build all sorts of contraptions due to him being an inventor but by the age of six i had drawn the attention of the magic council with my own inventions

Guild: Lamia Scale but wanting to join the regrouped Fairy Tail

Magic Type: Light Molding Magic Quick magic explanation: my creation magic differs from others in several key points the first being that it needs light to work because I'm taking the light away from the source to create the objects example if i used my magic using a fire as the source the fire itself would stop giving off light (but still have its other quality like heat) until my spell is broken or i lose consciousness. Second the strength of my spells is based off the amount of light i use in it. third i don't have to use all of the light from one source at once i could say only take half the light making the source 50% as bright then i could take more from it later for another spell. note my spells don't generate light they are a bright gold color and can be seen clearly in all or no light.

Equipment: goggles that allow me to see light sources better(how they look http://challenger70ta.deviantart.com/art/Steampunk-Goggles-182486137 ), my grandfathers pocket watch( how it looks http://travelogue.travelvice.com/postfiles/2007-05-07_antique-pocket-watch-back.jpg ) and an old wrench ( http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3055/2833574999_cacff9503e.jpg used to fight)

Spells: 

1. light-make Rivet it has the same functionality as ice-make lance http://fairytail.wikia.com/wiki/Ice-Make:_Lance 

2. light-make Box simiar to ice-make block but created around myself or objects http://fairytail.wikia.com/wiki/Ice-Make:_Block 

3. o.c. light-make piston I create a piston out of light to crush

4. o.c. light-make gears I create up to 10 spinning gears that can connect to each other to spin faster increasing their strength 

5. o.c. light-make golems i create 2 man size golems that assist me they are slightly weaker then me however they can use my magic (not this spell) but it drains my power and has the same effects to the surroundings as mine (I know what they see)

Trump: Dark Light: after i have used all the light or it has all been taken away by a spell i start to use my Lacrima to quickly generate my own temporary light sources to fight the flash ones for a quick powerful strike and the flares to be used over time.

Weakness: no light means no more spells

Stats: 

Stability:2 

Speed:2 

Intelligence:9 

Magic Reserves:7

So

Erza mentioned in 280

""There was someone like that here
However
""I didn't think there was somebody like that"" -- along these lines

As Erza is getting her butt kicked she says
""i'm surprised

Now, it's gotta be something more...
I think she is taking note of Kagura's power coming from her need for vengeance for Simon.

We're close to my conclusion


Erza doesn't say that about Kagura when Milliana tells her about the sword.. she said it both before and after Milliana mentioned it. Because Erza says this before Milliana

Not only do I think Erza recognizes the blade
I think Erza is surprised somebody could wield that sword so often

To this point

However, as to make sure Archenemy did not lose significance.  Erza wants revenge, and has enough resentment at the moment to wield archenemy.

Let me know what you think

Even if i'm wrong

My full opinion about her: Her story is acctualy pretty good. Lisanna is Natsu his childhood girlfriend. They raised Happy and they were a couple (not official, something he never could and eventualy ment the death of Lisanna. If something changed for Natsu... No not realy, but we never got into Natsu, after the Lisanna story, so I leave this open.

When Lisanna came back, that changed for the characters.**

We all though, I realy mean NOTHING happend between them. The only thing Lisanna said about Natsu was against Lucy: When Natsu is surounded by friends, he will get much stronger. (or something like that).

So the question to you: Is the whole character Lisanna a plot making character or compleetly useless? Like I said, because she still has a lot of potential for future arcs. And Useless, because her addition after Edolas is less then 0. I think she is damn lucky to be chosen by Juvia as her partner and being part of the time skip.

1345275273.0,yf5b8,Yet another theory about the Dragon Slayers and Zeref.,Hoali,18,6,10,"Sorry for the length.

I was going back through and watching some of the anime. I watched the episode in the Tenroujima arc where Carla and Happy destroy Hades' heart. So here's my theory:

If Hades needs the heart to perform his magic, another question needs to be answered. If he does indeed have an external heart, where is it? Which, theoretically, would be easy to answer. Acnologia. Acnologia is the source of Zeref's power. Now I know that most would have come to this conclusion already, but it bears repeating. Because the next logical step from said assumptions is that if Acnologia, a dragon, does that mean that the other dragons are sources of power themselves? Also

A couple of pieces of evidence to support this is that Zeref seems to know where Acnologia is, they both seem to occupy the same general role as apocalyptic chaos starter. They both tend to destroy whatever they come in contact with, Acnologia for shits and giggles and Zeref because he's upset. A bit weak I admit, but it still makes sense.

While I realize that most of this is based on assumptions, it makes sense that they have longer lives due to their hearts. It doesn't account for the apparent amnesia however. It could be that the dragons caused the amnesia in their respective ""children"". Amnesia, of course, referring to the fact that none of the known dragon slayers, outside of Rogue and Sting, seem to remember having interactions with the others before the current timeline in the manga/anime.

I had one more thought about the heart linking, of the individual hearts that dictates the powers received by the wizard being linked to them. The Dragon Slayers, once linked to their respective ""parents"", were given the powers associated with the type of dragon they are. This would lend credibility to the claim that Zeref is in fact a Dragon Slayer. Acnologia is pretty much the harbinger of death and Zeref uses Death Magic. But this begs the question: How did Hades make a heart and why did it give him the powers it did? My theory is Hades found out about the link between the dragons and their slayers and went about finding the magic to create a heart of his own. And while making the heart, he was able to program it with the magics that he wanted to use. 

Again, rebuttals, questions, things I've missed. It's all welcome. Cheers.

Also

I wanted to add something that is based off the above theory with regards to Gen 3 Slayers such as Sting and Rogue. If the above theory and Sting's and Rogue's claims about killing their ""parents"" are accurate then where is their magic coming from? Why do Sting and Rogue still have Dragon Slayer powers if their hearts no longer beat? I think it's the lacrima that were embedded in their bodies. The lacrima are substitutes for the hearts. Which would give a somewhat better explanation regarding Gen 2 Slayers. An explanation that goes beyond they just have lacrima in them so it works. It gives it a bit more depth. This would also kind of explain why they're able to control Dragon Force. They're in control of their ""hearts"", it seems to fit and the clues are there, though I may have stretched them a bit too far. Time will tell I suppose.

[Having since read the most recent manga I feel that at least some of what was written above may not be correct. It has been alluded that Sting and Rogue may not have actually killed their dragons, remains valid. It could possibly boost the connection with their hearts, giving them the ability to enter Dragon Force at will.](/manga)

Instead what if they all just entered this door :l   So basically they didn't disappeared they just traveled to this moment in time. 

Now if its played right they here's what could happen.


The dragons come out and a select group of  others are drawn in. So natsu, they tell the story in the past of natsu and the others. Natsu would be adventurin around trying to find out how to get back to the future...or trying to stop Zeref? In this process he meets himself as a child and is confused. This could reveal that he and the other dragon slayers were actually alive back then and were just ported to the future.

This most likely is not how it will turn out because of the part of the series where the dragons say- ""Maybe natsu and Wendy will get along this time.""... also when Natsu and Wendy first meet

I'll start: I would use a magic called assassin magic. Examples: Camoflauge, Re-Equip: Blodd-Thirsty Katana, Silence, and Darkness. I would probebly be in the assassin Guild and be a S-rank wizard. My dream would be to assaninate a Consol Member and become the Guild Master. My most used spells would be Camoflauge (to sneak around and to be an assassin), Re-equip: Blood-Thirsty Katana (so that I could have a stong weapon), and Wood Dummy (to dodge attacks). I would mostly be alone so that I dont get caught so easily but sometimes work in a small group of 3. I would be weeak against nothing (can't think of anything). I would be strong against nothing (can't think of anything). I would look kind of bland with the stariotypical face mask with black eyes and my body will be clothed in all black and the color of my skin would be Natsu's skin. Nothing will get in the way of my dream, NOTHING.

1340909108.0,vr5ix,Just a re-post of my Theory to help you all with yours. ,Crusnik909,16,3,2,"I'm seeing a lot of theory and prediction threads about how God Slayers


I posted this comment on /user/Theroy thread http://www.reddit.com/r/fairytail/comments/vg3i4/lost_magic_and_zeref_spoilers_288/


That's the closest idea I have as to what Zeref


""Okay here's my input of what the Dragon Slayers happen to be. So we know Achnologia is at known as a Ancient Legend and the destroyer of worlds. He happens to be a black Dragon that takes life. We know at least three names of other dragons. Igneel being one of the. Know from Chapter 101 (http://www.mangastream.to/fairy-tail-chapter-101-page-7.html) we know that Grandine visited Igneel. Igneel said that he had Forbidden all interference (probably talking about contacting their kids). Grandine said Natsu was reckless like Igneel. That Wendy would meet Natsu and that Zeref coming back could not be avoided. We also know that Igneel got enraged by Grandine and asked if she really wanted to ""anger him."" That's when Grandine said that she ""Looks forward to seeing him again in the Dragon King Feast.""

Now looking at that conversation we can guess that Igneel has some superiority over the other Dragons. Maybe even over or equal to Achnologia. We know that Achnologia is feared and known in the history of the manga but we have no idea why he disappeared. We also know that Zeref was feared 400 years ago. And as OP states that Natsu is older than 80, Achnologia and Zeref are weekend and go into seperate hiding. Zeref runs from Achnologia as to keep him from competing in the next Feast. Igneel makes a knew rule saying ""No interference with humans until the next Feast"" but humans striving for power start researching Zeref and God Slayers making Achnologia and Zeref stronger. Now Zeref and Achnologia have returned and are ready for the next Dragon King Feast.

This is just me guessing though.""


Again this is just me saying what I think to all of your theory and prediction threads.

1338093124.0,u6wyv,[Events at the end of the Magic Tournament]/manga,jojomanjm,12,2,13,"As those who have been reading the scanlations of Fairy Tail

There are several events that are expected to happen:
1. the ""eclipse""
2. the Dragon king feast.  This is not actually stated , Gazeel and Wendy from Fairy Tail, Rogue and Sting from Sabertoothe).  Zeref is potentially a dragonslayer, or at least falls under that general category from the chapters that showed the dragon Acnologia at the end of the Fairy tale/ Grimoire Heart storyline, and the conversation between the sky dragon Grandine and the fire dragon Igneel in chapter 101.

read fairy tale ch. 101: http://www.mangareader.net/135-7216-1/fairy-tail/chapter-101.html

The first event is pretty clear about the stellar mage dying, it is made clear that Zeref never died, just went to ""sleep"").  I noticed the second by me being bored during summer break and rereading all of Rave and Fairy Tale (which is pretty much the rave characters put into a different storyline.  Seriously, just look at the similarities between Lucy and Resha/Elie, and Sieghart and Sieghart/Gerard/Mistgun) 

In chapter 101 of Fairy Tale

I think that the eclipse is the start of the dragon king feast, although I'm not sure how this will work for Sting and Rogue who supposedly killed the dragons who taught them dragon slaying magic.

It is also clear that the exceed cats (Happy and the other cats with wings) have some sort of attraction to dragon slayers

I'd like to extend an offer to /r/fairytail for you all to join my Fairy Tail RP Forum. We're (currently) rather small

It is the year X224. The Age of Technology has ended. As constant war split apart the world there was only one destination for History and that was into destruction. Peace settled over the land as scholars turned to the Arcane rather than the Mechanical. Technology retired and Magic took over. The study of Magic is still in its adolescence, whether they are official and play by the rules of the Council or make their own rules designates them as Guilds of Light or Darkness. Throughout the constant struggle between official and mercenary Guilds, the Dragons watch over the land, their ancient powers sometimes slipping into play. 

In the midst of the politics, where will you be? Will you take up a sword as a Rune Knight, a peacekeeper and enforcer of the Law of Fiore? Will you join an official, or an unofficial, guild to be a shaper of the World with Magic at your fingertips? Or maybe you will be one of the mystical Dragon Slayers, who wield the might of the most ancient of beasts at will. At Wings of Fairy Tail, an intermediate to advanced longhand roleplaying site, quite literally

If you're unsure about wanting to join us, and the quality of your character, not by the roll of a die. We have a detailed stat system in place that helps roleplayers understand the various strengths and weaknesses of other characters without being too restrictive on creativity. This roleplay is set in an AU, and while that means you don't get to interact with the canon characters, that also means some really powerful magic types are up for grabs.",,False,t5_2s9z2,True

After watching the new fairy tail episode I began to wonder about take over magic. Up until now I always thought that in order to gain a new 'soul' a person had to encounter it

So then I began to wonder

I went and researched around wikipedia and it didn't really specify anything at all besides the fact that Elfman had to encounter beasts in order to transform into them. Nothing about Lisana or Mirajane

According to my friend in the Manga it says something along the lines of Mirajane already having Satan Souls within her but she discovers them through training or something.. Can anyone clarify?

[More information regarding Zeref if you wanna brush up.](http://fairytail.wikia.com/wiki/Zeref#Tenrou_Island_arc)

Here are some interesting quotes from the wiki article above:

""At some time in the past

""Zeref was shocked to see Natsu and says that he has ""really grown"", landing a fierce blow to Zeref's face.""

""Just then his [Zeref's] Magic activates again but no one is killed

""As he walks he states that he had no reason to come to this age

""He blames Grimoire Heart for the summoning of Acnologia

""Zeref then realizes mankind will be 'embarking on a long journey again', Zeref shuts his eyes, and comes to realize that it was finally over for Natsu, as the damaged airship keeps flying along.""

From Natsu's article:

""Igneel's Scarf: It is a scarf given to Natsu by his foster father, but the exposure to the death Magic caused it turn black. During the time it was tainted, Wendy was unable to heal Natsu. In order to heal him, she had to reverse and remove the evil on the scarf.""

-------

So what I'm primarily looking for here are somewhat wild (or not) speculations. It'd be funny if someone called whatever it is that is happening with the dragons, Zeref, Natsu, these ""ages"", etc; now. If we keep guessing, at least someone will be right, right?

My guess is that the dragon slayers are reborn continuously. Zeref

But the question then also becomes why he was only mentioning Natsu

And then the princess was originally portrayed as wanting to save Arcadios, is also being very secrative. She did not arrive on the fourth! And FL also has told the Princess how Eclipse 2 can be used in destructive ways. So, FL either has an alternative plan, or is not FL at all.

Remember, and he followed her, and almost lost here. So that could mean, A, the intense power of Eclipse/Eclipse 2 is actually a very dark magic, and it lingered on FL after she uesd it. Or B, FL uses a dark and evil magic which is NOT Lucy's.

TL;DR: Future Lucy is either a really evil, and it changed her view on everything, and now she's being secretive about it.

Also, brightness or whatever). Leaving only black substances. (Darkness and Shadows.) While Rogue eats the shadows/darkness, leaving only light. So could it be swapped around? Meaning Sting is more of an evil person, while Rogue is more friendly? This is also hinted at when Sting felt no remorse for Yukino leaving, while Rogue was a little put off by it. And Sting also went absolutely insane when it came to wanting to fight Natsu, and after Rogue's match with Gajeel, he didn't seem have the insane urge to do it anymore.

So we can see that Mavis does know about the Dragon Slayers and their powers. What is her connection to them? Did she have dragon slayers in Fairy Tail during her time as Guild Master? Why is she put to the test? Is any of this related to [Lumen Histoire?](http://fairytail.wikia.com/wiki/Lumen_Histoire)

**EDIT:** Ok it's been pointed out that there could be a translation error. [This](http://imgur.com/9gfAz) is the same panel from Manga Inn while my earlier link was from Manga Reader.

This could possibly be backed up during the Battle of Fairy Tail arc when the dragon slayers can't get past the barrier and then Igneel and Grandine are talking about Natsu and Wendy getting along ""this time"" which suggests they have met before.

TL;DR Dragon slayer aren't human 

I know it is a very short theory and poorly supported but this is the best I can do at the moment. I would love to hear your thoughts on this.
