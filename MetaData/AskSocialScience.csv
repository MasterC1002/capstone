1359313477.0,17dp3p,Social science is not crystal ball reading. The failure of the moderators to do their jobs makes a mockery of this subreddit.,chaim-the-eez,531,110,101,"Please. Social scientists cannot predict the future or describe alternative realities. We don't read portents in bird entrails or tea leaves. We can't know what would happen if Russia had turned into a balloon in 1974 or if everyone suddenly thought that tables were rabbits or anything else that people just make up. 

Science is about things that are real. We should be citing research or at least established theory and saying that we don't know and why. 

This is not /r/ArmchairPhilosophy.

It is bad enough that the moderators allow top-level comments filled with speculation, contrary to stated policies. But retaining ridiculous posts is the icing on the cake.

**User xrxx wrote:**    
Hey I know you are prbly a super open-minded enlighted tolerant librul and everything but maybe you could stop censoring posts from this subreddit just because they disagree with your ideology.

**Response:**    
A statement like ""you never see a smart black"" isn't a matter of politics or left or right leaning ideology.  It is a statement of fact and not opinion, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, so he can't be too dull witted. 

I don't mean to knock those who responded to your post, engineering, economics, programming, and the whole rest of science and design. There are plenty of examples in all of these fields. Take your pick. If you want to pretend that you understand stellar and galactic mechanics better than N D Tyson then be my guest, but I suspect that neither of us do or probably ever will. If you have any mathematical theorems named after you, then I'd certainly be interested to discuss them

It is important for science to be open minded. Scientists should never let things like politics or tradition limit their thinking

But this wasn't the question; it was **why** there are differences. This tells me that you have already found the answer to your question and are simply looking for others to find reasons to back up your preconceptions. That's not how science works. It's inappropriate in the same way that the question ""**Why** is Spearman's Rho the best method of statistical analysis?"" is

I don't have any problems discussing scientific questions of a sensitive political or social nature and neither should the other mods so long as they're worth their salt. Racial inequality, gun ownership, fiscal conservatism, social welfare, free market capitalism, so on and so forth... are all real issues that have real impact on ourselves and our society. As such, they are quite worthy of study and discussion. But that discussion has to start with the right questions. Not that they can't be questions that are controversial or that make us uncomfortable; that's perfectly fine. But they have to be honest questions looking for honest answers, it isn't how science works

I used Sweden since that's what I know. I used ""plethoric"" after checking its meaning (insert Princess Bride movie reference). I'm mostly concerned about small-scale pervasive and expected bribery in Russia, Afghanistan, and such. Plus of course the greatest con currently in progress, the fact that it takes so much money to get elected in the US that you have to get money from corporations and special interests to pay for the TV election ads that the very busy, 20-second-attention-span American people will pay attention to, so you end up having to write legislation to please the people with the money. But that's a minor issue.

The real issue is how to get the rest of the world out of the small-scale bribery mire. I'm hoping facebook, electronic payments and websites like I Paid A Bribe http://www.ipaidabribe.com/ and others will super-fast track the process that I'm hoping r/askhistorians can explain to me. See http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/07/business/web-sites-shine-light-on-petty-bribery-worldwide.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0

Edit: I admittedly don't have massive evidence that Sweden used to be mired in bribery, a very (until recently) ethnically homogeneous society of a few million people with natural borders and a history of subservience to authority and premium pride paid to academic/scientific achievement, is not terribly easy to relate to the countries with the current problems.

So I'm a graduate student in economics, and time-series econometrics. My areas of specific expertise are in monetary theory and policy, but I have a pretty wide background in all areas of macro. Beyond academia, I've done short stints in Washington, DC, working on primary statistics for the US government (think BEA, BLS

User Jericho_Hill and I go back a ways

I know there are two or three people who I've already promised answers to on certain topics. I'm hoping they will show up in this thread.

**Subject Matter**

To get you started

* Macroeconomics (growth, ...)
* Economic policy
* The Federal Reserve
* Econometrics
* Pedagogy in macro/economics in general
* ""The state of economics"" post-crisis
* The history of macroeconomics
* Some of the short-term trends in the US economy (the recent recession)
* Some of the medium-term trends in the US  (the productivity slowdown
* Some of the long-term trends in the Western economies (the Industrial Revolution
* My own views on macro policy
* Data collection and life at BLS
* Grad student life in economics!
* Life advice for undergrads!
* Life advice for undergrads
* Silly stuff
* League of Legends stuff
* Other things as they come up

**House rules**

1. **One topic I'd like not to touch on here too much is international macro.** I'm willing to field questions about the Euro, and plan on holding an international macro AMA in May. If you can save international questions until then, you'll probably get better answers. This one will by necessity be more US-centric.
1. I'll try to answer from about as mainstream of a position as I can. Where my own views depart significantly from the mainstream
2. I'll be answering in as neutral
3. Other economists may feel free to chime in
4. Economics
5. Be excellent to each other.

1361723910.0,194y32,Are there empirical studies that show a positive correlation between low taxes on the super rich and increased investments in real economy?,Ekvilibrist,96,10,30,"In January

They couldn't find any positive correlation between increased income among the top 1% and increased investment in the real economy

Edit for clarity:

What the study found was this: gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of GDP has decreased in the last thirty years. This is despite the fact that tax policies during the same period have given the top 1% a bigger share of the income and the stock market index has increased considerably. They ought to have been able to increase their investments not only in the financial sector

I'm a bit unsure as to exactly how accurate ""gross fixed capital formations"" is as a measurement of ""investment in a real economy"" is
 
I liked the fact that this study was not just a model based on assumptions

Are there any good opposing studies done recently that support the idea that low taxes on the super rich (or alternatively: just having richer rich people) lead to increased investments in the real economy?

Edit: here's the most succinct chart they used
It's top 1% income share share of GDP on the x axis and investment share of GDP on the Y axis for 14 OECD countries between 1970 and 2008.

One of the most frequent Reddit TIL posts

My problem with the second part of this analysis is the near-complete lack of evidence which goes with it. Clearly, high prices. This is really no different from any other luxury good and is pretty basic economics, and in this sense, the idea that Diamonds are a ""scam"" seems somewhat ridiculous, as, regardless of the origin of the demand, clearly there is big demand for them.

So now we move to supply. Where is the evidence for a massive over-supply of diamonds? I certainly can't find much in the way of substantive evidence

That being said, not in jewelry grade diamonds. The two are completely separate and thus this is pretty weak evidence for price-fixing in the jewelry market. 

Top-quality jewelry grade diamonds are, once again, these sources are fairly weak. I can't find any substantive evidence for their being a large over-supply of these types of diamonds.

There is clearly a mark-up on diamonds when they are sold at retail, and it's something created by the natural forces of demand and supply.

So really, so pointing fingers at them seems fruitless. Even if DeBeers were doing shady things previously, their lack of influence now would mean that the modern price of diamonds (which is still remarkably high) is a product of market forces.

I tried finding information about this and could only find loads of information about relationships with boyfriend/girlfriend or wife/husband. A wall of text background:

The reason I'm posting this is that my girlfriend and her 4 siblings used to be beaten badly by their mother when they were kids. Some times it went as far as they got strangled

The abuse was not only physical but she would call her daughters whores and that they disgusted her, that they weren't her daughters etc. They eventually moved out one by one and last weekend the son moved out because he was finally fed up. Before moving out she would do nothing but yell and complain at him (and the other daughters as well, the physical abuse stopped when they grew old enough to defend themselves). After the son moved out she called my girlfriend, crying that she had no one. Quick analysis says that she finally realised that she had pushed everyone around her away and now she would live and die alone. My girlfriend feels sorry for her and has tried to help her throughout all the years, to make sure that she gets to her twice a week dialysis which she doesn't want to go to even though she knows that she'll die if she don't.

- Unbalanced aggregate demand: Can an economy really survive with such low ratios of consumer spending and imports?
- (Unsustainable?) growth - up to 10% per year for many years running. Surely there will be a point where expansion hits its nadir and the bond rate (do they even have bonds?) plummets like we've seen in Western countries in recent years
- Massive economic inequality - I believe China is one of the world leaders in Gini scores. Okay - maybe their economy isn't based on consumer spending, especially in regard to potential revolution.
- Eventually likely to run out of labour force participants to stop expansion. 
- Long term problems: Ageing population, technology likely to replace manual labour which China has relied upon, environmental problems, reliance on dollar in currency fixing, potential fall out with trading partners over authoritarian policies (eg rare earth ban).

To me, overspecialisation of economy. I can only see the other two BRICs and the countries of the middle east falling foul of the Singer–Prebisch thesis because of their reliance on raw materials and the MIST countries are barely large enough to take the combined power of the EU and US on.

Even with unreliable,000 people per year, assuming no one under the age of 18 is raped (the survey only sampled adults). Honduras has a homicide rate about 20 times higher than that of the United States, so if the rape rate followed the same ratio it would be 74 per 1,000 people per year (implausibly high - multiplying it by Honduras's life expectancy gives a back-of-the-envelope estimate that the mean person is raped over 5 times in a lifetime). While the article doesn't break down rape incidence rates by race and gender simultaneously, it does give lifetime victimization rates, which don't differ as much as the homicide victimization rates (the lowest male rate that didn't suffer from small sample size was 2.8% for whites, compared to the highest female rate of 34.1% for American Indians and Alaska Natives).

I'm curious how much of our turn-ons and desires and attitudes towards sex are social

&gt; Another clue to the monks' attitude to women is provided by the writings of Robert Curzon, and thereafter been brought up by the monks. This experience meant the man had spent all his life in Athos, and therefore had no idea what women looked like. The only idea of the female body that the man possessed was derived from icons of the Blessed Virgin. Perhaps that is why the man asked Curzon if all women had haloes.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/jun/17/gender.uk

&gt; Another experiment with monkeys who were brought up without mothers found them lacking in maternal behavior toward their own offspring. A similar study showed that monkeys brought up without other monkeys of the opposite sex had no interest in mating-all of which suggests that both mothering and mating behavior are learned

http://jackiewhiting.net/collab/exploratory/motherhood.htm

What kind of effect do you think it would have on a person's sexuality to be isolated from the opposite sex? Would it affect someone's orientation? Would it change how strong their sex drive is?

Would a straight man who had never seen a woman before get erect if he saw a naked woman as an adult?

Would he want to have sex with her?

Would he be turned on by or interested in the sight and smell of her sexual organs?

Would he instinctively know how intercourse worked?

He'd probably figure out that rubbing his sex organs felt good. Would he think about any fantasies while he did so? Would he come up with the idea of a female body without ever seeing one?

Would he be more likely to be attracted to men

What if he were gay? Would he grow up thinking that everyone was gay? Would he think that was the only way things could be?

And same questions for a woman who had never seen men before.

1348573641.0,10g1ih,Will the children born today write by hand and own (physical) books when they grow up?,TheSilverLining,55,16,27,"So

- Children born today won't really learn to write by hand
- Amongst children born today having one bookcase full with books in your home when you are in your 20s-30s will be a rarity. 
- Public libraries will disappear rather rapidly because no-one will read printed books anymore but simply use electronic readers.

Now


Although I do think that electronic readers and the like will have a big impact on people's reading habits

- Technology changes things

- Electronics of this sort are only affordable (or at least, many people depending wholly or partially on ""old school"" pen and paper, and it seems to be that a complete switch would only be plausible if it effected an entire society. I feel that affordability will remain an issue for quite some time, even if prices are bound to decrease gradually.

- Electricity is fickle. My own country has very stable electricity and generally good internet coverage, it's still likely that people would occasionally end up in situations were scribbling something on a piece of paper will be the best/only way of leaving someone a message or retaining information or a reminder to yourself.

- It seems to me that most kids are introduced to pens/pencils not by writing but by drawing! Although drawing on electronic mediums can be fun for users of all ages, even while drawing on a tablet, most people (in my experience anyway) still use a stylus which, let's face it, is basically a pen so even a child growing up in a crayon-free house would be somewhat accustomed to the mechanics of working a pen/pencil.

- Practicality/durability. Tablets and the like can probably be great tools for learning and entertainment for kids, I think it would need to be possible to be used without parental supervision or perhaps rather, with intermittent parental supervision. Although electronics seems to gradually be getting more durable, I have a feeling that it'll be a long time before a tablet can be drooled on, dropped, bitten, flung across the room

- And, they would still have parents, relatives, teachers, bosses etc who were doing it and chances are that would mean that they would've learned to do it too. For this reason, if non-electronic text ever falls completely out of fashion, I think it will take a lot longer than the time it'll take for children being born today to grow up.



Okay, if so, what sort of time-span are we talking about here? Really I'm just curious about the topic in general, whether any studies have been made on it so far and what the predictions of those in relevant fields are on the topic?

It seems to me, our societies seem to be built around the certainty that our economies, our populations and our resources will keep on growing in the future.

For example, and those 4 will need 8 workers, etc., meaning that this system works as long as the population grows. (The actual rate seems to be closer to 3:1 in the US.)


I just don't understand. How is this not a system that is doomed to fail when it stops growing
Is an economy with zero growth sustainable? If so

1338387358.0,uc49w,"I live between two cultures and recently tried to explain to a friend why Eastern European women to him (and many other West men&amp;women) appear to be ""sluts"" and he did not understand a word I was saying. Let's talk human sexual behavior.",lekotar,68,24,79,"This post might be a bit simplistic but I'd like to hear the opinions of people with more than simplistic knowledge in the matter. I'm from Eastern Europe (EE) but I live in Western Europe (WE). Living between the two culturally similar but often times very different entities has given me a lot of room to compare and maybe have a more intricate level of understanding of the cultures.

For those who do not know there's a stereotype that women from EE are a lot more promiscuous than WE women. It's a very persistent stereotype throughout both cultural circles with some EE people taking pride on some level and others using it as self-criticism.

A WE friend of mine recently made a comment about an EE girl we know as being ""pretty hot but a total slut"". I know her and her friends and I've been going out with them quite a lot and I never got the impression of her being ""morally loose and cheaply promiscuous"". What I tried to explain to him was that for me it was behavior within what could be considered normal for a 22 year old in the context of people engaging in clubbing. I tried to dwell deeper into how I understand it:

She is acting out her own sexuality the same freaking way anyone with a sexuality is. She is very much above average attractive and confident and she shows it - that is her sexuality

His theory was I couldn't see it because I'm also from EE but she probably sleeps with anyone willing to. I know this is not true first hand[.](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/003/619/Untitled-1.jpg) She might be dressed in revealing outfits and sometimes dance in a very erotic way

After this he thought I'm calling him out as a bigoted sexist and blamed me of being too political.

Could I be right? Aren't we all trying to show off our attractiveness and act out our sexuality?

I was prompted to post this after reading a comment  by a flared user that was completely devoid of any semblance of scholarly integrity

I have a Bachelors degree in a social science field and I do not feel qualified to answer some of the questions that are pertinent to my field

I'm not asking for a CV on the sidebar or a photocopy of a diploma or anything too extreme (I'm sure the mods have a good success rate at weeding out the frauds who apply for verification).  But I would like to see at least a bit of background info so I can know what kind of experience the person has in the field that my question pertains to.   

I'm not asking for anything that would help to identify people in real life.  

I would like to see what kind of qualifications experts have on the issues and who exactly is equipped to be answering specific questions.  I think there is a huge difference between someone flared in anthropology who has a PhD in the field and someone with the same anthropology flair who graduated with a BA and now works in the private sector.  I'm not saying that one is necessarily better than the other, I'm going to be far more inclined to listen to the person with the PhD who has undoubtedly spent their adult life familiarizing themselves with the extant literature.  

I feel that this subreddit has the potential to be a refuge from the inanity of r/politics, well-articulated and well-cited responses to questions, and I think it's unfair that they are lumped in with those who make posts regarding topics that they frankly aren't qualified to answer.  

TL;DR: I envision this as entirely optional and currently flared users could post whatever they would feel comfortable with on the sidebar whether it be a CV or something as simple as ""four-year degree

Edit: This need not only be what level of degree an individual has obtained as that's not always indicative of what they actually know - a lot of people are getting hung up on that.  When I say credentials I mean the things that make them qualified to answer a question about say the social impact of malaria whether it's extensive NGO work in Africa, or some other factor - each has their own unique and valid perspective.

&gt; The hereditary principle has almost vanished from politics. During my lifetime, Russia, Germany, and Austria have disappeared, to be replaced by dictators who do not aim at the foundation of a hereditary dynasty. ... Political dynasties have disappeared, but economic dynasties survive. ... When you consider how natural it seems to us that the power over the lives of others resulting from great wealth should be hereditary, you will understand better how men like Sir Robert Filmer could take the same view as regards the power of kings

It got me thinking about removing the hereditary principle from the economic sphere. That is to say

Please avoid intellectual laziness. This isn't a poll. State your reasons and how you came to such conclusions. If you haven't reached a conclusion please state any merits or demerits that you see if they haven't been stated already.

I've yet to form a conclusion but I have put some thought into the issue.

The first thought is that any system to limit economic heredity wouldn't be a perfect system. Much like the economic system we have today isn't perfect. I don't believe a lack of perfection is any grounds to reject a system

Second, not a reason to dismiss the idea. Two sets of capital controls would help, one set for countries who also limit economic heredity and one for those who don't.

My third thought is that

Fourth, which society will be stronger? The society which shares it's wealth with one another or the society which hoards it in tax havens?

My fifth thought is about how to decide how to allocate such great amounts of money. A budget committee which allocates last years contributions is probably the most fair method. The budget could also be voted on by elected officials. The money could be used to help fund university education or other areas which the private sector neglects

**My most important thought**

The dissemination of power has proven to be advantageous on most every occasion. Enabling women workers gave us Marie Curie. School girls in Afghanistan have acid thrown in their faces while we benefit from female intellectuals from all walks of life. Liberation from serfdom enabled the mobility of labour allowing cities to grow and become industrial hotspots. Imagine how China would have become the manufacturing powerhouse it is today if it's farmers were legally tied to their plot of land. Finally

* More domestic jobs created because companies don't have to outsource work

I used to think that people who tiped liek dis were younger people but I've seen older people, a nurse, once sent me a text that said 'hus fone is dis'. It wasn't a surprise that her daughter typed the same way as her and every now and then, whenever she'd text me, I'd have to reread her texts to figure out what she was saying or ask her to clarify because of the way she spelled things and the lack of punctuation.
On the other end of the spectrum

Are people more inclined to type correctly/incorrectly depending on what they're doing/who they're talking to? I think it's a no-brainer that even people who type hard-to-read sentences on Facebook/Youtube, they'll type 'freely'. Maybe it's due to laziness? Apathy? Or some people think it feels too formal? 

I have a friend who I text often and sometimes it takes me a second to figure out what she's saying. On Facebook

On various websites, or at least people generally try to do so. On Youtube and Facebook, you'll probably find a mix of both. Is this due to the target audience/demographics of the sites?

I think we should put value on cultural evolution rather than biological evolution.

He also thinks that people of ""good"" genetics should reproduce more than people of ""bad"" genetics -- not forced

Our argument was inspired by watching X-men 2. He told me he would be on Magneto's side, a pyro living as a pyrotechnical, whereas Professor Xavier thinks mutants should simply live side by side non-mutants. All this on the premise that mutants are the next step in human evolution. I respond that evolution is too chaotic to determine what the ""next step"" is.

1335394231.0,ssk8c,Does anyone regret getting an economics degree ?,,33,2,34,"Hi

Just wondering if any undegrad economist regret their choices. I guess I am being more specific towards those who are not going to be a professional economist or academic.

I'm sure you'll agree if you went to a decent university your economics degree must have had some kick ass difficult combination of maths and essay writings and some more. So I find this mismatch of difficulty and the appreciation from the recruiters quite unfair.

Job market wise
But other engineering/science/language degrees holders can still take up these analyst jobs in banks/insurance/accounting companies and at the same time able to go into their degree specific roles. So I feel I am being hard done by the fact that I didn't really learn a unique set of skills or knowledges.

I have worse things to say about those who did business or accounting as a degree. But I think they are the smart ones - they still land the same kind of jobs as economists while cruising through their degree.

I guess it really comes down to viewing your degree as a tool for the job market. Clearly business/accounting students do. But we economists shouldn't.

I have never, Ohio and most everywhere else around here (couple hundred mile radius), the gas prices are intensely erratic. Everywhere else I've ever lived, gas prices go up and down by 2-5 cents at a time and usually nothing more. But in the midwest, gas prices spike violently, as much as 30 cents over night and can go up 50-60 cents in a week. 

It makes no sense to me, within 2 hours everyone will adjust to match speedway. And the same on the way down. 

You ask where my evidence is? 

http://www.gasbuddy.com/gb_retail_price_chart.aspx?time=24

Go to town. 

Pick almost any two towns from around the country, Jackson, Miami, Salem...Now for your third choice, choose a midwest city. Try Dayton, Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Cleveland

Also try changing the scale. Put a city like El Paso and then put Dayton and change it from 2 years to 1 month. Look at the spikes in Dayton vs the very consistent price in El Paso. Change it to 3 months? 6 months? 9 months? 1 year? Always the same thing

So there is this little region in the midwest that has awful gas spikes. The average price over the years is pretty close to the national average

Also note worthy is that the price NEVER falls the way it raises and I mean NEVER. So today the price rose 26 cents. Typically it will not take 7-14 days for that price to fall back to where it was. So it rises instantly and falls gradually.

This kind of decision inevitably stirs up a very particular kind of comment from both reddit and the real world; that those accused of sexual assault should be anonymous until their guilt or innocence is decided (obviously the implication is that they would remain anonymous if it were found they were innocent unless they chose to reveal their name).

To me

Now I want to be clear that I am asking about *all crimes*, but I don't agree with this line of reasoning. What I do agree with is that *ceteris parabis* it is better innocent people do not even have the taint of an accusation of eg theft, murder, fraud about them because the rest of our judicial system seems built around the principle of protecting the innocent rather than punishing the guilty at all costs.

So why don't we offer the victim and accused anonymity in all cases (maybe just anonymity from the press since it would probably be impractical otherwise)? What would be the effects if we did? Would there be any effect on the reported or actual rate of crime?

Just found this subreddit after subscribing to /r/economics recently. Both seem great. Since /r/economics doesn't seem to like self posts I wanted to ask here:

Can someone summarize the European debt crisis? 

I'm not totally unaware, they weren't. We have votes questioning austerity, Spain crumbling, etc. But I just feel like I'm missing a crucial piece of narrative or explanation. 

Why is the debt crisis a crisis and not

Is the UK safe from many of these issues or is it's economic proximity going to draw it down too?

Thanks! I'm really interested to learn more.

In a Pure Democracy the whole population is votes on each law, set punishment for cimes, declare war, and even determine the procedure for making new laws.

Other parts of Communism that people talk about a lot for example the ""proletarian rising up against the Bourgeoisie"" and ""seizing control of the means of production"" appear to me to be irrelevant to how Communism would actually work because this would only happen once.

My understanding of the situation is that Amazon is a much larger company and with no brick and mortar presence.  This enables them to absorb the overhead to a greater degree and offer lower prices well continuing to remain profitable.  The large price difference seems out of place though.

Finally, just barely more than Amazon.  To my knowledge this is not a chain, and my understanding is that smaller businesses are less able to absorb the cost of overhead and therefore have to slightly markup items to remain profitable.

I would like to know what would happen in a world where the price of products is determined by the time it takes to produce them. For the sake of simplicity, ""time"" is not actually traded, but the currency would allow people to buy and sell things worth a certain amount of time. Thus, the currency would be valued by time, like a bill of 5 hours, or coins of 10 minutes.

The idea that struck me was that I thought this might be a good representation of their worth. Also, as their daily earnings would cancel with their cost of living. Then I thought about if there would be profit, or if there even could be.

If someone could enlighten me on this subject, please add in anything that is relevant that I might not have considered yet. Below are some questions that I have.

* What are the major strengths/weaknesses of such a system?

* By banning firearms magazines greater than 20 rounds

* When you start giving people free housing, then what is stopping you from giving them free education, healthcare, etc.?

It appears to me that one should acknowledge the potential long-term path certain policy decisions may end up taking.  Other concepts, are perfect examples of 'moving goalposts' in terms of policy reach and scope.

An example for this is: Today, further increasing the reach and scope of the organization.  Once this becomes commonplace, then the TSA will expand further and further.

As a freedom-loving human being, safety, and security.  Any increase in power and scope of Gov't authority needs to be weighed heavily and be difficult to accomplish.
