* Do not wipe more than 3 times.  If you need more cleaning get in the shower


* Never force a turd. Do not push! Seriously wait for the deuce to come knocking and let it fall out.

* This last one may be completely bullshit and in my mind but it has seemed to help big time in the last 5 years or so.  If you take a shit and feel a pain in your inner rectum or start to feel some pressure like you may get a grape on your ass try to use your ass muscles to push it back up into the colon.

It was early afternoon on a winter day in January. I was driving to upstate New York to visit a school I was looking into going to. I had left earlier that morning, I just figured that I ate too much food and was over full, so I unbuttoned my jeans and it seemed to ease the discomfort so I continued driving. About two hours into the trip I stopped and got gas, considered going to the bathroom but I just wanted to get to the school because it had started snowing lightly.

I pressed on

My stomach kept growling and turning, 10 Miles"" Only ten more miles until I could empty my bowels. That was the longest 10 mile drive ever. I was sweating, profusely, so bad I opened the windows to get some cold air in the car. As I got closer to the rest area the pain only got worse, I had to fart so bad but I knew I couldn't risk it.

After 10 miles of pain I finally parked the car and hobbled into the rest area, wishing that I wouldn't shit my pants in front of everyone at the rest area. I hobbled into the bathroom, went right for the handicapped stall and ripped my pants off and proceeded to let loose, the loudest, smelliest, most repulsive porcelain shattering dump I have ever taken in my life. It was the kind of shit, that when you finally let loose and it's all over you let out a little ""ohhh yeahh"" I got up from the toilet and it was like a murder scene, on the sides of the toilet, the worst

    When I was 20 I finally went to a gastroenterology specialist who diagnosed me with IBS. No relief infact the medication made me sick. Fast forward 9 years and my husband and I have a lightbulb moment...we start paying attention to what I eat and how it makes me feel. Turns out 29 years of hell and I'm lactose intolerant...it has been a month since I gave up dairy and I have never felt better. I poop everyday if not more than once a day. I am off four prescription meds and have not had a stomach ache. I feel amazing!

quick info:
-i have always had a really fast metabolism and it is not uncommon for me to take multiple poops every day(anywhere from 1-4+)

-i started eating a lot more a few years ago to bulk up while hitting the gym and this is where my problems started

-for a long time now i expect some sort of blood when i poop. it isn't dyeing the toilet water or anything. sometimes it will be on my stool but normally it is just from wiping

-my anus usually hurts after i'm done. never put anything inside of it so i know any damage i have has to be from pooping

-i get really annoying and intense itching sensations on(or in?) my anus. like right now. it sucks and i have no idea what to do about it. sometimes i will go sit down on the toilet just so i can rub it with some toilet paper

if anybody has dealt with this before i have a shitty request for you. i am going to link to a picture of my bunghole

My first important memory was in the 4th grade when I was too terrified to poop because I thought it would be too big. I held it in for over 2 weeks. The Girl Scouts leader told my mom I was super white, eat pepperoncini, etc. It finally happened, with me screaming at the top of my lungs, and it was a fucking tiny ball. (I wonder if its genetic because my cousin had to go to the doctors to get it all cut up and stuff when he was a younging. He has issues too.)

Aside from the usual toilet clogging

On vacations, or a portapotty that happened to be around. Yes, I've done all this in the name of not clogging a family/friends/hotel toilet.

I recently clogged my friend's friend's toilet. It was a colossal shit, though my friend knew it was me (he drives me to a 24-7 grocery store to poop when the urge strikes so I don't clog his toilet lol). I wonder if  they ended up having to get a professional plumber...

So I poop at work. I try not to poop at home but if I have to do it, my office switched floors, and I wouldn't be surprised if the janitor put two and two together and narrowed down who is continuously leaving these unflushable shits.

My current issue? I am dieting, now is 1x a week, if that. I drink detox tea, take probiotics, colon cleanse pill, etc. Why is it worse now that I'm trying to get healthy? I pooped more regularly and they flushed more often when I was eating tons of terrible food and sitting around the house all day never drinking water! I had gotten the detox tea to work for a week, and I dropped 6 pounds just pooping!

WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO TO POOP NORMAL SIZED SHITS ON A MUCH MORE NORMAL BASIS?

I asked my doctor, anal wasn't a problem with me.) Can I die from not being able to poop? I am convinced one day I'm going to die on the toilet trying to poop.

I've taken to eating a large salad as a complete meal (lunch or dinner) a few times a week -- typical contents are lettuce, other salad vegetables, and a vinaigrette.

I'm finding that I almost always get painful diarrhea about an hour or two after the meal is done, pale yellow or pale green and ... sometimes a little frothy? (think beer head, not a thick and undifferentiated layer, but here and there).

Does this sound like something I might want to seek treatment for? I've seen in a few places that salad alone can bring diarrhea for those with regular GIs, so I'm concerned about IBS or something like it.  Thanks in advance

I would say my bowels are fairly normal since I poop every other day, the stool comes out around 7-9 inches in length but it is very wide, and thick looking. This is problematic because most of the time, it is too wide for the toilet hole and just ends up going through half way and remains stuck. It is extremely embarressing using toilets at my university apartment, at home, and at friend's houses because I always clog the toilet and it overflows, causing my broken pieces of stool to spill out and flood the entire bathroom.

I find the main problem is a shitting schedule. If I go at the same time every day, I won't be constipated. I never have to strain, it's a matter of the urge simply disappearing. If I postpone a dump for any reason, I become constipated for the next few days. But when I do manage to go...

2) it takes me upwards of 30 minutes to wipe. I don't get it. I don't put much pressure, my ass gets sore and its pretty common to cause bleeding through abrasion (from repetition, not pressure).

- Extremely fiber rich diet (beans, etc ONLY)
- Activia
- ""Probiotic"" drinks

- Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
- Hiatal Hernia
- GERD
- Gastritis 
- Minor hypoglycemia
- Hashimoto's Disease (thyroid autoimmune disorder - levels are extremely low
- Overactive bladder problems

I have been taking Miralax every day for 4 years now. Although it helps, and constipated even with laxative. I cannot for ONE DAY be off the Miralax or I am incapable of shitting. Something else I have noticed, is that when I do eat too much like that, my urine will become cloudy. 

I have been a vegetarian for a few years now, mainly home cooking. And when I say vegetarian: No meat or fish, &amp;amp; eggs only if they are baked/cooked within something. Although I will still consume dairy, it is not much.

------------

I've been meaning to ask this for the longest time.  (preemptive **tl;dr**: When I shit I instantly don't feel depressed/anxious)

I've had lifelong problems with constipation and chronic back pain, I feel these feelings bubble up inside of me; even sometimes (though rare) I literally become ecstatic - I'll begin laughing non-stop for a few minutes or can't control my smiles, I instantly become extremely optimistic, focused, etc., it's very weird.

Is it possible that some of my depressed state could be attributed to ... of all things

As an example: often when I'm sitting doing my homework I'm so anxious that I can't get myself to start it or continue on.  I notice my anxiety actually becomes extremely bad at some points, and come back with much less anxiety (suddenly, homework isn't scary to me anymore, and I dive in more freely).  I'm not sure if the *act* of shitting is making it *better*, or if the fact that I needed to go so badly was *causing* it and simply by going it put me at a normal level of anxiety (which thing is the causer, which is the resultant).

The same goes with my back pain - when that's gone, I'm not sure which is the causer and which is the resultant: is my chronic back problems causing the constipation, or is my constipation causing my back pain?  And which, then, are actually alleviating my depression - getting rid of the shit, or the lessened back pain?

Given the subject matter (and how fucking stupid that sounds)

I found it was useful to take the pics, how many (I think I have some more pics of additional fissures further inside my ass chute, but cant find them - your loss).

So, to keep it 'moisturized'. That didn't work.  Next, I tried Baby powder, to try to dry it out. That didn't work either, but it felt good.  Tried both of these for upwards of a week each.

My next idea was ""New Skin Liquid Bandage"", so I tried it out. STINGS LIKE HELL!

So, except it seems to use a different solvent which doesn't sting, and it takes a bit longer to dry.  I started doing this about two weeks ago, and today the fissure is almost complete healed. I'm going to continue it for another week or so.  I can hear the cries for more pics already!

I should add that I am fortunate enough to have a caring partner who is willing to be coaxed to applying the treatment. Pretty important really

I've been a vegetarian for the past 4 years and have recently only developed this illness.  I was diagnosed with IBS from a GI 5 months ago.  I was told to try various diets/supplements including lactose-intollerence, and now I'm trying a low FODMAP diet.  Unfortunately none of these really helped (still waiting on seeing how the fodmap goes).

My symptoms aren't necessarily diherea (Though sometimes it happens).  It's more that my stools aren't solid at all (but not wet), then twice during school (despite not eating during the day), then coming home going to the bathroom, usually going twice more during the night.

Obviously with it being IBS, I can't do that).  I'm often figitty and consequently sweat more when I have to go.  I really need some advice (whether that be medical or psychological) to get me through this next month without completely embarrassing myself.

This July I was hospitalized for 3 days with a campylobacter infection.  I shat green/bloody water for like a week straight. My bowels have not returned to normal. I've always been a bit poopy-- prone to beer shits, I've had diarrhea 4/7 days of the average week. I made an appointment with my doctor after I saw a streak of blood on the toilet paper in September. It got better for a little bit in October and I had 3 whole weeks of mostly-solid stool with only 1 or 2 liquid episodes. But now it's returned with a vengeance.  It's been a week since I've seen an even vaguely normal looking turd. All my poop is completely liquid, bright orangey-yellow, greasy, and foul smelling. In addition, I'm bloated, flatulent, and have dull

My standard blood tests came back normal-- no anemia, with no indication of parasites, viruses, bacteria, or even blood. I had a liver function panel as well this past week-- normal. I'm negative for Hep A, B, and C. The only weird thing in all my testing was from my ultrasound: my liver has a slight coarseness that was so mild the radiologist considered not even telling me about it. My pancreas, appendix, stones

I'm a 24 year old, and moderate alcohol consumption (&lt; 5 standard drinks/week). I have been rather inactive in the past few months, but that's been more the result of illness than anything else. I also have been diagnosed with GAD and major depression, but nothing more serious than that. 

What is going on with me? Doesn't most inflammatory bowel disease have an impact on liver function and blood test results? Wouldn't gallstones/pancreatitis have shown up on the ultrasound?

The second time I went I told her it didn't work so she told me buy a mineral oil laxative and that I should take it a couple times every day, and 1 inch in height but only came out about twice a week

The pills worked in the same vein as the mineral oil did, I was able to poop, only small amounts and it was about twice a week as well.

Before and after these events are tried a lot of other things that didn't end up work

After that I stopped going to the doctor, but they were still small stools and it still continues to this day except now it's about 1 to 2 times a week.

My diet isn't the best but it's starting to get better. I don't really eat much fibre except for four or five Weetbix in the mornings (if I eat breakfast that day). I poop maybe once a day unless I have diarrhea when I end up running to the toilet about three or four times a day. I had diarrhea at least once a week, however, I wouldn't poop at all for a day or two. 

I started noticing blood on the paper a few months ago. It was bright red and normally went away after one wipe. It wouldn't be there every time I pooped - but most times.

I've had a bacterial throat infection and my cough suppressant causes constipation so over the past week I barely pooped. 
Over the past few hours I had stomach cramps and then when I pooped tonight there was a fair amount of blood on the paper. I thought I had my period at first - then I thought I somehow had a cut on my butt. It took about four wipes for it to go away and when I was pooping it hurt a little- like my butt was ripping slightly but the poop wasn't that big.

A brief explanation why I ask this question. I love to shit the hard end of the spectrum

The soft end of the spectrum (5-7) needs much more wiping but it is still bearable. 

However, my colon does not get empty. I simply cannot push all the stuff out. A big chunk is left at the end of the colon, often hanging out of the anus, and I have to wipe forever without a chance of reaching the *clean anus state*. Meanwhile I make pushing attempts again in the hope of eventually emptying my colon, which I cannot accomplish for some reason, hence I have to start the endless wiping over. 

In the past year I had all different types, which I consider to be a good tendency: the less wiping, the better.  Also, the frequency is descending: sometimes it occurs that I have no shit in 2 or 3 days. Only problem is, type4 is still reappearing again and again: roughly every third shit is of type4.

What could possibly be the cause of having **type4** shit? I noticed for example that there is a strong correlation between going out

Do you think such diet and/or life-hack exists that guarantees you always shit type2 or type3?

Optional: any tricks that help when dealing with type4?

I had the worst case of diarrhea I have ever experienced. It was just a brown puddle in my toilet and it smelled pretty bad. After wiping, I stood up and felt another rush about to come so I sat down. Obviously I was sweating quite a bit, so I drank water afterwards for fear of dehydration.

I went back to sleep, but there was more water than actual poop. Like, instead of an all brown puddle, I could point out where's my piss and poo. I think I actually shitted water.

This happened all Wednesday morning until around 5am where I felt a gag coming up. nothing serious but I forced out a cough

Wednesday morning my mom gave me some anti-diarrhea medicine

That worked until I started having my periods at 11 and would hold poop in until the heavy flow stopped, and this habit disrupted my semi-regularity. I haven't been regular since then, except for two months last spring when I would poop the same time almost every day, but I could only accomplish that by reading shampoo bottle labels while I did it.

My diet was a little healthier at that time I guess, and various meals cooked from boxes, no cereal and hardly ever any fruit.

I apologize for any grammatical or spelling errors. This was typed in a flurry so please forgive me.

I've done plenty of googling but everything is ridiculously vague.

Starting about a month ago, (at what point is it even diarrhea?!) but soft with multiple pieces rather than one big one. I've also been accompanied with not necessarily rot gut, but a general unsteadiness and unease; I don't feel awful, but I don't feel good either.

They are accompanied with quite a bit of yellow-white mucus mixed in and sometimes a white fuzzy exterior if they're in pebble form. They're either loose/soft pieces or hard little pebbles.

These stools happen around 2 - 3 times a day and cause mild to moderate discomfort before and after passing.

I've also started getting weird side aches in both the front upper left side of my abdomen (just under my rib) and around the front right side (usually lower abdomen). Feels kind of like a side stitch that you get from running when you're out of shape. These aches are right after eating most of the time though I seldom encountered this pain sensation till about 4-5 weeks ago.

I guess that the body switches over from the parasympathetic nervous system to the sympathetic nervous system, and dumps (ha!) whatever it doesn't need—in this case, I can work to conceal, and very uncomfortable.

So far, there's an event coming up in a few days where I anticipate not being able to access a restroom for about 8-10 hours.

I was in and out of the doc's office for a year, neuro and no one had an answer.  I've had several MRI's, anoscope, treated for hemorrhoids. Treated for nerve issues, had gluten tests, blood tests and more.

My problem is that I feel like I have a lump in my butt, it can hurt during BM, rarely any blood.  Typical hemorrhoid stuff, right?  I was told I had some internal roids but nothing that seemed like it should be causing some of my other symptoms.

It was not a fart

I had sharted myself

This persisted til October when I went to my doctor for it, told me to take more supplements, and he sent me on my way.

I took them every once in a while until about March, I thought it was natural, I was often going to the toilet, pushing, and having nothing coming out, but wiping anyway, so I assumed it a rash possibly.

Then two days later, so (naturally) I made a doctor's appointment. He told me that I had probably tore my anus (never before did I think I would use ""butt hurt"" in a sentence without a trace of humour) and suggested I stay on the pills and take ""Restorolax"". I've taken it every other day since then (big fuckin' packages, says it lasts from 1-3 days) as well as my regular supplements, and this was 2 weeks ago. On friday I had pain again, and saturday as well, not as severe, but troubling to say the least.

**First some backstory:**
I am caucasian, then have to rush to the toilet and where I'd get hot flashes, cold sweats, and I'd just feel *horrible*.

The constipation was far less common

I talked a few times to my Dr about it, and was also told to get some OTC *Miralax* and some generic stool softener. I used them occasionally but of course, they only treated symtoms and nothing ever got better.

**Fast forward to today:**
I've been on a variety of medications for awhile which I believe have altered my BM's. I take daily:

* 200mg Seroquel XR
* 300mg Effexor
* 100mg Topamax
* a Multivitamin

Since taking these medications I rarely if ever get diarrhea anymore and am now stuck on a constant constipation cycle. I have a BM about once a week, on the [Bristol Stool Scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Stool_Scale). It has become increasingly painful. I generally stuff a cloth or part of my shirt in my mouth to muffle my groans and screams. For the past few months I have been seeing blood, more and more it seems. Now when I wipe, the tissue is *soaked* with blood - no stool. The last few times there were clots. Similar to [this photo](http://i.imgur.com/fm9aJ.jpg).^(not mine, found online)

I am torn about going to the doctor since my parents' insurance has changed and just a simple checkup might cost me hundreds of dollars now (I live in the US). I was laid off a few months ago and have been really struggling just to pay bills

Firstly, I have a lot of social anxiety, as well as body issues... and frankly the thought of something like a colonoscopy is mortifying. I don't want to do it if I don't have to...

I know this isn't a substitute for medical advice

Thanks

So you know I am on the level I have sharted / practically shit myself a few times (Twice while wearing white pants. No bullshit) If you have a small shart you can typically handle this with just a bit of toilet paper and a bit of uncomfortable mud butt.  The one time I did actually shit myself I was lucky which brings me to my first point.

Find water immediately. When I had a full blown assplosion I was camping and near a body of water


If you have access to a bathroom obviously get there asap

Do not try to flush the evidence it will probably end up clogging the toilet and not only bringing attention to yourself (As you will either be free balling at this point or wearing one sock)  But if there is a detective around they will figure it out.  The other option here is to hide the evidence in the upper deck of the toilet

Depending on the circumstances you can toss shitty drawers and or socks out the window but I would not recommend it.


Lastly you are probably going to smell either way, shampoo fucking anything just rub it in anywhere you think may have been infected by poo.

Worst case scenario:  You have none of the above options

So for as long as I can remember(I'm 19) I've had issues taking a poop. I went to the doctor once or twice past year and she simply diagnosed it IBS.. since my grandma also has IBS and she said the symptons were clearly IBS.

About 3 years ago I had these very long and painful shits were my belly would cramp and squeeze together and I had very irregular shits.. I didn't go anywhere because I was afraid to shit my pants..why? because it had already happened when I was little and I never want to experience that ever again.

Since past year my symptoms changed.. I was eating [this](http://www.kws-shop.nl/files/2992/products/1035627/waldkorn_brood_1.jpg) type of bread because everyone said: EAT MORE FIBER. Well shit went down fast

So I started following this diet. It was a diet where nearly nothing was allowed, no cheese, no lactose in general, no nothing nearly. It was a diet of 2-3 full months. I completed it and in that time my shits were pretty good actually, it changed to shitting 1-2 times a day.

When the diet was done I started eating cheese again once in a while. Then I had the great idea to start eating pancakes, this is a sign that your belly can't digest a type of food or something, I still have that sometimes to this day(Lactose?) ) 

My shits nowadays are kind of strange, and it felt like it was good but when I checked the toilet what I had dropped there were these floating thin [skins](http://0.tqn.com/d/localfoods/1/0/O/2/-/-/Peach5.jpg) (I really don't know how to describe it.) You can compare them when you skinned a peach. That skin from a peach was floating in there in pieces. They looked brownish and just looked like undigested food skins. Also, my shit was falling apart, it looked like it was soft.. good shape when it came out of my anus but once in the water it went to a snake to a heap of brown liquid plaster.

I've come to the conclusion that it seems like my bowel can't digest anything.. spices are a bad idea

Morning: 2 x [French pistolets](http://bakerystars.nl/afbeeldingen/producten/BO_Pistolet_wit.jpg) with some cooked ham or easy to digest [sausage](http://www.tomassen.eu/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/p/a/palingworst.jpg)

Lunch: same as above,.[nuts](http://www.olijfje.eu/Medias/Webshop1/638560_a.jpg)

Diner: My parents know of my situation so they cook very light, no lactose (milk) added to the food etc. So mostly lets take a example from what I've eaten yesterday for diner.

- [string beans](https://eigentuin.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/20120802_snijbonen_02.jpg)
- [small baked potatoes in the pan](http://www.publicare.nl/kokkie_henkie_nieuwe_kooksite_2012/hollands/vis_kip_witlof_gerecht/gebakken_krieltjes.jpg)

and 2x [this as cooked in the pan](http://us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/szakaly/szakaly1206/szakaly120600073/14001441-gebakken-hamburger-vlees-in-een-hete-koperen-pan.jpg)

Now mind you that this is all made with cooking butter without lactose or anything like that.


And the result was

Now, and it always works on my bowel movement, seems like when Im completely chilled out I get better shits.)

The thing I worry the most about is


I hope this is some sufficient information and that someone can help me out.. because I want to live a life where I don't  have to think about taking a shit every hour.. or being too afraid to go out with friends because I think my belly will fuck it up.

Thanks in advance.. if you need to know anything else.. please ask me.

TLDR: I have soft / loose / undigested shits and poop about 2-3 times a day. I want to shit more solid shits where my food has been digested well and maybe lessen the times I have to poop a day.

Is there a chance all 3 foodstuff are related? I've never had this problem in the past and it's really bad because almost every meal I have tends to have a little of such pepper. I've not consulted a doctor but i don't know what good it will do. 

I've been having this for so long it's really getting to me now. The swelling discomforts me to the point of feeling depressed. Are the foodstuff related somehow or is this the sign of something worse going on with me? I don't have much income so I'm trying to avoid seeing the doctor until I'm sure there's something wrong to go. 

Any help would be much appreciated.

That is a small concern. I would like to go more regularly, but I did not like the water retention. I always felt and looked bloated. So I stopped taking them.

My other concern is the consistency of my stool. Basically every time I go, here's what happens....I feel a movement coming and I go to the bathroom. One normal turd comes out, usually of good consistency and with a clean wipe. I then leave the bathroom and then 5-10 minutes later, I'm back on the toilet with fairly runny and/or pencil-like stool that is fairly painful/crampy to pass. I find myself rocking back and forth on the toilet (because that helps to pass the stool) and bent over with my elbows on my knees to get in good position. But this second time on the toilet is always runny/pencil-like and generally not that comfortable to pass. It's kind of like there is a normal ""plug"" of poop and once that is out of the way, out comes the works after 5 minutes (which is runny, etc...).

I have been like this for some time and like I said, but eat lots of vegetarian meals as well. I drink at least 3-4 big glasses of water per day, usually more. I exercise regularly. I'm 5'9"" (1.75M) and weigh 177 lbs (80kg), so not really over weight to a significant degree. 

I'm really at a loss here. This has been my pooping situation for quite some time and I would really like to go a bit more regularly and have a more solid consistency to my movements. I'm not too nervous that it is a health issue because this is my normal shitting situation but I'd like it to be better (if possible). I've never noticed blood or anything else in my stool

So for about 4 or 5 months now, I burp SO much.  I don't know where it's coming from - they're really *really* deep, growly burps.  I feel them start in my stomach and work their way up, but the thing is they don't really escape my mouth, if that makes sense.  They just kind of force themselves up, and I'm less bloated.  But these burps don't come from anywhere! I get them from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep, and even more so immediately after eating anything.  I've been told to keep track - but it's literally after eating anything that they get worse.  It seems like burping has taken the place of farting

The only things I can think of that have changed since September is I eliminated pop from my diet completely, but my lack of bowel movements and excess burping is starting to worry me.  I've gained a good amount of weight, but I'm not sure if that's directly caused by not pooping regularly.  I'm not even sure if the burping thing is related.

I guess I will summarize what's been happening:

Sometime in september, so I tried to make sure to get more fiber. Anyway, I think it was abnormally long before I had to go again, and I was kind of afraid to. I'm not sure if it was then or a few times after, but I wasn't able to go. It felt a bit different from what I normally thought of as constipation, which would be more like the first time I described, where it's too hard. Anyway, but nothing would come out (usually; sometimes later a small amount would come out and it would be a normal consistency

After that, except it was in smaller pieces (lengthwise), which is generally true to today. Then, about 2-2.5 weeks later, I got constipated in the same way again. This kept happening pretty regularly (it would go away on its own in about 2 or 3 days and come back around 2 weeks later). In November, I went to the doctor, and he said to get fiber, and exercise. So I paid more attention to getting more fiber and water. Exercise was a bit harder

I either went back to the doctor or emailed him, I started taking miralax every day around January, I believe. I took it every day for about 2 weeks, I think. I started recording when I could go to the bathroom, when I was constipated, if anything was out of the ordinary, and when I took miralax around this time in case it was useful for a doctor, so I could always verify.

Anyway, and wondered if constantly taking a laxative was any better than constipation. 

In February, except it went away while I was still sitting on the toilet, which had never happened before, and I eventually was able to go pretty normally. This happened again in February, and then there was this weird period where everything just moved really slowly, apparently (I don't really remember, to be honest, there was no constipation like before in February and some of March. Then I did get constipated like before and I waited to see if it would go away and it didn't. However

I got constipated like before (2-3 days) one more time in March. Throughout April, I was constipated for about 9 days, which hadn't happened any of the previous times, but was otherwise the same, I think. I had a bit of trouble getting an appointment, but I did end up going to the bathroom a couple days after that post. Since then, I haven't gotten constipated at all. Though a few times it has been too soft (haven't been taking any laxatives since January).

Also, water, exercise, maybe a laxative, otherwise it gets too hard, but it's definitely not too hard), and said that a GI doctor is just going to tell me the same thing.

So, considering I haven't been constipated in about 1.5 months? Should I insist on a referral? Should I be worried about occasional excessive softness/that instance of diarrhea?",,False,,t5_2rg3c,1340764433.0,,

This triggered my OCD to realise that something was up and I wasn't as clean as normal people. This led to a sharp increase in how long it took me to clean up

Fast-forward to today. I seem to fluctuate wildly between days where my BMs are mostly fine (which takes around 1hour...) to days where they are awful (somewhere between 2.5 and 6 hours). Doctors are mostly dismissing the problem as it's ""not dangerous"". Aside from the fact that it's ruining my life completely.

I'll use last night as an example of a bad day:

Felt awful all day at work, my asshole wasn't TOO bad. Thought I'd got away with it. Turns out I was entirely wrong.

When I checked the sides of my asscheeks, to the extent that they're sore most of the time from pulling them around whilst wiping, and there's some lumps/uneven skin as a result.

I've tried cutting out gluten - which seemed to help for a while (this was when I had a week or two of being absolutely fine, didn't seem to help).

I don't eat much in the way of fruit/veg, but it never seems to make much difference. I don't eat much greasy food (I've cut out crisps[chips if you're US], I rarely have anything that's fried, I genuinely eat healthier food - just lack Veg).

I take Omeprazole every day as I have heartburn/indigestion problems if I don't

I am going to give to all you desperate masses the one most shameful secret in my life in hopes that your curiosity will be satisfied.  And hopefully, so great will be your disgust at what I have to offer.

Here it is.

Around 18 months ago, also).  We started out great, each of us strapping on our iPods, clipping on our headphones and making our way down the street.  The first day, I decided that jogging was in order.  I made it about 2 blocks before my body decided that it had enough.  My folly was grand and I made it home only to find that upon entering the house my muscular system shut down completely.  However, we trudged on in the following days.  My companion and I walked briskly covering three quarters of a mile at first and as the weeks wore on, we move to one mile and then to a mile and a half each night.  With each passing evening, endorphin filled exercise.  My boy and I loaded our iPods with fast

And, so awful, so shameful that it ceased our means to happiness and shut down our walking cycle forever. As fall settled in, the days became shorter and the light scarce.  We tried to make our walk before dinner in order to make frugal use of the sun's last rays.  It was difficult and we often times found ourselves making the last leg of our walk in the dusk's final throes.  Then one night, it happened, dinner was ready too early and we had to wait and eat before we ventured out.  Roxy pleaded with me to skip the walk just this one night.  I couldn't.  I didn't dare.  So addicted was I to this practice that I waved off her desires and set my own to appease the beast inside me that needed so desperately to exercise.

Ben and I readied ourselves for our adventure. As I pulled on my shoes and plucked my iPod from its cradle, it's just the digestions of a premature dinner.  And off Ben and I went to do our business.  Dusk gave way to the night as we rounded our first street corner.  Again, I felt my stomach begin to gurgle, its ornery bellowing rising though my body like an angry volcano.  Again, I paid no mind in order to finish the task at hand.  We moved on until we had made half of our sojourn.  By this time I could feel the revolt deep within my bowels.  My insides were churning like a taffy pulling machine and I knew that I was in trouble.  A quick internal diagnostic began within me and my mind and body reached a natural covenant - as long as I kept moving, I would make it home.

Ben and I rounded onto the next street and moved toward the half way point.  Then, he said in a panicked voice; real bad.  Not wanting to break my body's internal contract I pleaded with him to hold on until we got home.  He agreed that he would try and we continued on.  As we made the turn onto the sidewalk, Ben again motioned me to listen to him.  The panic in his eyes was real and he begged me to let him pee somewhere.  Looking around, I spotted a dark, unlit area of tall wooden fence that would provide temporary cover for him.  I relented and motioned him to do his business over there.

I stopped; I broke my contract.

A rock dropped from my stomach into my lower intestines.  The gurgling grew louder and I felt the pain shoot up my backside.  I had stopped and broken the covenant my brain made with my butt.  I was in trouble and I had nowhere to go.  Ben came back from doing his business, my head turning back and forth until I spotted safety.  Across the street, in a newly developed neighborhood was a row of trees about 50 feet in from the road.  I looked at Ben and said we are going over there - now.  I began to move to cross the road and the pain shot through my right leg.  The pressure was great and I knew that if I moved, I was done for.  I stopped, standing at attention, my legs squeezed together, doing their best to hold off the imminent invasion.  My whole body was clenched into one tight, unable to move.

And then, I said to Ben.  And we trudged over.  I made it about 20 feet from the road and it hit me again, the pain and pressure surging through my body, my bowels gurgling in violent revolt.  I clenched again and waited for the pressure to subside.  Longer this time, but it did.  Wait here, I told my son as I made my way to the line of trees.  Finding the darkest part of night's shade, I loosened my belt

I pooped in the trees in a neighborhood

YOU DO NOT NEED TO READ THE BACK STORY IF YOU DON'T EANT TO



   Ever since I was in first grade, but I would ALWAYS have the urge to have a bowel movement at a certain time of the day, EVERY DAMN DAY. This isn't like 'oh hello there mr turd! I can hold you in until lunch you just wait' this is like someone is taking your guts and squeezing and twisting the poop out of them. The poop is just THERE and I need a toilet at that very moment, I have taken to shitting myself many times. That is just first grade..


Second grade rolls around and I call my special bowel movements ""the cramps"", it was rather embarrassing to be asked to be excused my class, and then spend 30 minutes to almost an hour in the bathroom, literally shitting your guts out. Eventually, as time wore on, they became a part of my daily routine and my excuse for being in the bathroom so damn long was, ""sorry I'm not feeling good

 In the middle of moving to a new house, sis, and bro. I'm in the bed, suddenly I jolt awake. There is a HOWLING pain in my abdomen, I recognize it as some type of hellified version of what I call ""the cramps"". I went into the bathroom as fast ad I could off the bed, I sat on the toilet for what felt like *hours* just shitting out thick diarrhea. This isn't like the watery hershy squirt shits, imagine a thick blizzard from Dairy Queen coming out your ass at a 100 fucking miles per hour, the first of many battles was won that night. I crawled back into the bed

Nearing the middle of second grade, anything to make the pain stop. I farted, they busted out laughing, and while I would have (under normal circumstances) laughed with them, breaking free of my sobs into hiccuping laughs, I didn't. I cried harder, it was one of those sulfur farts and it spread an inferno on my beyond -chafed ass. We never went to the doctor, the school, but if your me, and needless to say

  I had mild ""cramps"" every once in a while for a couple of years, and not any of the teachers gave a single damn. These were my hardening years, I saw that the world was a cruel place and I manned up. 4th grade was relatively good, most of my ""cramps"" happened at home, and for the most part they felt like what I would consider an actually normal dump for the few sweet times that it had lasted.  5th grade was chill , a couple of the bullying factors in, but not as nearly as relentless. I had a couple of good dumps at the school in which case the teacher was the most understanding, of course classmates questioned why I was gone for so long. Many had already made the assumption so I told them how it was  how it was. It was some glorified version of ""every time I take a shit


 6th grade was good for the first year at middle school, and most of the time spent was making sure it was over. Sometimes it comes a little slower as the other little shits travel through my gut, and I get the same goddamn cramp feeling every time it hits a spot and I swear to god, I can literally FEEL the shit moving through my intestines. Take a marker and draw a line down your arm, that's the only way I can help you imagine what this feels like. Lunch is a rather long period, and no one usually misses me and there are plenty of middle school excuses , ""had to stay back. In the class for a bit"" and things similar. One morning, releasing that morning piss as a familiar sensation takes over. I become nauseated, and with realization I between the small breaks that are rewarded to me, and I had to ball my fists up and his the counter

This is happening again, as I'm typing this. I'm spewing lava out of my ass at full force every couple of seconds due to my gut being so damn twisty. It hurts so damn much. I'm a girl, and having a period pales In comparison to this, even laughable! I don't know what's wrong with me, as started before , some type of trauma, mental or physical, but all guys do that, and did they get it diagnosed? If so, and if this information helps

Age: 13
Gender: female
Weight: 142.0 pounds(lb) 
Height: 5'1 (*roughly* I could be taller.) 
Any more information you need and I'll be happy to give it to you.

My apologies for the giant fucking wall of text, I could be wrong, but the chafing is starting again. Here we go again. DAMNIT I spoke too soon.
Tell me if this might need an NSFW tag. Please

Also, or maybe even if some other poor soul has it. I don't want to go to the doctor, because it really hasn't come down to that yet.

As a child, and I got a hemorrhoid that I still have. The hemorrhoid isn't painful and it doesn't bleed, but it's definitely one. It's more uncomfortable than anything else. Right now, I still have trouble pooping. This is my fourth day of constipation, which is okay for me. Sometimes I can go two weeks without pooping.

I take olive oil and probiotics in the morning with Optifiber. I come home and eat a big bowl of soupy vegetables, and dinner is usually a smaller cup of vegetables. Despite all that, I'm constipated. My parents aren't very helpful. My dad tells me to ""push harder"" and ""eat more vegetables"" and ""exercise more"" (I walk 1.5 miles on the weekdays and go to the gym on the elliptical for 40 - 60 minutes on Sundays). My mom wants to put me on a liquid diet or administer an enema (I think she uses one everyday or something). I took Miralax a few days ago, but no difference.

Right now, hourly trips to the bathroom result in nothing. If I suck in my stomach and poke my left side in the hollow of the hip, I can feel my poop, and it's really gross. (It just feels like a knot under the skin.)

&gt;Can you get physically ill from being out in the cold?

&gt;Last night I spent a good six hours sitting in my car in the cold. It was cold enough to start snowing. By the last hour I was shivering uncontrollably. I finally got home, tossing &amp; turning &amp; having strange dreams. My body felt a little like it does when you have the flu. I couldnt stop moving my arms &amp; legs.

&gt;Since i am a forever aloner (and a bit of a recluse) ... I rarely get sick since I dont have much contact with people. I DID have one small order of culvers wisconsin cheese curds last night (about 12 hours ago) and that was it. When i got home I just didnt feel like eating anything at all even though I knew I should be hungry. So I ate a half a cookie just to settle my stomach. ABout 5 hours later I awoke just feeling slightly off. Again

Note: also... last night I was extremely stressed out (social anxiety) and suffering a bit of an episode while first trying to go to sleep after I got home.

**TL/DR: about 4 hours ago I had a normal meal and now I have the full &amp; nauseous feeling again. Think I may end up vomiting again like the day before. As of late I dont seem to get hunger pains and instead feel just very slightly nauseous which makes me not want to eat. I have also been having infrequent large bowel movements and regular sized ones that are quite hard to pass. I am also quite dehydrated which I think is the main problem of passing BMs. Gonna try an enema in the morning if things dont get better. Gonna also have to pick up some serious fiber supplement... I dread taking that thru the checkout.**
