Getting better at this game is partly a choice. It's a choice of how much time you budget into practicing

Yes

However, anyday.

Did you just ladder and lose to some sort of all-in that makes you go ""omg protoss so imba!!!"" and want to know how to beat it? Do you just want to talk out some strategy you've been thinking of with someone without the time-lag that a subreddit or forum has?

That's what our TeamSpeak server provides.

In an instant, casters can be wrong).

The possibilities of improvement and fun are endless. 

Peepmodes, coaching, discussion, customs, Counter Strike, Left 4 Dead, stream viewing.

I encourage all of you, and promotions to acquire.

Without further ado

**tl;dr**: Getting better is having people to talk to instantaneously

1326088852.0,o8z1z,"Enough of the ""Macro Better""",packrat386,119,50,92,"Moved this to the top because I don't want people to misunderstand this.

Please note that I think macro is a hugely important factor at all levels


Now

Answers to posts on the strategy forum are getting ridiculously one dimensional. If the poster mentions that they are anything below platinum the top comment will almost certainly be something along the lines of ""You don't need to worry about this

I think this approach is flawed for a few reasons

1) People play at this level for fun - Bronze or silver level players may only play a couple of times a week but they do try to enjoy themselves. When most people play they want to improve all the aspects of their play. They will probably want to work on their macro as part of the plan

2) Sometimes it isn't the problem - There are plenty of cases where a player can far out macro their opponent and still lose even at low levels of play. A zerg player who masses a ton of zerglings will still lose to a terran player with tanks even if he is making zerglings off of 4 or 5 bases at once. Macro that is better than your opponent  != auto win. To any top player who says things like ""I made it out of platinum with just macro"" I can assure you that your choice of what unit to make a bunch of was informed by a superior knowledge of unit combinations and positioning

3) Its anti educational - Telling lower level players to disregard all other aspects of the game can only make it harder for them to learn these things later. Even if the ""macro better"" approach would get them out of gold league

4) Everyone already knows - I can pretty much guarantee that there are no bronze league players that think that their macro is impeccable and that the only thing keeping them out of GM is unit combos

EDIT - Spelling + Grammar

EDIT 2 - I don't want to have to make this reply to all of the many comments it replies to so here it is. If someone asks an open ended question like ""How do I get better"" then telling them to improve their macro is a valid (and possibly the best) suggestion. This was intended to for the context of specific questions such as ""How do I beat mass colossi as zerg"" where the poster is looking for advice that only applies to a specific game or games where he or she lost to that unit combination.

1310478725.0,inegb,Useful zerg timings and tips (high masters zerg),kubrickfilm,65,2,38,"Watching streamers and pros consistently for the past year has helped me develop little timings and tips that may be useful to any zerg players. These tips are not by any means pro tips (in fact

-Don't build any infestors until your Pathogen Upgrade is 30 seconds into the research timing. I see many people just kind of wing it around the halfway mark. Its 50 seconds to build an infestor and 80 seconds for the upgrade. (You can check timing by hovering over the bar the tracks how much time has elapsed into the research). This ensres that every infestor pops with a healthy amount of energy (aka enough for a fungal right off its uh ""birth"")

-To efficiently spread creep fast

-Is you fast expo getting denied? If your going hatch first build (I normally do against all t or p) try to fake a gas + pool build. When you see the scout coming into your base and you hatch has not started construction, ninja my way out of my base and build the hatch.

-Cross-positions on a map allows you to stay very macro-orientated because spines can usually finish if you are actively scouting the enemy army until he moves out. (Having a small group of lings run in the moment he moves out also gives you more time to prepare a defense and usually does good damage)

-Saturation of mineral patches is VERY important. Being able to visually recognize the optimum 2 worker per patch makes it easy for you to understand when to slow worker production and/or expand. Also its okay to overproduce some drones if you are expanding soon or your expo hatch is already in the makes to quickly transfer and get optimum gather time. 

-When you throw down a spire and want to make maximum amount of mutas RIGHT when it hatches, drones, and zerglings. If your spire is almost done, use minerals until you are... lets say 200/500. Then by the time your spire pops, you should be an even 600/600. (Mineral obviously collects at a faster rate). Another thing to keep in mind is DON'T GET SUPPLY BLOCKED or USE TOO MANY LARVA BEFORE. I have face palmed so many times because of these two issues.

1349895940.0,119lko,5 Ways Macroing Well Will Get You Promoted,IsomerSC,65,14,28,"Entaro Adun

Someone just asked me for advice on how to get to Diamond from Plat, and struggled to get a promotion to Masters for about a year, I know the negative feelings and frustration that can come in. You feel like you'll never make it, you get more anxiety to play 1v1 because every loss takes you farther from your goals, and then you play worse because of the anxiety.  
  
But back up a second and think: promotion is not about emotion. Promotion is about getting better and winning a majority of games against people in your league and around 50% of games in the next league up. If you want to make Masters
  
Macroing better is the by far the easiest and fastest way to improve your play and to win games. I still lose many games because my macro messed up and I am mid-Masters now. I don't want to belabor this introduction any more
  
1. **Macroing well allows you to pick safer builds.**  
If you know you can outmacro opponents in your league, whereas if you pick a greedy strategy you open the door for cheese and all-ins to prevent your macro ability from kicking in.  
  
2. **Macroing well makes battles easier**  
If two players have equally powerful armies, engagement control, map awareness, and so forth become really important. However, the more shit you have than your opponent, the less you have to control perfectly. This takes a lot of pressure off of you to get the sickest fungal/storm/emp/concave and should help you win battles a lot more consistently.  
  
3. **Macro applies in all situations**  
Let's say you and your opponent both get into really odd situations. Perhaps you cheese each other and shit gets into uncharted waters. In these situations, on the other hand, helps you no matter the game situation.  
  
4. **Macroing well helps you learn more about the game**  
If you macro properly
  
5. **Macroing well allows you to think about other things**  
In the end, to look at the mini map, to look at your money, etc. If you are focused on putting guys into gas or making SCVs, you will lose mind-time that could be spent on many other things. Muscle memory is key to macroing well and to playing well.  
  
Hope these reasons to macro well will convince you to improve your macro and help you get that promotion. ",,t5_2smn2,False,,race-z,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/119lko/5_ways_macroing_well_will_get_you_promoted/
1337843481.0,u2fgh,A new way at approaching opening builds for bronze-plat players: The Advantage System,NoseKnowsAll,60,9,32,"Hey - just for some background

What I've come up is what I like to call: ""**The Advantage System**""

The advantage system is a way of assessing your opening build and then coming up with a way to remember the important parts of the build so that you execute it correctly even if you are not executing it perfectly.  Obviously

Starcraft 2 is a game that plays out after players have chosen which advantages they want their opener to have.  The three advantages are as follows:

(1) **Economy**

(2) **Tech**

(3) **Army**

Any good opening build, and sacrifices the third in order to power those two advantages more.

**Example 1: 1rax FE -&gt; 3rax+reactored starport TvX**.  This build gets a very fast command center and then powers hard into getting the important bio upgrades and medivacs.  The advantages to this build are economy and tech

**Example 2: 3gate void PvT allin**.  The advantages of this build are both army and tech

**Example 3: 1gate FE -&gt; 3gate DTs PvT**.  This build's advantages are economy and tech

**Example 4: FFE -&gt; 6gate PvZ**.  This build's advantages are economy and army

**Example 5: 1/1/1 TvP**.  This build's advantages are army and tech

**Example 6: 1rax FE-&gt; combat shields push OR 1rax FE-&gt; 6rax no gas TvP**.  Both these builds get economy and army

You might now be saying - ""Great, ***YOU HAVE TO BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THESE ADVANTAGES*** given to you.

For instance, but if you're not constantly building scvs then one of the advantages of the build is instantly gone.  Likewise - if you delay your tech too much with this build (say, by forgetting gas or not placing your factory down on time) then you will again be removing one of the advantages this build is supposed to give you.  It's totally fine to miss a marine here or there (this build doesn't give you army anyway) as long as you are building those workers like crazy and being precise with your factory timing.

Likewise - when you 1/1/1 in TvP, then your tech will be delayed and your army is not going to be big enough for the allin you're preparing to do - no doubt losing you the game.

So now - to all you bronze-platinum players out there who aren't 100% perfect with building scvs/probes or making units out of your gateways/barracks

1) Identify the two advantages your build gives you before you start your next game.  If it doesn't give you two advantages or it's too middle of the road (a reason I believe that 3gate FE in PvT and PvZ is dead)

2) Take advantage of the advantages your build gives you.  Don't stress too much over the third advantage in SC2 that your build doesn't give you

3) Review the game and see how well you took advantage of the natural advantages your build gave you.  Try to find a way to improve on your advantage taking if it's not perfect.

**TL;DR**: SC2 is a game with three advantages: Economy, don't miss scvs for economy builds, don't forget gas/tech for tech builds, and frickin' attack at the correct timings for army builds.

**Final remarks**: Feel free to ask any questions here; I'll be checking this in the upcoming days until Red Bull Battlegrounds.  I'm not sure exactly how this applies to zerg players

As Racemic below noted: ""It's so important to not only understand what the strengths and weaknesses of your own build are, you should play SAFE until your economy kicks in and equalizes the army.""  I would suggest this to all players who fully understand their own build orders now.  Try scouting out what your opponent is doing and categorize his build according to the advantage system too.  Then you can react accordingly knowing that you have a better advantage in one category and disadvantage in another.

Example: You are 1rax FE'ing (eco/tech) vs a 3gate void allin (army/tech).  You have an advantage in eco and a disadvantage in army.  Thus - defend his push with more bunkers/scvs in order to deal with his army,False,,t5_2smn2,1337916225.0,,,t3_u2fgh

-**Ladder Anxiety**: This has been the single greatest factor limiting my own play. It has come and gone - there have been periods in life where I could play without limits
  
For me
-Happier life situation in general  
-Don't think about opponent
-Practice macro against AI every day for 30 minutes you will improve a lot and also I think this helps you to realize that the game has so many things to improve on.  
-You can try to brute force your rage/anxiety and just say ""This is not helping me get better."" but generally I find it's better to acknowledge your emotions

 - Learn to quickly count drone saturation - this is so useful for Zerg as it turns droning from an art into a science. Box-select your mineral drones

 - HOTKEYS MAKE YOU GOSU. Remap 9 to ~ and use it as a hotkey too. As Zerg when you make units, Select Larvae -&gt; Make Lings -&gt; SHIFT+1,  Select Larvae -&gt; Make Infestors -&gt; SHIFT + 2. I hear see people rallying hatcheries to units in their army all the time, I think this is silly. Control group them as you make them and now you are in GSL Code S.

 - I get really affected by nerves and I think it's fair to say a lot of people do. Swallow your nerves and shit out cold steel, once you have speed, fight tooth and nail all the way to your opponent's base. But don't miss injects or you will lose.

- Lategame Zerg - throw down a ton of extra hatches

1323228111.0,n3f2q,ZVZ play tips that I've learned from a zerg ridden ladder,glabius,41,3,16,"I've played a LOT of zvz at diamond level and I've gotten quite good at it its my best MU at around ~~60% so here's some things I think anyone below diamond could learn from (i would expect high diamond/masters to know most of this)

1. Banelings are your friend, and try to keep banes at your base for defense. If you can get a 5+ ling hit from one baneling that can win you the early game. Also during a lingbling war always check corners of your base for secret banes.

2. Tal'Darim always open banelings. I prefer a 13/13 instead of a 14/14 on tal darim because you get them slightly faster and it should be intense. There is no ramp at main so banelings are extra effective (its harder to block banes through a choke etc. without a ramp so banelings are ALWAYS what you should open with on taldarim

3. Two ways can easily put you ahead simply with a drone scout

a. 6-10 pooling

b. Standard 14/14

b. 15 hatch. If you see a 15 hatch

4. Queens are your friend in early game. Two queens can block a ramp of almost infinite zerglings and banelings. 3 Queens can help do a protoss esque wall off that uses the hatch to walloff and an evo/spine. 

5. If you see a blind Roach opening with no banelings, research +1 and take all off gas and mass lings to victory. Some maps roaches can be successful early (shakuras, anitga, maps with more ramps) They will have to make more roaches (not drones) to defend if they go blind w/o banelings, so you can make more drones, have +1 and mass lings if you see that he pushes

6. Overlord placement OL placement. It's crucial. Try to have one on the edge of his base to see units coming out, etc. Keep spreading them out until you get to lair tech. 

7. Mutas. Mutas are a solid choice in ZVZ but how you react to mutas depends. If they're going desperation mutas (i.e they lost a lot of units and want to come back in it by going mutas) then you can either drop a spire yourself if you think you can go a higher muta count, 1-2 spores per base, and make more queens

if the game is slightly even and his spire is more than 1/4 complete

also

Now to the fun part

1. Cheesy build. Good on shakuras, wait for 200 minerals, make two extractors, and make 3 lings. Send 2 drones at 1/2 done of lings to the opponents base make two spine crawlers in their base and harass//defend the spines with your lings. Can get you some easy wins (and some bm!)

2. Speedling Muta, and mass spine crawlers at the small choke at your natural. Get good overlord placement because a lot of zergs will nydus your base if they see this. Quick ASAP to mutas and get a high muta count and take your third. With this you need to get upgraded 1/1 and eventually 2/2 lings/bane comp so you can beat a roach hydra comp at your front door. Spines with transfuse are REALLY good versus roaches so the turtle and tech route is really good especially if they don't tech as fast as you and try to break you.

3. 10 pool into fast expand. (good for ramp w/ choke maps) Go 10 pool, then 3 lings to their base. Also make 1 queen and immediately after make another queen to protect your ramp. Either a or b will happen

a. 10 pool does significant damage

b. 10 pool isn't successful because they scouted or defended ez, natural finished, with 4 queens and more larva. If the other zerg expands then you might be even (still testing this im not sure how good it actually is)

1351625774.0,12cr1b,Terran Mech: Supply Drop vs Mules,NoseKnowsAll,41,4,33,"Yesterday in GSL

When you go mech, why not just calldown supply instead.

The game he did this on can be found: [here](http://www.twitch.tv/gomtv/b/337423377) at around 1hr 30 minutes (Cloud Kingdom TvT).  Note how he doesn't start the supply calldowns until all 3 bases are established.

Pros:

* Calldown supply =&gt; Free 100 minerals in the very very long run.
* Calldown supply =&gt; SCVs not pulled off line to build depots.\
* Not using mules =&gt; You mine out your main 3 bases much slower
* Mules unneeded for a strong 3 base mech push on small maps and not super duper late game focused mech/sky terran play

Cons:

* Mules =&gt; 270 minerals in the very short run that you're missing out on.
* Less macro orbitals =&gt; Can't go for the super late game.
* If the calldowned depots die..... bad times are had by all.

**TL;DR** When going mech in TvT, Happy used supply calldown in the mid game to save minerals.

What do you guys think about doing this?

**EDIT**: I think ClassicThunder and abstinenceee have worded both sides of the argument very well.  So I guess my real question is: do you think it's worth it to sack a couple of hellions to harass with in the mid game in order to gain an extra 1000 minerals in the long run?  Personally,False,,t5_2smn2,1351635081.0,,,t3_12cr1b
1316902705.0,kqd5g,"ZvP Close Positions All-In - ""Rorschach""",StupidFatHobbit,37,4,21,"Close positions are something Z's have to deal with on ladder for whatever ridiculous reason Blizzard thinks is necessary. While ZvT close positions are akin to locking a ballerina in a phone booth with a hungry bear, but it's very strong even if the opponent knows what's coming. The reason I called it the Rorschach is because the first time I successfully pulled it off I wound up typing ""I'm not stuck in close positions with you, I get matched against GM when I'm doing very well but usually wind up playing just the top of masters. Oh

Anyways, and Spine Crawler. Yeah, some of you might see where this is going but HOW you do it is very important. I consider this to be a fairly apm-intensive build, but the more solid your basic mechanics are the easier it will be for you - injects and creep spread are vital to this build's success. So here we go -

Start with 11p so you can fuck up FFE and get the hatch down in a reasonable amount of time as well as getting that first queen out quick. Once the hatch is down...

- Get 100 gas then pull 1 drone out (leaving 2 in)
- Start making queens at both hatches. Do not stop. Ever. 
- Get enough zerglings and a spine or two (depending on his pressure) to secure your nat
- FIRST 25 ENERGY goes to a tumor connecting your main and nat and propagating towards the enemy base
- When you're at about ~100 gas after speedling
- Eventually when you hit 100 gas again

So let's recap. You're expanding, DRONE THE FUCK UP AND DO NOT STOP MAKING QUEENS + DO NOT STOP SPREADING CREEP. And if I actually have to tell you to inject, you should stop reading this guide and go practice more. 

- If he's being dumb and 4gating just throw up some spines make lings and win
- If he's doing some kind of gate pressure expand
- Any kind of FFE should have been solidly fucked up by your 11p
- Get a spore in the middle of each mineral line at around 6:15 or so if he's not expanding and station some lings in each mineral line as well just in case of dt. Also get a spore at your front spines
- Any kind of 1 base air gets stomped by your mass queens

You want to get to 3 lines of drones on minerals on each base (24 per) - this is ""full saturation"" on minerals. Right before you get there (or earlier if you can spare the minerals without cutting queens/drones and without dying) drop an auxiliary hatch in your main. I usually prefer to drop it at the top of my ramp. When it's down

You should be adding spines periodically just to stay safe and keeping only a minimal number of lings initially while you drone up and get those queens and drones. When you near your saturation goal, this is your signal to begin the push - your creepspread should be getting notable and your goal is to get your spines and a ton of queens to the enemy base. You eventually want to have around 10 spines once the push hits the enemy base but you obviously don't want to get all 10 right away when you start. You'll have at least a dozen queens or more. Switch over to pure and constant speedling production (and remember to get your +1/+1, carapace first).

The whole idea is you advance this wall of spines towards his base with the queens backing them up and a creep spread that makes the Indonesian Tsunami look like a fucking glacier. If he tries to break through, so in case he does try a runaround into the natural he's still gotta deal with spines plus the upgraded speedlings plus he's on creep the entire time. And if he doesn't flat out win when he does that (or do crippling damage) he's just going to die very quickly (or be contained for an eternity while you disco your way to victory). Make sure to still scatter your overlords in case of warp prism shenanigans - also keep two near the push so you can see up onto high ground. Two is twice as good as one.

The rest is, keep a spore near them if there's a DT possibility, transfuse like crazy, don't stop making queens and lings. Replace spines if they die but try not to lose them, since you'll have to replace the drones as well. As far as injecting goes, I find it's best to time everything so all 3 hatches queens are completing at the same time, they all inject, but you should fucking know that already!

The lings act as a massive buffer. You want to keep massing them behind the wall of spines and only use them when he sends his units in, make sure you transfuse everything that's getting attacked (the front will turn into a near-continuous battle if the P is good), keep queueing those queens, keep injecting, and keep up the creep spread, and keep making lings. This is why it's somewhat apm-intensive, if you glance away at the wrong time and 3 queens die because they weren't transfused it can really hurt you. Your buildings will be nigh-invulnerable as long as your queens are alive, and you're paying attention. Your lings are expendable

1342854084.0,wwz3y,I win 90% of TvZ in Plat - would be curious if this build works in higher leagues - or just helps others,vic42482,38,3,19,"So I'm only Plat but I feel like since latest patch I've been winning 90% of TvZ pretty easily. It used to be my worst match up

The basis of the build is blue-flame hellions. LOTS OF THEM. But that's not the only thing why it works. Many Terrans stopped going reactor hellions since the patch as they say it's impossible to deal with queens - but that is exactly why I started winning. I just produce MORE hellions. Zergs are getting cocky thinking they can hold hellions with queens and spinecrawlers now

Another main point to the build is to make Zerg produce non-drones AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE and not let them get to the comfortable late game composition.

Finally

* **Phase 1** - mass blue flame hellions

* **Phase 2** - Two-base marine tank push

Here are the details of the build:

**Phase 1**

1. Fake bunker rush with two marines - this is just to get them to produce non-drones. Even if you lose the two marines

2. After 2 marines - factory

3. Tech Lab on barracks right away (for second factory coming up).

4. CC

5. Build second factory as soon as you can afford it while producing reactor hellions - you can start building on top of tech lab left by barracks. Once complete Blue Flame research right away. Constantly pump 3 hellions at a time until Phase 2

6. I build another tech lab on barracks at this time and leave it empty - because you need it for quick tank switch later

7. Reactor on barracks - for marines. Since first two marines

8. Wall off your natural with supply depots and continue scv production.

All of this on one gas.

**What to do with blue flame hellions**

1. Try to run by as soon as you get 4 hellions to scout and see the front. Some zergs don't even make spine crawlers thinking queens can hold everything now.

2. Keep initial small number of hellions by entrance to the natural. Rally the rest hellions slightly behind the first batch. Try to keep the numbers hidden. If queens move out they should see small number at first.

3. As soon as you get to 8-10 hellions, pull back and reinforce with more hellions and try again.

4. If zerg keeps producing lings and queens or even banelings you can overwhelm them pretty fast with constant flow of blue-flame hellions if you kite properly. Sometimes you can win right here. If they think they can beat the hellions with mass queens (which is the main mistake I seen since the patch) - they're wrong as long as you keep pumping 3 hellions at a time non-stop and attack in large numbers.

5. If they're walled off and/or have spinecrawlers - don't try to force it. Sit outside their natural and prevent creep and 3rd base. As long as you're macroing at home you're winning 2 base vs 2 base. If they try to move out with queens, if you kite properly and don't let them get surrounded. At certain point you can even kill spine crawlers with big enough number of BFhellions.

Here are the scenarios from Phase 1 - from best case to worst case:

1. You win by overwhelming them

2. You cripple their economy by killing drones

3. You force them to make non-drones

**When to transition to Phase 2**

The only way zerg can break out of Phase 1 is Roaches or Mutas. As soon as you smell roaches or mutas you need to switch to phase 2. This can be very early - even before BlueFlame is finished (which is fine - because that means they're on weak economy having to make roaches so early), cause they've been on 2 base the whole time - as long as you macro at home you should be ahead.

Try to scan their main to see when switch to Roaches or Mutas is happening - or if you're lucky enough to run into main with hellions and spot it great. You also need to have some timing sense from experience about when to scan. 

If you don't scout Roach Warren early enough - not the end of the world. Once you see roaches popping out try to keep them in their base as long as possible - by retreating to watch towers and then running around roaches and threatening to attack their bases as soon as you see roaches move out. You don't want roaches to attack your base until you get seige mode in Phase 2.

**Phase 2**

1 -While constantly pumping 3 hellions at a time on 2 base

* 3 More barracks (4 total now)

* 2 Engineering bays

* 3 gases (remember you're on 1 gas the whole time)

* Two tech labs on 2 of the 3 barracks you just built.

* Start building marines. I rally them to main base in case mutas unexpectedly appear.

. As soon as you smell Mutas or Roaches

* Stop hellion production

* Switch your factory to the empty Tech Lab you built back in Phase 1. This really comes in handy to start mass Tanks ASAP without waiting to build Tech Lab. Also can save your ass if roaches hit unexpectedly. Good thing about mass hellions - it switches to mass tanks pretty fast.

* Siege mode

* Place 4th barracks on the reactor freed up by Factory. Now you have 2 racks with tech labs

* From this point on mass marines and tanks from 4 barracks and two factories.

* Stim, Plus 1 Armor from 2 tech labs and 2 e-bays.

* No starport - until you move out

* If there are mutas

2 - Once all upgrades finish and you have 6-8 tanks

3 - As you move out build starport and 3rd CC. By this time you can usually afford it. So that even if this timing attack doesn't kill them

4 - Send reinforcments in bunches so they don't get killed off one by one. 

5 - I also don't put any add-on on starport until later in favor of producing medivacs as soon as possible. But first wave of attack without medivacs is usually sufficient as long as you stim just once or twice.

**That's it!**

Most of the times when I lose this match up is because I failed to switch from Phase 1 to Phase 2 effectively by either:

* Missing scouting and reacting too late to Roaches. As soon as siege mode is done you should be safe from roaches. And as long as you build marines in your base

* Messing up my macro while microing BFhellions and end up with bank of minerals - I don't have Master level multitasking :)

* I just mess up the build - again

You may ask what I'm still doing in Plat if I win 90% of TvZ

Piece!

EDIT: Just grabbed 2 most recent replays of this. Sorry I didn't save any good ones when I actually executed it better. So I mess up ALOT in both games, would be much easier.

1320219113.0,lxh49,EGHuk's fast-3rd macro PvZ build,kengou,33,6,21,"[high diamond/low masters]

I've been having a ton of success with this build since I saw and studied it a lot at MLG Orlando.  It keeps Protoss even with the Zerg economy

The gist of the build is this:
Forge FE.
I make 1 zealot and send it straight to Zerg's main to scout.
make nothing but sentries
chronoboost probes a LOT.  almost exclusively
make a total of 6 gates

If Zerg scouts this, and make 6 spines.  This is an added bonus but not at all necessary for success!  If Zerg doesn't scout this or your zealot sees some greedy tech like mutas, you can actually choose to all-in here.

As soon as warp gate finishes, make the 3rd base.  I like to push out at this timing to make Zerg think I'm doing the 6-gate all-in - make sure to include a probe so he'll buy it!

We have to rely on forcefields, we're securing our 3rd.  Zerg has a 3-base economy to pressure, but we have a 2-base economy and 6 gates.  To pressure the expo Zerg has to forgo drones, which is great for us, as long as we survive.

As soon as 3rd base is secure

At this timing is when Zerg's tech will reveal itself.  See a flock of mutas? Start blink and make a templar archives.  See roach pressure? Start that robo bay!  If Zerg hasn't made his presence known at this point, delay colossus production in favor of blink stalkers and possibly psi storm.  The mutas won't deny our 3rd base because it's already up and running.  Just prevent any major damage.

At this point we kind of just sit until we're maxed.  Take a 4th AND a 5th base at this timing while you get aggressive (the main and natural should be drying up soon).  The maxed protoss army is fearful as hell.  You should have 4-5 colossus and a ton of blink stalkers with 8 full energy sentries; OR you should have a bunch of templar with storm, you SHOULD win the game.

Task 1: What is an all-in? While difficult to define
  
Task 2: Identifying an All In Before it Comes  
This is really crucial. If you don't scout an all-in before it comes
The other piece of identifying an all-in, etc.  
  
Task 3: Reaction  
Once you identify it is coming, analyze if that choice was your downfall or if the execution of the choice was your downfall. Here are some examples of reactions:  
  
ZvP: I think a 2+ blink stalker allin is coming
ZvZ: I think a 14g14p ling bane allin is coming against my 15 hatch, make a spine, and bring both queens to my nat.  
PvZ: I see a 7 roach rush coming
  
You see there are ""optimal"" reactions to different allins, but about the present.   
  
General Concepts  
1. When in doubt, which feels like shit and which reduces the efficacy of your practice time. Just play safely so you can get to all phases of the game.  
2. If you see an allin coming, that has happened 3 times in masters), I don't greedily make only 1 spine. I cancel the hatch and make 3. There is NO REASON to do anything except make units and defenses when you see an allin coming.

1329838638.0,pzef1,A Terran on High Templar. Why they aren't imbalanced in TvP and how you stop Protoss late game. Discuss. [X-Post from r/starcraft],julythekon,31,5,9,"So for the past few weeks


Now while all these are true


The main purpose of storm is area control


1) Cost - While the net cost difference between High Templar and Ghosts are a total of 100 resources, are very gas intensive. Gas is a critical resource for any Protoss player. 150 gas is a large investment for any player, and even more so for a Protoss player.


2)Storm - Ever since the KA nerf, they wait a little then its no problem, they can storm. Take into account two things: timings and future battle prospects.


2a) Timings - In TvP games at the professional level, don't expect to win. Terran is based on aggression and harassment. You can also delay the timing of the protoss' HT by harassing with drops. It is difficult to split the Protoss army effectively to deal with drops and be safe at the front at the same time. Use this advantage. Again, Terran needs to be aggressive in the early to mid game. It is an advantage our race has over the other two.


2b) Future prospects - Before the KA nerf, it is still not always possible due to EMP's. Force engagements and bait out storms earlier on in the mid-game so energy stays low for the HT. Again, be aggressive. Do NOT let the Protoss sit back. If you do, its your fault and not an imbalance.


3) Positioning - A lot of the late game in this MU comes down to positioning. It can turn the game in either person's favor even with a significant supply deficit. If you choose to engage on Protoss turf or Protoss terms


4) Unit Composition - Make sure you have a balanced Unit composition. Making a ton of ghosts and no vikings to counter colossus is not good and vice versa. If you lose


5) Unit Control - Probably the most important point and where most Terrans go wrong in this MU. First, scan or build turrets, they are all worth their weight in Gold minerals. Stim at the last minute (right before your engage) and do not overstim. Make sure you engage with a concave. It is much better to back off with a few losses than engage is a bad position and lose the game. Do not be afraid to run back to bunkers, turrets and reinforcements.


5a) Snipe outranges storm and feedback. Make sure you scan the Protoss army consistently and pick off any stray HT. Keep your ghosts near the front of your army and snipe HT right as the battle starts. It gets harder for HT's to feedback as the battle starts so EMP will also work then. Trading a EMP on a bunch of HT is worth taking a storm to just one or two ghosts.


5b) MICRO your MM force back away from the zealots and colossus. Let your vikings do damage to the colossus and focus on keeping away from chargelots. It makes a world of difference.
What the late game comes down to is control and composition. If you say it is much more work on the Terran's part, they have to halt colossus production to make more and are temporarily blind. It is not easy, but the Terran can win engagements.

1347378923.0,zporf,How to Improve your Macro Every Day,IsomerSC,30,4,9,"Hey Everyone
  
Someone posted a question about if there exists some sort of training regiment for Protosses to improve their macro daily. This regiment would basically incrementally increase the macro challenge that you are putting onto yourself and thus ensures you increase yo' skillz over time.  
  
I would not recommend practicing this way for a number of reasons. First of all, so for this reason I would give yourself more general goals such as ""Max out as quickly as possible with only roaches, lings, and drones"" and then see if you can do it in 12, 11:30, or even 11 minutes! For terran, just do marine marauder, just gateway units or stalker/colossus
  
What does this generalized, however we can not fix our common mistakes if we are worried about a timing attack.  
  
So, from the early game to maxed out, focusing SOLELY on macro. Don't worry about scouting, about micro, about unit composition: those things are simply distracting us from perfecting our macro. Just get really good at not getting supply blocked, making workers, spreading overlords/creep, all of those things. If you do this for 30 minutes a day for a couple of weeks, scouting matters less
  
Furthermore
  
So get out there and 1A some very easy computers with maxed armies!

1362068546.0,19ehb0,Cutting worker production at 2 per mineral patch?,Veshan,28,5,17,"I've been running the numbers on the number of minerals brought in per worker

At 16 workers on minerals, the 8 workers add 144 minerals/minute. At a cost of 50 minerals each, this means that adding workers from 16 to 24 gets you .36 minerals/minute for every 1 mineral invested.

Compare this cost-to-benefit ratio to putting those 8 workers on an expansion *including the cost of the expansion*. I'm going to treat the expansion as costing 300 minerals instead of 400 because it gives 10 supply and a pylon cost 100 and gives 8 supply, this means you get .48 mineral/minute for every 1 mineral invested.

So, you get .61 minerals/minute per mineral invested)
So why would you build more than 16 probes per base? One reason might by that you can't expand due to your opponent. But considering how drastically better an investment it is to expand than super-saturate a base

The other reason is if you have an expo building in progress and you want to pre-prepare some workers. This I would definitely advocate because you want to get your ROI going as quickly as possible.
As a final point of comparison, is it really worth the opportunity cost to build probes 17-24 when those minerals mean your army is that much smaller?

**SO** we've all seen the new HoTS patch

Lets start out by looking at the buffs to each unit:

---

**The Oracle:**

It now attacks ground units

I did some testing in the unit tester to see how the unit fared in fights. this is what I found:

&gt;So I was curious about how well the oracle could be used in a straight up fight. I'm in the unit tester now and testing with 0 micro from both sides. So far I've found:

&gt;**Oracle vs Hydra:** Oracle seems to always win a 1:1 fight (supply wise) with hydras. The oracles were 1 armor 1 shield

&gt;**Oracle vs Marine:** With 33 supply of oracles 0/0 vs 33 supply of marines 0/0 (combat shield+stim) the oracles won with 6 supply left. With 3 armor 3 shield oracles vs 3/3 marines (shield+stim) and both at 102 supply

&gt;**Oracles vs Marine+Medvac:** With 81 supply each


&gt;So obviously the biggest thing is oracles cost a LOT more than any of these other units. Still for the most part they win by a massive landslide which means that air toss might be a possibility. It's cool to see that they are so strong against T1+T2 light units. 

&gt;The biggest thing is it seems like the oracle doesn't benefit from weapon upgrades so they aren't going to be as strong in a fully upgraded fight. They seem perfectly good though (A lot better than I thought) in a straight up fight though early.

Copy and post from something I posted on TL. As I mentioned the oracle pretty much beats any light unit in a 1:1 supply fight. A lot of times they win quite well. The downside is that the oracle is an expensive unit

---

**The Void Ray:**

It now no longer charges up

So testing in the unit tester I've found this out:

&gt;**Void Ray vs Corruptor:** With 42 supply voids, the voids win with 30 supply left.

&gt; With 90 supply of void rays vs corruptors

&gt;**Void Ray vs Hydralisk:** With equal cost for each side (69 supply void vs 122 supply hydra

&gt; With equal *supply*

&gt;**Void Ray vs Marine:** At 30 supply with equal supply the void ray wins with 12 supply left. (30 supply vs 30 supply). (Both sides max upgrades

&gt; It's a bit too difficult to really test an ""equal cost"" because of the huge cost difference. Marines generally will win an equal cost fight though.

&gt;**Void Ray vs Marine/Medvac:** With the same upgrades + medvac upgrade

&gt; Using equal supply of void ray vs medvac/marine the med/marine wins with 27 supply (still new upgrade).

---

So those are the two main tests so far that I've done. With that info

Sorry for the really long post but hopefully you guys found it interesting. If anyone else has tested stuff so far let us know.

I for one have a solid idea of what my opponent is up to

For all the success of zerg players at the tip top of sc2, it just feels like a fucking cheese zerg metagame right now. however, this often not the case. I see 4 stalkers coming to my third and i start preparing for a 7 gate that never comes, or 12 marines run into my nat at 7-8 min (I don't even know exactly, which is the point of this post), and a third is behind it. essentially what I'm getting at is, 200 points ago, where-as now they don't miss a beat with their macro.

So t and p are pressuring way more than i'm used to and I don't know how to respond besides gearing up pressure of my own. except for 2 rax, is that 100% an expo? if i see no hellions is that heavy bio pressure? I've passed the point where if something hasn't hit at a certain time, its not because my opponent is bad, its because he's doing something different. I just need pointers as to what it is without an ol flying over the entire base, because even the jet pack ol's can't get you enough info on most maps. or hell, if you have ol scouting tips let me know. 


ok guys

zvt:
15/16. 28/28 double ol, 6 roaches, 1/1, lair, baneling nest. take third vs banshee hellion/ lose third to 2base mass bio, proceed to mid game vs macro terran(this doesn't exist except condemned, daybreak, that i can proceed with lair tech or preempt banelings before 9:30. or its one of those rax/expo/rax things that sends a dozen rines at 7 minutes that kills queens and forces a shit ton of lings. just constantly over prepared or under prepared and suddenly it makes a fuck ton of difference. What is the minimal defense i can make against 2 base bio medevac? when can i expect my opponents third? if I lose my third is it gg? if i expect heavy bio

zvp:
no idea what i'm doing. lol. basically try to survive all ins and pump muta when i see third go down cuz its usually with a robo. only success has been defending the pressures, they know we know, and the only way to win is to base trade or be stephano. biggest question here is identifying if chrono spent on pressure leads to gateway all in or expo. i love 11 pool to force gw and cannon before nexus, but still feel like any attack before hive will likely kill me. I've tried, roach infestor, but this still doesn't beat gateway immo in open ground, and you have to replenish constantly to stay alive. unless you can outright break protoss with roach max

So please please please, and that coupled with nat gas timings for how all inish it is. Against toss I would like to know what you can infer based on pressure builds, like zealot count, coupled with nat gas timing and how the hell you know whether or not its an all in follow up or expo.

First 3 chronos are used consecutively on the nexus. The next two are used on warp gate. The next chrono is used on your 2nd sentry. From here you will have to decide if you need more probes (vs a 1 rax FE perhaps)

You make a zealot

Scout with the probe used to make your gateway. This probes job is just to find out the spawn location of terran. Seeing gas timings is just a bonus. Try not to lose it!

Your third pylon must be overlooking your natural expansion! This is for your first warp in

Leave your stalker outside his natural! This is super important! You need to see when he's moving out. You can bring this stalker home when your observer gets to his base.

**THOUGHTS:**

This build is very ""tight"". It relies on hitting all your timings well, and will allow you room to grow into the build. Easy to learn, but difficult to master.

In PvT, and the ever so much fun 1-1-1. Let's talk about the most common opening first.

***

**RESPONSES:**

Since I'm focusing on the opening

[**The 1 Rax FE:**](http://drop.sc/161581)

You are going to be safe, or for a naked 4/5 rax with a ton of marines (build a lot of sentry stalker, and force field the marines away). 

[**The 2 Rax Pressure with Concussive Shell:**](http://drop.sc/122270)

You are going to have to pull probes. The timing for this works out in such a way that when  when the terran gets to your base is when you are transferring your probes from your main to your natural. Use the 2 stalkers that you just warped in (along with the 5 probes you transferred and the 1 zealot, and focus marauders with stalkers. Once you hold it off, you can play standard, or go all-in off 4 gates (only works on maps that don't have a ramp at the natural).

[**The Ever So Much Fun 1-1-1:**](http://drop.sc/161594)

Use your first observer to scout the 1-1-1. From here you want to get a total of 6 gates, use GUARDIAN SHIELD, focus tanks with immortals, and focus banshees with your stalkers. A-move your zealot/sentry force (try to get the zealots coming in from behind, sandwiching them in between the tanks so they can't micro). If possible, try to lead with an immortal to take damage from the tanks. 

**Marine + SCV All-ins:**

These come in many flavors, and focus down the marines, pulling probes when necessary. Use the probes to surround the marines, and focus down marines with your stalkers. You probably scouted this with the stalker outside his ramp, so you need to kite the forces all the way back to your base. Every little bit of damage helps. Once again, the key to handling the marine/scv all-in is STAYING CALM, make units


**CC First:**

This build is pretty much like the 1 rax FE, and instead chrono out units from my gateway. You want to get to the same point (2 gates + robo + expand), but you also want some units to pressure early. I chrono out 2 zealots and stalker. I start my attack with the first zealot, and keep rallying units to his expansion. This can force terran into a bad spot, since their bunker is delayed quite a bit by going CC first. I don't try and kill them, just make them feel super awkward. Then I transition into the standard game. Alternatively, you can take all your probes off gas, it's just the other end of the spectrum.
***

**THE NITTY GRITTY** *(or what separates a good opening from a great opening)* **:**

In this section I'll be going over very specific details of how to execute this build. I've included a video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8ov91Y5p9E), so it's best not to rely on getting into the base. If you're a lower league player, you don't need to focus on this section immediately. Once you have correctly done all the basic steps in the previous section (ie: not missing chronos, not forgetting anything, etc.) you can move onto this! 

1 - Chronoboosts. Fairly simple here. Chrono on 10 supply

2 - Nexus rallies. To get the tightest and fastest build possible, and send it to your gas gyser, which should be finishing now. At the same time you should rally your 16th probe into your gas gyser, and take only 1 probe off mining to put into gas. After rallying to the gas gyser, you want to rally your 17th probe to build a cyber core. As you can see,  from 15 supply to 17 supply, you only take one probe off mining, you can rally to build your 3rd pylon. Not really necessary at this point though.

3 - When your zealot pops is approximately the time an scv will be in your base. If there is, scout the inside of your base, all the way to the edges, then the natural. If you STILL don't see an scv, patrol around the entrance to your natural. You really don't want to miss a bunker going down, that is not good. I know i didn't do this scouting in the FPVOD, it slipped my mind because i knew a computer wasn't going to bunker rush me. &gt;:)

4 - Your first pylon

5 - Scouting with your zealot + stalker. Think of the zealot as a meat shield to keep your stalker alive. If it's a 2 rax, so i want it to tank more damage. If you see no bunker and 4-5 marines, you can sacrifice the zealot for some marines. If you see a bunker, run away. can't do anything. If you see nothing, go up to his main ramp and do the same thing. If you see a bunker and no marauders, it's probably a 1-1-1. 

6 - Mining close mineral patches. As soon as you can

7 - Building placement. In the early game, when you're dealing with 2 drops, his main army, and you need to drop 8 gates. Take the time early game, and you will thank yourself late game.

***

I'm sure I forgot something, and I'll try to answer and edit this post accordingly.

1373307690.0,1hvngd,Having Problems Practicing? How about a Formula and Some Tips!,bauski,32,9,7,"Hey Guys


I was surfing r/sc and saw a thread asking how to start playing more games

**Intro**

Just like working out, but what you need, good sir, is a way to do reps.

Here is a formula


**The Warm Up**

1. Play 1 game vs the AI. Play as slowly and smoothly as possible. Don't click randomly and extraneously.

2. Play 3-5 games on unkranked now using the same principles as before.


**The Planning**

3. Alt-Tab out of the game, or what specific new thing you want to try. Right it down and think about some ways to go about it.

4. Take a 20 minute walk (around 4 blocks) and think about your games and your goal for today. Concentrate on breathing.


**The Practice**

5. Play 3 games on ranked.
6. Watch said games.
7. Right down a quick improve on each of them.
8. Take a walk around the block

Rinse and repeat until you get frustrated.


**The Cool Down**

9. Play 1-3 game of anything else but 1v1 ranked or arcade games. I suggested doing cheese builds or off racing on unranked, 4v4, or ffa.

10. Think about your games for the day and write down a little note for tomorrow on what you might want to practice.


**Theory Behind the Practice Schedule and Explanation**

At the minimal, and 1 fluff game. At the most, you can fill a whole day with practice.

You start with an AI game so that you can start by ignoring off the scale crazy builds. Starting this way paves a clear mind state once you start playing against real people. 

You play as slowly and smoothly as possible to warm your hands as well as to bring your APM down to the necessary requirement. Just jumping in at maximum velocity is how many people get injured in sports. One of the causes of arthritis is caused by frequent repetitive movements of the hand. Be sure to take care of your hands, etc. Spamming APM for spamming sake also spams into your muscle memory for actually necessary movements.

You play the first 3 games unranked so that you don't worry so much about ladder points. For many of you it won't matter if it's unranked or ranked

We go into the games with an open mind here so that we can look at all possible weaknesses we hold. Don't worry about what is acceptable or not. Cheese, just choose and build and then engage, focus on playing slow and smooth.

Once you're done we watch and write about it. Just doing that alone will improve your games by 2 folds. You want to set up a goal for the day so that winning isn't the only thing that matters. Smaller more realistic goals let you go beyond wins and losses and make you focus on things that can actually improve your skill.

The first twenty minute walk is important. Every other walk afterwards can be shorter

When you start doing the reps

The reason we don't want to be distracted by other things is the same reason people training for marathons do not just stop in the middle of their run and start eating McDonalds. Your mind is in a certain mode

To reiterate

Finally the games at the end are for fun. If you end up frustrated


**Other Tips**

Once you get to 8+ reps a day

Try playing 3 games once, and then back down to 3. If that turns out to be cake, try going up all the way to 11. I encourage that after each set, you take longer breaks to study and walk.


If you are not already auto matching to Elite AI I suggest you play the AI for the first 3 warm up games



If you find it hard to get about a certain amount of reps


Hope this helps you guys.

So today I think I'll talk about what I've been doing in each match up and share the things that have been working well for me

*The Build Skeleton*

1. 1 Rax to Expand and then a gas right after.
1a. Tech lab for combat shields.
2. 2+ Rax and then the 2nd gas is taken.
2a. 2 reactors for marines.
2b. If Against protoss 1 more tech lab and 1 reactor instead.
3. 2 staggered engineering bays for 1/1
4. Marine push at around 8 minutes to test their strength.
4a. Expand while pushing
5. factory

From there on out it really depends on what the other person is doing, and overall just middle of the road, which can be good sometimes, and bad other times. 

*Why 1 Build?*

The reason I have been sticking to 1 build against everything so because I have been trying to focus myself on improving tiny skills right now. The more restraints you put on yourself

If I had too much freedom

*Some of the Things I feel have Improved*

1. My Game sense is much better.
1a. My timings have become crisper.
1b. My compositions have become more refined.
1c. I see their weaknesses and openings and lot better now.
1d. I have become less afraid of pushing out and taking map control.

2. My macro has also gotten better.
2a. Less supply blocks because I know when my population will boom
2b. More command centers for expansions.
2c. Better late game management of upgrades and production.

3. My army micro has definitely gotten better.
3a. Forced to use small groups in my timings to be economical.
3b. Forced to deal with strong tier 3 armies with my bio balls.
3c. Ghosts are key if you want to beat some late game stuff.


*Timings*

**Marines**

Because of the build I've been doing

Just as a side note, and as you're moving around, if you need more units, you should definitely try to combine your armies as you can. The bigger the mental pressure you build on the zerg as he delays his 3rd or loses it, the stronger footing you will have.

If your marines even survive until the stim timing

But remember, the better you're off.


**drops**

Because of my movement with my marine stuff, because my very first reason for turning terran from random was for the drops. I've recently been using drops much more for end game moments. 

One specific instance that has paid off every time is the late game drop after a big battle straight into the zergs base. Especially around tier 3, making it harder for them to surround my units. Around that time I can pump out so much of my bio ball at once, that I don't feel bad about doing a semi-doom drop of 4 or 5 medivacs full of stuff, leaving them there, and when the zerg starts walking in, just leaving the guys and jetting my medivacs back home. With that much stuff, the pool is going down, perhaps a spire

Protoss have been more of a problem with drops, making most drops not really worth it. I think if I refined my drop micro better, it wouldn't be so bad.


*Build Order After Step 5*

I wanted to explain my over all early game and mid game strategy before we went into step 6 in my build order. It heavily depends on my army surviving and me knowing what kind of stuff have made because of my bio ball. Normally it doesn't change very much these days though. Apparently there is no 1 real answer to bio ball

From Zerg I have seen a lot of muta, although I've been pushing them so early these days, that they seem to have trouble getting the mutas up recently. I have no dealt with roaches and hydras much.

From Protoss I have seen either the early 3 gate push, and then go into oracles, and then go into robo, and they usually do a lot of economic damage against me, but I feel as I get better with my scouting and timings, I'll learn to defend against it with no problems.

Either or, I've been skipping widow mines and just making hellbats. With zerg I do less marauders, and with protoss I do more, but either way it's been really good. And since a lot of Zerg's who go muta ling-ling have been going ultras at the end, I think I'm going to try and go ghosts for my late game as I do in protoss. I'm going to see if snipe can put down these freaking ultras even with the way old snipe nerf. I have yet to find a good way to kill all of them at the end. The most success I've had against ultras has mostly been base trading.

[Here is a video from Team Liquid to help you and me with proper ghost management](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=155732)

If Ghost turn out not to be the answer against ultralisks


Against Protoss ghosts have been incredibly helpful. The cols I can take care of with good macro and production but high templars can destroy my bio ball like no other. The games where I have won with good ghosts have been incredibly satisfying. I am still kind of reluctant to make ghosts too early


A friend of mine has suggested I slowly try to introduce mines into my build so I guess I will try to at last make 2 each game


Hope this helps somebody out there.

Back then it was super common to pull a one base all in and based on micro/the build your opponent was going for it made for an interesting early game.

Example old school build: 
Protoss:
One base 4gate
Terran:
3rax stim push
Zerg:
Eh they never really one based successfully.. but their successful early game pushes were 7 roach rush or bling roach bust I suppose.

Are these kinds of builds just archaic now? I play random and so I often try various builds on all races. And honestly, hit the 10 minute mark, and then get a 3rd or think about a slight push. Most games now are very macro and long term oriented.

It's been my go to opening for zvz on ladder because it stops all the cheesy zvz openings and can do damage to a 14/14 or 15 hatch. 

**The Build**

10/10 Drop Pool
2x drones (1 extractor trick)
11/10 OL
11/18 x3 zerglings x1 Queen
16/18 x1 zergling
17/18 x1 zergling
18/18 OL
18/18 double extractor trick for second queen
18/26+ DRONES 
in response to whatever the other zerg may do
20-26/26 take a Gas.
20-26/26 make Another queen if you see units Start to come towards your base
20-26/26 begin spine at edge of base for extra ramp defense and to move down to your inevitable expansion

2nd Queen should start right after the 1st queen (with a double extractor trick) 


**Concepts of the build**
1. The 10 pool build will stop all forms of Cheese. When I do it and the opponent 6-9 pools

2. Significant damage can be done to a 15/15 hatch/pool and 14/14 Gas/pool. If you Kill at least 2 drones I would maybe call it even

3. You force your opponent to make lings while you are making drones from a faster injected hatch. When they see your 10 pool in their base their response is shit shit make lings. Throw your lings around their base the whole time while you macro. They will make more and more lings while sitting at maybe 12/12 drones expecting Another all in while you sit behind 16+ drones after your wave of lings

4. Queen blocking and Mass queens. Most certainly your opponent will think ""well his all in failed

tl;dr kill at least two drones with 10 pool. force an all in

**Other good general ideas to go along with this build**
1. Keep an overlord at their Natural

2. Send a drone scout if you can't find the location of their base with overlords or educated guessing.

3. Keep making queens

4. Start creep spread with your second queen to move to the Natural (I recommend only one creep tumor because you will want the energy for transfuse later)

5. Try to expand

6. If they went 15/15 expand after you do damage to them (you should be able to take out at least 4 drones versus a 15/15

6. Be prepared to be all inned or cheesed later back.


**How to respond to...**

**Mass ling/Baneling on 1 base** - If after your 10 pool they try to bust you with Mass ling or baneling

**Mass ling/Roach, and attempt to expand behind failed Mass ling) drop an evo chamber and get +1. +1 speedlings will decimate his lings and roaches that are probably about to come out sooner or later.

**Fast Expand** Probably the strongest response to this build (Which no ONE rarely ever does because they are expecting a Super all in. Expand yourself with a sort of protoss-esque wall off with queens couple spines and evo chamber with hatchery to make a wall. Play it out like you normally would zvz.

**So your 10 pool was succesful

Keep scouting his base

**How to lose using this build**

1. If you lose your Queen block (and you dont have a third queen or lings to back up

2. You send lings to the wrong base. 

3. You keep making lings instead of drones after initial ten lings. If you keep making lings its just more of an all in. This is an eco 10 pool. If you keep making lings you turn it into a shitty 10 pool all in with no gas making it even suckier.

So I used to play SC like...a lot. Finally got a new computer and monitor last week, I have always been a Zerg player at heart. I've played a couple vs AI games to try and figure out the new zerg units, but there's so much new stuff it's a bit overwhelming. What are some good basic Zerg strategies that will help me learn the new units? I'm kind of hitting the wall learning curve wise and don't want to play a ton of games getting owned until I figure it out.

Any other tips or strategies are very welcome. Also, I feel like I'll be pretty capable once I wrap my head around the new units. Take me under your wing! :P

1322759610.0,mwazo,PvZ Mutalisk,PuritySC,25,1,26,"Hi there

Mutalisks are frustrating due to the nature of Protoss. You have to have a reasonable number of cannons per mineral line [at least 3 for each 8-10 mutalisks] to adequately give time to defend [even with blink Stalkers] against the harass, because a quick snipe can possibly depower 1-2 structures with only a couple pylons, or a longer snipe can depower 5-6 structures if you have 3-5 pylons powering them, especially once the mutalisk swarm gets to the point of 16+, where pylons are sniped fairly instantaneously. 
The other issue I have is the Sim City problems. Moving in and out of your base is always a pain due to the nature of PvZ where every build requires that you ""turtle"" to a degree and this makes dealing with mobile air incredibly difficult. Any zerg with half decent control will be able to kill things in your base and you just have to accept it.
So blink stalkers seem to really be the only option, 3 zerglings can kill one stalker quite easily, although vacuums are not good places to test, the idea of 75minerals for 125 minerals and 50gas explains why using Stalkers to defend zerglings is a bad idea. But either way, the issue I have is that Stalkers vs Mutalisks is a pretty even fight unless you have the numerical advantage. A horde of 20 mutalisks can definetly dispatch 15 stalkers in a straight up engagement WITHOUT zergling support. But alas, the issue I'm having is not dealing with them in an engagement, it's the complete void of map control once mutalisks are out for the remainder of the game which allows zerg to comfortably expand at will while Protoss struggles to get a third/fourth up. Even blinking forward to snipe mutalisks by catching them out of position is rather futile, nor can I expect him to not use his mutalisks and their incredible speed to exploit every tiny nook and cranny that invariably exists in my defense.

I don't want to say Mutalisks are imbalanced, you can guardian shield and then a moderate group of stalkers can actually deal with mutalisk in a straight up engagement [assuming no zerglings] but even then one volley from a reasonable number of mutalisks will instantly snipe sentries. So what should I do? Open double stargate phoenix until Heart of the Swarm and I get the tempest? Go storm and hope the zerg is dumb enough to leave his 120HP mutalisks in the storm for a full second so I can get 20 damage on them, while he snipes my templar for 150 gas each? Or should I hallucinate void rays and hope he insta-ggs? It feels so hopeless.

1366242663.0,1ckj6z,Thoughts as a Terran for the Month of April,bauski,25,4,6,"This might just be drivel

Wow Muta-bane-ling is hard. They have so much map control. Watched a Daily today


**Some key stuff I found useful in the daily:**

**A Game between 2 mobile armies, letting you come in and deny specific things or destroy key structures.

**As a mobile terran army I need a good place to cut back to.** Taeja was always cutting back. He also had a really good map sense in knowing where to hit and make lines. Again Map vision is really huge.

**The Production buildings are the back bone of a Terran army** It was kind of mind opening for Day9 to say that. It made me realize how important it is for me to know what stuff I had back home and what kind of final army I was going for.


**A bunker with marines and some nicely placed supply depots maybe much better for defense than widow mines**. Day9 talked about it in his daily and I think he's right. I would much prefer to have a bunker for defense I think.


All in all I found it to be quite a good daily.


I also watched GSL Code S


It was interesting to see the amount of drops that Gumiho was trying to use


**Saving Medivacs is IMPORTANT. If you can save the units inside


Kind of along the same lines: **Don't over commit to attacks/harass.** There is never a good reason to try gamble your way up to 12 drone kills while losing 6 hellions. Cause it might lead to 4 hellion losses with no drone kills. If it's too dangerous just back off. But in cohesion with this idea I think it's important to **always keep prodding at the outside for weaknesses**


**Drop Harass with 6 marines and 1 widow mine vs Zerg** Oh man



Sadly I can't remember much else from the GSL. They were some very enjoyable games though. Definitely worth watching over again. I'm becoming really fond of Terran.



Lastly somethings I want to focus on today when I get home I think. I mean


**I need to make 3 build orders to stick to** I only switched to Terran after having played Random for so long. I've just kind of done things in a reactive way and just focusing on macroing better, take out the random things more, so that I can improve systematically in the small things. 


I've been, it's just been all sorts of willy nilly stuff.


Against all three races I will be wanting to go for a bio drop kind of play. Once they get too overly defensive then I""ll have to push into a kind of parade push. So I'll be focusing on two different kinds of attack method.


So I'll need at least 5 rax by 2 bases


*Siege Tank vs Mines*

I want to get better with mines, and muta harass but that's about it.


In fact, in all three matches, with the reactor, pump out 6 mines so that I can place 2 at each of my bases and then either go into hellbats or tanks. (I am unsure of how sure I am about this strat, but we'll see after a couple games)


*Upgrades*

So lets see, so that I can do some timed marine pushes early on. I've found those to be quite helpful. Then I'll want stim aftewards, and then I'll be going into factory and starport. I think I'll want to start my upgrades before I start putting down my factory. I think even without healing having 11 marines with stim can be quite deadly in sketchy situations.


*Timings*
But the early marine pushes


Around my 3rd expansion is when I'll either be hit by mutas, or switch to seige tanks if they are going colls.


While writing this I've realized how reactive this all sounds. ""If he does this


Lets go back to the 11 minute mark. I'll have pushed with marines once, I'll be going 2/2, and I'll have just put down my third base and out down 2 mines behind my base.


What do I do from there?


What can I do to take control of the game and force Protoss or Zerg? Drops will be good to keep them on their back toes


Well, so the only thing is to question what I'm adding into it for different build...


I think I'm going to keep it really simple for now. If TvT I'll go tanks


So I think I've figured out all the things I want to do...


**TLDR**

The following will be what I practice for the next couple of weeks:

1. Try to have/keep good map vision

2. Have a good strategic location that can easily access many places.

3. Use Bunkers for Defending bases

4a. Harass constantly

4b. Value units over dealing damage

~~4c. 6 Marines and 1 widow mine~~

5. Push Marines at 7, get upgrades, Expand when the drops start

6. Tank against Terran,,False,,t5_2smn2,False,,True

While I post here all the time and play a ton of SC2, the way I made it was basically by accepting I have ladder anxiety and practically working around it so I could still succeed. I did this by practicing my macro against AI and in the YABOT, by playing custom 1v1s, and by slowly ramping up the amount of 1v1s I play. 
  
Here's what I did daily to get the promotion. Try it out and see if it helps you get the skills you need to be promoted.  
  
Day 1: Research and pick one build per matchup. Use it for this training regiment.    
Week 1: One hour of macro practice on YABOT and against the AI.  
Week 2: 30 minutes macro practice
Week 3: 15 minutes macro practice
Week 4: 5 ladder 1v1   
  
Total amount of ladder games: 63 , which can be useful additions to your improvement if you play FOCUSED on improvement. Rather, these 5 hours a week are STRICTLY FOCUSED ON IMPROVEMENT.

I'll share two of my own. They are both related to one another in that one can be used to transition into the other. 

The first involves a fast lair (after securing an expansion and possible third with regular queen/spine/speedling/baneling defense as necessary). While upgrading the lair, I research the roach speed. Then, I grab all of the gas I have accumulated and make about 3-6 swarm hosts (depending on how much gas I have). Then, I make roaches non-stop. When I accumulate enough, I move across the map and siege up either the third or the natural, using the swarm hosts to help bolster engagements. My reinforcements are mostly speedlings and occasionally roaches. If they go for a quick third, they almost always die. If they tech to air (banshees, or muta)

This one can be an extension of the previous, swarm hosts with longevity upgrade, speed hydras, infestors, and vipers. The roaches, hydras, locusts, and this composition works well against all three races. Now, and is more mobile than the traditional brood lord/corruptor/infestor of most late games.

Basic build order:

* 12 barracks

* @barracks finish: 2 marines

* If no-Zealot: Gas @75 mins while continuing to make marines/SCVs
* While continuing to make SCVs and marines
* @2nd rax finishing: tech lab on first rax
* @100 gas
* Continue to produce SCVs and marines. Once you have ~16 marines
* @~125 gas
* Start stim when Combat Shield finishes. Start 3rd gas.
* As pushing
* @fact finish: Starport. Start 1st Engy bay for upgrades (+1 weapon)
* Once at base, but focus on getting sentries. Once you know you are overrun and can't escape, focus probes.
* From here

This build is generally safe. It can hold off 3gate robo all-in, as long as you respond with appropriate bunkers and such. You are powering up and so will have a good amount of units.

It is strongest against middle of the road tech builds

Most important part of the build is the pressure. Losing all of your marines for very little puts you pretty far behind. To avoid this

I likely am leaving some parts out. Later parts of the build are quite game dependent

1367597415.0,1dmj5z,How to Learn from Professional Games,IsomerSC,30,9,9,"Hey Starcraft Strategy
  
It's been a long time since I wrote anything here. I was a Masters Zerg in WOL and did a bunch of casting
  
The first thing to understand about professional matches is that players understand each other's style and are often-times ""meta-gaming"" each other. This means they do a build which is specifically designed to have a timing against their opponent's style from previous matches. Sometimes
  
Does this mean that if you steal their build order it won't work on ladder? Of course not. Any professional build order will work better than doing random things which are not optimized by a top 100 player. However
  
The second thing to understand is variation of a build order. Each pro build order has a dozen or more variations based upon what he scouts. This is crucial because every ""build order"" you see is really a variation based upon scouting information. There will be a skeleton or frame, maybe one game he gets a void ray, another game he hides his phoenix before moving out, another game he sends them individually. These are situation-specific variations that you'll only truly comprehend by watching multiple executions of the build.   
  
If you watch Day9 analyze someone's build, you could cannon the hatchery or you could go Nexus - Gate - Cannon because you know he won't have the faster lings. That's a variation. There are literally dozens of variations each build could have, from slight changes such as the order of the buildings you produce, to large changes like deciding to go all-in or to switch unit compositions.  
  
So, you will be ready to play it against humans. You will start to see the strengths and weaknesses of the build, which is where variations can help you. You can now go back and **watch the scouting of the pro player** and you will be able to understand the reason they go into different variations, which will teach you how to react and go from a build-order copying machine into a reactionary human!  
  
Cheers
  
http://www.gosubuilds.com/  
  
It doesn't have variations, Nose usually links games or at least provides the player name, so you can look for their variations yourself.

Hi

Recently I have started trying out my muta/ling ZvT style in ZvP, archons, and blink stalkers have been unable to do much. The biggest difference so far that I have seen is that this style of ZvP plays extremely different than other styles I have used in the past. It is not geared towards greedy play (like most zerg is) and actually is quite safe because of this. Currently the way I play it is: 

-Extractor trick into 11 overlord  
-11 Pool  
-15 Queen  
-17 2 Zerglings  
-18 Overlord  
-18 Gas  
-Expand  

From here the build is more or less fluid. You mine 100 gas and get ling speed, take your 2nd, 3rd, and 4th gas while teching to lair and keeping saturation. During this time extra minerals should be going towards a small number of zerglings, an evolution chamber, and spine crawlers. Additionally place a spore down if you think your opponent is going DTs.  

Once lair completes, do not feel you need to go super drone crazy with this. In most of the games I played until I had my 4th and 5th up, I was behind in workers. If you have gotten to this point, you should be able to win it relatively easily (against normal unit compositions).  

Once your mutalisks are out, and making sure to upgrade your mutalisks. For upgrades on mutalisks I typically get a 2nd spire about halfway through my first carapace upgrade for double ups. Just continue building your flock, do critical damage to their infrastructure when they try and move out (tech buildings, pylons), since your spines will buy you the time you need to do the damage. From there destroy their army and remax.  

Now I have been testing this against my diamond/masters protoss buddies

&gt;Mass Archons/HT  

By the time you get any significant number, storms do little good against good mutalisk players since they will always keep their mutalisks spread and make sure to magic box. The best situation you will be in against proper control is you will have to storm your army since his mutalisks are parked above you.

&gt;Mass Phoenix  

This does not work for a few reasons. The first is corruptors. 6 Corruptors will ruin phoenix

&gt;Standard Gateway  

This composition as a whole is not flexible and really cannot deal well with mutalisk harass.  

&gt;Mass Upgraded Blink Stalker  

This composition does the best out of all of the ones so far

&gt;Mass Sentries

Good for fighting off small-medium numbers of mutalisks

&gt;6 gate  

With the delayed third and the large number of spines

What may work:  

&gt;Blind stargate openings.

My friends are not very good with stargate openings, but there is a good opportunity to deal massive damage and get ahead.  

&gt;Blink stalker/phoenix.  

You may be asking yourself why this would work if mass blink stalker and mass phoenix by themselves would not work. The reason is because the following playstyle I describe is far different from styles currently employed by protoss. First of all, you are making large numbers of phoenix and expanding. Should your zerg opponent show up with mutalisks, warp in 10 stalkers for them to deal with (along with the cannons that are already there) while getting your phoenix back to that location to help. Once the threat is diverted, use those stalkers to go counter-harass. And please note that I have been unable to do much testing against this style. In short, it is theorycraft.  

So how are you guys going to counter this? And please

Strengths:

*Very high DPS -  *26.7 DPS

*Tough to kill -  *Base 2 armour

*Easy to kite with -  *The interceptor mechanic allows for engagement from 8 to 12 range

*Cost -  *Taking into account build time and strength

Weaknesses:

*Tech requirements -  *Needs a fleet beacon!

*Build time - *120 seconds - longest in the game.

*Speed - *Sluggish

So

So far the only good strategy I've found is as a counter for mech Terran

Against both I go 3-gate into stargate, they will assume it was a hallucination.

If a one base tank push is coming

If a 1-1-1 is coming, until they have enough to one ro two shot the Carriers - If they've been going that hard into Vikings, your ground army will win.

A note on upgrades - I have found Armour to be better than Attack, benefitting from Guardian Shield. Effective 5 armour makes them really hard to crack. As for damage - it's nice, but interceptors will kill Marines in one pass regardless, and Vikings in two. 


For PvP and PvZ I haven't found anything useful yet. Too easily countered by Blink Stalkers or Corruptors.

1369237251.0,1eu84g,The Meta-Game of ZvP,IsomerSC,20,2,36,"Hey Everyone
  
I want to talk about ZvP as it is currently my favorite matchup to play and watch as both races. What's so crazy to me about ZvP is how it has been entirely flipped on it's head in HotS. In Wings of Liberty, which was really frustrating.  
  
In ZvP now, more air play, more hydras, ultralisks, more aggression, and more back-and-forth games. I'm going to talk about how the pro ZvP's are playing out right now, focusing on sOs vs. Soulkey Ro4 from the GSL.  
  
From Protoss's perspective, then you'll probably see more forge fast expands, as Zerg is more likely to put on aggression because their third looks less safe. Also, if they do take the third on these maps, getting the fast upgrades from your forge are an important aspect of your 2-base allins.  
  
For gateway expands, throw down 2-3 more gateways, and put on a pressure if you see Zerg has taken his third. Basically, you just go with mothership core, get up a pylon, and warp in zealots while going tech behind it. The goal of these pressures is to eliminate Zerg's third base with just mineral units, since you care more about your gas at this point as you're already probed and now you're just teching up at home. You also see a number of different kinds of pressure with the MSC
  
Forge expands are still fairly popular. There are plenty of 2 base allins you see after forge. There are the old ones, which can both recall if things get hairy or use time-warp to great effect.  
  
Briefly, which is important because it allows Protoss to play styles that were simply unsafe in WOL.  
  
So, Stargate is the best way to play a macro style. It gives you Phoenix for harassment, to force spores and keep Zerg pinned back. At the same time, it allows you to make VR if you scout a roach-allin and it allows you to make a transition faster into Skytoss later.  
  
Skytoss is going to be the answer in about 50% of games, play at different speeds, and in some respect, they could be ""stylized"" to meet your own playstyle.  
  
Different playstyles I've seen: voidray-centric styles with some gateway units underneath, balanced compositions like chargelot-archon with lots of harass/warpin, and so on. I actually believe that Protoss is the race right now which has the most stylistic play at the top levels. MC will bash people down with tricky and aggressive timings, Parting is a sort of macro-pusher and relies on Bomber-esque pushes and his ability to make great tactical decisions and forcefields, etc.  
  
From the Zerg perspective, pool-first to be completely safe from cannons. The thing is hatch-first is stronger than it used to be because more gateway expands are going down, which are very weak at punishing the hatchery-first play.  
  
The thing is this: if Protoss takes gas, you need gas for zergling speed, Lair, roach speed, upgrades, and potentially hydralisks. Hydralisks are way better than they used to be with their speed upgrade and they are powerful answers to all kinds of all-ins from Protoss (particularly force-field centric ones like immortal allin).  
  
If you want to play swarm-hosts, who is likely to expand quickly and sit his army somewhere in the middle if he sees you're going swarmhosts. He knows you're not going to send the swarmhosts past your spines, so he can position his colossus to deny locusts from hitting his 3rd/4th bases without fear. This is fine. He will eventually go air or storm against you, so you want to get some more tech up to supplement your swarmhosts, like infestors or vipers. Air upgrades can also be useful for your corruptors if he starts mixing in VR or tempest.  
  
If you want to play muta-ling, get zergling and mutalisk attack upgrades, and after your initial clutch of mutalisks (7-8), you will be able to take a 4th/5th base. Put these bases as far from each other as possible so there's less of a chance of losing them both. You really will want the extra gas for FAST transitions between mutalisks/swarmhosts/ultralisks. Tech transitions are basically the scariest thing about late-game Zerg. Utilize them against Terran and Zerg as well.  
One thing people transition into from this is muta-corruptor. It relies on heavy air upgrades and sometimes you will want to mix-in infestors if he's going mass phoenix.   
  
Late-game Zerg I think should include swarmhosts or ultralisks. These are better than broodlords or MASS mutalisks, really, because they spawn their locusts from a very large range and allow you to siege-push bases without having to make mass infestors to protect your broodlords. This creates a dynamic where Protoss is now trying to out-multitask you with warp prisms. Then there are beautiful dances between HT and vipers. There are just so many interactions that can happen in late-game because Blizzard has strengthened so many units that people are pretty much using all of them now.  
  
So, with pressures and different opening styles in the early-game, many more different compositions, and a late-game that's much more interesting and variegated than WOL. I think Blizzard really improved the Protoss race with the MSC and Skytoss buffs and it's helped PvZ look so much better. I hope you guys enjoyed my commentary on the matchup, let me know if you want one on another matchup.

1367955477.0,1dvqgy,Terran TvP Tip: The Pros of Dropping and Helpful Tips,bauski,23,2,12,"**PRERAMBLE**

*This isn't necessary to read but it does help give context to what I talk about later*

TvZ has been butt easy these days, or with added marauders to take down the roaches.


Sadly


1. Protoss does not expand faster than you

2. The Protoss defense force is huge. Marines vs Gateway units, but usually they will always have a stronger army set.

3. You have to get Marauders to deal with Robo stuff. So that cuts into my gas and money for my 16 marine push anyway.

4. TvP is very gas heavy

5. The longer you let them make their army

6. Late game Protoss has great AOE damage.


Because of these problems, I knew exactly what kind of army he was getting. I was ready for this shit. I got my medivacs, I got my vikings, I got my upgrades, I got my stim, concussive shell, my combat shields, etc etc. Then we had an engagement. Then we had another. Then another, or archons


So I showed this to my friends before our weekly Round Robin King of the Hill and they asked me why I didn't drop. No


**DROPS AND THEIR PROS**


The first thing we have to understand is the ""WHY"" aspect of drops. If we lose our ""Why"" then we'll start executing our build and battle strategy wrong and that leads to sadness and anger. (both of which are mind killers).

So why do we drop? Think of it like going against Zerg. When you are going against Zerlings and roaches, with a little bit of micro we can get the best engagements and trade efficiently every time. But once the Ultralisks come out, **you stop engaging in the front so much because your necessary APMs go up a huge amount and the trades become inefficient.**

This is the same thing with the Protoss army. Depending on the compositions you can take less micro necessary, the idea behind the Protoss army is the death ball, once the trades stop being efficient, the key is not to attack them directly, but to start hurting them where they can't be.

Because here is the thing: **Just like ultras

So now we have 1 good reason for dropping: ""When army to army engagement factor is too much of a loss for you


Here is another good reason: When a Terran starts putting on pressure early game with drops, in which case feel free to ignore drops and just push into his base and kill him, and blink has not been researched for stalkers. So he either must get blink, put down a bunch of static defense, or keep warping in units to deal with your harassment. All of these things are to your advantage.

Why? Well, and the more you force them to pop out stalkers, the weaker their final death ball is going to be. They also cost a bit of gas and minerals, slowing the Protoss down from upgrading and teching as he would like to. 

If the Protoss decides to put down a lot of static defense, in which case you can still drop in the holes and then destroy his static defense still putting him back, forcing him to make more static defense, or he over makes static defense in the back, at which point you fall back to ""I'm going to run in your front now, and just kill you.""

The third option is a popular method of defense: defending by warping in warp gate units. Its effective in the early mid game as a defense, you can always just take your guys and leave, making him waste more supply on gateway units, slowing down his tech and upgrades.


So now we have our 2nd reason for dropping: ""If I drop a lot on your


And looking at the ""whys"" now we can see the pros of dropping. This way, and you'll be keeping the Protoss on the back foot. Win win!


**TIPS ON DROPS**

So yesterday as I was dropping on my friends, so if you read one and you think ""but"" or have a ""what"" you can always real the previous rules and get a better sense of ""why"".


*1. Know when you drop*

Without scouting this is useless. If you 1rax fast expand like me and then start focusing on getting your drop going, or what he is planning next. If you scan his army, and you have an overwhelming victory, then just push it. Remember that we drop because Protoss usually has a stronger/bigger army, but if that's not the case, there is no reason not to.


*2. Drop early and don't lose it*

If rule #1 has been fulfilled then this is step 2. Surprise him with your first drop, the earlier in the game he has to make gateway units the longer it will take him to start teching. The first drop isn't for damage, it is to set the pace of the game, and to make him over anticipate. Kind of like a jab in boxing. Not a knock out, just a feeler.

As an acilary thing to mention


*3. Drop slow boost out

When I first started dropping I was so anxious to do scary fast attacks with damage that I would boost in and drop in. Sometimes I would be lucky and catch him by surprise, but losing the medivac was horrifying. Now, I slowly move in, slowly drop in, and then load up and boost the shit out of there as soon as I see that first stalker. It might not do as much damage, but it still forces him inside the whole time.

Don't forget that saving medivacs also means sending your red medivacs back to be repaired. Sometimes when I'm playing really well, half way from my place and his, so that I only have to go half way (which is the equivilant of 1 boost) to repair my ships.


*4. Don't commit just cause you're there

Sometimes I just push in cause I get to the outside of his base


*5. Static defense, tech(robo bay, temp archive, twilight, forges, robo, cyber), gateways

From highest to lowest priority of things you will want to destroy. Static defense first, you might be stopping tech, but you'll always be slowing down supply and unit making, which is key if you have to deal with army to army engagements later. Tech is obvious. Stop his cols, stop his high templars, (infact archive might be better than cols cause then he can't feed back your medivacs), stop the blinks, 3/3 rax units will defeat slow ass 3/3 gateway units any day.


*6. More prongs the better*

There are 3 reasons to do multi-prong attacks. The first is that it spreads his units out more, and then move and engage, you just have to drop both and then take care of some business at home before flying your medivacs away.


*7. The heavier the drops

One drop isn't that much. If you're dropping you will always have less units then him at home. So if you want to keep him inside, and then I add a prong, and then I add more medivacs to each side, then I add another prong. If you have 3 prongs of 3 medivacs each, you've probably won the game by then.


*8. At some point he will just say ""fuck it"" and push at you. Drop and lift your shit.*

Base racing sounds kind of scary, it's a breeze as you lift up your stuff and run to other sides of the map, and start a couple of command centers at different places. With medivacs and bio, marine scouts all over the map, you will always find his stuff first, and kill him before he can even destroy one of your bases.



**WARNINGS ABOUT DROPS**

Well now that I've sold you on drops


1. If he's going air first. Don't drop, his gateways will only be finishing up, and with 3 rax of stuff you'll just kill him. If he goes air later to deal with drops, treat it like mutas. Bait his phoenixes out to some land away from his army, drop down your marines and take care of them. I've found that having pockets of marines near your drops can also help in this situation. If he over commits on phoenix, once again,  just in from the front and kill him.

2. If he goes really really quick high templars. Just push at the front and kill him.

3. If he goes really really quick dark templar. Build a turret and a bunker up at each base

4. If he goes quick robo


**Final Thoughts**

Well I hope this helps some of you with your plays, not to mention forcing them into specific build compositions, which is really a great way to take control.

I guess here is a quick TLDR for the really lazy

**TLDR**

1. Scout to know when to drop.
2. If the Toss army is strong
3. More+stronger drops = slower production/tech + smaller army/econ
4. Save drop units
5. If he ignores and pushes out

1348589108.0,10geau,ZvT: Thoughts on the current metagame,IsomerSC,24,7,9,"Entaro Adun, Isomer 729.  
  
**Early Game**  
In the early game, and others have shown, even a 6 pool can be beaten by CC first if you micro it correctly. Furthermore, with the improvements to Queens and overlords, early pressure builds have fallen by the wayside as Terrans are increasingly looking to wins in the mid and late game. The most common transitions from the CC first are bio timings, marine/hellion, or hellion/banshee
  
From the Zerg side, a relatively slow speed, or some kind of 2base pressure build. If the gasless third is taken, Zergs are usually opting to go for 4-6 Queens and static defenses to help defend against early timings.  
  
Often, or the pressure gets held.  
  
**Mid Game**  
If Terran went for a bio timing, Polt, and Taeja have used bio timings). Many Terrans favor adding in hellions with their bio to help against Zerglings as well as securing map control BEFORE that pressure, therefore they have the factory up already and can go right for tanks. So, like bio timings, marine/hellion can easily transition into marine/tank.  
If Terran wants to go for mech in the mid to late games
  
From here
  
For Zerg's midgame, which can be devestating but are ultimately rather all-in-ish because they are really hard to transition out of if you don't do damage (DRG and IdrA love to use this timing).  
  
Despite the slightly resurgent popularity of mutalisks, you will be able to be more aggressive and can do big pressures onto the Terran third and then runby into the main, whereas infestor ling is inherently more passive, as you are teching up a lot faster and are intending to kill with Hive.  
  
If a Zerg sees mech, plus he will probably take some damage back. Of course, if T transitions into more tech lab factories faster, then they can pop out a couple of thors and mutas become pretty useless pretty fast.  
  
Infestors against mech is popular because it transitions better than mutas. You want to get Hive against mech, they can mind control thors, as well as spam infested terrans, which are really great if energy is plentiful and you have some units to buffer damage temporarily. Most commonly, you will see speed roaches paired with the infestors as lings pretty much get roasted instantly.  
  
There are a number of allins Zerg can do against mech, which can really shut down a lot of these roach allins. 
  
**Late Game**  
Moving into max positions, which is okay as long as Terran gets up some marauders or extra thors/tanks and less air units. If Zerg goes BLs, Terran absolutely needs more than 1 starport already built so they can slam out vikings, preferably at least 4 at a time.  
  
The main dynamics in the late game are similar for mech, so if T can keep Zerg to 4 bases they only have to kill the deathball one time and then Zerg will have to choose between remaxing with cheaper midgame units or getting a much slower remax.  
  
Terran-wise, though that's only advisable on maps like Metropolis where attacking gets really impossible in the late game.

---------------------------
**Versus Zerg**

To elaborate on my flexibility problem:  for example, a Gateway first expand, always a similar build though).  From there, I try to go into a 7 gate timing attack, to knock out the zerg's third, and take my own third.  From there the plan is to make double robos, and go into immortal colossus. I know that once I get this going, reason being is once broodlords come into play

However, that I also lose to a decent amount of time), I struggle, I lose focus, and am unsure how to respond.  Do I continue going for the colossus if the zerg decided to go for mutas instead of the roaches?  Or should I go into some sort of templar tech with archons?  What about large amounts of banelings?  I think I've set myself too hard in stone with the build I've practiced.  

Found a replay.  This is, into a 3rd with robos.  But I end up getting crushed by roaches.  [Here](http://www.uksc2.com/uploads/Reddit%20Replay%201.SC2Replay) it is for download.  

--------------------------
**Versus Terran**

I have a similar problem with Terran.  I have problems reading a terrans opening. Ive been taught if a terran takes an early gas (around 13 or so), as I'm playing diamond players, I find that this holds little truth, as they just expand anyways, and by the time my obs get to their base, I'm already behind.  

When I don't expect fast aggression for terran, expand, into 7 gate with HT/Archon/Charge-zealots.  Now sometimes I can catch the terran by surprise with this, and they wont have any ghosts to defend it, but most times, I get scanned around 8:30 - 9:00, and they start into ghosts.  I think this just falls into positioning and spreading units

And lastly, but make for a fast push anyways, around something like 7-8:00, with something like 12 marines and 2-3 marauders.  At this point, I'm still trying to get my tech all up, and my gateways are just finishing.  It's just too much too soon, and I crumble under the pressure.  

-----------------------
**Versus Protoss**

Protoss is my least concerned race, and 90% of the time I do (I'm pretty decent at microing low amounts of troops.  Larger armies, I struggle with micro).  If the 4 gate fails, I back out, expand, and go into a colossus-based macro game play.  If anyone can recommend a strong opening build to use in PvP, that doesn't involve 4 gating, I would love to read up on it

Found a replay of my 4 gate.  Nothing special

-----------------------

I apologize for the really long post, but now that I'm playing diamond players, and other top ranked platinum players, everything is suddenly not working anymore.  'Tis quite frustrating.

1335576408.0,sw7d2,"DUCKVILLE's crazy Nix to Carrier build - A non-serious, fun build to try if you want to spice up PvP",DUCKVILLELOL,25,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/sw7d2/duckvilles_crazy_nix_to_carrier_build_a/

I'm not joking - though I have no illusions that this is some ""METAGAME CHANGING"" build or something, and aware of ""army values"".

Opening up Stargate seems to work nicely on NA (I'm Diamond on there, and get a few kills.

However I decided to (and this originate on KR not NA) go a little further with it, then stop and focus on ""normal"" units like robo tech and so forth. This goes for far more of them at the cost of ground units, which may seem strange however as you'll see in some of my replays here, with a large contingent of nix you can still defend things - providing you have **good scouting and army value awareness.**

After the nix opening, maybe 3 cannons depending on how safe you feel based on the scouting from the Phoenix. A robo can be handy to make sure you have 1 obs to remove enemy obs and lookout for DT's, however I've found that with very careful and studious cannon placements from an early forge; you can negate both of those things - however that's a personal choice, I've been on a cannon binge lately; getting them in large numbers in all matchups for fun.

There is a certain point where you'll probably need to defend the ""big push"" from your opponent who'll be annoyed at the way the play goes down - this is where nix control and keeping them alive the whole game is very important. You'll be down on ground units obviously because you've spent more on the nix, the next push will come when a couple of the carriers are out and you'll be fine then, and then fine after that... and so on. :)

Anyway

Depending on what you see, you'll need to prepare to graviton beam like a boss, put more cannons down, that sort of thing. Safe to say; if you see your opponent getting a third, you get one too. Once 2-3 carriers are out and your opponent hasn't taken one, you can feel safe in moving out to take yours because you should be fine to defend it.

Upgrades are kinda required, just so you can make sure you have air superiority and also nice ups for your carriers once they are on the field.

I've had various responses to seeing some nix -&gt; carriers - ranging from quite odd - people getting templar and archons only (which is cute, almost like an all in - however if you have a couple of cannons you should keep some alive - or get 3/3/3 and blink on stalkers ASAP. I'm not talking ""cool bro I have 3/3/3 at the 34 minute mark"" I mean super fast. Triple robo if you have to. Because the only thing that has really beaten me down with this is that one play, because obviously stalkers are nice and mobile, and with huge ups they will smash carriers even when carriers get close to the tipping point.

Another big weakness as noted in the seperate thread is that a blink stalker timing early on can really wreck your shit if it's done right. I personally don't feel that phoenix openings are ""way more vulnerable"" than any other style - it's a matter of how your opponent utilises their stalkers and their blink. But, given that you can have trouble getting a decent ground army up because you're focusing on nix, but still. 

Extra side-notes to think about which you may want to think about for me because I'm lazy:

* Getting the nix onion-crystal upgrade can (no joke) be worth it sometimes. I've gotten it on a couple of occasions - it can really help if your opponent is being stubborn and still continues to get colossi with blink stalkers - keeping the nix out of range of the stalkers as much as possible is a huge thing. But again - the trouble I've been having with the build is dealing with blink stalkers

* I have no idea what is the most cost efficient and useful for the air upgrades - I would assume that given the interceptors shoot twice you'd want to get weapons as a priority over armour - however if you're facing off against mass stalkers (which as pointed out many times is the **most common** defense) - you may want armour

* Chargelots are something that work quite nicely with the carriers as both a meatshield and also as damage dealers against stalkers. If you position them right they can be quite useful in blocking out the stalkers - or if you hold them under the carriers when stalkers blink under them to attack you'll shread them easily.

* Having a mothership can be very very nice of course, you can lose a battle from your *own* vortex. I'm not saying don't do it - just make sure you think very hard before you place a vortex down if you get to that stage. Mass recall however would be my use of choice for a mothership if you get to it, rush up to an opponent's expo, kill it, recall back. Similar to very very late stage PvT in Brood War. 

**Again with my little disclaimer: I'm in no way a pro at playing Protoss, and if a scrub like me can do ok with it at a diamond level perhaps some of you masters guys might be able to work with it. Also worth noting that I don't have a particular build down - I play to what I see and also whether I'm drunk or not.**

Remember this last little piece of advice: This is a **fun** build, you're in a good spot. Measure your opponent's army and calculate the cannons you need to defend if he pushes, and remember to LIFT ALL THE THINGS! if he attacks.

1333705447.0,rw2yx,"Discussion on a ""standard"" way to play Protoss vs Zerg.",Nadril,21,3,10,"So I've read through the [**PvZ Beating Stephano Style**](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=320894) thread on Team Liquid and I thought that we could use our own here on reddit to try and ""think tank"" some ideas.

Essentially what I hope is that between Team Liquid and us we can try and figure out a safe

* We don't rely on gimmicks. If your build requires you to snipe tech with dropped immortals

* Doesn't rely on all-in's or massive damage in order to stay in the game.

So I think something that is maybe important (that I didn't see people discussing on Team Liquid) is to try and talk about the differences between **PvZ** and **TvZ**. I think it is fairly agreed that TvZ is probably the most balanced (non mirror

When I look at how players play TvZ they often use several very well timed attacks or pressure moves. Usually it starts off with the reactor hellions in order to gain map control and disallow the zerg from a super quick 3rd. Than they'll often times go into some sort of siege tank / marine timing before or as mutalisks are hitting.

Right now with PvZ our problem is that when we FFE we are essentially sitting ducks until like 8 minutes at the earliest. There is *nothing* that the zerg is afraid of before then. I think we lack the specialized timed attacks to force units and delay the zerg that terran have been doing.

There are a lot of people on the team liquid thread suggesting stuff such as gateway expands or the [**YufFE Gate Nexus**](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/index.php?title=Gate%20Nexus%20YufFE&amp;stable=0&amp;shownotice=1&amp;fromsection=Con%20features#Overview) build. Some have pointed to how [**LiquidNony plays the match up as well. (2nd game)**](http://www.twitch.tv/liquidtyler/b/311392240)

So lets discuss

Also this isn't necessarily just about stopping Stephano's style, but it shouldn't leave you super open to certain attacks or builds. (For example some people are suggesting stuff on the Team Liquid thread that would just get crushed by early 3 base mutalisks, or any attack before 12 minutes from the zerg).

Considering how much this subreddit has grown recently

1) My first question is in regards to rally points, tanks, thors,
battle cruisers, unless said unit dies. If that is the case they will than revert back to the original rally point just outside my main, instead or remaining next to their structures or rallied to their death somewhere on the map where I have potentially just lost an engagement.     

That being said, rather than trying to use a universal rally system that tends to work in most situations, without the need to alter it often (except in the case of new structures being added to your control group.

So reddit, and how would you recommend I change my rally style?




2) Viking production most commonly starts for terran players when colossus, TvZ, and TvT respectively. When watching pro matches, I've often seen terran players start, and continue to invest in air weapons upgrades despite their air force not necessarily being more than a small minority within their force. 

My question is




3) Ravens. Pros rarely invest in them from what I can tell (with exceptions) despite their having what I see to be a plethora of excellent uses in many matchups. Examples include:

--Early-ish raven in TvZ to more efficiently slow creep spread

--Pdd against Protoss. From what I hear 2-3 ravens with a Pdd each can make a major difference against just about any army composition

-- Raven/s + Vikings in TvT between siege lines lets you counter enemy vikings with Pdd even if you have inferior viking count, underutilized) method of throwing down autoturrets next to front-running enemy sieged tanks to either absorb the initial tank shots as the rest of your army charges, or cause enemy tanks to inflict splash damage on each other

--Mobile Detection (DUH, Surely a raven with your army is more efficient than scanning whenever you need to see burrowed/cloaked units around your force

--Seeker missile. I'll include this here despite recognizing that Pdd is typically the more efficient use of 125 energy. Clumped marines get smashed by it. Using TvT as an example, there is no warning (given in the form of an alert by the game) until the sucker lands, so wouldn't it be efficient to use one in that manner against clumped marines behind/around siege lines, assuming you have air control?

So, in almost every game. Is this something that actually IS used more often than I am led to believe, and I am merely naive? And are there other use for them I have missed? (excluding the outrageously fun but volatile mass raven strategy many a monobattle comes down to)



#4 MMM v Protoss. This may seem obvious, this changes depending on your build/ the opponents build, and how long the game was been going on for, but I feel like there is such a thing as too many marauders when compared to your marine count. 

Simple question: What is a good marauder:Marine Ratio in the highest efficiency MMM composition army I could get in TvP



Anyway, perhaps some good discussion will come of this, as respectable debate and organized information exchange is something I don't think we see enough of on starcraft subreddits :)

Thanks ahead of time for the help

TLDR #1: What rally style do you use

TLDR #2: When should I get Terran Air weapon upgrades for vikings specifically

TLDR #3 Why do high level players invest in ravens so little

TLDR #4 What is the ideal Marine:Marauder ratio in an MMM army against protoss

Recently, it made me think about Starcraft. I realized that this phrase gets at many bad mistakes made by amateurs and professionals alike: we make decisions without scouting properly and then we find ourselves in sticky situations because of it.  More simply, it made me think about the importance of playing reactively, not robotically. 
  
When I think of ""reactive"" play
  
For lower league players (below plat)
  
Let us take an extreme example as our first
  
However
  
""That's such a noob build"" you might say. However, if we come to understand the *precise* reasoning behind everything we do in the game, we would probably become GM level because we are making super baller decisions all the time 
  
Let me give you a precise example from my own play. In the Zerg vs Zerg early game, you get only one gas geyser and you use the gas reactively. Constantly, you are looking at the mini map where your overlord is in front of his base. If you see a big wave of speedlings coming in, then you convert all of your lings to banes and delay your Lair and tech (upgrades, roaches). If you do not see these incoming units, you can slowly tech up on that one gas geyser, whilst droning up and not making lings or banes.  
  
Truly, subtle variations in the information provided by scouting lead to subtle variations in the decision making of professionals.  
  
Thus, gas timings, expansion timings, unit positioning, unit composition, transitions, etc. Look at each decision you make and ask yourself: Is this the best thing to do right now based upon what I have scouted?  
  
Dovetailing from that, build orders, and what to look for when you scout.

However normally the time that this occurs the economy is weaker than later in the game when the player has significantly more probes. Meaning lost mining time is relatively lower to total mineral income. Normally I find the time to transfer is just when you want to be building a large round of production structures and those 5-7 probes in transfer delays doing this.

I'm just a gold leaguer I am sure there is good reason behind this but I hate not understanding all the games nuances.

*About Strategy*

So recently my opponents have gotten smarter and better at their game, for instance if a weird timing happens or some harassment comes, I can always flow back to my build, but my feeling of ""being lost"" has started to come up mostly, around the late mid game.

So as I was at work thinking today, then switched to bio, then switched to mech, then bio again then air. You would lose. It doesn't make sense. Your drunk, go home. And if that last thing sounded funny to you, that actually happened to me, cause I panicked.

*A strategy is based off of preference and advantages and determines the rules of engagement and production.* That sentence explains why a strategy is important, and decided my own rules of engagements, and floundered and died. Like a chicken with its head cut off. Today I have decided to remedy this issue.


---

 
*Coming up with Rules*


Based off my previously write ups

What are the advantages to bio ball: Highly mobile. High DPS. Quick production.
What are some disadvantages: Needs a lot of APM. Highly squishy. Horrible for late game army vs army scenario


Previously, I tried to mix in tanks or widow mines, or whatever else to try and secure my base. But if a big late game army pushes at my front, I lack any way to win that fight. Unless I can flank them from the back and destroy them. So instead of trying to make my build more mediocre, trying to account for all scenarios, I should just push my advantage forward.

So since I cannot win against a big army push, being scared.** This also goes along with the ""highly"" mobile advantage of my armies.

Going by that 1st rule that I Have just instated, which I'm fine with. I always have some extra gas geyers that are unchecked.

Also going by that 1st rule

One of my advantages to this army is how quickly I can make things. Medivacs, and gas and continuously produce more stuff. **Rule 3: Maximize on production and production buildings instead of later game units.**


A 2nd preference that I have is in my comfort in defending in the beginning before moving into my early mid game drop/push mode.

The second part of that preference is already inline with our first rule

First, we'll just follow the build as it is right now, and open safe while expanding early. Data wise, my games rarely end early anyway. And if I do 
lose

The third part, and how will I win?""

Knowing that bio-ball, and all the production facilities I made from Rule 3 are now null, and rule 1 doesn't even apply. We can either change the rules to open up to a more flexible build, which in effect will dull the blade, or we can just through mech out. I will through mech out, but that's just my choice.

A second choice is air, and vipers. So no no no.

That means that I will be sticking to bio all the way through the game. Which means

From what I'm gathering here it means I will have to maximize the mid game as long as I can to maximize my advantage of harassment, and then finally look for a key engagement to hit his army hard. I think there is a rule here somewhere... **Rule 4: Maximize mid game to weaken key late game engagements**

This rule automatically brings up another rule then. If we want to have the late game advantage earlier

And since we don't really have any other plan than to get to mid game


 ---


*The Rules*


So as a little break from all of this chatter

Rule 6. Stay alive early on

Rule 5. Favor upgrades for slightly later mid game harassment

Rule 1. I should be out there doing things instead of at home

Rule 2. Expand a lot

Rule 3. Maximize on production and production buildings instead of later game units

Rule 4. Maximize mid game to weaken key late game engagements


Simplified here we go again:

1. Live to mid game
2. Favor upgrades for delayed harassment
3. Drop/Push 100%
4. Expand with CCs and Production Buildings


The last rule comes automatically from what I do in rule 4.


For today, and stupid, but I like simple. I like the idea of a strategy that relies on advancement of skills in macro and engagements. If anything this will give me great practice in dropping and pushing, and continuously making stuff, which is my weakest point.

Hope you guys got something out of this as well.

Seems to me that early game, as they have to replace the probe (50 mins) and as long as their base is undersaturated, they're losing income from that probe. 

Mules should really only be targeted when the terran's base is completely saturated

**Instructors and Coaching recruitment** 

I am currently looking for more active coaches and instructors who are interested in helping out in workshop // group coaching sessions every Wednesday around 5:00pm PT.  (roughly 1.5 - 2 hours).  Each session will have a theme (ranging from generic Terran strats to specific MVP Mech Build)

Coaches can also look for students to coach one on one.

We're still in a pinch to get some coaches for tomorrow's session!


**Students**

We're also looking for some active participants who are looking to improve in the game and want to attend our weekly group coaching sessions!  Players can be students one week

**Sounds awesome

I just ask that you guys sign up on the website so we can reach out to you for interviews


**What's the point of this study?**

I'm currently a graduate student at UC Irvine, and peer support.  Obviously, StarCraft 2 encompasses so many of these principles. 

There are other researchers looking at other communities that span diverse demographics - such as active online fashion communities, and even fantasy wrestling.  


**Where do I sign up?**

We have a website set up at http://www.teachmestuff.net that will act as the hub for us to organize events, or email me at tcyoung [at] uci [dot] edu.  You can sign up for a user account as well. 

Everyone is encouraged to keep participating with the subreddit's coaching nights

There is an event tomorrow so please RSVP on the website so we have a headcount.

I have a 1:1 win to loss ratio right now (sometimes it tips towards the loss side, Banelings, fucking Mutas and cloaked Banshee harass...

Since I started playing Starcraft I have had a problem where in long games my arms will lock up. I've played on and off and generally would limit my playing amount until recently. I've started to really strive toward becoming a far better player. In fact I have put aside a large amount of time towards just practicing. I began running into a problem where my arms will lock up in a game (generally mid-late game) and essentially become unable to play at all

Has anyone had this issue and found the problem along with how to fix it. I really want to become a high end player but I feel like this is such a large handicap. I wonder if it has to do with posture, etc. Anyways I've searched both google and reddit and have yet to find any help. Also, this has never happened to me in any other game I've played, curious if it has to do with the high amount of speed that the game is played at.

Edit: I'm getting some good responses. I'll try to do some more physical exercise (already do stretches) before playing and eat more fruits. I do drink enough (tons of water) so that shouldn't be big deal. In addition I'm starting to work on posture and I think that with better diet (need to add fruits mainly) I may be fine.

What do I do to really put an effort into becoming a better player

**This bit is not important but it can help explain where I'm coming from...**

As a guitar player who thought myself, looked up a couple easy songs, learnt to play them, and just played. It was fun. Relaxing. But as time went by, I started feeling the need to really get better, to be able to play all those tough songs. Suddenly, the need to get better was bigger than the need to play for fun.

So I went through online lessons and went through hours of learning scales, finger precision exercises, etc, doing the same thing over and over. And at the end of each *practice session* I would play for fun, then. I wouldn't play for fun all the time. Most of the time was dedicated to just getting better and better. Playing for fun came afterwards.

Sometimes I would learn a song which needed me to learn a new technique and I would keep playing that song over and over until I nailed it. (I'm assuming this is the same as playing ladder games with a goal in mind

I'm feeling that there is a way to do this in SC2... but please

For those of you with some BW experience you will remember the nightmare that is the manner pylon. In broodwar it was a reasonably common practice to send your scouting probe into their mineral line and build a pylon next to the minerals to catch probes behind it so they can't mine and it also blocks the patches, but I think if you trapped 1 probe it was worth it (correct me if I am wrong) and if you got two or three you were doing incredibly well trading 100 minerals for much more than that, along with throwing off the opponents timings.

I thought it was dead due to smarter AI in sc2

It is not common place in sc2, but you move it closer to the nexus, so the probes can still mine. You can also try and be quick enough to run in the way of the enemy probe, but that can miss and you need pylons anyway.

1350012753.0,11ck96,Mechanics Matter: Getting back to basics and mastering your control of the game.,IsomerSC,21,4,15,"Greetings Executors
  
I recently wrote an article about the importance of macro and in the past I have written an article about staying healthy when you play games for long stretches of time. See my posts for those and more: http://www.reddit.com/user/IsomerSC/submitted/  
  
In this post, select workers, build things, and so on. However, once those ""n00b"" mechanics are mastered, there exist numerous others which are ESSENTIAL obstacles to overcome if you ever want to reach the upper levels of play.  
  
Here is my hierarchy (prioritized from easiest to hardest) of mechanics you should learn.  
  
1. All basic commands (right/left click
2. Memorize all tech trees and hotkeys
3. Find comfortable settings (mouse sens
4. Mastery of at least 3 (try for 5) control groups (Ctrl+1 for units
5. Use of minimap (both for intel/defending harass and for sending units/rallying them)    
6. Multitask  
7. Mouse precision  
8. Engagement/micro  
9. Utilizing spam/drills to increase your APM  
10. Controlling emotions
  
I hope some of these concepts will give you an idea of what you need to work on.

DocGator (me) vs an annoying man

I'm high bronze (top 8) and have only been playing for a few weeks, and lost twice to the exact same strategy.

He starts off by building assimilators on my two gasses and both my natural gasses - at this point I realised I was playing the same guy I played before and didn't scout as I was recognising the exact same play. I built an assimilator on his gas to slow him down and pumped out zealots in case of an attack.

I think this is my first mistake - he spent minerals on 4 assimilators before he built his own

When I finally get a core and gas I start pumping out stalkers (and knew he was going voidrays again as he used one to destroy the assimilator I built in his base) and try to get to max cap faster than him

I think my macro was better than his

I wasn't sure how to push his base properly as he had blocked in

I've run into this on the ladder a few times, but gets a half dozen ravens with Thors. The thing is, Seeker Missiles *cannot* be magic boxed, I try it multiple times in that replay and the splash is just too big. Corruptors are the obvious response, but with the ravens hovering over the Thors, anytime you ever try to attack the Ravens, your corruptors take a ton on Thor shots (crippling if you don't magic box, you aren't going to get many raven kills).

What beats a Thor + Raven comp? Imagine I have 4 billion gas and minerals: what army can I build to kill that? Ultras get destroyed by Thors

As background: the way I play mech is heavy roaches and deny expansions as often as possible while macro-ing like a boss. In a perfect game, and do it again. I exploit the fact that I can be mobile and trade very badly as I'm way ahead of T in economy. Once I don't see that working, I switch over to brood + infestor.

It *feels* like this is an example of a strategy where you just can't let them do it. If you let them get going and build that army, he can split the map in half (as the replay shows) and base trading isn't really an option.

(I'm not talking about the 2 base roach baneling timing that he does

**edit** I fiddled in bnet and came up with a first stage build order

* 15h/16p/17g
* 1x queen
* @116 gas start taking drones off (0 drones on gas when you have 128 gas)
* 22 overlord
* 5 roaches when warren finishes

I don't include lings or scouting points intentionally.

Transitions?
From what I've tried, and get a third when you can afford it (if you spread creep with first queen instead of larva inject, you can afford a hatch earlier). The second is that the 22 overlord may not be optimal, maybe instead of that, 2x extractor trick to free up supply for the fifth roach, and while you're supply blocked take a third, then get the second queen after the overlord pops. I'm pretty sure this is the greediest option. The third option is that I've seen violet not care about a third base at all,,True,t3_sn86w
1334925544.0,sjjq0,My ZvT (EU Diamond),achristes,15,1,26,"Hi

This may be a post you may think is braggy, banshees and most other cheeses, but you HAVE TO scout, if you don't see it coming you will die.

Text in *italics* are notes on what to do if X happens.

**Idea/plan**

The plan is to go for heavily upgraded ling/infestor with a pretty fast hive and transition into maxed crackling/infestor/ultralisk. If he goes mech there is a little guide to that as well but not that thorough.

**Opening**

The opening is a standard 15hatch/16pool and a pretty late gas at 25 supply. The gas is fast enough to get speed before m/h allin so I don't care that much.

*NOTE

With the 15h/16p you can start two queens and two sets of lings if you execute it correctly, inject with the first two queens.

When you get your first 100 gas you start ling speed

The two extra queens I mentioned are used to either spread creep or save energy for transfuse in case of banshees or other allins. Lings are for scouting.

**What do you scout?**

If you scout 1 gas going up with your drone scout it 90% of the time means reactor helion expand. It can also be m/h allin

*If you see no helions or very few at around 6 minute mark be prepared for banshees and build an evo chamber

*If you see a bunch of marauders moving out from his base make a shitton of lings

If you see no gas and constant SCV production with your drone it means a 1rax expand and no 2rax

*If he builds a bunker in your nat and you know he's going 1rax expand pull ~4drones and kill the SCV and the potential marine

*If you know he's 2raxing you must patrol a drone at the bottom of your ramp so he can't wall you in with bunkers, but practice is the only way if you want to hatch first.*

**What to do after lair?**

When you lair finishes you plant your infestation pit and a macro hatch (by this time you should be floating ~600minerals)

When your lair finishes you must make an overseer to see if he's going mech or bio (or sky-terran

Take a third at around 9:30

**Bio

Just continue making lings and you should get around 8 infestors before starting you hive, pull around  from each base if you evenly saturated on your first 3 bases (optimal saturation is 16 drones(two full rows) on minerals and 3 drones per gas). 

What you want to do lategame
You can also use infested terrans to tank for siege tank blasts and add DPS to your army

**Mech**

This is very tricky to write a guide for as I don't play vs mech that often

The most basic advice I can give vs mech is to expand and build spines there (and spores if he adds banshees)

If you play vs mech get roach speed and burrow movement

Infested terrans are godlike vs a mech army

Keep him off a third/fourth base as long as you can

**The 15hatch/16pool**

* 9/10 Overlord

* 15/18 Hatchery

* 16/18 Spawning Pool

* 17/18 Overlord

Queens and 2 sets of lings when pool is done.

**Replays**

* Demonstration of opening

* ZvT on Tal'Darim http://drop.sc/164037

* ZvT on Daybreak http://drop.sc/164038 (this is a good expamle on why not to go ultras vs many tanks)

I am a Gold league Terran player. Since I'm not that good

Now, I play a small tournament with some friends of mine, and then I feel really held back by my lack of flexibility. When I would play against my Protoss friend, I would 3rax once, but go 1rax expand all the other games. I managed to beat him in the first round with this. In the second round however, he varied his play to include DT's, 4gate or Void Rays, expand behind the pressure and beat me easily.

Therefore

Starting small

1. A solid macro-oriented build (per matchup). This will be the 'neutral' build

   &gt; vsT: I have a Reaper expand bio build

   &gt; vsP: I have a 1rax Marauder expand

   &gt; vsZ: I have a rax-fac expand into Mech play

2. A cheesy/techy play to force an early advantage / win

1341975088.0,wd4xx,[ZvP][Masters] Proxy hatching an FFE Protoss,,23,8,41,"So I've stumbled into a style that's became my standard ZvP.

**The problem

It feels like cheese. It *feels* dirty as hell. It's like playing ZvZ with a 6 pool, ""what am I doing? how am I getting any better?"" 

I'm looking for opinions... what am I opening myself up to with? What's the ""hard counter""? If I get the proxy hatch down, stargate is stopped with mass queens (they're on 1 base, 1 base stargate is 'LOL'). I feel like not enough Protoss have seen something like this, so I'm just winning because they're a deer in headlights.

**The goal of this style:**

Hatch block to delay the protoss's natural and force a 2nd cannon. If they under-respond

You'll be on 2 base if the Protoss adequately deals with it. You can play 2 base into roaches, he'll need a robo for an obs which muta play is strong against. And a lot of Protoss respond with gateway timings that'll kill your third, but can't break spines and lings at your natural. Plus, it's very unlikely for Protoss to have a 3rd for awhile.

So the big picture point of this whole thing is to take back tempo and throw a wrench into Protoss. You *can* win with a creep block

**The problem with other styles:**

I hate opening 3 hatch. You leave yourself wide open to a ton of stupid shit from Protoss: from 7gate allins, letting P dictate how the game will be played. I'm also not a big fan of roaches in general against P, preferring lings and either mutas or infestors.

**Build Order:**

* Scout on 13
* Drone up to 15
* Drone to 16 then pool
* Your pool and hatch finish around the same time. Cancel the hatch if the have 2 cannons done or almost done. If only 1, still figuring out the timing). Your first overlord helps for figuring this out.
* Macro behind this hard.
* Queen out, then pull off gas. 3 spines in your main to transfer to your natural to anticipate the 4 gate allin.

**Replays:**

* http://drop.sc/218472 - This is almost a perfect game, as he's too far behind to win.
* http://drop.sc/218481 - P defends the proxy appropriately, this P is just bad at defending muta harass.
* http://drop.sc/218485 - Worst case scenario. I've since learned to cancel the hatch if this is going to happen
* http://drop.sc/218677 - See Edit.

I have dozens of these, not anticipating the 4gate quickly enough, not scouting), and not something wrong with the style. There isn't anything I've seen a Protoss do that just goes: ""well, I'm fucked now"" in response to this. 

Any thoughts? This just feels too powerful with absolutely no downside.

Oh yeah

----------

EDIT: Ok, and misread the scout (saw a lot of gateways, assumed big gateway push, first time I see the stargate is when 4 phoenix are killing my overlord) and lost all of my queens in the process and P takes a fast 3rd. Replay here: http://drop.sc/218677.

Here's the important thing: http://imgur.com/2fY6Y.jpg. This is just as his natural finishes, and I have 3 spines down. For everyone saying I'm behind, this picture shows otherwise. 

I go on to win, I no longer feel like I'm playing from behind -- and it turns into a normal game.

Edit again: Well, hard counter doesn't mean micro a probe to stop the hatch at your natural... that's just metagaming.",,False,,t5_2smn2,1342120021.0,,
1341800906.0,w906b,"[ZvP]Why throwing down two pylons at a Zerg's natural and third is a bad, bad thing",Radioactiveman271,26,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/w906b/zvpwhy_throwing_down_two_pylons_at_a_zergs/, the protoss tries as hard as possible to delay or outright deny both of the zerg's expansions. However

When I play ZvP, and then a third hatch at 4:10. However, as is often the case with protoss, they prevent this ideal situation from happening. 
One of the key aspects of ZvP is not overreacting and producing army units before you need to. So, and try to build my first hatchery where i would normally take my third. If he places another pylon there, I smile to myself, because the entire time his worker is harassing me, I have three larva saved up, and a pool that is 90% complete. 

If he decides to not cancel either pylon, and the rest directly to his base. In most scenarios, the lings will arrive at his base before he is ready to deal with them. If you have enough time, focus down the cannon, and then the pylons. Continue streaming in lings, and its almost certainly gg. If you don't have enough time to kill his cannon, simply run up his ramp and start harassing his worker line. You will be able to keep him from mining for a while

[Here is a replay showing the type of game I am talking about.](http://drop.sc/217310) In it, I did not perform as well as i should have, my macro started to slip, and i lost a few unnecessary lings to a surround, but in the end I won anyways.  
**Tl;dr:**Putting down two pylons is very bad



Edit- As people have been pointing out, then I just immediately high tail it back to base and kill the pylons. I then stay active with the zerglings, putting them at all xel'naga towers, taking down destructible rocks, spreading them out across the protoss base, etc.",,,,

1338873317.0,ulmke,"PvZ, Silver, Antiga Shipyard - Help me ""open"" against 10pool ",someenigma,15,6

Playing on Antiga, realise it's a 10pool and immediately decide to abandon my attempt at expanding. I throw up a cannon right near my nexus, and drop a gateway.

He drops his natural hatch at 4:40-ish, really.

Things I know I did wrong 
- Assimilator on gas that's furthest from the cannon. Should've put that down up top.
Possibly/probably didn't need the second pylon up near the ramp

- Macro. I had a gateway (far left one) idle long enough to build a zealot (with supply/minerals in bank). So that aspect of macro (using buildings that I have) definitely needs work. This is just one example. Feel free to say ""build more gateways"" or ""tech more"" (or less?)

- An overlord gets placed outside my base at ~10:30. As soon as I kill it (as I'm leaving to push), or it would've meant he wouldn't see my attack coming until it's too late. Those 14 roaches stopped me taking out his third I would say. Well, that, and me leaving part of my army at home.

Questions I have:
- Did I get my gateways up in time? I feel like I was floating minerals, they could easily have been planted a whole minute earlier, giving me another 4 zealots. It seems like I've answered this myself, but I'm not positive on my ramblings.

- Should I have attempted to hold the low ground somehow (planting a cannon down there)? 

- Is there a ""good"" response against scouting a 10pool? Is 1base play a good response

1338849589.0,ul0fm,Zerg Attempting DIA - Wanting Diamond General Knowledge and possible replay analysis.,nexlux,17,3,12,"Hello

My understanding of build orders, unit composition, timings, Scouting, etc is pretty spot on. I read as much as I could about Zerg online through TL, starcraft_strategy and starcraft regular reddit in the last 2 months.

I am currently at work

I started this season at Silver

Gold consisted of a lot of really clean and consistent 4 gates - I learned to Stephano 3 base and moved past gold.

Platinum so far has been a mix bag

1. Zerg who can hold off my usual rushes ( 6 pool, Baneling busts, spine crawler rushes). After holding off they go for long games and win (I have no problem macro vs macro games, I just can't rush vs macro like I used to)

2. Terran who 2 base and expand mid game after doing seriously punishing Medvac drops. (First few drops are held off

3. Protoss - Any alternative plays than FFE ( 1 base tech(all in's mostly)) (2-3 base 8 gate) (Zealot play these days punishes me hard) FFE is easy, void and deathball against my mass infestor/roach..... )

In summary, I face literally every kind of build imaginable against every race. It's not that it's not fun (I love the variety and challenge Plat brings me!!) and it's not that it's too hard........ I just can't cheese any more. So the real question is, can I still consistently rank up through smart cheese? (read - smart)

I am really looking to move onto dia and masters in this next season. I am looking for insider information/shared experiences on breaking the platinum barrier (Specifically as zerg

(I am mostly looking for people who have gone from platinum to diamond - Specifically these ladders because the metagame in each ladder seems to vary specifically and consistently based on the exact ladder ( just my personal experience)).

I will upload specific replays for each of the listed scenarios

If I just kept playing sheer amounts of games

I know it's a lot to read but I can feel my head hit the ceiling everytime I fail a cheese.

My ZvT is almost exclusively ling/bling/ultra. I throw in a few infestors regularly

You always must have small to medium sized strike forces all over the map. That means 1-2 ultras

Why does this work? Ultras do get destroyed hard by most standard terran compositions after all. But for bio to fight ultras effectively, they must be in well set up immobile formations and good position.

No terran can kite/micro 3 battles at once

You don't need to micro much yourself. You just need to attack multiple places at once

On most maps nydus and drop play are essential for that. I prefer nydus, but well turtling and aware terrans can prevent them quite often if you try to sneak.

In that case I do the multldrops. 3 overlords per drop, and can't effectively be dealt with with any similar sized terran force.

Even if you lose one or two of those task forces in bad trades

Now, but the fact that you have your units spread out all over the map means you can almost always set up good flanks and surrounds on the way.

True timing attacks are created, what I mean by this is sure go 3 gate robo and hit with a 2 collosus timing attack or make marauder and hellions and hit a timing when the zerg doesn't have mutas, cool.

Now a real scary timing attack is unlocked

http://www.own3d.tv/video/329806/NSH_Sage__id_168492__Archive__2011-12-10_12_09_13_-_13_01_43_

Now I'll break the game down, mid game composition of gateway and double robo immortals and eventual collosus.

**Actual Game** -
Literal first thing most people would think is that double robo immortal sounds stupid, 8 dt drop. Well if we see a failed 6 pool into 3 bases yeah he might have lair tech but he'll have no means of scouting the tech with an overseer, cool nearly garunteed to work. Now the dt drop is what made this so interesting to me.

The dt drop does the following damage, Spawning Pool and some drones and lings etc. The important part here is the tech destroyed. Killing those tech structure unlocks a whole new style of play for the protoss, you see that the remaining tech structure for the zerg is the roach warren, right this means for atleast the next minute the zerg is only able to make roaches and drones, why 60 seconds? Well c'mon bro he has no spawning pool or hydra den, spawning pool takes 60 seconds EZ, next the zerg won't have Hydras for a loooooong time, he needs to rebuilds Lair

Ok so sage instantly after doing this says, lo and behold the roaches arrive. I see this as a ""timing attack"" he just abuses that timing to know that his composition is going to beat his opponents so hard that it's perfectly safe to take a 3rd base even at the risk of an all in. Now even though a robo bay was planted right after the robos Sage knowing he has that 2 minute timing for hydras knows that he can delay his collosus, instead he cranks out some more immortals that come out quicker and are immediatley helpful against the roach composition, then he just rolls the other guy cause he's a genius unfortunatley carrying the artosis curse. 

**Application** - Now all of this is pretty common sense but people needa realise they can put actual numbers on their timing attack if they've made one

So how does this help? Well, maybe you wanna do a stim push but hate collosus make a dropship see if you can kill the robo bay, yes? Push! no? Well don't push bro. etc. Maybe you just happen to do a drop and kill a greater spire in the making, brolords aint coming for another blah, vikings take blah to make cool.

I've started playing Terran, but lost a lot more. It was only after doing some searching on the Team Liquid forums I found out that, despite not being listed in TL's 'outdated build' section, it is in fact outdated. I guess stim takes a lot longer than it used to.

I've since converted to harder to learn Macro builds. I'm making some progress every game though. I just wanted to post the builds here and make sure they don't suck before I commit to learning them.



[TvZ - Reactor Hellion Expand](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Reactor_Hellion_Expand_(vs._Zerg)
I haven't faced any Zerg in the ~10 games I've played

* 10 Supply
* 12 Rax
* 13 Refinery
* 15 Orbital Command
* 16 Marine (just one)
* 19 Factory
* 20 Command Center
* 21 Supply Depot
* 22 Start Hellions
* 32 Second refinery
* 33 Orbital command
* 34+ Transition into Siege Tech

I know I left some parts out towards the end of the build order, to roll out with 4 hellions and poke around, while making the second CC into an orbital. My question here is when does one expand? When the OC finishes? Or even later, when Siege Tech finishes? Or should I actually be building my second CC at the natural? Any advice here would be appreciated.



[TvT - Siege Expand](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Siege_Expand)

* 10 Supply
* 12 Rax
* 13 Refinery
* 15 Orbital
* 16 Supply
* 18 Factory
* 20 Refinery(2)
* 23 Supply
* 24 T-lab on Factory
* 25 Siege Tank
* 28 Supply
* 29 Marines **I don't know why the BO lists these here. Is it implied this is when the Reactor will finish?**
* 31 Siege Tech

I know this build isn't the fastest expand, and build the Command Center in the natural? This should end up being somewhere around 6:30.

Unfortunately I got banshee rushed almost every time I used this build. Which is another problem altogether. But in theory I'd like to transition into pure mech after I get 2 bases going.



[TvP - Select's 2-rax FE](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/SeleCT_2_Rax_FE_(vs._Protoss)

* 10 Supply
* 12 Rax(1)
* 13 Refinery
* 15 OC
* 16 Rax(2) into Reactor
* 17 Supply
* 18 Reaper
* 19 Conc Shells
* 22 Marauder
* 24 Supply

After this it gets complicated and I get lost. It says at 27 supply to resume Marine and Marauder production. So I assume making reapers from 22 to 27 supply should leave me with enough minerals to build a Command Center. Then get Stim

What confuses me here is the build says to start my Reactor at 16 Supply, but again I tend to screw builds up before I even get this far. And lastly, once I get my expansion up, I'll be running 2 barracks and a starport. Whats the rule of thumb on how many barracks to use off of two bases?

The build:
-11 pool
-10 extractor (put 3 on gas ASAP)
-9 drone
-10 overlord
(depending on how fast your timings were and if you did the close patch mineral trick you can sneak a drone in here
-12
-@ 50 gas put down Banenest *DO NOT GET METABOLIC BOOST*
On multiplayer maps i send out a drone scout when my pool goes down so you can rally lings right to opponents base.
-15 drone
-16 drone
-when lings reach opponent, cut the 16 drone if you need to)

If he went 14 pool your banes will be morphed as his lings are just hatching

-train 2 more sets of lings and rally to opponents base

Strategy from here:
-If he went for  FE

-If he went pool first he will 4 to 6 lings but he wont be able to kill your banes unless you attack move into the lings and lose them for nothing.
What you want to do (or I do at least):
While my banes are morphing i split them into 3 control groups
the ones going behind the mineral line prevent them from sneaking away that way.

*YOU ONLY WANT TO DETONATE USING X*

This will make sure you get the most out of your banes and they dont blow up on buildings

you should be bringing his drone count under 5 with the first 6 banes.

The second set of lings you trained should be at the base soon

If you have reduced the opponents drones to under 7 I would continue pressure as youll have double the drone count and can out macro (lol at out macro with 14 drones) and wear him down.  If for whatever reason you messed up your banes or he had unreal control then i would pull off gas

I have only lost 1 game out of 15 using this strat.

The counters: Other early pool builds can counter this as they will have more lings and go for a counter attack

1373564704.0,1i3ecp,ZvX Counter Build Order Timings. Their Importance and Meanings,bauski,14,0,3,"This thread is actually in response to u/lykideaus who started a thread called ""[Build Orders](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/1hxd7j/build_orders/)"" where he was asking about ZvX build orders. The awesome people here at r/ss where able to answer with great resources for him to get build orders

So here is my response to him

&gt;I realize that your build should depend on what you scout

Since everyone else has answered the second question I'll answer your first!


As a Zerg, but what's also important is to know what times you need to scout for things. Day9, on his show, constantly talks about timings to look out for. You can either ask other people to get these timings, but what I've found personally valuable is just playing a lot of games and getting the timings in grained in your head. Even just yesterday I just because my scouting timing was 30 seconds too late, and now I'll never forget that timing again.


**ZvZ**

First let me begin with ZvZ. The timings that matter most in ZvZ are in the beginning cause that's when a lot of big pushes can come in.

When you send in your drone in the beginning you can check for pool, so if they are mining gas, you can check against your gas to see how much they have mined. Also, if you can, stay in long enough to see if they stop taking gas at a certain point.

If they are taking gas early it means they are doing a quick something or other. It might be a zergling speed push, be aware that you may want to sacrifice some lings sometimes just to see what they have. If it feels like they are hiding things from you, then you can be sure a push is coming.

Preparing for early game pushes from Zerg is pretty easy. a couple of spines will help, then counter roaches with spines and queens will win you the battle.

Now depending on what kind of damage you or they dealt in the early game will correspondingly dictate what their mid game unit composition will be. But don't forget with early overlord speed

If they went heavy roaches or heavy baneling usage, they will most likely go into hydras. Not only do hydras cost a little less, they are also a great combination with roaches. This doesn't negate the fact, however, that later in the mid game, opponents who are ahead will usually make 6 mutas just to be a pain in the but.

If they have been harassing most of early game with zerglings and never make anything else, you've generally put yourself into a very good position. But if you do not use economy advantage quickly the muta count will get too big in just a quick 5 minutes.

Generally as of late, so I guess you don't really have to worry about that.

Broodlords used to be very good, but they could really use a buff.


**ZvT**

I'm mostly playing Terran these days so this will probably be the most helpful for you.

Terrans are kind of special in their production abilities. Unlike Zerg or Protoss with warp tech, if you know what buildings they have, you are pretty much good to go. You know how much they can make, how big their pushes are going to be, and how much you need to prepare and swarm over them.

The best zergs I've played against have always had slightly more units than me at all times, and thus tech faster and get to their end game composition faster. Which is exactly where you would want to be if you are playing ZvT.

Early game is yours to win or lose as a Zerg. I've seen more then 2 base 30 baneling busts now this season alone. Sometimes with roaches, I actually get happy cause I know I'll win soon. What actually seems to work better is play like you're going for a half ass baneling bust and then get a 3rd a little later. The econ might be a little slow in the beginning but having the right defenses can really help you.

Cause the late early game timing is what you have to look out for. Marine widow mine drops can be deadly. Hellbat drops can also be deadly, and I think I have a guaranteed 70% chance of destroying it. That doesn't mean I win the game, but it does give me a huge advantage. Not only that, my micro is getting better, and I can imagine better players than me coming up with better splits, better chokes, pretty much taking care of your early game zergling/baneling defenses.

Thankfully all the pushes I just mentioned can be scouted quite early on. Zerlings at the front of their base will most likely help you see what the unit composition is, hatch, speed, banelings, and then overlord speed, and have an overlord ready at the side of their base, you can usually figure out everything 1 minute before they want to do anything. Which is the most valuable timing to either put down spore crawlers, or get queens

If they are going hellbats, and an armory. In that case, you will want to make 2 more queens to hang out next to your home queens, put down 2 spore crawlers (one at each mineral line) and a roach warren to pump like 6 roaches. Why so many queens? Because they are the only anti air you have, and have enough HP to last for a while vs hellbats as your roaches come to help you out. Remember to take care of the medivacs first, and then the hellbats. If you aren't used to dealing with everything, I suggest ignoring drone movement, then each hell bat.

If they are going banshee hellion, and then a roach warren for the hellions. You can't take back map control, but you can have just enough roaches to take your third and go into the midgame. Banshees can't win against 1 queen and 1 spore, so as long as you save most of your workers you'll be okay.

If they are going widow mine drops with marines, and more than 1 rax. Spores, again are key, but instead of putting them in the mineral line this time, put them near your queen. A spine at each mineral line ain't bad either. Or instead of going static defense, you could make zerlings and banelings as defense. But do be careful, they will probably strike you at two different places like the banshee hellion attack.

So generally, and if there is an early factory you can bet its going to either be hell bats, hellions, or mines, in the early game, and if there are a ton of rax, then it will probably be a timing push.

Mid Game is a different beast completely. I don't know how most good zergs will get through it, having defensive mutas is a huge boon imo. You don't necessarily want to use them for straight up engagements, put if you have some good overlord watches on the side of the map, you can start picking off drops all the time. All you will want to do vs bio mine is try and save all your bases, while trading effectively. baneling mines are a good idea. The terran will try to expand at least twice during this section, which will feel like an infinite, but that's good. Try to do zergling run bys, bonus

There are 2 different situations that can arise. He will either have horrible econ and macro, and decent econ, in which case you should try to take it into the late game now.

Either way you want to get to tech 3 while you're defending in the mid game. This way you can get cracklings with 3/3 and mutas with 3/3 and banelings with 3/3 first. That will put you in the second situation I talked about which is great. Cause then you can start thinking about late game armies. With mutas taking down drops, ultras, and a ton of zerglings. Use the 1 zergling at a time to scout out mines. Use an overseer and broodlord to take out said mines, then inch closer and closer with ultras at the front and hydras in the middle. At any point if things are getting too hairy somewhere else, take your bunches of zerglings and go defend. Don't worry broodlords, ultras and hydras by themselves in the middle of the map are going to be okay. Of course getting some caster units will also always help at any point in the game... if you know how to use them effectively, which is always hard in such a fast paced match up.

So that's vs bio-mine.

What about mech? The defenses against drops will still be mutas. There isn't really anything better. Another thing that'll help is the have extra queens for defense at home, and more econ, the better you will be late game, cause you don't want to go late game. Late game mech is stronger than ever. Especially with healable hellbats that can soak of zerglings, and tanks that can take down banelings, roaches and hydras, and thors that can take down mutas and ultras, but I can guarantee they'll have a plan for that a swell.

What's bets would be to keep it mid game for ever. Keep on trading units/sniping units. It'll be hard, they will be far behind on upgrades from you which will help allow you to trade more effectively.

Sniping: try mutas to tanks

For mid game pushes to stomp them, so if you do a push into their main, take out thors and turrets asap. Then mutas can come in and take up tanks first, and then workers, leaving hellbats standing around awkwardly.


**ZvP**

Phew this is turning into a long article. Its been ages since I've played Protoss or ZvP so I can't really say much about it, ZvP shouldn't be all that different. Like ZvZ, Protoss can warp in units really quickly when they need to, which makes their pushes quite deadly. But just like Terran they're production is all very easy to see.

I usually don't see Protoss doing a lot of early game pushes, is a strong one, and especially with the mother ship core they can warp back home any time. Another good one is proxy oracles so watch out for that as well. Whatever may come though, just like the ZvT, if you get speed, than baneling nest and then the overlord you can easily scout out their tech early on. If they do go FFE though, then you'd take a third

Since I can't really help you with ZvP I'll just say this. There is a subreddit called r/spoilerfreestarcraft where they have videos of big tournaments that have happened recently. Go there

1369346795.0,1exkdx,Terran Thoughts on Build Orders and Timings,bauski,18,3,4,"**Preamble**


Today I wanted to talk about Build Orders.


Last week, and started to break down his builds. While working on this latest project, some questions and ideas popped up, and I wanted to share them with you. So with out further ado, lets start...


**What is the purpose of a build order?**


When I first started playing sc2 I would watch pro games and try and mimic build orders that I found to be cool


By my own way, I was inspired by Puma's 1/1/1 and tried to do it every game (with much failure).


At that time it didn't matter where the builds lead, I just straight up did whatever I wanted to and made it fit. With enough builds, and good scouting, and intuitive play, I was able to get out of most situations decently.


But watching Innovations starting builds now


**Good builds are openings that follow your strategy


Watching Innovation do his TvZ, gas, factory, reactor and then 3rd so that he can get his bio-mine parade going at full steam. This build changes slightly from one map to another, depending on the zergling count or percieved pressure, but the build groups stay the same.


His second build is for 2 player maps where he pops out 1 reaper to start harassing and scouting


If you watched him vs Symbol last night, after 3 games of cheese, and 2 losses, to account for early game pressure from a 2 base zerg, by going tanks instead of the quick 3rd base.


**But no matter what build he has done it has always ended at the same place.** A point where he feels safe enough to push out


**Each of his builds accounts for different things that are possible in the early game, than econ has to be put on the back seat to prepare for pushes.


**All of this was done to follow the rules he applied for himself in the strategy phase of the game.** Innovation loves the beginning of mid game, and mixing drops in to keep the zerg pressured from 11 minutes on. His favorite thing in the whole world is to start mid game with pressure and keep it going forever.


**The purpose of build orders is to stream line the paths of the early game to maximize your strategy.**


**What is the purpose of timings**


All build orders have weaknesses. As Artosis has said, expand. If he expands, attack."" No matter what your build order asks for, there will be some build orders others do that will work effectively against yours.


For instance, and relies on hellion and reaper harassment/containment to keep the opponent busy. Going by Artosis' quote, Innovation is ""expanding"" with this build order. So what is this weak to? Straight up attack. And this is what lost Innovation 2 games in a row.


When Symbol's attacks were meak, with delayed timings because ""expanding"" doesn't give a shit to minor harassment. But once Symbol went into ""all ins"" or stronger attacks, Innovations early game weaknesses came out. And from there, Innovation had to slowly switch up his build from ""expanding"" into ""defending"" because he knew Symbol was switching his builds from ""harassing/expanding"" into ""attacking"".


So what does this have to do with Timings? Timings are possible permutations of attacks that an opponent or you can do. How are they relevant to build orders? **Timings allow a player to fix/mask the weaknesses in his build order.**


I know this is a little confusing so let me give some examples.


Here was my [first write up](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/1ckj6z/thoughts_as_a_terran_for_the_month_of_april/) when I started playing Terran last month. In it I talk about how I want to go bio mine


In it, then these 3 barracks are early and useless. So why do I get them?


1. I got them because I wanted them for my over strategy of bio-mine play.
2. I wanted them because I was scared.


But then at the end I talked about how effective pushing at a random 7 minute timing with 14 marines was. Why was this working so well for me?


Going through the things we learned today now we can understand why. If we look at my build truth fully


But there is 1 hybrid that works in certain match ups. **If you are the race that trades more efficiently in battles


My 7 minute push versus zerg


**The second and other important point of ""timing"" is to maximize the push at the end of your build.**


All builds must end. Mid game is a tricky beast, or you may lose all of your army, what then? **The longer the game goes on, the more general and useless a build order becomes.**


So the most optimal build orders will end when the generalities of events and scenarios becomes too big. **A Good build order with a strong timing will put the reign of dictated behavior in your hands


This is what Innovation's build order does for him. At 11 minutes, and from there on out, it is his game. All of the build order before is to get to this point. This last attack signals the start of his never ending push. A end timing should lead you into your control, not put you in a deficit. 


**Divergence in the Build**


The last thing I want to talk about is divergence in your build order. So far I've talked about having build orders that follow your strategy


Talking about Innovations 3 or 4 builds that I've seen so far, it has always just come down to the same amount of buildings doing the exact same thing each time.


Sure, instead of a marine, or some marauders are made, but in the end, the buildings all ""switch places"" to where they are meant to be, and by the start of his push, Innovation was back at square 1.


Knowing the weaknesses in your build, I personally think the best option is to focus on one build, play around with the different timings on buildings, and when they are made, to counter certain things.


For instance


All of the builds I just listed have very different timing attacks that can deal with very different army compositions


Having variations on the same build order can give you more timings that can mask more of your deficiencies. But it's always important to know what your strategy is first and know where you are going.


**Conclusion**


So the next time you are working on your own build order remember some key things to make sure that you are maximizing the efficiency of your product.


1. What is my strategy?

2. Does my build order direct me towards my strategy?

3. What are some weaknesses to my build order?

4. What timings can I use to fix/mask those weaknesses?

5. What is the end timing of my build order

1345951796.0,yu6cp,Two larvae inject methods,achristes,15,3,20,"Long time no post

One of the most important Z mechanics is larvae inject

**Backspace**

This is probably the most know. Before you can do it you need to go to: Hotkeys&gt;Global&gt;Camera and change ""Base Camera"" to a fitting key (usually this is the key above TAB, you must have all inject queens on the same ctrl group.

To execute it, hold shift, while holding shift press the ""base Camera"" hotkey and click once for every time you press the ""Base Camera"" hotkey.

* | = Base Camera

* 5 = Queen ctrl group

* v = Inject

5 , | , click , | , click , etc

This method has it's drawbacks, but if you screw it up your queens will derp around all over the place, if you know you made a mistake you can press S (default stop hotkey) to stop them, but you will have to start over.

I would use this in lategame scenarios

**Location**

Back to the camera tab in the hotkey menu again, shift+F2 etc), then bind the 8 ""Jump to Location"" hotkeys to match (for this would be F1, F2, F3 etc). You don't need to go over 5, because after that this method will be troublesome (time for backspace method!), but it can be useful for jumping between bases to upgrade/defend from drop etc

This is a more manual method of the backspace one, then jump to location 1, inject+click.

* F1 = Location 1

* F2 = Location 2

* F3 = Location 3

* 5 = Queen ctrl group

* v = Inject

F1 , click , F2 , v , click , F3 , v 

This method is best when you are on 3base with 4hatches or less, but you have waaay more control as it takes a little bit longer, but if you are used to it you can pull it off pretty fast (if you're on 4 hatcheries or less). Just a tip, if you are a perfectionist like me, you can select the hatchery and click on the portrait to center you screen on the hatch.

These are probably not the best methods, and if you don't like to put your hatches/queens in individual ctrl groups they should be nice for you too.

Now that summer has started I've finally been putting more time into ladder. Very quickly I've noticed that I just can't seem to win versus Zergs. My TvT and TvP aren't perfect

---

Talking to other Diamond+ Terrans such as this subreddit's own NoseKnowsAll

I think I have narrowed it down to the fact that I can never seem to push  (at least with my current composition of marine/tank/medivac). The reason for this is because of creep.

Creep is forcing me to either severely delay my push to the point where my timing is all messed up

How my games go when there is no all-in or anything else non-standard:

I do a macro build. 1rax FE into a few hellions

The Zerg player takes a quick 3 bases

The attack takes so long to cross the creep that he either has Hive tech units out

Basically

I don't have replays for a couple reasons:

I'd like to change my build up basically entirely. 

Many games have been with Zergs all-inning then dying to a timing push.

I haven't played against many Zergs on ladder. Playing basically 90% TvT and TvP.

What I'm looking for:

Any advice on completely re-looking at the matchup?

Any different builds that could possibly help slow down the creep (I've been looking into banshee/raven opening)?

I know at a certain point the zerg player will end up either getting a number of corrupters up or getting enough of a hydra mass to deal with the pheonixes but I am not sure how to anticipate the point where pheonixes will stop being useful.

I haven't had a lot of chances to really try this out (see above statement about meh FF's), made the sentries a lot more useless (G-shield is still good, but their DPS isnt the best) and I was able to ""hug"" his army and seemed to get a lot more value out of my roach hydra ball.

After a few weeks experimenting with bio v mech i can say i will never go back to mech in TvT. I feel that this is part of my play style but i would also encourage other terrans to try out Bio v mech

Now i know mech is the standard because a group of sieged up tanks will beat a group of charging infantry no question. I have found though that it is a lot easier then you think to catch players off guard with their tanks then you might think. If you let a mech player get to your base and siege you probably lose. However

I have found the simplest trick to take your meching opponent by surprise is to leave a marine outside his base

Other benefits to this bio style i have found is earlier expansion, gaining you a advantage along with your earlier expansion. Following up your initial attack is the next step usually with stim and combat shields and sometimes a +1 depending. After a hellion drop or banshee fails the next logical step is to get tanks, siege up and defend a natural. This is the best time to attack. Bc they invested in drops they will at best have 2 tanks by the time your stim push comes and maybe one bunker while your army should be vastly superior. Do not be warded off by 1 tank and a bunker stim in a snipe both easily, its a lot of fun to do so. 

From this point on i usually like to secure a third

If they do not go for a drop and go right for marine tanks you will still win if you fight them before sieged up

This kind of TvT is interesting to get used to but if this sounds like your play style of being active

*going to edit a lot on Sunday 21.04.*


Hello my friends

You're welcome to add your opinion or correct me if analysed something wrong or forget something to mention especially i am especially unsure about the openings part. Furthermore I am a human and its late;) and sry if my english is not the best i am not a native speaker :)

Notice: This ignores all 4 Player maps so i defently will scout my opponent in time. Tournament Maps like star Station are with force positioning anyway (and I guess it will get on ladder later on too)


Until now I noticed that they are 3-4 Types openings evolving to metagame: First of all there is the very commen 3 stalker opening into tech. Mostly combined with DT or oracles. The negative side of this build is that it need to do some dmg
(I dont feel like i need to save the BO here


The next one is a one (some people do it with  2

1 Gate Expo 

15/15 Gas (2

zealot, Expand

around 16/3/3 do a small probe cut and get 2 gates then Robo)

hallu scout react

The advantage is
--&gt; NO PROBE SCOUT! Just vs Proxys!


The last Build Order i want to give you is the 1 Gate Tech

15/15 Gas

3 in both gas

1 zealot

1 sentry + chrono 

At 27 - Stargate

1 sentry WITHOUT chrono

add 2 gates (maybe small probe cut)

ca 36 MC + Expo

--&gt; NO WORKER SCOUT!

In any case your MC should go to scout for proxy Stargates near your base



As next i want reroll the following game from the very late game to the lategame and mid game. ( In this discurs i won't speak so much about kollosi/archon vs kollosi archon and gateway tech vs gateway tech

Our very ending composition is about a hell of Tempests, you can dominate your opponent as much as you want. In the end there is no way to win very late game fights without Tempests.

You are on 4-5 bases, at least not without risking your main army because its way to small to deal with the opponents one. And the MC give your opponent allways the possibility to kill an expension and TP then back to his base where you desperatly try to snipe 2-3 Techbuildings.

I am very sry



But well let's take a step back how does this escalated this quickly? We opened up kinda safely

What I love about PvP is the mid and late game. Because it's all about scouting what is your opponent is doing and reacting to it because: In generell its Robo/Kollosi &gt; blink/charge/Archon/HT &gt; Phoenix,5 - 2 ingame minutes so you can watch the tech switches of your opponent.
Sadly i can't talk about all possible transitions from openings into midgame. But since the most should be kinda known from WoL i just want to speak about one. I also recommend to build a Robotics at a certain point of the game because the opponent can allways switch to DTs to kill your ground army (+ Cannons for your Bases)


Fighting vs stargate. You are on 2 base. And no matter what you Follow up were you should try to get a third as fast as possible and safe as necessary!Minigun suggested an Expension around 11.30.  You will need it to stronger your eco for a second tech path. Because in all cases you will need a second techpath sooner or later. (It could be even necessary to play with all 3 tech pathes in late game: Kollosi, 2 Base = 2 Stargates, 3 base at least 3 Stargates. The next question is about the upgrades: I think you should start to get +1 Attack on 2 base, and when u get your third also went for the fleet beacon to get the range and follow it up by + 2 and a second Core for defence upgrades. Another departure is to go for +1+1 and while go for the defence Upgrade to build the Fleet Beacon.

1 Phoenix does not kill another faster but because it attacks two times the attack upgrade is stronger then the defensive one.

BUT! The most important is the range upgrade. If you have it and the oponent doesn't
So much about you going to stargate by yourself. But what are you going to do when you didn't went to stargate? You die


Just kidding^


If you didn't went for stargate you have to sit a bit more defensivly. You should add a twilight for high templar tech. To be honest
If you see HT coming by your opponent you should add Kollosi but in most times he will transition sooner or later into Tempest. And if you dont kill him now when the number is low u get problems with killing them just with stalker

Since the map is roughly the shape of an X

Korhal also looks a lot like a 2v2 map since your natural expansion is pretty much a freebie

I'm currently a nooby gold league Zerg player. I was wondering if there are hotkeys to perform the following functions (or programmable macros

1) Select all of one specific unit (ie select all roaches
2) Select all the detectors
3) Return all the workers that I burrowed back to whatever they're doing just like WC3
4) Select 3 workers out of a pile quickly (for gas)

1356510757.0,15glkf,A few Beginner level Terran Questions,PEWPEWCHEWCHEW,15,4,10,"1. In bronze League I see a lot of TvP stalker spam. In early game situations would it be better to simply have more Marauders or more marines does it change depending on whether or not I have stim? According to the game's help section Marauders are supposed to counter stalker spam

2. When expanding should the first thing you produce be the orbital comm upgrade assuming it's in a safe low risk place? Is the mule drop worth more than the amount of SCVs you can produce during the upgrade time?

3. I see hellions being used a lot against zerg. What makes them so appealing? Assuming I start off with dual rax 1 lab one reactor and expansion

4. Relatively which faction expands the fastest and which the slowest?

5. In regards to Medevac drops

6. I see that Medevacs are sometimes used simply as support healers during a battle. How much of a combat multiplier is this? Can Two Medvacs heal one unit? 

7. Just how situational are Reapers? I often forgo them in favor of either banshees or air drops. Apart from that

8. What is the point of getting the concussive shells? Is it simply to help chase and kiting?

9. How do you judge when to stim? When on offense do we stim before engagement to run in? Should we selective stim in certain situations. Ex early stalker spam

10. I hear from people that Battle Cruisers are underpowered

11. What is a good way to set and control tempo?

12. Against Mutalisk spam

13. Can somebody explain the practical uses for the Raven? Apart from being a detector I don't find very much use for this unit. How do the two turrets work? Does the seeker rocket help against Mutalisk spams? Does the energy Regen make constant use of it's abilities viable? What exactly does the point defense drone help out with? How many missiles does the point defense drone deal with?

The most obvious keyboard tip everybody knows is to use hotkeys instead of clicking. Common sense. 

Here's something I just learned today that may be common sense to everyone else:

I was watching pros warm up their hands and took close notice of their hand placement. A glaring problem in my play is that I often look down at my keyboard a LOT. I realized all pros don't have freakishly huge hands; they just don't use wrist rests on their keyboards which allows them to hit all the essential keys easily.

Now that I've taken my wrist rest off

Is there a big hand placement/keyboard control guide on TL that I have missed? Do you guys have more tips to help those who can think faster than they can find the keys?

EDIT: Although ""play more games"" can be a valid answer, etc. I've played close to 3,000 games and will continue to play, ""play more"" isn't constructive feedback.

I am the creator of the University of Reddit course ""Official Starcraft II Strategy"" and I started my show a couple of weeks ago which focuses on becoming a better Starcraft II player. The mods have been nice enough to let me use /r/starcraft_strategy  as a platform for discussion for my class. Hopefully this will give us more content to actually analyze rather than simple ""Help!"" posts followed a generic comment answer.

Link to the class: http://ureddit.com/class/48233/official-starcraft-ii-strategy

**What is this all about?**

The Official Starcraft II Strategy is going to be something like a mini Day[9] daily from one of our coaches. Each class can be anywhere from 10 minutes to and hour long session that focuses on a specific aspect of the game. Our first lecture was on scouting as protoss in the early game shown here: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MUJPpWhKik&amp;feature=plcp

Although I admit I have a lot to work on

**What makes you different from all the other players putting out tutorials?**

We have sources like Day[9], however I haven't seen any sort of collaboration for collective learning. My goal is to have a solid roster of very good players/coaches that will be able to teach specific lessons (e.g how to scout, hotkey setups, and timings). With a collective mindset, we can take a look at different perspectives from other players.

**How often are you putting out content?**

As of right now we are doing Tuesday and Thursday nights (we don't have a regular starting time so please register for the class to receive the updates). I will be posting the announcements and VODs on this subreddit so we can all discuss it.

**Who is teaching?**

This is actually a big issue right now and a big reason why I would love help from this subreddit. Initially we had myself (1300+ master last season), and formal member of Quantic gaming decemvre. Sasquatch had to leave because of his full time contract with complexity and decemvre left willingly. We would love to have high master/GM level players to come help out. Please email me at senseigamingceo@gmail.com if you are interested.

**Where can I watch?**
Each time a coach has a lesson, and where they can find the stream. You can always find the VODs in order on the site and also check this subreddit for the posted thread.

TL;DR: Casual webshow Tuesday and Thursdays that will be posted on this subreddit to provide helpful tips on becoming a better Starcraft II player from the University of Reddit.

Today I just wanted to write my thoughts on what are some of the best ""easy compositions"" you can use to start winning a lot of games in the lower leagues. These compositions don't require fancy micro or lots of multitask and they are versatile
  
ZvX: Roach Ling (+Infestor optional)  
PvX: Stalker Colossus OR Chargelot Archon  
TvX: Marine Marauder Medivac  
    
I think these compositions are robust enough that you can pretty much make them blindly and be okay in 90-95% of games. Sometimes you will die if your opponent does something wacky like Sky Terran

If he attacks before I have brood lords, then i just lose to the death ball. If he attacks after I have broodlords, I just lose to an archon toilet. Nothing seems to work out in my favor, and I'm starting to get pretty disillusioned in this matchup.

-----------
###What is it?

[/r/starcraftbuilds](/r/starcraftbuilds) is a subreddit experiment that will be run by the community. The idea is that the subreddit will act as a place to learn, or experiment with build orders relevant to the current metagame of starcraft II. If you are someone who's looked up builds on Team Liquids [Liquipedia](http://wiki.teamliquid.net) in the past, I'm sure you've found that the wiki can occasionally be hopelessly out of date. The goal of this subreddit is to create an up to date archive of build orders, and allowing discussion or refinement of the builds as the metagame shifts. 

'But how do you make a archive with Reddit? Wouldn't builds disappear after a few days?' you might ask. If you have ever been to [/r/music](/r/music) or the [SFW porn network](http://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn) you will have seen the pull down menus they got going on over there. This subreddit uses the same feature



###How will it work?

The community will be essential to running this subreddit. Posting new builds, etc, will fall (for the most part) into the hands of the community. I've tried to throw together as many quality builds as possible before introducing this subreddit. You will find its packed with SC2 audio builds along with a few select builds from Liquipedia as those are the two best sources for build orders (that I know of). I'm sure once we get a more active community and a proper group of knowledgeable moderators(As the sole mod, I'm neither a group nor knowledgeable) the quality and quantity of the the builds on this subreddit will increase. 

Notice a build missing from the subreddit? make a post! Got a replay of yourself performing a build? feel free to post it. Got a problem with holding a 1 rax FE vs 4gate? Feel free to ask questions or open a discussion. 


###We need moderators

If the idea of this subreddit interests you, and prior subreddit moderating experience would be preferred.

My problem has been defending the expansion. I get to the point where I need to expand and so I do. I build about 2 more cannons and move my forces in front of the expand. That is normally when the comp comes and destroys me with a superior force. I suck at micro


I noticed when I expand I start getting a lot of minerals that I honestly am not really using. So

For me recently I've been real frustrated with PvZ. I decided to just go balls out aggression at all points of the game and its been working. It goes like this:

* Do a 1 gate zealot pressure, ect. (Seen kiwi do this a lot)

* Transition into double stargate play with void rays. (Makes you safe to any roach counter attack and they likely aren't ready for it in a pub)

* Transition into double robo colossi because they probably went hydra.

It's a stupid build with so much tech off of 2 base. Logic dictates that it *shouldn't* work but it's dumb enough that it does. I usually stay fairly low early on for gateway counter (like 4-5) which lets me get these big tech units earlier. 

So what about you guys. What dumb ass builds do you have that seem to work on the ladder? 

**edit:** I've done this more tonight.. still have won *every single* PvZ I've done so far with it. This last game I ended up sniping off his tech with the voids so he wasn't able to get out enough corruptors in time to deal with the colossi.

1324763420.0,npidm,TvZ Reapers into +1 Double Marine Drop,NoseKnowsAll,16,2,17,"Fed up with hellion openers in TvZ

**Overview**

Basically

**Build**

Default opener - 10 depot, 15 orbital.

Then depending on whether or not a worker is still in my base I will get the first marine out or insta-techlab.

Once techlab finishes start producing reapers one at a time (eventually stopping with the third).  

With first 400 mins start second CC and with first 100 gas start stim (both around when 1st reaper pops).

Follow up with 2 more barracks which will both get reactors as soon as they finish and factory with next 100 gas.  I usually throw down second gas geyser when barracks are halfway down but I'm still messing with the timings.

Next is Engibay for +1 attack

Swap off the factory and starport

**Goals**

With your reapers you are not trying to do much damage or even any damage at all.  Instead

With the marine medivac drop

**Transitions**

Obviously this transitions well into marine tank medivac and not at all well into mech.  My suggestion is that during the drop you should throw down in this order: a 3rd CC, and then possibly 2 or 3 more barracks to truly become a 3 base terran player.  Mutas are coming soon so prepare a solid defense with your reinforcement marines and turrets where necessary.

**Replays**

In this first game I perform a solid drop but have a very weak transition because I did not quite know what buildings and such I should be building.

http://starcrafting.com/replays/sc2replay-download.php?key=84SZV3 

In this second game, because I slowed the build down and he didn't build any roaches the drop actually gets to his base after his first couple of mutas pop, but luckily they go straight to my base and avoid my drop.  Another solid drop but because he has faster banelings, I lose a lot because I fail at focus fire.  In terms of transitions everything looked pretty good except I forgot my upgrades and he killed the scv building the second factory.  Eventually, I get to earn sweet sweet zerg ""imba marine"" tears.

* I already know I don't have godly macro (only goldy).
* I am aware that I didn't harass really, according to the graph, he was only slightly ahead of me during that time.
* I probably should have made widow mines.  During the game
* I definitely could have won with an early bio attack.  Like, and I don't like attacking early with mech because I consider it an investment that needs to be paid off and usually will just bite me in the ass if I attack with like three hellbats and a tank.  Maybe I wasn't thinking properly, but I still don't think I could have mounted an early attack with the mech.
* I probably could have done some damage shortly after one of the only offensive engagements I won.  I only had two ish thors and nothing else really.  I didn't like the idea of him rushing my guys with lings and raping them, I don't really think that was a bad move.
* I don't think any of the above problems caused me to lose, the bottom two I still don't think was a particularly poor decision considering the intel I had (remember, not dropping, so not very much intel, though I did scan from time to time so I knew his army composition), and with the widow mines I don't think it would have been enough to turn the tide of the game.

If you've ever seen sick forcefields, and any unit control that dazzles you and makes you get nerd chills, you've been watching ""micro."" Micro-management is a concept that refers to a player's control of their individual units on the battlefield, as opposed to macro-management which refers to the management of your economy (making workers, supply depots, making buildings, making units
  
While I am writing here to emphasize the value of good micro, think about the ""value"" of different actions in Starcraft. What's better: stutter-stepping your marines perfectly to save 3 or hitting your production cycle to produce 10 marines?  
  
Thus, assuming you can only do one well at a time.  
  
Let's say you have a crazy APM, don't queue). Now, you can use micro!  
  
What are the different kinds of micro you can utilize? There are plenty of them
  
1. Battle Micro. This is the most important kind of micro, target-fire, spread your units out, pull weakened ones back, bring in that flank, etc. This kind of micro is CRUCIAL as there are so many units that can die in a fight, if you are able to battle effectively
2. Stutter-Step. Think about marines. When they're micro'd, or you see it with tempests or broodlords. It's also common in other games like DOTA and LoL, so needless to say: stutter-step is actually quite effective for improving the efficiency of your units.  
3. Target-fire. This is pretty simple. Let's say I am playing a blink stalker vs blink stalker fight. If my opponent simply A-moves at me and I tell my stalkers all to shoot the same stalker, make sure you use it to target down colossus with vikings, broodlords, etc.  
4. Pull-back micro. Very simple. If something is dying
5. Splitting. This is most important against splash damage units, etc. Splitting is quite hard and I wouldn't recommend practicing it too much as it takes a lot of time to learn well.  
6. Spell-casting. This is pretty much just landing your spells properly. This is actually really important
  
  
There are some other kinds of micro, stacking air units (mutalisks), shift-blinking stalkers, etc. Don't worry too much about the more obscure types of micro if you're just starting off. These are just things to practice and think about. Keep on macroing hard and work these things in when you can!

**Derelict**

 Looks pretty normal. The middle isn't that exciting, the sides  won't be  used that much except for the rare few in our league. Probably by mid diamond you will see later mid game harassment using those chokes, but hopefully by then you'll have some supply depots over there.


What's really interesting is that, but there really aren't that many attack paths. Just that choke where your natural and 3rd are, and your 5th base ramp approach. One is right in the middle, and the other you have to attack into. This might be the most cross mappiest thing ever.


*Terran wise*

I'm still going to do my 8 minute marine timing that I always do, I'm going to start dropping a lot more on this map. Hopefully that gives me a chance to take my own expansions and take a good forced position on their 5th just past their rocks. If I can get that position, I'll be able to either break their 3rd or deny their 4th. Then do a nice drop into their main.



**Klontas**

 I was really confused about how you take your 4th on that map without budging out to the middle. The spawn distances are really close, that tricks people to be guarding their front from that small ass bridge, and then push down from the blocked rocks pass on the fourth as well as from the front.


After a while people are going to be able to take early naturals on that map, which no good player should allow them to, then you'll be able to position on that middle tip from your 4th and take the rest of your bases. So I think the biggest battles will be early game, mid game, and the late mid game for that position on the tip of the fourth. From that point whoever takes theirs with least amount of losses will win.


*Terran wise*

This would be such a good map for reapers. Reapers everywhere. Dropping in that main from the 3rd area, and so I'll go into expand and start doing parade pushes, which allows me to take my 3rd easily and then my fourth is also easily defended. It will be really bad against drops though, so I'll probably want to do a parade push and a drop at the same time sort of deal.


I'm most likely not going to do the 1 base 3 rax thing


TvT games on this map are going to be epic.


**Zerus Prime**

If Protoss doesn't win every game on this map I will have to laugh. Reapers can be easily denied since there are only two places to come in from (front and then the back), and because of the clear middle, the idea of sneaking bases is really hard. Once protoss gets a 3 base death ball, they should push out into the middle, take control of the two towers, and just starve the other guy to death. I think this is a great map for protoss to try practicing air while being very defended. I say this because you can only have horizontal or cross spawn on this map, and have you looked at the vertical gaps? That is perfect for doing some air harass


*Terran wise*

Defending against protoss 3 gate expand will be hard on this map. I can almost die to it normally now, or anything else sketchy, I obviously defend. If I don't I'll do my 8 minute marine push at the front and then if the force looks too big and well prepared, I'll drop back and then destroy their rocks and then do another front push and keep them occupied for a second or two. Then I'll probably go into parade mode... maybe, I don't know. With so much easily defend-able chokes for protoss for Protoss and the openess in the middle for zerg, I'm gonna need more experience playing it before I make any more plans.

If you are 2 or 3 below your opponent, you should be able to do damage (6pool pwns hatch first or even pool-hatch).  
  
For Ladder, and it saves you the worry of instant losses to cheese. Cheese will not be easy to hold, but it will be a lot more do-able.  
  
In the pros, Violet, DRG, and Nestea use early pools - it's really frequent to keep their opponents honest.  
  
Assuming you have 2 base up and you were not cheesed, roach baneling, roach ling, or pure roach. You need to ascertain which build he is doing by running a ling in. If he is blocking off the ramp and doesn't have an expand, sacrifice an overlord in to see what he's doing. Here are the easiest responses to the 1 base allins:  
  
Ling Bane: Spine
Roach Ling: 2-3 spines
Roach Bane: 3-4 spines
Roaches: 4 spines
  
You will have to micro to hold these, so make sure you make 2 lings when your pool pops to scout him out.  
  
If he's two base, and ling-bane are all common for a 2 base non-droning player. You can identify he is doing a 2 base allin by using a speedling to see his drone count at natural (lots of drones = few units and vice versa), sacrifice an overlord, poke with an overlord to see what's popping from the eggs, and so forth.  
  
The responses to the 2 base allins are basically the same as the 1 base allins, sure Nestea does it but he is a God of ZvZ and we are not.  
  
If you do not see him allining, because at home all you need to do is 4sd4sd4sd and injects until you see aggression.  
  
Ling bane micro: I will just say here that this can determine how hard you are allowed to drone. If you get good hits, though I wish they had one like Marine Split Challenge.  
  
**ZvZ Mid-Game**  
The midgame is, you need to have an overlord near the main and near the 3rd, so you can make an overseer and scout his Lair tech as well as seeing his 3rd base timing.  
  
I would recommend going roaches as you go Lair, your economy will suck and you will lose the roach battle to someone who teched more prudently.  
  
Once your 3rd/Lairs are building
-Is he taking a 3rd? If not
-Does he have lair yet? If so
  
The best ways to answer these two questions are with the overlord at his third. You can pop it in towards his natural and look at the gasses. If he has all 4 gasses, you MUST overseer into his base to identify his tech.  
  
A note on gasses: for roach-infestor play, or send drones to mine minerals to get more roaches (I would recommend infestor count, personally).  
  
If muta is coming down, but there's no way you will have the infestors out in time for the initial harass.  
  
If he is also playing roach-infestor, which will make it significantly stronger.  
  
Make sure you get creep spread, just because burrow can mess up your life, plus those other things will help you a lot in getting good army positioning.  
  
IMO, but they are so slow to get to and slow to use, it's just unsafe to go there unless you have a lead or you play really defensively, which would allow your opponent to take a 4th with no issue.  
  
A note about ling-infestor-ultra: This style is really hard to use properly. You need to counter attack constantly, and then survive pre-ultra timings which are very scary. I would not recommend this style, I think it's just slightly inferior to roach-infestor(+hydra).  
  
**Late-Game ZvZ**  
This is largely a tactical time. There are many things going on here
-Drops. Lots of infestor drops
-Nyduses in the back of the main
-Ultras from ling-festor style are BEASTLY strong if you can survive long enough to get them.  
-Broodlords are very strong indeed
-Mass spines is really good
-Going Hive just for 3-3 is something I have seen
-Undefended expansions SHOULD be harassed, so go for that multi-pronged harass.

1344069933.0,xny73,TSL Symbol Build vs. Mech,adv23,12,1,6,"Overview

This is Symbols opening into late game against the typical Mech Terran which has very strong anti ground capabilities. It utilizes the early advantage of roach drops ontop of the army with only thor (or few vikings) as anti air. The +2 carapace reduces the splash of thors anti air severely and makes closing the distance to the mech army much easier or dropping against turrets easier. The Air Flyer upgrades synergizes well with the transition to broodlord/infestor as a the ultimate counter to the lategame mechechanical army.

Goal
This is a defensive build with strong upgrade timings aimed at pressuring a turtling mech player with Roach pressure and drops. It doesn't rely on doing economic damage

Here are a few things I noticed myself. I haven't played for a while so my interpretation might be outdated. Please correct me if I'm wrong.


*what to look for / interpretation*

ZvZ

* pool timing -&gt; build own pool 1 to 3 drones later (depending on map.)
* pull drones off gas at 100 -&gt; speedling + expand
* pool before gas -&gt; fast expand or roaches
* lot of spines early game -&gt; likely: roaches / mutas


ZvP

* first pylon at expand -&gt; fast expand
* nexus before forge -&gt; weak to 1 base all-ins
* lot of sentries on 2 bases -&gt; weak against mutas
* templar archive on 2 bases -&gt; expect HT / archons
* 7gates soon after 2 bases -&gt; 7gate all-in
* twilight timing? -&gt; [blink timing](http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/x3zfx/protoss_2_blink_attack/c5iyxy6) 
* gateway
* warps a pylon close to your base -&gt; timing push incoming.
* gas timing on expand -&gt; [gives a lot of info on follow-up](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/wtw7k/zv_scouting_info/c5gmfng)


ZvT

* gas soon after orbital -&gt; no early agression -&gt; possible hellions or banshee harass
* no gas by 15 ~ 16 supply -&gt; 2rax or fast expand
* overlord scouting at 5:00 gives away everything terran is up to.
* drops somewhere in your base -&gt; terran is trying to distract you from something.

1336885517.0,tkm7z,Carriers in PvP!,kengou,16,4,19,"Carriers in PvP are really

It's not super important how you open, anyone looking to play for the lategame (i.e. not a 2-base all-in) is GOING to switch into mass Colossus.  This is just a fact of modern PvP.  And because of that, they're going to have to sit in their base and assume you're also going Colossus.  The standard logic is that Colossi own any ground army except MORE Colossi, and that attacking is usually disadvantageous because concaves are so very important in mass Colossus battles.  So PvP becomes super turtly passive Colossus fests.  We capitalize on that by going mass Carriers instead, and by hiding them until critical mass.  Think of it like PvT in Brood War.  There's no really great answer to Carriers for Protoss.  All Protoss players know how crappy out anti-air is.  Stalkers are just bad units.  Void rays are made of glass.  Phoenixes don't do good damage against Carriers.  If you get out 10 or more, with +3 air weapons (+3 attack for carriers is absolutely critical) you're pretty much going to win the game.  And the best PvP ground army is going to be ground-to-ground focused, with little anti-air

Ok, generally not all-inning) I throw down a fleet beacon and get to 2 stargates.  I start making carriers, researching graviton catapult, and researching +air attack upgrades.  It's very important to have an observer by this point (to be safe from surprise DTs and to scout, you ought to have one anyway) and make certain there is no observer in your own base so he won't see your carriers.  The more money the other guy commits to expensive ground units like Colossi and Immortals and Archons, the further ahead you're going to be when you engage.

When you feel it's safe (based on scouting), and chargelot-archon, even in somewhat small numbers, will roll over stalkers.  Seriously, stalkers are bad :P  No need to sacrifice Carrier count for ground army, but you want your ground army to supplement your Carriers to the maximum.

Once at a critical mass of Carriers (usually 10+) and +3 air attack

The opponent is going to do a few things in response (hopefully he can't respond too early if you hide them well).  He might mass blink stalkers.  Charge zealots are good to deal with these, and splitting carriers can work to defend this, but it's a weakness of such a slow army.

He might go void ray.  Include a lot of stalkers in your ground army, hiding Carriers is important!) as well as unupgraded.

He might also go phoenix.  Again

Quick story on an expected ""Meta game shift"" : 

Yesterday I played a game where my opponent went mutas after seeing my stargate. I fought off his initial pack, the guy didn't understand how hard that upgrade counters mutas, and he went mass muta and destroyed me because I had skipped the upgrade. I mentioned this after he beat me, and he actually asked me to play another game with him so he could see how well phoenix counters mutas... I don't think he'll be going mutas anymore once a fleet beacon is on the map.

With all that in mind

* What do you think is the best ""late-game"" combo for PvP?
* When looking at timings - what do you think is the best time to make a switch to this ""late game deathball"" based on the success/failure of your early/mid game blinkstalker/2base-push (et al)
* How much does the opening you use effect this? Eg
* Is there a way to shift to late-game styles that doesn't get used *purely* because of how short PvP normally is? (Eg

TvP is not my strongest suite. In fact, is a cake walk at equal levels. T just has a lot of great ways to harass and put pressure on the Zerg right now, and if Z tries to put on the pressure, even better, as T can defend even more cost effectively.

TvT, but I've found a starting a build that borders on cheese, but works too well not to use. Hint: 3 rax, all reapers into an expand and hellbats.

TvP has, so I'm trying to get that into play more, but I like safe openings, so getting my medivacs out takes some time.

Usually I would go 1 rax, and then factory and starport with all the tech lab upgrades, and go into either a drop harass as I try to maximize my army, or just a straight up scv/bio push. The bio push is a stupid idea, because concave is so necessary in a TvP engagement.

While doing all of that, DPS wise, marines &gt; marauders. I would only begin making marauders right around the time the starport would start building.

But just now I was watching demuslim

Have I been making the mistake of not making enough marauders? If so, try and to maximize on marauders for my mid game interactions and harassment?

Any tips would be appreciated. Thank you.

1366862366.0,1d286e,Brief analysis on why I think mass stalker still works as an effective counter to mass void ray,Veshan,15,5,9,"One of the more frequent complaints about PvP in HOTS is that void rays seem to counter stalkers now. When the void rays have Prismatic Alignment on

Supply for supply (2-to-1 ratio): Voids dominate
Mineral for mineral (2-to-1 ratio): Voids dominate
Resource for resource (16-to-7 ratio): Voids win

But there's one metric we haven't considered yet:
Gas for gas (3-to-1 ratio): Stalkers dominate

A single base provides with 16 probes on minerals and 6 on gas gives ~672 minerals and ~215 gas per game minute

This does leave your opponent with an abundance of minerals

In addition, the gas-for-gas stalkers will not just win but completely annihilate void rays.

Blink stalker play also puts you on the tech track for the other counter to void rays, so are viable very late game). Also I'd argue it gives you map control if you've built enough stalkers to punish any movements out.

Overall

Comments/rebuttals welcome.

EDIT:

I did a followup that sadly suggests that charglot+stalker+HT is fragile against charglot+void. It's surprisingly easy to lose: the stalkers just get eaten too quickly by voids. It ends up relying on very good storm micro and luck. However

1352148484.0,12oqbj,ZvP: Punishing Greedy Protoss who goes Pheonix Harass,bauski,11,0,12,"This is an idea I just had while watching Liquid`Zenio on his stream. This is an instructional + discussion on play style as well as builds that focus on responding to a Fast Forge Expand Toss or Fast Gate Expand Toss that goes air to harass the Zerg while massing up a 2 base 6 gate

First let me explain some of the choices Zerg has to responding to such a situation:

1 base all in with zergling roach bust

2 base quick infestors or hyrdas + lings, for timing push right around first two phoenix

3 base semi-quick infestor or hydra defense, or to take 4th and defend against toss immortal or 6/7 gate push around 12 minutes.

4 base with late everything

------------------

Some of these strategies can win, being able to choose the right builds is a very important skill as well.

1 base all ins with stuff is a risky build, you will be hard pressed to win and be very behind in econ.

2 base quick infestors/hydras + roaches, so if you're going for a quick timing push, going hydras is recommended. But since they move so slow you will require very good creep spread, almost to the point where you either make more queens, or prioritize spreading directly to your opponent's base.

3 base is the most widely used build that allows for a very greedy economic advantage but require some knowledge of timings that the Protoss can use. A good Protoss will do an early scout push with 2 zealots, can lead to a pretty big hit on the budding econ. The good Protoss will then transition quickly into something for either another timing push or harass.

Against air most zerg will build a spore at each base, the zerg will be at an economical advantage, and once the 4th macro hatch is set, will be able to deftly handle the 2nd push that will come around 15 minutes (time is added because gas was used for phoenix harass).

4 base, which will most likely not happen. Another con related to this build is the amount of space that is required to be traveled. Just because a pheonix harass is happening does not mean the toss cannot send 4 zealots into your 4th and snipe it. A risky and silly maneuver that could only work relying in the fallacies of the player.

----------------

The idea behind the Toss's build and harass, stalkers, zealots, warp prism, sentries. Plus whatever phoenix are left can be a deadly deadly push.

Many Zergs allow this to happen, and is able to tech quickly enough, they will win in a fierce micro battle. But overall are always going for the max money army to win the game for them.

--------------------------

My suggestion for mid level players+ is to, go for a timing of your own.

So lets look at some of the 2 base pushes, make 2 spores and 1 queen at each place. Better to lose a bit of money now than lose 16 drones)

1. Mass zerglings: let's say you just make a ton of zerlings, and make a couple more cannons. Especially on maps with small ramps to the 2nd, you will have a lot of problems with breaking in. All the while, the phoenix will be harassing your base. Even though you could transition into a 3rd, unless you can get some setnries and probes, you will be in a losing situation, since you're only helping him/her make more sentries for his/her 15 minute army.

2. Zerlings and Roaches: with roaches to help your army, they will have immortals by that time and that will, again, be GG for the roahces.

3. Roaches and Hydras: a very strong army, and if you have less than 4, they will become useless as the phoenix can pick them up and yada yada yada. Also, with the quick tech up into hive, you will have less army than you would if you stayed in tier one, so the push will be less massive. Thankfully, when you push, since they take so long to cross the map.

4. Roaches and Infestors: Like the hydra den, infestors need that Pathgen Glands upgrade or they will not be very useful for the attack (maybe 2 or 3 infested terran for your earliest infestor... not that good) And again like the hydras, the roach and infestor could won't be that big. Another issue is that if you do not fungal the phoenixes precisely, you will lose a lot of gas as the phoenix eat your infestors.

------------------

This brings us to the build I wanted to share today.
2 base

1. At this time in the game, they are compromising their base defenses even further as they have very little gas for sentries. If they drop 2 more gas quickly to get more gas, you are now probably ahead mineral income wise.

2. Even with no quick tech and all sentries, but you can push and prod with your speedlings all you want. Where as with only mass zerlings, they only need 1 force field in the right location to stop all your guys, now they need to use 2~3 each time to also defend their buildings. The more zerlings and banelings you keep on threatening with, the more sentries they have to make. Thank means they can't push out with immortals faster. They can't make cols, or templars, or even other high gas units. Just sentries. The bigger your forces get the more they have to prepare. And if they don't make more sentries, and things will burst

3. At some point you can expand behind this: At some point the returns for the continuous zerglings won't be necessary, so why not? My suggestion is to go for the 3rd first, since you'll be mineral heavy, and then the lair, and then a macro. All of these are to keep more zerglings and drones popping, as well as get those infestors before the timing if you're push fails.

--------------------------------

I feel like the chances of your push failing are minimal. You are forcing force fields out of your opponent for very cheap prices

I feel like even with good scouting, the gas is very low for them

Even if we are being less greedy than most normal zergs, and still have even if not better playing fields.

I think most zergs who have tried baneling busts before know, because it seemed too ""cheesy"" this is a build that gets rid of the cheese factor and really puts toss on the back leg.

Even with multiple spines, and infestors defending, I am still losing almost all of my hatcheries!  Zealots ignore attacking units and focus the hatches/tech buildings, and if they fail to finish a building in one round they will keep being being warped in until the building is dead.  


There are 3 problems with the kind of harassment

1)  All the zealots and warp prisms only cost minerals so that easily makes it a cost effective strategy for the Protoss.

2) Hatcheries are too weak!  They don't have enough health to tank the zealot damage

3) This kind of harass requires very little micro investment for the Protoss player

**Early Game**:When I first went into this match, or even a DT rush, I got a quick gas, and evo chamber. I probably cut workers A LOT to make up for a big army that never ended showing up. 

* How can I differentiate between the different Protoss one base openers (4 gate, late Expo, etc) ?

* How should i adjust my build accordingly?

**Mid Game**: Once I realized that there was indeed no rush coming, there was a good chance he would be very agressive, and so I started to prepare for that. However, I didn't really get ready in time. His Zealot sentry army came right as my roaches were in production. I managed to snipe all of his sentries, and clean up a good portion of the zealots, but I still lost my base. Because of this, I feel I wasn't really able to get up the roach ling aggression I'm used to doing. Also my fourth was probably late. 

**Late Game** Now this is where I am confused as to why I lost. Despite all my struggles up to this point, I am able to slowly whittle down the protoss stalkers, and then just eventually overrun them. However, in this game, I wasn't really able to trade efficiently. I tried to harass the expos, but the mass cannons shut that down for the most part.

As a Zerg I find myself struggling with the following:

- I can never get to T3 fast enough

- I keep up with upgrades but I always end up engaging in poor areas

- I never seem to leave the right number of units + static d at base. It is either overkill or not enough and I end up losing a lot of stuff for free.

- I struggle with doing effective counter attacks. Whether it be brofestor hitsquads, I never seem to deal significant enough damage and always feel like I threw those units away for free.

- Late game my injects and tumors just die down. Hard. I feel pretty overwhelmed by the insane number of things I need to do.

As P:

- I always try to pressure the third too late in PvZ. My force usually gets crushed by some roach//speedlings. The games I win are only when the zerg has been cutting way too many corners for third//T2 tech.

- Similar problem as my Z where my T3 tech of choice is usually either on par with or behind my opponent's. 

- I always seem to lose sentries and have to replenish them.
                                                                                                                                                                                                   - In PvP I almost always lose if my opponent does 1 base 2 colo all in.

- In most of my games

TL;DR:

- I never really get a feel of when to pressure or when not to. I think this has a large effect on my above problems

- My macro does not allow me to pull off the sexy timings that I see people doing.

- Mid game kills me. I can be very comfortable in the opening portions but once mid-&gt;late game transition I completely fall apart.

- Throwing in multi-prong drops has been met with lots of success but I can't always rely on this alone as there are definitely people who can handle it and find other ways to punish me.

If somebody could point me to a free file hosting thing I would be more than happy to attach some replays to illustrate my above points. Thanks for reading!

 * They're relatively immobile and don't shoot up

Seeing mass roach is seeing a free when from the Terran perspective.  Just bio+tank push with a decent ball and it's a win.

What roaches are good for ZvT:

 * A few to get rid of early hellions and expand for a third

 * Supporting an all-in bust

To start

Now

Let's say you roll marines. Great. Easy to make, expand, and deny opponent expansions. So, you need to make enough barracks to keep your minerals low (easy on one base, tough on two or more). You do this by adding a barracks every now and then to ensure you're constantly building from everything. Also, add two engineering bays to get upgrades. So, you have to decide when to add barracks

You can also roll carriers. Uh oh. Tier 3 tech will result in a LOT of extra minerals. You know what only costs minerals? Nexuses and cannons. These are your mineral sinks. The point of carriers is to hold off on tech while you secure bases and feed your allies resources. You'll produce maybe two carriers at a time off of one base

So what's the point of all this? What's the end result?

You learn to expand and secure the expansions. You learn to get your upgrades going. You learn to make unit-producing buildings only when you need them.

1323116391.0,n1hx8,[D] Protoss over-gateway reactionary style,defektt,10,0,9,"**Preface:**  Before someone digs it up and tells me I have no business talking about strategy: I’m a diamond Protoss (Top diamond when I’m playing, and also recently switched to a new hotkey setup (my own version of grid).  Therefore
***      

**The Idea:**  A strategy for Protoss which involves overproducing gateways which could enable them to adopt the Zerglike ability to quickly switch from economic growth to military production.  This is something Day[9] has theorized about frequently
***       

**The Theory:** The name of the game in Starcraft 2 is to do everything you can to get ahead of your opponent economically while staying alive.  The longer you can hold off on creating an army, you don’t want to spend money on something unless it will immediately grant you something in return.  As an example, having an army that sits idle and doesn’t accomplish anything is a waste of resources.  Creating this standing army is something Protoss and Terran have traditionally done as a measure of safety. It’s difficult to produce a lot of units quickly with these races, so in order to be prepared for an eventual battle, a player will typically stockpile an army and produce out of all production structures constantly. Zerg don’t have to do this as often, however, because they are capable of switching gears extremely quickly.  There are two primary assets Zerg have that enable them to hold off on creating massive armies
 
•	The larva mechanic
 
•	Innate scouting / map control with creep spread and overlord vision.  This isn’t to say that either of these things is perfect – it’s quite easy for an opponent to deny overlords from an early stage, using units they have to make anyway (overlords for supply, and an inexpensive additional queen to start creep spread)
 
The proposed strategy utilizes Protoss tools to emulate the aforementioned Zerg characteristics.  These Protoss tools are:
 

•	The warpgate mechanic.  This allows Protoss to create a batch of units in just four seconds.  In addition
 
•	Space-controlling units.  The sentry and the high templar manipulate space very effectively.  This is important because controlling space and forcing an enemy to retreat or stay away buys a Protoss player time to warp in an army in a pinch.
*** 

**The Plan:**  The Protoss player should aim to spend the vast majority of their minerals on economic gain (nexii, while storms force an opponent to choose between temporary retreat and massive damage.  Both of these units buy a Protoss time to warp in a large gateway force.  Observers should also be scattered around the map to grant vision and advance warning of an incoming attack.  
*** 

**Advantages:**  The Protoss minimizes idle units.  The units which will be produced for defense, which is a return on investment.  Additionally, these units are very effective when used for drop harass; two HTs and two sentries can wipe out an entire mineral line in seconds if controlled well.  Observers are effective as scouts because they require detection to eliminate and they will spot invisible units well in advance (important because cloaked ghosts are a major bane of a sentry/HT heavy strategy).  The primary idle investments necessary are the excess gateways, but a gateway only costs about the same as one gateway unit, and grants much more than that in return.  Upon scouting an incoming enemy army, a gateway should be able to produce 2 units, maybe 3
 ***

**Weaknesses:**  Requires careful management and awareness.  In the early game, cloaked banshees, or baneling drops – basically anything that can assault your base without coming in the front door.  In the later game, an opponent may have massive units which render forcefields worthless as a defense.  If you look at this weakness by matchup, however, there are ways to control this risk.  Protoss massive units are archons and colossi; void rays are very good against both.  There may be a point in the game where it will become necessary to begin stockpiling void rays, as they’re generally good in this matchup anyway.  The same is true for PvZ; void rays are good against most zerg units (all but hydras, infestors)
 ***

**Summary:**  Protoss overproduces gateways, scatters observers for advance warning of incoming attack.  Upon an enemy moving out, Protoss stops economic production, warps in units as fast as possible, chronoboosting gateways.  Protoss stalls with sentries/templar while dropping on undefended bases.  This passive/reactionary style allows for faster-than-usual economic growth.  This strategy makes the Protoss weak against air harass, such as mutas, drops

Depending on time, but there I am usually crushed by the same Protoss opponent - who probably belongs a league or two higher, but anyway.

My usual approach is that I 1Rax FE in the open if it's a map that favours it, I respond with a number of bunkers, and afterwards try to play a straight bio macro game. Depending on mid-game P tech decision, I respond with the standard vikings or ghosts.

I am in need of help, I need someone more experienced to tell me what I should focus on more, or what it is that I'm doing wrong.

I've attached a couple of replays from various matches against the guy (Jalkloben) and against one of my Toss friends (Govinda).

I would appreciate any sort of support - whether I should focus more on SCVs, drops or any observations related to my play.

Hope someone can help!

**Update after awesome advice I got:**

I decided to play vs. my good Protoss training buddy

I'll post two replays - one in which I fail

* http://www.sc2replayed.com/replay-videos/15829
* http://www.sc2replayed.com/replay-videos/15830

In the first one, so I decide to get ghosts. In fact, he went colossi. After watching the replay and analysing my performance, I realised that there was a window in which I had a 40 supply lead, and even with the tech disadvantage, I should have been able to do significant damage.

Taking this knowledge, and noticed that I always have this window of opportunity, but I concluded that it may be so because of my opponent.

I would be very grateful if you could tell me whether I've adjusted correctly based on your advice.

I also have a question regarding the number of raxes - do I go for a specific number of raxes per base? What would you say is a right amount of raxes for 3 bases? How about 4 bases?

In the second replay I also go for double ebay

What are some good ways to secure a third base? This is most likely coming out of a forge FE. In PvZ taking a third recklessly can lead to a pretty easy denial by zerg or can leave the front of your natural vulnerable

I usually find that I need some substantial AOE damage before I can use my army to assert some control and take a third. My forcefield usage is far from perfect and I'm sure it's also situational

There's also the obvious things such as making a wall and cannons at your third. How often do you wall off your third completely? Only against counter-attack heavy styles

What maps do you consider the easiest/hardest to take a third on? Are there some where you would almost never consider taking a third? On a semi-related note, do you like to take the natural of the base across from you or the natural third (the one inside the cliff of the main base)? The natural across from you has the benefit of the ramp and having only one entrance (bar drops in its main). However, the natural third makes your base generally more compact and easy to defend with blink stalkers and colossi. Unfortunately, it also has many entrances.

Basically, you drop your infestation pit and spire (could go hydra den instead). Mass hosts and corruptors/mutas/hydras and march. Make sure you bring a few overseers to allow the hosts to detect stealthed units. 

I'd recommend going heavy with the static defenses while you macro up and try to bank as much gas as possible. I've had the most success with massing speedlings since you will be floating a lot of minerals. Of course you could opt for roaches but the idea is to bank as much gas as possible so you can mass your hosts along with whatever anti air unit you decide to go with. 

As for upgrades

Pretty much only use your lings and anti air as reinforcement in case your opponent pokes out in between locust spawns or tries to harass with air units(definitely use a group of lings to maintain map control while you're focused on your hosts). Other than that

Looking for critiques as well. I don't have a detailed order of the build on paper

This was a build that was sometimes used in SCBW

I was trying to brainstorm last night to see what other options you could go with to try and deal with this build

For context: Hero went for what looked to be an early 5/6 gate attack (can't remember exactly, Life went ahead and made about 10 drones, so if Hero had of gone for the push regardless I still think he would have been in a good spot.

I think the 3rd hatch *needs* to be punished somehow

* 4gate?
* 1 base blink stalker aka Nazgul blink stalker attack?
* Cannon up that third like a gaulzi boss?
* Take your third nexus super fast too?
* 2 base carriers? (only semi-trolling

1334520899.0,sb7sg,PvZ Skytoss build under development,NauticalInsanity,14,3,21,"Hi SC-strategy. I've been working on an air-based PvZ game and wanted to share some of my experience and prompt some discussion. [Here's](http://replayfu.com/download/6zmJwg) an example replay that encompasses much of the execution of this build. I've had an incredible winrate vs. zerg with it. The build revolves around keeping ahead on zerg with air upgrades while producing phoenixes

**Early Game**

I do a typical forge fast expand. A tight wall-off with buildings works here since you won't need to break anything down to attack. Your typical scouting and response for a forge fast expand apply here, send them across the map to check for incoming attacks and a third. 

**Mid Game**

Produce 3 void rays from your two stargates and start +1 air weapons. If you scouted a third from zerg with your three zealots, chill in your base until you have three phoenixes then send them out to scout around while leaving your void rays home to defend. No matter what in the first 10 minutes, do not lose any of your void rays. 

As your phoenixes are building, add on two more stargates. When +1 air weapons finishes, start +2. When your first two carriers finish, you can hit a nice timing attack with 3 voids, 2 carriers and 7+ phoenixes. Behind this take your third. Through the midgame add gateways, zealots, and cannons. 

**Late Game**

Take LOTS of bases. Gas is your biggest limiting factor, and hydras are incredibly weak to storm. If zerg has a lot of lings, keep your HTs in warp prisms and drop them to storm. A good rule of thumb also is 2 stargates for every base.

**Execution and responses**
I've found that the responses to zerg are counter-intuitive. Other than 2-base muta (lol) zerg trying to kill your army is the exact response you want and means you should be aggressive

* An ultra-fast 3rd: kill it if you can. If you fail

* Hydras: My favorite thing to see from zerg. Seriously. Focus mainly on making phoenixes and carriers. You should always have at least 10-15 phoenixes especially when zerg makes hydras. Try to engage them off creep. A-move with your slow air and spam graviton beam with your phoenixes and you will be amazed how quickly their hydra force melts.

* Corruptors: Less pathetic than hydralisks. Focus more on void ray production and take earlier bases. Because you started air attacks so early you should have an upgrade advantage on them and can trade pretty efficiently for a while. Phoenix range helps a bit against them as well. Ultimately you'll want high templar to help deal with the hydra-corruptor combination. Luckily

* Infestors: I haven't seen a lot of infestor responses to my build. I've mostly just gotten earlier observers

* Roach-ling: Seriously

* Mutalisks: Start phoenix range

It's not perfect yet. Minerals tend to pile up quickly and I don't have a good way to spend them. Zealots seem like the obvious answer, just like mech for terran. Also, it's likely that I win so much purely because zerg doesn't expect me to produce mass air.

1328855425.0,pj1xx,[Discussion] [Protoss] Genius's phoenix mutalisk defense build.,Nadril,9,1,16,"So I've been curious on what other protoss think of Genius's build. For reference he has used it against DRG and NesTea so far and beaten both of them.

For those who don't know the build it revolves around using Phoenix with +1 air weapons to deter mutalisks while taking a third base and pressuring the zerg. It's a super safe build with a ton of options available to the protoss. 

Now I've been trying it recently and my last game made me realize just how damn good this build is. With proper micro you can fend off a large ball of mutalisks. Even though I was just pumping out phoenix from 1 stargate I was able to micro and pick off mutalisks trying to get into my base.

What is nice about this is that the zerg cannot just go and attack probes without having his mutalisks ravaged. It means that every time the zerg enters your base he has to play a micro war against phoenix. 

Now obviously the downside is you need to micro well. However I honestly felt like microing my phoenix was much easier than trying to have blink stalkers and ht's with storm everywhere. The phoenix are *so* much more mobile and useful. 

Of course eventually you'll probably want to get blink and HT's anyways but you can hold off their harassment for an incredibly long time with phoenix. 

TL;DR: what do you guys think about Genius's +1 phoenix build against zerg who go mutalisks? Have any of you been using it on the ladder?

The build is ""inspired"" from CatZ Stream

I did alot of searching around to try and find the build, but failed, so I tried to make my own, with taking notes from CatZ game.


At the moment, although that was me just failing to scout, 1 or 2 spines could've stopped that with the help of the queens.


I play definisively with it and saturate my main and natural ASAP


My current build:

14 Gas

~~Off Gas at 350

14 Pool

~~Meta Boost when Pool Finishes

Expansion Hatch when determined with scout that it's safe

Evo Chamber after, +1 Carapace as soon as it Attack finishes.

Macro Hatch and queen shortly after stopping drone production.

Just before I attack, expand, and drop a roach warren and save larvae for now, then when I'm back to 100 gas start the lair.

Normally the attack is with about 80 Zerglings.


When I get to opp base: Send 1 ling in
Defensive Banelings: This is the hard counter, I expand and sit my lings outside the enemy base, preventing them from moving out for now and using them to contain while I expand, drone up my third and start +1 missiles and begin a tranisition into . Sometimes, if there's only a few banes, I would try to take them out with micros.


Roaches: If they aren't on the ramp, as the +1 Carapace means they need 3 shots to kill the Lings regardless, while continuing to rally in Zerglings and making a few drones inbetween to start saturating the third. If they're on the ramp, I take the natural and kill it if possible, as he will need to either move off the ramp, meaning I can kill them, or I can kill the natural, taking the Roaches means I will probably win


That's all I have atm

Im not a particular fan of doing mirror matches and so a couple weeks ago I decided to switch to terran as I hardly ever played against terran on ladder (70% zerg

To do this i demoted myself around the end of last season in order to try terran on diamond (i knew i wasnt ready to play in masters as terran).  It has been fun except for the fact that I CAN NOT beat protoss for the life of me.  Here are the stats of my 60 games I played as terran

http://i.imgur.com/YLGcX.png
(for those who cant open im 93% win rate against Zerg


Apparently there are protoss players in abundance in high diamond and they all pretty much walk over me.  

I can usually win if the game goes into a macro game using MMGM with vikings as necessary. Except I always seem to lose before i get to that point.

I usually lose to warp gate timing pushes (3 gate expo into 6 gate or 5 gate all in).  I have tried a variety of starts but dont seem to have consistent luck with any.  My usual opening is:

10 supply

12 rax

13 gas

2 marines then tech lab

21 CC

(after this i dont have the exact numbers down but i go)

-bunker at front as resources allow

-two more raxes

-another bunker

-facotry

What usually ends up happening is I'll scount the extra gateways and put down more bunkers but they just forcefield the bunkers so I cant repair and over-run me.


Since ive lose to that many time ill play safer and go for a 3 rax opening but when I do that the opponent always seems to go fast colossus and destroys me or 3 gate expands and holds with sentries and then im far behind because I didnt expand.

Depending on the map ill open two rax (one with TL) and put fast MM with CS pressure till warpgates finishes.

Ive also tried adding tanks to the mix

Most of my wins have come from cheesey tactics that would probably not do any good if scouted (3 rax reaper opening

-Is 1 rax expo too gready? 

-If I two rax or 3 rax will I be too far behind if they 1 gateway expand or 3 gate expand?

-How many bunkers do I need to hold this kind of pressure?

-Are there any tells to look for so I can know forsure this is comming? (ie

As I watched TvZ in the GSL this season
  
Imagine you're playing a ZvT on Daybreak. As Zerg, it provides a huge movement speed bonus to all of your units. The implications of this speed bonus can not be overstated. First of all, if Terran sieges you up on the creep, your units will all close the distance faster against the Terran ranged units and thus do significantly more damage. Furthermore, you can run for a counter-attack or a surround around a flank if you have creeped two adjacent lanes.  
  
Now, you will be able to clear up 2 scan radiuses of creep, which is a huge deal and could give you 5 extra seconds of time before the baneling flank or counterattack comes in.  
  
This doesn't just apply to TvZ or ZvT though. In PvZ we often see a MSC/obs or voidray/obs combination taking out creep tumors. While you don't see Zergs doing as much ling-centric play in ZvP, you can't really retreat without creep, and since you play swarm-hosts sort of like Terran mech, you do NOT want to be losing your very expensive army so retreating is crucial.  
  
For ZvZ, creep gives vision and a defensive advantage, as well as a faster rally, so it's definitely useful.  
  
Overall, it's more situational and less universally awesome.    
  
In terms of how to mechanically and strategically do this, then one goes to my third later on. In the other matchups, I usually only make a 3rd Queen as creep is slightly less valuable.  
  
FOr spreading them
  
An advanced technique: you can hotkey your tumors as something like ""0"" which most people don't use
  
I hope this helps newer players understand why they should focus on spreading or denying creep.

TvT is just a experience plate. The more you play it

TvP, and even 3 gate harass after a quick expand, Protoss just keeps on getting to death ball and I die.

Something I thought of

1 rax, and make a ton of marines. Then get factory ASAP and then a starport for 4 medivacs. When you have started factory, switch from marines to marauder production. Once you have 4 medivacs, take all of your guys, and all of your workers from your natural and push out.

That works

2. What build do you guys do against TvP?

I went for a +1 Speedling expand/push that ended up getting delayed and killed by my opponent's 8-Pool into a 1-base Roach all-in.  From that point on

A few questions:

1) When I scout my opponent's 8-pool

2) After holding his 8-pool, I assumed he was trying to hide a tech-switch into Mutas (which came later) so I took my third, threw down a Roach Warren, teched to Lair, AND started researching +1 ranged attack, and much to my surprise he came at me with 23 Roaches.  What research/buildings should I have canceled/what should I have done to hold my natural expansion and maintain my economic lead?

IMO I should have cancelled +1 Range, and made a ton of Speedlings, as I *think* with +1 attack I might have been able to clean up the Roaches.  I had more than enough Larva due to my fairly early Macro-Hatch, I just didn't have the minerals to afford any units with that Larva.  Does that sound right?

1348671717.0,10ibwk,ZvP: My thoughts on the current metagame,IsomerSC,16,9,16,"Hey All
  
People liked my ZvT thoughts yesterday
  
**Early Game: Zerg Perspective**  
In the early game, so don't take the 15 H."" I actually don't like this line of thinking at all because of two things: Protoss are increasingly going Nexus first AND defending cannon rushes isn't that bad. Use your 2nd ovie over your 15h and you can see if he's trying anything, then just pull drones. If you can snipe the probe before he puts down a cannon, you have a significant lead because he slowed his nexus by placing a pylon. You can also send like 3 drones to attack the probe and then put 3 or 4 drones on patrol in the ""best"" cannon locations, so he can not use them.  
  
Anyway, some wait to 35, its personal preference and not a huge deal IMO). You will drone until 6 minutes, then take two gasses, and at 7 minutes get the roach warren and evo chamber. First 100 gas to speed, and if you scout gas at the natural you can go instant Lair and +1 upgrade, but if he doesn't have gas by 7 minutes he is probably trying some sort of gateway timing so save gas for some roaches. I will talk about later 2 base allins in the midgame section
  
**Early Game: Protoss Perspective**  
The main question for Protosses is what kind of expand build to do. Many like Seed, so if you want to try those out go check out their PvZ. The overwhelmingly popular choice in PvZ is the forge fast expand because it allows you to go worker-for-worker with Zerg until 40 or even 45 harvesters if you chronoboost well.  
  
The question of Nexus first vs. Forge first is a stylistic choice. If you want to be able to cannon rush his 15 hatchery or to be more safe against early pools, so for that reason pros are favoring it on most maps.  
  
About wallins: Use a gateway, you should start with 1 and add more if you scout anything that smells of aggression (no drones at 3rd, no 3rd, your first zealot takes tower and scouts units coming in, etc.) With respect to build orders, you can do Nexus-Forge-Gateway all on 17, or you can do 13 forge 17 Nexus 17 cannon 18 gateway. The choice of build order is map and opponent specific, but against Moon or DRG (more likely to cheese) I would be more likely to forge first. 
  
Once you have taken your natural, or allin Zerg? If he is not taking his 3rd, you should not either because he is probably going muta or infestor or some wonky allin like Nydus hydra or drops. You need to get a probe or obs into his base to see what he is doing. Muta-ling you need to get storm, archons, blink, and attack upgrades. Ling-infestor you can use HT if you want to, but I would say colossus is much better against ling-infestor play.  
  
But, which is right before most zergs get roaches and thus you can try to take down the third. There is also the 6 gate which cuts probes at 32, but if you get scouted you are boned. There are later pushes like the 7gate +2 blink stalker, the same play but with an obs (safer but slower), voidray zealot (1 stargate voidray, 4-5 gateways zealots), and so on.  
  
Let's talk about the immortal sentry all-in briefly. This deserves its own paragraph because it can come in many different shapes and sizes. Does he get a warp prism? Does he go with 2-3 immortals or does he wait for 4-5? Does he ""take"" a third to lull you into security then just go? Does he get less sentries/immortals and go for blink on top of a couple of immortals/sentries? Really, at which point you can continue to allin or take your own third and go up to colossus. 
  
**Midgame: Zerg Perspective**
The great thing about these sentry allins, see the lack of a third, high sentry count, immortals being chrono'd, and realize: he is doing this allin.  
  
You must not tech anymore and make only units when you identify this (or any) allin. Make lings first and roaches second. Why? Because with lings you can delay his push. One thing Protosses might do by mistake is let their army split up as it moves out, you just need to come with roach-ling from both sides at his army. Try to catch it when it is out in the open, not on a ramp where it can be tucked into a pocket. EZPZ  
  
After all of the 2 base shit is defended, go double evo, get infestor tech (or muta, if you want), and take your fourth. Defending an all-in allows you to tech and expand, but don't autopilot because every Zerg has been killed by follow-up allins after playing too greedily.  
  
One cute play you can use is to take his 3rd while he is backing off from an allin, for instance if you barely hold the allin it'd be better to take your fourth with that money. If you smash the allin, then you could try this or something else equally fun. 
  

Your goal in the midgame is mostly just to get to Greater Spire and 5 bases. The more infestors, the better off your late game will be. You can try roach-ling attacks into his natural/3rd at the same time, see if you can get a cancel or kill some probes or sentries, but keep in mind the main goal of the midgame should not be to kill him. Like I said, the main goal of the midgame is to set up a sick lategame.  
  
**Midgame: Protoss Perspective**  
The midgame for you will basically hinge upon whether or not you get up your third safely. With 3 bases you can make a deathball, split your sentry/immortal up a bit to help against multipronged aggression, but make sure you are watching the minimap like a hawk if you see he doesn't have a fourth. If you can get an obs onto his rally point or his army, that will be really great for your safety.  
  
Generally I would say the tech route for the midgame depends upon your opener. If you went blink stalkers, so keep that in mind when you play your mid-game and watch for his Hive timing.  
  
The midgame generally belongs to the Zerg, but most will have some amount of roach-ling and will be pinning you back until you can get up the AoE to deal with it. For that reason, I would not recommend using warp prisms until you have some map presence, because Zerg is going to see the warp prisms a lot better and is going to not feel pressure from your main army.  
  
The better time to use warp prisms will be in the late game, so might as well warp them into his base.  
  
**Late Game: Zerg Perspective**  
Basically, so that you can burn his vortex on his own units. Other than that, really just get infestor-broodlord-spine crawler as your composition. Get 5 or 6 bases if you can, and don't hesitate to make 100 spine crawlers. I'm serious: I've seen pros make obscene numbers of spines, so just get like 3 per base and a bunch at the front. Also, watch out for DT harassment, get an overseer at each base if you know he has the dark shrine.  
  
Spread creep everywhere, and you should be good. The late game is really the ""simplest"" phase of ZvP, IMO.  
  
**Late Game: Protoss Perspective**  
You are doing warp prism harass, that will help you to win, but keep in mind vortexing a ton of corruptors/infestors or doing a double vortex are also good. I don't know much about the carrier transition, but I have seen Seed go for like 6-7 stargate carriers. Stooben in the comments mentions you should only go carriers if you are very ahead, otherwise just add gates and robos. If you do go carrier, Make sure you get storm and lots of HT if you do this style because corruptors and infestors will ruin your day without HT. Also, feel free to make mass cannons, because you will have a ton of minerals anyways.

Just looking for general feedback as this match seems to epitomize my typical loss in ZvP. I went with the 12 minute max. I managed to get my natural down without being blocked.

By getting Dark Templar onto the field, and so your opponent needs a Robotics Facility if they plan to take their Natural, or leave their base at all. A Roboics Facility and an Observer costs 175 Vespene. A player with a Robo really needs two Observers however in order to move out of their base (detection in base and on army), raising the total cost in vespene to 250 Vespene for detection alone. This is the cost of your Dark Shrine!

If a player already planned on getting a Robotics Facility


Overview
It’s been a while since I last released a guide! I’m so sorry, I’d like to share this idea with the community in hopes people can try out some interesting PvP strategies based off of this post.

I stole the idea for this type of play from iSTime one day on ladder. So I meet him on ladder and start asking about MLG, he killed me with a single really fast Archon (from DT tech), and a slew of chargelots!

And so I stole the idea. DT into Chargelot Archon. I’ve played this style against some of the highest NA players (GoSuGatored

GomJabbar wrote:
DTs force (and are weakest against) robo tech. Chargelots and archons are quite good against robo tech in the early and mid game. So it’s a pretty effective transition.

Choose your Opening
As I do with most of my threads lately, it can be done in many different ways. I’ve done 1 Gate FE, 2 Gate 3 Stalker -&gt; FE, 3 Stalker -&gt; 1 base, etc.

I recommend going with a 3 Stalker opening


Mid-Game
I define mid-game as the portion of time after the 6 minute mark when any 4 Gate attempt is either tried or feigned. As this time passes, then immediately place your Dark Shrine. Your opponent isn’t going to attack you at this point, unless you let them realize something is off or they are just plain bad.

Take this time to get out your DT tech. This is also the time to be researching Charge (while Dark Shrine is constructing)

Once your first Archon is constructed you can try to bust your opponent’s ramp. The best thing to stop this timing attack is just a Pylon + 2 Gateways on your opponents ramp. If these buildings are there

If he has a Robotics facility, as it can be really difficult to get an Archon to run over a FF when Chargelots are swarming around.

Often times on close positions mid game, where I was down from the early game about 700 resources, and still won a battle due to a smart DT in a mineral line and proper engagement.

A Chargelot/Archon composition in the mid-game will also auto-win against any Stargate opening. I have a replay that exemplifies this against some GM protoss on I believe Xel’Naga Caverns.

I almost every game will transition into an expansion + Blink followed by a Robotics Facility. You can usually take a very fast expansion after the first Archon due to an ability to win battles with cost-efficiency in an open engagement.

Nexus Timing
When exactly do you expand? You can place your Nexus in trade of 4 Zealots at any point in time. This can be when your Dark Shrine is constructing and your Stalkers are mid-field. I do this pretty often, your fake 4 Gate actually set your opponent’s build off and he made mistakes, your opponent simply doesn’t move until he has an Observer out (which means your first DT should wreak havoc!).

Often times I place my Nexus after I realize I can’t bust the ramp and kill my opponent. It’s usually pretty clear as to whether or not I can bust up the ramp. If he has his army on the top of the ramp and has a few Sentries, you can probably win with a timing attack.

So to reiterate

Weak Spots
There is definitely a weak spot in this style, and have a very good chance that your opponent won’t know what’s going on with your Zealot stockpile until it’s all too late.

Trying to bust the ramp at different times with Archons has lead to quite a few losses on my end. You can definitely do it, or do it really well. You have to have your Archon bust the FF’s, you have to spread your Zealots against Colossi splash, you have to prevent your opponent from abusing your Zealots’ short range. Just know that it’s much easier to wait for your opponent to move down their ramp and engage mid-map, than to aggressively walk up their ramp.

I was playing with the Evolution Chamber script for Zerg builds and my idea was to find a way to put early pressure onto an opponent that would hopefully cause him to build defenses and panic a little. While he is building army and bunkers/cannons/spines and is expecting more lings or banelings

The build goes like this:

* 8  SpawningPool
* 8  Extractor
* 10  Overlord
* 10  Zergling x3

Push with lings and try to cause economic damage without losing any. If they wall in just contain and push their ramp every 15 seconds or so to remind them that you are there. Lings also serve as the scouts

* 15  Queen
* 18  Overlord
* 18  RoachWarren
* 18  EvolutionChamber
* Get 3 drones in gas
* 18  Extractor number 2
* 24  Overlord
* 24  Carapace
* 24  Roach x1
* 26  Overlord
* 27  Roach x1
* 29  Overlord
* MOVE DRONE TO EXPO
* 29  Hatchery
* 28  Roach x4
* 36  Queen 
* 38  Roach x1
* Get 2 more drones in gas
* 40 Overlord
* 40 Roach x5
* Fill gas
* Push
* Extractor's 3 and 4 when you see fit.

Depending on how the push goes

You have to be aware of invisible units or Air

**Zerg:**


The swarm host seems really... tricky. I think tank armies will really hate this one. Could work like a lurker

The vipers ""grant detection"" line makes me think it can make certain units see invisible units, so the viper can pull in anything of the enemies and disable its attack. Maybe changelings also trigger the cancelling effect? Oh and it has a meathook ability too. Not sure I see that as being too important, unless it is aoe (the text is unclear about that).


**Terran:**


Warhound seems like a thor replacement - the thors always been pretty boring and its activated ability has bounced between overpowered and useless since launch. A smaller unit is also automatically less abusable with repair

Battle Hellion: Hellion was too hard to prevent damage from
Shredder: If it didn't say it is a unit, it would have to do something more than just detect.

**Protoss:**

Replicator: wtf. I have a hard time seeing how this either wont be infinitely abusable or completely useless. Maybe it will just be powerful but then also a must for Protoss?

**General Overview:** The build opens with either 2gate 1forge, the extra zealot arrives to block the zerglings from killing the pylon or cannon.  If opening 1gate 1forge 1gate, the cannon might get denied, but it will force lings and delay the expansion.  Once this opening phase is complete, you fast expand, and transition into a blink stalker timing, I believe with +2.

**How it feels as Zerg:** The opening pylon-cannon doesn't always get up, I go into super drone mode, but even then the protoss is barely behind on workers.  The blink stalker push is incredibly powerful if you aren't prepared for it, and even knowing it's coming, it's very hard to deny.  The only time I successfully held it off was with Roach/Hydra, but the followup colossus transition killed me.

**Attempted Responses:** I tried a number of different builds.  I have traditionally gone ling/festor in the early to midgame in ZvP, and even with spines, was able to do enough damage to kill me.  I tried going for an immediate roach counter-attack after getting my natural secured, but this also got mopped up by the stalkers without doing enough damage.  I tried a fast roach/hydra, which held off the blink stalkers, but left me behind in econ and the colossus followup killed me.  I tried ling/baneling, but I didn't actually get to see it against the blink stalkers

**Things I didn't try:** I didn't try fast mutas

My thought process is either they're 4 gating in which case we'll have micro wars and I don't need to gas steal

I feel like the natural response to having your gas stolen is going 4 gate yourself but some low master/high diamond folks seem to instead just go along with their build anyways and my 4 gate stomps them. I included a replay of this happening-- I think he's doing Day9's early immortal thing but he can't keep a good sentry count without 2 gas and I break his ramp. 

My question is: what do I do when they do the natural thing and go defensive 4 gate? Is it just micro wars still or does a defensive 4 gate after a gas steal have an advantage? Should I even be gas stealing while 4 gating? I have to cut my zealot ( I think) in order to have a properly timed 4 gate with a gas steal

For starters

Solution: Spread mutalisks just like we already spread them against thors. Even with such a short range we can still cluster a fair amount of mutas together to attack a target without clumping to the point of losing everything.

Hydralisks would be the next problem, and always take 3 hits to kill a zergling (at equal upgrades). In short, hydralisks are bad (but the only dedicated GtA we have...).

Roaches would be a problem as a roach timing attack would be difficult to hold without roaches of your own

1311983442.0,j3pku,My 2cents on Terran Matchups (mostly mech),noojoh,10,2,5,"**My analysis of Mech Play against all matchups in SC2**

*So I’m writing this as I am currently bored at work and have been meaning to do so for some time. I am a Master League Terran who has recently been playing a lot less SC2 but has been around since day one of the beta. At my peak

**AGAINST PROTOSS:**

*Mech is amazing in this matchup once it gets started. Tanks melt stalkers and help against colossi
 
*The mindset against Protoss as Mech Terran is to match Toss expansions and get pretty quick upgrades to fight well in the late game. This however does not mean to just let toss get what he wants and as many bases as he wants as toss is pretty unstoppable late-game with the number of units that can be produced by warp gates. Instead, you then go for a counter-attack with your mech units or advance your position to deny reinforcements to a toss expo which you can then deny with blue flame hellions. 

*Common Builds: I always go for a wall at my choke because of the annoyingly effective builds that toss has. I then go for a factory after rax and make a siege tank while producing rines in order to combat most openings. Usually the zealot and stalker that toss tends to send to my base gets there when I have ~5 rines and my tank is about to finish. Depending on what I see in the toss base
*(One trick that is useful in “guessing” what the toss will do is sending an scv scout to see what type of units the toss has. Generally, a void ray or sometimes a DT comes only to turn away because of turrets.)
*After securing my second base and the two extra gases, I go for a fast timing push. 
*My favorite timing push with two bases is either [1 tech lab factories + 3 reactor factories to pump out hellions in a staggering amount] or [2 tech lab factories + 2 reactor factories to have a higher tank count]. The latter is a bit of a slower push but is less risky as you can transition back and try to turtle your way back into the game when your push fails. The former is a very fast push which usually hits when the first colossus comes out and allows you to set up a contain, hellions can melt zealots, act as meat shields for tanks against stalkers, and most importantly, decimate probe counts. 
*However, I generally make some ghosts as well even though, as I explained before, hellions help tremendously against immortals. If the push happens later or the toss rushed to colossi, I have one reactored starport making Vikings as well. The beauty of mech is that your tanks generally don’t die and do heavy far range dps and the 3-4 reactored factories you have constantly replenish hellion (meat shield) numbers. Also because of how fast hellions move, you can send a few to the toss expansions to erase probes. 
*If you get to the very late game, even I find it hard to beat the toss player after holding more of the map and resources. 
*Mech against toss has a bunch of vulnerable-timings but once you get hellion production going and an even number of bases


**AGAINST TERRAN:**

*The mindset in mech TvT is to draw lines in the map to ‘hold’ with tanks so that you can expand and deny enemy expansions. Although I am only in Masters

*Back in the beta people used to do almost pure Tank Viking. People started to experiment however because a lot believed that TV was too immobile and in some cases, I have still found success in usually primarily tanks and less Vikings. The reason is that as long as you can hold the positions, tanks still kill basically anything on ground, and Vikings kill anything in the air. Air dominance in a Viking/tank fight or even playing against marine/tank/Viking is important so I generally go for faster air upgrades than ground as once you lose your Viking count, it is hard to catch up again and your opponent can hold more ground/advance towards you.

*Another good unit composition is tank hellion as long as he has a low tank count and high marine count. Hellions are even faster than marines and when position-microed right

*Build/ Openers: Generally I use the same opener I use in toss with the siege expand and all but I either get a fast starport after or if I sense that he’s getting banshees, I have such a huge eco advantage that I know I’ve won the game. You have to be careful of blue-flame hellion drops however. They come later than banshees but with the siege expand, you may only have a couple of tanks by the time it gets there. What I like to do is make a bit more turrets and have a tank seiged close to each CC. Even then I lose some SCVs but because of 2 Orbital CCs, unless I lose a substantial amount, I can kill his dropped hellions and bring myself back to a higher economic state faster with mules.

Upgrades. This is largely directed at zerg and protoss who are facing a terran opponent. You should absolutely expect that when a terran pushes out (especially if it's the typical 10 minute timing or beyond) that he will AT LEAST have stim

Timing. Do not let your opponent sit unharassed for 20 minutes straight unless you plan on getting steam rolled. I see this a lot with toss who think their ""death ball"" will protect them from all evil. At least camp his base with a few units

Tonight I had a toss hole up on two bases for 22 minutes while I casually picked up 4 bases and maxed out on ghosts vikings and marauders. He let me drop his base twice before adding any static defense and then complained that terran was a click to win race. I normally get destroyed by late games toss especially if they antagonize me throughout the game. The game is more or less balanced

Last thought is on expanding. Yesterday I talked about adding production, if you're running a 10 minute timing push, you should expand as you push out. If my opponent hasn't expanded to 3 by the 12-14 minute mark, I know that I have around a 90% chance of winning. You need to keep up economically. 

So

Good night all and glhf out there.

This is what happens most games.

It has been mentioned in other threads that Terran should have the ability to drop in Barracks units like they can in the campaign

Protoss and Zerg have strong methods of reinforcing their armies as well as responding to attacks on their bases while the army is away. Protoss has warp gates and chrono boost while Zerg has creep combined with the immense production power of inject larva. Terran, as the only real method for boosting their army production speed is through reactors. The thing about inject larva and chrono boost is that these both can increase economy as well as army production, while the only similar ability that Terran has is MULEs. I am not saying that this isn't fair on the economy side, as MULEs are widely regarded as fucking amazing, but reactors simply don't cut it when it comes to army. With creep, Zergs can pump most of their units quickly into the fray, excluding slower units such as Infestors. Protoss can immediately enhance their army in the field through proxy pylons. Terran units are stuck with the only option being a steady and slow trot into the fray and by the time they reach the army

My first concern was that drop pods would break the game. The idea of dropping units from the sky onto opponents is pretty worrisome when it comes to balance. I have a few fixes to this. First off, a Starport+Tech Lab research, or an entirely separate building (or possibly Ghost Academy research) that once again requires Starport. This places it late enough where the only way to get it early is to make some serious sacrifices. Secondly, scanning and dropping has to be out of the question. Simply disabling drop pods where a scan is present amends this issue. Thirdly, the drop pod cannot simply function like warp gate. The purpose of drop pods is threefold; Reinforce, Defend and Recover. Either bolster the army, defend a drop/nydus, I would think that making a separate building that launches the drop pods would be the best way to deal with this. On a very long cooldown

1350836466.0,11ujkg,New TvP Build? - FE into hellion marauder combo,Dynge,12,7,12,"So i really like the hellion

So this is a basic 10 minute timing, so its obvioulsy not perfected, but i really like the idea. It gives you map vision with the hellions in early game and sets you up for a strong midgame.

The idea with going hellions instead of marines is that the marines are mainly there so kill the zealots in the protoss army. Since marauders does a much better job killing the other protoss units. So instead of marines i use hellions in this. They do splash aswell meaning theyll do a lot of damage.

This build requires some micro to be perfect. I didnt execute it like i wanted

So thoughts?

Replay of me executing it: http://drop.sc/266642

So this is a rough build order (one i wrote for myself to remember the build :D)

1 Rax FE first then:

@100min - Bunker at front

@75min - Gas

@CC nat done Orbital (BEFORE BARRACKS)

@300min - Barracks x2

@100gas - Factory

@50gas - Reactor (switch to factory)

@Fact 50% - Gas (2)

@25gas - Tech Lab (only marines 'till stim)

@100gas - Upgrade Stim

@25gas - Tech Lab

PUMP OUT UNITS!

@Stim 50% - Conc Shells

@400 min - CC (3)

Move out and poke

YOU LOSE ARMY

My thoughts are that you are expanding in the direction you are pushing. The push from your third to their third is made easier by this forward base, which DeMusliM isn't doing, you would see anything coming and could react) You have high ground advantage rather than low ground disadvantage....

It might be easier to pull you apart with a fast ling muta force though. I'm not sure. In the game on stream he loses his natural to a ling bling muta force but sits at the top of his ramp till he has enough to push out again.

Game 1. TvP. Shakuras http://drop.sc/88901

Scouting- I saw 1 Gate, and high energy on his Nexus. Is this too early for 2 gas? I considered this pretty standard, assuming he would chrono out warp tech and then go into 3 gate robo or 4 gate. I got my SCV out before 4:20 which I think is about the time a Stalker pops out.

The bunker on my ramp was unnecessary

10 minutes- I didnt mean to get a tank

16 min- My drop got scouted by his proxy pylon and easily shut it down (I could have handled it better too)

20 min- First big engagement

I also had idle SCVs in my main at the end. Somehow I failed to notice this...sorry.

Overall

Game 2. TvZ. Antiga http://drop.sc/89000

Okay

6 minutes- his scouting lings picked off an SCV

I think I should have put down a factory sooner for faster tanks and medivacs

I totally missed his early expo in the 6 o'clock. No excuses there.

12 min- pretty terrible engagement on my part. I dont know why I didnt split my bio for the banelings

16 min- I have no clue why I went to engage

Stayed on 2 base for WAY too long. When Zergs go muta

I also didnt add on Barrack for a rediculously long time

22 min engagement- thought I handled this relatively well. Feedback please.

23 min engagement- pretty awful on my part.

31 minutes- I got up his ramp into his natural

Overall I played pretty shitty in this game. I think not expanding and not adding on rax really killed me. I did decently with upgrades, I think if they Zerg was of a higher caliber he could have expanded way more aggressively and would have absolutely crushed me.

I've known about this build for a while now and have just recently begun using it again. I find that recently every zerg and their mother is going for all sort of crazy all-in's (and if not that

I've played 4 matches with this build since I started to use it again. Won 3

I find myself really enjoying this build for a few reasons. The first is that it is pretty easy to fend off mutalisks early on. phoenix + mothership (mothership hits at around the time 2 base phoenix would) means that the mutas just get wrecked if they try to attack. If they decide to go mass muta than vortex + archons demolish them. 

The second reason is that it sets you up perfectly for that late game composition you so badly want in PvZ. The fact is the mothership is quickly becoming a must have in late game PvZ. Mothership/archon is one of the few ways you can realistically deal with brood lords and the build crushes a lot of other common unit compositions as well.

Finally I like that it is not dependent on a forge FE and is still a quite economical build. 

The biggest problem you run into is muta/ling/bling. This just requires you use your vortex defensively a lot of times rather than try a toilet

So has anyone else used this build before? For those who are having troubles with the match up or who are simply tired of having to go 2 base timings you should check the build out.

1316430983.0,kkdp0,One basing in TvP video examples and discussion,michaelgasser17,9,1,3,"I have a previous submission that discusses using SCVs to tank vs protoss as a terran player.  This strategy (I've been trying to submit a link for this but it hasn't shown up on reddit) involves a 10-12 min push off of one base that includes 14-16 SCVs, and the rest marines.  You can use siege tanks instead of banshees and their purpose is the same in that they target fire sentries to prevent GS and force fields.  In the video below you will see it dominate the piss out of the toss I'm playing.  I play in the platinum league and I'm like 95% vs toss with this.  The only things that I lose to are DTs and sometimes an early stalker push with one void ray.

I have continued to refine this strategy and tighten the timings.  The push in the video below is late.  I almost never push after 11 mins with this now.

The reason why that timing exists is it is before colossus is out for most.  The critical mass of 3 colossus is what makes terran infantry useless and you have to kill him with this prior to that.  Also psi storm owns this so you can't go late.

Pros:

* You have multiple scouts available if the overseer dies
* (Not directly related to scouting) Stray Overlords can get away better if the opponent tries to attack them.
* (Not directly related to scouting) OLs can be used more effectively for the creep highway.

Cons:

* OL speed research is more expensive
* Lack of contaminate/ changeling
* Slower to research than making an overseer (can't remember if this is fact)

PvZ - Usually a FFE.  My probe usually scouts the pool/hatch timing.  I actually do a pylon+2 canon behind their natural or block their natural with a pylon if I have the resources and depending on what he puts down first.  After the first probe I usually make a couple of zealots and push them across to see if he's taken a 3rd, same with mutas or hydras.

PvT - I'm still in the stone age and don't do a gateway FE.  I need to work on my Terran but right now I do a fast gas for moco, first probe can usually see if he's going 3 rax or 1/1/1.  After the initial scout with the probe I'll send over the moco to poke the front and see what guys he has made and if I can maybe see other buildings but usually only see marines and the front wall.  Any timed marks I should try and scout over there to see what he's building?  Help if I know he's going tanks, mines, air?

PvP - Hate this match up so much.  I usually go 3 gate robo or 4 gate still and have been losing to VR's a lot lately so that needs to be changed.  I kind of know the timings for toss since I play them the most.  I just hate this match up.

Off the top of my head

TvP- You can use starport #2 on a reactor to be able to always stay ahead of the colossus count, although Templar and Stalkers are pretty good against that. If you can keep your Starport on a tech lab, you'll also have a Raven against to help snipe Observers.

TvZ: Again on the reactor, your Zerg oppponent can make 5-6 queens like DRG did and you end up with creep at your front door in record time. Having a Raven would save so much money in scans to clear out all of the creep spread. I also feel like Ravens are somewhat underrated against Zerg air units as they tend to end up clumped (especially Corruptors and Mutas). Seeker missile does quite a bit of damage, and if you catch the Zerg player without his units split, it can even be a GG scenario. You can also keep Banshees out by having your Starport on the tech lab to try and deny Zerg's 4th/5th bases.

 Midgame contains with seigetanks coupled with multiple drops are becoming an issue for me, but now, players use a lot of 3/3 marines (split, meaning its a pain to fungal) have plenty of upgraded thors and vikings.

1335454056.0,stnyu,[Q] Parting's PvT?,kengou,6,2,6,"Hey all

I remember Parting for a few PvZ games he dominated a few months ago

It seems to me like he goes for the greediest FE he can get away with given his scouting, which transitions into a contain while he mass expands and techs up.  Looks strong but I used to try stuff like that and it was hit and miss (and pretty all-in).  In the GSL, I've seen him do a really fast 3rd base at 6-7 minute mark much more often, where he masses gates and gets charge and archons and makes a ton of use out of sentries in the midgame.  Then he just defends 2-base Terran and keeps preventing a 3rd base, while expanding more.  Looks brilliant, but I'm sure there's lots of weaknesses.  Finally, I see him sometimes get a robo before his 3rd base or his timing attack, sometimes he gets a cannon at his natural or a fast forge - what's up with that?  And the first game vs Polt

Anyone know about more details to this build? What are the scouting triggers for his divergence in the build? (when does he do the timing attack vs fast 3rd? When does he get his robo and what does he use it for in different circumstances?  What does he do vs mech stuff, etc?)

Also what are some good vods to study up on this build/style?

1334977528.0,skse7,Need some help playing zerg,x2Infinity,9,2,14,"Was just wondering if I could get some help with my play in any match up. I have about 7 replays which I think are about average games I play. I'm gold btw.

In ZvT I typically have 2 problems. Either I can't take a third base because of hellions and marines or late game ZvT I find myself running out of bases with minerals and having to expand closer to terran. I'm guessing this is because I'm not getting more efficient units like brood lords out. However I find that the games that I have tried getting brood lords I've had a lot of problems with drops because of how slow they are or I find loads of minerals but not enough gas to get a lot of them.

ZvP I've mostly had trouble right after I take a third base I get pushed by toss with a lot of units and can never hold my third with Roach/Infestor. Other problems I have are dealing with stargate plays in FFE with them killing off my overlords and queens until I can get infestors out to deal with them better.

ZvZ I just have a hard time telling when to make a baneling nest

In retrospect, and my partner would definitely die.

This happened a few days ago, as I've only run into this strategy once, but it really pissed me off that a couple of douchebags could BM all they want and win with what's arguably the second most basic strategy in the game (the first being worker rushing), especially considering that they didn't even have the element of surprise.

I am very much a creature of habit, hoping it would sink in.  It was flexible depending on the situation, but in general it was something like this: 1.) main army 2.) important depots to raise/lower 3.) vikings, hellions, or other random unit subset 4.) CCs 5.) tanks, ghosts or other random unit subset 6.) factories 7.) rax 8.) blank (used to be second set of rax before I realized you could make marines and marauders with one hotkey without tabbing) 9.) reactor starports 0.) tech lab starports (again, didnt realize that I could do this without tabbing).

It was less than ideal, I wanted to have split marines and more extensive subsets of units, and I was running out of number keys to use (what if I'm facing bling/muta/blord and need 3 or 4 hotkeys for all my unit types?)  The conclusion I reached was that I needed to consolidate my unit producing structures.

I had the same worry everyone else does when they switch hotkeys: ""What if it gets worse before it gets better?  What if I blow my ladder ranking while I adjust?""  But I pushed that aside, I felt like I was focused just on hotkeys, and it was frustrating.  However....it got better.  Lots better.  The new scheme keeps the main army on 1 and the CCs on 4, but everything else is changed.  For ease of reach I mostly phased out 7-0 except in cases of drops and other random subsets you don't attend to much (I haven't had as much occasion for these yet).  2 and 3 are my unit subsets like tanks, hellions, vikings etc. (with higher numbers always available in matchups where I use more unit types) but 5 and 6 saw the most radical changes.  5 is all non-CC unit producing structures, and 6 is all upgrade buildings.  

The big muscle memory adjustment was creating new ""pathways"" (neurologically speaking) for tabbing to different structures.  It took some time

Again, at least this individual player found it helpful to experiment with something more efficient.  Mostly I was just excited and wanted to share.

How do I tell *what* the zerg is going to do with their spire? Several times now I have scouted an early spire, get +1 air, ect. Typical ""muta counters"".

Then I get hit by some sort of mass roach timing or a lot of roach/corruptor. (Or in this recent game roach/hydra/corruptor). Even if I hold it off I am on the back foot all game and never really get to recover.

So anyways, feel like a coin flip. It's not that I have a problem with mutas or *any* kind of zerg composition... it's that I have a problem knowing *which* composition it is going to be.

The biggest issue I have is that I cannot just ""wait"" until I see mutas. If I see mutas and I am not prepared it's an instant loss. However if I prepare and mutalisks don't come than it is also almost an instant loss for me.

Do I just try and do a different mutalisk counter other than genius's +1 build? I'm not really sure. Phoenix are what I am the most comfortable with vs. Mutalisk but I essentially need to be clairvoyant to tell what the zerg is doing ahead of time.

It's really just making me want to try and just 2 base all in so I don't have to play a guessing game. And that sucks because I'm a heavy macro player :/.

So what's the best way to scout and deal with this? The opener just looked like a standard as shit TvP opener and then when I saw he had not expanded yet it looked like a 1/1/1. Should I focus on clearing up medvacs and then units? I don't think I have time to get out an immortal

I just don't want to risk staying on one base against such a build. What I'm afraid of too is the potential for terran to do a 2 pronged attack with this build. ",,t5_2smn2,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/oyuzg/pvt_diamond_defending_against_3_rax_4_medvac/

My own analysis of my replay:

Macro wasn't too poor most of the time

Scouting needs improvement

Need to be more aggressive

After losing almost all sentries and stalkers I shouldn't have attacked with just a few zealots and a bunch of collossi as it was wasteful

Drops were pretty terribly done

A third would've been a good idea after repelling the first attack on my natural.

Two robotics facilities were not needed so early

Should have built more stalkers or maybe even some phoenix to kill off corrupters (I knew they would be coming out but didn't do it for some reason)

Turrets should have gone up at natural expansion sooner than they did

I'm a low level player so I'm sure I missed other stuff

Hope I did that right ^ .

It's been 2 weeks but suddenly every terran is doing a pre lair timing w/o tanks. Its heavy hellions combined with bio or just more faggoty hellions and it is doing just tons of damage. I Usually do 2 base muta with a spine and 3'rd queen for hellions

So while i figure out how to hold this off and take a third at the same time, I can revert to cheese until I calm down. Cheers.",,False,,t5_2smn2,False,race-z,
