I was was raised on ST:TNG. Every Saturday at 10pm a new episode would premiere

Science fiction is more than just a ""cool story"" -- it allows us to place present problems into a ""future"" landscape. Science fiction also allows us to map our responses and consequences beforehand. 

ST: TNG brought up many moral problems -- The re-imagined BSG has done done the same and honed in on relevant struggles today. 

If you're a reader like I am -- and love Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov

BSG needs to be put back on television. It won awards and made money

""Blood and Chrome"" isn't an ideal expression of BSG, and let the network know it will make them money.

Laura motherfrakking Roslin. She is a badass without having to shoot a gun or fly a viper. To quote a Dos Equis commercial

Her family's dead, she made tons of retarded decisions, but most of those were attempts to help the human race hold on.

The scene i like the most was in ""Blood on the Scales"" (I think):

######During the mutiny

 Also from Daybreak:

######leaving sickbay to go to the hangar deck before the final battle. Making everyone else look like a pussy. 

I wish I could handle shitty situations with as much positivity and grace as her. Also my heart shattered during the finale

TLDR; Roslin 2012.

[Spoilers!]",BrainsAreCool,93,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/BSG/comments/1ehfcd/i_just_finished_watching_the_series_i_gotta_say_i/, which I'm pretty grateful for since it means I wasn't at all disappointed. Throughout the series I didn't really care for the the idea that there was some supernatural God or force controlling events in peoples lives. I found myself liking characters like Adama and John the most because they at least seemed to be the only ones able to keep their heads above the tide of confusion around them. For a while whether or not there are supernatural forces at work in the BSG universe was somewhat of a mystery. That is

There are no supernatural forces in the BSG universe. What's really going on here is some malevolent and controlling force is essentially farming the human race. All of this has happened before and will happen again. When the hybrid came back with that statement is when my mind started racing. Basically, and then that life seeks to destroy the humans. When the humans landed on new Earth everybody went their separate ways and they sent their ships into the sun. However... the centurions were given their independence and were sent away to be forgotten by humanity. Meaning that this perfectly orchestrated cycle was designed to do one thing and one thing only: produce new robotic life. 

I suspect that whatever this force is that's responsible for coordinating these events is probably a machine force of some kind which would explain why the hybrids can access it to provide us with occasional insight into their master plan. It would also account for their motives; they want to learn about their origins and better themselves. Human life probably created them and by forcing humans to undergo a cycle where they continually create new lifeforms they're able to learn more about themselves and grow exciting new robotic lifeforms like the centurions. Which I think is downright delicious science fiction. 

The Caprica 6 and Gaius Baltar had a shared vision and were unwitting tools for this force. It was Caprica 6 who gave the centurions free will thereby granting them independence to explore the cosmos alone. It was Starbuck who was a key pawn in making sure that humanity found new Earth, civilization or whatever. Whoever these overseers are they probably also are responsible for baiting the cylons and teaching them about resurrection. It's even possible that they acquired and reprogrammed them to serve their own ends. Whether or not they're strictly interested in farming the human race for information is hard to know. Gaius and Caprica 6 were conversing at the end of the series about how things will turn out this time and how it might be different, so it could be possible that they're not exactly farming us for information but they could also be guarding us should we grow into something more. 

It may also be true that when the 5 came together they may have been granted access to this knowledge but failed because Galen Tyrol killed Tory Foster. But we'll never know. 

All in all I LOVED the show. I was extremely worried about the shows ending since I saw a few threads here and there (I didn't read them) about how people were angered by how things ended. I actually loved the ending I think it's great that different people seem to be interpreting the ending differently. However I think I'm fairly confident that I got the ending pretty much pegged.

- ""Frak!"" is said


Take two drinks anytime:


- Tigh smiles

- Someone mentions what a great pilot Starbuck is

Some interesting facts I learned:

* The sets were mostly real-scale and HUGE with minimal greenscreen. Both Helo and Anders very rarely had to do anything with green screen. The CIC and hallways in the Battlestar were so expansive that Tahmoh actually got lost in them and had to call for help to find his way out.

* Trucco found out he was going to be a cylon only just before filming the episode where it's revealed. Aaron Douglas spoiled it for him before he could finish reading the script, I know. Weird, isn't it?"" as if he had no control over it either.

* The toughest scenes for Helo to film were season one having freezing rain poured on him in Caprica, or the scene where he and Tyrol rescue Athena from being raped. His favorite scenes were running and gunning with Katee in season 1.

* The toughest scenes for Anders were sitting in the tub as a Hybrid at the end of season 4... He had to do 3 hours of makeup at the beginning of the day, pulling everyone together and saying ""This is going to be the best frakkin show you ever do"". Trucco did a perfect EJO impression.

* Helo wasn't originally written in to box in the boxing episode. He had to go complain to the producers three separate times before they stuck him in there and let him put his Muay Thai experience to use.

* Anders wasn't totally sure why he was stuck in a viper for a few episodes

* Since he spent almost the entire first season on a separate set

* Michael Trucco didn't actively avoid watching the shows on air

* Some girl asked Tahmoh ""whether Adama would have killed Cally if he found out if she was leading the resistance against him."" Tahmoh and the entire audience had no clue what she was talking about. If anyone could shed some light on this I'd love to hear it.

I'm freaking drained

I've spent the last 3 hours reading posts on this subreddit and finding articles and videos about the series to fill the time. I guess I'm in the minority here since I really enjoyed every single episode of season 4 and the ending. I teared up in the final episode a few times

My favorite characters probably in this order:
- Adama (of course)
- Starbuck (actually kind of liked her ending
- Helo and Athena

Although I tried to stay away from spoilers, I thought I was smart when I deduced that her dad is Daniel; apparently that's been debunked by the writers. Even still, I don't mind leaving that a little too open ended.

######Logically,000 survivors, right? Most of these people were born and raised in cities, then spent a few years(?) living inside spaceships. There is absolutely zero chance that more people would survive out in the unexplored wilderness than would survive inside their damn spaceships. *This is an uncharted planet!* I mean, for a group of people so defined throughout the show by their tendency to disagree with each other, they sure went along with that shitty plan pretty quietly. 

######Not to mention that almost none of the insane character development that took place over four seasons got resolved! Gaius and Caprica got their ending as Adam and Eve

I remember reading about how the writers refused to drag it out and milk it for more seasons like some other shows (cough *SG-1*cough), the ship falls apart and within a few episodes, by a stroke of plot-device magic they find a habitable planet that, supposedly, we currently inhabit. And don't even get me started on glaring holes in logic and unanswered questions. Why didn't they treat Roslyn with the half-cylon blood a second time? What is the deal with Starbuck, why do they leave her so shrouded in mystery?  Where did she go when she ""died?"" 

And that's not all. When I go from season 3 or 4 to season 1, or else they were making it up as they went, or else lost funding and just tried to tie it off as neatly as they could. I liked the ending, I thought it was brilliant and made most of the loose ends not matter so much... but they are still loose ends. And it does feel like there was a gap or a redirect or something not planned from the beginning that really messed with the story.

Does anyone know if the writers had a similar situation to the writers of Lost? I.e they had an idea of what they were going to do

* Kara - I'm sorry but i hated her for i reckon.... 90% of it. 
* Sam - Best Pyramid player in the 12 colonies gets beaten by Starbuck first time they meet. C-Bucks rule! (yer right...) Why did nothing happen to him when he shot Felix in the leg! 
* Boomer - i thought that her and Athena's were 2 of the more interesting characters and not enough was done to explore/blur the lines between human/cylon. It's like they forgot all about Boomer's character for 2 seasons and then only brought her back for a bit to take Hera away.
* Bill Adama - thought it was ridiculous how he kept Tigh on after he found out he was one of the final 5. There is a photo in the best of r/bsg about how it's more realistic that Star Trek. Well yes probably
* Tigh - my most hated character to be honest. basically spent the entire show gurning and drinking and not a lot else. Why did Six have sex with Tigh?!?
* Baltar - thought he was a parody of himself for most of the show. I really liked his story when he thought he was losing his mind and if Six was real or not
* Lee - get some better fitting suits.
* survivors on other planets. So Sam et al were some of the resistance on Caprica...ok. firstly i thought there was a full radioactive fallout. k
* Frakking is without doubt the most annoying word. Every time it was said it made me lose my immersion in the story and just think it was stupid. I know it was probably done to make it slightly more family friendly (airing/certifications) but just made me wince every time. 
I think i mentioned above that i thought hte best story lines were the ones that blured what it meant to be human. i.e. Boomer coming to terms that she might be Cylon. or Six's love for Baltar and i think more should have been done to pursue that. Id did seem that the final 5 (well 4) came to terms with being Cylon pretty easily compared to Boomer in series 1. those 5 being the final 5 didnt fit too well for me to be honest. 


Oh man there were loads of other things that i have already forgotten. rant over.... im so sorry for the garbled mess above. I really liked the show overall

bsg love. So say we all.

Edit: another thing I don't get.  So why did the final 5 conceal who they were from themselves? It was of no benifit for themselves. I know it was touched on but how did Saul have hair when he was younger,False,self,t5_2qlvu,1375987369.0,,,t3_1jygh3

My gf and I are rewatching this show. I forgot how amazing it was. I finished watching the show the first time before I realized the internet was good place to talk about shit.

About the ending

But now rewatching the show I have suddenly realized the ending does make a lot more sense than I realized. 

Reason I ask is because we just watched the infamous ""Maelstrom"" episode. And it was during this episode that I realized what I think happened to Starbuck. It is pretty clear that she did in fact die during this episode. It is also fairly apparent that the Cylons intended her to come back and bring them to Earth. 

Basically my theory is that all humans have some basic capacity to receive projections. Six claimed only Gaius could because he was some kind of angel, she was basically a projection into the human's minds because they wanted her to guide the humans to Earth. Some of the Cylons always wanted this, but not all of them, which is kind of why the Cylon Civil War happened. Over time they were more motivated to ally with humans than conquer them.

There is another theory that says the Starbuck's visions were actually Daniel in disguise. Daniel being the Cylon that was ""boxed"" before the beginning of the show. One of the models escaped boxing and knocked up Kara's mom somehow. That would explain all the talk of her being special

So it's gotta be some combination between these two. What are the prevailing ideas? Any links ppl can point me too? And don't just say it didn't make sense or the writers just made shit up. I really don't think that's what happened

The premise was so *bleak*. It's probably the most depressing show I've ever seen. Throughout seasons 1 and 2 I had multiple theories going around in my head about how the Cylons had somehow mathematically predicted everything and were ten steps ahead of Galactica and the fleet at any given time. It felt like watching a fly with his wings cut off scurry around in a jar

I've never hated anything more in a fictional setting than I hated the Cylons. They were the *perfect* antagonist. They pushed all of my buttons

So now I'll move onto my questions. I have been curious about the original BSG series. I'm aware of some differences between the two series

Before Boomer is killed, she can remember meeting Kara for the first time, she has all of Boomers memories.

######I love chubby Apollo. It's so bad

######I love Saul Tigh. He could easily be a one-dimensional character, he kills his wife. When he decides to drink, he drinks all the alcohol. I especially enjoyed watching him take down Bulldog. A cranky old drunk beats the hell out of a man that has been doing push-ups in a cell for years. 

######When Laura tells Bill to 'Open to page 61'. Lots of subtle things in that scene that add another layer of humanity to two of the strongest characters in the show. 

######Laura's response to the request for surrender. God damn, she thinks she has lost everything that matters to her, and she just gives Gata &amp; Zerrik the finger. 

######All of the scenes where Bill &amp; Saul are either laughing hysterically or beating the hell out of each other. You really get a sense of their relationship outside of the CIC. 

######When Starbuck rescues Apollo from the mutineers in the hangar bay. It's an epitomical moment for Starbuck. Any other time in a situation like this

######Gata's interview for the documentary. It's so contrary to everything else we've seen about him. Yet,False,self,t5_2qlvu,False,,,t3_ndycl

&gt;Galen Tyrol got one of the worst lots in all of Battlestar Galactica. First it turns out that the woman he loves is a Cylon. Then she gets killed just when he starts to resolve his feelings toward her. Then a twin with her memories shows up, he discovers that his wife was actual killed by one of his fellow “Final Five” Cylons. It’s a pretty rough go, to say the least.
