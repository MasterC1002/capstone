1331319331.0,qp7vc,Don't buy Lexmark printers.,Benbulthuis,553,80,260,"So here is why you should never buy a Lexmark printer.

I purchased a Prevail 705 for my home office about a year and a half ago. I rarely print

Lexmark offers two black cartridges: a 100XL

Now, I swapped the RFID chip from the old cartridge to the new cartridge and voila, it is recognized as fully compatibile and prints like new.

But wait: The print cartridge still shows as 35% full, and after X number of pages you have to change the cartridge. By re-using the old RFID chip, my printer thinks my brand new cartridge is at 35% capacity.

(AMENDED THIS PER RESULTS OF MY TESTING) Here is where the total bullshit starts: If you continue to print, despite the fact that the cartridge is mostly full, it will still print black text with lines through it and other artifacts that indicate you are out of ink. That would mean Lexmark intentionally programmed them to do this.

Why are they doing all of this? To scam you into paying for either A) A $200-300 printer to use cheap ink

Fuck Lexmark. 

Edit 1: Additional information from the Amazon user reviews. Just want to post this so other people see I am not making it up: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E5MYFLWH7BLR/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B002E9N5PW&amp;nodeID=172282&amp;tag=&amp;linkCode=#wasThisHelpful

Edit 2: Pictures of said cartridges:

http://imgur.com/MKvwm - 100XL on the left

http://imgur.com/BNgrp - another comparison

http://imgur.com/NbjsZ - this is where the RFID tag is located

Edit 3: I was asked to confirm that the printer will print bad black text. I originally read that problem here: 

http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E5MYFLWH7BLR/ref=cm_cr_rev_detmd_pl?ie=UTF8&amp;cdForum=Fx3B6UPRO9WAFCL&amp;cdMsgNo=19&amp;cdPage=2&amp;asin=B002E9N5PW&amp;store=electronics&amp;cdSort=oldest&amp;cdThread=Tx7UMPK9HPPJF3&amp;cdMsgID=Mx134MUWOFFQBNM#Mx134MUWOFFQBNM

However, set the printer to ""automatic"" quality, and printed it until I ""ran out of ink"". The cartridge is advertised as offering 1 cent B&amp;W prints, so at $5 it should offer around 500 prints on a new cartridge. Mine failed at around ~150 pages of black and white text. It did NOT start printing erratically or print bad text in my case - it printed one final page, and refused to print anymore. This actually lends credence to the idea that the printers have a pre-determined # of prints per cartridge, set in the RFID chip, as the old RFID chip from my last cartridge had been reporting 25-35% capacity. However I cannot confirm the above users post. In either case,,True,t3_qp7vc

Well.  Yeah, or something falling on the board on the assembly line, or a number of other reasons that are not my fault. 

Newegg says they don't care, I pointed out that the Warranty of Merchantability says they have to refund/replace defective products if they don't work. The supervisor told me that their company policy supersedes US law. 

Guess I'll have to start doing builds with other vendors, I can't afford to shop there anymore.


This is not the Newegg that I used to shop at. Buyer beware.

These are coming out with 280+ppi screens, gyroscopes, GPS, 3G, etc.

Intel-style ""Ultrabooks"" are also trying to bridge the gap from the other end

I have had two 13"" macbooks given to me to fix recently and from an ease of maintainance perspective they are the worst machines I have EVER had to work on. 

~~Keyboard cannot be replaced without replacing the entire trackpad top cover assembly. That is just evil.

~~Screen panel cannot be replaced without dismantling half the machine (due to retarded design of hinge cover).

~~Screen bezel is attached by little grey plastic clips which warp and pull out making bezel replacement fiddly.

~~Battery cannot be easily attached without L bracket because of stupid eject levers for ram.

~~Almost every screw is different

~~Error messages are just meaningless pictograms.

~~Many startup options require a 4 FINGER keypress combination to activate.

These are expensive machines

It basically allows you to order a mousepad off your very own design
For anyone interested:

- Create an account on www.artscow.com (Remeber to disable the news emails

- Go to this webpage: http://www.artscow.com/photo-gifts/mousepad/large-mousepad-160 and customize your mousepad. Hint: Don't use a picture that is too dark. It might get a little wierd as the mousepads are a bit dark in colour.

- Put it in your cart and go to checkout.
Fear not when you see the price being around the 10$ + postage!

- Insert the coupon saying ""MOUSEPADFREE"" and see the price magically vanish  into nothing!

- Order

And some extras: I think it's only possible to order 1 mousepad per adress/account/IP (Well it won't let me order anymore
And it takes around 6-20 days before you recieve it. Depending where you live (Took 7 days here in Europe. I'm pretty sure they ship from Hong Kong)

Background: I own a small business that does computer design and manufacturing. We've done work on everything from NetTop's, Digital Signage you name it - we don't offer much of a standard product line - most designs are proprietary to the company that contracts them.

We don't do this with laptops - you can buy a laptop for $200-$300 stand alone in any electronics store - there is no huge move to subsidize them with a two-year contract for all-the-time wireless data access.

_***EVENT IS ON MARCH 7

---

1. [Event signup](http://global.amd.com/LP=543)

2. [My verification](https://twitter.com/Thracks/statuses/307732374433697792)

**Q. Uh

A. The night before [SXSWi](http://sxsw.com/interactive) kicks off

1.	It will be hosted by Chris Pirillo. RIP TechTV. /tear

2.	We’ll be showing off some really impressive PC mods built by legendary modders like Ben Heckendorn (aka ""Benheck"")

3.	We’ll be showing AMD FirePro driving a 3D printer

4.	We've invested in a company called CiiNow to leverage our AMD FirePro products to render cloud gaming on the backend. You'll get a crack at the first-ever public demonstration of that technology. Maybe cloud gaming isn't your bag

5. Prizes! We're giving away scores of coupons for the Never Settle: Reloaded bundle (cards for Crysis 3 + BioShock Infinite ***-OR-*** BioShock Infinite + Tomb Raider). We also have a beastly, too. Lots more stuff.

5.	There will be a blogger's lounge (if you're into that sort of thing), and some other surprises we’re cooking up.  Thanks to our PR agency (Edelman Digital), the whole event is at an awesome loft at 6th and Congress in downtown Austin.

6. And lots of game demos! If you haven't had a chance to try Eyefinity

So

//EDIT: Or maybe you just want to stand in a corner and discuss smartphones or something. My Nexus 4's body is ready.

//EDIT 2:

Q. **What is the AMD Advocate program on the signup?**

A. Members of the program will occasionally get the chance to take home an AMD product in exchange for giving the product some airtime on their blog, we want to make reviewers out of ordinary people who will get a chance to spend some time with a CPU or a graphics card and the like. Honestly and openly share your thoughts, start a conversation, get people talking. That's all we ask. :)",,False,,1362250918.0,t3_19if5p

* ""PWM Duty Off""
* ""PWM Duty Start""
* ""Start PWM Value""
* ""Smart Fan Slope""

I was like ""The hell?"" SpeedFan told me it has an IT8712F-J and an IT8716F. (Actually

So

NOTE: the IC uses the values 0...127 to represent 0%...100% duty cycle (it's a PWM thing, or even higher, to even start. Test your fan and see what it does.**

* PWM Duty Off: In degrees Celsius. If the CPU temperature falls to below *5 degrees less than* this setting (the BIOS is hardcoded to write a 5-degree hysteresis to the IC's register)
* PWM Duty Start: In degrees Celsius. Call this ""S"". See below.
* Start PWM Value: Call this ""V"". When the ""PWM Duty Start"" temperature is exceeded
* Smart Fan Slope: I'll call it ""K"". This is really complicated -- I'll give it its own set of paragraphs.

Okay, and multiply by 8: put the product into the BIOS field. Yes, this means the maximum is 15.875. Deal with it. And yes, you can have decimal amounts. I think the IC rounds calculations internally but I'm not 100% sure.

Each degree that the processor's temperature increases (well call its temperature C), unless it's already at that speed or higher. Likewise, each degree that the processor's temperature *de*creases, the fan speed is set to V + (C+5 - S) * K (or simply V if this would put it below V), unless it's already at the calculated speed or lower. (5 is the hysteresis, and again, it's hardcoded into the BIOS on this board.) Obviously

So for the fan to hit max speed at S+x degrees, deal with it.

Hope this helps someone.

Before I begin, things went like this:

* Linksys Wireless - Couldn't wireless its way through a gyproc wall.
* Linksys 4-port - Randomly entered into a panic mode and refused any and all connections
* D-Link DI-624 with Wireless - Crashed and self-rebooted at such breakneck speed that I was banned from a chatroom for join-flooding at 2:00 AM while I was asleep.
* Inexq 4-port - Modifying the virtual server parameters caused the router to immediately crash.
* Homemade m0n0wall box - Both NICs physically failed after a week.
* Bell Sympatico router-modem combo - Oftentimes lost connection for no apparent reason
* Linksys-Cisco WRT54GL - One of the physical ports became inoperative

The reason I do not simply RMA the WRT54GL is because this is the only router I have on hand at the moment

And no

*Whenever I ask for router recommendations

**Option #1** is to buy another WRT54GL on the basis that the one I got was a lemon.

**Option #2** is to grab that ASUS RT-N66U that I've seen in some recommendations

**Option #3** is to grab a lower-grade ASUS router.  Or other company and pray for the best (see italic text above for why I say that).

Please

So yesterday the GTX680 Mac Edition came out. My good friend and I wanted to have a little gaming session this weekend - he has a Mac Pro (with windows for gaming) and there has not been any significant upgrade for graphic cards for his machine for a long while (otherwise it's a very solid machine). He actually wanted to build a new gaming pc before our gaming session - but we found out about the new EVGA card for Mac.

However the deal was either we can get it until friday this week or he doesn't want it (and would go for the new PC instead).

So I started researching all sorts of online shops in Germany and the UK (I speak German he doesn't so I was at an advantage) but nothing. They had the card in their offer but it was either listed not in stock and waiting to get stocked or available by the end of april etc. I totally understand as this card is not for everyone. Usually people use mac pro's for video editing or 3D

We went through the ordering process on the phone - they assured me that the card would be at our address by friday / but you know how deliveries work so we were still nervous we wouldn't get it on time. 

So after placing the order I called again to ask wether we could just go drive to Munich to pick up the card (we live in Slovakia it's about 10 - 12 hours there and back). 

The guy I spoke to told us that it's a very long drive and we shouldn't go through the hassle and promised he would do everything in his possible to assure that the card will be delivered in time.

Today the card arrived - in less than 24 hours - a card which was just out and nowhere to be found. I just want to thank EVGA for their awesome service and thought I'd mention it on Reddit.

Maybe this is normal in the States but living in a pretty disfunctional country like Slovakia this really impressed me and made me happy.

After all the rigorous testing over this weekend, everything worked as intended.  I plug it back in mine, and nothing.  One of these machines I tested in was z77 chipset, same as my own, so we can rule out the chipset not playing nice with 7970s.

I then tested more gpus in my own board, so I know my power supply and cables are fine.  All the gpu slots in my mobo worked with all cards besides my 7970.  It would seem that my 7970 just isn't playing nice with my specific UD3H board...

Except for the kicker.  The absolute *strangest* thing I've ever seen.  I plugged my friend's 295 in the 3.0 x16 slot, and it detects my 7970 perfectly, and I can even use it in games.  I reboot and unplug the 295, suddenly the 7970 is invisible.  

The result of all this is a motherboard that works perfectly fine with everything except for dealing with a solo 7970

I even called the microcenter tech support to see if they had any insight into this specific problem, get another 7970, and a completely different board.  The guy was even laughing at how ridiculous the situation turned out to be.

I plan on doing this unless one of you tech whiz guys manages to identify something I'm doing wrong.  I love the board and I love the card,,False,,t5_2qh18,1364312470.0,,True

From time to time there are stories about very good/bad customer support in r/hardware, because... well... they deserve some publicity for what they did :)

So I own a wireless keyboard/mouse solution from Logitech (the MK250). About a week ago I noticed that the middle mouse button wasn't working anymore. I played around a bit and it pretty much looked like a device error I could do nothing about. Since I read a story on reddit of someone who contacted Logitech due to a faulty device and they gave him a coupon for 50% off to buy a replacement

Note that my MK250 was out of warranty. I'd even lost the original bill that usually acts as proof of ownership/warranty... But oh well

I called the hotline, sounds like a mechanical problem. Just mail me a picture with the serial number, the referal number I give you and your address"". So I did, and like 5 minutes later I got their reply: ""sorry, but we don't produce the MK250 anymore. I can offer you an MK260 (the upgraded model). Would you like the international layout or the german one?""... The whole process took about 10 minutes on Friday. Today they sent me an email confirming that they shipped the keyboard and that they'd cover the shipping cost. :-)

&gt;**【Market View】TrendForce: DRAM Price Increase to Continue

&gt;Published Feb.5 2013

&gt;TrendForce: DRAM Price Increase to Continue

&gt;According to DRAMeXchange, price has become a secondary consideration for PC OEMs as their top priority is to secure their supply source. This change in strategy has strengthened DRAM module prices, bringing 4GB module price to a high of US$18 for the second half of the month, a US$0.50 or nearly 3% increase over the first half of January. Average 4GB price for the entire month rose by 11.11%, a rare occurrence in the past few years due to continually weak demand on the DRAM market.

&gt;In addition to the contract price rebound, will be making product mix adjustments after their merger is complete, and Taiwanese manufacturers are gradually backing out of the DRAM industry. As a result, supply is decreasing rapidly, causing PC OEMs procurement difficulties.

&gt;PC makers are showing a desire to gradually increase inventory levels, with some deals closing even higher than contract prices and approaching spot prices. The highest priced transaction was conducted at US$20, a good sign for contract prices. TrendForce expects DRAM contract price will continue rising throughout the first quarter due to these supply changes.

&gt;Rising PC DRAM Price to Slow PC Content Per Unit Growth

&gt;As suppliers decrease commodity DRAM production, which will benefit DRAM makers’ profit margins. However, price increases will also suppress content per unit growth, making it unlikely that the 20% growth that has been seen in previous years will continue.

 
&gt;According to TrendForce research, optimized design of Windows 8, there is no need for significant content per unit increases. Furthermore, as BOM cost for mainstream notebooks has already fallen below US$500, there is little room for DRAM cost increases. Currently, average 4GB module contract price is US$17.75, which represents 3.5% of BOM cost. If prices continue to rise, DRAM will exceed 5% of BOM cost. Therefore, which will have a detrimental effect on PC DRAM consumption.

&gt;TrendForce indicates that the industry is generally reserved towards PC shipments in 2013. With further shrinkage of the PC DRAM outlet due to the DRAM price rebound and suppressed content per unit growth

I bought an ASUS laptop model K53SV-XP1 in October 2011 from an ASUS reseller in Canada which supposedly has a 2 year global warranty as stated on the ASUS website itself. Upon the first week of usage I discovered there was a hardware problem with the dvd-drive as it will open by itself randomly from time to time. Since this was the only issue, free 2 way shipping etc.).  

Slightly after a year, I decided that it was high time I send my laptop in for a repair. However to my aghast, the caller agent insists that my warranty has expired as it is a 1 year warranty. After demanding to speak to the manager, he said that they do not have a manager but have a supervisor. Even after speaking to the supervisor he insists that my warranty is 1 year which doesn’t even make sense since it clearly states on multiple websites online that this model has a 2 year global warranty. I have sent in a request for an escalation on this case on their website but have not received a reply and the only other option I can think of is to sue them in small claims court. What do you guys think?

They have WPA 2 AES encryption which is very unusual in my area. I'm the only one else who has it...LOL.

 I think my Mom is the problem. My parents are from Pakistan and she makes calls to Pakistan everyday and talks for 4-5 hours with MANY different relatives in the tribal areas. She has an addiction to talking on the phone. We had a friend in the police force/military who says he had it on good authority that for a time we were definitely monitored because of my Mom's heavy phone traffic. We also hear all kinds of weird whirs and clicks a few seconds after we use the phones.

Am I being paranoid or Am I under surveillance? I really don't care about the phones. REALLY. I understand why we should be recorded but I don't want the Feds knowing what kind of porn I watch....MILF...okay there I said it. I have an Oedipus complex.

Say Samsung acquired them. How would this benefit us as consumers? Would prices get higher or lower? Would chip availability go higher or lower? Does it dirty your image of AMD to see them as a subsidiary of another company? Do you think Samsung would change branding if they bought AMD?

It was a bit nerve racking separating the IHS

The lapping was pretty much a 'why the hell not' thing

I replaced the stock TIM with Liquid Pro, hopefully I made up with it by applying it fairly well to the IHS but still a bit worrying (luckily temps are all pretty good so it seems like it wasn't too much of a fuck-up).

Ran IBT on high and had HWMonitor + RealTemp running for temps (they seem to be most commonly used but give different readings). Settings for the runs were; 4.4GHz -0.015v, nice to see that I could get reasonable temps at 4.8GHz with a 212 EVO though.

Results:

Checked my startup menu to make sure the drive was recognized

Loaded the cloning Cd that came with the drive and waited a few hours for it to do its thing and let it shut down on its own ( it was an option on the clone software)

Switched her back on but immediately hit the F10 key to get to my startup menu and attempted to reboot from the new drive.

So I have a 120Hz monitor and when we plugged it in, next to the hdmi and display ports, and not the DVI port on bottom next to the heat exhaust. Yay, problem solved.

Next

So my friend and I have not flashed a video card in a while, just make a bootable usb drive^1 , and put atiflash and the included bios onto the drive. Why should it not work? *""MSI made the bios...""*

After putting the contents of the file from that site onto the usb drive and backing up the original bios using [GPU-Z](http://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/)

    ""atiflash -p -f 0 r6950pex.bin"".

Hm, we look at the ""6970 bios"" and we notice that it is only 64KB rather than 128KB like our backup. We noticed that before we flashed, but thought it was safe nonetheless, which proved wrong.

Our next step was to restore the bios that was flashed badly. We booted back into dos using the good bios. Once in dos, and rebooted. All was good, but that wasn't good enough. We still wanted a 6970.

We searched a little more and a link mentioned using [RBE](http://www.techpowerup.com/rbe/) to edit your bios to unlock the extra shaders. So we download RBE, and went to save our new bios. The save prompt wanted to save the new bios as a .rom file rather than a .bin file, and we were a little weary about that. We saved it as ""CaymanGood.rom"" anyway.

We boot into dos

    ""atiflash -f -p 0 CaymanG~1.rom"".

Flash seems successful. Reboot. Get post sounds

Lessons learned/reinforced:

1. Always make a backup if you are going to mess with/flash anything.

2. Don't blindly take/use information without doing some research.

1321608625.0,mgrtp,Totally silent computing - move the PC to another room.,,93,30,100,"I've been reading about quiet PC components for years

I thought about moving the computer into a large closet but I worried about heat in there so I bought some cables and relocated the computer into another room which when the door is closed I can't hear at all (EXCELLENT!!!).

It's a full desktop (which I choose for configurability and fixability) so your results may vary if you're connecting lower powered components like a laptop or something but here's what I used:

25 feet DVI Digital Male to Male Dual Link Cable - from dedicated video card to monitor input (~$15)

32 feet (10 meters) USB 2.0 Active Extension Cable A Male to A Female - from USB on desktop to monitor USB cable (monitor has a built in hub which I connect the keyboard and mouse to) (~$15)

25 feet 3.5mm Audio Cable Male to Female (2x) - one for the desktop audio output to my computer speakers

Everything works great

In my case the DVI connection is solid, I don't notice any input lag on mouse or keyboard.  My computer speakers have a headphone jack so I can use that if I want.  I can crank the desktop fans up and still be totally silent.  For USB stuff like thumb drives I can plug it into my monitor.  If I ever need to use firewire / DVD / power switch / reset switch / eSATA / (never) then it's just a few steps away.

The only sound I hear is from using input devices (keyboard / mouse) and audio from speakers (good!) and if you put your ear RIGHT next to the monitor you can barely hear the LCD monitor (probably the CFL or power buzzing) which is not noticeable at sitting distance.  It's so nice and silent that I find myself getting back into music

Read up on max cable lengths for each type of connection (wikipedia etc...).  In my case I pushed the recommended max and read some reviews about different cables / experiences and got something long enough for my needs but not too long.  Everything works great, you could run an optical cable to a DAC / AMP in another room and use the same keyboard / mouse / monitor setup or just VNC to the desktop from another computer (as a remote control) if you want.  These days tablet computers are totally silent also so that's another thing to think about.

In my case I was able to run all cables under doors so there was no carpentry work.",,t5_2qh18,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/mgrtp/totally_silent_computing_move_the_pc_to_another/

So

At [sub-$110](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811352020)

I'm going to quickly cover the case and why I think it's amazing

**The Case**

* ***Build Quality***  -  I cannot say anything bad about the build quality here. The sound dampening material is the same stuff I have seen in studios

* ***Cooling Abilities*** - I have ran the 800D with my current build, no Overclock except for how it came. I am running at roughly 39c at idle, and I max at 58c under load. In the Obsidian, I would be 1-2 degrees below that at load. Nothing much here.

* ***Cable Guiding*** - The read side of the case has amazing cabling options. Again comparable to the massive 800D.

* ***Quiet*** - Other than the blue LED on the front


* ***Overall Thoughts*** - Great case, I don't run an optical drive so that is not a problem for me. I install all my OS from USB obviously. This is 2013. Not 1999.

**The Company**

Okay, and it set in place by locking plastic columns. It works great, but Amazon fucked up their shipping and it came broken. Okay, fine. In fact it still held on amazingly well with only 2 of the 6 prongs, but I am one of these people who think if it isn't perfect I have to fix it.

So I call up FD. Someone answers the phone on the second ring. No machine, and said hold just oooone second. 20 seconds later he is on the line ""Yep, we got them available I'm gonna send you right now. What is your address?"". What? Seriously? Free? No fucking way!! Give dude my address, 30 minutes later I have an email with tracking info from fed ex. This was last Friday. 20 minutes before closing. It's Wednesday, and here it is.

What's the situation like nowadays? I don't want to start a flamewar

I'm asking because... let's say I want to buy one of the following mobos:

* ASRock H77 PRO4/MVP
* Asus P8H77-V
* Gigabyte GA-H77-D3H
* MSI ZH77A-G43

I have no idea which one should be better

* same chipset with only minor variations in sound/network chips;
* almost the same ports/slots;
* same price (80-85 EUR);
* 3-year warranty.

For desktop intel processors, programs such as coretemp display the core temperature (in reality it's more complex, but that doesn't matter for the purposes of this discussion) not the case temperature. Given that heat flows from from the cores to the top of the heatspreader and into the heatsink, actual core temperature will always be hotter than the area on top of the heat-spreader - thus the core temperature at which a processor will throttle will always be somewhat higher than the tcase specification given by intel.

Details inside.",LoganPhyve,78,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/jszcn/hey_reddit_i_need_some_help_convincing_a_stubborn/

I'm the SysAdmin for a SMB tech company. I LOVE my job and the people I work for/with. That being said

I've recently brought the company through a complete infrastructure upgrade - we've moved from archaic

We need to completely overhaul our backup policies and practices. They're almost non-existent. I'm responsible for multiple Tb's of sensitive accounting, and customer data. Backups are a must, and I'm terrified that we're going to lose something important (after having a baremetal mail server lose 4.5gb /a complete month of ALL employee mailboxes). Needless to say we've made HUGE leaps and bounds towards safety and stable operations, but we're in backup no-mans-land.

We've had several discussions on backup hardware strategy and what equipment I need to follow best practices and ensure we're lawfully compliant as well as ensuring multiple redundancy for our backups (on-site for quick VM or file level recovery

There's a few problems here. My company president is absolutely convinced of the following

* That Snapshots are backups and should be used all the time (It burns!)

* We should be backing up to the SAN (THE SAME SAN THAT HOLDS DATA NOW)

* That backing the SAN up to the same SAN won't have any network or disk iops impact

* That backing up to the SAN won't have any hardware wear-and-tear impact

* That we don't need a second mass-storage appliance for backing up

* That we should buy a tape library and a pile of tapes to back up to

etc etc

I'm looking for literature - documentation, whatever I can find to reinforce that snapshots aren't backups, that we need a separate physical entity to send backups to, and that tapes are a horrible idea. I absolutely, positively ~~do NOT~~ WILL NOT target a backup to the source, that's just asking for trouble and waiting for failure. I don't want to use tape (rather have a second dedicated SAN/NAS &amp; removeable sleds for off-site in conjunction with using our amazon S3 bucket). I need to convince him that a snapshot is NOT a backup. He won't listen to reason...

Does anyone have any good resources to help educate someone that is only knowledgable enough to be extremely dangerous and hindering of necessary upgrades?

If you click [windows key] + [x], specifically ""Turn Off"" or ""Turn On""...

At this point you can probably guess what happens. Someone will click ""Turn Off"" with the touchpad and then my touchpad is disabled. I have found NO way to turn it back on except if I plug in an external mouse (which I don't always have).

I'm trying not to resort to violence. Especially since there's an attendance sheet / assigned seats so if I killed the person next to me

Is there a shortcut key for enabling my touchpad? 

Edit: Thanks luksy! That's what I'll do.

luksy's fix (give that kind redditor an upvote):

[windows key] x [x]
