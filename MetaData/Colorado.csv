Clear all dead and dry brush and grass away from your house; the further away you clear the safer you are. Nothing flammable should be right next to your house including wood mulch. If I still lived in the Springs I’d be taking out the hedges and rose bushes near the house. Stacks of wood, etc. need to go away. Be 100% thorough. Mow everything within 10-15 feet of your home. Rake the dead stuff right next to your home. It will get very hot for quite awhile and those green leaves will turn as dry as paper and then eventually burn.

Trees are now your enemy and may cost you your home. Cut down spruce trees that overhang or are right next to your home. Cut off all low dead branches.

Be smart about where you put debris; expect it to be very windy when your neighborhood burns over.

Clean your decks and carports; just pile things in the garage for now. Put the extra car or boat in the garage or away from the house.

If you live on a hill realize that fire spreads more quickly uphill.

Find your photo albums and prized possessions; load them in boxes

1337839057.0,u2d3r,Welcome Tourists!,seesaw242,47,7,28,"Planning on a visit to or through Colorado this summer?  Welcome!

There are so many things to do and see in Colorado

Being a long time (30+ years) resident I can tell you that you will not be disappointed!  Want some suggestions on things to do?  We are here to help.

First a few simple requests...

When hiking in our beautiful mountains and prairies it is important that you stay on marked trails and respect signs for restricted areas.  Some of our most beautiful locations now have ugly walkways with handrails and signs posted every few hundred yards because some people just can't resist the urge.

Please

Many scenic roadways are also available for you to enjoy.  Be sure to only pull off in designated parking areas in our wilderness areas.  Erosion is a serious issue which can require costly repairs and have a bad impact on our natural beauty.  Bicycles are frequent even above 10

Chances are there is a marked pullout just a bit further up the road.  If you stop at every jaw dropping vista in Colorado you may as well just leave the car behind and walk because you will probably find one around every bend.

If you haven't driven in the mountains before you should take some time to learn about the challenges you may face.  [Here](http://driversed.com/teen-drivers-education/Mountain-Driving.aspx) is a pretty good site that covers the basics of mountain driving.

We love our pets and would love to meet your pets too!  It's too bad some people have been irresponsible pet owners and there are now so many places pets aren't welcome.  Please respect posted leash and animal restriction requests.  Many of our trails are open to horses and a narrow section of trail

Ticks carrying [Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001677/) and Mosquitos can be a problem in Colorado.  Check yourself and pets for ticks after wandering the wilds.  Mosquitos in the high country are most active around dawn and dusk.  Repellent products that contain DEET seem to be the most effective.

Wildlife can be dangerous but the average bobcat or bear isn't out to eat a tourist.  If you stumble upon large animals or they stumble up on you be careful, back slowly away until you are a comfortable distance from the animal before you tweet a picture of it then leave the area.  It's their home and your tromping through it.  Show a little respect, pay attention and you will be fine.

If an animal does become aggressive put your hands up to appear larger, not just volume).  Do not advance or feint toward the animal!  Slowly back away, count your kids and when you have a comfortable distance hoof it on out of there.

If you're camping use a bear bag and don't keep ANYTHING that smells sweet (lotion, jerky, granola...) anywhere near your tent.  How close to your tent do you want bears to get?  That's about half the distance you want between you and anything a bear might find appetizing.  When you hear a 300lb behemoth snuffling around your campsite in the dead of night with only half a millimeter or nylon between you and it you will be wishing you put it even further away.

If you are on the plains or in the mountains weather can change FAST in Colorado.  Be prepared.  Don't park in a shallow areas or in narrow places where rising water can swamp your vehicle.  Do NOT drive through flooded roadways.  Bring rain gear even on the most cloud-free day you have ever seen.

You can count on losing about 4 degrees F for each 1000' in altitude you gain.  Dress in layers so you can easily add and remove clothing to stay comfortable.  If you go from Denver (~5000ft) at 80F up to say 10000ft (60F) and you add a little rain and some windchill and you'd trade your life savings for a pair of long pants and some socks.

[Here](http://walking.about.com/od/gear/tp/whatnottowearfunction.htm) is some good information on what you should/shouldn't wear when hiking.

Higher altitude means less atmosphere between you and the sun

Stay hydrated, nausea or dizziness and you just got here it's probably altitude sickness, get hydrated, get in some shade, get your core temp down and take a little rest, it will pass soon enough.

I used to be an EMT here in the high country I have seen people die and get carted to the hospital for not following these simple pieces of advice.  Be alert to your own condition and that of your companions.

I recently moved to CO, the dog only needs to be watched for 2 weeks max (probably 1.5), because then my uncle who lives in the area will be able to take him and watch him until im home.

My question is: Are there any redditors in the front range Colorado area that would be willing to provide shelter and stimulation for my boy for a few weeks? He is a 2.5 year old pit mix named Edmond, medication, and has no allergies, very low maintenance. I can pay a little, but we may have to do a bit of negotiating or trade. He spends most of the day outside normally so a place with a yard and some other dog friends is preferable. Any help would be great.

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community. We will be in Colorado during the summer and looking to find great people now. 

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, ME and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, pure chance

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions

*  Prevention: clear all the brush near your house, attics, and sheds. 

*  Preparation: Have a go bag with at least change of clothes and a month's worth of any prescription medicine for the whole family. Have fire exits planned in your house. Have exits from your neighborhood planned too. 

*  Dealing when a fire starts: Get gone. Don't argue with emergency services. Don't cry at them over your pets in the house and make traffic worse. Be a pro and keep your mouth shut and follow directions. If it turns out you had plenty of time

1357287316.0,15xwrf,Denver Post burns pedicabbers - A word from the horse's mouth.,shr3dh3d,30,6,3,"Hi reddit

I am a musician, Denver Post released this article that explains some of the new city requirements for our fledgling business. Among them do indeed require all operating pedicabs to have a city issued license plate on them by March 1. In the article are a number of other claims that I would like to comment on as professional ‘cabber myself. Most of the article brings attention to the unlicensed pedicabbers who still operate with an expired ‘pedal cab license’. This is what we are required to keep current to rent and operate a pedicab from any of the owners of the actual pedal cabs (or rickshaw, bike taxi, etc.). I can’t speak for all of the drivers that are out there on a regular basis, but I can assure you that the large majority of us take our work seriously, and we do everything we can to meet the legal and fiscal requirements of our operation. Any pedicabber who has a legit license will very likely (and proudly) display the laminated green and white card that indicates we have an up-to-date license on our cab or person.
	
Also stated in the Denver Post’s article are claims of $10/block overcharges and “games of chicken” on 16th st mall. I can neither verify or discredit these occurrences, and you can be certain that if we are all lined up outside of a venue after an event, we all have a similar price for the more common destinations throughout the downtown area. That being said, I would always rather give a ride to you for whatever price we can agree on than simply not give a ride. We are all highly negotiable. Please give us a chance before you dismiss our service as too expensive or kitschy.
	
As for the games of chicken, but Denver drivers are at least conscientious enough to share the road with us (however against their will...;). Furthermore, the companies renting the cabs DO insure the passengers. The industry standard is already well over a million dollars per cab despite the current legal limit being only $300,000.
	
So please, I consider my service a necessity as much as it is a novelty, and I would be elated to give you a ride sometime. Thank you Denverites! Please let us know what you think of our pedicab community...

I just want to get away, laugh, and finally come back with some interesting new stories to tell. I will pay for myself 100%, I am just looking for maybe a couch or spare bedroom and a host who is willing to show me around. 

About me:

* I am 25 years old 
* I am a veteran of the armed services (I served in Iraq from 2009 to 2010 as medic)
* I have just completed my first semester at a community college. I wish to become an optometrist.
* I am shy and reserved but I wish to break out of my shell; hence this 'sudden' vacation!
* I am honest to a fault which sometimes means I come off as rude or dickish. I really try not to be
* I promise to be as little of a bother as I can. If you allow me to stay in your home, you decide I should no longer stay, I can always get a hotel. 

Some things I would like to do (no particular order)

* Go skiing or learn to snowboard
* Eat at an upscale restaurant (before I left for my deployment me and some of my army friends ate a restaurant. I paid $60 per plate
* See some attractions (weather permitting)
* Get way drunk one night and try to (i'm usually unsuccessful) not throw up
* Eat some edibles
* Go snowmobiling or some other outdoor activity
* Try wine for the first time
* Eat sushi
* Get a tattoo

I would (ideally) like to arrive before New Years and leave after about a week. Time is of the essence as the cost of plane tickets are rising fast (currently at about $500 - $600 for round trip). My budget for this whole trip is $1500

If you are interested

Thanks for reading and I look forward to visiting your state!

I currently rent a room inside a house along with 3 other people. The owner of the house cannot be contacted, the manager has raised rent without notification in writing. The last week, 6 days the shower/bath in the house was under construction due to mold and health concerns, and all tenants had to go elsewhere to shower and such. 

Some of my personal concerns and issues:

 Typically I work evenings 2pm-Midnight, and possibly him simply trying to aggravate me? 

He will leave chores for us to do (e.g. wipe down counters, &amp; mop). Us as tenants do the chores and when he comes in later that week, he just charges us a 10$ fee for failure to meet standards. At this point we dont even do the chores and just pay him because why should we waste a couple hours of our time doing said chores when he still charges us. 

The manager sat me down and told me that taking a 10minute shower was being wasteful and not energy conscious. And that having my lamp in my bedroom on from when I come in from work til the morning hours was also a violation. And granted sometimes I simply pass out and it is left on

Since it's a house with so many tenants I park on the street in front of the house. The neighbors sometimes like to park in front of the house and take up the few places we have to park and leave us walking from up the block. Confronting the neighbor about the issue

I've tried contacting some lawyers/attorneys to no avail. Fees for consults above 200$. If anyone has any ideas or suggestions,False,self,t5_2qhkb,False,,,t3_xikh5
