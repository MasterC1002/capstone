Here is our first update/news post. **Please upvote for visibility**

**Additional moderator wanted:**

* Must be a frequent redditor *(visit reddit at least every day)*
* Must know basic moderating functions *(check the modqueue &amp; mod mail)*
* You get 'Mod' flair

If interested

**CSS changes:**

I've made some minor CSS changes.

But if there's anything you don't like about the current CSS

**Allow discussion posts:**

At the moment, videos too)* of your Mac setup. Occasionally a discussion post shows up. What I've taken to doing is leaving it there, letting the OP know that that's not the content /r/macsetups is looking for, then a couple of days after the discussion has ended, I delete it (to keep the archive clean).

What are your thoughts on this


If there's anything else you want to change about /r/macsetups

The monitor on the left is a standard HP 21 Inch. on the right is a 110"" 1080P Projection, when necessary. my question; is whether its possible to quickly switch control of the Keyboard mouse and all three monitors between the two systems. Could i use the Macbook Pro Monitor as a third monitor on the Mac Pro? allowing a Dual Desktop in front of me, and Playback on the Projector. and could i easily switch all three displays to the Macbook Pro? along with control of the Keyboard and Mouse?
