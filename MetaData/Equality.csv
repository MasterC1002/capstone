They also point out that women are viewed more highly the fewer # of sexual partners they've had... but I've never seen them make the connection that, or god help them, no sexual partners.  In fact, I often see them accuse those they disagree with of being virgins who couldn't possibly get girlfriends.

1. Isn't this equivalent to slut shaming

2. Doesn't this assume heterosexuality as the default as the underlying assumption is that every man wants to have sexual relations with a female?

3. Doesn't this suggest that a man's worth as a human being is determined by how sexually interested women are in him?

4. So does that mean the more women you've had sex with

5.  If a woman needs a man 'like a fish needs a bicycle', and evidence of significant personality flaws?

It may sound rude

She, but the black boys do not do this as often. On top of that, I realize that other people say that teachers ""give"" them grades, but these girls blame their scores on their teachers not their own work. In addition, they blame their teacher's motivation on their race.

I've pointed out the flaws in their thinking to them, as if they were seeing something I don't.

To bring this full circle: equality does not simply rely on how society perceives a group. Sometimes oppressed groups have flaws within them. I think it is especially true for blacks that society has changed a lot to help us. With all we have been given

I'm torn on this issue; on one hand, women have been kept alive over men in times of stress (see the Titanic, Haiti, etc. I don't have more examples, but those two are enough for me).

I used to think that prejudice was limited to the uneducated or stupid. But I've come to see that even those considered to be intellectuals are just as prone. I now attribute it to weakness. Because it takes an incredibly strong mind to overcome the desire to hate and judge those from the same race as someone who has hurt you in the past. I have been hurt plenty of times by whites in the past. I've been pushed down and bullied by white kids

I've been a fan of rock and metal since I was a preteen, didn't answer me if I tried to make conversation or said things like 'wow, you must feel out of place (haha)'. After the third band I was trying so hard to hold back tears that I couldn't really hear the music. 

Each and every time I had prejudice or racism thrown at me it hurt. Hurt like hell; still does. I'm not trying to play ""holier than thou"" but I never held it against all whites and I never would.

It is damn near impossible to become an activist for every issue out there, it's typically a cause they can relate to or just simply feel strongly about.

I'm going to use the Feminism/Men's Rights as examples - as it's something we can all relate as we are (assumed) one or both of these genders. We have men on one side calling out to the feminists on how much they ignore false rape claims or cases on child welfare. On the flipside

The glaring problem with these movements are the extremes, they will simply be shot down and ignored as they are viewed as the problem (and vice versa). You need people to call out these extremists on their own side or you will keep getting ridiculed by your opponent for supporting them (""Silence is betrayal"" so to speak). 

The important step here is to **acknowledge the problems for all sides** and do your best to support one another as we are all pushing for equality. Even, where the focus was on making sure the equality treatment of those who were white. I'd expect the same support from all sides, there are issues for even whites (as there are with blacks, hispanics, native americans, asians etc.), though maybe not as numerous

It's perfectly fine to admit that we are psychologically inclined to support that which we can understand and relate - this being our own race and gender. So **of course** you are going to have the majority of feminists to be female and the majority of male's right to be males. Don't let these biases get in the way of the problems we all face.

I was originally going to use examples from the subreddits /r/feminism, but if you have any sense of equality and rationality, you would easily be able to identify exactly what I am talking about. This was just a tired and angry rambling as I was browsing said subreddits and became a little infuriated. (And as a little sidenote: Some of you need a serious sense of humour and identify what is/isn't sexism &amp; racism).

**TL;DR - What you are fighting for is important as there are problems all across the board. Don't belittle those of other movements because you don't think it has as high of importance. If we didn't have them,False,,t5_2qtp5,False,,,t3_pcz58

That day was today. The principal sent an email to every teacher telling them to send any cross-dresser to the office where they would be sent home to change. This is not okay. No where in the school code does it define what a male should wear versus what a female should wear. It should remain that way. It would simply be unethical to define genders to specific clothing in this day and age. We are supposed to be tolerant of others but I guess we can't be tolerant of cross-dressers. 

This also brings about a gender issue. I think that the students and staff who were opposed to cross dressing were specifically opposed to male cross dressing. If you think about it, shirts, etc. However, if a guy puts on a dress or make-up somehow everyone is offended now.

This doesn't seem fair at all. **Of course

What about finding a suitable definition for 'early pregnancy'

* If a man doesn't want the baby, if the woman hides the fact that she's pregnant, then a man should be able to sue for fraud (or some more proper term) to be absolved of child support.

What do you think?

**EDIT:**

Clarifications [from this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/aqj1j/honest_question_what_do_you_think_about_a_mans/c0ivxem):

&gt; **On what grounds can he be absolved?**

The same grounds on which a woman can choose to be absolved of the baby: Reproductive freedom.

&gt; **In what situations can't he be absolved?**

I suppose after he has already agreed to have officially 'adopted' the child

An interesting corner case is when the man and woman might plan to conceive and then the man gets cold feet. In this case

Another interesting (and perhaps exactly analogous) corner case is when the woman tells the man that she's on birth control but actually is not (or she uses his semen later). In this case

I guess the point is this: If you want a clear legal situation, along these lines, the 'early pregnancy' would serve as a 'grace period' for couples that conceive by mistake without fraud.",,False,,t5_2qtp5,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/aqj5t/defining_a_mans_right_to_choose/

I have no problem with feminism. The movement has made great strides for people who have historically been in a disadvantaged position in terms of economic success and political influence. But I simply can't agree with anyone who says that the feminist movement is pushing for men's rights as well

So, I hope some supporters of feminism will acknowledge that the term is less than man-friendly, and that those who support men's issues will admit to themselves that they are an egalitarian as well and not solely a feminist.

Thank you. That is all.

So please give me your honest opinion and tell me where women's lives in Western society's can be improved. I'll start by offering some common ideas that are talked about. Feel free to add your own.


(1) Do you think rape culture exists? How can we improve rape culture for men and women?

(2) Do you think that contraception should be readily available for all women? Should companies pay for it through their insurances?

(3) Do you think there is sexism in videogames? What about movies?

(4) Do you agree with affirmative action? Does it still have a place in society for women?

(5) Do you think that abortion should be readily available to all women?

(6) Should women have the first and final say about abortion?

(7) Do you think that poor single mom's should be given assistance from the government?

(8) What do you think the number one threat to the equality of women is?

In 2009/2010 it was $1,562,373 toward women. In 2010/2011 it was $3,740,800 toward men and $48,331,443 toward women. 

In 2008/2009 the province dedicated $561,236 toward women's resources. The inflated numbers for women's funding for this year are due to more gender-specific funding toward ending domestic violence. Both 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 had funding toward ending domestic violence that was close to on par with the previous year, but the news releases were quite vague and it was impossible to determine to whom that funding actually went. The numbers for the latter two fiscal years are lower for women's resources because of this. Also, in the latter two fiscal years the province started a Provincial Homelessness Initiative. Under this, more funding has gone toward shelters that house both men and women and more funding has been handed out in the form of low-interest mortgages rather than grants.

It's interesting to note that the funding has increased quite substantially year by year for men, and men (in my province, at least) seem to be getting the short end of the stick.

Most of the funding for women went to shelters, the majority of the funding was dedicated toward addiction and recovery centres. 

I know as a receptionist at the resource centre I see a great deal of helplessness and desperation. Sometimes there is anger and resentment. I volunteer for the men's resource centre because I was in a horribly abusive relationship for years. My ex husband was raised in a family where this sort of behaviour was typical - commended, and that's not fair.

I'm not sure what the solution is. Certainly men need more resources available to them. More programs for fathers, the shelters and transition houses and so on that are currently available to women need to continue to have access to funding so that they can remain operational. How can this problem be solved when there is only so much money to go around? ",,False,,t5_2qtp5,False,,

Today my boss decided to use my image as a promotional tool. This is not my job. I have signed no release. 

I am a full time editor at a small Production company. I have a BFA in Film and have worked here for almost two years

Repeatedly, or get coffee, or pick up everyones lunches. When I was the newest member of the team, this seemed fair. It is a regular part of the job of a Production Assistant, and I was happy to have the work. But that is no longer my position at this company, and as an editor with a product deadline to meet, I don't have time for this. We currently have several production assistants whose job this is. But I continue to be asked to perform these tasks.

I have also been directed to be in promotional media from time to time. This includes having my picture in newspaper articles, and who are paid for the use of their image. 

Perhaps you think I should be flattered. You would be wrong.  I am the only young female at this production company. THIS SHOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE IN HOW I AM TREATED.

I have never been ASKED to participate in these shoots. I have not been paid for the use of my image. My time

Today I had an extra heavy workload. But when my boss arrived at work I clearly overhead him discussing, my boss (the CEO of the company) walk by my office with a simple “hi”. 

Despite being one of the most senior editors at this company

Later the CEO wanders into my office to borrow some push-pins from my bulletin board. I have decided I have had enough and that I am not ok with being used in things that are far outside my job description, that could participate in this side project. 

My bosses response was that because I was the most “attractive” employee he had chosen me to be in this commercial. My response : “ That is misogynistic

This is when I was told to have a private conversation with the CEO. Behind a closed door, and that he didn't like having employees with “bad attitudes”. 

I responded saying that if he was ASKING me to perform in this promotional piece based on my acting ability, not assume. His response was to make it clear that no acting ability was needed, and that I was selected because I was “attractive”. He told me that he did not care if I found this offensive. He then proceeded to tell me that my workplace was not a democracy but a “Kingdom”. He pointed out that since he had used my image in the local newspaper last week that it made sense to use my image again. He had not ASKED to use my image in the paper. This is not a good reason for him to feel he has continued access to the use of my image without my consent. It is an extremely poor justification.

His next words were very carefully selected. “Those who don’t have an attitude of teamwork at this company, but worded in such a way that there wasn't much to report to HR. He gave himself deniability, while making it clear that I had no choice in the use of my image, and no foothold in fighting against his sexual harassment. 

He then gave me a halfhearted “This isn't in your job description, or he would take away my livelihood. 

I weakly reiterated to him that I wished to be ASKED in the future. I wanted him to realize that the use of my image in his side projects should not be assumed. But I felt frightened and defeated. 

As my co-worker set up around me for the commercial shoot

I then told him something that I think the whole world needs to hear. Yes, that with a little pushing, and by instilling a little fear, they can have all the control. 

This can only happen if we allow it to. These people can only act this way if we let them. We can only be trod upon and frightened if we allow it. With an attitude of “There is no place else that would be different or better” and “ It is safer to be quiet and give them what they want” we lose our humanity

But I am not just an “attractive woman”. I am an educated film editor

Today starts my job hunt.  I’m seeking a new team. Not a “Kingdom”

I want to work for a functioning company with morals. Not a Kingdom. 

Edit: I think some people are missing the most important thing here. He wasn't threatening my job because I protested being in his stupid commercial. It was once I told him that calling me ""attractive"" was UNWELCOME that he shut us in the meeting room and started threatening my job,,False,,t5_2qtp5,1360813557.0,,True

But what we can all do is recognize these differences and do our best to make sure no one gets the short end of the stick because of them.

Note: *I recognize that male/female are aspects of sex, we are referring to both perceptions of gender in society and the various maladies of one's sex. So, I did not distinguish between these two aspects.*

**Male**

* A majority of workers in many fields are male

* The ability to fart/burp/etc. and have it be funny

* No need to wear makeup / not evaluated based on looks as heavily

* Can (usually) be heavy and still well-respected

* Can go shirtless in public

* Doesn't experience pain of childbirth

* Doesn't experience menstruation

* Can get angry without being asked if on one's period / without being considered ""bitchy""

* Currently makes more money on average

* Respected more as age increases

* Given de facto preference in applications to schools and employers

* Can look to majority of figures in science and politics

* Can more readily defend and/or prevent rape

* Can gain muscle mass more easily

* Can be bald and have hairier everything without criticism

* Not constantly approached / propositioned for sex/dates

**Female**

* Readily accepted for work with children, elementary school teachers

* Can wear makeup to improve appearance without fear of social alienation

* Can wear tight-fitting or extremely loose clothing or extremely short clothing without any consequences

* Can wear all male or female clothing

* Given preference in divorce court both with respect to finances and property

* Survival is given preference in life-saving situations

* Sexual attraction is not physically apparent to an observer / does not have to worry about inappropriate 
erections

* Given preference in rape cases and cases of domestic violence

* Can be assured of legal protection in violent disputes

* Can obsess over preteen/teen pop sensations without being labeled as pedophilic [a dubious ""advantage""...]

* Current educational curriculum balances more easily with average psychological profile (e.g. lower instances of ADHD

* Given legal preference in applications to schools and employers

* Can hang out with members of both genders without being labeled by sexual preference 

* Can express emotional insecurity more openly

* Female homosexuality is viewed more favorably within the society (subject to change)

* Being the underdog in the men vs. women historical drama [arguably an advantage for men too

1254504045.0,9q95p,Members of /r/equality: It's time we have a better conversation when it comes to issues of sexual assault and rape. ,marx051,32,6,67,"Some people may be tired of the exhaustive and non-productive discussions that have come out of the many posts about sexual assault. I think it's near time that /r/equality has a huge discussion on the matter so we can all avoid the circumlocution. This is a self post to see if we can find some things we can agree on together and better understand each other.

Possible points we can all agree upon: 

* Rape and sexual assault are bad. Reducing the number of sexual assaults and false accusations is an important and tangible goal. 
* When it comes to sexual assault we must consider the victim (survivor) and the accused suspect. -We must not jump to conclusions. 
* False rape/assault claims are made. 
* Rape and assault go unreported.
* This is an issue that concerns heterosexual men, men who feel the need to prove their masculinity or women who feel the need to not be called a ""slut"" can create compromising situations. This idea is also known as the issue with men being seen as ""pimps"" or ""players"" (often positive connotation) for having multiple women while women in a similar situation are seen as ""hoes"" or ""sluts"" (often negative connotation).
* When someone discusses issues with rape and sexual assault or false claims they are not necessarily saying that ""all men are bad"" or that ""all women are liars."" Do not let assumptions stymie the conversation.  

Some questions:

* In what ways (if any) is the judicial system flawed in the process of serving justice for both the victim and suspect? 
* What do we know about statistics with sexual assault? How are they flawed or bias? For example
* What is a working definition of sexual assault/rape and how do you deal with the ""grey areas"" and consent (such as times when alcohol is present).

EDIT: I'm not sure where to go with all this information

*I am not linking or naming the post to avoid x-post drama*

Of the few responses at the time

&gt;  In my mind the damage men suffer at the reduction of their rights in certain circumstances and conditions is akin to the damage done to majority races when measures are taken to improve conditions of minority races. These things are a necessary evil. Women are judged generally better caregivers and receive custody of children more often. They are judged more often the victims of violence and law is formed around that basis. These things are terrible for some but better for most.

The closest example I have come across in my extensive reading in the field is in 1980, they have always fought against it.

So

The counter-argument seems to be mainly centered around claiming that giving such advice draws attention away from finding a solution to the real problem (rapists).  This, whereas rape is the rapist's fault.  There's also the issue that most rape is perpetrated by people known to the victim, and that it's obviously difficult to give concrete advice for such situations.

These are good arguments.

However, there are certain things people can do to prevent themselves from becoming victims.  I don't think that advising this is victim blaming.

Part of why I feel strongly about this is that I don't think rape is a special crime in this regard.  For almost everything, but this doesn't mean precautionary measures haven't prevented some crime from occurring.

Homophobia… But what’s there to fear? Fear

The fear when I tear my hand away from the person I love to avoid conflict in the street, such a part of our daily life.

But also the sadness, my happiness, my chance to stand equal in their eyes. The hate I endure each day, insults, threats, mistrust and disdain; just as we believe we are accepted, we discover that we are only just tolerated…
Whatever did we do to earn such visceral attention?

Homophobia has had its coming out party.
The ‘ordinary’ homophobia, protesting the ‘justice’ of maintaining their discrimination, against equality. “I’m not homophobic BUT…”

Do we ever speak of blackophobia or femmeophobia instead of racism or sexism? Homophobia never utters its name, one never even imagined.

That’s why tonight is all the more important. Tonight bears the warmth of a new idea whose time has come

I don't feel this way about race, straight, and cisgendered, I tend to have a lot of advantages and I can easily see how each is marginalized by society. I can easily see how it's worse to be black or Latino in a white-dominated society, it's worse to be gay in a straight-dominated society, and it's worse to be trans in a cis-dominated society.

I don't see black and white power relations with gender

I don't feel like feminism is telling the entire side of the story. For example

I read one of my textbooks in the university I go to and it started talking about privilege

I do admit

But I also see how certain MRA's can be completely dismissive of female problems within society. With the outright denial that some have that a wage gap based on any sort of discrimination exists and that feminism has reached its goal and solved all of women's problems already and that women are just happy-go-lucky compared to men.

1247923757.0,92dbz,a statement on the purpose of and expectations for this sub-reddit,ohkine,32,12,39,"Recent events have brought to light some apparent confusion with regard to the purpose of this sub-reddit and how it ought to function. Accordingly i thought it might be wise to lay down our expectations in a more official capacity — so

1\. **Gender Behaving Badly (GBB)** — GBB threads relating to either gender are not allowed under any circumstances unless that thread is used as context for a wider discussion or has some other extraordinary merit (in which case it will not be considered GBB).

Some examples of GBB threads are 'man rapes woman'; 'woman makes ridiculous alimony demand'; 'man writes offensive blog post'; 'woman does something bad but only gets &lt;insert lenient punishment&gt;'; &amp;c. These types of threads serve no purpose in the context of maintaining equality between genders

An example of a thread that is not GBB: Saydrah's [jail-time](http://www.reddit.com/r/Equality/comments/8gt6c/jail_time_in_sweden_for_repeated_rape_of_several/) post — this is not GBB because the incident (a guy raping several girls) is only used to provide *context* to a broader discussion

2\. **Call-outs** — It is not appropriate to post links to other people's offensive comments (within this sub-reddit or any other) unless they meet the same qualifications of merit that potential GBB threads do. We don't need to know every time you find a misogynistic post on reddit (or any other site for that matter).

3\. **Moderation complaints

4\. **Revenge threads** — It is not appropriate to post threads for the sole purpose of 'getting back at' other posters or threads. If you want to link something that refutes a claim or implication made by someone's thread, 'NO U', &amp;c. Obviously there will be some exceptions to this (for example, a follow-up on a post from a month ago), but i think my intent is clear here.

5\. **Other posts** — Naturally

6\. **Exceptions** — Sometimes a post that would otherwise have been banned manages to generate a lot of discussion before one of the moderators sees it. In this case we may leave it alone

7\. **Reports, &amp;c.** — Please know that reddit's spam tab is still broken, so the only way we can see reported comments/posts is to see them directly in action. Please know also that reddit does sometimes mistakenly auto-ban things (we have no control over this), and due to the same problem with the spam tab we can not see when this happens. If you feel that nobody is seeing your comments or posts, please PM us with a link to some of them so we can see if they've been banned. Finally on this subject, feel free to PM us with any problems you may have, but realise that we all have different lives

8\. **Subject matter** — This is a difficult one, this is not the divorce sub-reddit, the rape sub-reddit, the domestic-violence sub-reddit, or the interesting-behavioural-studies sub-reddit. Anything posted here should have a *direct* connection to equality.

Many of these policies are of course subjective and open to the interpretation of the mods. This is unfortunate but unavoidable

Lastly, we feel that some moderation is warranted, due to the nature of this sub-reddit. Equality is not a large general-purpose sub-reddit like Politics or News — it has a very specific goal (promoting open, civil discussions about controversial issues between 'sides' that are often strongly opposed), and without some guidance the entire conversation can be held hostage by just a few people who know the right buttons to press.",,False,t5_2qtp5,True

I'm just trying to ask a question and see what r/equality thinks as well.)

The main thing that infuriates me as an equal rights activist is the lack of true equal rights where one gender is given freedoms to do what they want while the other gets insulted for it and that the gender who gets insulted is seen as the bad person against equality.

One example that pertains to what I'm referring to is something that I've seen many times before where a woman hits a man multiple times for no good reason with intent of hurting him, I'm saying women shouldn't be able to hit men and men shouldn't be able to hit women. Nobody should be allowed to hit anyone because abuse in any form is wrong regardless of gender and in order for there to be true equal rights, both genders should be shunned for an action, not just one.
