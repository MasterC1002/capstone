I've dabbled with Linux. Tried Redhat back in the early days, but always went back to Windows because it had a polished interface and drivers that worked with my rigs. Recently, I've watched Ubuntu with great interest - it was seriously trying to create a mainstream, user friendly interface for the Average Joe. 

So this month, wireless, printer, sound, graphics... Impressive. Installed Wine and then the only windows program I actually use anymore - Scrivener - and bam. I was completely happy.  Even the Unity Desktop wasn't bad. I was using the dock on the left side of my 21""  monitor in Windows 7, so no big adjustments.

But it was just a bit laggy.

So I did some more reading and decided to try Linux mint. And I'm damn glad I did. No more lag - fast, and again, impressive.

I guess I'll be hanging around for awhile :)",,t5_2ro56,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmint/comments/14j99w/new_linux_mint_user_here_i_just_wanted_to_say_wow/

##Horrible display Bug with xserver-xorg-video-nouveau
-----


***What happens?***

Using xserver-xorg-video-nouveau and setting the dual monitor setting from mirror to span will cause the menu bar and task menu icons to fuck up horribly

***How to fix it***

Re-enable mirrored. Go to Software Sources &gt; Additional Drivers &gt; Enable nvidia-current and reboot. Use NVidia X Server tool under preferences to configure dual-display and reboot.

-----
##ALT + middle mouse no longer resizes window
-----

***What happens?***

Alt + left mouse works for moving a window. Alt + middle mouse doesn't resize windows any more.

***How to fix it***

Install and run dconf Editor. Navigate to org &gt; gnome &gt; desktop &gt; wm &gt; preferences. Set ""resize-with-right-button"" to true. You can now use the right button to resize instead of middle. Better than nothing. CTRL + ALT + Backspace to restart the session.

-----
##Key bindings refuse to stick to Super + ""x"" shortcuts
-----

***What happens?***

You use the keyboard manager to set shortcuts. It does fuck all and just ignores your settings

***How to fix it***

Install and run dconf Editor. Navigate to org &gt; cinnamon &gt; muffin &gt; keybindings. Set ""overlay-key"" to nothing (an empty string). CTRL + ALT + Backspace to restart the session.

-----
##Ubuntu One not installed by default/won't load
-----

***What happens?***

Installing ubuntu one from the software center / synaptic does nothing.

***How to fix it***

For Nadia

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntuone/stable
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ubuntuone-client ubuntuone-control-panel ubuntuone-client-proxy ubuntuone-control-panel-qt

CTRL + ALT + Backspace to restart the session. Run ""Ubuntu One"" from the preferences menu to set up the sync.

##Installing a LAMP stack doesn't actually install PHP
-----

***What happens?***

You use tasksel to install a LAMP stack. PHP is missing for no good reason other than to piss you off because it's 3am and you're tired as shit from all the overtime you've put in because some ass-hat at work keeps requesting undeliverable deliverables as you're leaving the office.

***How to fix it***

The whole LAMP stack is as follows:

    sudo apt-get install tasksel
    sudo tasksel

Select ""LAMP"" and next-next-next etc with passwords where necessary. Run this to install the missing bits and some other useful extras.

    sudo apt-get install php5 php5-gd php5-imagick php5-curl
    sudo service apache2 restart

To start out, they better provide some serious benefit.  As I see it, neither does.

That said

Gnome 3 is light-years ahead of Unity in just about every way IMHO

It isn't all bad though.  Gnome 3 is far more impressive from a visual standpoint.  But placing form before function is a path to obscurity.  Not that there isn't functionality buried beneath all that nice form, your SOL.  Here's an idea, what say we organize everything between three main menus that describe the basic functionality found within.  Something like Applications, Places and System should do it.  and If I detest the Mint Menu, what do  you suppose I make of the Gnome 3 menu?

I did like the fact that I get previews of open windows in the Gnome menu.  I would never think to look there for the previews

I certainly don't like the inability to add things to the top panel.  I like and depend on the functionality of CheckGMail.  If there was no reason to use Linux but CheckGMail

The functionality(?) behind the workspace switcher seems odd to me.  Somebody has decided that it would be nice if only one workspace was viewable until you load an application.  That somebody is wrong.  Not that it matters all that much since I couldn't click on the workspace icon and get to the workspace anyway.

Now that I feel like a curmudgeon, that will come later.  That said, MGSE in its current form only makes Gnome 3 somewhat usable.  Sometimes when something is careening toward obscurity, you should just let it go.",,False,,False,t3_mbde1

Is it fairly safe to assume we won't see Unity - or a Linux Mint version of it - or is it a real possibility? I've just got used to the awesomeness of Linux Mint which is MUCH faster than Ubuntu on my ageing Dell Inspiron 1525 and I really don't want to have to look elsewhere.

I feel like Ubuntu has forced our hand with Unity. The Ubuntu classic desktop is all good and well but we were told the 11.10 release doesn't have it and you have to use unity. I don't see that as being very friendly - more a regime and I don't want the same to happen with my newly discovered Linux Mint.

This is bad for 2 main reasons for the average user (who may not be aware of this)

1. Security : It means your running a kernel with known (and fixed)  vulnerabilities - i.e root exploit - CVE-2013-2094

2. Stability : The kernel shipped with ubuntu 13.04 (3.8.0-19-generic) (which mint is based on) has severe issues (at least with nvidia h/w)  - at the start my desktop refused to boot or shutdown correctly 50% of the time - this occured on multiple machines including my work one -

this has been fixed in the ubuntu/kubuntu kernel (3.8.0-22-generic) . however will not be for mint users (as mint doesn't update the kernel unless you explicitly tell it too..)

Linux Mint is truly the light at the end of the tunnel for Linux users. I've been using Windows for quite some time, and it's been used in my family for quite some time. The latest version at the time was Fedora 14. I was impressed with the suite of applications and the GNOME interface, but my computer didn't seem to like it. It would often crash, and it appeared there was no media codecs preinstalled in Fedora. Being an avid music listener, this was a huge problem for me, so I had to look for a new distribution.

My second try was Ubuntu. I was instantly dissatisfied with the Unity interface. It was slow and clunky and stupid. It was almost as unstable as Windows.

After a few more distributions, the rock solid stability, and the Software Center. 

The Software Center is one of the biggest things I love about LM. It's easy to use and get around. Almost every app that is available for Linux is available on the LM Software Center.

(10 cds :S i don't know why i wanted that much.) booted with it and then standard installing. 

that was even greater. 

years passed i have tried several distros, Pardus, OpenSuse, PcLinuxOs, YellowDogSomething,Slackware, Debian, Gentoo, LXDE, *box things

i settled with Linux Mint and Cinnamon/mate. i still try different distros even now i have got Elementary and Linux Mint 15 Cinnamon installed side by side. I chose Linux Mint as daily driver cause i like it. But i can't say why i don't use MS Windows (even i have a legit licence which came with my computer.) except it is closed source. 

I only use my computer to browse, e-book reading. so i really don't need any thing special as an os. i really wonder why i chose GNU/Linux.

EDIT: So here's the step by step solution I used to install the latest NVIDIA drivers.

---

Open the terminal (or press Ctrl+Alt+T to open it).

Add the following PPA:

* sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa

Then we type:

* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get upgrade

After that we install the actual driver:

* sudo apt-get install nvidia-310

And we remove the old one:

* sudo apt-get remove nvidia-current

Now reboot and it should be working.

I'm testing out Mint and I like the interface WAY more than Ubuntu. It's aesthetically pleasing and very organized. But I hate how Mint doesn't have useful tutorials like the Ubuntu website.

I started off by tweaking my processor profiles to ""performance""

I have a 6 core processor but the procedure is the same for any amount of cores but has to be repeated per core.  First you have to disable ondemand so that the preferences don't reset on reboot.  This is easily reversible and you can put everything back by doing an 'enable'

    sudo update-rc.d ondemand disable

From there you have to manually edit the contents of the core profile.  I prefer to do this from the command line.  This will depend on how many processors you have and will need to be repeated for each core.  First check what you have now.

    cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor

It should say ondemand.

    cd /sys/devices/system/cpu
    ls

This will show you how many cores you have and need to be changed.

    echo /cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governer &gt; performance

repeat this command replacing the first directory with subsequent cpu's

**If you don't run an Nvidia card  STOP HERE

Next we want a faster kernel.  3.8.27 isn't too bad but it's not the new hotness nor is it custom hotness.  We want the 3.10-pf kernel.  Easy peasy.  More info here.  http://pf.natalenko.name/

First we need to add a repository.  Click your update manager icon and in the menu select software sources.  Then select add repository.  Add this line.

    deb http://repos.natalenko.name/ubuntu/ pf/

Now refresh your source lists

You can either patch the nvidia driver yourself based on the instructions from the Slackware forums

https://mega.co.nz/#!x4IzkAqD!eTpCxU4bPcGKRLsNuthtJmISlGd6XH-18n6C8p-gjf4

This is the 64 bit version... if you are not using the x64 bit version of Mint

Now that you have the driver.  Right click on it and make sure it's executable.  Also make sure that you are currently using an Nvidia driver **and not noveau**.  I screwed up and tried to install this over noveau... it was a royal pain in the ass.  If you start with one of the distro Nvidia drivers it will save you A LOT OF HASSLE.

Drop to a shell... you might want to write this down unless you are familiar with the process.

    ctrl + alt + F1
    login
    navigate to the directory you downloaded the driver to.

    sudo service mdm stop  (mdm is used in kde but use the window manager appropriate for your version)
    ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-319.32.patched.run

Follow the prompts.  I'd suggest not installing dkms to avoid potential issues but it's your discression.

Once it is complete.  Reboot.  **Congratulations

Start to boot up Windows8, and turn off Secure-Boot.  Then proceed to the Boot-Options screen and turn on CSM temporarily so that we can boot using the normal MBR type of boot-system.  On the same screen (on Acer) check the order of boot devices, we want to give USB keys and/or CD/DVD devices priority over the hard drive. Also ensure that the boot-menu is enabled, otherwise you won't be able to select the USB key to boot from and therefore you won't be able to boot into anything else but Windows.  Save and exit.


When you've opened Windows


[Handy Hint: Because of the way the original hard-drives are produced and supplied in your OEM machine, but are all compacted better and you will usually be able to condense the C: partition very easily.  So delete your C: partition (if you're brave enough &lt;grin&gt;) and use your Windows Recovery Disks to get back to a Factory-Defaults install of the machine. If you're even braver, you can adjust the Recovery Disk files to partition the Windows partitions to your desired sizes on recovery.]


At this point I use Gparted Live CD and an external USB hard-drive to back-up all those Windows partitions as belt-and-braces. You should already have made your Windows Recovery System disks anyway. These were my original hard-drive partitions


original clean Windows 8:

      Partition Table: gpt
      
      Number  Start   End     Size    File system  Name                                 Flags

Fast Summary: 

Shrink C: partition to your taste. I cut mine back all the way to just 50Gig.  I kept a very small D: partition just as a place-keeper to keep all the Windows partitions in the same relative positions.  I sometimes move /dev/sda6, swap of course, a separate /home so I can just carry over everything to a new distro if required (not too big a /home directory, it's just for day-to-day work), then a large separate storage partition for long-term files/archives.


Then proceed to the Boot-Options screen and turn CSM off again so that we can't boot using the normal MBR type of boot-system. On the same screen (on Acer) confirm that the boot-menu is enabled


Save and exit. The machine will now reboot using EFI *only* and restricts you to only booting up Windows and other EFI systems.


At the Acer logo and beep


Install normally. When you get to the 'Installation Type' page


With my install, so I was unable to boot Windows. Fixing the boot-up is the purpose of 'boot-repair'. So I downloaded the boot-repair package(s) with these commands:


       # sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get update
       # sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair &amp;&amp; boot-repair

Anyways, it appears to. I just installed LM14 into my LVM (basic setup, ext3 /boot partition also on LVM) and the install went great. However, upon reboot, no combination of voodoo and finger-crossing can get any reaction from my machine when I try to boot Mint.


It'll still boot into my non-Mint OSes just fine, or try installing 14 into an LVM yet that might be able to shed some light? At least with 14RC, I was able to get it to mostly boot, before locking up... but with the final release, I get nothing.

EDIT: I'm a dunce. I assumed (foolishly) that since the new installer supports installation onto LVM partitions that it would install lvm2 by default. So to anyone else who wants to through LM14 onto an LVM

My usb wifi card isn't being blocked by rfkill, using the rt2800usb kernel module.

Is there any way to get NetworkManager working with my card? Or will I just have to keep NetworkManager disabled and continue using wpa_supplicant? It'd just be nice to have the convenience and flexibility back with NetworkManager and not have to set every wifi network up manually. Any help is appreciated.

I grabbed the 64-bit iso with Cinnamon. I mounted it onto a flash drive, and having to turn it off before trying, but I poked around in my BIOS settings, and saw none. 

I plugged in the flash drive, my screen goes black, and it appears that my laptop went into sleep mode, except I can't hit a key or touch the mouse to bring it back to life. Nothing. I tried looking on Google, but there didn't seem to be an answer, or I wasn't searching properly.

Following advice I've seen elsewhere for older versions, sadly) and then performed an Xorg -configure, then copied the newly created xorg.conf into /etc/X11 and rebooted.

It will come up fine and dandy once. I rebooted

Throughout the evening, ending in a repeating series of ""device not ready"" errors), activating the ""proprietary drivers,"" and flat-out deleting xorg.conf and rebooting.

It ends in one of three states: a single ""working"" boot, weirdly, a ""dead secondary monitor"" boot. The last one looks totally normal on my primary (X loads, GUI comes up, I login, etc.), but my secondary monitor seems to have a huge grey ""box"" pasted over the desktop (this happens whether I mirror or not). I can just barely see the cursor if I move it to the very top of the screen, but the rest is flat grey.

Installing the proprietary drivers ended worse than most attempts, but the behavior returned.

I do nothing else unusual in my setup. It's being installed on a working drive that's partitioned to give Linux about 40 gigs, and it's succeeded quite recently, filling most of the remaining space, so it's unlikely the drive is bad. SMART data agrees).

It's a relatively modern PC--AMD Phenom II X4 945 (3.0ghz, and an ATI Radeon HD6870 1GB PCI Express Card. All hardware appears functional and Windows 7 is able to boot and use both monitors with ease.

This has been the simplest distro to set up. I love how the update manager protects me from my stupidity. This does not mean that I am an idiot that doesn't know how to use a computer. I just want to be able to use the computer for things that I need to and have the operating system take care of the rest. A few days ago in Ubuntu I did an upgrade that messed up my resolution. The forums had me digging though xorg.conf. I never got it figured out. What I like about Linux Mint is that it doesn't expect you to know how to do that. If I wanted a complex distro I would have complied everything from source. I want to use my computer, and came back to simplicity. I am just at the point where I want to be able to use Linux, stay up to date, and not have to spend 6 hours trying to fix my computer after something breaks it. Linux Mint does this.

Now I presume you tried to play a song and a dialog box appeared saying something along the lines of 

    ""[song] was unable to play because the decoder (MPEG-4 AAC decoder) can not be found""

This just means that you are missing a few codecs

The process for fixing this is simple and can be broken into 3 steps:
_________________________________________________________________________________________
1. Check that you have gstream-ffmpeg (Normally comes default w/ install). Easiest way to do this is open up a terminal and type:

         sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg     
     This will will install it you don't have it
_________________________________________________________________________________________
2. In the same terminal window

          whereis songbird
This should be something like ""/usr/bin/songbird /usr/bin/X11/songbird""
copy to the ""best"" location
_________________________________________________________________________________________
3. In the terminal type:
    
        sudo gedit /usr/bin/songbird

This will open a script file. Once there add the following after the last export line:

    export SB_GST_SYSTEM=1

Save and exit

4. plug ethernet cable back in.
5. note that network connection is not automatically connected.
6. reboot a second time and log in to verify that probing during boot works and restores ethernet connection.

* Batteries: Main battery and bay battery which yields about 5 hours of runtime total (3.5 with just the main)
* Memory: 544MB PC100
* Network: Came with just a modem
* Processor: Went from a PII 400 or 450 (I forget) to a PIII-650 (which runs at 500 because I haven't hardware-locked it yet)

That last point is where the twist comes in. Due to this machine never being intended for a PIII at all the BIOS doesn't recognize it and therefore doesn't enable the L2 cache. This would make it next to worthless because it would be painfully slow at everything... not that it's a speed demon now but it's at least usable. I've got a hacked version of Grub on there that enables the cache and it *needs* to stay there.

Is there a way to upgrade the system to Mint 11 LXDE live without hosing everything up?

Suggestions to get a new laptop will be downvoted and ignored unless they also include a proffer of paying for it. *(but if someone does they can have the Thinkpad! And its floppy drive too!)*

1359507953.0,17j579,Linux Mint 14 won't boot after install on completely blank hard drive,thomasamadeusking,2,1,1,"Hey all

So I need some help. I've tried three different installs now of Mint 14 - Xfce, a 1TB mechanical that's formatted NTFS for files, and the 1TB mechanical that I'm trying to install Mint on. I've tried literally every possible way to install it, and every time there's no way for me to boot into it.

If I keep my other two drives connected and tell the installer to install alongside Windows, with no sight of GRUB or any other boot-loader.

If I keep the other two drives connected and tell the installer exactly how I want everything partitioned (making sure to set aside space for a /boot directory, and root) on my third drive, same thing. And when I go into my BIOS and tell it to boot from that disk, I get the following error:

""Reboot and Select proper Boot device
or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key.""

When I press a key

If I UNPLUG my other two drives, or manually partition it, when I restart I see that same error (only it just keeps repeating after I press a key since my windows installation isn't connected to the system anymore).

I really have no idea what to do. I've installed Mint 14 on my laptop using several of the above approaches, ideas, or sympathy will be greatly appreciated.
