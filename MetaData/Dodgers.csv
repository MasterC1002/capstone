You guys have a really swell subreddit here, and everything will take care of itself.  You guys have too good of a lineup not to be successful.  I miss Adrian.  He's good.  And Houston Street is a home run allowing bitch who really shouldn't be closing for us, so i guess that something that you guys relish on.  Vin Scully has an angelic voice and I sometimes watch Dodger streams instead of ours when we play you guys for the sake of him (shhhh).  Ugh what else can I say?  Puig is the Cuban Jesus?  At least we didn't lose the series to y'all.  Good luck in the future.  Peaceeee",,False,self,t5_2ra0i,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dodgers/comments/1gxmyd/padres_fan_here_holding_up_my_end_of_the_bet/

Shortly after this nutty run began, the likely best case scenario is that I'll have to live the rest of my life with medication.  Worst case scenario is that I'm headed to organ transplantville and my lifespan just got drastically reduced. 

Before this, this has been pretty heavy.  You guys have no idea how this run and /r/dodgers has helped keep my spirits up.  Instead of panicking and losing my shit, I spend a lot of time reading every news article and blog post out there about the Dodgers.  The goofy bullshit posts here have been essential in helping me laugh.

So, maybe not, but you guys are pretty damn important.

1373484467.0,1i109e,The study of the rise and fall of Puigmania throughout MLB,Dinosauringg,58,11,39,"June 3rd, and for a week almost everyone is baseball is engulfed in the hype and great start. 

But a week later

It goes completely against all logic, but for Yasiel Puig, he stayed hot, and he stayed superhuman, but quickly much of the baseball world had it's fill. A world that was once watching with eyes wide the home run races of the 90's was growing tired of a phenom that exceeded expectations. The conversations went from ""He's hot, and exciting, but don't expect this all year"" to ""He's going to fall and I don't expect him to hit above .270.""

Despite hitting over .400 through almost the full month of June

Even though it's now been a little over a month and he's started to walk and steal while retaining his other skills (and his .400+ BA) baseball fans expect him to be little more than Jeff Francouer. 

But why do people hate him just a few weeks after loving him? People will point to jealousy

They're upset that he hasn't died out. He's still making highlight plays and multi-hit games. He's still stealing bases.

They're upset that his clubhouse loves him. The man was supposed to have attitude issues

They're upset that he isn't the villain

He ignored Luis Gonzales, a team that has trash talked his, full of stars who taunt opposing players more than any other team. It's no wonder he doesn't enjoy the company of a team that called his pitcher chicken shit and finger wagged him twice, or a team that threw at his pitchers head and complained when he wasn't suspended. 

It's weird that major league fans can be so fickle when nothing has changed. The same fans that watched,False,self,t5_2ra0i,False,,22,t3_1i109e

the fact that it came down to the second to last game for the Dodgers speaks to how hard they played. the Giants took a number of significant knocks (injuries, etc). but with Kemp's injuries and other stuff you guys had your own problems to overcome.

the trading of sweeps was pretty amazing and I think the rivalry brings out the best in our respective teams just as

And I didn't really care much even then.....but just imagine him looking like a star on a field of All-Stars? Imagine him hitting the game winning homer? Imagine if the Dodgers made the playoffs and used that home field advantage?  

All of this is crazy to say

As of June 23

The third spot

How much can /r/dodgers contribute to his total? 500

I'm going to assume that half of us participate...that's 1650 fans voting.  

Now,500 votes. That's a huge chunk. I'll be using more than 10 accounts myself.  

The whole stuffing the box is kind of lame....but when the Giants are trying to vote in every single position

The Dodgers are feeding off his energy. The kid deserves it. Let's do this. ",self,t5_2ra0i,False,,Kemp,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dodgers/comments/1h9fq9/lets_end_the_debate_there_are_3299_of_us_letrs/

In addition, and they have done a fantastic job with the design and look of the page. They've added the banner, upcoming and recent schedule, and the standings to the page, cleaned up and added tons of relevant links to the sidebar, added copious amounts of options for flair and turned upvotes to upVins and downvotes to downBarrys. They added official game chat threads to keep us all talking and together. They don't tolerate the douchebags that give our fan base a bad name and openly welcome any fan to participate in our threads. All the aesthetic changes took place in the course of a few months, and they've all done an amazing job in regards to that and everything else. A tip of my hat to all of you.

No matter the outcome, my favorite subreddit of them all.

1361152001.0,18q2xn,Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw now the best starting pitching duo in baseball - ESPN Insider,RanByMyGun,42,6,7,"When the Los Angeles Dodgers signed Zack Greinke this offseason

Are they the best in the game? I decided to pore through some advanced metrics (and sprinkle in a little subjectivity) to determine the top five duos in the game right now.

To determine these rankings, which has just finished running over at FanGraphs.

I also took the combined WAR (FanGraphs' version) of each duo for the past three seasons. I use three seasons

However, such as strikeouts and walks, often hold a great deal of predictive value, but rather than dividing them by each other, as K/BB does, it's better to subtract the two percentages from each other. This not only gives it more predictive value (which you can read more about), but it also makes more sense intuitively, check scroll to the bottom.)

Finally, but projects Kershaw to toss 221 2/3, a large difference. Therefore, we'll use the ZiPS projected ERA for each duo. By using all four of these metrics, we can get a more complete picture of how the duos have performed, and how they may be expected to perform.

Here are the top five pitching duos in baseball right now:

1. Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke

Indeed

Like the Phillies, giving him an exemplary track record. It's that track record that makes him more bankable than Scherzer or Strasburg, who have just a single season of domination under their belts. And while Kershaw didn't match his brilliant 2011 season in the same fashion that Verlander did, he joins Verlander as one of two pitchers to notch a WAR projection north of six wins.

The Dodgers have the best balance of past track record and future projection, they are going to be tough to beat.

.2. Cliff Lee and Cole Hamels

You could make the argument that Roy Halladay deserves to be placed here rather than Hamels, as among the No. 2 starters as defined by this exercise, only Mat Latos has a higher projected WAR for 2013.

Lee and Hamels form the most efficient pairing. Both rarely waste bullets, they have been the most valuable duo, and there is little reason to expect much of a drop-off this season. Lee received attention for his drop in wins last season, but if there's any reason for worry among Phillies fans, it's that both his K-rate and swinging strike percentage fell last season. But he also was able to limit his walks more, which dampened most of the negative effect.

.3. Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer

Last season was Scherzer's coming-out party, opposing hitters were only able to connect on 74 percent of Scherzer's pitches in 2012, a number that was good for fourth in the game among qualified starters.

As for Verlander, few are going to do it better than Verlander, who ZiPS projects to have the most WAR among starting pitchers this season.

.4. Gio Gonzalez and Stephen Strasburg

Strasburg is at once the reason to be wary and optimistic for the Nationals. There isn't a starter in baseball who has a better FIP- projection than Strasburg's 58 FIP- heading into this season. But Strasburg also has the thinnest track record

As a result, who made a lot of strides last season but still walked batters at a rate above that of league average. The two may top this chart a year from now, but at the moment it is prudent to exercise a little caution.

.5. Jered Weaver and C.J. Wilson

Weaver and Wilson have been very productive over the past three years

Collectively, he does a poor job of keeping the ball on the ground, but thanks to his ballpark and outfield defense, this isn't the issue for him that it would be on a different team.

Judging will be completely unfair and biased... meaning we'll pick the one we like the best ;) or if there are more than one that stick out, if all we get are images of Juan Pierre, we'll forget this ever happened :)

**To enter

**Requirements:**

- There must be a blank-ish space on the left side large enough for Snoo (the reddit alien) to fit in. He's a separate image that sit on top of the header.
- It should fade to a solid color, and if you have a huge monitor, an abruptly cut image looks tacky.
- It should be around 170 pixels tall

**Prizes are...** hmm. Credit for your contribution, there might even be a physical prize of some sort!

**Tips:**

- Use your browser's developer tools to insert your image as the header here to see how it'll look.
- Score more runs than your opponents. Oh wait
- Have fun (ya

1369932801.0,1fcgmb,Clayton Kershaw projected by ESPN to win the most games this season (20 games) [ESPN Insider],BaronVonChang,36,4,18,"Unlike home runs and stolen bases and most offensive statistics, strikeout rate and more

So it is that I'll take a shot at predicting the final leaderboard in pitchers' wins. I know it's silly, with home runs and stolen bases already off the board. This will not be a ranking of Player Rater value, but rather just wins, and hopefully this will give you an idea of which pitchers I like more than others. 


* 1 (tie) Clayton Kershaw, and I see him becoming more fortunate in the wins category as the season progresses and his team modestly improves.


* #1 (tie) Yu Darvish, too! He gets plenty of run support, and as we've seen, he's capable of pitching deeper into games. I say Darvish wins the strikeout title as well. 


* 3 Adam Wainwright, but more important, he should reach 230 innings again. More innings, more shots for wins. 


* 4(tie) Matt Moore, there's room for improvement. I'm selling high on Corbin, but not so much with Moore. 


* 4 (tie) Jordan Zimmermann, so while his xFIP tells us regression is ahead, he'll keep winning games for a team that is about to take off. 


* 4 (tie) Lance Lynn


* 4 (tie) Jon Lester, however, is much improved. This gift will keep on giving, and he'll win more than talented teammate Clay Buchholz. 


* 8 (tie) Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander, but I say they end up in the same place for the eventual AL Central champs. 


* 8 (tie) CC Sabathia and Hiroki Kuroda, but he's pitching better than last season, when he was healthy enough to win 16 games. 


Best of the rest: There's nothing wrong with Corbin, unless you think Heath Bell is reliable. … The nightmare second half for Justin Masterson last season (5.60 ERA) is still on my mind. … I thought about Chicago White Sox lefty Chris Sale and right-hander Jake Peavy, but isn't it wishful thinking to expect more than 30 starts for each? … Like the White Sox, New York Mets ace Matt Harvey pitches for a below-average team, and while not every guy on a bad team fails to win, it's also tough to expect Harvey to keep his ERA this low for six months. He might not even get the chance to pitch regularly in September. … As for Mr. Hamels, all he needs to do is see how many wins Cliff Lee earned in 2012, I say Lee wins 15 this year. … I want to pick James Shields to win in the high-teens,False,

Let's be honest
we all had a blast at the mega meetup (except the those who couldn't make it)

Since our meetup
so here's my idea

I think one word I had in mind was 'family'.  

the rough idea is this

- picnic/pot luck BBQ at the park (BYOB and BOYM)
- chill
- game at 6pm

this means
Good thing is


to make sure to have as many people as possible at the meet up

what do you guy think?
