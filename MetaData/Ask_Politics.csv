I don't dislike the fellow

Next Wednesday

There's a couple reasons for doing this:

1) I want HD136 to be competitive, to have better name recognition, and get his name out there.  

2) I want to raise awareness of proportional representation though the [Single Transferable Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote), we can have a referendum in 2018, and if that passes, use Single Transferable Vote in 2020, after the census.  

The reason for this latter is that throughout Texas's history, for other reasons too lengthy to go into here, I believe that PR systems like STV provide a disincentive for corruption that our current system lacks.  

3) I have been diagnosed with High Functioning Autism (I'm certainly somewhere on the ""spectrum.""); I want to raise awareness that ""autistic kids"" eventually become autistic adults - that we may be a little strange and quirky

If I win the primary

Because of gerrymandering

We just had a meeting with our insurance broker and he gave us the rates for next year.  In average

Right now, you pay nothing for the lowest tier of health insurance.  It's a pretty standard managed care HMO plan and almost all employees are covered minus a few that opt out for whatever reason (spouse or parent coverage usually).

However, with a decrease in sales and this increased cost, we ran a small loss last year.

Now

Is this happening to most plans?  I heard increases were coming due to the added of costs from the removal of per-existing conditions and caps but this seems excessive.  I thought that the mandate was going to absorb some of this increased cost.  

We're at a loss of what to do

So as a under 50 person company,000 a year!   This is almost double what I pay a year in mortgage and escrow.

I did some Googling last night and it sound like the exchanges are not operational until October and they might miss that date.  That doesn't leave us much of a window.  If we don't see what the exchange options are until November and we need sign to renew in December.   I do understand the cynicism but we really are trying to figure out a real solution.  We do believe our employees deserve insurance and want to provide it to them.  We're open to compensating them to purchase an individual plan or a group plan.  We just need to do it where health insurance doesn't become our third largest expense in the company eroding our ability to grow or even in most scenarios not lose money.

Here's what I have deigned from this discussion. ""Liberty too must be limited in order to be possessed"" - Edmund Burke, this is because the people are too easily swayed by too many factors to be relied upon to elect an effective ruling party. PoliSciUgGuy explains the premise better and has provided a link http://www.volokh.com/2013/07/05/restricting-democracy-in-order-to-protect-other-liberal-values/. Thirdly the fact that the people's power is limited leaves government more susceptible to other forms of manipulation the most evident being big business, however this is preferable to many other possible influencing factors because this particular influence relies largely upon the approval of the product and in a less direct way is also subject to public opinion. This seems to create a triumvirate where the people have as much power as anywhere else but are often unaware, I think perhaps the only thing required to make the system more viable is to make them more aware of exactly what factors influence their government and then they can also willfully regulate them.

I believe they will hold the House, but they won't take the Senate.  2016 might be a repeat of their 2012 horror if Hillary is sufficiently rehabilitated by then as I don't see a Republican that might be able to challenge her and the Democrat's resources.

I believe further, frankly, moronic.  I'll just take this sequester as an example, using it to writ large.

* Obama has been saying that the sequester is a bad idea
* Boehner replied in this [WSJ Op-Ed (might hit a paywall)](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323495104578314240032274944.html) that this was Obama's fault

Stop and look at that - Boehner just agreed with 90% of Obama's premise!  So now he gives Obama the opening and loses much of his position; Obama can merely say that Boehner is willing to damage the country if he can't get differing cuts... and then fall back into the class warfare that Boehner wants to cut Medicare and Social Security

I think the problem Republicans are facing is a matter of leadership

It is my opinion that if the Republicans could select a leader who would do one or the other, the next they are trying to compromise and settle.  Their own bases don't know which Republicans are going to show up and what principles they will sell out this time.  The fact that they don't seem to have a lick of political logic doesn't help either, as I pointed out above.

If you're a voter, pieces fall where they may.  I think, further, it might well take three or four cycles for Republicans to get to this point, not necessarily purges but rather for the public outside of its base to trust it enough to get back the White House.

I do not think anyone has actually attempted to provide a history of small-arms development

There are a few points I would like to make to hopefully educate some of those that are unfamiliar with small-arms history. 

* **An overview and timeline of how modern firearms have developed.**


* **The United States has a history of modern firearms readily available to civilians.**


 **Overview of Small-arms Development since 1770**

**1775-ish**
The Continental Army was armed with a hodge-podge of rifles and muskets in 1775. The difference between the two was that a musket consisted of a tube (barrel) that took a loosely fitting ball and fired it innaccurately, where the term 'rifle' comes from). The rifle was more accurate than the musket, and allowed rifleman to target individual soldiers or officers with a reasonable degree of sucess; However, it was faster to load and fire a smoothbore musket, and could be fired for a longer period of time in a prolonged battle. (Blackpowder leaves a residue in the barrel that would build up in rifles/muskets, and make it difficult to stuff the ball down the barrel.) Basically, a rifle was more useful at longer distances, you would have probably been better off with a musket.

**Civil War**
Let's fast-forward to the American Civil War. There are a few things we need to cover. The [Minie Ball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minie_Ball), [repeating rifles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_repeating_rifle), and [revolving pistols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver).

The Minie Ball was a football shaped projectile that worked very well in rifles, and in any weather. Percusion caps provided much more instaneous ignition of the black-powder, and did away with the very large flash-fire that was near a persons eye when they were firing. Accurate rifle fire was now posible out to 1000 yards, and ""sharpshooting"" began to take much more notoriety during the Civil War.

Metal cartidges allowed firearms to be loaded even quicker than muzzle-loading rifles, it was not uncommon for a solider to forget to remove the old percussion cap on the nipple of his rifle, and put a new one on; as a result, a soldier would put new powder and bullet on top of the old one, and if they did this a few times, and then remembered to put a cap on, it could blow the rifle up! Metal cartridges and single-shot rifles simplified the loading process to simply putting a cartridge in, and pulling the trigger. Another advantage that metal cartidge cases provides was allowing the soldier to load and fire from a prone (laying down) position instead of kneeling or standing to load the rifle; it may not seem like much

Repeating rifles like the Spencer rifle (the one in the link) allowed soldiers to fire more shots before having to reload, and a revolver would have given him another 6 (or 12 if he had two), as well as a saber that was effective at close range or off horseback. With this kind of firepower at their disposal, a calvary unit could flank, and quickly subdue a much larger fighting force armed with muzzle loading rifles.

Following the Civil War, the utility of each was dependent upon the situation; one of the many reasons that Custer was over-run at the Battle of the Little Big Horn was because the Sioux had some lever-action repeating rifles, and were able to close the distance between them and the 7th Calvary, and exploit their close range firepower.

**World War I**
The time between the Civil War and World War I saw more improvements in firearms; the development of [smokeless powder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokeless_powder) that could drive bullets faster than blackpowder, [automatic rifles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_rifle), and [submachine guns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submachine_gun)

Smokless powder greatly reduced the smoke signature that a soldier produced when firing his rifle; it also pushed bullets a lot faster than blackpowder in a smaller package, allowed rifles to be even more effective at longer ranges.

Bolt-action repeating rifles like the [Gewhr 98](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gewehr_98#M_98_controlled-feed_bolt-action_system) that could fire the new cartridges that were much more effective at longer-ranges

Machine guns like the [Maxim gun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_gun) that fired the newer cartridges made it much easier for entrenched armies to hold ground against infantry and calvary charges; when coupled with a knowledge of trajectories (the arc the bullet flies)

Much of the focus during World War I was trying to find ways to overcome the stalemate that machine guns, efforts were focused on developing weapons that allowed infantry to gain ground again;  light machine guns, automatic rifles, and submachine guns, guns were developed in an effort to allow infantry to gain and hold ground again. 

Light machine guns were simply designed to be mobile machine guns

Automatic rifles were typically fed by a detachable magazine, and fire a shot every time the left foot struck the ground, and create a wall of lead that would kill the germans...needless to say, it was not a very good idea. As a result, the automatic rifles were used much in the same way a light-machine gun would be; to bring an increased amount of firepower against the enemy, and allow rifleman to advance.

Submachine guns fired a pistol cartridge out of a detachable magazine

It would not be until World War II that they would their worth when coupled with tanks

**World War II**

World War II was fought with much of the same technology as the First World War, and tanks could be massed at a single point, and then punch through a defensive line, surround it, and cut off it's supplies.

Most of Europe went to war with the same bolt-action rifles it had carried in World War I, and automatic rifles. Infantry tactics were focused on how to strike a balance between short-range firepower and long range accuracy, as well as having the foot soliders be able to keep up with and support the tanks.

The United States entered World War II with the [M1 Garand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Garand) which was a semi-automatic rifle that increased the firepower of the infantry rifleman without having to sacrifice the range or accuracy of a bolt-action rifle. Towards the end of the War

The most notable firearms advance came in the form of the Assault Rifle. The idea behind the Assault Rifle was to combine all of the best aspects of a submachine gun, and develop a weapon that was more suitable for fast-paced warfare. The German [FG42](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FG42) was an early attempt at an Assault rifle, but was not much more useful than a semi-automatic rifle because it used a full-power rifle cartridge which has too much recoil to be effective in a lightweight rifle. 

The next attempt at an assault rifle (and where the namesake comes from) was the Stg.44; the Stg.44 has all of the hallmarks of what makes an assault rifle an assault rifle; it was select fire, so it could be fired semi-automatic (one shot at a time) or full-auto (bunches of shots per trigger pull). Basically, the Assault Rifle sacrificed the extreme-range of the full powered rifle cartridge for some of the short range utility of the submachine gun; it was intended to be a much more useful weapon in a mobile war where accurate long range rifle fire was not as useful.

**Vietnam**

The United States fought the Korean War was fought with the same firearms that were used in World War II; it would not be until Vietnam that the United States would have a real Assault Rifle.

Following World War II, but also wanted something in a rifle-sized package that could be used as an automatic rifle, rifle, and submachine gun. The full powered rifle cartridge made it uncontrollable in full-automatic fire, and as a result, it was really only an adequate replacement for the semi-automatic M1 Garand rifle.

The [M16 rifle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M16_rifle) is the only true assault rifle adopted by the United States

Except for some major snafus (the rifle was hastily adopted

**Vietnam-Now**

Following Korean War, there has been a reversal of that trend on some levels; the intermediate cartridge that the M16 fires is not very useful for long range engagements. In the mountains of Afghanistan, this has became fairly apparent, and rifles have been issued to fill the long-range engagement niche. Even the discarded M14 rifles saw a comeback as a Designated Marksman rifle.

The main advancement in the infantry soldiers area has came in the form of rugged telescopic sights

**Modern Firearms in Civilian Hands**

People that are advocates for an ""Assault Weapons Ban"" believe that military weapons should not be in the hands of civilians, there was no attempt to discourage Americans from using the latest and greatest firearms.

The long-range single-shot rifles that were used by hunters following the Civil War to slaughter buffallo were identical in function and capability to the single-shot rifles that were issued to Custers calvary. Lever-action repeating rifles

The bolt-action repeating rifles that many envision when they think of a 'hunting rifle' mimmick the bolt-action repeating rifles of World War I. The companies the produced bolt-action rifles for World War I produced the same rifles for civilian purposes on the same equipment, only 3 years after the 30-06 cartridge was adopted.

It wasn't until the [National Firearms Act of 1934](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Firearms_Act) that any widespread attempt was made to regulate what was available to civilians. The NFA was spurred on by highly reported events like the St. Valentines Day Massacre, as well as the portrayal of ""Gangsters"" in Hollywood. The reality is that machine guns were not the weapons of choice for criminals of the time; yet the tommy gun has became iconic of the prohibition/depression era. The NFA made it harder for people to aquire automatic weapons, short-barrelled shotguns, and suppressors by imposing a $200.00 excise tax, as well as getting approval from a local law enforcement officer in order to own an item that fell under the NFA.

Following World War II

Semi-automatic hunting rifles introduced after World War II

Colt began selling a semi-automatic AR15 to civilians in 1962 after the AirForce had adopted it; but it wouldn't be until 1967 that the AR15 was standardized as the M16A1 by the US Army.

In 1994, and inflated the role that these types of rifles had in the overall picture of gun crime, or violent crime in general. 

Probably the most blatant/obvious/daming instance of the United States has to do with how formal target shooting, Theodore Roosevelt created the National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice, and the Director of Civilian Marksmanship in 1906.

The whole purpose of the DCM was the promotion of Civilian Marksmanship using current service rifle of the time

The National Matches were also established in 1906 as part of the DCM, and smallbore pistol matches.

Currently, and is put on by the Civilian Marksmanship Program (the DCM was privatized in 1996). By far the biggest crowd turns out for the Service Rifle competition (around 1400 shooters). Every year, the Army runs the [Small Arms Firing School](http://www.odcmp.com/NM/SAFS.htm) at the National Matches, and trains civilian and military shooters alike on the same M16 rifles that have been issued overseas.

 Assault weapons such as the semi-auto AR-15 are not battle rifles such as the automatic M-15. A weapon like an AR-15 is the modern day weapon of civil defense when local law enforcement breaks down.  For example, or mob like violence most likely in a time of civil duress. I find it sensible that a rural has a strong affinity for the right to bear arms because local law enforcement response times are higher.  I've heard that in Argentina, when civil order broke down it was the rural areas that saw the most heinous crimes as criminals need to concern themselves with a law enforcement response.  I think urban areas in the US are less familiar civil unrest or environmental disaster simple because it occurs less frequently but when it does occur it affects large numbers of people.

Its even more fun when it creates contradictory views *in the same person*.  For example

This is one of those cases that does that.  On the one hand, income taxes, etc.

But on the other hand, you must report it to the state and pay the sales tax.  This is because, again I presume, most statutes, the sales tax is the responsibility of the purchaser.  It is only collected by the seller for ease of collection.  So the other side of me says that we should not allow the Internet Sales Tax and simply force the government to go after citizens.

Wyoming (the least populous state, while Montana (population 1,000,000) also has only one. That's twice the population with only half the influence. Then there is Washington D.C. with about 600,000 residents and no representation in the house.

Of course each state is guaranteed at least one congressional representative, held that the population differences among Georgia's congressional districts were so great as to violate the Constitution).

Why not guarantee one representative to a contiguous geographical area not limited by state boundaries? I think this would solve the problem of ""Constitutional Malapportionment"" and give representation to D.C. residents.

Problem is who would draw these districts? It would no longer be left up to the states. If Congress was in charge of drawing their own districts this could lead to some major gerrymandering. 

The Voting Rights Act does not prohibit states from redistricting as they please and when they please. Gerrymandering is legal as long as the district is contiguous

In my opinion Gerrymandering is an ugly thing. I don't want to see it continue and I would hate to see it implemented in a unbound district based purely on population.

From the sounds of things, and people were working full time, they simply cut peoples hours back further.

The problem is, that are now told they may not work full time and their health care plan has been taken away. Then, with the mandate coming into effect soon, they're afraid that in addition to less work and no health coverage that they want, they'll have to pay a fine for not being insured.

**Problem 2** : It is also illegal for the Canadian government to spy on Canadian citizens.

**Legal Fact 1** : It is not illegal for the US intelligence services to spy on Canadian citizens.

**Legal Fact 2** : It is not illegal for Canadian intelligence services to spy on US citizens.

Anyways while surfing the web I noticed a lot of, trivia, ect. And it got me thinking... Some of these polls have quite a few voters, why do we not use a more direct way of connecting politics to the average American citizen?

I can understand that when America was originally founded, city, and so forth. But what I don't understand is that we no longer live way back in the day and yet we operate the same way. I have to hope that my 1 representative of my state or county is going to vote the way I would vote every conflict of issue that arises or when passing new things into law. Which I find ridiculous. Especially considering how corrupt the old outdated system is now. 

Back in the day it would take a ridiculous amount of time for people to travel to one location or to all cast paper votes about every little thing that went through congress. And we have come some ways now with technology that have helped us and the current system. But why have we not gone much much farther?

The way I see it we should throw out our old corrupt congress bastards and move towards allowing the choices that are made within this country to be made by this country's people themselves. Have a central government website that allows anyone with valid citizenship to take polls in everything or anything that effects them or their family in any way. It's not as hard to vote anymore as It was back in the day, however if everyone in the city is allowed to look in on the case and make a personal decision on what they feel should be done and vote on a simple quick multi choice poll it will take a large majority to screw with anything.

This wouldn't even create a job crisis. People will now be needed to help format these polls and help choose what the four or more options to vote on in the poll should be.

Anyways the main thing I'm getting as is why are we not moving towards a more accessible government if in fact we have become a more accessible society?

This creates an accessible threshold for people to use in terms of classifying income brackets.

Before reading on

The futuristic governing system in place in the book relies heavily on the idea of franchise. Heinlein defines it as the right to influence the collective, civilians, those who have not, and the service members who will earn their citizenship and franchise upon retirement. The system mirrors America’s currently in that is an open democracy, with the right to earn franchise not limited to anyone based on creed, color, sex, with only a small portion actually involved in combat arms. The rest is a huge bureaucracy filled with volunteers working in a specialized service field. 

If one is soldierly, they might work in the postal service. If a blind person applies, they might be sent to Antarctica to count the hairs on the backs of caterpillars by touch for their term, all that matters is that at some point, every citizen stood up and said that the good of the collective was worth more than my own personal well-being. One is free to quit their training or their service at any time (unless in the face of the enemy), free of consequence, if they decide that franchise is not worth the sacrifice. There is no effort to hunt down deserters, they cannot reapply for their franchise by rejoining the service later.

Heinlein claims that ""[s]ince sovereign franchise is the ultimate in human authority

This theme of responsibility tempering authority is one which resonated with me. We allow ourselves to be governed by the whim of a public who has no stake in the collective. Did not our founding fathers intend to allow only those who owned property and therefore had a vested stake in the community to exercise franchise? That just kind of made sense to me. 

Citizens and civilians are held to the same law as each other, freedom of the press, and freedom of conscience are wildly protected in this system, but if you want to influence how things are done, you need to demonstrate you understand the responsibility which espouses that power. 

So r/politics

What many mainstream outlet don't talk about much is the long long history of American meddling in Latin America in the name of fighting communism and to protect the economic interests of our corporations. While we claim to champion ""Freedom"" and ""Democracy"" it is often those things that our foreign policy considers its enemy when Latin America does.

And when I say, and yet not at all unique, or even in the past really as we still protect terrorists in our own borders. The US is as much a state sponsor of terrorism as any other, we just don't think of it is terrorism when we do it.

Yet, not that it is really in our history books. We need that space for hero worship of slave owners and people who committed genoccide.

No, particularly how it applies to foreign policy, the actions of states. I don't agree with it one bit, but there is a line of thinking, oft repeated, here that the actions of states cannot be judged by any sort of morality. That calling a state hypocritical for doing things like publicly championing democracy while overthrowing democracies for dictators, is meaningless. It is a very Machiavellian view. And I would say you could construct a mostly consistent philosophy to say that realistically

But what does that mean. Suppose the actions of the US on its grumpy days, suppose those actions are justified because they advance the interest of the state. Can we really divorce any human actions from morality? If we were to do that, it would imply a contradiction, were we to apply it to our daily lives. If you were to behave that the United States did, to behave the way hawkish think-tanks write papers advocating, you would almost certainly be regarded as a sociopath. It is a very ego-centric way of looking at things. In Bob Altemeyer's The Authoritarians, he talks about ""Social Dominators"" the authoritarian leaders that people with authoritarian personalities follow. You would have a very hard time functioning and not experiencing universal condemnation for your actions if you behaved this way

The other thing is, if they didn't have the social distance that they do from the people impacted by our cruel actions, would tolerate the things that are done in their name, supposedly for their benefit.

There are many parts to the United States Constitution that come under constant scrutiny in conversations between both every day citizens and within the courts. Take, citizens have the right to own and carry weapons. Others point out that the language of the framers’ time is much different from ours, and they meant for the right to bear arms to be granted to militias, not individuals. However, not all debates stem from what the framers put in the Constitution. Topics such as marriage equality or abortion rights were not matters of importance in the late 18th century, so they are not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. Another one of these issues that is not in the Constitution is privacy. Nowhere in the Constitution are citizens explicitly granted the right to privacy. However, while privacy rights are not explicitly granted, Third and Fourth Amendments.

THE FIRST AMENDMENT
The First Amendment states “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” By guaranteeing citizens the freedom to exercise religion, the Constitution is granting the right to privacy of beliefs. However, in Reynolds v. United States (1878), it was ruled that laws “cannot interfere with mere beliefs and opinions, they may with practices.” This interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause remained until the 1960s, when the Court began to broaden their interpretation of the clause. For example, that an individual must prove two things: their religious beliefs are sincere and government action taken against them has become significant burden on their ability to act on their beliefs. If the individual is able to substantiate their claims, the Supreme Court held that “Neutral laws of general applicability do not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.”

THE THIRD AMENDMENT
The Third Amendment deals with the quartering of troops. It says, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.” Once thought a necessity in post-Revolutionary America, this amendment seems to have little to do with today’s society. In fact, the Supreme Court has never heard a case specifically regarding the Third Amendment. Nonetheless, the right of the people to deny housing to soldiers during peacetime is a matter of privacy. By giving the people this right, without the fear of military or government intrusion. Justice William Douglas argued to extend the Third Amendment to include police investigation of private matters in his dissenting opinion of Poe v. Ullman (1961). The plaintiffs in Poe were challenging a Connecticut state law that banned the use of contraceptives and banned doctors from recommending their use. The plaintiffs lost on the grounds that the law had never been enforced so it was not ripe to be challenged on its constitutionality. In Justice Douglas’ dissenting opinion, along with the First, institute “zones of privacy

THE FOURTH AMENDMENT
The Fourth Amendment grants “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” This amendment tends to deal with due process of the law. For instance, under the Fourth Amendment, the police are prohibited from searching a suspect’s home without first obtaining a warrant from a neutral judge. To get the warrant, the police must offer probable cause for wanting to search the suspect’s home. They must also, according to the Fourth Amendment, and the persons or things to be seized.” Originally, the Court held that a warrant was not needed for wiretaps if it were not in the home. Katz v. United States (1967) overturned Olmstead when the Court ruled “The Fourth Amendment protects people, the court determined that police had crossed the line when they used thermal imaging results of Kyllo’s home to get a search warrant for marijuana. The Court held that Kyllo had a reasonable expectation of privacy from surveillance carried out by equipment not commonly used.
Most searches and seizures require a probable cause. There are, as ruled constitutional in Terry v. Ohio (1968) and Minnesota v. Dickerson (1993). Terry established that officers may stop and frisk a person based on experience, but not probable cause, when searching for weapons. In Minnesota, they held that an officer may seize contraband, not only weapons, during a pat down if the contraband is apparent through the suspect’s clothes. Airports may search passengers without probable cause because of the risk of hijacking. Other searches for which probable cause is not required are sobriety checkpoints, drug testing of government employees involved in public safety
The exclusionary rule is quite important when it comes to the Fourth Amendment. The rule says that evidence gathered during an illegal search must be excluded in court. Exceptions to the rule can be applied if the officers conducting the search can prove they were acting in good faith (they were under the impression that the warrant they are executing is legal)
The Fourth Amendment also prevents police from executing what is known as a “dragnet.” A dragnet is a warrantless, they had to be given the go-ahead by the FISA Court. The court was instituted specifically for granting or denying requests to spy on an individual. The government had to establish probable cause for the surveillance, and had to be very specific about the person they were spying on and the means through which they would be conducting the surveillance. In 2008, the Bush administration amended FISA in the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (FAA) to get rid of many of the limitations established by the original FISA. The case which challenges the constitutionality of FAA, Clapper v. Amnesty International et. al. (2012) will be heard on October 29, 2012.

AFAICS this idea is officially endorsed by Israel, I don't understand how it can work and am wondering why it is so broaldy supported.

For Israel:

* this solution would not guarantee safety
* giving up part of Jeruzalem would be an unacceptable consequence
* any democratic Palestinian state would probably be led by Hamas

For the Palestinians:

* there would be no right of return and probably no compensation for lands lost (unless separately arranged)
* there would be little reason to assume something like the Gaza war could not happen again if rockets continue to be fired
* it is unclear whether Palestine could sustain the influx of refugees returning
* a partitioned territory with holes due to settlements would not likely result in a viable state
* the state of Palestine would be in many ways like the South African homelands

Given these problems, it would be much easier to implement a right of return in some form.

I just finished reading the first 10 pages of the CISPA law

http://rules.house.gov/media/file/PDF_112_2/LegislativeText/CPRT-112-HPRT-RU00-HR3523.pdf

Upon reviewing several posts on Reddit regarding the CISPA law I was initially surprised at the alarm the mention of this bill in Washington has caused. I read several articles about the law but was not satisfied with the meat they were providing

I am not familiar with citing legal documents, beginning on line 1: 

""‘‘(b) USE OF CYBERSECURITY SYSTEMS AND SHAR-
ING OF CYBER THREAT INFORMATION.—"" 

The indication seems clear to me that no corporate or utilities entity is legaly obliged to engage with this information sharing with the Federal Government.

Now go to page 5

""(2) SHARING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERN-
MENT.—""

This is where the good meat is.

The law begins to state that upon requesting information from a corporate or utilities entity

Now please look at page 6
 
""(3) USE AND PROTECTION OF INFORMA-
7 TION.—""

The law begins to state EXPLICITLY that the Federal Government is barred from using any information gathered for any purposes outside the framework of the CISPA legislation

I hope you are satisfied with my interpretation of the law. I voted my first time last November
If you object to my interpretation of the law

Thank you Reddit!

Now we both tended to agree that George's reaction and walkout was extreme and not reasonable.

However we started discussing whether refusing to debate someone because of personal involvement or identification with the motion could be justified.

It came down to the moment when Eylon Aslan-Levy began talking about Israel in terms of 'we'.

At that point is it justified to refuse to continue with the debate as the speaker is personally identifying with the group the motion concerns and therefore cannot be dispassionate in their arguments?

Or would it be justified only when the speaker begins to use arguments that are not rational and become emotive/personal attacks?

My information on CreditSesame is currently 136 days old right now
Push for more privacy restrictions on Social Security Numbers. Not every outfit out there should be able to even ask for your SSN (as businesses are already inclined to use it as an identifier, meaning it was printed on your ID card. This is probably more difficult to implement, however, as many businesses/operations already use SSNs, so there will almost assuredly be some pushback (and rightfully so), but I believe a compromise can be arranged.

2. Get rid of the backscatter body scanners in airports--and preferably the millimeter wave ones as well. I know Rapiscan is having their backscatter machines removed, as well as the millimeter wave machines, will still take a 'nude' image of travelers, but they will overlay a stick-figure like image showing any potential 'problem' areas. At the very least, the ionizing backscatters are the worst of the worst, and should be removed. MM-waves are hardly any better, but ideally I'd like to see a whole revamp of the TSA--less fondling and a return to metal detectors. The body scanners are terribly expensive,000 each

I will be entering my second year of political science in September and because of this I am starting to do some background reading on international relations theories as they will be one of the subjects I will studying coming semester.

However

I know Realism and Neo-Realism will be looked at extensively as a response to Idealism and that Liberalism and Neo-Liberalism will also be covered. I know a certain amount about both Realism and Liberalism and a decent amount about Marxism. 

Nevertheless

Some of the theories I have come across are:
•	Critical Theory
•	Positivism
•	Constructivism
•	Post-structuralism
•	Interdependence theory
•	Feminist theory

The wikipedia entries can be useful but are often filled with contradictions and definitions used interchangably and thus I am looking for more reputable sources. If possible all gathered together ;)

I think I follow the logic.

In addition, the higher the premium.

1.) Who pays for the difference between the costs and the cap value? Does that money come from the federal government or the states and how is it appropriated? (Will it be subjected to a new battle over appropriations every year.)

2.) Assuming (from the chart) that the cap on Out of Pocket Costs is 9.5% of a family's income for somebody with a income 399% of the Federal Poverty Line, or is there no cap ?) 

Often when people have chronic illnesses or when they are suddenly diagnosed with a serious illness, the higher the uncovered costs. Paradoxically, those with the lowest ability to buy ""gold plated"" plans (sick people) often have the biggest need for the better kinds of insurance. 

Currently

But that insurance tends to be way too expensive for many people who need it. In other states the cost is lower

Other states don't offer such programs at all. The people who cannot access any kind of insurance now are the people who seem to be in danger of falling through the cracks of the ACA as well. 

Many currently cannot buy insurance at any cost- and although they will in theory be able to buy it under the ACA, even if they are making higher incomes than the 400%

Chronically ill people are the ones who are the group of people who often these programs are most needed to help

If this weakness exists for this crucial group, if it fails in what many healthcare experts described as what should have been our primary mission.

My worry is many folk who have chronic conditions will find that they have no choice but to remain uninsured under the ACA because the combination of high uncovered costs and high premiums will continue to be be too much for them. The cap on OOP costs is potentially a very valuable benefit for some people, the OOP costs in some lower costs plans can exceed income - currently in many plans, there is no limit.

The test will be I think if families with a child or self-employed wage earner who gets hit with a major illness - perhaps they've bought a family plan partially subsidized by the ACA when they are in the 2nd quintile and have the cap

Also, and almost every other developed country, all doctors are ""in network""

1355159614.0,14m18a,Official Subreddit Rules,karmanaut,35,28,6,"I. Submissions

Every submission in /r/ask_politics must be:

* An actual question

* A Policy Proposal
 
* A [META] post
   
* An AMA post

* A special occasion post

Questions are just that: questions. Users should make every effort to ensure that their questions are clear

[META] posts are about the state and process of the subreddit; e.g. ""[META] We need to talk about downvotes""; ""[META] We now have 40

AMA posts are mod-approved ""ask me anything"" submissions from flaired users, and only with mod approval.

Special occasion posts draw attention to an occurrence or anniversary that would serve as good grounds for general discussion. Such posts can be about anniversaries of policies beginning or ending, but only after receiving mod approval.

If a submission in /r/ask_politics does not fit into one of these categories

II. Commenting

There are two types of comments: top-tiered and non-top-tiered. Each type of comment is governed by different rules.

II(a). Top-Tiered Comments

Top-tiered comments should only be serious responses to whatever the thread is about. If it's a question, worthwhile points of discussion. In all cases, it is permitted to ask additional questions to clarify the OP's submission or to follow it up.

Memes, or other unhelpful comments are not permitted, though exceptions may be made for jokes if they are only part of an otherwise informative comment. The answers provided in /r/ask_politics should be informed, comprehensive, serious and courteous -- that is, they should be such that a reader would depart feeling as though he or she had actually learned something.

Sources in top-tiered comments are not an absolute requirement at first if the comment is sufficiently comprehensive, please think twice before answering in the first place.

Partisan bickering and name calling is not welcome in this subreddit. If you came here to score political points or to parrot unsourced talking points

II(b). Non-Top-Tiered Comments

Comments that are not in the top-tier are less restricted.

Non-top-tiered comments should still have a positive purpose -- if they exist for no other reason than to insult someone they will still be deleted. Nevertheless, and will be moderated with a somewhat lighter hand.

II(c). On Speculation

We welcome informed, while this is a public forum it is not an egalitarian one; not all answers will be treated as having equal merit. Please ensure that you only post answers that you can substantiate, if asked, and only when you are certain of their accuracy.

It is perfectly acceptable to ask a follow-up question of your own if you aren't sure about something

II(d). Posts from Novelty Accounts and Bots

Bots will be banned on sight

Users may post from novelty accounts provided they do not do so ""in-character."" This applies both to accounts with a particular gimmick (only posts one word

III. Flair

Flair is for users with an extensive knowledge of a given topic area. Until categories of flair are established

III(a). Applying for Flair

To apply for the flair, or that you have studied it academically. Acceptable proof would include ID badges or paystubs, degrees or other certificates, etc. Anything that proves your claims. All proof sent to the moderators will remain 100% confidential, under any circumstances.

III(b). Flaired Expectations

Users with flair must have two things:

* An extensive knowledge of their topic area

* The ability to convey their personal knowledge and experiences in a way that is understandable to a person unfamiliar with politics.

Flaired users are held to a higher standard. They must be polite, but they will be treated just like any other user when they do so.

Flaired users who fail to meet the above expectations should be reported to the moderators.

III(c). Non-Flaired Expectations

We welcome the participation of non-flaired users so long as it conforms to all of the above rules. It is especially important for us to allow such participation given that it is one of the chief ways in which we can find out which non-flaired users should be given flair at all. Nevertheless

III(d). Conduct for All Users

Regardless of flair, or other forms of bigotry, no matter your credentials.

IV. Discipline

Those who break the rules outlined above will likely find themselves under scrutiny. Disciplinary actions on the moderators' part come in three forms:

* Gentle reminders
   
* Formal warnings
    
* Bannings

Gentle reminders will see a moderator suggesting you shift your tone, but without any suggestion of the matter being especially severe.

Formal warnings will be delivered for especially grievous infractions

Bannings are reserved for users who:

* Commit multiple infractions in spite of warnings and correction

* Respond with hostility and rudeness to attempts to warn them (**note: this does not mean you can't respond at all; we're quite open to being asked why warnings or reminders have been handed out -- just be courteous about it!)
 
* Are clearly trolls

* Engage unrepentantly in racist

* Are spammers

* Are bots -- even relatively benign ones

IV(b). Appeals

If one of your comments has been wrongfully deleted

These rules are subject to change at any time

Given that terrorism is apparently omnipresent, the [David Foster Wallace](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/11/just-asking/306288/) side - which said that terrorism and a certain level of carnage are the cost of doing business as a free society, or do we presume that there is some variant of a police state that sufficiently represses  terrorism enough to cost-justify itself in other terms.

I find that it's the latter case that simply has no chance

I know that through the Cold War the grand strategy could be neatly referred to as ""containment"" and although this evolved throughout the 40 years it was essentially the core strategic guideline the whole time.

After the Cold War we have this ""unipolar moment"" (Krauthammer) and the United States has the potential to pursue a wide ranging number of policy options now that it is unrestrained by the Soviet threat.

Attracting the best talents makes us more competitive on a global scale

However, and I had the strong impression that they didn't want me to be there. It took me a while to figure out where this generalized resentment was coming from, and my conclusion is that I was seen as a threat for them. I was qualified, motivated, and willing to assimilate myself and learn their language. They probably thought that I was going there to steal one of their jobs, even though my purpose was not to get a job there at all (salaries are ridiculously low).

Once I was back in my country, a top institution in Canada.

Now these two realities changed my perception about immigration in Canada. First, there are those immigrants who come here with the sole focus on landing a high paying job and don't care to assimilate themselves. I realized that some of them end up choosing a French speaking province such as Quebec because they face less competition here, and that it is totally possible to find a job without knowing French.

Chomsky once mentioned that many economists will say that immigration is a good thing because it increases overall efficiency. However

I would not have a problem with a graduated pro tax that taxed the poor a very small percentage if it taxed the wealthy much more than it does today and made essential services like healthcare and education free to everybody. 

There is a real need for lifelong education because for the kinds of professions which are emerging and growing, they devote a lot of energy to pushing the envelope in new directions and its that process - much like directed play, if you enjoy it, that has proven to be the most powerful way to learn. That kind of learning doesn't have to end at any given age. In fact, if we are to stay competitive as a nation, it *can't*.

*I think there would be little need for welfare if we instead had free lifetime education.* But, not the kind of structured schooling that most of us think about. **""What if"" when somebody was unemployed, they could choose to go back to school, at any point in their lives?** What if we made that choice really work in an altogether new way - Something that would leverage one of the most unique assets of the United States, its inventive people- to its best advantage.

A new kind of educational institution, into reality. 

These campuses could function as needed, rich and poor. (The idea would be that everybody had something they could offer) 

They could even offer (for people who needed them) dormitory style living arrangements. For people involved in technology, one would have to have a faculty advisor and your learning plan would need to be approved as having merit, and you would need to make progress on it. These schools would endeavor to be real centers of learning for people of all ages. Numerous ideas that people have which could be commercialized could be developed in them People could form companies within this framework which would give them a great deal of support, meeting rooms, access to equipment and advisers, who could be retired businessmen and engineers, as well as people currently working who would devote some portion of their time to community development.

The government and industry would both derive benefits from having this resource available.

This would also offer an opportunity for older people to earn income teaching classes or mentoring younger people, really gave people a leg up in the workplace. I think we would also find that many Americans had hidden talents that we would never have otherwise discovered. Also, we could use this program to build up a national database of people and skills to match with one another when they requested such matching.

People could learn, with an eye to keeping them on track with their goal of developing new businesses and methods, so fraternity style organizations and collegiate style partying and drinking to excess on campus would be prohibited. (If people wanted to party, they would be required to go elsewhere and not bring the party back to the dorm, out of respect for the fact that it was a place of learning, like a library.)

Married students would be allowed to live together as long as they made progress on their goals and projects. It would not be a place for idleness.
