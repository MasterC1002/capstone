At the Leesburg Baker's Dozen mountain bike race (a 13 hour endurance race) we were asked to pack out what we pack in, camped, and enjoyed the weekend on this farm.  I took the first photo about an hour into the race about 10 AM. (actually a screen grab from a gopro)  The second photo when I was breaking down camp at about 10:30 AM the following day, It's from roughly the same spot.   I can honestly say I didn't see any garbage left behind.  There were maybe 3 other campsites still there when I left.  It didn't really strike me as anything, until I remembered what the grounds of every other festival/large gathering of people looks like the following day, and how this was nothing like that.  nobody enforced any rules, or went around telling people to pick up their garbage

TL;DR 13 hour mountain bike race

people ask all the time how to get better and faster.  developing a rider's eye, but makes the ride more fun.  

a rider's eye takes two things:
1 - knowledge of what your bike can do and the trust in your bike's capabilities
2 - a sense of play.  it's not all fitness

it seems lots of people, it's what they do.  i don't understand why someone would drop two thousand or more on a full suspension bike and then be afraid to roll over stuff or use all that suspension.

I see a lot of posts about disc brake issues. So as a lifer shop mechanic I feel I can share a few observations that I have seen over the years. This will all be based on my personal experiences trying to solve problems for customers. Take it or leave it.

Noise is the most common complaint by far. When you take your bike into your LBS (local bike shop) and tell them your brakes are making noise. The mechanic is handcuffed because they know it is common and sometimes impossible to solve without replacing parts which are expensive and often seem unnecessary especially when a bike is almost new. 

If the customer initially fails to ""bed"" discs in correctly it is next to impossible to undo that process. When bedding in a brake pad material transfers from the pads themselves into the rotor surface

 The pads can be sanded the rotor can be cleaned with all manner of tricks. The most common being brake cleaner on the rotor and sand paper on the pads then attempt to re-bed them in. The problem with that is very often the noise will come back because the deposits on the rotors aren't going to be removed with brake cleaner. You could try to mill or sand rotors but it is next to impossible to get the desired level of finish required to get good power.
 
With that said

Ok

Last tip, even ""feathering"" your brakes reduces your cornering traction and your straight line stability. So brake in sections, completely let go as much as you can. Fight the urge to brake and you riding improves as well as your bikes brakes will work when you need them.

If all else fails. It's new rotor and pad time. Very expensive but for your sanity and mine it's sometimes the only way. If you take a look at both Avid and Shimano brakes. Year over year no matter if nothing else in a particular brake has changed the rotors typically have been redesigned.

Having said that, lifting, etc.). From first hand experience, I wanted to say that you should all be careful. If you're not sure about a jump or a trail, find someone who knows the trail and check their speed on it instead of gunning it yourself. If you're debating on going on a massive jump that you haven't attempted before, maybe consider finding someone who knows the speed of it before launching yourself off of it. 

A serious injury can fuck you up for a good long while

Have the time of your life and don't let your worries and doubts impede your leisure and recreation. But use good judgement and don't be stupid. Being wreckless on trails is a needless danger to not only yourself

WARNING: drunken rambling

we are riding bicycles, the only thing that actually matters is that you are riding a bicycle. if you ride a bicycle, you are automatically in the club, riding a bicycle is the only requirement. what you ride is insignificant. 

no one cares what you ride.   i say this for two groups of people.  

group 1 - you are not going to impress me with your bicycle. i don't care how tricked out your bike is, if you can't ride it on anything more technical than a rocky dirt road, i don't care.  your bike doesn't impress me, how you ride it impresses me.  perhaps i'm jaded because of the people i ride and hang out with, who don't have anything to prove because riding bikes is what they do, it's their job.   you might ""race"" pro, but do you place pro? no? then stop acting all bad ass

group 2 - i don't care if you are on a crappy hardtail bike.  don't be intimidated by those who ""look the part"", and full suspension bikes.  i don't care that you are a beginner, or that you suck, or that you can't make it up that rock ledge or off that drop.  if you are out there riding your bike, that is awesome and all that matters.  again, it's not what you are riding that matters, it's how you ride it.   are you having fun?  that is the only thing that counts.  so you are on a trek 820?  no one cares. you are out riding it? that's all that matters.   

a guy on a trek 820 with toe clips who rides his bike all the time on everything with gusto and heart and soul

by all means post your new bikes

there is a time and place to be serious about cycling.  i would say 98% of the time is NOT the time.   

i'm being a bit of a retro grouch here i guess.  i sort of miss the ""old days"" when mountain biking was about travel, fucking around, and a ""brotherhood"" of sorts, and not competition, what you look like or what you ride or what you are wearing.  

racing is racing

a cool bike is a cool bike

soul.  it's about soul.  

have fun

To give an example I was usually near the end of my category (Sport DH) of about 30 riders and couldn't quite understand why I felt as fast as the other guys in most sections but my overall time was way off. Watching the cornering video made me realise my technique was totally wrong and I now corner and carry loads more speed. Looking at my practice times I am fully expecting to be in the top 3 this year. Its crazy how a simple video can help you so much. Anyway

All those components can be changed, agreeable geometry to suit the average rider. However

These are the numbers I think are most important when choosing a frame:

**Head angle**: The larger the number the quicker the steering and vice verse. XC bikes will normally have a head angle of 68 or 72* because it turns faster and climbs more easily. AM and DH bikes will range from 68* to 61* because it will be much more stable at high speed.

Further detail from dandelusional: 
 A slacker head angle not only increases stability at speed on the bike
Downsides other than those noted above would also include a tendency for the front wheel to wander on climbs (can be overcome somewhat with a steeper seat angle to keep the weight forwards).
Just to further separate this out
This is all in regard to 26"" wheels. Bigger wheels normally run steeper head angle (bigger number) relative to their 26"" counterparts due to the larger wheels greater ability to roll over terrain

**Wheelbase**: Larger means more stable

**BB height**: Lower means better handling since your center of gravity is closer to the ground

**Effective top tube length**: Make sure this is the number you're looking at

**Standover height**: Lower is almost always better because it will be more out of the way. Remember that you need to be dynamic and move around when riding.

**Chainstay length**: Shorter chainstays will make it easier to get the front end up

Since I just painted it yesterday

I got it in aerosol can form at the Home Depot, not bad at all! The only prep i did was disassembling the frame so that each piece could be painted individually, and cleaning the frame beforehand with simple green and giving it a good wipe before I started painting.

Although I was seriously injured I couldn't wait to get back on my bike.  But I knew I'd be better prepared this time.  Bought a new [bike]( http://i.imgur.com/TY0ciQj.jpg) which I've been mainly riding XC on since there aren't any real hills near me.  I also bought some [body armor](     http://www.motorcycle-superstore.com/2/6/10/45258/ITEM/SixSixOne-Vapor-Pressure-Suit.aspx), right?). 


On Sunday I was finally able to head up the same trails where I had my crash last fall.  I was really excited to be riding DH again!!!  


Once we arrived I got scared.  I rode the trails

As the day went on I did get more comfortable and started riding some of the features instead of bypassing them.  Finally hit the [rock garden]( http://i.imgur.com/uTE0XDs.jpg) at speed


Right before we left I finally got up the courage to hit the jump that took me out last November.  Although I didn't get nearly as much air as I normally would have

Yesterday's ride should have been a fairly straightforward loop up and around Mount Wilson but a series of unfortunate wheel/tire mechanicals and equipment failures rendered my friend’s bike un-rideable and we were still a good 10 miles from civilization. Despite futile attempts to repair the bike, we managed to find some mobile phone coverage, and, feeling a little run-down and under pressure after 8 hours out there, and knowing there was several more hours ahead, we decided to err on the side of caution and call the emergency services with our GPS coordinates and our planned route off the mountain. The plan being that we would confirm with them once we had exfiltrated the mountain safely. 

To cut a long story short, we were unable to regain network signal even after traveling for several more miles in the general direction of suburbia. The only useful information we had time to pass on was our names, the name of the trail and that we were approximately above the city of Monrovia. Within the hour, the LA County Sheriff's Air Rescue 5 helicopter located us on it’s first pass up the mountain, literally flying in right overhead. I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt it was us they were looking for. An LA County Sheriff paramedic [rappelled down through the canopy](http://i.imgur.com/QKdo4.jpg) onto the trail. After relaying our current situation to him, he decided we'd been out there long enough and made the call to airlift us off the mountain...as it turns out, he was in much better position to assess the situation than we were. We were very dehydrated and quite sun-burned.  Ironically he is also a mountain bike rider and racer and understood our predicament and the series of unfortunate calamities we’d experienced. And so after a short hike to some open space, covering our faces from debris kicked up by the rotor wash. 

A [short chopper ride](http://i.imgur.com/ut2z8.jpg) to the nearby helipad at Chantry Flats and a car ride back to Sierra Madre Search and Rescue station followed. Although no one was hurt, covering 30 miles and ascending [over 8000 vertical feet](http://i.imgur.com/CuK1q.jpg). Rather dehydrated, leg cramps, and a little exposed but ‘ok’. Two bottles of water in the helicopter, a big bottle of Gatorade at Sierra Madre Search and Rescue Station and three 24 oz bottles of cytomax within two hours of getting home and it dawned on me just how depleted I was. I'm very grateful to the LA County Sheriffs department for finding us and helping us out of a tight spot (literally) with such precision. Also the volunteers at the Sierra Madre Search and Rescue Station for their hospitality. As much as I'd like to think that we would have made it out of there just fine (albeit several agonizing hours later), I'm glad they showed up when they did. [They are all true professionals.](http://i.imgur.com/tkAOs.jpg)
 
The mountains are a spectacular place to explore and experience and I’m blessed to have the San Gabriel’s literally on my doorstep. But you also need to have a healthy respect for those hills; No matter how many times you’ve ridden up them, you can still find yourself in a tough spot and there's no substitute for preparedness.

Oh... and there is no bill for the helo ride :)

Edit: Many readers seem to be skipping over the part where I **DID NOT** request a rescue - but rather was giving an FYI that we were out in the hills and that if they if nobody hears from us in a few hours that THEN they should come looking for us. The call dropped - we could not get reception - they came looking anyway.",,t5_2qo3d,1343957973.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/xl8gx/mtb_helicopter_evac/

Well I was bombing down at 22mph'ish and a bloody wasp flew in my helmet via the air vents and proceed to sting the living shit out of me. I got 3 big lumps above my right eye and I think another 2 on my right temple....

It was one of those moments that I couldn't do anything. I needed both hands to stabilise myself so I couldn't get rid of the damn thing. Also I had someone just behind me so that could have been dangerous.

I had to wait for the end of the hill and just let the little bugger sting me over and over again.

I do have to say, had I taken a spill I could have been seriously injured. There were sections that were very thin and sharply curved that were steeply uphill, and if anyone were to fall they're break some bones for sure.  

I saw some deer too

Via is not responding to the police requests to see surveillance tapes, and now it's too late to catch who caught my bike, or to find it in one piece. I am devastated and depressed at the loss of my bike and my race season. :(",chopstix007,17
My race bike was stolen from the building where I work... our offices are above Via Rail, I stopped short when I noticed my bike was gone, and immediately alternated between hyperventilating, crying, and panicking. What the hell do I do?? Who do I contact?? Where's my baby?? This bike is (was) my baby, my training partner... it even had a name! (White Lightning.) It was my prized possession and the one thing I would take with me to the grave. It was also an original- it was ridden in a World Championship race by someone on the Specialized team in the early 2000s. It was still marked 'for race only', and was lighter than air because of the super awesome team-only carbon-mixture frame. It was completely silent racing down a hill, it knew me

Since the bike was worth $5000 in parts alone, thinking there may be a chance someone could access the security cameras I saw. No go- the only ones there were workers on the Goderich-Exeter Railway line. I was given a name of who to speak to the next morning when Via staff came in. 

DAY 2 (April 10):
Met with the Officer doing the report, but he was unreachable. The cop called Via head office to try and get someone out to show the tape, but was informed that it wasn't that easy... they'd have to verify his identity as a cop, go through paperwork, put in requests, and then personally send someone from head office (I'm assuming all the way in Toronto or Montreal) to show him the footage when there was time. The cop stressed the urgency of seeing the tapes and Via didn't budge. They also didn't return calls or schedule anything as they said they would. Procedures could take weeks. 

He called another Via line and had someone local come in that, he was informed that the video surveillance wasn't under the control of Via, but a management company that ran the building, and that Via has nothing to do with it. (These surveillance cameras were only installed two months prior.) This management company, coincidentally, was hired by Via Rail.

DAY 3 (April 11):
The Constable on the case called Via all morning, so he called at fifteen minutes, then twenty, then thirty, and continued to do so all afternoon... essentially spamming Via with voicemails to call back (and yes, keeping track of calls and making records). He received no calls back for the second day in a row.

NOW:
We have yet to see the cameras, both which could have lead to a criminal apprehension if the tape had been viewed in time. 

TL;DR: Specialized race bike, and Via isn't cooperating. This delay has cost me any hope of getting my bike back in one piece. I'm devastated at the theft of my baby, the loss of my race season, and the fact that I won't be able to ride anymore since I can't afford another bike of that calibre. I'm disappointed in humanity for being capable of such despicable acts, and in corporations that just don't care.

One of the most frequent things I hear from non-riders that I try to convince to ride with us is that they're scared. Looking at things like Rampage, in an attempt to say ""hey look everyone, we don't all [ride like this](http://vimeo.com/58866685)"".

So far, I'm happy to listen!

The main point of this post, access to trails, bugs, dirt, etc), but I'm of the mind that the huge drops and jumps we usually show people are a pretty large contributing factor. Should we as a community be working to mitigate the sort of terrifying, death-defying aura that seems to cover the entirety of mountain biking

I've heard of people getting flak from local riders for ""exposing"" the lesser-known trails to a more general audience, but you could argue that a bigger community will have more power to lobby for new trail systems to be built/maintained/opened, right?


**TL;DR:** Should we be trying to break the perception of mountain biking as just an extreme sport

A guy on a very nice LaPierre kindly stopped and offered me a patch, old skool so we needed glue. He had ran out of glue, thought bugger! He offered his spare tube but i thanked him and refused, I couldn't take his only spare tube. But not to worry, I was prepared for the walk anyway. I thanked him and he was on his way. I carried on walking. 10 minutes later and a guy on a road type bike stopped and offered help, was great, got the second hole patched and managed to cycle home. 

I just think its great knowing that even as complete strangers we can still pull together and help each other out.

Here's my edit.  Apologies for the spectacularly shitty transitions and overall choppiness.  It ain't bad though.  Had to work with the footage I had.  No music

Ray's MTB park in Cleveland, is an indoor bike park of almost incomparable quality.  To know a place like this exists...in CLEVELAND of all places, is mind blowing.

This was my first time there and I felt like a fat kid in a Swiss chocolate shop (I've been to Switzerland - those fuckers know chocolate).  At first I was a little gun shy on some of the obstacles, and I am confident you could tackle just about everything there.

As proof of this, lots of kids who are just incredible and doing all the shit we watch weekly in Red Bull vids, right next to you, showing you up close how it's done. 

The place is fucking magical.

Oh and one more thing, I'd wager.  Makes me feel pretty good about the future of mountain biking.

I go out on a ride every single day.  Most days I go up to the mountain and get in 5 or 6 runs on the longest trail up there and really push myself hard to absolutely pin it down and get in every pedal stroke I can.  Sometimes I just go ride the most uneven sidewalks I can find and just goof around on them.

And after I found out the damage I was really bummed.  When I explained it to people I'd say ""I hurt my left arm, why I ride.  To explain the absolute joy and sense of accomplishment I feel when I fly down a trail.  They still don't get it.

So I started wondering...  For all of you, if you had to pick one video segment to show someone how and why you ride, what would you pick?  I don't care if you do XC, AM, Enduro, Trials, DH, WHATEVER....  What would you show someone to try to get them to understand what you do?

1353871566.0,13rr0l,I make open source MTB trail maps. Got questions about making your own? Ask here!,c0nsumer,66,8,35,"I make MTB trail maps for our local MTB organization

I've seen a number of questions about making maps come up here on Reddit

To start, these are open source maps. Also, by putting the map data into OSM first then other online maps can benefit from the enhanced data set, people can view the trail routes using viewers such as [OsmAnd](http://osmand.net/) on their phones.

Here's examples of some of the maps that I've done. They are all generally in the same style so they can be CRAMBA's maps

* [River Bends Park](http://mmba.org/library/maps/riverbends/latest.pdf)
* [Stony Creek Metropark](http://mmba.org/library/maps/stonycreek/latest.pdf)
* [Addison Oaks County Park](http://mmba.org/library/maps/addisonoaks/latest.pdf)
* [Clinton River Park Trails](http://mmba.org/library/maps/clintonriverparktrail/latest.pdf)

To start

* Remember that your map will mostly be used by those who do not know the trail. Think about every aspect of the map from the perspective of a new user first.
* Don't use a satellite photo for your map background if you can help it. This makes it hard to print and often hard to read.
* Test reading your map on-screen using color blindness simulation software such as [Color Oracle](http://colororacle.org/).
* Be sure your map prints properly and is easily readable in both B&amp;W and color

All this information can be found in various places online, participated in early Repack races in nearby Fairfax (Today is the 35th anniversary of the first one) and rode the area on and around Mt. Tamalpias with his friends. In 1977, he built built Breezer #1, the bike generally accepted to be the first purpose-built mountain bike. 9 more similar bikes soon followed. Joe was also a Cat 1 road racer during this period.

Joe continued making bikes under the brand name Breezer throughout the 70s, and 2000s. Breezer grew into a larger-scale company during this period, with Joe designing each model and heading the company. In late 2008, Breezer was acquired by Advanced Sports International, and Joe stayed on as designer. The sale allowed Breezer to start making mountain bikes again, for the first time since 2000.

1372538502.0,1hbtsh,I had my first proper crash today,refomokm,69,14,39,"And I actually felt great about it. I was at the downhill woods I ride most days for the third consecutive day after getting home. I'd had a really good session

At the top of the woods on the last run of the day I remember thinking, usually from being too cautious - never over the bars. I decided I'd try and push myself a bit on this last run, so I hit the slope into the first corner and pushed through the berm without braking; much bigger than usual off the first jump, fast into the second corner over two roots - no berm here so you have to scrub a lot of speed (I'm yet to find a really quick way to do it). Into the short flat bit past a tree into a very steep bank (too steep to walk); for the first time ever I didn't brake at the top, so rolled into it very fast. That spits you out onto a little shallow bump which I normally pump, so I float over the top, push the bike down - oh shit I'm already airborne because of all that extra speed.

The bike hit the ground nose first, and rather than executing a gentle left turn across the large flat section to the next stretch of trail, I found myself careering at high speed, wheels locked, into a pretty substantial thicket of trees. Next thing I know, I'm several metres past the trees, having bounced off at least one on the way through, feeling a little bruised but mostly fine.

I've been riding downhill for a few months now and finally having a big(-ish) crash proves several things: that buying a full-face and big pads was worth it (the helmet got a nice scratch on the side), oddly enough, that the risks are completely manageable: I fell off because I made a mistake because I was pushing my limits too hard, not because of some freak accident that I had no control over.

Turns out I'd buckled both my wheels quite significantly

I guess I'll just be the asshole who says it. I give as much of a fuck about your bike on a fence as I do about all the redditor parents showing off what their kids made at school. /r/skateboarding is of a comparable size and not like this at all. There are new videos and discussions every day that are worth checking out. Here? Not so much anymore.
