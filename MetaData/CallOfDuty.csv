This tweet was to the community manager Robert Bowling, I figured, if they won't listen to me... they will listen to thousands of people.

I also released the prestige hack shortly after:

**What was the response from Activision?**

Too bad I knew what I was talking about, I knew other ways of exploiting this, and I proved it to them when I made this video after the patch:

**[Uploaded on Dec 21

Activision's response? 

My youtube account was suspended due to Activision/Infinity Ward

Not only was my account suspended. I was contacted by Activision attorneys several times

After that everything went downhill and I had to stop modding/hacking. It was fun while it lasted, no matter who you are or how old you are.

We all know that technology is limited, that I'm surprised no one else has asked, is how many rounds of Zombies are there?
You may say ""Well
For those who don't know, had a limit to the levels you could play. This was because the arcades worked on 8-bit computers, so they could only store an amount of levels that didn't exceed 8-bits.
What are bits? Bits are the number of places in the Binary code that computers use to count. Binary, and 1.
Say I want to count in Binary. First, then I want 2, so what do I do? Well, I carry over. So, 2 in Binary is 10. Not ten, but one, zero. Then I add 1 again and I get 11
Now, I would run out when I hit 3. So, a 2-bit computer can only hold 3 levels.
Forgive me if you already know this stuff
But anyway, but another neat trick is to remember that each digit represents a power of two. The way to notate that is saying 2^n
The first digit is represented by how many 2^0’s I have. It’s crucial that you start with 0 rather than 1. Well
So
00000000
That’s the number 0
Well, and we find that we have 1 2^7. Then we add another 1 to the digit right of it, and we find that we have one 2^6. In fact, we can keep going and to figure out how many levels an 8-bit computer can hold we just do this: (2^7)n + (2^6)n + (2^5)n + (2^4)n + (2^3)n + (2^2)n + (2^1)n + (2^0)n , where n represents how many of those you have; and if we do that calculation, we find that an 8-bit computer can only hold 255 levels. It can’t hold more because the next digit doesn’t exist to this computer.
So, what would happen if we added 1 to each spot?
Well, and then you add ALL that up, and you get how many levels a 64-bit computer can hold.

So

1370319595.0,1fmr4d,Let's reboot MW2,windowpuncher,76,20,61,"Recently, the same thing over and over.  The balancing is ruining the games.

Unbalanced games are the best games.  Remember Quake and Quake 2?  Those were incredible fun.  The unbalanced weapons make it fun.  You spawn with some crappy machine gun that does nothing and get gibbed all the time by guys with rocket launchers and rail guns.  The fun comes from killing those guys with the top-tier weapons, balanced games, are just bland.  They've been balanced too much.  Every weapon feels the same.  They feel like they all do the same damage per second as every other gun, except in special circumstances like gun classes.  All the SMG's feel the same to me, as do all the assault rifles and machine guns.  It's just tedious.  MW2 is much more varied.  Of course there are the classic overpowered guns like the UPM-45, the SPAS-12 and the Barret .50.  However, the people using them are only people, they're easy to take out

So, but it could be so much better.  I have hundreds of hours invested in this game for a reason.  It's just so good, so much fun.  Let's play a few rounds.

**TL;DR:** The cod franchise has become boring due to balancing.  Let's go back to mw2 and have some fun.

Gun fights are whats fun about CoD, obviously).  There were very few interesting gunfights.  A lot of turn, hit someone twice and die, and a lot of getting 'legit' sniped over long distances when sprinting across longer sightlines toward cover.

You don't have a gunfight with a quickscoper; you just pray that you can kill them before they get their shot off most of the time.  Toughness is kind of irrelevant

I respect the hell out of the guys who are good at it; watching them play is often impressive - but I wish it wasn't in CoD because I miss the actual firefights.  I wish there was a way to remove quickscoping from multiplayer - and then add it back in as it's own party game (along with Sticks and Stones and such).  There's definitely a place for it, WAY, WAY negative).

___
***I'd like to start by saying I am not an MLG player

___
First off

**Game Mode**

Normal TDM on Outpost.  Riding solo

____
**Class Setup**

for those of you who like the IGN creator

For everyone else:

*Primary* : MP7 with Rapid fire and suppressor.  And of course

*Secondary* : MP9 with suppressor

*Equipment*  : Semtex and Flashbang

*Perks*  

1. Sleight of Hand Pro
1. Hardline
1. Marksman

*Kill streaks* : Specialist with blast shield

*Death streak* : Not important

________

**Tips

(disclaimer: This probably offers no new tips to an intermediate - advanced player


To start

*Settings

I play on PSN


*Tips and tactics*

Okay, I find that it is far easier to do well with tactical.  I'll say why in a second here.

Second: To rush or not to rush?  Let me start out by saying, switch corners, repeat.  So, I'd say I rush for the most part.  While camping can be effective, you look like a douche and I find it boring as all hell.  But a problem lies in rushing.  You are constantly moving, so you must be aware at all times to check who's to your sides, and every now and then, corner, they will probably win that fight. You just don't want to risk it by running blindly into situations like that.  You can do some things to mitigate that risk though.

1.  Prefire.  Prefiring is when you start shooting before you actually enter a room / walk around a corner.  You can choose to hipfire or ADS. The upsides of prefiring is if there is someone there, people will know exactly where you are. 

2. Walking around a corner ADS.  Basically the same as prefiring

3. Stun / nade checks.  Simple enough.  If you are going to enter a potentially enemy filled room, you can't replenish grenades, so you may be stuck without one when you really need it.

4.  My method of choice: The jump shot or drop shot.  I will explain these next.


Third: The jump shot and drop shot.  This right here is why I use tactical.  The drop shot is when you see an enemy, you jump when you see an enemy, effectively making yourself harder to hit because you are moving around.  If you get used to these tactics, use them in tandem.  When you go around a corner jump, then go to prone while shooting.  It is extremely hard to hit some one while they are doing this.  Try it yourself!

**Weapons

Not a whole lot I can say here, silenced and the FAD ext mags, silenced.  I would never normally use rapid fire on the MP7, since it only increases fire rate by a mere 11%.  Tmartn has an amazing video on the subject [right here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws_cCvqMu_k)

Perks.  Again, and marksman.  But its totally up to you to decide.  *Added by popular request*  For SMG's, or faster firing AR's, I would go for scavenger pro as a starter perk, and put sleight of hand as my first attained perk in the specialist package.  That way you aren't constantly looking out for scavenger packs (due to the increase in starting ammo)

Killstreaks.  Ahhh.  here we go.  as far as killstreaks go, it grants you every perk and proficiency simultaneously. When you get blind eye, assassin, and recon.  You are pretty much unstoppable. 

**Peripherals**

I use a standard PS3 controller, otherwise, you will just get sitrep.) I also find the fps freeks very handy.  Maybe ts just phycological, but I have far more precise aim when if come to those little movements to keep your shots on target. 

Well

I'm out

Considering whenever I play BO2, huge firefights - I find it hard to believe that the Ground Commander wouldn't be yelling his orders at us.

Granted - the other side of that is that its an offsite voiceover (assuming any amount of realism) so he's not in the middle of all hell breaking loose

I want to be yelled at - and all the Match Beginning and End Match voice overs are awesome. Modern versions of these shouts would just make the game more fun in my opinion.

1359910512.0,17t95q,A quick guide to diamond camo for special weapons.,Schrammbo,43,7,9,"Okay so for the combat knife it's pretty simple. Stack your class up with perks and sprint around on an objective game type such as domination. The perks I used were... 

PERK 1: Lightweight and Ghost. Lightweight allows you to navigate the map quickly and make your kills swift so you get in and get out. Ghost keeps you of the radar so when the other team is busy trying to get your teammates you can pick them off when their back is turned.

PERK 2: Fast hands and cold blooded. Those two perks allow you to be covert and quick so the enemy has a difficult time making the kill let alone finding you.

PERK 3: Dexterity and Extreme Conditioning. These two perks allow you to be fast and maneuver over objects faster. You can sprint faster as well.

WILDCARDS: Perk greed 1

At this point you are probably wondering ""Schrammbo what do I do with this last create a class point!?!"" Well you do whatever the fuck you want with it. I put a combat axe on my class. So that concludes the combat knife section of the guide. On to the next.

The ballistic knife is easy to get. I have no advice other than play ALOT of sticks and stones. There isn't any class setup for it because I played sticks and stoned but if you don't want to play sticks and stones then for your class just use everything in the combat knife portion of the guide and then spend your last point on the ballistic knife.

Same goes for the crossbow. PLAY ALOT OF STICKS AND STONES. I cannot stress this enough. Once you get most of your challenges you will probably get stuck on the bloodthirsty challenge. I just got mine in sticks and stones but it is difficult seeing as you have to get 5 kills with the 6 bolts you get. If you don't like that idea then you can go into any playlist (free for all suggested) and put on the Tri-Bolt attachment with your crossbow. Put on scavenger and then whatever else you feel comfortable using. With the tri-bolt attachment you can rush the enemy team and get direct impact kills if you're close enough. Direct impact kills make the enemy drop scavenger packs to replenish your ammo so it will come pretty quick.

As for the Assault/Riot Shield I suggest playing hard core. It is a one hit kill in hardcore allowing you to pick up more kills. 
For my perks I ran the same as my combat knife class
There is a camo for the assault/riot shield that says ""get 25 combat axe kills while holding the assault shield"" no worries

So that is my guide on how I got diamond camo for my special weapons. If you have any questions feel free to comment down below or PM me.

Assuming it stays in the same perk slot as it originally was, you have stopping power, UAV Jammer, Lightweight, Overkill, Danger Close.  Now assuming these perks all have pro version, stopping power has no real use with a pro upgrade.  It is just stopping power.

Now on the other hand, as does danger close.  Overkill is just a situationally strong perk depending on how it is used.  

Now if you take stopping power out of the equation of these perks, the only option they are left with is assassin.

Now if stopping power is an option, or extra explosive damage, have an alternative perk.  And stopping power has served its purpose.  It gives people who don't have any other alternative choices a perk that will provide them with a noticeable benefit.  In MW3, UAV's are useless.  Every player is using assassin.

With the reintroduction of stopping power

One might argue that stopping power would then become staple for competitive play

Call of Duty 4- I played for about 3 hours last night at about 7:00 pm Mountain standard time, Free for all had hackers that floated and got out of the map. Your best bet is TDM. I had no trouble finding a host and with no Hackers. But still be careful. People I talk to reported de-rank lobbies. Still worth the risk in my opinion. Overall, it was a good experience and I had fun with the nostalgia. Highly suggest you go back to it.
 
CoD: World at war- Stay away! WaW is a mess. I tried to play, aim bots. The only lobby that was even remotely playable still had this thing where your character slid around the map as if on ice. People I talked to on there also reported de-ranking lobbies. I don't think anyone would have fun playing WaW right now. I don't suggest it.

Modern Warfare 2- This one still has a strong following

Black Ops 1- Still has a strong following. Didn't see anything unusual TDM was great, but the guy said that was 3 months ago and he had not seen one since. Had no problem getting into a lobby. Overall, a good experience.

So, everything else seem to have a positive experience. Keep in mind, this is on Xbox. I don't know the status on PC or PS3. And enter these games at your own risk. There are still hackers out there. TDM seems to be the safest place to be. So, go out and have fun my fellow Redditers! I'll keep coming back to these games periodically and let you all know if anything changes.

Instead of just being thrown into a mission, a CQC teammate, and a rifleman? Hell, want to sacrifice one of your men to have a sniper to help you out? Go ahead. He will act like McKnight in BOII's mission *Suffer With Me*. 

After you are assigned a mission, whatever you want. Think you'll need night vision? Take it. Only catch, the game won't tell you what you would need for the mission. Want better sights? Well, between missions, hit up the shooting range. Build up experience with the weapons, get items, etc. Enter into a shooting competition to win a special weapon

After you arm yourself, wet suit for water based missions), etc. These outfits are mission dependent. Don't think you can do a water-based mission dressed as a middle eastern farmer.

Next, and instead, just actually make some new concepts for weapons. Think outside the box. Not a Neo-M16, but a Gravity Gun. (Not saying rip off the GG, but, you know) This also applies to grenades.

Ok but now let's focus on the real bad boys. All the tropes that come with a COD campaign need to get their dick crunched by a steel toed boot. Let's start with um... erm.. health. Health needs a complete redo. No more get shot, regenerate health, rinse and repeat. Bother that nonsense. Instead, bring in the doom style health system. That's right, start with the big 100, or maybe have like 10 bars of health, or have, have a health system that *does not regenerate*

Now we're getting good, but even should have light puzzle elements. Not necessarily making you solve a puzzle to get by, but maybe, say, exploding a crane that will drop whatever it's holding onto a group of enemies. I know it sort of does this already, but not enough of it. And hell, why not make puzzles that should be solved to get through? They could also be light

Now, it's this. STOP. THE. MOTHER. FUCKING. COMMANDS. When there's spotlights shining through, we do NOT need our partner to shout at the top of his longs to avoid the spot lights. We do NOT need our partner to tell us to get down when there is a fucking tank driving near us. We do NOT need our partner to tell us to stay quiet when we are HIDING FROM THE ENEMIES ALREADY AS HAS BEEN DECLARED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MISSION. Teammates need to keep their goddamned mouths shut. They can speak for characterization, or say things like RELOADING, but I swear to god if they even go as far as to *suggest* I take out the guy on the roof, balls are getting tapped. With a brick. A really dirty one.

Ah, BUT, we're replacing them with better, stronger, robotic parts. We HAVE the technology. Let's not stop yet. A big issue comes down to enemies. They aren't varied worth a shit. You've got the military guys with red berets, and the military guy with green berets, and sometimes, you get a military guy with blue berets. The all stand there retardedly and shoot, just being human. So why don't we make an effort to make the enemies varied? I'm not talking about introducing freaking aliens or mutants or something, let's throw assassins into the mix

I almost wouldn't mention vehicles because after playing Black Ops 2, lead a horse on a desperate struggle. But I mention this because the vehicle sections are *forced sections*. I don't like that and neither should you. It should almost always (I'm excluding escape scenes and other actual plot specific parts) be optional to go on foot or hop on the APC. Makes for re playability to have it set up this way, and more importantly, gives the player a lot more control.

Not even close to being done. That's a lie, but by god, I want to be able to tell a character is terrified, or amused, or has conflicting feelings, or just, SOMETHING. I mention story beside my existing argument for characters because I literally have no idea what could be done to fix it. There's little you can do, the best I can do is shrug.

Cutscenes. Cutscenes, then take another 20 steps forward and have another cutscene, and then take ANOTHER 20 STEPS FORWARD AND HAVE A CUTSCENE, it gets aggravating. Yes, when I plunge into the water, I don't need an automatic swim for me, just give me controller options to swim. Yes, I don't need to have to fall down and do the jazz hands maneuver for the fifth time. Yes

Firstly
Then WaW came around and I wasn't totally happy with it. I played it for a few weeks and it got boring so I sold it.

Then comes one of the greatest (and most broken Call of Duty's): MW2. 

Now you cannot lie and say you didn't play the shit out of that game. It was new

Months went by and we all eagerly awaited the next game in the franchise

We stopped playing MW2 and retreated back to COD4. Our so-called baby, we went back to MW2 to train for the next big game.

November rolled in and we fell in love with Black Ops

Now out of the all the Call of Duty's

1374417308.0,1ir1yf,Something I noticed about player quality,lilEndian,41,13,12,"I noticed something that says a lot about the community across varying schedules. To illustrate my point, skip to the bolded section ""What I Noticed"".

**2:30pmEST**  
I hopped into a lobby for some Kill Confirmed (pubs, I think?). I was playing with a friend, and about to change my Lightning Strike to an Orbital Vsat, which would be the highest streak I've ever used. He jokingly say ""Run swarm!"", so I put swarm on. Poking gentle fun throughout the game I said ""Remember, I'm going for swarm gameplay here, I have to play it safe"" as I was rushing with my FAL OSW. Then I noticed that I got a Merciless medal, and Swarm was about three kills away. I just about shit myself with excitement, and my body felt numb after calling in my first Swarm. It was so fun

**9:30pmEST**  
I checked the Lobby Leaderboards in this kill confirmed, Warthog, Dog combo. It was Drone, which is an inherit sniper-fest, but still an overall very fun map. The first death I had was by two ballistic-knifers zig-zag sprinting with lightweight and cornering me. This was partially my fault, because I paniced when I saw them. There was one guy on my team that continuously killed himself with the SMAW (at the end of the game he had over 200 deaths). There were also two gentlemen with riot shields and party rock shotguns in the building across from the factory. They didn't leave the position the whole game, and only wound up with a handful of kills because of how unpopular the location was (and because we just couldn't get the spawns to flip). I was able to get Vsat, only to get tomahawked the first time (he bankshotted down the stairs in the factory

**What I Noticed**  
Quite the contrary to what I thought would be the case, later in the night all of the 360noscopeyolo#420blazeitfaggot kids come out to troll. So, for the many posts and Youtube videos I see complaining about these kinds of players, try playing earlier in the day. My original hypothesis was that 9:30pm would be too late for them to even be up, but it seems to be just the opposite. I hope this advice helps anyone like me, that just wants to tryhard a bit to experience parts of the games that toxic players don't let them reach.

**TL;DR: Play earlier in the day**

I live in a generally urban, things went off without a hitch. It was fun times. Real good vibe going on. Then came the Black Ops launch. Holy shit, it was a different group. On the whole it was much louder, much more disorganized, there was a *ton* more litter, people were drinking and by the smell of the place you'd think every last person there was smoking weed (Neither of which I have a problem with anybody doing.. At home.)

And now it's no secret that apparently Black Ops II is a hot ticket item for scumbags to rip off from Redbox kiosks. You don't see /r/gaming flooded with printed out fake Halo discs. Experiencing both launches back to back the past two weeks, plenty of people do. It can't really be *that* much of a divisive and culturally different thing can it?

Instead of penalizing quitters by giving them a loss, maybe they could just lock them out for some period of time if they quit repeatedly. 

Just my two cents.

*Some Tips

[Here is the class I use.](http://www.ign.com/builds/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3?d=03006007300003600006200008209009410812012200000000013914014500000000017) Basically anything like this is fine, Dead Silence, and the Shotgun (because what's the fun without it?)

If you don't have the DLC

If someone's trying to boost with you, like a throwing knife, to take them out when they get to 23 kills or so.

Don't be afraid to wait around for the match to end. If you get a few kills at the beginning of the match when they're unwary of what you're doing, which, unless you have quite a bit of skill, is fairly hard to go up against. Since you have a lead, though, you can hide away and run down the clock. Bingo, win's yours.

I'm not trying to snitch on these people but people have been showing more and more interest in this game and I want to give them some advice before they join in.

 So when you join a match look at the gamertags. There is the obvious rainbow thing and the shaking but if the player has a clan tag with ""RAIN"", slow down gun firing rates and make it so you can't move or that you can only fly.

These are some of the gamertags of the hackers.

Don't get more wrong; I really enjoy playing the new CoD games. But I always thought that the best part of these games were the ability to play as an unknown soldier and follow him through whatever fate had in store for him.  I think that the best parts of these games were when you took a grunt soldier through the beaches of Normandy, who occasionally stepped up to achieve heroism when he had to. But now, we play as a badass spec ops dude who fearlessly slo-mo walks into gunfire and blows shit up and hacks enemy computer systems. 

Let me know if you have any thoughts. Like I said, but I really miss that feeling when you play as a WWII grunt, and right after you capture a crucial command point, your squad leader gets a radio call that forces you to backtrack, or tells you that you're progress was worthless.

[Article 2](http://www.shacknews.com/article/76005/call-of-duty-black-ops-2-security-servers-detailed)

&gt;Treyarch has posted a new FAQ for the PC fans of Black Ops 2. This time they are discussing how the PC team will handle online security

&gt;**What anti-cheat will be used?**

&gt;*Anti-cheat is a top priority for Call of Duty®: Black Ops II. We have developed our own proprietary server-side anti-cheat technology which will work alongside VAC to deliver the most advanced detection and banning capabilities of any Call of Duty game to date. We have also improved our player reporting system to make it the most effective way that you can help us catch cheaters. And starting on launch day we will have a full-time dedicated pc anti-cheat team focused solely on detecting and banning cheaters. We have a zero tolerance policy on cheating. Cheaters bans are permanent.*

&gt;**Will Black Ops have Matchmaking or Dedicated Servers?**

&gt;*Both! Call of Duty®: Black Ops II PC combines matchmaking with secure ranked dedicated servers. This means that you get into Public Matches or League Play via matchmaking lobbies. It is easy to party up and play with your friends. You can adjust your classes or scorestreaks between matches. It also means that every Public or League match is hosted on a dedicated server running in one of our high bandwidth datacenters around the globe.*

&gt;**Will you release the server files?**

&gt;    *No. We are keeping the server files secure to protect the game from hacking and cheating and ensure the ranking and progression system integrity.*

&gt;**Can I rent a server?**

&gt;    *No. We are providing a huge number of servers around the world at no extra charge – plenty for everyone to enjoy. And we will administer the servers.*

&gt;**Will there be mod tools?**

&gt; *No. As we continually improve and advance our in-house tools for our own content teams we are unable to provide consumer tools due to increased technical requirements


I stumbled on these articles just hours after I pre-ordering my PC copy. I skipped MW3 and had written off the series for being stagnant and repetitive, zombies, spectator mode, Treyarch at the helm...it actually seemed like they had finally made some changes that were worthy of a purchase. But after reading this news I might actually cancel it. I realize console players won't care in the slightest but this shit is ridiculous. Dedicated, *player controlled* servers, mods, and configuring the game are why PC gamers chose their platform. These are all things that have been restricted in this release and it's a slap in the face to the PC community. COD4 is still going strong precisely because it allowed players to do what they wanted: host their own games, with their own mods. This is just ridiculous.",t5_2rcq2,True

As someone who has always played COD in a knifey style I was very happy with the camo introduction and have been screen-shotting all the knives in game. This was partly because I found some of the camo's quite disappointing such as Ronin which just looks like a bit of a smear. I couldn't find a resource showing the in game screenshots rather than just the camo previews shown alongside the challenges so thought I'd do it myself.

In my opinion a good player should always try to win, how can you find out if a player is an aggressive teamplayer only from the stats in the barracks? 

I think the best way to find that out is to look at his kill confirmed stats. To be able to win a lot in kill confirmed you have to collect tags

And here is the thing: It is very rare to see a player who fulfills the point from above AND also has a very good kd-ratio!

Being in experiment-mode I decided to try to join these two together and created a so called overall-kd. It would work like this (example for my stats):

kills confirmed: 51353; kill denied: 11001; overall kill confirmed kills: 59655; kd-ratio: 1.879

[(51353+11001)/59655]*1.879 = 1.964 overall-kd

I know that this idea is maybe a bit crazy and I will maybe get downvoted to oblivion

I also don't think using your winrate in this equation would be a good idea because it can be influenced too easily by playing with a full lobby of people or just playing one gametype were it is easy to win just by getting kills like team deathmatch.

To be honest though, apart from the SubD technique, these techniques have been used in other current-gen titles such as Crysis 3 and Metro: Last Light.

They tell me that every match in COD is packed full of 12 year old racists yelling N-word and faggot on the mic. Yet when I play

They tell me I should hate MW3 because it is just a map pack of MW2. No. MW3 feel like a new game to me- Kill Confirmed and Team Defender are two refreshingly new game modes. Gun proficiencies are neat concept as well. The amount of class customization is so vast. Why do I insist on like a game that I've been told to hate?

I've never been a fan of the series due to lack of depth, that's not what this is.) CoD has always been jump-in-and-play with quick matches and not much incentive for non-voice-based teamwork (I understand with voice teamwork gets really strong in blops, I just can't stand using voice, and the game has no built-in incentive for 'natural synergy' like what Battlefield does with stuff like Suppression points, Squad Operation points, multi-man vehicles, etc.) which causes anyone not using voice to have their own agenda and it not feel very team-friendly.

I love Battlefield

None of that is the point of this post

I have found a new found love for Blops FFA, but when I first set foot in Nuketown with my M16 and 17 enemies, I was stuck. Ended up playing for a solid 8-10 hours the first day I recieved it.

Then I decided to try out some Zombies, has the most depth I've ever seen in a Call of Duty title. The sheer lengths the devs went through to make Zombies not feel like an after thought really blew my mind, and that was after I already had my mind blown by the awesome singleplayer main menu.

You have the point of view of a unknown man. You Wake up, moan a bit and walks over to the bedroom sink to freshen up. You look in to the mirror and realise that you are playing as Captain Price. But you look old. Realy old. At least 65. And he says something like : ""I better get a move on. To day is the day."" And the screen fades to black.

You meet up with a guy in a weelchair. He is even older than you are. More wrinkles and more scars. When you get over to him a green caption with the name ""Macmillan"" floats in front of him. He says: ""It`s been 10 years already? You still look like shit."" Price: “Right back at you old man.""

They enter a special forces cemetery (I dont know if it exists

The first mission with Gaz is a brief one. A hostage rescue in a Lebanon/Bosnia or Kosovo. In and out with a bang. Nothing more easy in the world. As they are extracted by Chinook

And from there on we are constantly switching between present day

Kamorov in Lebanon, Walcroft, Nikolai, First mission with Macmillan, and all the other characters who Price has made friends or enemies with. And what action and/or what mission he did to get promoted from Lieutenant to Captain.

The last mission is a long one with some sneaking in the beginning and a lot of explosions in the end as usual. Gaz is also there. And you realize that Price and Gaz are starting to become really close. They know each other’s moves

“We got a situation

The hangar doors opens, eh? How'd a muppet like you pass selection?”

With a BANG the screen turns black and in big letters it says “THE END” which morphs into “THE BEGINNING” and the credits roll.

EDIT - I've taken the liberty to weed through the answers and provide what I consider the best questions and answers set. There are a lot of TBA/TBD statements to some highly requested questions. You can find the original text and question set in the pastebin link below. I'll be editing that as well to streamline the reading.

[http://pastebin.com/NLfDvCT1](http://pastebin.com/NLfDvCT1)

One last note before we continue. A lot of information is going to be discussed and released this weekend during CODXP. 

    Platform Specific  
&gt; **Are any planned ELITE features incompatible with a privately rented dedicated server model for the PC platform? ** 
&gt;Since the PC is an open platform

&gt;**What about wii players? Is Elite available for us?**
&gt; 
&gt;The Wii community is definitely one that we love because of their dedication. With the technical challenges that come with the online component of the Wii

    Downloadable Content
&gt;**Will ELITE paid subscribers gain access to DLC on all platforms or just on the one registered with the service?**
&gt; 
Right now
&gt;**How long does someone have to be subscribed to elite to get the maps for free?**
&gt; 
&gt;While we haven’t yet announced specifics about how to people will receive DLC, you will receive DLC content the moment it is made available.  

    Services  
 
&gt;**I would like to know exactly what kinds of new stats (if any) will be provided by the Elite service. For instance
&gt; 
&gt;We’ve provided some initial demonstrations of our stat services in some of our early press coverage including the ability to review detailed information on all of your recent matches and recently played maps. Hopefully
&gt; 
&gt;**Will the Call of Duty games (Black Ops, it looks like Elite integrates &amp; aggregates data from multiple sources (from Call of Duty matches, from users entering &amp; uploading data, etc.). For example, when I fire up a CoD game in my Xbox 360 console, will there be something like an Elite ""tab/blade/dashboard/etc."" in the game's menus/interface that provides some kind of view &amp; interaction with Elite? Or will players need to keep some separate web-enabled device running side-by-side to view &amp; interact with Elite while gaming?**
&gt; 
&gt; We are working on a console application for Elite and we are looking forward to showing it to everyone soon.  Call of Duty Elite is dedicated to being where ever you are, in the game and with your console.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;**I'm a casual gamer
&gt; 
&gt;Call of Duty Elite’s goal is to provide something for everyone in the Call of Duty community. If you are a hardcore competitive gamer and want to analyze where on heat maps you can improve that is just as important as the players that want to get better and watch the videos about the different weapons or people that are looking to connect with other players who share the same interests. Call of Duty Elite is dedicated to bringing something to all of our Call of Duty players.
&gt; 
&gt;**Can you create private groups?**
&gt; 
&gt;Groups is a key function of Call of Duty and the ability to share things in a public domain. At Call of Duty XP we will talk more about what Clans will be and what they will offer to people looking for a key group of friends to play with.  

&gt;**Will there be competitions (either the beta or the full service in Nov) that cater to the gamer that has limited ability to play on certain days/times? For example
&gt; 
&gt;Yes,  for those people who are really pressed for time, Events are also available.  You can enter a screenshot or video contest event where you only need to upload an in game screenshot or video clip.  We will also have Operations for best Kill/Death Ration and for highest Score Per Minute. There will be something for everyone in our Compete section.
&gt; 
&gt;** Will there be a separate place for zombie tracking?**
&gt; 
&gt;Great question.  The Zombies community is really dedicated. While we were working closely with Treyarch to capture a deep level of mp stats

    Privacy  
&gt;**Will there be an option to turn off the stat tracking abilities of elite if I decide I would not like my information tracked and I don't want it interacting with my matches?**
&gt; 
&gt;We haven’t made any announcements yet regarding the privacy of your stats and gameplay.  That said
&gt; 
&gt;**As Elite could potentially hold a lot of detailed information about us via crossovers with facebook
&gt; 
&gt;All excellent questions.  Platform stats will not be intermingled with one another for a variety of reasons at this time.  However

    Miscellaneous  
&gt;**As elite directly ties into the game
&gt; 
&gt;Great question.  You can expect all features of Elite that integrate directly into MW3 to be thoroughly tested.  Our goal is to provide the best service possible.  Doing anything to impact the gameplay runs 100% counter to our goal.  
&gt;**How will elite allow us to enhance an existing community
&gt; 
&gt;There will always be a place for the Call of Duty fansites and we’re incredibly thankful for the enormous Call of Duty community that has been out there gathering on their own for years.  For those people loyal to their existing fansites, a fansite can create a Group within Elite, and people who love that site can now congregate within Elite, compare stats, message each other, and set up games to play.  
&gt; 
&gt;**Will all aspects of COD Elite be available through a browser and in game or are certain elements of elite only available through the cod elite website or only available through in game interface?**
&gt;
&gt;Elite will be available on the web, ipad, tablets and console (via a title app) this fall day-in-date with Modern Warfare 3.  Each one of these is customized to the capabilities of the platform, so we will endeavor to provide the features that make the most sense with each.  
&gt;**Will there be an API for COD Elite?**
&gt; 
&gt;We will not have an API for Call of Duty Elite at launch. We want to service the community directly and want to be in constant communication with those using the service and playing the games.

In MW2, your specific pokemon are like your weapons and perks. The more you use them, the more they level up. In pokemon they evolve and learn new attacks and in MW2, you unlock weapon attachments and pro level for perks, which is kind of like evolution. You can also get XP by doing objectives and stuff. Now of course Pokemon had a story and it was mostly single player, but that didn't have much to do with the level up system. In Pokemon you got more pokemon as you explored more and in MW2, you get new guns as you level up.

I think that this is why it works and this is why people it's addictive. Pokemon was very addictive and so is this.

Our story begins with a dream a simple dream to improve the human condition to make us live longer better lives to heighten our senses to a near super level to make our lives as best and easy as possible. This is the dream of one Dr.Maxis, British, America, Russian, Japanese, French members. Including one Dr.Edward Richtofen. Edward was the apprentice of Dr.Maxis and shadowed him for many years, aspiring to one day be head of group 935 and to be as intelligent as Maxis.
One of group 935’s projects was teleportation the scientists wanted to see if it was possible to transfer matter from one location to another. Up to the second world war this goal seemed impossible due to lack of funding and technology. 935 had bases all over the globe including the base in shi-no-numa, Griffon station was one of 935’s most acclaimed achievements a research facility on the moon.
A meteor crash landed just outside the perimeter of the shi-no-numa facility and was quickly brought in for samples and readings to be taken to 935’s amazement the rock code name 115 was giving off some kind of electromagnetic radiation 935 predicted that if harnessed correctly could control electrical bonds between atoms and help reach their goal of teleportation. Shi-no-numa was now used as a ware house to share out the element with other bases including griffon station.
Soon war broke out and the entire world was at each other’s throats, The Nazis.
Maxis had several secret meetings with the Reich command and came to an agreement 935 would be provided with everything it needed as long as it put all its research into weapons and ways to win the war although Maxis did not agree he had no choice he appointed Dr.Porter to create a weapon of supreme power. Porter was one of 935’s top weapon designers and using 115 created the ray gun the Nazi party were happy with the creation but desired more
Richtofen approached Maxis several times on the sudden change of research being conducted. Maxis explained because he trusted Richtofen, this annoyed Richtofen and left him aiming for more he wanted to transport human.
Richtofen spent weeks re-calibrating the teleportation devices and when he thought it was ready for human test subject he offered himself as a lab rat. He powered up the machine
He spoke stories of a cave were he found a black pyramid that spoke to him it had remarkable ancient symbols engraved around it and he wanted to open it everything he done was to open that pyramid. Soon the pyramid was brought to griffon station and upon someone touching it activated. A clear tube rose up from the corner and by mere coincidence a rat was found on the base because of contamination Richtofen order it to be killed and when it was something happened. Reports say ‘its soul left the body and was trapped in the tube’… Richtofen finally knew how to open it.
Meanwhile Maxis had recently been ordered to by the Nazi party to create spies so good no one would ever suspect them. At first Maxis tried normal German spy’s but found them to be ‘incompetent’ he then went on to use brainwashing on POW’s although it worked better the effects wore off quickly. He then turnt to brainwashing with help off 115. Maxis was given 3 test subjects an American a Russian and a Japanese when the results were reported back to the German high command the Nazis no longer wanted spy’s they wanted super solders the reports said that the test subjects physical condition had improved greatly and there ability in the field would be immense. The Nazi’s wanted every soldier to be like this because it was to be done on such a large scale the process had to be shortened and because the subjects did not need to be brainwashed the results were different each test subject showed heightened aggression and lack of cognitive functions and recognition basically it was angry didn’t know what it was doing and didn’t know who anyone was.
