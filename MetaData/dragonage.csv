- ***[Kinlochhold Mods Her Game](http://kinlochhold.tumblr.com/post/50097911708/kinlochhold-mods-her-game-master-post)***

---

**Game Play and Environment**:

- [Improved Atmosphere](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/577) - Thanks /u/cirion5!
**Important Note**: Imrpoved Atmosphere can sometimes cause missing thumbnails. The fix for that can be found [here](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/826). Thanks to /u/Ganrao for pointing this out.
- [Dragon Age Redesigned](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/686) – Adds a lot of environmental changes
- [Character Respecialization](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/14) - Adds a raven to most areas with free respec potions.
- [Lock Bash](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/301) - Bash through locks on chests and doors you can't pick.
- [No Helmet Hack](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/202) - Hide helmets for your party.
- [Beyond Ferelden Chest](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/61) - A storage chest for your party camp.
- [Sleeping Tent](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/735) – A tent for your Warden in camp. Note: This appears to spawn in the same location as the chest
- [Dalish Elves Beautified](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1343)
- [Skip the Fade](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/816) - Gives you all the same stat points
- [Forced Deathblows](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/220) - Because deathblows are awesome. Can also be used to turn off deathblows almost completely.
- [Auto-Loot](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/28) - Screw the dialogue box.
- [Dalish Mage Origin](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/764)
- [Dragon Age Class and Specialization Pack](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1399)
- [Awakening in the OC](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/920) - Adds the essential features of Awakening to the base game. I would **not** recommend this for beginners. It's very easy to mess up your game and likely has a slough of comparability issues.
- ***[Sleep Until Dawn](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/3722)*** - Lets your Warden go to bed (including some interaction with your love interest)
- ***[Beat the Hell out of Howe](http://social.bioware.com/project/3746/#files)*** - For all your Human Noble vengeance needs.

- [Two Spec Sten](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/486) - Because he somehow only gets one Specialization point.
- [MADD Gift Guide](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/385) - Adds a notation of the intended companion for preferred gifts. Be warned: it spoils the identity of the Mystery Companion if you've never finished the game before.
- [Make Console Commands Visible](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1110) - Some mods and game bug fixes require you to type things into the console
- [Advanced Tactics](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/181) - Fixes and deepens the tactics system.
- [Combat Tweaks](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/354) - Smooths out skills and makes them balanced. Makes some of the more terrible skills actually useful.
- [White Teeth](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/44) - Because some of the teeth textures are really distracting.
- [Symmetrical Massive Armor](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/836) - This mod was actually made by our very own /u/svk151! Lets you pick one shoulder style and one glove style for the Massive armor.
- ***[Effects Handler](http://social.bioware.com/project/2715/)*** - Includes quite a few handy tweaks and removes effects out of combat.

- [Sacred Ashes Companions](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/463) - Updates Morrigan
- [Morrigan Sacred Ashes Robes](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1902) - Replaces Morrigan's armor with her kickass trailer armor. Especially useful if you're not a fan of her vanilla

**New Companion**:

- [Ser Gilmore NPC](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/851) - Someone went through and completely fleshed out Ser Gilmore from the Human Noble origin to make him a companion. It's not voiced by the same actor for the rest of the game
- [Ser Gilmore for Awakening](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/3210) is also available. With continuity.
- [Karmas Origins Companions](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1617) - Lets you recruit pretty much anyone

- ***[Alistair's Nightmare](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/3723)*** - This is a companion mod for Sleep Until Dawn

1. The combat. I love the tactics system. I love pausing and deciding what the party member will do. I am not good at combat in other games; it tends to move too quickly for me to think. This allows time for me to breathe and decide what I want to do next!

2. I love the NPC personalities - they seem so fully realized and interesting. Also the party banter is so fun.

3. I love the art style. I have modded it up some with better textures but I loved the way the game looked without it - now it just looks better.

4. I love the Origins. I played the Mage one, period.

First I will have to apologize for an inconvenience. When I opened up Qualtrics today I saw that 305 people had answered the survey, sorry for that. Also the graphs aren't that pretty as hoped, I had to use a web-based program as lifesaver.

[So without further ado

Note that I did not include some questions of the survey

Reading through the comments was pretty interesting. The points frequently brought up were:

* Return of old characters (Alistair and Morrigan were specificially requested several times

* A polished game; no repeated dungeons

* Story-wise the hivemind wants to go back to how things were in Origins

* More character interactions, ideas like a Chasind character were brought up.

* Decisions should weigh more again and actually affect the story ending.

* Less plot devices

* Hawke and the Warden need to make a reappearance.

* Possibility to interrupt conversations like in Mass Effect.

If you still have questiones feel free to ask!

Origins was great stuff, I found the game reminiscent of Star Wars: KOTOR in all of the best ways possible. I loved the characters and the scale of the world, the writing was excellent, the gameplay was challenging, and there was so much to see and do! I thought the graphics could have been better from a technical perspective, the plot was somewhat simple, and a game ending glitch almost made me give up (my Xbox kept freezing on the Archdemon fight :( )

Dragon Age 2 is obviously a very different beast, but I thought it was a lot more gratifying. It was fast, flashy, and fun, and I liked how some of the mechanics were streamlined with potion and poison making. Spending hours in the Tactics screen felt great because I could almost play it as fast paced action game (I know it's not what many of the fans wanted, but I appreciated it!) The characters were just about as good as Origins in my opinion. Merrill is one of my new favorite characters, Varric was hilarious throughout (I loved his nicknames for your squadmates), dungeon, and I'd get ticked every time a rock wall was mysteriously blocking off the door in a cave I had just been in a little while ago.

I guess I'm asking if anyone whilst roleplaying on the templar side of things has ever felt it was really the better or morally more acceptable option.

This may be due to the fact that I really enjoyed playing as a mage

Apart from that it always seemed to me that the templars are portrayed consistently as overzealous 'captors'. Looking at your party from DA:O you have a cynical ex-templar, and an elder mage who has a spirit inhabit her.

I think my first playthrough of these games being a mage Warden/Hawke and generally being diplomatic and heroic has made it unlikely for me to actively help the templars in the coming war.

what was the reason for this decline in quality? simply put, a total of 6 year, with atleast 3 or 4 dedicated to post concepts, and actual development of the game engine. 

Dragon age 2 started development in late 2009, with an estimated *one year* of work on the actual engine. This is obviously a drastic decline in time of development, and the results show.

Some blame EA for the time restraints

Dragon age 3 started development approximately slightly before, and there has yet to be an official announcement, and only rumors, speculation, and minor details. 

In fact

With much of the lore already set down, that could go back to the quality of Origins.

Alright. I checked if this has been asked before and I didn't find anything which I found surprising.

I wanted to talk/ask what you think about... the idol. Made out of red lyrium. First of all why does it have such power and normal lyrium doesn't? Why has something like this never been mentioned so far until Hawk stumbles upon the idol? I had to go to the wiki to find a bit more information on it. We all know the story of Bartrand and Meredith going insane due to being in contact with it BUT the main thing I wanted to ask/talk about is its' ability to animate objects or statues as it is in DA2. What do you think about it?

After some time and one and a half playthroughs of DA2 I suddenly remembered what Caridin once said: To animate his golems he needed souls of living creatures. I was curious about this because apparently this red

&gt; *It is known to give its user supernatural abilities at the cost of their sanity.It also seems to greatly enhance any magical abilities in its possessor

I also had... another idea: What if... the magisters of Tevinter actually used THIS kind of lyrium to get to the golden/black city? Seeing what such a small idol could do

I also really wanted to give an explanation to the ""singing"" Bartrand was hearing but I've got nothing. I found it interesting because both Bartrand and the Mother who were insane referred to some sort of ""song"" which they craved to hear again. But I'm dry. Maybe I'm just trying to turn the nothing into something. Ideas? I love reading people's opinions here... well most of them.

**TL;DR:** Okay
It was known that red lyrium is super powerful
Could the magisters at Tevinters have used the red lyrium to get into the golden/black city?

WHEW. Redditing is hard.

WARNING: Wall of Text

tl;dr: Shits about to go down


At the end of DA: O, according to a survey made about a month ago [the vast majority of players had their Warden survive](/spoiler), (link to survey will be in comments). 

Regardless of the battle against the Archdemon, [a sentient darkspawn, with great plans for his race](/spoiler). His plans have already been seen with [Mother, and the Disciples, sentient darkspawn, created by using the blood of Grey Wardens](/spoiler), and during the Final Battle of Awakening, before the blight could begin

At the end of Witch Hunt [the player has a number of ways to deal with Morrigan, whether through the obvious, or through grief, as they come to terms with [Morrigan's fate](/spoiler)

Without further ado

When the dust settles from the actions of Hawke in Act 3 of DA2, respectively)](/spoiler). With the [Mage/Templar War](/spoiler) in it's opening stages, the possibility of the Fade being torn open all across Thedas is possible [as observed in the Blackmarsh in Awakening](/spoiler). 

Finally we move onto Sandal, innocent Sandal. Whose importance may not even be recognized by the Chantry. After Hawke moves into his/her estate in Act 2 of DA2, Sandal has something very dark to say (link to youtube clip will be in comments). Here is the largest part of the prophecy and maybe the most important [""One day the magic will come back. All of it. Everyone will be just like they were. The shadows will part, and the skies will open wide.""](/spoiler), Sandal seems to predict that long ago [everyone had magic, human, elf, the only major event that could possibly take the magic away was the [Tevintir Magisters entering the Golden City of the Maker

Now back to the [Architect, if it was said at all, [but iirc someone or something talks of the terrible beauty of the Archdemons' song, and the way it draws in the darkspawn](/spoiler). With the [disciples, and Architect creating darkspawn free from the call of the Archdemons, it can be believed that the sound will be magnified to those who remain, giving them a larger desire to find the two remaining Archdemons, one of the first darkspawn

So far, as the players know of? A few jump to mind, Flemeth, Maric [Alistair is currently searching for Maric as well, leading to my belief that Alistair could also being searched for](/spoiler), I should note that [I am, not counting the Hero or Hawke as both are already being searched for](/spoiler), whoever the player sided with at the end of Legacy to discover the fate of [Corypheus, even in the areas they once had full control over. Further travelling into the Deeproads could bring the player in contact with a [sentient darkspawn](/spoiler) who believes that the Architect's plans are causing things to stir, and cease tensions between Orlais and Ferelden](/spoiler).

I've already cherry picked some of the most interesting tiddly-bits that I came across while reading. I'm currently halfway through the book and should be done by the time I wake up tomorrow to (hopefully) answer questions. Here are some interesting things I've learned:

* The Alamarri tribes that would eventually become Fereldans crossed the Frostback Mountains in -2415 Ancient

* Intelligent

* Nevarra, seems to be mostly inspired by Prussia (if we hold the other Free Marcher states to be similar to pre-Imperial German states, Nevarra becoming a nation and going to war with the setting's France-analogue marks it as Prussia) though with some Dutch influence (nobles have the word ""Van"" in their names, and their low-lying city of Cumberland has a somewhat Amsterdam feel) and strangely, Egyptian, because the nation mummifies their dead. A group mage-priests known as the Mortalitasi who originated with the Tevinter advisor to Nevarra's first king, preside over mummification of the dead and advising nobles of the nation, cultists or blood mages. Nevarran families often construct elaborate tombs for their dead and the ""Great Necropolis"" outside of Nevarra city is almost as large as the city itself.

* Seems like Antiva has some Arabic or Indian influence, if it's a made up word like ""teyrn"" or not.

* The island of Estwatch in the Amaranthine has a surprising amount of lore for something not mentioned before this book. Once a Tevinter stronghold, along with Llomerryn. I get the feeling that it is either going to appear in DAIII or was intended to appear in the scrapped DAII expansion, what with DAII's focus on pirates through Isabela.

* Due to the close ties between the Dwarves and Tevinter Empires, Laetan mages, mages who are born to nonmagical parents or otherwise non-ancient mage bloodlines, Soporati, the non-mage citizens, and slaves, with the subclass of freed slaves known as Liberati), with some dwarves spending their entire lives within the embassy. All dwarves in the Imperium

* Par Vollen, there are preserved and mathematically perfect pyramids aligned with the constitutions which have hieroglyphics that featured horned figures, leading some to speculate that these humans may have welcomed the Qunari as gods. This civilization may be the ""Fex"" Gaider alluded to in a PAX East interview ages ago.

* Gryphons are native to Seheron

* Those who die in the service of the chantry in an exalted march are known as ""Exalted"" and receive a special place at the side of the maker according to the chantry. The ""Anointed"", founder of the Andrastian Chantry and worshiped almost equally with Andraste within Orlais

* According to the book

* There are both male and female priests in the Imperial Chantry, much like Tevinter politics.

* Kal-Sharok does not recognize the king of Orzammar, but great promises of what they will do when leading their people. Rather than get monumental statues, Kal-Sharok's paragons are honored with carvings.",,False,self,t5_2r8lo,,http://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1e250a/iama_guy_who_has_a_copy_of_world_of_thedas_ama/

1311702047.0,j0c7o,Dragon Age 2: Legacy review,wseeg,47,8,25,"First of all let me say I really liked *Dragon Age: Origins*

Also

*Legacy* is the first quest based DLC for the widely panned *Dragon Age 2*. Priced at $10, you pick your party and are all of the sudden in a desert. The DLC starts off a little slow and plain, seeming much like most quests in *2*. Once I got ""underground"", though, I found myself filled with the same awe from first heading into the Deep Roads or finding Andraste's Tomb in *DA:O*. *Legacy* is a bonafide dungeon crawl, and a pretty good one at that. The dungeon aims to shower you in loot, as you find tons of good items for all your classes, the setting is a lot of fun, allowing you to hack and slash through monsters to get to a point where a tactical pause allows you to make the most of your next move. I played on Hard and only died once. I've got some air tight tactics programmed for my party though

There's not a lot of character development in this DLC, and Fenris, no one ever gained friendship or rivalry points based on my actions, even though their dialogue made it pretty clear how they felt about situations. I'm glad they don't mess with that actually, because there's plenty of that going on in Kirkwall. It's nice to take whoever you want to go bash some heads without worrying about the moral consequences. The plot has a few side quests that in my opinion sort of fizzle out, but are at the very least interesting for a time. The main plot is just fine, giving you a choice to make between two big things

So is *Legacy* worth the $10? Hard to say

Will *Legacy* make *DA:O* die hards see the light when it comes to *DA2*? Probably not. The whole point of *Legacy* is to add some spice to the main game, if you played through *DA2* planning to never touch it again, but get a craving for a good old fashioned *DA:O* dungeon crawl, *Legacy* will definitely scratch that itch.

I am also guilty of this. Really, the Anvil of the Void really is worth saving. The dwarves have been caged in a corner since the advent of the Darkspawn, only gaining respite during the relatively short period of time when golems were accessible. Were the Anvil of the Void to be recovered, perhaps the Darkspawn could be hunted down and wiped out, thus preventing another Blight from ever even occurring.

However, including her lover, Hespith, to find it. Clearly, she is deluded, consumed and corrupted in pursuit of the Anvil.

Opposite her is Caridin, it is easy to come to the conclusion that too many souls have been lost to the Anvil, and no more should be risked.

However, yes, but that risk is no greater than, say, sparing the potentially demon-possessed mages at the Circle of Magi.

When Irving tells the templars that the Circle is clear of demons

Pity. Both the mages and Caridin are parties victimized by circumstance. The mages were attacked by demons

As I said, though, they do somewhat oppose each other on an ideological level.

1374883359.0,1j4qwl,Companion predictions for Inquisiton: Getting the band back together (spoilers),Pattonesque,39,6,69,"Bioware have their issues, I think we can make some pretty reasonable predictions for what the party's going to look like

* You'll have at least six companions

* At least two will be warriors -- one sword-and-shield

* At least two will be rogues -- one dual-wielder

* At least two will be mages -- one healing-focused

* At least one will be a dwarf

* There will probably be one or two redundancies -- you had two two-handed warriors (and Shale) in Origins and two archers in DA2 (plus whichever sibling is still alive).

It's likely that at least a few characters who've already been established will show up as party members in Inquisition, Isabela, and I think Sebastian for Hawke, and everyone except Sten, Morrigan, Oghren, and Leliana for the Warden), I doubt they'd put a formerly-dead character in your party. That'd be a bit too on-the-nose in dispelling the illusion that your choices matter.

Anyway

* **Sten** is busy being the new Arishok (if they stick the comic canon

* **Morrigan** is probably going to be playing an NPC role

* **Leliana** is probably too busy being a Seeker

* **Oghren** has already been a companion in two games

* **Sebastian** might work if he's a Chantry brother

* **Isabela** is probably out 'cause she's a former romance option for Hawke

* **Aveline** is secretly one of my favorites from DA2

We know from the trailer that two DA2 characters will show up in Inquisition: Cassandra and Varric.

* **Cassandra** feels like a maybe to me. You could use her for either warrior slot, so maybe as an allied general.

* **Varric**, we still don't know *that* much about him so there's room for more character development, and he was probably the most well-received character from DA2. He's your rogue archer and possibly one of your first companions.

As for temporary party members or former NPCs

* **Tallis** had an entire DLC dedicated to her, and aside from a half-assed bit in MOTA is not romantically attached to a previous NPC. Plus, the post-MOTA codex entry on her is explicit about saying that Hawke is ""sure we haven't seen the last of Tallis"". 

* **Cullen** is inexplicably a fan favorite (he's OK, can probably be easily removed from where we last saw him in Kirkwall, gives the player a Templar perspective, and could be introduced early, which fits perfectly as a sword-and-shield warrior.

Long-shots:

* **Finn** seems like a good fit considering he's an expert on Eluvians

* **Velanna** never actually died in Awakening, though. EDIT: someone pointed out that you can gank her when you first meet her. Oh well!

The final roster could look like anything, or Cullen will be a companion, with possibly more than one. YMMV. I'm sure I'm missing something obvious the rest of y'all will quickly point out.",,False,self,t5_2r8lo,,http://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1j4qwl/companion_predictions_for_inquisiton_getting_the/

I recently finished Dragon Age II for the second time. For all its flaws, i felt the companions were (for the most part) very well fleshed out in DA II. There were shades of grey. Take Merrill. Merrill is nice, sweet, working hard toward her goal of restoring her clan and never failing to look out for her friends as well. She doesn't presume much, and is generally very friendly. She's also a blood mage who's convinced dealing with demons is the way to go. So it's hard to easily slip Merrill into the usual good/bad category.

Or, and clearly harbors some anti-mage tendencies. But he also, critically, has doubts. The doubts make the characters. Flaws make characters.

Unfortunately, even ignoring this is like demanding all Chechnyans in America must die after the Boston bombings, either Hawke is a mage, and it makes no sense to side with Meredith, or Hawke's sister is a mage, and Hawke might in some scenarios be forced to kill his/her sister. I really felt like it wasn't much of a choice.

The writers obviously felt this way too, I think it made the ending worse. Instead of grey vs grey, you have black vs black. A crazy genocidal maniac vs a crazy genocidal blood mage. I finished the game by going: I hate everyone, so why should I be invested in Meredith vs Orsino? Why should I care about their squabble? They are both awful.

See, but couldn't succeed in their main antagonists. If Cullen was the Knight-Commander, and Anders was the first enchanter, then they would both be GREY characters. And I might have felt that siding with the Templars was sensible, rather than idiotic.

I looked up if Bioware has addressed this at all, a ""preset name"" means that your character will be given a default name that people will address you as, such as Hawke or Shepard. So, I'm not quite sure what he meant in that tweet.

Now, since it *is* called ""dragon age"" after all. Most specifically, the blood of dragons is called the ""blood of the earth"" by Yavana, a witch of the wilds and one of Flemeth's daughters, and that King Calenhad drank the blood of a dragon during a ritual provided over by Flemeth to become a super-powerful reaver and use that power to unite Fereldan.

Now, but dragons nonetheless, and it is this dragon blood which seemingly allows them to keep their wits and not become ghouls immediately (perhaps being related to the ability of Archdemons to maintain their intelligence when tainted and lead blights, and also the self-awareness of Disciples). Grey Wardens, then, are theoretically just as influenced by dragons as they are darkspawn.

Now, if they are Flemeth's biological daughters, could therefore also have the blood of dragons in them, much like how Calenhad's blood was passed down to Cailan, Maric and Alistair. If the seal on the Grey Warden scrolls were somehow set to react to the presence of *dragon blood* in the Wardens, it could be that Flemeth or Morrigan were able to open the seals.

What other similarities could a Witch of the Wilds have to a Grey Warden due to possibly having dragon blood in their system? How would a witch of the wilds react to being tainted, one who definitely does and one who could have a *triple* dose. There's Alistair, of the dragon-empowered Theirin bloodline, and also the Old God Baby, who's the son of a potentially dragon-blooded Witch of the Wilds, a dragon-blood enhanced warden, and said warden could potentially be the already double-dragon-blooded (say that three times fast) Alistair.


Some stuff to think about


EDIT: I just remembered two more things: one, and two, if the Warden so chose, he could take Kolgrim's offer to drink dragon blood and become a reaver himself, so that could also bring about more implications on the amount of dragon blood in the OGB's system, potentially.",,self,29,
1367099885.0,1d8l75,Solo Nightmare Shapeshifter. No AW. No primal magic. No kiting.,Belthazzar,37,11,8,"Hey guys

Ultimate Edition came out on Steam so I bought it since I had DA only on console and it was one of my favorite games at the time (havent played for a good year and a half though :P)

So I created new character and went on. During Loethering, my best was walking bomb kite build, which I accidently deleted). 
I have put on myself couple limitations.

* No primal magic. My first nightmare finish was on mage who just spammed primal spells. Too easy. Too boring.

* No AW. All my mages had first or second spec AW. Even though there is no way to make my character look good in robes, **still wearing robes+staff**.

* No kiting. I kited enough. It's time to play like a man.

* Potions allowed. I know many people want to do potionless solo runs

And since everybody says that Magic Shapeshifter sucks
And I have to admit one thing. Shapeshifter is *amazing*.

For the build:

First and foremost, so I use magic to kill things. When I face big groups, I have created new cheese.
**Death Magic + Death Cloud + Force Field**

Death Magic is great since it works in Force Field. Death Cloud is freaking badass spell. It feels epic everytime I cast down this blackness. Run into it's centre like I have no fear. And then Force Fielding myself looking at those fools lost in darkness dying. *Slowly*.

This kills every white-level mob and brings under 50% HP yellow ones. 

Then it's time for Shapeshifting.

Shapeshifing is incredible in one scenario: dueling. Switching between spider and bear can make fights quite easy even vs strongest opponets (you know the vial guy in Mage Tower? He was my nightmare since he always instakilled my characters. But he didnt instakill bearman). Every form is amazing even before lvl 12. And with Overwhelm. Oh my.

For attributes I just yank everything into Magic (+couple points into cunning. I like to persuade people)

For items:
I have everything I can with +healing effects (currently I have +35%)
Rest it's mostly magic&gt;everything else.

Progress:
Mage Tower done (f*** templars).
Orzammar halfway done.
Redcliff 1/3 done (yeah I tend to travel)
bunch of dlcs done.

So far nothing was really problematic. My biggest challenge was the bounty hunter fight right when you want to enter Orzammar. Those guys hurt for how long they live. But the kill on them was really spectacular imo.
I casted Deathcloud on top of them right before they engaged me. Then I ran in near the mage. In the second he casted Fireball, who got eaten by spiderman. Whole fight took just few moments, but I reloaded there couple dozen times just to get perfect position on the mage to die within the cloud. If he didnt cast first fireball, the plan wouldnt work, because he would walk out of the cloud and I wouldnt survive.

For example Sten's companions that you meet in the Fade in his nightmare. Sure they could be born the same as him but it really seems odd since that ""born with no horns"" thing is from what I've heard very rare. Also there are alot of Mercenaries that are Qunari, I mean, they arn't following any of the rules of the Qun anyways, so why not keep the horns?

Now, but it simply isn't in the same realm that the Dragon Age franchise resides in.

Bethesda and Bioware have separate and incredibly unique talents.

Bethesda-with its games like Skyrim and Fallout- know that people buy their games for the massive open worlds they make with such ease, at least for me.

Bioware knows that the characters who fill the world are just as important-if not more so- than the world itself. The Jarls, nor when I pillaged villages. There was too much world and not enough substance to it.

I loved the fighting style in Dragon Age 2. The expansions started to add in more tactics to it but the quality of the fighting styles got better with DA2. Dragon Age Origins may have had more realism for great sword fighters but let's not beat the realism drum. We are fighting creatures that have been shat out from various fantasy races because we drank blood and a large corrupted dragon is pissed at us. 

I will use the Rogue as an example. I didn't mind the tactic of having to get behind and stay behind someone. It added a bit of realism and tactics that I personally hadn't found in a recent rpg. If you went with a bow

My only problem with fighting with daggers in DA:O was that you basically became a fighter with daggers about 3/4 of the way through. This carried over to the expansions for DA:O as well. Dragon Age 2 offered fast paced fighting that made you keep up with everything and everyone around you. It much harder to do in DA:2 in my own opinion but by far more fun. I felt like a ninja in Dragon Age 2. (fantasy hollywood style ninja mind you) From dropping a smoke bomb and popping up behind someone to stab them to going into stealth and attacking from the shadows. It was fast and fun. 

For two handed fighters you took a beating early in DA:O because heaven help you if you missed a swing and you were fighting someone with two weapons. They would get in about four hits before you could come back around for the next swing. It was ponderous and slow but I did build a character and had a ton of fun with it. DA:2 brought fast fighting with this style to. I felt like Conan swinging my sword. Cutting through enemies and leaping through the air to attack the next group. Hitting them all at once and swinging so hard I could hit someone a few steps back. (they had that in both DA:O and DA2). 

To me it was an overall improvement on the whole fighting part of the game. My one and only complaint was that they took out two weapon fighters. I looked forward to using the two weapon style but with the updated style of DA2. I was pissed when I didn't find it. I tried the two handed great sword warrior and I was pleased. I still miss the two weapon fighting style. No Drizzt for DA2. Hopefully 3 will have this. 

How they can expand on the fighting roles is a mystery to me. I want two weapons to make a come back for DA3. I would love to see the movements and attacks for this style. High damage and lower defense is fine with me. Especially when it would be a room clearer. Killing faster than a two handed fighter would be fun to see.

I want to see more styles added to the current ones. They did this for Mark of the Assassin. I have not played this yet. I did read where Talia had her own fighting style and it was something they would have added in future expansions. Hopefully 3 will bring more styles. I loved the jump in fighting styles.

So.  Assuming that I take DA2 as a stand-alone game, relationship, and companion-wise, with Mass Effect 2 and 3?

First off, mythology, and world. I won't spend time on the cons (repetitiveness, same maps every freakin' time, bugs up the wahoo, etc.), which have all been discussed in detail elsewhere.

**Romance**

I appreciated having all the romanceable (except for Sebastian) characters available no matter whether I played a male or female Hawke. Of course, and your female choices are Weirdo Jitteryelf or Sleazy Nopants... but I appreciated the effort.

I was bummed that the two most appealing companion characters (Varric and Aveline) were not available romantically. In my mind

**Companions**

They all grew on me. I was a big Alistair fangirl and at first I missed having a sweet goofball in the bunch

* Fenris. I like playing mages, he grew on me. Partially because I love his voice.

* Anders. Oh, 'shit, he's got the gaatlok formula and he's gonna blow up the Gallows!' Then when he asked for help distracting the grand cleric, I actually said out loud, 'you dumb fuck!'. 

* Merrill. Creeped me out. But her story really is kind of tragic. Definitely was more sympathetic on the second play. Also

* Isabela. My least favorite companion. I should try using her more to see if she's got any redeeming qualities. Right now

* Aveline. I looooove Aveline! I think the love began when she said

* Varric. If he was romanceable

**Setting/theories**

Templars... I was under the impression from Origins (and correct me if I'm wrong) that Templars, and the scene in the Circle tower where the templar is being tempted by the desire demon. She doesn't tempt him with money or sex or power, but with a wife and children. A home. Then also there's Cullen's distress over the appearance of the Warden (if you played a female mage warden). 

Like I said before, grooves built into the sewers for blood to flow), that the city is laid out in a series of glyphs and signs, and ends by implying some Forgotten One god or demon is behind it all.  

Then Hawke ends up delving deeper into the Deep Roads than anyone and discovering a primeval thaig

Then Leliana says the Elthina has to leave because they have intel that outside forces are at work and her life is in danger. 

So then is Anders just a mere pawn in some greater game? (Which would only make his story more tragic.) After all

Speaking of Anders, ffs] GAVE to him)? When did he merge with Justice? How did he go from goofy goofball to Ragey Magepants in... no time at all?     

**Superficial shallowness**


The hair... Oh Maker

The clothing choices for mages are fuuuuug-ly up till you get the Champion robes.

Knight-Captain Cullen. Love. Him. I'd dig a game with him as a companion/romanceable option. Just sayin'.

The choices I made on my favourite play through were: 
I was a Dwarf Noble Warrior out wanted to join the wardens and then was exiled from my kingdom. A pond leaving Lothering I went to get my Elvish allies. I helped the Eleves, even though he had betrayed me. The reason I did this was because Harrowmont would make a poor king. He is too caught up in tradition, where Bhelen would be the more beneficial choice to have for the Dwarven race to survive. I also destroyed the Anvil for the sole reason of it would cause more harm than good to my people. I then went to Denerim and put Alistar on the throne alongside with Anora and made Loghain take the joining. In the final battle I made Loghain take the killing blow against the arch demon to redeem his sins. The only boon I asked for was support against the darkspawn; With Bhelen taking his reforms he already would have pushed the darkspawn back with the support of the Humans, the Dwarfs could finally take back a large chunk of the deep roads.

Times have changed since then. Most of the new exciting games are released on consoles and I've long since switched my main gaming platform to Xbox360 and PS3.

Here is my dilemma. I truly don't know which of these three platforms I should get this game for. Judging from what I've seen so far PC seems like the best option - keyboard and mouse just fit these games really well. Then again

1375546087.0,1jmq4n,So I'm finally playing Dragon Age 2 [Spoilers]...,Kitten_Pryde,39,18,39,"Originally I was holding out, but it was impossible to me. It's like playing Mass Effect 1 again. I hated the game play, but decided against it. Playing even part of DA:O was extremely helpful since I know a lot of things

Some things I enjoyed so far:

* The characters. Some I hate, I do miss Morrigan... and my dog Hades.

* Hawke has a voice! I hated not having a voice as the Warden in DA:O

* The dialogue wheel was pretty helpful

* The game play is fun. I kinda wrecked my A button on one controller when I got too heated in a battle. What? My sister was in danger. Anyway

* The length of the game is great. I know I'm nearing the end

* Family. I thought that was a great addition. I know I had a family in DA:O, I had no idea where to go because the map was so bad. Anyway, I actually grew attached to my sister and mother, but my brother can go eat some shit. I never liked him.

* The map as

* Toggle-able helmets. I have never once seen a cool helmet

* The default faces. I normally love making my characters, and blue eyes, like Hawke's, and some kind of marking or tattoo on their face, like Hawke's. I love it. I wish more games gave that hair style for girls.

Some things I wish that were changed/different/bothered me:

* For some reason

* Like Leliana in DA:O, and Leliana in DA:O by pure luck, and Isabela ended up being a favorite of mine. I'd be pissed if I missed her. I just want some warning, that's all.

* Copy/Paste caves/environments in general. Sure, but I really hated how it was all just... the same.

* Gifts. Sure, I miss having mounds and mounds of gifts I'd throw at them. Fun.

* One of these battles made me want to chuck my Xbox out the window. I have no idea why that one ass-wipe {Can't remember his name} was so tough

* 0 sexual preferences. Sure that worked to my favor

* Armor ratings are so obscure. Isabela wears cloth. Literal cloth. There is one actual armor piece

* As far as I know, and got the chest plate {Final piece I needed, I was holding out on killing the high dragon} and went from 200-300 something AR to 618 AR.

* Losing Bethany. I thought I had it *all* figured out. I thought that I had the best team ever. Then they took Bethany from me and threw her in the Circle. She literally was all I ever wanted in a mage, but she's a piss-poor replacement at that. I've seen Beth twice since she got taken, and not a single one had been either and epic reunion or her finally joining me again.

I'll spruce up the list a bit later

Edit: Just finished the game

Liked:

* The final battles were nice. Like

* I had Beth back. It may have been for one battle

* I forgot to mention this before

Disliked:

* I have no idea what happened to Hawke. Varric just said that all split up, kinda disappointed me. Then there was 10 seconds of Leliana it looked and sounded like. I have no idea if there are multiple endings or not, but if there are, I either got the horribly bad ending, or the best ending. Everyone lived, so I guess it's the best?

* 0 time to prep for the final battle. There were no red flags being flared. I was running low on health potions and I thought I was just going to settle an argument, I was just thrown into battle.

* They never really elaborated on Sandal... which was a bit disappointing since he... you know... killed all those blood-magic things.",self,t5_2r8lo,1375559141.0,,1,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1jmq4n/so_im_finally_playing_dragon_age_2_spoilers/

But Dragon Age is different. You play as three different characters in the main games. But you are still you. You have the same morals and ideas about the goings on in Thedas. I personally abhor blood magic and don't use it. I was also merciful in both games. Basically they are how I would act. But they're different people

Also

Now to my thoughts on the issue. Would it be possible to import other peoples save games via the Dragon Age servers? This would open up different quests and surprises waiting for you in DA:I. You could upload your save games and use someone elses saves for your game. This would be a feature you could opt out of if you weren't comfortable with it of course.

I am currently making a character for the Dragon Age RPG. I want to ensure my background is all lore appropriate

Is it conceivable that a male noble would deny their own male child born to a duster?

Is it conceivable that a duster woman would hide the fact their son is noble born or would pretty much any duster woman jump at the chance to enter the noble class?

Basically I want a character born from the rape of a casteless woman by a warrior caste but he does not want the son immediately. He later changes his mind after the child is older but the mother has hidden the child and the father kills the child's mother and adoptive father.

1365279701.0,1btaoz,Your opinions on the ethics and consequences of 'hardening'. DA:O,Katow-joismycousin,22,5,20,"This is a difficult moral choice for me during the course of this game. See here for a brief explanation: http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Hardened.

Playing the game a  bit of a 'good guy' my first instinct on this one was to leave my friends unhardened. It seemed it was just a way of making them assholes and willing to go along with deviant behaviour.

Now I am undecided based on what I have seen and read. Is hardening bad? One of the things I like about this game is that there is no generic good/evil morality system as in so many Bioware (among others) RPG's. There are actions and consequences. Sometimes there are even no consequences if you don't get caught!

So let's discuss this shall we? Alistair is a sweet and kind of dopey guy with a strong sense of right and wrong that borders on the naive. Yet even he admits when you meet him that the Wardens must do extreme things to stop the Blight. His actions lack conviction though. As I was playing mostly 'good guy' I usually managed to keep him sweet but when I tried to recruit Loghain he let his personal vendetta get in the way. If the PC was actually being morally flexible for the sake of pragmatism that would be one thing

I was disappointed. Even in the page linked above it mentions a consequence of 'hardening' to be him being more inclined to put personal feeling ahead of duty

As for Leliana I think her faith is touching, religion seems more dangerous in the long run than allowing her to embrace her love of adventure and intrigue.

So what say you people? Does 'hardening' have a bad rep? Could it simply be a way of convincing your capable but misguided companions that all is not well with their naive world views? You could argue the cause of opening their minds and setting them free! Or is this just giving them an excuse to be dicks?

Instead, I'm crafting interactions that aren't in the game, and I have to admit that it's fun.  Below, while the Warden and her companions are in Sloth's domain in the Fade.  I truly hope you enjoy.

-----------------
When Anlessa awoke, and she found herself smiling just by looking around the room… her room.  A light buzzing from the foot of the bed drew her attention, and she peeked over the footboard to see her Mabari dozing away on the rug, bathing in a pool of sunlight.

Anlessa grinned and slipped out of bed, then snarled, powerful jaws snapping fruitlessly as she laughed and hid her face behind his great neck, her arms wrapped tightly beneath his forelegs.

“You’re so ferocious!” she mocked

Finally submitting to his mistress,” she responded to his plaintive barks, “We’ll go get breakfast from Nan shortly.  Hold your horses.”

Anlessa threw open her wardrobe to decide what to wear for the day, trying to ignore an itching at the base of her skull that was making her uneasy, and more than a bit uncomfortable.  Something wasn’t quite right – what was it?  Sharp barks from her hound drew her out of her reverie, and a commanding knock sounded on her door.

“Anlessa!” cried a voice from the corridor outside

The voice was familiar

“Mother…?”

The door opened and the matron of the Cousland clan stepped in with every bit of poise and propriety that Anlessa had remembered her bearing.  Her steel grey hair was tightly pulled into an intricate and elegantly braided bun at the back of her head, dear girl.  You look like you’ve seen a ghost.  Did you have that nightmare, again?”

Anlessa watched in disbelief as her mother walked to her and put her arms around her, you still fear their loss, it seems.”

Anlessa broke her mother’s embrace and sat on her bed in shock, and neither should the rest of her family.  “They returned?  But father never made it – Arl Howe…”

Eleanor sat gently next to her daughter

“But the Blight

Eleanor shook her head and sighed, which retreated immediately back underground.  It was no more than a surface raid, from what your father reported.”

As her mother spoke, waking in the Wilds to discover a witch she had once thought was no more than a myth had saved her from certain demise.  The more she concentrated, the easier it was to remember, and to recognize where her true reality lay.  Looking at her mother sternly, she rose and pronounced, “It is a lie.  I am a Grey Warden, I survived Ostagar, and I have a duty that lies before me.”

Eleanor stood in anger and grasped her daughter by the shoulders, to Highever, and to your family.  Your duty is to serve your father and I, and to marry and continue the Cousland family line.  You must stop with this childish game of make-believe in which you aim to be savior of the world, Anlessa!”

Anlessa’s lip jutted forward in defiance as she struggled to hold her emotions in check.  “My duty is to protect this country from the Blight

The woman before her deflated, “My child, you were always so strong willed.  There’s no telling you anything when you have your mind set on your goals.”

Anlessa smiled, she replied, “I learned that from you, Mother.  I can’t thank you enough for all that you’ve taught me.”

Dark circles developed slowly under the Teyrna’s eyes.  “You won’t stay?  Fergus will be here shortly.  I know your father would want to see you

Tears stung at the back of Anlessa’s eyes, here – no matter how desperately I may want to.”

Eleanor leaned down, my daughter.  Take the blessings of your family with you.”  She looked down at the young woman and brushed wisps of raven-black hair from the girl’s face.  “My beautiful girl.  I am so proud of you.”

Anlessa was then completely alone, Anlessa wept.",,False,self,t5_2r8lo,False,,

1341954401.0,wcjr3,Dragon Age Pen and Paper. (Story Inside),AlludingIllusion,18,0,5,"So I've been GMing the pen and paper version of Dragon Age. For anyone that has never tried a pen and paper game

*Setup: I GM a group of 4 adventurers. A human apostate (Jericho), and elf rogue (Achima).  They are quite an obnoxious bunch and had been causing a lot of trouble for people.*

*Key Facts: Only Rylin wears steel armor; the rest wear leather or none.*

I had the group meet a female elf seeking safe passage and they offered to take her through part of the Bannorn to get to her home.  The group traveled on with her and eventually nighttime game and so they made camp in an abandoned tower.

The elf offered everyone in the group some wine and jerky. Elora and Jericho both drank some of the wine without reservations.  Achima and Rylin declined.  Immediately after

After some time the elf came up to Achima who then failed both a perception and dex test to see a hidden blade and to dodge it.  The elf stabbed Achima with a poison blade who then immediately went limp and fell to the group paralyzed but awake.  

Rylin heard the noise and stood up yelling.  Both Elora and Jericho woke up but were also paralyzed and failed constitution tests on the poison.  Only Rylin stood between this elf and her killing the entire group.

The elf threw a hidden vile of a green substance as Rylin charged her.  It hit him directly in the chest and the vile burst on his armor.  It was at this point that the liquid starting burning through his armor and some of it managed to fall onto Achima

Rylin ""stunted"" or ""critted"" the elf and lopped her in half.  He immediately ripped all the clothes and armor off Achima to prevent any damage to her.  He then searched the dead elf women but rolled horribly.  He found a file of white swirling liquid and a vile of green liquid

Rylin thought that one of them was the antidote so he poured some of both of them on the ground.  Each of the substances fizzed and bubbled on the dirt.  Rylin

Rylin panicked because Jericho started vomiting blood.  Rylin proceeded to try and force some of the green liquid down the throat of the vomiting Jericho.  This failed miserably as Jericho just vomited it back onto Rylin's armor which started to burn and melt like earlier.

Rylin proceeded to take off his arm and run around the room in a panic.  He then re-searched the dead elf's lower half where he rolled well enough to notice a compartment on the elf's boots.  Instead of searching for a means to open the compartment he bashed it in with his sword and a loud crack was heard. 

Immediately after bashing it in with his sword

Here's where it gets ridiculous: Rylin decided the only way he could save Jericho was to get this purple liquid (which was the antidote) into Jericho by any means possible.  Rylin took off his gauntlets and  rubbed the purple liquid all over his hands, Rylin rolled so high on both attack and damage that he rendered Jericho unconscious.

The day ended up being saved but at the Jericho's cost.  Many jokes were made after that point and a new ""bromance"" was formed.

I could not stop laughing throughout this entire encounter. It was not how I saw the situation going at all. But yeah

**TLDR: Group gets poisoned.  Mage is vomiting and on verge of death. Warrior decides best way to administer antidote is to cover his hand in the antidote and ANALY FIST the Mage

Yet in most fights in DA:O, my dog and a Rogue as my PC, all of them around lvl 8. I just had to drop the difficulty to ""Easy"" because I really wasn't in the mood to slough out the fight against that elven assassin; Alistair had barely connected with the first few enemies and he was half dead already. Or that fight in Redcliffe before you enter the castle; the Revenant took my half a dozen tries and even on the successful attempt, I blew through at least a dozen healing poultices.

**[1) Aveline](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Aveline) Human Warrior (f)**

Aveline Vallen is a soldier, Aveline is not the knight her father wished her to be. Although fully trained in chivalrous combat, she was raised in the shadow of a lost life and will not lose another for the sake of honor. Protecting her adopted home of Kirkwall becomes a chosen duty, not a privileged calling. The people she stands for will not be wasted on lost causes or protecting the foolish from themselves. Pride can be bandaged like any other wound—when threats are dead and everyone is safely home.

**[2) Fenris](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Fenris) Elf Warrior (m)**

Once slave to a Tevinter magister, and eventually used his power to escape his chains. Now he finds himself in a strange land with no friends—and a former master that refuses to let him be.

**[3) Isabella](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Isabela)  Human Rogue (f)**

Isabela is the pirate scourge of two coastlines, and it's hard to know which cuts deeper. It's rare to see her in one place for long, but with her ship reduced to timbers, Isabela's had to content herself with whatever bounty Kirkwall has to offer. And that means no end of headaches for the rich and foolish, and no end of amusement for her. She's as desired as she is feared, which is to say, a lot and often. Fall on her blade, in her book. Shipwrecked

Also

**[4) Merrill](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Merrill) Elf Mage (f)**

Merrill is the apprentice of the clan's Keeper

She was also involved in the Daelish Elf origin in Dragon Age: Origins.

**[5) Varric](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Varric) Dwarf Rogue (m)**

Words are his trade, and has never worked the Stone. He prefers a warm tavern fire, a mug that never empties, a willing audience, and an unwilling subject. He can spin a grand story of Ancestors and Paragons—or anything you like—but it’s not out of reverence. Truth is just another commodity. History is written by the victors, but it can also be written by Varric, who then decides the victors. If you want profit, Bartrand

Varric also serves as the game narrator.  (I already like this guy)

**[6)  Anders](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Anders) [{Featuring Justice?}](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Justice)  Human Mage (m)

Anders, has changed. Urged by his friend Justice to fight the Circle of Magi more actively, Anders agreed to become Justice's human host… only to find that his anger at the Circle warped Justice into the demonic spirit of Vengeance. Now Anders must struggle mentally and physically to maintain his control over the demon within... at least long enough to see the Circle of Magi overturned forever.

Despite the various epilogues of Awakening

Justice at some point urged his friend Anders to fight the Circle of Magi more actively


**[7) Sebastian Vael](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Sebastian_Vael) Human Rogue (m)**

Sworn to the priesthood as a boy

Sebastian is a downloadable content character.

The other is a bit of a odd theory. The short version Flemeth is Andraste. There's not a lot of substantial evidence but a lot of coincidental/anecdotal evidence. First is there is some hints in DA:O that Andraste is a mage (the book you can give Wynne along with some dialog). Using her magic we know she can create more then one of herself and she can abandon her body and poses a new one allowing the urn of sacred ashes to exist. We also know that a fragment of the original guardians believe the dragon is Andraste reborn and that dragon is the same type of dragon that Flemeth can change into. The dalish have a unique title for her and have respect for her although she is a human (or at least looks like one most of the time) so it is possible that they remember to respect/fear her but not know she is Andraste because of lost records and stories. Lastly we know stories have been changed and fabricated and even though they are old dose not mean they are true given Morigan's claim that the stories about he mother are mostly false.

In that order.
So, can I have the foursome at the Pearl even if I have already dumped Leliana when I go there, is the hardening and approval the only criteria for her to accept?

I really love taking up a role as a specific character inbetween other like-minded individuals. I would suggest written roleplay through either a forum or something similar. 

Story, Location .. Everything will be decided on a later date but I would love to hear ideas.

It'd require somewhat maturity to be able to work as it takes a lot of effort to actually become succesful and fun for **everyone**. I'll slowly start this group and if you're interested contact me through a PM with ideas or just a wish to joining something that will hopefully end in a lot of fun.

First off, given that I'm so familiar with the Final Fantasy universe, but the Codex makes it easy to check to cure my confusion. The characters certainly are a draw and I appreciate the focus on character development. The casual commentary as I run around is fantastic. Alistair in particular is probably my favorite at this point. 

I do like the mmo style battle system. As I referenced on the other thread, but that may be due to the fact that I'm not as familiar with the Tactics system at this point. (Admittedly, I'm playing on Casual mode simply so I can enjoy the story, so take that into consideration)

I'm not a fan of the excessive blood splatter, but because it's more akin to a Japanese splatter film. It seems a little ridiculous to cut a wolf once, and suddenly my entire party has blood everywhere. It does add some comical value in the heart felt scenes after a battle. I look deeply into Liliana's eyes, as she speaks with blood draped across her mouth. I guess she got her red wings, eh? :P

Another lighter grievance is when I'm purchasing gear, so that could be little more than newbie bitching on my part.

&gt; Zevran: So

&gt; Loghain: I am no longer a teyrn

&gt; Zevran: So just Loghain

&gt; Loghain: Correct. What's on your mind? 

&gt; Zevran: You know who I am

&gt; Loghain: I thought you looked familiar. 

&gt; Zevran: Well

&gt; Loghain: You don't say. 

&gt; Zevran: I'm terribly broken up over it. 

&gt; Loghain: Hmm. Well thank you kindly for informing me.

Loghain: Gracious as you please. Drier than dust.


And for DA2

&gt; Anders: You were an idiot to leave Hawke. 

&gt; Fenris: And you were fast enough to replace me. 

&gt; Anders: I love her. You can't even imagine what that is. 

&gt; Fenris: Do not bare your heart to me

""As the Chantry’s oppression of the mages comes to a head in the opening of Inquisition, “and that kicks off the events."" Following that, nations plunge into war, and “the decision is made to bring back an inquisition to find out what’s going on and stop this,” 

The ""Nations"" part intrigues me obviously it is most likely going to be set in Orlais but I have seen some people say that from the trailer it looks like the Anderfels as well and obviously we also see the Qunari in the trailer also. Now if the Qunari are in it is there then a possibility of involvement from Tevinter?

1319375033.0,llzg3,My theory about the qunari,LiudvikasT,16,5,12,"I'm currently playing Dragon Age 2 and no matter what you say about the game

And my hypothesis is this: they are aliens who crash-landed on the planet
Why do I think so? Let me tell:

1. They appeared rather recently - four centuries ago. Before that no one has any information about them. It's hard to imagine someone like them could hide for long. So the best guess is that they did not live on the planet before that
2. While the whole world is very familiar with magic, that is responsible for magic abilities of some humans. While it's abundant on this planet, it was probably non-existent on their homeworld. When they arrived the contact with the mineral caused some individuals to develop abilities unknown to the qunari. Possibly creating a lot of abominations in the process. And so the qunari deemed magic to be extremely dangerous, even more so than the other races.
3. They appear to be more technologically advanced than other races. They have access to gunpowder, navy and so on. While it's not exactly space age technology we must consider that without the worldwide industry to support them, that is about the best a technologically advanced race could do.
4. Lower population. As little as 4 centuries had hard time to increase their population to a size the other races enjoy.


So I assume this is what happened:

At least 4-5 centuries ago a qunari spaceship crashed and they were stranded, never to return. And the purpose is clear of course, to push forward technology and industry of the local population so some future descendants could return home. It was obvious that this task would take more than a single generation and with their technology and any evidence gone any future generations would have hard time believing their origins, it would at best turn into myths if not disappear completely. So he created a religion - The Qun. Any society that could send them into space soon, needed to be unquestioning and with single goal. Religion is an obvious choice to achieve it.
So time passed and they began their war to unite the world, which were a match even to their great technological advantage. With time passing their origins were forgotten as it was predicted and now even with core principles of their mission intact no one knows their true purpose even though they still strive to achieve it. A master plan indeed.",,False,self,t5_2r8lo,False,,

In the end, Duelist, Shadow, and maybe legionnaire scout (I can't remember how many specialization points you get), all of which gave me great active and passive abilities.

I had looked through old posts here in search of mods and will want to know of more that you enjoy and I want to ask questions about some. 

Of course the first item up for business was to get everyone naked. Done and done. Also got a real skin mod that makes people look more real and then got a sexy Wynne mod that makes Wynne a sexier older lady. 

Anyways

I also have an issue with a More Hair mod that has all these new hairstyles showing up invisible and I have 30 or so bright white hair colors. 

As for controls, you just had to look in the general direction, the item or enemy name you wanted to interact with had to have a health bar or name pop up and all you had to do was press the action button. Much less time consuming than having to position my cursor over the object. I know it's probably something I have to get used to and will come to be comfortable with. I guess my problems more with the mouse than the keyboard. I'm fine with the movement, I just can't get used to lining up perfectly Everytime to issue an action. 

My second issue I hold with contempt

Yes I have seen the mod for the auto loot. I have also heard it has issues but that was in a 900 day old post. Are these issues worked out? How easy is auto-loot to use? Is there a console command that loots the area you are in? 

Character Respec. I have seen this but I was curious how it works. Does it allow you to redistribute attribute and talent points? Is there a console command that does this for you?

Qunari is a bit like ""Elven"". When you ask the Dalish guarding their camp who they are

Likewise, just like we have atheist Jews here on planet Earth. Simple as that. As for Qunari from other species, we can specify that if we want to avoid confusion. Qunari elf, Qunari human. When we say ""Qunari"" in general, it is a safe bet to think that we're talking about their species. And we can always tell one meaning from the other from the context. For example, [here is Sten comparing the strength of human teeth and Qunari teeth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UB8Og8ZzuA#t=24m50s). That shows the term Qunari is also used to refer to them, not only to their beliefs.

What is ""Kossith"" then? Honestly, nor do the denizens of Ferelden and the Free Marches (who call them Qunari). Knowledgeable people, is it from one of the books or guides?

**Side Quests and Secondary Quests**

There are about a gajillion ""side quests"", but what about secondary quests?  I kind of want to make sure all the companions are recruited and their stories fleshed out, and to complete the main story as thoroughly as possible. I don't want to get bogged down in too many fetch/kill errands if the only payoff will be loot or XP. But having been burned a few times in Mass Effect by either not getting to a quest on time or ignoring a seemingly minor request (Wrex's family armor...), I don't want to have that experience ever again.

**Conversation Wheel Options**

It appears that Hawke's responses are similar to Mass Effect's Paragon-Neutral-Renegade options, but with NPCs I would really like to role-play more naturally, responding as appropriate to victims and villains. But would this affects Hawke's main story arc, or makes a particular ending difficult to achieve?

I think that I just need to spend more time getting used to the characters and their moves and(spells and such).

**Out of the Box: Collector's Edition**

For an extra $10 I'm surprised that anyone is buying the standard edition; the collector's edition delivers for me. The packaging is quite attractive. 

For the PS3 it still sports the old PlayStation logo - a bit odd considering the brand revamp happened almost two months ago. The slip case is attractive, two discs, and two pieces of paper for the included bonus content.

I was very impressed with the manual; it doesn't compare to Baldur's Gate I or II (I still have those on my bookshelf and leaf through them from time to time. Volo and Elminster crack me up) but it's got a sufficient quantity of information to get you started. The cloth map is an ever so *slight* disappointment: it's shedding threads on my coffee table as we speak. I was hoping the edges would be finished; I'm going to have to either frame this or fold it up and not handle it or it'll be gone before you know it.

The DLC on PS3 is a chore. Downloading each piece of content boots you out of the game into the PlayStation Store Lite Edition that will only let you download that piece of content. You have to go through the process of downloading the item, Dragon Age Journeys, and the Character Creator. Checking under Dragon Age in the PS Store yields no available content - something that would have made it easy to download the items you have rights too. I suppose they have to verify your EA account, but it's still restrictive and a right pain in the ass. It felt like the game was trying my patience when I was getting set up.

I did buy the optional content for $7. We usually pay more for these items in Canada


**Gameplay So Far**

I can't really do much here other than chime in with everyone else: it's great. Like really, Borderlands). It delivers the goods.



**Video Performance**

It's true that the frame rate becomes janky at times. You just feel like you're moving a little slowly. That said

It has to be said that the colours and the textures are fantastic. I went with the PS3 version after reading several reviews that said the Xbox version felt washed out and the low res textures on it were bothering reviewers. I can't speak to the Xbox version, ominous greens and blues. In short: Dragon Age: Origins does away with the next gen filter and gives the colour gamut of your HDTV a workout.

There are some glitches and tearing


**Audio**

If you're looking for immersive audio, and the 5.1 surround is always active. I chose a bit of a smarmy character voice (I'm rolling a bard first time around) so I'm hearing things like ""Because we're that AWESOME!"" or something similar - it's a bit odd but I'm going with it. 

I had to turn the sound down later in the evening for fear of irritating my neighbors. Let's just say that the bass is very


**Social Networking and Enhanced Content**

DA:O did something quite different when it has come to marketing. Setting up a sub-reddit on reddit was a smart, to a degree, for what happens there).
