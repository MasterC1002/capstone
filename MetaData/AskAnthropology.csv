So can anyone who is more familiar with Diamond than I explain in a more in-depth way just why we dislike him so much?

1371096075.0,1g8w1a,"Has socio-cultural anthropology jumped the shark? Is it mostly just ""applied critical theory""? And if so, is this a good thing? If not, what does it do that's not merely descriptive ""area studies""? What are even the big empirically driven debates?",yodatsracist,18,11, excepting a few luminaries (Erving Goffman, Paul F. Lazarsfeld

During the 80's, if you're actually interested in socio-cultural anthropology and haven't read the article, please do).  Statistics probably had something else to do with it, as it made it harder for people to generalize based on single cases.  Today, socio-cultural anthropology seems to be content with either navel-gazing reflections on critical theory or remaining largely descriptive (often hoping for advocacy or just featuring beautiful pictures). One of the things is, because the very act of knowing is questioned, there are no big debates--you don't see the classic Marvin Harris vs. Marshall Sahlins debate that you used to.  Granted, but it's hard for me to point to a single major debate within socio-cultural anthropology--and the ones I'm vaguely aware of seem to be more psycho-philosophical (""What is the self?"") than empirical.  Shortly before he died

Similarly, said in his pamphlet *[Waiting for Foucault, Still](http://www.ugr.es/~aalvarez/observadorcultural/Documentos/Sahlins_2002.pdf)* (pdf) (I'm commenting particularly on the sections  ""Poetics of Culture, III"" [pg. 20-23] and ""Borrrrrring"" [pg. 73-74], but the whole thing is good).

&gt;‚ÄúA hyper-inflation of significance‚Äù would be another way of describing the new functionalism, a veritable La Ruse of postmodernism. Of course the effect, rather than amplifying the significance of [the empirical examples I discussed], is to trivialize such terms as ‚Äúdomination,‚Äù ‚Äúresistance,‚Äù ‚Äúcolonization,‚Äù even ‚Äúviolence‚Äù and ‚Äúpower.‚Äù Deprived of real-political reference, full of sound and fury and signifying nothing...but the speaker.

As someone who works on the Middle East, both ""activisty"" (""applied anthropology"") and another that's philosophical without getting into power (this type thinks a lot about the ""self"") (I'm bracketing Medical Anthropology here because I think there's actually a lot of cool, interesting work in the field).

There are many things I'm curious about: what happened to empiricism in socio-cultural anthropology?  If you remove critical theory and other bits of popular philosophy, has socio-cultural anthropology jumped the shark--is there nothing to it besides a jumble of neo-Marxist philosophy + area studies?

I have long thought  that faith has a genetic component. It has arisen independently in almost every culture and I see good anthropological reasons for faith to be an advantage in regard to group bonding, etc. Many primitive religions are combined with astronomy so planting times and harvest times could be determined. 



Here is where my question gets sticky. Speaking to avid several sports fans I have on several independent occasions heard them compare their own feelings of faith to their love of sports. These are simply anecdotal events. There is some archeological evidence to suggest some connection with faith and sports in the past



 When I discuss faith here I do not mean the Biblical definition, upbringing, psychology, group pressure and other factors not related to genetics play a major role in whether one acquires a faith.  



I know anthropology tends to paint genetics with rather wide brush strokes . Are there any studies that correlate faith with appreciation of sports? Or perhaps genes that have a positive correlation to faith?  If it has not yet been done it seems a simple enough study to do: Find the painted people who are screaming at a sporting event and ask ""What is your faith if any?"" :) Religious affiliation is not exactly what I am looking for but the data might prove interesting. I understand that a correlation does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship but it might serve as a basis for further study.",,t5_2wl4u,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/1jg8mi/faith_genetics_and_sports/

1) humanity's development and advancement of technology  
2) the changes that technological advancement has had on humanity's development itself over time

I have to explain myself or a second for this question to make real sense: 

Until the neolithic revolution, for example. And that environment in which that occurred and that evolutionary advancement was not impacted in any meaningful or unnatural way by people's activities or lifestyles--or technology. It just happened as a natural result of ""hominids"" (I'm not sure of the name) coping and adapting to their environment.

However, communicate with one another, share ideas and over the millennia develop awesome technology that humans used to further mold the world around them.

Fast forward big time, refrigerators, electricity, laptops and the Internet. All of these things affect most of us in very direct ways, and they've certainly changed the way in which people affected the earth, coped with diseases, approached the task of eating food

So

Because

In other words

Let me be more specific

There are a few biological evolutionary traits/things that have occurred since the Neolithic Revolution: tolerance to dairy products and humans' failing eyesight, so it has diminished over time. I imagine even more wild biological changes in the coming millennia as humans have become couch potatoes. 

Anyway, we have come (or we already did come) to a point in which our evolutionary development is no longer natural--or evolution as described by Darwin--but rather a product of human technology. 

Does this sit well with anyone else? That we control--or strongly impact--our biological evolution over time and that

1. How do you feel that the mass censorship of media affects the well-being of a society?

2. Do you feel that there are any historical examples in which mass censorship has benefited a society greatly?

3. Can censorship ever achieve its intended purpose of protecting a society or will it always do more harm than good?

4. Is there a specific type of government that you feel can use censorship most effectively to benefit their people?

5. The Vietnam war was one of the most documented and least censored wars in recent history

Most human states have, so I take this (perhaps wrongly?) to be something inherent in human social interaction.  The obvious reasons that present themselves are either that such consolidation is fundamentally more stable then alternative systems, or that lust for power builds monarchist systems globally.  How far off am I?
