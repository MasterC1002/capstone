This is -my- method for implementing modes effectively in modern compositions. It also helps for understanding progressions in popular music that people often ask about here at r/musictheory. This isn't the only way to think about it

**Comprehensive Modal Palette**

* C - I, IV, V, vi, vii^o - Ionian, Major Mode
* D - i, IV, v, vi^o, (b)VII - Dorian, Minor Mode
* E - i, iv, v^o, VI, vii - Phrygian, Minor Mode
* F - I, iv^o, V, vi, vii - Lydian, Major Mode
* G - I, IV, v, vi, (b)VII - Mixolydian, Major Mode
* A - i, iv, v, VI, (b)VII - Aeolian, Minor Mode
* B - i^o, iv, V, VI, vii - Locrian, Minor Mode, hardly used. 
* Dim - i, biv, bV, v^o, vi, bvii^o - Chords of the Diminished Scale, alternative to Locrian mode

**Compelling Sonorities of Modes**

Quick reference chart for chords that more often ""strongly imply"" specific modes:
(Note, and dominant differ from one mode to the next. Sorry, u/spiderofdestiny, I should have been more clear about this. Thank you for your comment.)

* I, Ionian (""vanilla"") mode
* i
* i
* I, V - implies Lydian, weaker implication here without #11 resolution in melody
* I
* i

**The Theory Behind Using Modes**

To get the most use out of modes, this is not the case with modal writing. Instead, we're going to go back to Riemann and how functional harmony began as a concept.

In Riemann's view, and its dominant. If you stacked all three of these chords on top of each other, you'd hear every note of the key. For example, in C Major, you have CEG, FAC, and GBD. Line those up and you have CDEFGABC... the whole scale. 

Sonorities other than the tonic, subdominant, or dominant. For example, a 'ii' chord in this key would be considered a subdominant chord over the root of the second scale degree, not a separate, independent sonority as it is labeled in common practice. The vii^o chord would be considered a ""weakened"" dominant, since we've removed the root of the chord. The 'vi' chord would be considered a ""submediant"" tonic since its root is below the root of tonic

**Versatility**

What we need to realize here is that the underlying theory behind ""functionality"" is actually much more liberating when we take away the rest of the common practice formula. Even during the common practice

When you take, you allow yourself several options. It could be a minor 'ii', you could alter the third and borrow it from the Lydian mode to make a 'II', or if you're using a minor mode like Aeolean, you could lower the root and turn it into a bII. 

There are still limitations. One limitation of the second scale degree, which even in the diminished scale doesn't present itself anywhere. This breaches the diatonic language of tertian harmony (building sonorities on thirds) and takes us into harmonies like Augmented Chords and so forth you learn about after your first semester/year of theory. The bii chord, in this case, would more likely be used to ""pivot"" to a different key than to evoke a mode. 

Regardless, experiment with a chord from a different key, and want to understand how you did it so you can compose with more theoretical ""intent"" or understanding - so that this aesthetic can be replicated in other music you write. 

**Putting it to Use**

I'm just scratching the surface here. There's a great deal more that plays into this on a linear (melodic) level, 11ths, and 13ths) really begin to come into focus. I just want to end this with a very basic example of how to ""evoke"" a mode in a key with informed purpose and intent, to mean that we haven't only borrowed a chord from another mode because we like it - we know where the chord comes from AND we know how it influences the mode of the key center we are currently using. 

The very basic structure we need to understand are the tonic

* I
* i

We are in some Minor key. One would expect a 'iv' subdominant, when we borrow the 'IV' in a minor key, we are specifically borrowing the syntax to create a Dorian sound for our key. 

And really, and this time, let's borrow a bVII. What mode has both a 'I' and a 'bVII'? Mixolydian. This is the ONLY mode that contains both. When we borrow multiple times, we can do so from any mode. For example, we can borrow the bVI from minor when we are in a Major key. What Major mode has a bVI and a I? None of them do. This is when we can say what we borrowed has created a ""mixed"" mode. Modes that ""mix"" well are those that trade their compelling sonorities. 

You can see in the ""compelling sonorities"" chart I made above that I refer to Ionian and Aeolean as ""vanilla"". All this means is that our ears are most accustomed to these modes culturally. There's nothing necessarily ""inherent"" in these modes that makes them this way, you could use Strawberry, or maybe you like it in the Banana Split fashion - Banana, Chocolate Syrup, maybe some nuts. 

When we mix modes, but you'll also need to play around with these sonorities to find what best nurtures your aesthetic and interest in music. 

I hope this gives you a better understanding of where these ""borrowed"" chords and contemporary tonal harmony in general both come from. I've spent a lot of time trying to come up with ways of understanding and explaining it. I doubt it's perfect

**tl;dr** - Tried to share my approach to contemporary tonal harmony using modes

**Edit**: Hey all! Thanks for all the up-votes!! Definitely plan to do another one of these in the next week or so. I hope it's okay with u/big_star

&gt;I didn't see this mentioned, if you want to create functional progressions. 

While this is technically true, the IV chord is the ""tendency"" chord, primarily because the subdominant is minor in our ""vanilla"" Aeolean mode. A simple, Dorian progression could be i - IV, as opposed to the i - iv we would expect to hear from using the Aeolean mode exclusively.

I'm also finding that using these tendency sonorities makes V7-I/i relationships even more compelling, give it a Dorian flavor, then modulate to a new key/mode using V7 of the key I'm attempting to modulate to - heck, I could add a minor 7th to the IV chord to modulate to the bVII, making it the new key center. 

I just wanted to explain the difference I see in using the V7 sonority to tonicize a ""pitch-center"" compared to using a ""tendency sonority"" to evoke or imply a mode. There's a subtle but important difference,,False,,t5_2qrjj,1376230693.0,,True

1351940177.0,12k6ep,The truth about perfect pitch.,PitchyPitch,224,51,139,"(Disclaimer: yes, my passion

Inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/12j97f/can_absolute_pitch_be_learned/) recent /r/musictheory post, I feel strongly moved to provide some insight into what perfect pitch really is, what it does, how it works, and the truths about its pros and cons.  There seem to be some genuine misconceptions.

Now

And yes, it's been with us our whole lives, it brings us joy (and sometimes misery, as I'll mention later), it seems to make us special.  I am not describing the joy of clutching a treasure or a trophy.  Rather, it's simply something that's been with us for decades, something we've been using nearly nonstop all these years.  Imagine if you got your first [IBM M keyboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard) when you were 6, and the entire time

So when people diminish perfect pitch, I just wish my friend were understood a little bit better. 

So

**No

Calling perfect pitch a ""party trick"" betrays a misunderstanding of how perfect pitch is applied.  It isn't like a gadget that is employed to identify pitches on an ear-training test.  Rather

A close analogy would be your eyes.  When you look out your window, a few cars, and a hobo.  In that moment when you look out the window, you receive an instantaneous understanding of what is out there.  **At no point do you have to examine each individual element** -- ""those round black shapes on the bottom, the clear bits on the sides ... this must be a car!""  No, the entire picture has been presented to you with perfect clarity and detail, in a flash.

Or perhaps consider what it's like when someone is talking to you.  Your friend says to you, you parse the entire sentence in one ear-gulp with full meaning, **reflexively and involuntarily**.  You can't NOT understand what your friend has told you, as much as you might want to.  You have the information whether you asked for it or not.  Now that it's there, you can set your conscious mind to the task of figuring out how you're going to clean your cat.

So imagine what happens when someone with PP listens to a song.  Without consciously using her brain, 100% complete state.  Song.7z.  What she decides to do with that package of data is up to her.  But the way she apprehended the music is fundamentally different than if she did not have PP.

When you have perfect pitch

The main effect here is simply one of increased efficiency.  To a musician with perfect pitch, and while it's outside the scope of this blather, it's worth noting that kids with perfect pitch should almost certainly be taught ear training separately from other students.  Talk about starting a war!  Trust me, I know it sounds shitty and obnoxious.  But the fact is, to a kid with perfect pitch, conventional ear-training can be extremely confusing and misleading.  I'll let someone else bring it up another time.)

The long-term effects are the meaningful ones

**When you have perfect pitch, immerses you with notes whether you like it or not.**

This ain't always so hot.  If you are stuck in a car with a friend who insists on listening to Fall Out Boy or The Decembrists (that's right, the experience can be pretty painful.  Sure, **transposing with perfect pitch is maddening and stressful**, but that pales in comparison with the other tortures you can inflict on someone with PP.

This is why you'll often hear that folks with PP prefer silence.  Not always.  But often.

But the upside to having an always-on music computer cannot be overestimated.  And it's not the ease of transcription, intimate connection with music that is not possible otherwise.**

The notes themselves are like friends

**We remember every G# with emotional context.  Every B has a thousand subconscious stories.** 

Every single note is remembered

So the point isn't that people with perfect pitch are full of shit.  The real point is that **the relationship they develop with the notes is real**.  That they are able to genuinely feel this closeness, obviously notes don't have colors, but they do all have memories, associations, and deep, deep feelings.

I wish I could explain these things better!  I apologize if I haven't offered any real insight.  I'm an oldfart!  In any case I'm at the text limit. So

**PP doesn't magically turn you into a genius, shitty musicians.  And I know many musicians without PP who are astonishing.

**PP will, more personal, and more fun.   Perhaps more relevant, if your parents find out that you have perfect pitch, they are more likely to support your musical education.  All of this is a major predictor for a life or career in music.  

**Don't bother trying to ""learn"" perfect pitch if you don't already have it.**  Maybe it's possible, your time is better spent simply listening to as much music as you can, and forging your own relationship with music.  Try to make it as intimate and special as you can.  That is where the happiness is!  :)

Thanks for reading.

PS: For those interested to know

At first I thought that I must have done too much drinking and drugging.  Then I began to suspect that maybe I had some degenerative brain disease.  Finally, perfect pitch -- like once-close friends, just drifts away.  And at the moment, I can't justifiably consider what I possess to be ""perfect pitch"" anymore.

This method of harmonizing a melody is seen VERY frequently in the music of Debussy and many other composers during the Impressionist era to today. This gives a very ethereal, and it is one of my favorite colors to add when appropriate. 

To harmonize with all major chords, and Quintan positions:

Octave position: melody note (soprano) is the same as the root of the chord. So if ""C"" is my first melody note, etc.

Tertian: melody note is the third of the chord. To find the root take given melody note ""E"", use D as the root of the chord (D major). 

Quintan: melody note is the fifth of the chord. To find the root, use D as the root of the chord (D major). 


Now that you know what the positions are

Example. Take a simple ascending melody: C,G,A (rhythm variable).
                  
 -simply alternate between oct

Octave C (C major), Tertian G (Eb major), Octave A (A major)


It was characteristic of Impressionist composers to start and end a phrase with Octave (starting with Tertian is also fairly common

You can also add passing tones and other none chord tones pretty effectively to spread out the harmony. However

I have a problem: I love music theory and I love pop music.  My two loves

Classical music theory tells me that pop music is cheap and simple.  Pop songs are so simple and recycle so much harmonic content!  There are only a couple of chords that repeat over and over again.  Compared to the chromatic masterpieces of Schumann ([Dichterliebe, Strauss ([Salome, Finale](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agx27K5iZ0Q)), and many others during the 19th century, these songs are really simple!  Modern songs are plain even in a textural sense--most pop songs are solo + accompaniment and rarely do you hear anything that can compare with Bach ([Art of Fugue, Contrapunctus 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwkzf-KUNPM)) or Byrd's ([Mass for Four Voices, Kyrie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yT0kLA6DHA)) polyphonic magic.  By these standards

Pop music tells me a different story

Clearly

Music theory should be a way for us to think analytically about the music we hear and should ultimately seek to find the best ways to describe music so that general principles can be discovered.  Classic music theory based on Roman Numerals simply was not built to understand modern music.  We need a new system with which to understand modern popular music.  I'm not saying that we should simply throw out everything we've learned about tonal music but I think that attempting to analyze popular music with classical theory is like trying to weigh yourself with a ruler--you're using the wrong tool.

I'd like to start a discussion on how we can build a new theoretical system that can be used to understand the intricacies of modern popular music.  Among many things

* Categorize and analyze chord progressions: While it is convenient to notate chord progressions with Roman Numerals, the music manages our expectations by expanding the cadential motif of the tonic, subdominant, and dominant.  Popular music seems to manage our expectations in a different way.  Each unique chord progression is its own motif and a song works precisely because this progression of chords is repeated--the listener's expectations are based on this chord progression rather than the tonic-dominant relation of classical music.  When we use Roman Numerals, we give each chord a function and implicitly this gives the chord a meaning that it may not have in popular music.  A new way to analyze/notate chord progressions could perhaps focus more on root motion and less on identifying a tonal center.

* Categorize and analyze drum/bass rhythm: a lot of modern popular music have very intricate drum/bass rhythm combinations.  They're complex but I believe that through looking

* Find a way to deal with the break down of pitch: increasingly we are seeing that the traditional idea of a pitch is losing ground.  In more and more music, and all sorts of previously impossible aural sensations that are clearly not noise but are also not quite pitches.  To really analyze popular music, these sounds need a place in the system.

I don't really have a clue as to where to go with this which is why I'm posting this on Reddit!  If I had to guess

1375151878.0,1jbm2x,A Comprehensive Guide to Creating and/or Understanding Chord Progressions Using Tonal Harmony,Salemosophy,86,9,19,"**What you should already know:**

* A basic understanding of how we build chords (a root
* The four generic types of chords (Major, and Diminished)
* The existence of ""harmonic function"" in the chords I
* Your modes

**What you're going to learn from this Guide:**

* The basic anatomy of a chord progression
* The chords we can use (anything goes)
* How to borrow from other scales/modes to enhance your progression

**The Anatomy of a Chord Progression**

At the core of our most common chord progressions is the existence of three functional components - a tonal center, subdominant, and dominant first. It can become confusing, however, when we begin learning these functions through cadential examples that could be hundreds of years old. 

Also, as though there's a prescription to which we must adhere in our chord selection process. This is behind us by at least a century or more. Romanticism and Modernism have done well to break us of our dogged reliance upon any prescripts to the sonorities we use and when. 

The bottom line in TODAY'S music is that the rules have changed. Really, good to understand for a historical perspective on how music has advanced. But whenever this question of chord progressions comes up, it's either because some DIYer or undergrad music major has somehow arrived at an impasse in their reasoning around harmonic function. There's either a sense that using a particular chord in a particular way is ""wrong"" or there's a sense of unstructured chaos in this that I find particularly unproductive.

So, subdominant, and dominant functionality still appears to exist. It simply exists ""modularly"", in contrast to ""progressively"". 

Progressions of chords today don't always ""progressively"" move from I to IV to V to I. One example of this is the popular song progression - |I|V|vi|IV| which basically takes the primary functional form of |I|V|I|IV| - and there's good reason for why this progression is so popular. Actually

Suppose I want to write my song in Minor instead of Major. I might use the variant of the popular song progression in Major for my tune for its versatility - |i|VI|III|bVII| Now

The answer is... No! We haven't. In fact

* In C Major: ||I|V|vi|IV|| = ||CEG|GBD|ACE|FAC||
* In A Minor: ||i|VI|III|bVII|| = ||ACE|FAC|CEG|GBD||

This isn't a happy coincidence. It occurs because of the prominence of all pitches among the three structural chords of tonal music - I, these chords will complete a scale if extracted from their chordal structure and lined up consecutively. From CEG, FAC, and GBD, we can extract all pitches and line them up to make the C Major Scale - CDEFGABC. If such an ""anatomy"" of chord progressions exists, I, IV, in the case of the popular song progression

**The Chords We Can Use: Anything Goes**

So far, V, and this 'vi' chord. And of course, it's all represented in roman numerals so we're still in highly ""theoretical"" territory, right? Maybe we were introduced to these in our theory curriculum, possibly even in this exact order. It makes sense to assume this, as most cadential figures in our tradition use these chords in highly prescribed ways. We have the plagal cadence, authentic cadence of V-I. We have the deceptive cadence of V-vi. But do we really understand how this transformed into the current conventional uses of these sonorities today? 

Truthfully, the discussion of contemporary tonal practices began to take a dive. But picking up where Romanticism and maybe Post-Minimalism left off, we can see a trend emerging in the past 60 years of popular music where the treatment of I, IV, and V remains largely intact... but with a twist. **EDIT:** The twist is that today, this approach to progressions allows us to work with ""modularity."" We don't necessarily have to think ahead about preparing our next ""key"" center. We can write a progression and plug it in where we want it to fit into our music simply by understanding the way I, IV

A few hundred years ago, is equally distant from its Subdominant chord below it and its Dominant above it. Basically, all harmony in music boils down to those three chords - I, IV, and V. Any other chord, in Riemann's early view, is a ""substitute"" of one of these three chords. For your convenience

* iii and vi are ""auxiliary"" chords to 'I'
* ii and vi are ""auxiliary"" chords to 'IV'
* vii^o is an ""auxiliary"" chord to 'V'

To think of it in a different yet convenient way, and V are ""Parents"" with ""Children"". I and IV share a child - 'vi' - which is unique to the vi sonority in a key. It can be used with a high degree of versatility. In some contexts, it could substitute for a IV while in others it could substitute for I. Another notable thing about the children is their relation to their parents by ""common tones."" The iii chord shares tones in common with I in any key, two to be precise. 

But if anything goes, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, and vii^o . What if we're in the Key of C Major but we want to use an Eb major chord? How do we rationalize this with our existing roman numeral schema? This brings us to ""borrowing"" sonorities. 

**Borrowing from other Scales and/or Modes**

Any scale is a mode. Understand that the C Major scale is merely the Ionian mode built on C. In today's terminology (this is different than when you first encounter the church modes, there are six primary modes we use. Our most common ones are Ionian and Aeolian, or Major and Natural Minor respectively. But we can divide the four remaining modes between being ""Major"" or ""Minor"" by the presence of a Major 3rd or a Minor 3rd (b3) above the tonic. So, we can say that when we're presented with a I-bIII progression that we have ""borrowed"" that bIII ""from Minor."" 

This is more case-in-point with the bVI, if we end up with I-bVI, we've borrowed an Ab Major chord that would result from the pitch collection of C Minor. In fact, when it comes to evoking modes, this is exactly what we do - we borrow from the mode we wish to evoke. 

Suppose we want a ""lydian"" sound in C Major. This is easily achieved by borrowing the #4 from C Lydian. Of course, which results from the same #4. Thus, when you see a progression of CEG to DF#A, this I-II progression is effectively a ""lydian"" progression. 

This works in minor as well. For example, and in Minor, we expect our Subdominant sonority to be minor - 'iv' - not IV. But in Dorian, we raise the 6 back to its natural state as it would occur in Major. This returns our Subdominant to a Major sonority. We say the IV in minor is ""borrowed"" from Dorian. Similar, we'd say the bII in Minor is borrowed from Phrygian, and we'd say the bVII in Major is borrowed from Myxolydian. These sonorities can be substituted, just like ""children of parents"", IV

**Summary** 

You should be able to take this and apply it to understanding any tonal progression. Take this as an example: |I|bVI|II7|bVII| With our understanding of Primary Chords, is that this serves to help all those asking about Chord Progressions here in /r/musictheory.

I'm not comfortable talking about the schools I attended because my curiosity could be perceived as criticism toward them

As a composer, perhaps a pedagogical issue I'm unaware of (as I haven't pursued a Doctorate), or if it's just a class that wasn't offered at any of the schools I attended, but I don't recall having the opportunity to study the principles behind this style of music in undergrad. Furthermore, in Masters work, I believe I experienced this overwhelming push toward post-tonal music (a.k.a. Modernism, Post-Modernism, which actually resulted in the entire composition faculty essentially conferring with one another on whether or not to even ""allow"" me to include some works in my portfolio. Ultimately

Basically, in my experience, I've never really found particularly useful in understanding popular forms of music today. For example, I learned about key, harmonic function, and modulation using Bach Chorales. This is of almost zero use to me in understanding most harmonic progressions in popular music today, mostly because none of those conventions seem to exist any longer. I don't see the use in setting students up by teaching them a concept using conventions that are no longer common. That seems, a form of obsolescence. 

If it seems vague, I don't believe the way they are delivered in the theory courses I took are particularly useful. 

For example, V/key is much less common than mediant relationships today. At the risk of overstating it, V/key almost defines classicism where mediant relationships tend to be more prevalent in popular music today. But in my experience learning theory, modulation was almost exclusively taught as V/key. I almost felt like I was just ""making s**t up"" when I started looking at popular music that modulates through mediant relationships. 

I could really go into a number of other things, it can go to any other chord; V is this other sonority, and it either goes to 'I' or 'vi'; and in between this, we have these ""sub-dominant"" or ""pre-dominant"" chords that can fill in the space between the beginning of a phrase and the end (the cadence). 

Okay, sorry for that - but it seems like several times when there's a question about a chord progression, or about modes, or about things generally related to popular music, the explanations are much simpler when explained in ""parent/child"" relationships than through traditional terms like ""Tonic, Pre-Dominant, Dominant."" 

I don't say any of this to toot my own horn or to leave anyone with the impression I look down on anyone here (and really, not as an hierarchy of function but as a parent/child kind of relationship between sonorities... like a parent/child relationship between Tonic and its children, Mediant and Sub-Mediant, for example... or Sub-dominant, it's step-child Sub-Mediant, and it's legitimate child, the Supertonic. 

Maybe I just missed a big chunk of this in my own education experience, perhaps as a reaction to Modernism. This is complete and utter conjecture, and I have no real ""proof"" that it actually happened. It just seems like it was there at some point, those who were lucky enough to learn about it and explore it brought it to life in Film and Commercialism, generally, and in many other areas, schools just outright eliminated or compartmentalized it in some obscure ""survey"" course.

_______________


There has been some, ""Why do we have to take theory?"" or maybe, ""What is the purpose of the assignments we complete in theory?"" People often question why they have to learn the ""rules"" of partwriting when composers don't follow them, and why so much emphasis is placed on common practice music when music being composed today does not use common practice music. 

**I. Core theory classes do not exist to teach you how to compose.**

Yes, you might have to write an essay, but it's not to teach you to become a novelist—it's to show that you understand the material enough to explain it coherently and clearly. 

Asking students to do model compositions is to test to see if the students are familiar enough with the concepts to produce them on their own. As you probably know

**II. Yes

Unfortunately

1. When you graduate from music school, for example, and you'll have to take remedial classes that will slow down your progress toward your master's degree. *All* schools in the US would have to agree to change the canon in order for the canon to be changed.

2. There are only 4 semesters/6 quarters to work with, these other repertoires like jazz, film music, *real composition lessons/classes*, and so on get relegated to upperclassmen electives. You still probably will get the opportunity to learn these things if you want to!

3. Common practice era music is studied because this is the repertoire that is most often performed. Yes, 80% of the time you're going to be playing Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich, etc. (or if you're a band director, people who write like those guys), and those guys more or less use the kind of techniques you learn about in theory class. Therefore it's the most relevant to your future career to be familiar with these styles.

4. Regarding serialism, it is not as transparent as tonal music. But if you approach atonal music with an open mind, you can find new ways to listen to enrich your experience. You might not go home and jam to Schoenberg on iTunes, but at least your mind will have expanded enough to learn what there is to be appreciated, as well as hopefully why that style existed and was such an important movement in 20th-century music (yes, even though strict serialism is rarely used by composers today). And don't you want to be able to comprehend as much music as possible?

editing to add here: I hope it's implicit in my comments

**III. A bit of a tangent regarding issues with the inclusion of popular music

At the last Society for Music Theory national conference in New Orleans

1. Popular music often doesn't abide by rules, and they may be used, but at the same time it sort of misrepresents popular music to pretend that that's the norm.

2. If you are hoping to include pop music to make class more relatable to students (the old ""this is what kids are listening to, especially in the age of Youtube and Spotify. Plenty of people enjoy pop music and are barely aware of Top 40 music, or Radiohead, or the Beatles, despite how much those examples may seem like common knowledge.

I might think of more later, and have ultimately decided that despite its issues, the theory curriculum needs to stay more or less the same. 

I'm excited to have discussion on this and clarify any points.

I've been learning about this stuff now going on nearly 15 years and still don't know everything. That said, as someone with a masters degree in music

**Memorizing and Using Major/Minor Scales in Music Theory**

There are plenty of ""process-"" based ways to construct a Major Scale on any note - the Whole-Step/Half-Step orientation and so forth - but in my experience

**Memorize the Following**

* C/D/E/F/G
* Db/Eb/F/Gb/Ab (Enharmonic Spelling - C#/D#/E#/F#/G#)
* D/E/F#/G/A
* Eb/F/G/Ab/Bb
* E/F#/G#/A/B
* F/G/A/Bb/C
* F#/G#/A#/B/C# (Enharmonic Spelling - Gb/Ab/Bb/Cb/Db)
* G/A/B/C/D
* Ab/Bb/C/Db/Eb
* A/B/C#/D/E
* Bb/C/D/Eb/F
* B/C#/D#/E/F

Take some time and commit these patterns to memory, so being able to recognize these patterns on the staff is also huge. Take some time and write these patterns out on staff paper. Spend an average of 3-5 minutes per day for the next few weeks doing this in front of a keyboard:

1. Play all 12 patterns on the keyboard. These patterns are five notes a piece
2. Write out all 12 patterns on staff paper using accidentals - #'s (sharps) and b's (flats).
3. Write out the Enharmonic spellings of the F#/Gb and Db/C# patterns. You might also go an extra step to learn the Enharmonic spelling of B/C#/D#/E/F# and of Ab/Bb/C/Db/Eb because you'll eventually come up against these spellings later.

**Combining Patterns to Create Major and Minor Scales**

To construct a major scale from any of these patterns

Example 1: The Eb Major Scale

1. Begin with the Eb 5-note pattern - Eb/F/G/Ab/Bb
2. Add the pattern corresponding to the last note of this pattern - in this case it's Bb
3. Now

This becomes increasingly easier to do, what it looks like, how it breaks down into two parts, and conveniently enough, it's a good lead into introducing yourself to harmony as the first chords you'll begin learning about come from these two patterns you combine to make a scale. 

Now

1. Begin with our Eb 5-note pattern and lower the third note by a half-step. The last two notes will overlap with the next pattern we'll add.
2. In this example
3. The Gb tells us what pattern to combine here. We end up adding Gb/Ab/Bb/Cb/Db. All we have left to do is cap the scale off with our Eb at the top. This gives us Eb/F/Gb/Ab/Bb/Cb/Db/Eb.

IMPORTANT NOTE: When building scales at the beginning level here, on paper, this will lead to many incorrect answers in theory class when applying scales. Notice how the way I spell the scale, Eb/F/Gb/Ab/Bb/Cb/Db/Eb uses each letter of the alphabet in consecutive order with no gaps or redundancy. This is important for accuracy on tests and so forth.

**Building More Scales**

From knowing your Major and Minor Scales, the way you build a Minor scale using these patterns gives you the Natural Minor scale for each pitch. The other two forms of the scale are Harmonic Minor and Melodic Minor. These only deviate on the 6th and 7th notes of the Natural Minor scale as follows. We'll keep using Eb Minor as our example:

Eb Major - Eb/F/G/Ab/Bb/C/D/Eb

Eb Natural Minor - Eb/F/Gb/Ab/Bb/Cb/Db/Eb

The Eb Harmonic Minor returns the **7th** pitch of the scale back to the Major mode. In this case

Eb Harmonic Minor: Eb/F/Gb/Ab/Bb/Cb/**D**/Eb

The Eb Melodic Minor returns **both the 6th and the 7th** pitches of the scale back to the Major mode. So we change Cb to C and Db to D and end up with...

Eb Melodic Minor: Eb/F/Gb/Ab/Bb/**C**/**D**/Eb

And you can actually compare these two variations of Minor against the Natural Minor and Major Scales to see that the notes that change through each orientation are either the third, more or less:

Nat Minor: Eb/F/**Gb**/Ab/Bb/**Cb**/**Db**/Eb

Har Minor: Eb/F/**Gb**/Ab/Bb/**Cb**/**D**/Eb

Mel Minor: Eb/F/**Gb**/Ab/Bb/**C**/**D**/Eb

Eb Major: Eb/F/**G**/Ab/Bb/**C**/**D**/Eb

Music theory is a breeze when you understand your scales and the patterns that occur between them. If you understand this stuff

**Using Scales in Music Theory and Analysis**

Now, **major/minor/augmented/diminished intervals** are a pretty big hurdle for some to overcome. Let's suppose we're asked to determine what is the interval from C to E... well, that's just all too easy if we know the scale:

C/D/E/F/G - First five notes of C MAJOR - C to E is a Major Third. 

And what about larger intervals above the 5th

Eb/F/G/Ab/Bb/C/D/Eb - since Cb is a half-step lower than the C in the Major scale, and then to Major. 6ths and 7ths aren't difficult at all when you have a context to work with.

**Working with Perfect

With intervals, Perfect Fifths, and there is also the Perfect Octave, which is simply the top note that repeats the bottom note of any major or minor scale. You don't need to understand why this is the case until well after you have this under your belt, so we're moving on for now...

Perfect intervals can also be lowered by half-step (we call this ""Diminishing"" the interval) and can also be raised by half-step (we call this ""Augmenting"" the interval). Any interval can be augmented. Unison intervals cannot be diminished. 

In theory, you can have an Augmented Third by raising a Major 3rd by a Half step. This can become ridiculously frustrating to remember without having something from memory to work with... like a scale or a couple of small patterns we can use to construct a scale in our head on the fly.

Suppose we're asked to write an augmented fourth above the pitch G... this is VERY EASY to do:

G/A/B/C/D - Fourth note is C

How about an augmented third above F? Here's an example:

F/G/A/Bb/C - raise the third note - A - to A#. You can see that Augmented thirds sound exactly the same as perfect fourths - A# sounds exactly the same as Bb. 

How about a Diminished 5th? You'll see these a LOT...

G/A/B/C/D - lower the perfect 5th above G

And maybe you have to DIMINISH a 7th

G/A/B/C/D/E/**F#**/G - the 7th of this scale is F#, so we remove the sharp. Now it's G to F natural, a Minor 7th. Let's make it a diminished 7th by lowering it again by a half step to make it - Fb - and now G to Fb is a diminished 7th.

This is really, Xylophone, Bells, etc.) within roughly 6-8 lessons on average. The best way to do this is in front of a keyboard and with staff paper.

Ante Up (Robin Hoodz Theory) features a brass/sax backing loop. It’s in F minor (with major IV mixed in), we have a repeated F-sharp in the alto, a clear, steady descending line in the tenor (F# - E – D# - D-natural), and a rising bass line (F – A – B – D).

The magic happens at [3:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4ovlm_Q2r4#t=3m34s). Just as Beyoncé gets back around to “If you liked it…” the descending brass line reappears.

In linguistics

* Isochrony
* Stress
* Intonation

A song's melody controls what pitch each syllable is

Take a sentence like ""I'm going to the bank tomorrow"". Say it out loud. You probably emphasized ""go"", and you squeezed all the extra syllables in the time between. ""I'm **go**ing to the **bank** to**mor**ow.""

This timing of the stressed syllables creates a sort of rhythm

In music, and measures, and it constrains where the downbeats fall in time, which is essentially where stressed syllables fall. When studying poetry, stressed/unstressed syllables are grouped into feet like trochees, iambs, dactyls, and so on. However

* l = / = ""long""
* k = u = ""pickup""
* t = /u = trochee
* d = /uu = dactyl
* p = /uuu = (primus) paean

The kinds of notes you use to write each of those feet generally depends on the time signature and the desired length of the syllables. This leads into my next point: given some lyrics and the stress divisions, C = crochet (quarter), Q = quaver (eighth), S = semiquaver (sixteenth). Brackets denote a tuplet.

In 4/4 time, we can give time signature a stricter meaning that's similar to the current one. 4/4 means each measure is four feet where each foot is a quarter note, and 6/8 (2/C.) means each measure is two feet where each foot is a dotted quarter note. 

Here are some examples from popular songs that help illustrate what I mean:

    Lyrics: Buy     it,     fix     it,
    Stress: /       u       /       u       /       u       /       u

By this definition of time signature, and the scansion would therefore be 4 trochees instead of 2 paeans and would fit this definition of 4/4 time:

    L: Can     you     |paint  with    all     the     col-    ours    of      the     |wind?

    R: C       Q       Q       C       Q       Q       |C      C       Q       C       Q--|Q

(In that last example, the syllable still sounds stressed.)

But this definition of time signature has some interesting implications. Technically, and MCC is one dactyl in 1/1 time. A combination of those foot lengths, like QSS QSS CQQ, would be more accurately 2/4 + 1/2; that is, two quarter-note feet and one half-note foot. A pattern like QQQ QQQ QQ, which in standard notation would only be obvious by adding accents to the notes, would be more like 6/8 + 1/4 (two dotted quarter note feet and one quarter note foot). A 3/4 measure with just a trochee, is still 3/4

So what's the point? I find it interesting to look at sheet music this way. I can take some sheet music and add additional time signatures everywhere to correspond with the feet in each measure. I also think being aware of these patterns can be useful in composition.

* If you're writing a parody of a song, the Portal-themed parody of ""Making Christmas"", ""Making Science"", has a couple lyrics that clash with the original prosody and therefore sounds dissonant (to me at least): The original goes ""It's ours this time"", stress pattern u / u /, but the parody goes ""She's awake now"", stress pattern / u / u.

* Certain rhythms can be substituted without changing the prosody. In general, long, trochees, dactyls, and paeans) can be written as an n-note combination that fits in a beat, and the first note (which is stressed) can be tied from the previous beat. For example, the ""every"" in the second example (a dactyl) can be written as a triplet. Any QQ can be written as Q.S or (C Q)

This also raises some interesting questions:

* Isochrony is a property that's language-dependent. English and German (and I think Mandarin) are stress-timed languages, so it probably wouldn't sound right if you give French syllables varying lengths. Perhaps stress-timed languages have more machine-gun-like rhythms? Does a French translation of an English song sound weird?

* To what extent can these rules be sensibly broken? Try singing a song but offset all the syllables by one note. It sounds weird, but wrong place: it's what I call ""prosodically dissonant"". Now offset all the feet by one beat. It sounds better, but still off; probably has something to do with the cognitive processes behind what we perceive as measures. Of course, sometimes it's appropriate to use a different stress pattern to create a slight dissonance. For example, ""somebody"" is / u u, but in ""Somebody I used to know"", it's given u / u, as well as u u /.

Here's the scansion of that line:

It was a nice mix of theory and ""write-from-the-gut"" style of composition. It has chromatic harmony, maybe this will be useful. I think it's a pretty cool story about how I mix writing from instinct and writing with my head.

[A link to the finished tune for the impatient](http://soundcloud.com/brnz42/baxters-bounce) (As the bass is pretty critical for the feel

* This song started out with me messing around on my [cigar box](http://imgur.com/QNi78) [ukulele](http://imgur.com/Ri6XP) with a descending minor-third riff, with a B-natural. Figuring I had something that was kinda cool, I decided I was borrowing the first chord from Lydian Mode, and decided to go from there. 

* Now that I had a basic idea, I tend to just figure out a skeleton of chords, and then make it resolve cleaner later (as you'll see). [I expanded my original riff, and made a little melody out of the chord tones](http://imgur.com/OeY32). At this point I knew I was writing a jazz tune, and just played by ear on my bass until I had something I liked. Yes it's simple, but I was far from done. 

* Since I wanted to make a jazz tune, Amin7, Gmin7, F. I loved the sound of it! But something was strange. The voicing I was using for the Bmin7(b5) put the D on bottom (ukulele only has so many voicings, you see). At this point, I decided to rename the first chord Dmin6, as it really sounded like an alteration to the vi chord in the key of F. 

* This is pretty common practice, as I was using it here. By playing Dm6, I was making explicit a commonly implied concept. This started to make the B-natural that I had started out with just by accident into a really hip note. 

* Now that the first chord had changed from a Bdim to a Dmin6, but wanted to make sure F sounded like tonic when we got there, so I added a ii-V-I at the end. [With a new progression, I expanded the melody](http://imgur.com/nRjCp).

* At this point I was almost done. Sine I was writing a jazz tune, and decided to just use an open solo over a rhythm changes bridge (A7-D7-G7-C7). I made two changes, I made the D7 into a Dmin7, to again emphasize the relative minor relationship. I also added a C#dim7 in the last bar to lead back to the Dmin6 of the A section. This makes for a nice chromatic C-C#-D root motion. 

* That is pretty much it. I made two ending for the first riff, then decided to record a demo.

* I recorded this in three quick takes in pro tools. First take was my walking bass line (I'm a bassist by trade), and the uke tracks have a slight chorus effect (more so on the comping, which is lower in the mix). [Finished Audio](http://soundcloud.com/brnz42/baxters-bounce).

[The Tritone Paradox](http://deutsch.ucsd.edu/psychology/pages.php?i=206) starts with computer-generated tones that are designed to be a specific note (ie C#), and others will hear them as clearly descending. In truth, these tones are neither ascending nor descending, because they are ambiguous as to which octave they are in.

What's weirder is that people are internally consistent, and another person might hear just the opposite. And there's some evidence to believe that these differences might be regionalized and be related to speaking patterns (another point connecting the music and language centers of our brains).

&gt;*You come over with all of your friends*

&gt;*And all their opinions I don't want to know*

&gt;*And I'm looking over my shoulder*

&gt;*Booking away with nowhere to go*

.

~ KEY AREAS ~

First, we have a brief tonicization of G major.    But at the end of the measure, we have a bizarre passing chord like a Gm7, leading to Bb.  These two chords could be interpreted as a tonicization of Bb for half a bar, but I’m going to save time and argue that the Gm7 chord is a transition to a Predominant function in F major.

The F major switch, the V – I motion of the last measure acts *BOTH as a deceptive cadence leading to a MAJOR VI chord, AND as the return to the home key after a flurry of wild modulation.*

*How fucking cool is that?*

.

~ ANTICIPATIONS

There are so many functioning non-chord tones, the Bb.  On the one hand, it functions harmonically within a Gm7 chord.  However, that chord only lasts for half a beat, maybe a whole beat – one could argue it's just a transition chord to the Bb major of the next measure.  So it also functions as an anticipation tone, leading to the root of the following chord.  Many other anticipations function the same way in other measures, so it stands to reason this one would follow suit.

However, then the entire second half of the meas. 2 is theoretically Gm, and beat four is an unusual 3–b3 suspension.  Although its function seems far-fetched, the melodic contour of playing a note, repeating it, then descending mimics a common suspension chain.  And that motive is the basic building block of this progression.

It further demonstrates that Smith’s anticipations often act like suspensions

.

~ CONCLUSION ~

Everything is not as it seems.  In true fashion, Smith created a doozy of a chorus to fit his haunting lyrics.

.

**TL;DR: MODULATIONS BE CRAY.  FUNCTIONAL ANTICIPATIONS EVERYWHERE.  ELLIOTT SMITH’S A BAMF.**

I have somewhat recently begun responding fairly often on this subreddit in an effort to improve it and make it a more informative place. There are a couple of things that I think would improve this subreddit greatly

**1) A more academic atmosphere.**

A quick glance at the subreddit will show you that an overwhelming majority of the posts are questions from less experienced musicians asking for help from more experienced musicians on various topics of music theory. Very rarely are these questions even matters of interpretation; usually

To me, scientific answers to their questions, ideally even backed up by citations. I think that r/musictheory would be greatly improved if we treated it as a more scientific or academic subreddit. I think people looking for answers would be happier if they knew that the people responding to them were giving them the right answers. 

Personally, or that they teach jazz piano lessons. The point of this would be that whenever someone reads an answer to a question, they will know the perspective that the responder is bringing to the table, as well as their credentials. That's not to say that one kind of person's response will always carry more weight based on what flair they have; different questions are better answered by different types of people. Having flair that quickly and easily identifies the experience that a person has will help with this.

Along with this, don't take offense or be stubborn! Think of it as a learning opportunity. Again, imagine you're posting in r/askscience and an actual scientist corrects you on some misinformation you have. Personally, I'd appreciate being corrected.

**2) Updating the sidebar.**

We get *so many posts* on this subreddit asking for intro materials for music theory, rather than rehashing the same discussion over and over again.

Also, and [/r/musichistory](/r/musichistory). Adding them to the sidebar will increase their subscribers, and ours if they reciprocate.

Excuse any typos; I can't copy-paste and so I'm just typing it quickly.

&gt;*[beginning on pg. 197]* The whole question of the status of hte notion of the overtone ""system"" (surely not a system, and that of its predecessor—the divisions of the string, must occupy a central place in any discussion of musical theory. Naturally, since I am not concerned with normative allegations, I cannot be concerned here with the invocation of the overtone series as a ""natural"" phenomenon, and that application of equivocation which then would label as ""unnatural"" (in the sense, it would appear, what music, and nonharmonic

&gt;But what is, tonal pitch system? For it to furnish the criterion of the structure of the major triad it is necessary—first—to append the independent assumption of octave equivalence, for to assert that the overtone series itself supplies this criterion because the octave is the first interval above the fundamental, or the interval determined by frequencies whose ratio is a power of 2, et cetera, obviously is to adjoin independent assumptions of the euqivalence-priority of the first interval, or of the intervals determined by the power of 2, the independent assumption of the significance of the number 6, the principle which permits one to proceed from the assertion that ""associated with a given frequency produced at a given intensity by a given instrument are other frequencies"" to the assertion that ""such other frequences always may be explicitly presented on any instrument simultaneously with a given frequency"" must be combined with another rule which prohibits this process from continuing

&gt;And still, even in relative terms, whether one asserts the independent assumption of adjacency or of relation to the first partial. Under the former criterionn, the fourth would be termed more consonant than the major third; under the latter, the minor seventh and the major second would be termed more consonant than the major or minor sixth, or the minor third. The concepts of consonance and dissonance have induced centuries of a comedy of methodological errors, from the rationalistic stage,"" without its having been clear or inquired at any time as to the object of the rationalizing or the experimentation. Clearly

&gt;One can continue with the overtone follies, and as instancing the property of consonance, which, wiht the property of nonconsonance, describes the two basic states of a composition which determine the modes of succession to the next state, octave equivalence classes (identical, in this body of literature, the major scale (as completing independently the concept of consonance and providing the criterion for proceeding from state to state). These concepts hardly suggest the postulation of an overtone series as a master concept entailing them. 

Milton Babbitt, 2011): 197–198. This particular essay that I've excerpted was first published in 1965, under the title ""The Structure and Function of Musical Theory"".

Would you lot be interested in a collection/individual applications which are interactive? A first idea is to have a key selector which will visually display which notes are included on a keyboard/guitar. Expanding from that time signatures and other basic theory at the beginning

Any suggestions as to what could be included, any input on theory or useful books/websites to gain the knowledge from would be cool.

1360287598.0,183qki,Modes - What are they?!,musiktheorist,52,9,31,"I've seen a lot of posts about the modes


**What are modes?**

When people refer to modes

1. The church modes - the concept of these were developed from Boethius in the 6th-century and were tweaked and altered well through the 17th-century.
2. The modern conception of modes as diatonic scales that are created from being on a different ""white note.""

**What are the church modes?**

Church modes refer to the 8 modes that were created in a way to codify the Gregorian chant repertoire (they were meant to classify monophonic music.) The history of church modes is a long and complicated one, has disseminated to his students.

1. The modes truly developed in Greece with the school of Pythagoreas. They determined basic theoretical premises we take for granted, and giving notes letters.
2. Boethius (5th century) translated this Greek theory into Latin. Unfortunately
3. Hucbald was the first to link the four finals of the eight modes to the letters D, and G. Each had an ""authentic"" version, starting on the final and divided at the fifth above the final (fifth+fourth). They also had a ""plagal"" version which started a fourth below the final and was divided at the final (i.e. fourth+fifth).
4. Whoever wrote *Alia musica* is probably glad to be anonymous! This person(s) conflated the word *modi* and *toni* (the psalm tones) since there were 8 of each. In addition

Break...now I can tell you the eight modes. These were developed and refined in the 400 years after said Anonymous to get the modes we generally refer to today as the church modes. **The final is listed in bold.** *The recitation tone (also known as the repercussa or psalm tone) is in italics and lower case*

1. Dorian: **D**-E-F-G-*a*-B-C-**D**
2. Hypodorian: A-B-C-**D**-E-*f*-G-A
3. Phrygian: **E**-F-G-A-B-*c*-D-**E**
4. Hypophrygian: B-C-D-**E**-F-G-*a*-B
5. Lydian: **F**-G-A-B-*c*-D-E-**F**
6. Hypolydian: C-D-E-**F**-G-*a*-B-C
7. Mixolydian: **G**-A-B-C-*d*-E-F-**G**
8. Hypomixolydian: D-E-F-**G**-A-B-*c*-D

Note: Though Lydian was understood as the F-F mode

Then

Glarean identifies ""Ionian"" and ""Aeolian"" as the C and A modes and their plagal partners respectively. He notes there is a mode from B-B

Theorists after Glarean attempt to define polyphonic characteristics to determine mode

**Why Bb in Lydian?**

The church modes are based on the Greater Perfect System, he developed the hexachord ""ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la"". Between each of these notes in the hexachord is a tone *except* between mi and fa, when the hexachord was applied to the letter F

Some composers began to distinguish between this ""soft"" b and the ""hard b"" (when B was a tone away from A.) The hard b was drawn as a b with rigid edges. This eventually developed into our ""natural"" sign in music. The ""soft"" b had rounder edges and looked very similar to a flat accidental. Eventually it developed to be this way.

As a result, since singers would have inherently known this note needed to be only a half step away from A. As a result, most works began to notate a signature of Bb for Lydian modes.

**Can the church modes be transposed?**

The answer is yes, but only a fourth down. This commonly would add a flat to the key signature (except in the instance of the Lydian modes which no longer needed a Bb in the signature). These ""transpositions"" were only achieved because some guy got the idea that the whole Greater Perfect System (i.e. the gamut) could be transposed down by a fourth.

Thus

**Final note about church modes**

Works weren't necessarily composed in church modes--and definitely not akin to how composers composed in keys. Even composers who self identified what modes they were writing in were basing their modes from theorists who couldn't agree on how modes functioned in works. 

**What are the modern modes?**

The history of modern modes is a little less clear and how they developed. However

There are seven modern modes. There are two ways to think about modern modes - one being as diatonic scales starting on different notes to the C-C scale. Thus:

1. Ionian - C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C
2. Dorian - D-E-F-G-A-B-C-D
3. Phrygian - E-F-G-A-B-C-D-E
4. Lydian - F-G-A-B-C-D-E-F
5. Mixolydian - G-A-B-C-D-E-F-G
6. Aeolian - A-B-C-D-E-F-G-A
7. Locrian - B-C-D-E-F-G-A-B

These modes, one can think about the patterns of tones (T) and semitones (S).

1. Ionian - T-T-S-T-T-T-S
2. Dorian - T-S-T-T-T-S-T
3. Phrygian - S-T-T-T-S-T-T
4. Lydian - T-T-T-S-T-T-S
5. Mixolydian - T-T-S-T-T-S-T
6. Aeolian - T-S-T-T-S-T-T
7. Locrian - S-T-T-S-T-T-T

They can also be compared to the major (Ionian) and natural minor (Aeolian) keys and described with their characteristic tones:

1. Ionian = major
2. Dorian = natural minor + raised 6
3. Phrygian = natural minor + lowered 2
4. Lydian = major + raised 4
5. Mixolydian = major + lowered 7
6. Aeolian = natural minor
7. Locrian = natural minor + lowered 2 + lowered 5

The modern modes are identified first by the starting note of the scale, a major scale with raised 4.

As to what makes a composition in these modern modes--typically composers, these are difficult to distinguish. **Modes are mostly a melodic phenomenon** thus identifying chord progressions in modes can be at times frivolous.

There are six different periods of classical music, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Twentieth Century. We are focusing on the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic eras. In today’s blog post


**Classical**

Following the flowering of music in the Baroque era under the guidance of masters like Bach, the Classical period saw the emergence of structured instrumental forms that we all familiar with: symphony, concerto, sonata, and chamber music. Unlike Baroque music, classical music featured shorter melodic passages, homophony (i.e. melody playing over a chordal accompaniment), dynamics

 
Notable Composers


**Franz Joseph Haydn**


Known as “The Father of the String Quartet”, Brahms, and Schubert.

“I was never a quick writer

 
[Farwell Symphony](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQcj-tV52ow)


Symphony No. 45, was written by Haydn in 1772 for his patron Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy while he and the court orchestra were at the prince’s summer home. Due to the unexpected length of their stay, many of the musicians were homesick. In a subtle attempt to suggest to the prince that the musicians would like to go home, Haydn wrote the last movement of the piece in a unique manner. In the final adagio of the piece, each musician would stop playing, snuff out their candle, and turn away


[Surprise Symphony](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Cs_f3GupCo)


Symphony No. 94, in a otherwise quiet passage, is stylistically typical of the sudden contrasts in dynamics Classical period music is known for, the unpredictably loud chords in Haydn’s piece were designed to wake up any members of the audience who fell asleep in the slower movements.

The important part isn't that he's playing an F major... it's that he's giving it that gospel color with the 13(#11)

Too often the parts are explained purely as slash chord (play a Bb in your left and a Ab chord in your right)

It's usually in a format like:

Eb | G Bb Db Gb

But for every single chord.

fresh like - **UH** / impala - **UH** / chrome hydraulics / 8-0-8 **DRUMS** / you don't want - **NONE** / n-- betta - **RUN** / when beef is on i pop that **TRUNK** / come get - **SOME** / pistol grip **PUMP** / if a n- step on my white air **ONES** / it's red **RUM** / ready here i *COME* / compton UH / dre found me in the **SLUMS**

This brings us to the end of his first 8. Notice that the rhyme the entire time has been on the syllable ""uh""; Game continues this for the next 8 (an incredible thing to do, 1/2 bar, 1 bar, a 2 bar grouping repeated three times (for a total of 6 bars,) until the final two bars of the first half of his 16, when he accelerates the phrasing and has the rhymes divided into 1/2 bar, 1/2 bar, 1/2 bar. This same structure is used for the next 8, Game begins to vary where the rhyme falls metrically, and stops with the word ""slums""

sellin that *SKUNK* / one hand on my *GUN* / i was sellin' rocks when master p was sayin *UHHHHHHH* / buck pass the BLUNT / these G-Unit girls just wanna have **FUN** / coke and RUM / got weed on the *TONGUE* / i'm bangin' with my hand up her dress **UH** / i make her *CUM* / purple haze in my *LUNGS* / whole gang in the *FRONT* / case a n- wanna *STUNT*

As mentioned before, he elides that 1 bar phrase into the first 2 beats of the next phrase, making itself really a 1.5 bar phrase, and eliminating the 1/2 bar phrase that came in its parallel structural position in the first 8 bars of his verse here. But what really interests me here is the metrical placement in the rhymes of ""uh."" Look back at the preceding paragraph, and see how the rhyme changes between being italicized (falling on the beat) and being bold (falling on the 2nd sixteenth note of the beat, a characteristic rhythm of the synth bell riff.) Game sets up the listeners expectation, begins to vary them at the end of the first 8, varies it even further. The contrast is heightened by the fact that the 2nd sixteenth note of the beat in 4/4 is a highly syncopated place to put a note (which he does in his first 8 bars), and high hat) all strongly accent the bar as discussed before. They contrast greatly with Game's continuing manipulation of the accent of his verse. This is why I can't listen to the song without bobbing my head: I'm listening for the accents of Game's rhymes against the driving rhythm of Dre's drums. Finally, like Dre

1300182378.0,g4aox,How to master key signatures and spell any diatonic chord.,Confoundicator,41,8,10,"I've seen questions asked about this sort of stuff.  Here's my contribution!  First of all

How many flats are in the key of Db major? 5

What are the notes in a C major chord?  C E G.  What about F# minor?  F# A C#.  How about E7#9?  E G# B D F## (yes F## is the same as G, so the #9th is F## because there's already a G# in the chord).  


I just typed all that without looking anything up

Step 1.  Memorize the circle of fifths.  Just do it.  Look it up on wiki.  Remember ""bead GCF"" if that helps you.  There's a thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/g3r7x/i_released_a_free_online_course_that_teaches_a/) with a lot of good comments about learning the circle of fifths.

Before I continue


Here's my biggest tip for key signatures: 


When counting sharps, E has F# C# G# D#, etc...


When counting flats, Ab.  Ab has Bb Eb Ab Db, and so on.

Step 2.  Memorize the ""circle"" of 3rd's.  Nobody calls it the circle of 3rds, like so:

A C E G B D F A C E G B D F A and so on.

Don't bother remembering flats and sharps


All diatonic chords are spelled with notes in this order



Step 3.  Memorize all of the chords derived from the major scale, lower case minor,  vii^o is a diminished triad, like so:

I  ii  iii  IV  V  vi  vii^o  I  

This is exactly the same as:

C Dm Em F G Am B^o C

Commit this to memory.

Step 4.  Put it all together.  To spell a chord

What are the notes of a C major chord.  All chords are spelled in thirds so right off I know that the letter names are C E G.  Next I note that the key of C major has no sharps or flats

F major.  It's spelled F A C.  It's the IV chord in C major

What about an F# minor chord.  First of all the notes are F A C without accidentals.  Next up I know that F A C is the IV chord in C major, F# minor.

How about E7#9.  This one requires that you know how a dominant 7th chord is constructed.  The letter names are going to be E G B D F.  With no accidentals (in C major), but it's technically correct to call it F## (in any diatonic key there should only be one of each letter name, and either flats or sharps but never both, this excludes notes from outside the key of course).  The other way of looking at this one is to recognize that a dominant 7th chord is probably a V chord, so this chord could be in the key of A major or minor.  In A major we have F# C# G# so we can spell it E G# B D F#, then we have to sharp the ninth to F##.  A minor would be the same as C major, except using a G# from A harmonic minor

The general idea is, then you modify those notes according to either the key signature or your knowledge of how chords are spelled, referencing everything to the chords in C major to determine chord quality.  


TL:DR:

Understand basic chord construction and intervals before starting.

Memorize the circle of 5ths to learn how key signatures work.

Memorize the ""circle of 3rds"" as a tool to spell chords.

Memorize the chords derived from the major scale as another tool.

Put it all together and be able to spell any chord.

I would supplement this with practicing sight reading and lots of ear training and transcribing.

I have been playing/writing music on my own for about six years now. (piano is my primary instrument) I understand basic music theory but have never had any formal education. Up until now i have been primarily focused on art and am currently a junior at a prominent art college

Some of my heroes are:

[Trent Reznor &amp; Atticus Ross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTB6HmZNJ5s)

[Philip Glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkof3nPK--Y)

[Aphex Twin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiVe_4UVhEE)

[Jonny Greenwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ij_TEK_MM)

It was first really confirmed in me that this is what I want to do with my life when I watched the film [Koyaanisqatsi](http://www.putlocker.com/file/87BB3A0A28455374) (score by Philip Glass). Put to any other soundtrack those images would evoke a completely different emotion--but Glass' use of tension and dissonance created such a profound feeling of anxiety and unrest it reached into me on a wildly existential level. I am really inspired by the ability to communicate with people through music

**What kind of school I'm looking for**

Firstly let me preface by saying that I have a very limited knowledge of the music industry. From my understanding you can either try and make it as an independent artist, or become a producer. Otherwise I'm not really sure what sort of career paths are available. So any advice you guys can offer I'll take to heart.

As for what sort of school I am interested in: I am very interested in music theory as well as music production. So something that takes an academic approach as well as teaches you tools for the studio. Atmosphere is a factor too. Preferably somewhere in/near a larger city (I live near Chicago but am open to going anywhere)

Where did you guys receive your education? Do you wish you went somewhere else? Any and all direction you can offer me is greatly appreciated. If you have any questions for me I'd love to hear them. **Thank you**


Also
If there would be a more appropriate subreddit for this question please let me know :)

I cannot gush enough about the ridiculous awesomeness of this particular song, this song warrants a music theory discussion all on its own, given that this is r/musictheory and in this song alone there is so much to talk about!  This is my attempt to deconstruct the song, using as little esoteric music theory jargon as possible (you'll see it's impossible to do entirely without - LEARN YOUR THEORY!) and it will no doubt be long and rambling.

Before we begin

The question: what makes ""Us and Them"" sound so damn awesome?

The quick and easy answer is the vibe.  The overall slow, really makes this the ""drift into space inside your head while Steve rolls that other blunt"" moment in the album.

The instrumentation, Breaking Benjamin fans.

The organ cranks in the choruses with the Leslie and all ten fingers on the keys, rainbow-colored curtain behind the song.  In this song especially one can see the prism on the cover, with the white entering, the rainbow exiting, and that green line that's totally on the album cover but not on the poster or other paraphernalia.  The fact that Rick Wright plays a different inversion every time really makes for an interesting trip through the song.  The complexity that lies beneath the surface of the keyboards in the song alone is amazing to me.  This song has been one of my favorites since I was old enough to actually understand music (age 13 or so).

The quiet, you can hear everything that's going on behind it.  There is such a proper amount of space in this song that if you're listening for it, everything you could think of scrutinizing can be discerned.

It also helps that this whole album was produced incredibly well, but when I try caking on the reverb, it sucks.)

The verse melody is simple, and has lots of room for breathing (and consequently vocal support).  Oh, and on the second time through the verse pattern, the harmonies at the end really add a unique peak to the end of an otherwise static melody line (""...which is which and who is who?""), preserving the original lyrical matrix (i'll get to that) without being monotonous.

Before I dig into the lyric matrix, the sax lines *definitely* swell and ebb, and even the drums get louder and softer.  The whole song has a slow, rhythmic breathing pattern that actually...will...regulate...your...breathing!  This song is literally calming you down, riling you up just a hair for the chorus, and then setting you back down.  By the time this song abruptly ends and spills into ""Whatever Colour You Like,"" you're almost renewed and ready for the next three songs.  Besides

Now for the real gem of this song, the words, the phonemes and how they interact.

The matrix is as follows:

    One and two.
    And one and two
    Three and four.
    And three and four
    And two.
    
    A and a B
    fill some space
    A and a B
    Fill some space

All the words plug-and-play into this.  Four times through

Notice also the fact that all of the words chosen are liquid.  Lots of voiced consonants, both standing alone. *(Edit: forgot about ""sat"" and ""map"" in the first chorus.)  Almost every word ends in a voiced consonant, the words chosen are mostly monophthongs as opposed to diphthongs and have a gentle, rounded quality (at least in the English dialect - sung in a South Carolina accent this song might be a bit harsh).

...and yeah

What the hell mode is this song in?  I don't know.  D is definitely the tonic

There are six different periods of classical music, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Twentieth Century. We are focusing on the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic eras. In today’s blog post

**Romantic Era**

Part of an artistic, the Romantic Era began in the late 18th or early 19th century. This new era of music, which arose out of dissatisfaction with former musical formulas and conventions, focused on freedom, passion, movement, and human emotion.

**Sergei Rachmaninoff**

A Russian-born conductor, Sergei Rachmaninoff, “the maestro” helped shape romanticism in Russian classical music. Rachmaninoff was truly one of the greatest Romantic Era composers with his rich and distinct orchestra arrangements, structural ingenuity, and melodic lyricism. Rachmaninoff was not only for his compositions; he is today still remembered as one of the most formidable pianists of all time.

For informed readers, the work of Jerry Balzano, Roger Shepard or maybe Fred Lerdahl.  The theoretical bases are certainly there, and many students of these people are savy with C++ and are creating applications based on their work.  Will the established music industry notice the increasingly diverse array of applications out there?

I guess the real question is whether Yamaha or someone similar will decide to manufacture a hardware platform that is somewhat in competition with the (digital) piano.  Because isomorphic pitch spaces preserve the shape of chords and scales across all keys

It may be that a hardware platform is simply too static

Here is an example of Jerry Balzano's space of major and minor thirds

EDIT: I suppose the Monome could be utilized for these purposes.  However

EDIT 2: Many people are making a good points about pre-existing string instruments with partial isomorphic spaces (barring the shrinking of intervals as you ascend).  Examples are guitars tuned in all fourths, viola, violin).  Also, accordions.  

EDIT 3: For people who use the Monome or similar controllers: Do you ever use it to control pitch

I thought I'd begin a thread about those contemporary composers that you feel stand above the rest and will be remembered by Music History as the ""great composers"" of this generation. I know that a lot of this is speculative and won't be known fully until we see the music they complete before their death and the impact their music has on future styles

One composer I definitely think falls into this category is Kaija Saariaho. The most obvious reason for this choice is the fact that she is one of few women composers who have gained such attention and respect in the musical community. Musically

This ability to balance complexity with approachability

this is all given that the higher string is a perfect 4th (5 frets/half steps) above the lower string. and the person tuning isn't using a guitar tuner.

one of us argues that a person should use the harmonics on the 5th and 7th fret on the lower and higher strings respectively

one says that using the fret method will bend the strings and create a note that is slightly off and therefore not as good to compare frequency to. the other says that using the harmonic method will make the open strings tuned by just intonation

and if anyone has anything else to say about guitar or other string tuning

EDIT: It seems that this all depends on purpose of intonation. i was inspired to do some calculations myself by using [this chart of A-440 equal temperament tuning](http://www.vaughns-1-pagers.com/music/musical-note-frequencies.htm), string length, and so the 5th fret method is in theory, more accurate.  the latter method, however, only had a 1.2% margin of error, which is considerably small. but considering what many of you said about it being easier to hear the beats using the harmonic method

TL;DR the 5th fret method is *technically* more accurate in regards to established equal temperament/straight-fret tuning,False,,t5_2qrjj,1355712854.0,,highschool,t3_14ym0o

1325968340.0,o72lf,[Discussion] AotW - Für Elise,FynnClover,28,3,16,"Heya r/MT! First of all

Essentially I'll go over the overall form and harmonic progressions and anything interesting I found in the piece. 

Für Elise is in rondo form with the main theme as the A section and two contrasting sections in between. Essentially ABACA. 

**The First A Section:**
The key is in A minor and starts with a minor second motif starting on the E (5th of the scale). In the following measures the chords move back and forth from i and V in an arpeggiated manner. The first big change is after the second ending when it moves to the key of C major

**The B Section:**
This section is where it starts to get interesting. It leads into the B section using three chords in very quick succession III7-VI-III7 in A minor, are all in second inversion, 6/4 which help push the chords along. By the seventh measure of the B section, the piece changes keys again to C using the same motif that was used to originally change the key to F. Brilliant! (It's even further established by the strong I-IV-V chords being repeated over and over.)

**Transition into the Second A Section:**
Just a quick note here that by using all the step wise motion in the right hand

**The Second A Section:**
Not much has changed here.

**The C Section:** 
This was the toughie for me. Beethoven has the section be very unstable with the chords in the right hand

When the pedal A moves up a minor second to the Bb in the last measure of page 2, E major.

**Transition to the Third A Section:**
Just in case the listener forgot what key they were in, but then chromatically until it naturally falls back into the minor second motif. What a way to transition!

**The Final A Section:** 
Nothing new to see here really. :)

All in all Für Elise is a simple piece built on some very interesting ideas used to transition and keep harmonies moving. 

Comment on what you thought about my findings (agree/disagree) and anything else interesting that you find! Let's tear this piece apart. :)

I'm currently involved in an independent study dealing with Spectral Music.  My inquiry into this musical style will use analyses of timbre

The only article I've read on the subject, he develops an approach to timbral analysis based on 3 primary parameters: timbral width (how focused the sound is around the loudest 1/3 octave frequency band in the texture at a given moment), sharpness (the frequency position of the loudest 1/3 octave frequency band), and Roughness (acoustic dissonance created by beating between partials).  These three parameters are graphed separately and can be traced throughout entire pieces.

The article was written in 2000, though it is convincing.  Does anyone know any other articles or books on timbral analysis?

And when we hear a song in a different key it only sounds weird or different because we are used to hearing the original key.

1333600354.0,ru6h3,What pie REALLY sounds like,gilnim,34,9,34,"Edit: Lol
Edit 2: Also

Some of you may have seen [this youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOQb_mtkEEE&amp;feature=youtu.be) which claims to know what pi sounds like. I personally was not satisfied and believe they should have called it ""what a song based on pi sounds like"".

My formal argument:


Going off of the stipulations given in the video:

pi to the 31st decimal = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795



Based on a C Using the major scale starting at C4 (middle C) we can determine that: 

1=C4

2 =D4

3=E4

4=F4

The frequency of E4 is 329.628 Hz

The frequency of F4 is 349.228 Hz


We know that 3&lt;pi&lt;4

We shall refer to the 'frequency of pi' as 'pi Hz'

if pi = 3 + x


Substituting E4 into the equation

We can now switch to measuring in frequencies; we shall use 'x Hz' to represent the frequency value of x


pi Hz = E4 Hz + x Hz
or: Frequency of pi = 329.628 Hz + x Hz


We must now determine the value of x Hz


The value of x when 3&lt;pi&lt;4 will be proportionately equal to the frequency of x when E4&lt; pi Hz &lt;F4


Written as an equation we have: 3&lt;pi&lt;4 = E4&lt;pi Hz&lt;F4
or
3&lt;3+x&lt;4 = 329.628 Hz &lt; 329.628 Hz + x Hz &lt; 349.228 Hz


We can simplify 3&lt;3+x&lt;4 by subtracting 3 from each part of the equation so we get:

0&lt;x&lt;1; or 0&lt;0.1415926535897932384626433832795&lt;1


We can also simplify the Frequencies in the same way:

0 Hz&lt;x Hz&lt;19.6 Hz


Now we have 

0&lt;0.1415926535897932384626433832795&lt;1 = 0 Hz&lt;x Hz&lt;19.6 Hz


We now know that the Frequency of x is in between 0 Hz and 19.6 Hz. We can determine the exact Frequency value of pi using the proportions determined above shown in this equation:


(pi – E4)/(F4-E4) = (x Hz – E4 Hz)/(F4 Hz – E4 Hz)

(pi – 3)/(4-3) = (pi Hz -  329.628 Hz)/(349.228 Hz - 329.628 Hz)

0.1415926535897932384626433832795 = (pi Hz -  329.628 Hz)/(19.6 Hz)

0.1415926535897932384626433832795(19.6 Hz) = pi Hz -  329.628 Hz

2.7752160103599474738678103122782 Hz = pi Hz - 329.628 Hz

332.10321601035994747386781031228 Hz = pi Hz


The frequency value of pi in a C4 Major scale is 332.10321601035994747386781031228 Hz

First things first

So this song is pretty crazy. I'm trying to make some sense of it harmonically

So the main theme. The piece started out with the Dmaj right hand ostinato with the 1 7 6 b6 octaves in the bass which leaves us with a I, then a weird.. bvi7 chord which stacks up as a Bb D F# and A. So that's a major third major third minor third making a weird sort of augmented major minor 7 chord? I'm probably thinking about this totally wrong.. but that's what I can gather thus far. 

Then come the lyrics ""to the daily mail... together, vi I guess?

Then surrounding the lyrics ""you made a pigs ear you made a mistake it has this crazy cool modulation thing thing. The piano plays an arpeggiated C major triad with an Eb on on top then an arpeggiated Db major with the Eb still being played until it arrives at a Eb major triad. It repeats this a few times and I honestly can't make any sense of what's happening. Is it just some fancy mode mixture or a modulation? My friend says he's tonicizing the neapolitan

Yet I wanted to hear some broader discussion, but we have to draw a line somewhere. I don't even know how to properly and professionally describe good pianist (to distinct them from above average ones, yet doesn't necessarily require superb skills and extraordinary spirit seen in the best ones, like Gould, Kissin, Lisitsa) and how many years of experience it requires at least (as I never was playing on the piano). I guess I'll accept whatever pros here will conclude in that matter.

So... are there any known and acknowledged limits of the good pianists that composers should take into account? Like staccato on 32nd note cannot go beyond 160 bpm or something alike? How better great pianists can do? Are there resources covering such topics? Not every composer is a good pianist before

1366359472.0,1co37h,Tips for music theory edits of Wikipedia by knowledgeable music theorists.,robertinventor,21,1,5,"Hi

Anyway - might be interesting to share my own experiences and things I've found useful. My particular area of interest is microtonal music

Mainly I do minor edits or at most add a new section or sections to an existing article. I have contributed one music theory article

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexany

I have had my share of reversions and deletions - and the hexany article itself was nominated for deletion originally - but have worked through them

So anyway what I've found helps is - first of all - that if you have loads of citations in new material - to well established scholarly articles - then only the most knowledgeable of editors will question it and no-one will do an instant revert of what you wrote. The editors knowledgeable enough to question what you wrote will be very likely to have something interesting and useful to say about it too.

For music theory, if you can back it up with a citation, it is well worth doing.

That's the main difference between contributing to wikipedia and writing an academic paper or thesis. In an academic paper  you only need to back up the more recondite things with a citation. On wikipedia you need to add citations even for many things that most in your field regard as obvious.

So - well for things that are obvious to everyone in your field - they are not likely to be the actual point of the academic article. But that doesn't matter, or a couple of them, and add them as a citation to the article and the chances are high your edit will never be reverted.

The reason is - on wikipedia - no-one knows your credentials. So you can't use your authority as a basis for saying things. That's both a weakness and a strength of the way it works. 

So - if you just edit an article to change something that is mistaken, and is just putting forward an individual eccentric ""original research"" idea.

Once they realise that it really is a genuine

Sometimes though as some of you said

Also it might sometimes be hard to find citations for something that everyone in the field regards as obvious.

In that sort of situation, so long as it is on topic. It will just be commented on (hopefully). So you can say whatever you like. 

Then, and for minor articles then it stays indefinitely).

So - just by mentioning it on the talk page you already help some readers (I often go to look at the talk page of articles to learn more and find out if there were alternative views not mentioned in the main article).

Then - you might well get no replies to your suggestion. If so

If you do that - then it is highly unlikely that your edit will be reverted. While exactly the same edit done without a mention on the talk page first is quite likely to be reverted.

If you do get a reply on the talk page then you can engage in discussion. I've engaged in one or two like that. Can be quite long but with patience you can usually work through it to a mutually amicable solution that is also accurate. Any criticism or misunderstanding gives you an opportunity to express your intended edit more clearly

In my experience that approach works very well indeed.

Also - it takes patience and it takes time. A few years ago many areas of Wikipedia were extremely low quality. Now many of the same areas are high quality.

You are unlikely to be able to fix all the issues instantly. But if each knowledgeable editor works on a few small areas of interest to them and where they are highly knowledgeable - or fixing obvious mistakes where a citation or a pre-mention on the talk page can back it up easily - then over months and years the issues will eventually get sorted out.

I haven't come across any particular editor that was an issue in my particular area of microtonal music and complex rhythms and the metronome. But if that does happen - well enough citations

I went ahead and preemptively registered /r/ArrangeMusic so no one can coup me out of it. Now, I still have a few questions that I'd like to get answered about the endeavor:

1. Is it legal? The arrangements would all obviously be free for anyone to print

2. Does anyone else just arrange music in their free time, etc)? I used to put hours into arranging video game music for this ensemble I put together, and I know that I'd be doing arrangements anyway, but I really would like to make sure it doesn't end up that I'm doing over 75% of the submissions, despite the fact I only submit something once a week or so. I know there are a lot of gifted musicians on this subreddit, I'm just curious how many would be interested, especially since I'm pretty weak at arranging for voice. I'm also sort of afraid that we'll get 10 or so submissions right off the bat

3. What sort of sites would be good for file hosting? I was imagining each submission would optimally lead to an external file hosting site's page

4. Do people want free sheet music? I put a rule in that you can't post requests for arrangements because I was afraid that it would end up being just a plethora of requests for arrangements. At the same time, not only would I want music that I wanted to perform, but it would also have to be music that I had the proper ensemble for. What would the chances be that someone would happen to submit an arrangement that you could not only use, but wasn't some niche piece that your ensemble couldn't really appreciate? Also, most of the arrangements I have are for string orchestra or concert band. What are the chances that someone who selects repertoire for large ensembles like that would subscribe, then actually have something they could and wanted to perform? In short, would this actually be useful?

Dm9 Gaug | C Baug | Gm/Bb A7 | F F#dim C/G A7 | Dm7 G7 | C Baug | Gm/Bb A7 | F F# C/G A7 | Dm7 G7 C

Now, and Gm/Bb, the E on the A7.  I don't consider this to be the bass despite being below.  Whatever.  So here's my question: how do I analyze that?  I feel that the B+ chord is a B chord and not a G chord, despite it being equivalent to G+ -- the B is simply not heard as a leading tone, and the A in the melody is more like a B+7 than a G+9 chord; it's actually reinterpreted as the 9th of Gm the next bar.  So I'd do it this way:

ii9 V+ | I V+/iii(?) | iv6/ii V7/ii | IV CTo (common-tone diminished) I64 V7/ii | ii7 V7 | I V+/iii | iv6/ii V7/ii | IV CTo I64 V7/ii | ii7 V7 I

First, considering that the I64 can be heard as a kind of V chord.  Second, is the I64 a passing 64?  Most importantly, am I analyzing the I V+/iii iv6/ii V7/ii correctly?  I feel like the Baug to Gm/Bb is a very smooth chord progression, but V+/iii to iv6/ii doesn't make that clear at all.  The four chords have the feel of a sequence, and I can easily see why if I spell them out:

C E G, A C# G

The G stays, so what is the actual function of all those chords?

EDIT: I'm rethinking the B+.  I'm now thinking that it's a B7b13 (given the A in the melody), since there's no iii to resolve to, unless the iii is actually a iiiø43 with no root, and I think we can all agree that's a ridiculous proposition.",,False,,1345957624.0,t3_yu5g8

1340530952.0,viq7g,A tritone concept I picked up from the end of Colorado by Grizzly Bear. ,Joheem,25,5,11,"Two tritones are available in every key

They are the tritones found in the dominant chords leading to the root chord and the root chord of the relative minor. 

For example, the tritone found in E7.
The second is F to B

G#, and B are the notes found form a diminished chord, with any of those 4 roots.


There are three sets of tritones/dim chords: C family tritones


E
F
F#
G
G#
A
Bb
B
C
C#
D
Eb

Thus the diminished chord of the key can start on either the major 2nd, or major 7th of any key. 

Also, F#, and A, notably consecutive sets of relative minors) all can use the D family tritones. The keys starting from the C# family (C#, E, G, Bb) all have the C family, F

It seems strange to me that we spend years (at least in the US) in undergraduate school having the ""rules"" of diatonic and tonal harmony crammed down our throats.

Obviously, or vocational tools (if you're writing jingles and/or film music). But it seems pointless to focus so intently on an analytical (as opposed to generative) method aimed primarily at the old styles, and which mostly fall apart when getting into even 20th century music, let alone this century's music. 

I have always been told, he's just writing progressions that mess with the functions of chords. 

Can someone give me an actual reason why I would need to know the rules of 16th century counterpoint in any other setting than writing 16th century counterpoint?

My friend and I (both grad students in composition) had an interesting discussion on the terminology still used to name the aesthetics from the ""impressionists"" to the ""spectralists"" (Murail

It all began because I read a document which named the music from Debussy and Ravel ""renouvellement"" --- renewal music. Which I thought was interesting since they might not be impressionists in the first place. I thought it would be good temporary term which could include other composer from 1889 to 1945 (Schoenberg, Stravinsky, etc.) since they all had one thing in common: they contributed to the dislocation of the tonal system (I used a litteral translation from the French, sorry if you use another term).

My friend, even if the composers aren't really impressionists. Since it became a common and accepted terminology, and we know what we are talking about when we use this term.

This document was a program note from the Ensemble Intercontemporain from IRCAM.

So

Is renewal music an acceptable term which would take in count enough of the composers from that era?
If not


Do you have any problems with other terminology such as modern

Is there any other names of aesthetics that annoy you?

I've been teaching myself to play the ukulele, and I noticed that if I played C -&gt; Eb -&gt; F on the C string, when I play the F it sounds suddenly bluesy (especially if I bend the note)!

What I know:

* Major/minor scales of every key.

* Identifying/playing every chord that can come up in a jazz book

* Some basic rules of counterpoint.

* Identifying intervals by ear/by seeing the notes (Although I sometimes make mistakes at some intervals).

* The fact that a mode is the major scale which begins at a different note

* Some orchestration knowledge (is it theory?)

What I don't know:

* Names of anything.

* Inversions of chords (I know what they are since I'm a pianist but for me a G minor is a G minor whichever way you play it.)

* What tonic dominant etc. are (you can include it in names)

1368739514.0,1eh5u5,"Stigma toward ""Harmonic Dualism?""",nmitchell076,18,4,52,"Hey everyone

I'm currently reading Richard Cohn's Audacious Euphony: Chromaticism and the Triad's Second Nature.  There are a couple of passages that he devotes to defending some of his positions from potential (or actual) objections that could be raised.  Some of these objections seem obvious and, precisely because it isn't immediately apparent why it would be problematic, the objection that his system is inherently ""dualist"" in nature.  

For anyone with this book

Dualism, since the term is identified with the discredited harmonic dualism of Oettingen and Riemann under which the triadic transformations were initially conceived."" (37)

A couple of questions stem from this.  

1) what is the harmonic dualism that Oettingen and Riemann proposed

2) Why is dualism itself, therefore it is wrong"" if it is formulated in an independent manner?  Shouldn't that dualism be judged on its own merits and premises rather than rejected outright? 

I ask these because as a reader, but rather on melodic dualism and their inherent connection through minimal voice leading makes sense to me... but if he doesn't explain why harmonic dualism is discredited, I can't reasonably conclude that his arguments are sufficient to distance himself from harmonic dualism.

I appreciate any responses!",,t5_2qrjj,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/1eh5u5/stigma_toward_harmonic_dualism/

I love cyballius. Anyway
I'd suggest the following rates:

* real fugal esposition......................................$70

My orginal post to this wonderful subreddit led me to start looking for other sources of information.

I stumbled upon this [review](http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.00.6.1/mto.00.6.1.rawlins.rev) of The Jazz Piano Book in which he brings some very harsh criticisms of Mark Levine's methods.  He basically calls them shortcuts.  I will add an excerpt that is relevant to the chapter on scale theory.



""[6] The most glaring example of this bias concerns a fundamental concept that permeates Levine's entire book--that of chord and scale equivalency. This view
(7th, and 13th), and accordingly can be reinterpreted
as some type of (usually) seven-note scale. For example
chord symbol Dm7
possible 9th, and would therefore be seen as
equivalent to the Dorian mode. It is an indisputable fact that
many jazz musicians share this view
usefulness of this approach is not to be denied.(2) But in
establishing chord and scale relationships Levine seems to lose
sight of the fact that triadic progression is still the
underlying harmonic force driving most of the musical examples
presented in this book. A statement of such direct simplicity as
""the scale and the chord are two forms of the same thing"" (p. 33)
is an exaggeration and grossly misleading. A Cmaj7(9
serving as a tonic chord in the key of C and the same chord
serving as the subdominant in the key of G share the same notes
and may both be thought of as verticalizations of the Lydian
mode
diatonic context
improviser. Among other things
the key
true relationship of scale to mode more accurately when he
writes,
when they improvise
terms of chords"" (p. 32). But it may be necessary to think in
terms of chords when diatonic function is a significant component
of the harmonic motion.""

He then lists several sources as ""good examples""

And brought him to highest esteem.


**Some blank verse for the larf**

While walking in the church one day

Old Machaut had a thought.

""I'll write a mass to Nostre Dame

By now I really ought.

I'll fill it full of isorhythms

... With those it will be fraught

And by future students of my art

Its meaning will be sought.""
