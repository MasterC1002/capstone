1360594699.0,18b6p8,Tips &amp; Tricks in the SkyDome,matdwyer,109,5,73,"Jays fans - let's get a little collaboration of tips &amp; tricks that people may not know about the SkyDome. If we can get this big enough maybe we can sidebar it. Try not to encourage anything illegal or likely to get you in skydome jail (i.e. sneaking booze in)

Here's some of my best:

• You can buy a ticket in the 500 levels but stand at the railings on the lower bowl

• You can go any time to the lower levels from the 500 level - if they try to stop you

• Budweiser runs a program for Designated Drivers - go to the customer service desk (one up and one down) and fill out a form to get a free pop (I got a free bottle of water once

• You can watch the game without buying a ticket by going in the hotel entrance &amp; then turning right - this is ""Arriba"" and it's fairly expensive, $15 for a chicken caesar wrap with fries. I went to watch monster jam there and got nice n' drunk for the same price as my ticket would have been.

• You can bring in almost ANY food from outside - I've ate full pizzas

• If you PM me I'll be happy to share cheap parking around

• If you're drinking hard and you want to make your money last, etc) and leave after the 4th/5th inning. Jet over to St. Louis across the street or to the Union Station LCBO, drink a couple beers, and head back in. You'll miss an inning but save money compared to buying those atrociously priced beers (I've got my ""reentry"" ticket for as little as $2)

• A good deal on scalper tickets is 25% under face value for decent games ($40 baseline tickets for weekend matinees). The key is walk up with money in your hand

• If you get to bobblehead games late

• The nachos at the 100 level market thing are decent (expensive

• As people are leaving you can buy/get their ticket off them (i.e. if they were in the 100 levels) and then you can go sit in their seat. 

• You actually win stuff on twitter tuesday - currently wearing a Vote Jose shirt haha. The Budweiser trivia before the game is won by the same people all the time but try to beat them if you can. If you go to a lot of games enter the text in to win things every time

• You can drink for free (usually 1-2 beers) at Steamwhistle before the games

• There is a tour you can take of the Skydome - I haven't done it yet

I know when I go to away arena's / stadiums I look for threads like this,False,,t5_2sb61,False,,,t3_18b6p8

I know it would get in the way of your ""anti-everything"" posturing but as a supposed sports analyst maybe you should think a little deeper than that:

AA inherited a mediocre farm system with few genuine top prospects

Now for more like 70M we have locked up Morrow, Lawrie, Rasmus, Bautista, Edwin, Lincoln, Janssen

Barring a complete outlier number of injuries

Plus our farm system is the most improved by far of any team.

AA has now said that he thinks we are near that point where free agent signings are worth it

It's coming together - despite how the injuries have skewed it for now.

We're spitballing the idea of more celebrity/athlete AMAs. There are some feelers with some of the blue jays staff (non-player)

Thank you all for keeping the atmosphere conducive to a positive and lively discussion about our favourite team. The passion that you all have and the interest Canada's club is definitely something we appreciate and hope that it continues as it has. 

We're almost at 2, Rangers, Angels, Cubs, Tigers and just behind the Cardinals.

* Welcome back! The Jays hit the diamond tonight to start their 2013 campaign
* One of the main parts of that retooling is on the mound for Toronto tonight. R.A. Dickey won the NL Cy Young last season with the New York Mets.
* John Gibbons also makes his return to Toronto tonight
* Cleveland has undergone something of a rebuild themselves, and Michael Bourn, under the leadership of former Red Sox skipper Terry Francona.",,False,,t5_2sb61,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torontobluejays/comments/1bjge1/game_thread_april_2nd_toronto_blue_jays_vs/

I was looking at my fridge magnet schedule today and was shocked to realize the season is winding down, I am going to grab the bull by the horns and get a /r/TorontoBlueJays game day meet up started.  

When: Friday September 13th.  Hope you're not superstitious.  Game starts at 7:07 pm  

Who: our favourite bird bros the Baltimore Orioles vs the Toronto Blue Jays.  And me and you.  And you

Where:  Pre-meet up drinks and/or food ~5pm at Shoeless Joe's on Queen's Quay.  Why Shoeless Joe's on Queens Quay?  It's a 5 minute walk to the stadium box office but is off the main drags of Front St and Bremnar Blvd
  
How much: It takes 20 people to qualify for a group rate, anyway, so just bring cash and we'll grab 500-level tickets from the box office around game time.  ~$15-$20  
  
Post game we can plan an after party with whoever is interested or go our seperate ways into the night.  
  
So
  
Hope to see you all there!

Last year in this sub there were questions almost every game about where to find a stream of the game for those of us who don't have MLB.TV. Since spring training games have now begun and people are filing in it seems like a good time to post this.

The answer: vipbox.tv. If there is a Blue Jays game on TV there is a 99.99% chance it will be on vipbox. All you have to do when you're on the homepage is click on baseball and then find the Toronto game. There will usually be several links to choose from

I also would recommend you get the ad block plus add on for Firefox because the amount of ads is insane. I'm not sure what the ad block equivalent is for chrome so if someone could post it that would be appreciated.

It's generally considered that the Japanese league is mid-level AAA talent.

From: http://www.nationalsarmrace.com/?p=3008

&gt;Japan: the Nippon Professional Baseball League rates, perhaps close to MLB level.  However, the prevalence of mediocre players from the US going to Japan and being super-stars seems to indicate that Japan is no better than AAA, and may be a bit weaker.  And, not to claim this is about talent levels per race, but there have only been a very small number of Japanese-born players who were really impact players upon arriving here.

I ran into a problem though

Using [Baseball-Reference's data yearly data from the Japanese League](http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/league.cgi?code=JPPL&amp;class=Fgn), triples, stolen bases, times caught stealing, and times hit by pitches for Kawasaki. (If anyone wants them, I can provide these equations.)

Combining my tabulations with the Japanese Ball Players website

AB|R|H|2B |3B |HR |RBI |BB|K|SB|CS |HBP|
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
4573|620|1343|186|51|27|369|323|527|245|93|54|


I entered these into the [Major League Equivalency calculator](http://mlsplits.drivelinebaseball.com/mlsplits/mlecalc)

---------------------------------------------------

**TL;DR**:

So with all that being said

Emilio Bonifacio (600 AB)|600|86|156|21|8|3|37|52|135|0.260|0.319|0.339|39|10|2|

In terms of their major league careers


Kawasaki's currently hitting .225 /.337 /.325 with the Blue Jays. So he's hitting lower than his MLE Career batting average

Bonifacio's currently hitting .205 /.236 /.307 with the Blue Jays. So he's hitting lower this season in all three slash categories.

## Notes

* [Game Preview](http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_04_12_tormlb_kcamlb_1)
* Happ is coming off what has been by far the Jays' best outing by a starting pitcher this season.  He went 5-1/3 giving up no runs and only one hit against Boston.  
* Mendoza gave up two hits and one run in six innings against Philadelphia in his last start.  
* The Jays are looking for a long outing from Happ after overworking their bullpen in the first nine games of the season.  He needs to be more efficient with his pitches after giving up three walks and striking out six last start.

I don't post to reddit very often

1. If the past three years have meant anything

2. He's a class act. Spent a good half hour at spring training in 2011 signing autograph after autograph

3. Follow him on twitter @RADickey43 - his tweets are interesting, in between starts, will spend a few hours answering questions via twitter ranging from baseball intracies, to the inane things about his life.

4. Read his book, intensely personal and conveys his voice clearly. 

5. Look forward to him batting in interleague play. He takes every at bat very seriously

6. He has a nasty pick off move

7. He's an overall awesome guy. Loves and understands baseball. Tremendous competitor. 

8. His bat are named after Lord of the Rings swords

9. He owns a screen print shirt of Jose Reyes. Somebody get the guy an updated Toronto one

10. The documentary Knuckleball

[Here are pictures of Dickey in the Reyes shirt

Enjoy every one of Dickey's starts. They're often electric (especially when he's got his strikeout knuckler going.) I'm certainly going to the Bronx to see him beat the Yankees this year,False,,t5_2sb61,1355787147.0,,,t3_150qp4

This latest stretch has really shown that we can win any number of ways and we should expect to beat every team we play. The lineup is solid and the pitchers are solid. We have the combination of speed and power to play any situation.

It is not like we will keep winning every game for the rest of the season, the schedule doesn't matter. What does matter is: Can our pitchers keep pounding the strike zone, can our hitters keep coming through when it matters.

Looking forward

-Keep Edwin at 3rd

-Slightly less of a rotation in the middle infield and keep Bonafacio and Kawasaki ready to run for someone late and as late defensive replacements.

-When Reyes comes back, and more opportunities for the other top-of-the-lineup guys to have two speedsters on the basepaths for them.",,False,,t5_2sb61,False,43,

I'll do my best to answer these in a concise manner.
1) They will. RA Dickey cost a lot, due to him being in the NL with the Mets. Reyes gives us an elite top of the order shortstop. We all know he is capable of leading the league in average and steals. This guy excites me to no end. If Josh Johnson is healthy and finds his stuff from a few years ago, we may have another ace in our rotation, and Mark Buehrle is the definition of consistency.

2) Melky will not be a distraction. He will be eager to put any questions from last year behind him and let his play do the talking. He is a good defender in left field

3) It will prove to be dominant. Just look at the names - all of them save Buerhle could be number ones on most other MLB teams (assuming we get 2011 Ricky, and which Ricky Romero are we going to get? He doesn't have the added pressure of being a number 1, and he has something to prove this year. However, he is a player who performs well when he is confident as we saw when things started to fall of last year, he really struggled. Being bumped down to number 4 in the order must be hard to take, but hopefully it lights a fire in him and he shows the league what he can do.

Folks in Toronto are high on this team.  They love the youth and energy and minor league depth of our team, this year.  And if the hype is to be believed, Brett Lawrie will be elected to the Hall of Fame on November 1, 2012.

Outside of Toronto, and Tampa Bay.  Nobody really expects them to make the playoffs this year, though all are sure they’ll finish way ahead of Baltimore.

The truth

The lineup is solid one through nine.  The trouble spots seem to be 1B, that’s more than enough.  Colby Rasmus, however, seems like a lost soul.  I saw a game in Florida last week, and he looked down on himself even before entering the batter’s box.  He was too in his head, never made solid contact.  His defence will carry him, but I worry for the kid.

On the mound, on the other hand, has a higher ceiling.  I feel good about him putting it all together this year, becoming a pitcher and not just a thrower.  If he wins 18 and K’s 240, I would not be surprised (on the other hand, he’s fragile enough to fall apart and post a 4.50 ERA).  After that, obviously, though I worry he won’t be durable enough for a full season.  The other two spots in the rotation are filled with question marks

I don’t see the team making the playoffs this year.  And that’s okay.  We’re still young, Lind’s back hold up, etc. – we could certainly contend.  But too much has to go right for that to happen.  I see the Jays winning 85-87 games, contending for the second Wild Card for a couple of months during the middle of the summer before falling off in September.  And I see them being a whole whackload of fun.  There are too many young and energetic players with exuberant personalities for them not to be a hoot to follow.
