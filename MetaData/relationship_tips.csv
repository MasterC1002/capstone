1334973297.0,skpfv,Relationship Tip: Will solve pretty much everything,Pilot824,84,12,27,"There are 3 main points to this post.

1. **If you're not happy in the relationship, before breaking up for what ever the reason is, is to talk it out with your partner. If you're a guy who likes watching gay porn, and she gets offended when a 3some comes on, or WHAT EVER THE CASE IS, talk about it with your partner; However, if it doesnt work out, then I say end it. Mind you


2. **Never get back with your ex. You broke up for a reason, over 1/2 a year ago, I'm still miserable about what happened last. But, the best way to move on is to ignore them, and start dating other people (if the case may be it). I know how it feels to break up with one of those other people that knows pretty much everything about you, and you have a bunch of inside jokes with them, etc. But you have to move on.


3. **If he/she actually likes you, then there is a bit of an issue. For example: if I am talking with this one girl, we hit it off one night, start dating and she finds out I love playing Xbox/PS3, and she cant stand it, it goes back to my 1st point of talking it over. If you feel that you cant live without your xbox/PS3, and she wont accept it, than to be your actual self. You will find a girl 1000x more attractive if she is into what you're into.


And that's it. If these tips don't solve your problem, don't plan TOO much on what you want to say because 9 times/10 its not going to happen that way, and just relax. There's more people out there than there is with that one person.


**EDIT:** There are

**EDIT2:** I was reading a few posts online about more relationships. And going back to point 2

&gt;As a person that has a few years on you (I turned 40 two weeks ago)
She's the worst kind of person.
Go listen to some good Delta Blues with a good bottle of Bourbon and some friends
You'll be a much stronger man because of this.

When They Don’t Love You Back
FEB. 11


There’s a strange feeling that sometimes overcomes us when we’re reaching out to someone, and our efforts to connect as friends or lovers is one that only complicates things for them. We want to say, “I’m sorry that I want to talk to you, it’s weird and I should probably stop.”

The thing is, always starting the conversation. You realize in a way that is at once terribly humiliating and almost masochistically sweet that you are the one chasing after them. When they grant you with their reciprocity, with their attention — nothing feels better. But most times you are left sending a message that you immediately regret, because you know that it only puts one more tallymark in the “you need them, and not the other way around” column.

There are few things more painful than feeling like you’re constantly going out of your way for someone who is, but it’s mostly directed towards yourself. You can tell when you send them a good-morning text message, or mail them a gift, or take the time to do something for them that you know they’ll barely appreciate — this isn’t going to be reciprocated. This isn’t going to be really appreciated. Hell, it may not even be noticed. But you can’t stop yourself.

It’s just a sad, familial) there are always going to be these uneven relationships in which one person is constantly left feeling as though their emotions and their desires are a mild irritant. There are going to be friends we go out of our way for who never quite acknowledge us in return, who will never be there to listen to our problems, who will never drive out in the middle of the night to pick us up when we’re in trouble — no matter how much we do these things for them. And there are going to be lovers with whom we long to construct an entire relationship, but with whom we will always feel stuck at the frustrating “beginner phase” where no exchanges go beyond the superficial. It just happens.

The most difficult thing, I have watched as more than one friendship proved themselves to be entirely one-sided, when my attempts to connect with the person (even in forums as non-committal as sending a Gchat), were proving increasingly pathetic. I was just way more into them than they were to me, and there is always a certain amount of pain in admitting that. You don’t want to confront this person and tell them, “Hey, look at all of these nice things I do and efforts I make for you,” because it is a sad thing to do.

It’s sad because the truth is that they don’t owe you their friendship or their love. They don’t owe you the same kind of relationship you desire from them. You can’t insist, and it is always their choice to make if they one day decide they want to start reciprocating.

But to break the cycle and force yourself to stop initiating contact, it’s always a battle. And it’s one we’re almost always guaranteed to lose. 

Tl;dr: a description of how it feels to not have your feeling reciprocated.",,t5_2sa5c,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/1grcz9/a_heartbreakingly_realistic_essay_on_unequal/

Randomly, I realized I found myself sort of interested in her. She, on the other hand, seemed absolutely uninterested in me. She would constantly call me ""bro"" (we don't hang in the same group of friends), and would constantly give me shit anytime I would try some sort of flirting with her.

Regardless, and I felt as if there might be something a little more. From there, I told her she should come over and I'd make her dinner and we could watch a movie.

The dinner and movie went well, and immediatly we regret the decision. There are TONS of birthdays going on at the bar, and they take up almost all of the seating. Being the proper gentleman, I seek out some seats and we sit behind a rather large birthday party.

We laugh, a drunk party-goer walks up to us and hands us two pieces of cake. We were a little leery at first, and just sort of stared at each other. Out of nowhere, she shoves the cake into my face, and I quickly retaliate. People around us are laughing hysterically, but we're just sitting there, staring at each other, so I kissed her. She pulled away and cracked a smile

I have never had a more amazing first kiss in my life. Covered in cake, or where my life goes.

*The letter is the first letter of her first name. The number represents the numerical order of that letter---S1 could be Samantha

*  D1----We were in first grade. There was something about you that made you different from the boys
You didn't have cooties that's for sure. I remember saying ""the captain of the losing soccer team at recess has to kiss"" you. After winning the first month of school
*  J1----Our second grade class was rowdy preparing for the Christmas show. I suggested to the music teacher to make us sit boy-girl. You taught me that a face that pretty was worth the wrath of (some of) the other boys.
*  C1----I was in third grade and you were in fourth at the school dance. I couldn't take my eyes off you. You taught me that slow dancing was actually great
*  R1----After moving across the country
*  J2----My family was suspicious when you called on a Saturday night. I was in fourth grade and too shy to admit a girl was calling. I pretended you were a wrong number. I spent two years trying to forget you at a different school. You taught me that girls do not forgive being ignored. 
*  J3----My first love, and I knew in your eyes we both wanted more. Nothing happened for three years. Then in high school, we went out again. I finally got you alone in your driveway at 2am and then it happened. My first real kiss. Not an elementary school peck like before. I mean a *high school* kiss. It was everything I hoped it would be for the previous six years. You were an amazing kisser. We dated for awhile, but you said it was just too awkward. You taught me that being escaping the friend zone, albeit temporarily, was indeed possible.
*  T1----I had no interest in you
*  A1----I had my (then) best friend ask you if you liked me because he was dating J3 above. I was looking for someone else
*  G1----After the good Baptist girl of J3
*  B1----You spent the last two and a half years of high school snickering at me with your friends because you thought you were out of my league. It occurred to me years later that I was out of your league because you stooped to that level. You taught me that 12 women working together can be sadistic bitches.
*  J4----J3's best friend. You were tall, and that's okay.
*  S1----Your constant innuendos playing billiards at my friend's house showed that maybe you were interested. You always said you wanted me to stick the blue ball in the center pocket as hard as I can. But you said that to every guy and repeatedly to me. You taught me to talk to girls to gauge their interest
*  S2----You yelled at my good buddy B for helping your friend avoid trouble by taking the fall himself. You taught me that standing you up for Homecoming was the best revenge.
*  A2----You taught me that big tits do not a great personality make.
*  N1----You taught me that I couldn't compete with a college guy that you weren't over yet.
*  K1----You taught me that I shouldn't listen to lesbian rumors. You said they weren't true after you landed a prom date.
*  M1----You were my first love interest at college. I wanted so bad to kiss those lips
*  K2----You taught me that a girl with a kooky religion is a dealbreaker.
*  C2----You taught me that a perfect ass and a 4.0 GPA were all that some women had to offer.
*  E1----You taught me that being way too religious of a nonkooky religion was a dealbreaker.
*  R2----I still have issues with you two Presidents later, and a tight pussy with a perfect bush. I thought we were gonna get married. I thought you were the one. I thought I was in love. I was in lust, and I was just getting laid. Nothing more, nothing less. We were long distance, and I loved skipping class to fuck you for seven hours off and on when you came to visit. But I found out in a chat room from one of your exes that you two were still having booty calls and that I was terrible in bed. You didn't tell me I was doing anything wrong and I asked repeatedly. I should have known when you just laid there. Driving five hours to surprise you at your birthday party was a mistake seen as three of your former partners (and one current one other than me) were in attendance. You just stood there and didn't get excited and I left in tears. All that after telling me that you had had sex one time before we met and you were afraid a virgin like me would dump you. I don't care about your sexual history. I care about the lying and the cheating. But if you were so experienced, why were you so terrible in bed too? You were a dead fish, but I had no basis of comparison. Almost a year together and not one blowjob??? You taught me that women could also be cheaters.
*  A3----I admit we hooked up in a bar because I was lonely and depressed thanks to R2.  You taught me that oral sex (giving and receiving) is amazing.
*  S3----My AOL fuck buddy. A little chubby
*  C3----I moved out of state after graduation for a job
*  F1----You were a stripper in a major city with the Super Bowl a few miles away. You taught me that a clothed handjob in the VIP room was indeed possible for free
*  J5----The best pair of lips so far. We met on a blind date and we fooled around in the parking lot of the restaurant. Our second date was you sneaking me into your dorm room, and then I fucked you twice. Then you wanted to go dancing for our third date. You taught me that, for some women, a man who isn't into dancing is a dealbreaker. I decided that you weren't worth it if you were so petty.
*  D2----We worked together for about a year. You took the long way to your car past my cubicle every day
*  J6----You were the first black girl I fucked. I was the first white guy you fucked. Online dating rocks. You taught me that no woman should go her entire life without someone eating her pussy.
*  D3----More online dating. The best phone sex I ever had. I hated that laugh of yours
*  C4----Another online date. Jesus Christ
*  L1----Yet another online date. We talked every night for a month. I walked into Starbucks
*  L2----We had some Chinese and a good movie or two. We started making out and I wanted those tits so bad. But I couldn't bring myself to take the next step. Is it really that big a deal that someone driving by 100 yards away might be able to see into my living room? You taught me that bossy chicks don't get fucked.
*  J7----I really liked you
*  J8----We had a few dates and some rather boring sex once. You were unwilling to even try oral (giving or receiving) even once. You taught me to never date a girl whose college diploma contains the word Christian.
*  L3----Online again. I drove 75 miles to spend the night with you on five consecutive Saturday nights. Your 14-year-old daughter gave me dirty looks as she headed out with her 22-year-old boyfriend to smoke pot at the Super 8.  You used to answer the door with that full length red dress wearing no underwear and it left nothing to my imagination. You were smoking hot and pretty good in bed for 21 years my senior. But your breath was too much to handle. You taught me that smoking was a dealbreaker.
*  A4----Online. You taught me that posting a photo of you 100 pounds ago is a dealbreaker.
*  Wife----A brilliant mind, long brown hair, and a sense of humor that doesn't quit. Double D tits, an hourglass ass, and a pussy that's ready for action five nights a week. Even after all these years together, being with you is still addictive. You are the love of my life. You were able to tame a lonely horn-dog because you were worth it. I endured two decades of loneliness for you and I'd do it a thousand times again.  Yes, I got laid plenty but I was still lonely. Nobody captures my heart, kisses my lips, but I can sure as hell try to be that guy. I can't wait for the next 60 years. You taught me that dreams come true.

1364522614.0,1b7tyj,I (32m) cheated on my ex-SO (28f). Here's the other side. ,stortiniaway,68,10,17,"First of all, and I wish what happened

The reason why I'm posting this is because of the huge amount of ""Emotional cheating"" and physical cheating posts that are prevalent lately here and in /r/relationships. I'm posting this is a word of caution to the people asking and to the people that are in the middle of it. For both sides of the coin. Here's my story...

I was happily dating my SO (lets call her Amanda)for 2 and half years when I switched jobs and met another woman (lets call her Christine). I don’t want to go into the details of me and Amanda’s relationship before then because it’s not important to the point of my post. I met Christine innocently as a normal hello and a chat about movies. Christine also had a boyfriend although it was long distance. We hit it off pretty well and all of sudden our friendship turned into something more. We texted, feelings, confessions. The worse part about it is that we both thought it was just a strong friendship. Later we realized that we were lying to ourselves. 

Our SO’s were guarded with their feelings for us hanging out and talking a lot. Amanda talked to me about it after another long texting session, we guarded our feelings for each other because we were committed to our SO’s (another lie to ourselves). Yet, we knew deep inside that it was more than that we just couldn’t say it. Amanda was always guarded even after she met Christine when I volunteered to arrange a meeting. 

We continued this though, I reconciled with Amanda and promised to cut the texting to a minimum. Christine was also having issues with her SO, and confessed to me so. 

Anyways, both me and Christine drinking heavily, we crashed at her place and one thing led to another. Afterwards Christine took it upon herself to break up with her boyfriend, knowing that sleeping with me was the wake up call for her to end it. Myself, I kept on thinking I could reconcile my feelings for Amanda while keeping my friendship with Christine (I know, ridiculous). But something happened and Amanda found out that something went on, and I confessed to her. Amanda still wanted to work on the relationship, and I couldn’t be with her. 

Here’s the lesson for the people asking themselves if they are being cheated on
1)	I lied to myself a lot because I thought I was doing the logical thing. I should’ve been honest with my feelings from the start
2)	What I did to Amanda was horrible and she’s still hurt from it. I will always be the asshole and deservedly so. I should’ve broken up with her long before that happened. 
3)	If your gut is telling you something is wrong, being the asshole, took advantage of that. 
4)	You’re not just friends. Friends don’t text each other late into the night. Friends don’t feel guilty seeing each other. I did for some reason
5)	Communicate, talk them out. I learned that the hardest
6)	Be honest with your feelings. Me and Christine lied a lot to ourselves for the feelings for each other. 

The point of my post is that I know I did something horrible and it shouldn’t have happened. I feel huge remorse to what I did to Amanda. Even though I think it was for the best (Me and Amanda were coasting and I wasn’t feeling invested in the relationship

In the end, but I’m still guarded from what I did to Amanda and what she did to her SO. At the same time, we know that and we are aware of those problems, we vow never to let that happen. I hope my post helps, and I hope that people see it in the light of advice rather than sympathy, I’m not asking for that.

1364512191.0,1b7hnk,A guide to No Contact (NC),LazyG,73,16,8,"This is a post I've been meaning to write for ages. Basically it's the composite of many replies I've made. It's here because I am a LazyGit ') and I tend to use copypastas for common issues. This is here to try and help people

&gt;
&gt;**NC
&gt;
&gt;NC is _No Contact_. It's a strategy for getting over a finished relationship. It's a very effective way to heal
&gt;
&gt;- What situations does NC work for? Do I need NC?
&gt;
&gt;NC is intended to speed the healing process after a break. Its goal is to make you OK again, as it lets you (And them) heal and get past the emotional trauma. NC is needed when you are not over one another. This is almost always the case after a breakup. Some fool themselves into say, thinking their ex cheated so they are over it, but the emotional trauma remains. the rare cases when NC is not needed is when you have grown apart so much the feelings all left ages ago. Occasionally you have people that grew from partners into roommates, and in fact NC is not needed as all they need is a change fo titles to be friends, not of feelings. Also of course couples with children's can't do NC - they have a need to communicate (a reason to pick your baby mommas/daddies carefully). If this isn't you, if you have feelings about the breakup
&gt;
&gt;- OK
&gt;
&gt;In many cases, and the other person feels that too, then NC sucks. You need to discuss the idea of getting together again. getting back together is OK,it's harder than the first time round and takes work but it can and does succeed. However you _both_ need to want it and _both_ need to understand what went wrong and how you will work as a team to fix it (no one person giving a shopping list of changes the other must make and hoops to jump through, those rarely work). The key here is you _both_ want it. One is not enough. 
&gt;
&gt;Ok so you are either back together or worked out thats not working as one or both of you doesn't want it. WHat next? Next you may want to talk. Not examine everything, it to understand so you can both learn. generally one of you will have more tolerance for the talk than the other, generally the ones dumped wants to talk more. But anyway, you talk until one of you has had enough, at which point you should stop. Pushing it beyond that is almost never constructive. 
&gt;
&gt;So now is when you start NC. It doesn't have to be sudden and unannounced, thats OK. In these kind of cases you can just cut the other person off, but if your split was less acrimonious than that then it often helps to say thats whats happening. You can explain that to heal, and if you want this to be able to be friend later you need space to heal and move on, and thats easiest without any contact for an extended period. If the other person understands this they will hopefully see it as a positive, and it really is the best way to end up friends as well. 
&gt;
&gt;- I want to say a last thing/end a last letter!
&gt;
&gt;Ok, 'what really happened', ' why you were really an asshole ally he time and now i realise it'. The problem is these don't help to send. If you feel the need to say this stuff the chances are they won't hear it. even if, say, you are worried about someones mental health, they won't hear it well from their ex, tell their family.friends instead. Other than this most letters/calls tend to be revenge. they are getting in a last hit, and you _don't want to have a conversation_ . People always think they can write ""don't reply"" etc but it never works. ANy talking to be done should have been in the initial closure phase after you split, then go out in the garden,along with the anger
&gt;
&gt;- But I'm so angry!/I want to show them how wrong they were/how much better I am!!
&gt;
&gt;The problem is, where you both leave the field bloodied and bruised. The battle is over, you need to go do something else now, or the anger will begin to define you. And you, whoever you  are, are better than that! In fact if you keep fighting, you lose automatically! You make your life about the other person. If you are defining yourself by them, showing them how hot you are,. This does't help you move on! That part of your life is over
&gt;
&gt;- Right
&gt;
&gt;NC is misnamed, who they are interested in now, or even how sad they are about the split. In the modern world the technological ways are to delete their contact details from your phone, mail client etc. _Block_ on Facebook (not delete or ignore, block so you don't just not see them, but don't say see their comments to mutual friends), unfollow on twitter
&gt;
&gt;Some things are tricky, put in a big envelops, seal it up and put it in your closet. Later, when you are healed you will want those memories, but not for now. In terms fo electronic stuff, if you need compress the photos to making them harder to access, you will need _some_ self control here
&gt;
&gt;As much as possible don't do things that mean you hear about them/run into them etc. It's going to fucking suck at first, but by excising them from your life for a while you give you the best chance of getting over it quickly. Then… get on with life.
&gt;
&gt;- How do I move on?
&gt;
&gt;The best thing is to _not_ sit at home moping. That may be useful for a few days at first. Then depending on your age and beliefs, you gotta move on. 
&gt;
&gt;Reddit standard advice: hit the gym, whether it's mixed martial arts or knitting, whatever. Choose activities that make you meet new people. Not to find the next partner, but because new people are a great way to wash away the crap in your brain. They make you think afresh, communicate who you are, approach new issues in new ways etc etc. Got a life goal you never tried, now''s the time! Evening classes in Spanish, cooking the perfect omelette
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;- How long do I do this for?
&gt;
&gt;Shitty answer, but thats not perfect. Lets say at a minimum it's measured in months, not weeks. It can be years in some cases. Sometimes it never ends, not because you are still angry and trying to do NC, but because you _moved on_ and don't really care any more. 
&gt;
&gt;If you want to consider wham to talk again or restart a friendship, but at some stage you become,… kinda OK with it. It's not like your favourite thought, butit's not terrible, and it does't stir up deep and nasty stuff int he dimly lit corners of your soul. 
&gt;
&gt;Of course the sucker is that to talk again
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;- What if they contact me?
&gt;
&gt;Again, unlessit's something genuinely urgent (like a legal issue) then just ignore them. Responses will lead to more communication. Just forget it and stick you _your process_, not theirs. 
&gt;
&gt;Ifit's persistent you can think carefully about who they would react to being told to stop. Think carefully as many of not most fo the people that will keep trying to contact you will take your response as an invitation not a rejection. However if you really think it will work (and be honest with yourself
&gt;
&gt;- What now?
&gt;
&gt;So you've done this, and become friends or not, maybe you don't and find new loves, new laughs and lives. But you move on with a whole, healthy heart - or as much of one as us flawed individuals can have. but you are better than you were at the start, and you are ready for the next person, the next partner. 
&gt;
&gt;Good luck!

I was born in San Diego

I had a pretty normal elementary school situation, I was smart, things went well but not exceptional. I did however make the notable decision at the age of 12 to skip going to my local junior high and instead get on a bus at 6:30am to get sent off across town to a much better school in a terrible neighborhood with a computers program. This is also important.

At any rate, I was informed that my family and I would be moving to Denver not long after the upcoming Christmas. This was not news that I welcomed. I'd had a few girlfriends by this point (five during my freshman year alone, so I had a pretty active social life), and was enjoying playing in my awful garage band. Because I was young and 6 months was a long time, I generally just played this up to my advantage to get free stuff from my male friends and attention from my female friends.

That is, and I stayed over with a friend and rode the bus with him to school (I'd chosen to attend far-away high school as well). 

Then my life changed forever

My friend introduced me to a girl that week who would eventually impact my life in some big ways. I won't give a ton of story for this part though because it's not super relevant except:

* We started dating with exactly 30 days to go before I moved away, which wasn't the kind of emotional shit I really needed to handle at that moment in time.
* She was my first semi-sexual partner (I've never known how to classify this
* She broke up with me the day after Valentines Day after I'd moved because she'd already kissed some other boy. We'd of course written awful poetry to each other, had plans for children, what our jobs would be, where we'd live, etc. by this point and that's how our relationship ended, that time.
* We remained in this unhealthy non-friends, even while we both were relatively involved with other people. Unsurprisingly at this point, this is also important.

My move to Colorado was tough but ultimately I found many new friends (even if we were the weirdos who looked like Robert Smith and Morrissey), and many girls, including the amazing one who'd become my wife. She was a friend of the girl I was dating at the time. She said something to someone about my girlfriend having a ""vaginal wrench"" on me, and that she'd vowed to have me by the end of the year. She had me within two weeks.

You see, I pretty much always wanted to be around them and as I got older I pretty much always wanted to be inside them. And the two I slept with by the time I was 17 obliged frequently and sometimes acrobatically. I often wish for my own 18-year old virility back, but I digress. Let it be made clear here that the two girls I'd slept with (as in PIV sexytimes) includes the girl who'd become my wife. While the girl she'd ""stolen"" me from and I fought constantly and had real issues with jealousy and clinginess (mostly on my part), I found that this new girl (call her K) and I didn't fight at all. We just didn't, and really still don't. We'd discuss any issues that came up an talk them through. Everything was great, we got along really, really well. Too well, which was gold for a 17-year old boy and his hot 16-year old girlfriend who wants nothing more than to fuck. She had to convince me it was time to have sex

And being moronic teenagers who believe they are invincible

Finding out about this was no picnic, she kept running to the bathroom to throw up, which has been turned out to be a clear sign that my wife is pregnant ever since.

I'd started art school by this point, she worked at Target, and we lived together at her mothers house for about a year and a half. 

I eventually got a good job in my field that paid me a salary, which I think was a really smart decision, because we didn't want to rush into a marriage and eventually feel obligated to each other in more ways than our son if a relationship between us didn't work out. It was a good move, I think, even if it did confuse my son when he was old enough to do the math between our number of years married and his age. (""Wait, but I'm 13. That means you've been married 13 years, right?"" ""Uh

We had a young and growing family, the economy tanked, I supported us on freelance and unemployment. While I worked for one particular shitty company, we had our second child when our oldest was three despite the fact that my employer never paid my insurance premiums, unbeknownst to us, and so our baby's delivery and my wife's pre-natal care were not covered. This led to terrible debt issues, which led to us paying rent late regularly. We needed co-signers for car loans, and through it all, we didn't have health insurance for his hospitalization and incurred a $38, too.

Having received her GED

You see, as the above paragraph might lead you to expect:

* Since we had been together since we were essentially children and hadn't had much time to mature independently
* We just always had to deal with lots of money problems
* We developed trust issues, from California. The one I'd had unhealthy and bone-headed obsessions with for years and years. That one.
* We had two children under 5 who were incredibly spirited did not particularly get along
* We dealt with sleep deprivation, anxiety, passive aggressiveness, codependency.
* On top of all of this

Pretty clearly here

Shit that in a fucked up way saved my marriage.

See, despite my wife insisting this woman still had a thing for me, the woman I'd been convinced at one point I was going to marry had I not ""been trapped by my wife and kids into this life"". 

This woman was getting married soon, we employed secret email accounts, all-day IMing while we were at work, all- night phone calls while my wife was at work... It was bad. 

The only way I can describe living with myself while behaving this way is: compartmentalization. I could alternatively turn on and off the self devoted to my wife and family and the self devoted to my affair. I could post all day about this and I bet it's where most of my questions come from. Some points from above that played into this behavior besides a complete lack of love for myself

* I had a soft-spot in my heart for my hometown San Diego (still do) and she was a connection back to a time I saw as before my life fell apart. Before I'd been moved against my will
* The affair took place exactly 10 years after our initial whirlwind Christmastime fling in high school and somehow that made it seem just as poetic or justified or meant to be or something equally self-serving and disgusting. It was easy to slip back into that ill-fated
* I had spent a lot of time missing that 16-year old I fell in love with and got pregnant while simultaneously resenting the 23-year old stressed out wife and mother she'd become. At my hands
* I was not capable of communicating my needs to my wife because I didn't feel she was capable of hearing them, for instance), we'd cool it off by reminding ourselves that we were the ""fun ones"".

The sequence of events for Christmas 2004 was:

* Early Christmas morning - my wife leaves town to visit her sister on a pre-planned trip
* Christmas evening - I take my kids to Denny's for dinner and get incredibly depressed and thoughtful about  what I was about to do
* Day after Christmas - I take my kids to my parents' house and drive directly to the airport
* The next 24 hours - proceed to take this emotional affair into the physical realm.
* Evening of December 27 - send my mistress home
* New Year's Eve - pick up my wife from her trip

What you need to understand is: my wife is truly amazing. It's at this point in the story, to be sure, but she didn't throw me out. She said she wasn't done with me yet. She came close to being done with me many, many times, but she never did. This can be attributed to about 12 million things, but mostly:

* Seriously
* Lots of therapy
* Lots of therapy
* Appropriately-medicated mental health
* I worked my ass off to prove to her just how re-devoted I was to us. I wasn't great at first but I got the hang of it.

We worked on ourselves a lot over the next few years, we yelled a lot, we fucked a lot (we've always done that though). Once when things were back on a good track, I mentioned once how much I regretted doing what I'd done, and my wife said ""I don't, if you hadn't had an affair, we wouldn't have been forced to look at ourselves and fix things. Your affair saved our marriage."" And while I agree

And here we are. Our son is 14 and in high school himself. Our daughter is 11 and in middle school. We have a 4-year old who is incredible. My mother in law has moved out, one of the best at her work. She still works five nights a week but that isn't a problem in the slightest because of how we treat each other the rest of the time. We make well into the 6 figures and can provide things for our children and ourselves we never even dreamed of. I've been to New Zealand, New York, Iceland, Hungary, Ireland, Amsterdam and more for work and travel has always been something I love and without my wife's support and love I wouldn't have been able to accomplish half of what I have. I had to realize it's because of them that my life is great, I'm proof that things can work out

Anyway

1338341878.0,ubde8,5 Relationship advice to girls from that always single friend who listens to all your problems. ,thegreenclocktower,75,20,17,"*Warning: downvote me all you want because this may be the ugly truth to many girls out there. I love my friends but they don't listen to me

Advice #1: Lower your expectations to 0. I'm **not** saying ""set them down to accept douche bags"". But ladies, have *realistic* standards. If you already have a partner, and want him to do something nice, to take you on a romantic date, buy you flowers and whatnot *tell* him. Men don't read minds or hints - subtle or not.

Advice #2: Whenever he/she does something you don't like (yes, do it. I know you might be afraid that you'll cause conflict, or seem ""clingy"" but trust me, it's better than shoving all that anger in the back of the closet and out of no where *SNAP*. SO COMMUNICATE GODDAMMIT.

Advice #3: Do **not** control your partner. Let him/her go out with his/her friends, *they would BE* with someone else. But they ain't, so trust them and sit the fuck down). Give him/her some space. Let him/her eat and wear what he/she wants, and do whatever he/she wants (as long as it's not harmful). He/she may love you but his/her life *does not orbit only around you*. Do not make *your needs* to come **always** first, and do not make your partner *responsible for your lifetime happiness*. That is a *big* responsibly, that I'm still not sure if you should put it entirely in someone else's hands.

Advice #4: Your pussy should not be put on a pedestal. Just because you have a nice ass

Advice #5: Relax. Be nice. Even after years of dating, overreact and lose your shit (easier said than done). Sit down and talk, don't yell. Take a fucking joke. Have a fucking sense of humor. Look more at what you *do have* rather than complaining and whining about what you *don't have*. And learn how to not give a fuck about what others think of you, your partner and your relationship. Want to go back to your ex? Do it. Want to go out dancing and grind on him all night long? Go ahead. Want to wear a short skirt on girls night out? Can't see why the fuck not. Prefer not to go out on Valentine's Day and instead rent movies and watch it in a fort in the middle of the living room? By ALL means. Irrelevant opinions from irrelevant people are also irrelevant in your life.

That's all I've got.

Love

That single friend - who finally got out of the forever alone island and is in the happiest relationship of her life.

1349296454.0,10w7z0,My relationship CHaRT,mkglass,70,18,24,"Hi.  I am 45[m], and an ability to empathize have left me with some ideas about what makes for a good relationship.  I'd like to share them with you.  Please feel free to criticize

---

I have come to realize that there are 4 things that form the foundation of a good relationship:

* Communication
* Honesty
* Respect
* Trust

You may wonder why some things are not there.  Love, my philosophy applies to *all* good relationships, not just romantic ones.  Do you have a good relationship with your boss?  Then you probably have all four qualities.  A bad one?  Then you are probably missing all four.

Second, and is a more esoteric concept.  It really is outside the scope of this discussion.

Besides... I call this the relationship CHaRT

So... what do these things mean?  Perhaps something a little different for each person

* **Communication**

Talk to each other.  Duh.  But it's more than that.  Don't just talk AT each other.  Communication is so much more... a touch of the hand on your partner's arm (not recommended with most bosses, *listening* to each other.  These are all facets of communication.  Give feedback, and positive reinforcement.  She's not going to be open to communication with you if you tell her ""that's a stupid idea.""

It's not a debate, and see if there is a way to compromise that you can both agree on.  Be honest but polite and respectful (interesting how this ties in to the other concepts, eh?).

* **Honesty** 

This is very important, I am not saying that you have to tell her that ""yes, that dress DOES make your butt look big!""  But if you want to have the sort of relationship that you envy in others, where they both seem to have their own little secrets that nobody else knows, then you truly have to be honest with each other.  Don't hide your smoking.  Don't lie about where you were when you come home late.  

So... guys.  She cooks dinner for you and asks you how it was, but they are not respectful.  You have to follow all of the ""rules.""  More on that in a moment.  

Perhaps you could be honest in a nice way.  Tell her that you are so blessed to have a wife who wants to cook for you.  Perhaps next time she could use a little less salt?  Honesty is important

* **Respect**

Ok, did you!  In fact, you're a little drunk, and it's an hour past when you said you'd be home.  At the very least, call him and let him know when you'll be home, and that you're ok.  He may not admit it in his manly way, but he's worried about you

Respect covers a lot of ground.  It's about boundaries.  Her things.  His feelings.  This person you are with has their own likes and dislikes, only to end up in a big fight?  If you know she's sensitive about the extra hair on her lip, then why would you make fun of her for it?  

Respect her feelings, and when it's not.

* **Trust**

If I'm going to use simile, and respect are all needed in order to build up trust in a relationship.  Break even one of these, and it's difficult to mend that trust.  Once a leg of a stool has been broken, would you sit on it again?  Of course not... you'd be afraid it would give out underneath you.

Do you trust your man to make a business trip to Vegas without seeing a stripper?  Do you care if he does?  If you're okay with it, then that trust was broken because he didn't respect you, didn't communicate with you, and lied.



If one of these tenets is broken, then I can almost guarantee that one or all of these have been violated to some extent.

I have answered a few posts here on reddit

Do you feel the same way?  Do you have a story that supports or detracts from these ideas?  Please share.  And thanks for reading.

When you are being friendly with a person of the desired/opposite sex there is always the possibility that one of you starts to feel romantically or physically attracted to the other. If you are the one

The friendship is also important to you and you don't want to destroy it by telling her that you like her more and make it all awkward. Maybe something in the lines of ""I'll wait, every touching, every gentle laughter, every smile and use it to make up your dream-relationship. At some point you have made up such a perfect relationship that there's no going back for you. It has to be her. ""It's the way it's supposed to be"" you might think.

If you now tell her and she outright rejects you a la ""never gonna happen""

**What you instead need to do is tell her right when you're sure something is changing about your feelings towards her.**

""She will probably say no"" is no reason not to tell her if you like her. Show some confidence. You have a right to feel that way and she should know.

It will take a lot of courage. In my case, messaged a lot, talked about private stuff, etc. At some point we ended up sleeping in the same bed when I realized I might want more than friendship.

Don't you dare telling her over Facebook, anything that seems normal (not date-like). It is important that no one is sitting next to you of course so that you can talk openly. It especially crucial to make sure that no one you know might bump into you. If you are at a public place, wait until you got your coffes or whatever. Make sure you will not be disturbed. This conversation will be very important, if not the most important in your relationship.

Look her in the eyes and then tell her that you started to feel differently about her. She will recognize your honesty and that it took you a lot of courage to tell her. Girls appreciate both! Ask her how she feels about it. 

She has generally three possibilities: 1) Not gonna happen

- The important part is that regardless of her response you will not have to ride an emotional roller-coaster for the next days/weeks because you're not madlessly in love with her (yet). 
- If she rejects you
- You just gave her a big compliment. Girls like compliments.
- Now that she knows she can behave accordingly and also try to not make it uncomfortable for you (by hugging you all the time

Maybe tell her how you also value your current friendship and don't want to jeopardize it by ""wanting more from it"" if she cannot feel the same right now. Then talk about how you are going to handle the situation. She has to help you with that one

TL;DR: Tell her immediately. There is no reason not to. It pays off in any case.

1349642886.0,113pr3,A few things I've observed from my relationships and others',neddit7,58,11,26,"This may help you if you are new to dating or even experienced:

**1.** Confessing your love for eachother- it's really important that you wait for a while before you do this in a relationship. If you confess love for somebody before you even start a relationship with them

**2.**- fantasy bonds- I read up on this a while ago

**3.**- communicate- (just putting this in here :P) don't be afraid to talk to your partner. When you're with eachother and not speaking, think of something to talk about, and let it out!

**4.**- let things off of your chest- if you feel that there is something wrong

**5.**- girls do need their space- if you have the ability so spend every living second with your girl, it just wouldn't be the same after a while. But not in a way that you only see her once in a while, if she starts to seem less interested, take a day or two and give her some space to talk to friends or do her own thing.

**6.** guys make lots of sacrifice for their relationship- men tend to put off things, etc. for their women. It can really hurt a guy when they do all of that work just to see their girl who seems totally disinterested/occupied by others completely. Your man may seem like a stoic barbaric warrior, but a man who is commited to his relationship may have a ticking timebomb of a clusterfuck of emotions going on inside of him.

&gt;ARE YOU WITH THE RIGHT PARTNER?

&gt;During a seminar

&gt;The author then noticed that there was a large man sitting next to her so he said

&gt;Here's the answer.

&gt;Every relationship has a cycle… In the beginning; you fall in love with your partner. You anticipate their calls, it was a completely natural and spontaneous experience. You didn't have to DO anything. That's why it's called ""falling"" in love.

&gt;People in love sometimes say

&gt;Falling in love is a passive and spontaneous experience. But after a few months or years of being together

&gt;Slowly but surely, and your spouse's idiosyncrasies, instead of being cute, drive you nuts. The symptoms of this stage vary with every relationship; you will notice a dramatic difference between the initial stage when you were in love and a much duller or even angry subsequent stage.

&gt;At this point, you may begin to desire that experience with someone else. This is when relationships breakdown.

&gt;The key to succeeding in a relationship is not finding the right person; it's learning to love the person you found.

&gt;People blame their partners for their unhappiness and look outside for fulfillment. Extramarital fulfillment comes in all shapes and sizes.

&gt;Infidelity is the most common. But sometimes people turn to work, excessive TV, or abusive substances. But the answer to this dilemma does NOT lie outside your relationship. It lies within it.

&gt;I'm not saying that you couldn't fall in love with someone else. You could. And TEMPORARILY you'd feel better. But you'd be in the same situation a few years later.

&gt;Because (listen carefully to this):

&gt;***The key to succeeding in a Relationship is not finding the right person; it's learning to love the Person you found.***

&gt;SUSTAINING love is not a passive or spontaneous experience. You have to work on it day in and day out. It takes time, it demands WISDOM. You have to know WHAT TO DO to make it work. Make no mistake about it.

&gt;Love is NOT a mystery. There are specific things you can do (with or without your partner), the results are predictable.

&gt;Love is therefore a ""decision"". Not just a feeling.

- Having a wedding date
- Having a wedding ceremony at all (don't let the anxiety or cost of a big event put you off

What getting engaged DOES require: 

- The decisive and unambivalent promise that you will marry this person. 
- That this decision is based on the fact that your personalities and goals are compatible enough to ride the waves of what the future brings.  For some people, to have enough knowledge to make this decision.
- To start living your life as if this other person will be a part of it as long as it continues.

It breaks my heart to read, to a time of difficult decisions.   And that this person finds he/she needs to use what are, in my opinion, flimsy excuses to postpone these decisions.  I also have sympathy for the person who feels he/she has to make the ultimatum.  I can only imagine the humiliation involved in an attempt to force your SO to think of you as an adequate mate.  And then to have to wait for that person to say you are OK-enough or put conditions on that decision?  Just awful.

If you avoid things in life because you are too scared of getting hurt, how can you ever be truly happy? To be happy, you must be fearless, and to be fearless

We have gone through a lot in our relationship.    
We've gone through dealing with death of a loved one, denial and other issues. We have problems with our family life, my family won't speak to me and his parents take their stress out on us. We've had to deal with him going to high school while I was at college. We had to adjust to living with each other at such a young age. We both work 2 jobs while going to school full time. We still have financial problems. We go through other relationship related issues and its not always easy.

But you know what?



We are getting through these things. We are happy together and in love. We support each other every day. He is the love of my life

I have a list of things that I think are the most important thing in any relationship. I hope they help you(:

* Communicate with your partner. This is the most vital thing for any relationship. Also remember that effective communicating means talking openly to your partner and your partner truly listening.

*   Kiss your partner every day. A nice


*  Make sure your partner knows that you love and appreciate them. Its easy to resent someone who doesn't appreciate you.
 



*  Try to go out on dates and spend quality one on one time with your partner. 
 



*  When you argue or discuss things make sure to not use the words ""always"" or ""never"". Think about what you are trying to communicate to your partner before you speak. 
 



*  Again

I am looking for advice from people who cohabit or are married as I find these to be pretty much interchangeable. I will start with my own example. 

I am 30 years old and my husband just turned 29. We've been married 9 months, we do not allow hollywood/movies  to dictate what romance is. We define romance on our own terms in our relationship.

Now I don't hate porn, it's producers and directors trying to get as much new material out of the same few holes and a dick or two.  Basically over time it's starting to get really weird.  So what I do hate is what porn does to your average regular nice guy (or girl) like you and me, who is innocently been sipping on that big of fat bucket of porn Slurpee for a little too long.  It makes us weird.

Essentially we get really ahead of ourselves.  Say I'm a college sophomore and I hit it off with sorority sue down the road, thanks to my porn Slurpee, in my mind I've essentially banged this girl 45 thousand times.  In your mind you've done all the freaky shit. So here's this poor girl who innocently enough was hoping you would make sweet love to her when instead after the third round of sex you're explaining bukake and where to tie what to where for the water melon dildo.

So how what I'm trying to say is getting too comfortable with porn

So what I'm saying is having such a porno-centric view of sex is very toxic in new relationships.  So stop it

This leads me to my next point on how after porn I started having better sex.  Porn is like one big pedestal for sex.  Especially for those who aren't getting any.  It is worshiped as the ultimate; all means are justified as long as the end is sex.  It doesn't matter

This went on for a day or two and no shit I challenge anyone to try this and see if they don't get the same reaction.  Literally after a couple days of me playing down the sex she was literally begging for it.  In three days she went from being annoyed that I was pestering her for sex, she is straight jumping my bones like amazon jungle woman.

So finally when we do have sex I cut the shit and stopped trying to be my own porn star and even more important I stop trying to make her a porn star by telling her how to sit or lay or how her back should be arched whatever that is all for the camera angles anyway


TL;DR
So that's it that's how porn fucked me up and turned me into an asshole so once I cut that out I was finally able to enjoy real sex with the woman i love and its only getting more and more awesome.",,t5_2sa5c,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/10i1d3/porn_was_making_me_an_ass_hole_and_how_i_learned/
1335472427.0,su4h5,Last night was good enough that I wanted to share a success story with you fine people.  ,,42,5,5,"Hello Reddit.  I(**31M**) am writing today about time spent communicating with my partner(**23F**) last night while she was taking a bath.  

**Background**:   Met at a party and became (healthily) inseparable.  We have been spending time together for about a year, we’re both hot for each other physically--and our histories growing up, while very different as events contrasted on timelines, share poignant similarities in other ways.    

**So**: frequency of sex had begun to slacken in the past couple of weeks.  As of last night it had been about eight days without direct intercourse, she'll be there to greet me.  

While communicating previously, she has a history of her sexual desire waxing and waning on a semi-unpredictable schedule.  

By contrast, enthusiastically energetic fucking that leaves the sheets off the bed and the pets very confused.  

I want to be very clear: I believe her when she tells me she's not bored of me

""*Do I not excite her as much as I used to?*""
""*She bought me a sex swing for my birthday and we haven't even used it yet.*”
“*Does this mean something?*”

This brings us to **last night**:  She was taking a bath and I was hanging out in the bathroom
I slumped down on the somewhat dirty, and about some stuff that I didn’t even realize had been bothering me until I decided to open the floodgates.  Instead of nourishing the anxious and paranoid thoughts I laid them out bare in front of us and, while uncomfortable at first, worked through issues with loving and direct communication.  Oh, and we had some really nifty sex.  Suffice it to say, I felt worlds different—better—and wanted to share a success story* with you folks.  

TL;DR: Don’t forget to check in with the people you love

 There is a lot of uncertainty, or just got married, every thing feels familiar, and unfamiliar at the same time. You know this person, but will they learn some thing new about you? Will it be a deal breaker? WHAT ARE THEY THINKING?! The good news is that there is no guess work to it. There is never any reason to worry about the timing being off, having said the wrong thing, or any of that jazz.

 Occasionally you will meet the person, this person is not for you. Any missteps, or failures in their eyes are actually an opportunity to get out of a poor relationship where we are more concerned with being whom we should be than being whom we are. With the right person you are physically unable to screw it up. They value you for who you are, and not who you can be for them. Friend, lover, whatever form the relationship takes, the quality of the interaction is more important to them than its type. We have heard it a million times, just keep being your self

I have always wondered why people came to me for love advice when I was always the friend that was single. I have come to a conclusion that it's because I always think logically and analyze situations. I don't mind giving the advice. My advice is usually what you already know that you don't want to hear

This is Momma Maria's advice on relationships:

1. **FIRST LEARN TO LOVE YOURSELF AND BE HAPPY BY YOURSELF!!!** No one can love you more than you can! You don't have to love yourself to the point were you're vain about it. But if you don't love or appreciate yourself

2. **WAIT.** I know that is harder than it sounds, flaws and all. Also don't get discouraged while waiting. Do your own thing and have fun with your friends and family. Do things that you've never done or go places you've never visited before. Also as you're doing your own thing and trying these new things it opens the doors to meeting new people and learning more about yourself and the things that you like. So just try it!!!

3. **WHEN YOU MEET THE RIGHT PERSON, cause it's more of a feeling inside and it's different for every person ( that's what I believe). (I'll write more about this in a separate note.)

4. **NEVER SETTLE!!!** I know that being single can be lonely and scary sometimes

5. **WHEN YOU MEET THE RIGHT PERSON EVERYTHING WILL FALL INTO PLACE.** By this I mean when you meet that person

6. **YOU WILL FEEL HAPPY WHEN YOU MEET THE RIGHT PERSON.** If you have taken the advice and found the right person for you, but it is the truth.

7. **COMPROMISE!!!** Now I'm not saying compromise on settling for someone or being a 'push-over'. I mean if situations come up that you and your love don't agree on, don't settle for someone who is like that. You will end up hurt and miserable in the end (I personally have been there). If the person truly loves you and vice versa, then both of you will be willing to compromise and see where the other person is coming from to come up with an agreement. Compromising is also part of listening to your partner and understanding them. You both will be much happier in the end.

8. **DATE.** Yes I know this sounds kind of stupid. But you really don't know what kind of partner you want unless you date all the wrong ones first. Keep your mind open when you date and keep your options open. Don't always date the same 'type'

Ok this is all I can think of at the moment. I hope that you or someone you know takes this advice. I love to see people happy!!!",,t5_2sa5c,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/uc85c/the_advice_my_momma_gave_me_about/

1365396377.0,1bwe63,How to Break up with Someone,theangrytherapist,45,11,8,"Ending a relationship is one of the most difficult things we can do. You're going to hurt someone you care about. Many, terminating it is the responsible thing to do. The sooner the better. 

There is no “right” way to do this. But there is a healthy, responsible way.

1. Do it in person.

Listen: You’re the one who will have to carry how you ended it. Not them. All breakups are difficult

So, text, phone, and even Skype are not acceptable. Don’t be a coward. They don’t deserve that. 

It doesn’t matter if you’ve been dating this person for three weeks or three years

If you allow yourself to terminate a relationship via text, then most likely you will do it again. Stop yourself from forming this habit. Flip it and ask yourself how you'd like it if someone ended things with you this way? 

The only exception to this rule is if the other person is unstable and explosive and breaking up in person could be dangerous. 

2. Be honest.

Don’t open the “you deserve someone better” door. That’s bullshit. You entered through the front door. Leave that way. That means use “I” statements. Take responsibility by owning your feelings. Tell them how you feel and why you are ending this. This isn’t about blaming

The more you soften, fear kicks in and they can’t say the words.

3. One you've made the decision
 
Timing is something I struggle with. You probably don’t want to break up with someone on her birthday, you get my drift... But don’t use timing as a excuse to postpone. I think once you’ve made the decision and you’re sure about it, it should happen relatively quick. Of ourse, terminating a marriage involves a lot more than ending a three-week dating deal. If you’re honest with yourself, you will know when you're letting yourself drag.

4. Don’t dissect the relationship.

A breakup isn’t about why things didn’t work. If you open that can

You do have an obligation to say why but after that, knowing that ultimately it will be the least painful way to do this, even if it doesn’t feel that way in the moment. If your doctor has to re-break your wrist after you’ve just broken it to set it back into place, how fast and focused do you want him to be? That’s the mindset. 

5. Don’t let it linger.

You can’t break up with someone then ask them if they want to hang out as friends that weekend. Again, that’s on them. Give them space by distancing yourself. Many feel bad so they want to be there for them during this transition. 

Don’t. That's emotionally torturing them. They may not have the strength to push you away

6. Don’t take pictures down and change your Facebook status to ""single"" within the week.

Do I really need to expand or explain? Remember: the way you handle the breakup says a lot about who you are. Give it some time. Let it be a transition. Just because you have the “talk” doesn’t mean you’re suddenly free to go crazy. Respect the relationship. The key is to be firm enough with your decision but also sensitive to the other party. Be strong but considerate.

1344585868.0,xzkhw,Some tips I have to offer that have helped me with my marriage.,,39,6,11,"I want to start with saying I don't assume to know everything

I met my wife through one of my closest friends. His family was celebrating his father's birthday, so long as I would actually come out. So my friend calls me and says I have to come to this party, or no one else is aloud to show. I agree, and my friend continues to invite everyone else. I get there, and find out that my friend's dad is doing all the cooking, and its *his* birthday. I'm not exactly okay with that, so I offer to help. My friend's sister wonders who that is helping out with everything, be yourself and love will eventually find you.

Now for the advice portion.
The first thing we did on our very first date was talk about our preferences, hobbies, etc. I told her that I was at a point in my dating life that I was tired of BSing my way into relationships, and I'm going to be flat out with her. I explained about my anger issues, my sexual preferences, that I was a virgin, anything negative about me that I could think of. She did the same, and skipped right to the serious part because we both knew what we wanted. If you do this at the start of a relationship

One thing we do is, and get back to the issue when we are more cool-headed. When anger and frustration get in the way, you can't get anything done. Don't simply push it down though. Burying your issues, no matter how simple, is *never* healthy. Hang on to the emotions you were feeling, but don't let them get in the way. There's a medium in there somewhere, you just have to find it

If you're having issues with being a good romantic, remind yourself why you love them. Call them, text them, email them, whatever, just get a message to them that you couldn't help but think about them, and that you love them. When you're not preoccupied, think about what might make them happy. Don't think about that so simply though. Sometimes what you can do is create a small surprise that you would like to do for them

Talk about sex, or even every time for that matter. Don't let the fact that one of you didn't enjoy that particular session bother you. Sex won't always be perfect, no matter how hard you work at it, your bodies might not always be in sync. Make mental notes during sex about what the other person is doing so you can bring it up later. Explore each other's fantasies, don't let them weird you out, they're called fantasies for a reason. Don't break off a relationship just because you can't fulfill a fantasy, many of us never have the pleasure of doing so

When your SO hurts your feelings, and what they might be able to do to avoid hurting you again like that. On the other side of that: listen! Listen to your partner, put yourself in their shoes. You're doomed to failure if you can't get yourself to understand the way your SO feels about something, especially when it comes to the way you treat them.

To all the kids reading this, and they were *very* happily married up until that moment. It does happen, just not as often as one would like to think. Don't let your age be the reason you make a decision about your relationship, love knows no boundaries, and can find a home in the hearts of those who least expect it. Don't mistake this for changes happening in your life, these are factors you have to weigh in to a relationship. Your life may not always be accommodating to the current relationship you're in, and sometimes you have to base your decisions around that fact.

Most of all, but that is a mistake that is all too easy to make. So many people in this world get stereotyped by their friends, they're taste in music, they're hobbies, and none of that really applies to who they are. You might be considered a ""prep"" with your abercrombie shirts, and your pre-worn jeans, but that doesn't mean you don't go to metal concerts, go up to them and start chatting. You would be surprised that the person with the tattoos and piercings actually turn out to be intellectually

I used to bring my problems with me everywhere I went. I never got a break. Once my husband and I agreed to disagree for the sake of having a good time

So if you are in a fight over something petty, just fake it. Don't be the bickering couple. Don't get wasted and decide to ""work it out"" in the middle of Scrabble night with your neighbors.

Don't say ""Ugh, there John goes again, drinking too much whiskey. Just put down the bottle, John

I can't tell you how many times my coupled friends have decided to act out like this in front of me. They think it is normal. They think it is ""just what people do."" No, just don't do it in front of ALL of your friends while your SO is there. ",,False,,t5_2sa5c,False,,

I'm typing this for two reasons:
* to structure my thoughts
* to help others

I've spent the last 4 years in an on/off-relationship with a girl

Kate's main drive in life is a family: she'll do everything to have children and find a great father for them. My main drive in life is creative expression: I am a maker

She's also very, on the other hand, am a thinker who enjoys debating. We often had intense discussions about nothing significant, because we are so different.

This lead to me being frustrated and breaking up with her

Now I realize how we got along: she gave me a sense of direction and strength. All I had to do was follow her and tag along, I kept on doing it, because I got so accustomed to her presence that I couldn't imagine not living with her.

She, as well as keep me tied to her. She made me feel guilty for not being there for her, or for spending too much time on my own. I never saw it like this until recently, and I'm sure she's unaware of her doing it. She just goes forward, and needs her man to be there for her.

Throughout the years I repeatedly asked her why she's with ME, I realized that she doesn't care how her man is, as long as he is there for her and her children.

That's not love. When you love someone, along with the fact that I kept on feeling more and more insecure the more I stayed with her, made me see everything clearly.

Her overwhelming desire for security and family made her choose any man who fit the criteria

Remember who you are, and work with their personalities instead of trying to shape them.

1364158580.0,1axkwd,Realizing this little difference gave me far better relationships. (F32),sleepykity,37,8,8,"**Wall of text alert

Hello to all! I wanted to share a little tidbit that made a huge difference in my relationships. (this is my very first post

It came from a rather unlikely source, so it came as a surprise to me!). I read it some years ago and in there the author (John Gray)  describes one small difference between male and female understanding: When a woman starts to talk about what is bothering her, she basically goes into a stream of consciousness of stimuli, reactions, feelings, associated thoughts etc etc with the main goal to feel *understood* (and, quite often, on the other hand

And here it's where it gets tricky: this is quite often interpreted by women as not understanding or, in turn, have no idea what happened, since in their eyes, they did the most loving thing they could possibly do. Obviously, miscommunication ensues (I only have to think at all the rage comics that depict such cases. major fuuuu there). However, when it comes down to it: both sides have said and done the same thing

So this is the theory, needs etc etc - of course it is so. However when I read it, I was like ""Damn..It's true..I do tend to go into long-winded monologs about my feelings and I mostly do that in order to be understood or even for me to understand what I feel...And I also hate it when I hear dry pieces of advice when I have JUST OPENED MY HEART AND SOUL HERE, GOD DAMN IT, HUG ME NOW!!!"". 

So I set out to test the theory. I took the responsibility to limit my long winded monologs either to my girlfriends (which function the same way, then I should at the very least make sure I come to a concrete conclusion what it is that I want and just tell it like it is, in concrete sentences. ""I want to just talk about it and I would like for you to listen to me."" ""I need a hug"" - whatever is the core of my problem or need at the specific moment. In short, to ""translate"" it in a manner that he understands. And instead of going off on him when he does something that I don't like, I could just say what it is that I didn't like and what I would like instead. And interestingly, since he has a very clear view of what I need, he simply does it in a manner that is good for both.

Result: fights diminished to an astonishing degree



tl;dr men and women tend to have different ""language"". Meeting each other halfway: girls

Here's the point.

I got to just sit there (make sure you go at a time when the salon is not busy)

1) She sees you as someone who is interested in her beauty regimen and not some mouth-breathing troglodyte. (I helped her pick out her color.)

2) You get to spend time with her and just talk.

3) She gets all beautiful and feels great about herself.

4) You get a back massage! (I went through the massage cycle three times!)

5) She will want to go out because that's what women want to do (at least mine does) when they get spruced up.

6) You might even get laid. (No guarantee here.)

Make sure you go to a small salon and not a big spa. Somewhere where they won't kick you out of the chair while you wait.

My problem is that I love relationships. I was in one for 8.5 years that ended a couple of years ago and before that I had quite a few good girlfriends. I'm fucking addicted to that feeling. So since I don't have time for one now (and I never really meet women anyways)

Lately, women falling out of love with men (and visa-versa), cheating, people using one another, unappreciative partners, and fights with family.

So I was thinking

I'll start - My ex (I'll call her M) used to throw me the most awesome birthday parties. We used to have a big group of 15-20 people when I first met M, she was an excellent cook, and the spread of food was ridiculous at these parties, not to mention the alcohol. She'd work on that party for weeks. Even after M broke up with me, she threw the biggest party ever for my 30th birthday. There must have been 40-50 friends from the last 2 decades of my life there. It was great. I doubt I'll ever have a birthday party that good again. Even though we were through and it had been a few months, I don't think I've ever felt as loved as I did that night.

2.    View and make initial contact with people you find attractive. (spend 1/2-1hour each evening weeding through.) Also make sure you use updated photos. If you show up to a date and you used junior year college photos but your 35 now


3.    Don't be aggressive and weird in your contact with potentials. Be honest. Be funny. Type or speak in complete


4.    Set up COFFEE DATES ONLY for initial in person contact (or tea if thats what your into.) This is way faster


5.    Do the coffee dates on thursday or friday evening so you still have one free weekend night.
6.    Groom yourself and pick out a classy/appropriate outfit well before your date. All necessary body-scaping and cleaning should be performed. Look good. Smell good. Feel good.


7.    Approach each date with an open heart and mind. There is not just one soul mate out there for you


8.    Don't be afraid of rejection AND Don't be afraid to reject someone or say ""no thanks, but I'm just not feeling a connection."" Don't string someone along because you are too chicken to be honest.


9.    Don't be afraid to date multiple people at once. As long as your honest and don't immediately declare exclusivity with someone (you shouldn't) you reserve the right to ""play the field."" By dating multiple people I don't mean being sexually active with multiple people. If you do go that route you're rolling the dice on STD's. And lord knows you don't want to go out like willy lump lump.


10.    Once you find that great guy or gal and declare you exclusivity, enjoy them. Go on cool dates. Be romantic, listen to your partner. Enjoy the experience, ride the wave where it takes you, be it a week, several months or a lifetime. You will crash and burn a few times, but its all about the experience.

- Listen.  Listen to your partner
- Give them reasonable space
- Don't give up everything else in your life for them.  Make room for them
- Simple one
- Never let pride or arrogance get in the way of your relationship.  Those traits are never worth potentially losing the one you care about.
- Be there for them and help out in anyway possible.  Hate cleaning?  Well screw that
- Never pay more attention to something other than your SO.  This gives the impression that they're not worth your time or that you're bored of them.  Be sure to really think about what you do day to day.  Be sure that they know they're loved.
- **Write** down a list, because your future self can become quite blinded.
- Take a step back when arguing with your SO.  Why are you upset?  Did you have a bad day?  Did *they* have a bad day?  Find the root and don't let yourself be consumed.  Your pride will never leave you
- Never make big decisions about your relationship without first sleeping on the idea.  This holds true for anything in life.  You don't want to say something terrible which you'll never be allowed to take back.
- Therapists and friends are there to help you.  They give you an outside perspective.  Use them!  Use them as often and as frequent as you need.  They keep a relationship together.  Never be afraid to tell someone a problem you think is going on.
- Change, give and take will occur.  Allow yourself (within reason) to change for the one you love.  If you don't then that just shows selfishness.
- If you started doing something at the beginning of the relationship for your SO
- Always give presents to them and always take them out to nice restaurants.  Show them you love them
- If there is something, FIX IT.  Don't patch it, don't pretend it doesn't exist, and don't try to have the other person change to solve that issue.  You need to fix this ASAP before it spreads and becomes more than one issue.  Therapists are again a great resource to help.

From the MANS side 30M:

Ok

The reason why I was on the site—I was looking for a random hookup. I soon found out that over 95% of the postings are bots

I still remember my girlfriend’s ad. “Looking for a SD” there was also a picture of girl with a really gorgeous body attached. I had no idea what a “SD” was, and a little confused I respond with, “What are you looking for?” She answers, “I think it’s obvious since I put “Looking for a Sugar Daddy” in the title.” I was a little mad but still curious. I asked her how much she needed and she told me, I think she said $150. I asked her to send me another picture to prove that was her in the ad. She did and we exchanged phone numbers and setup a day and time for our first date. I canceled the first date because I was WAY too nervous, but rescheduled. At the time, I thought it was a mistake rescheduling

My first date with my current GF was the first and only time I have ever met anyone from Craig’s list for anything. Because of the sketchy nature of the whole thing, but enough differences to keep us interested in each another. After the 3 hours were up we had previously agreed to go to hotel, which we did. If I didn’t feel like we so connected, I would have just left, but I really liked this girl. We had sex in the hotel room and it was typical first time sex with a girl you liked really-- awkward but yet really good. I gave her the money. We STILL feel really bad about it. We only exchanged money one more time on our second date. After that we both agreed that we would just date after that. A month later she moved in with a friend and a month after that she moved in with me. We are still together today.


From the GIRLS side 23F:

 When I met the love of my life, no one to protect me, and nowhere to go...so I stayed with him for a year after the abuse started. This is how I met the man Im lucky enough to call mine today.

I had a friend who worked in the ""entertainment"" industry that said I should look for a ""sugardaddy""...she said very sweet, and several of the other girls were taken care of financially by these men. She said to place an ad on craigslist. I was terrified...I had only been with 2 men in my entire life, the idea of having relations with someone I didnt know for money was degrading. But with an impending death threat the following week from my drug crazed husband, I placed the ad. It was sickening the things I was emailed, and I cried and cried, but felt like I had no other choice...I had no job and was in college, having the s**t beat out of me daily was wearing on me. There was one reply that wasnt disgusting and the guy looked normal, ""Tell me what you think."" I didnt know what to say, and having already been talked to by tons of disgusting men

The first time I was to meet up with this man, how red he got when I walked through the door. We talked for hours, and I was sad that this man would never see me as anything more than a girl he paid for sex. We went through with our arrangement, and I cried all the way home. We met one more time when money was exchanged, and after that he asked me on a real date. He knew my backstory, he had paid me for sex twice, I couldnt believe someone so successful and smart and wonderful actually wanted a relationship with me.

We dated secretly for 3 months while I tried to escape the hell I was living in at home. I would come to him with bruises that covered my entire back sometimes, and then once it was safe, I moved back to be with the man I love today. That was almost 4 years ago. I cant imagine a day without this man, he is incredible. My life is so different because of him...I was able to become independent, finish college, and have a great job that I love. I am happy, and I thought that was something I would never have. I thought I wouldnt make it to my 21st birthday back then...I thought I would just be another missing person in the backwoods of the southern state Im from...
Someday I will marry this man I love, and I know I will always be safe with him.

1334325100.0,s7ww7,~Repost from /r/relationships~ General Advice from things I see occuring too often on /r/relationships.,WhippedMale,33,12,18,"Look

I've seen so many posts about cheating

The order of the points:

* 1) For people being treated like crap or cheated on.
* 2) For people with no trust in their relationship.
* 3) For people thinking of cheating.
* 4) For cheaters. **(WARNING: RANT)**

Here is my general advice to all you redditors:

* If you've been in a relationship for a long period of time, we have children."" I understand your situation is tough, but there is no excuse for cheating, none! You, who is in this situation right now, get up and leave. They've mistreated you enough times that really it breaks my heart to see you get stepped on, and I don't even know you. If my girlfriend did such a thing (And she knows what I am like when it comes to cheating and the such), and I'm sure the minute you walk out that door you'll regret it and you love the person on the other end. Don't look back

* If you are in a relationship without trust

* For those thinking of cheating; don't. It's sad but the truth is, this is your fault, 100%, putting the blame on them and bringing them down is completely uncalled for.

* And finally for those cheating...I really can't say anything to you. You really need to pick up your act. If you know you're in a position that can cause you to cheat, please don't. I know it's in the moment and that person in front of you is so attractive; Call your SO, tell them what has been on your mind and break up with them. And when you do, make sure they have no way of contacting you. They will try and get you back, and it isn't worth all the stress you two will find in continuing the relationship that never was meant to be. **WARNING RANT** I find that you are the scum of the earth. Alcohol isn't an excuse, his/her physical body isn't either...I don't believe in Karma but god I hope it gets you. I hope you have the best relationship ever and you screw it up...

Sorry for the slight rant at the end...good luck...

Early on in our relationship

Over time, he would use her to get “ego boosts”. Wow, what integrity.

Fast forward in time, he became more trustworthy and my instincts were finally cooled down). Right before we move cities for a career, I inadvertently discovered he had been writing massive and dramatic emails to the same girl saying that he had made a huge mistake and he loved her, etc. I left him on the spot. I called the girl “again” in a raging frenzy- I was pissed she didn’t contact me. I really didn’t need to do that though. I told a few of my good friends our situation. They were in shock. Somewhere inside, amidst all the chaos from the events, I felt liberated. I was free. 

Over time, he made a secret Reddit account and commented on the NSFW pictures of women that shared the same origin as the girl. There are probably other things I don’t know about. I know what this looks like in writing. I have enough insight to realize that I have chosen a life of pain. But those decisions belong to me, and where I take my life next is a dialogue I can only have with myself.

Tldr: Stayed in a committed relationship after a series of serious emotional affairs. Below is a list of advice to those who can relate.

Although every relationship has its series ups and downs
I’m just speaking from experience.

So

You will begin to normalize pain/resentment in a relationship. Sure
you

Sometimes you are just better at putting those emotions in compartments and sometimes they surface back in full gear. Resentment, playing the victim all seem to inevitably resurface at varying times and in varying degrees. Time just desensitizes you of those feelings.

If some of your friends and family are aware of the situation, I was just judging myself.

You will feel shame. Beyond the anger and the tears

There’s bound to be more drama manifested in different ways. Okay, have huge emotional problems. People who try to reconcile the relationship also have emotional issues to be addressed. Either way, it takes a huge commitment to the other person and to yourself to want to really understand and resolve the driving forces behind the adultery.

It’s more work to stay.

Now that you have the background

* whenever you get the feeling that something you have said in an argument has gone too far, this is something which is often overlooked in the heat of the moment, and the importance of stopping the conversation, the screaming, the shouting, what have you, is not only so that you can admit that you have done wrong by saying something that was out of line

I reiterate that I am fully aware that this advice will seem simple and benign to most who read this subreddit. However, will lead to much healthier, and longer lasting relationships. It shows your SO that you are also viewing the argument from their perspective, which is so easy to forget to do.

We went to the same high school together. Kind of a ""knew but never actually met"" sort of thing, so often during basketball games we'd wind up in the stands together. I never had the nerve to talk to her. Girls like her don't even throw a second glance at guys like me, so I didn't even bother trying.  

*Fast forward 6 years.*

I was in college for the second time living with a close friend of mine in a small bachelor pad uptown. Seeing this girl who lived outside of the city, the girl from high school, the one with the beautiful smile, always known to me as the unattainable. We get talking at the bar, she's still with dickhead, they've been together for about 6 years and she says she's miserable, she says she wants out but doesn't know how to get out, has no trust in her

A week or so passed, I'll never forget what it said, ""Hey, it's Liz, I got your number from Keith, I just really need someone to talk to right now."" So she called me, her boyfriend the basketball player (we'll call him Chad) had just tore her apart, ugly, made her feel better

*First kiss.*

She dropped by my place after Chad had left for work, but having been with him for six years, she didn't know how it was possible to just leave. At the age of 20, six years seems like a lifetime. I gave her some advice to the best of my ability, cheered her up, and soon she was on her way. She stopped just outside the door, took me by the hand, and said ""Thank you."" I instantly remembered that smile, after all

*Chad*  

Chad was a year younger than me, arrogant jerk who would do everything in his power to see things go his way. He knew good and well that his relationship was falling apart, but the bottom line was he'd rather see her miserable with him then happy with someone else.
After high school he never really did anything with his life

*The plot thickens.*  

We've been hanging out whenever she could sneak away for about a month now. I'm falling for her, we're parked out behind the airport sitting on the hood of my jeep watching the planes land when her phone starts ringing. It's Chad, and he's freaking the fuck out. ""You told me you were at Alisha's and when I went there looking for you she said you were never there at all, so where the fuck are you Liz? huh? You worthless slut, just wait 'till I find out who you're with, FUCK, are they ever gonna be sorry."" She starts to cry, gives me a soft kiss, I explain that I won't be responsible for my actions if he lays a hand on her. She assures me that he won't
She calls me the following night, started crying, then apologized.  

*""The downward spiral.""*  

We've been meeting up secretly for a for about three months now. It's getting to be a lot harder on both of us. I miss her when we're not together, cries when she has to leave. I know I can't keep this up, it's just to hard, but I also can't just let he choke on the noose around her neck. So I stay strong, I'm her rock when she needs me to be, I'm there any time she calls, available anytime she can meet up.  

You see, and realize what your doing is killing you. I hate Chad, I hate him so much for the way he treats her, but not half as much as I hate myself for doing this to him. I know, it sounds strange, but that's the truth. I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror out of fear of catching a glimpse of the monster I had become. The stress was astounding and constant. I felt empty, like what I was doing had hollowed me out inside and the only thing that could fill the void was her. He got into the habit of calling her almost every hour on the hour just to check up on her to see where she was, who she was with

Time rolls onward, the last thing I said to her before she left was ""As long as he's part of your life I can't be, I love you, Liz. I just can't do it anymore, I'm not asking you to choose him or me, I'm the decision easy on you. If you choose to stay with him and try to make things work I'll disappear and you'll never hear from me again. It'll be like it never happened."" She couldn't even look at me, she was crying to heavily to talk, and turned to walk away. I honestly didn't expect to ever see or hear from her again

*The Climax.*  

About two weeks have passed since Liz walked out my door. I'm still reeling from the final blow when I get a phone call. I don't recognize the number, calling me every name in the book, death threats, threats on my family, anything and everything he could think of. I don't say a word, I just listen. I deserve this. I deserve to have my teeth kicked down my throat, to be beaten within an inch of my life, It was Liz

The phone calls from him become a daily thing but I won't change my number, I don't care, I'm just happy that she now has a chance to be happy, with or without me. I explain to her that she needs to get her head on straight before anything else. She needs to take some time to come to terms with everything, I won't be a rebound, not after all of this. She understands. We talk every other day on the phone and things are going well, she's healing

*The Aftermath*  

We eventually started hanging out again, and I even get a phone call from him every now and again. At this point it's been about 8 months since all this started and we've officially started to see each other. Things go amazingly, the relationship is effortless, we never fight, we barely even ever disagree, it almost seems to good to be true. I don't believe in happily ever after, I don't think it exists. Relationships are like an old car, they fall apart (A quote from my father).  

*Conclusion*  

It's been about 2 years now, that inescapable darkness that nearly consumed me, I'll carry it with me until the day I die. It changed me forever for better or worse, but for Liz, I'd do it all over again.

**The problem/observation:** The problems and most of the advice here is based around and phrased in the context of ""*what* should I do?""

* I'm feeling something I don't like
* My bf/gf did or said or does something I dislike
* Should we stay together or break up? 
* How do I start a relationship with a boy/girl?

The majority of problems expressed around these parts are variations of these questions. I'll address each of them individually

**The Gist:** I feel the *approach* to a problem is of equal importance as the solution. Very little attention is paid in regards to *HOW* someone should *think* about the problem that they are currently addressing. This type of mental engineering can be a powerful tool. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**I'm feeling something I don't like

First you need to identify whatever it is causing you to feel the way you do. 

Are you depressed? Yes. Something happened.  
Are you jealous? Yes. I can't trust my SO.  

Next

Two favorite tests of mine:

1) Is there an actual event that exists in *reality* beyond your personal perception or interpretation to validate your feelings.

* You were dumped. 
* You were lied to. 
* Someone said you were ugly.

2) Does the problem and consequence exist entirely in your mind?

ex: I can't talk to that girl I don't know because (I'm uncomfortable

You COULD go talk to her. And as long as you don't provoke physical violence (unlikely)

**Your feelings are rational:**

If you prove to yourself that what you're feeling is rational. There is a ""thing"" or person you can address directly that you've already identified. Gather your patience and understanding. Confront. 

(If you were dumped


**Your feelings are irrational:**

Feels bad to be here. Basically

&gt; I can fix these poisonous thoughts myself and they don't really affect my life/happiness. 

Work on yourself. Keep living your life. It's unlikely you're reading this.

&gt; I can't fix these poisonous thoughts myself

Casually ask friends to keep an eye out or accept it as a ""quirk.""

&gt; I can fix these poisonous thoughts myself

Seriously spend time on yourself. Force yourself and your mind to accept reality and reject your old way of thinking. Your mind is capable of some impressive agility once you've trained it. Having friends involved always helps. 

&gt; I can't fix these poisonous thoughts myself and they affect my life/happiness.

Gather your entire support structure around you. Seriously consider therapy or counseling.

I can't count how many times i read posts about how girlfriends and wives are ""FED UP"" with their boyfriend/husband's video gaming. You often see ""addiction"" and ""Habit"" in the titles of the posts. Your initial reaction is to think they don't care anymore

 * The first tip any gamer boyfriend will give you is ""play with me"". DO IT! Try it, it never hurts to give it a shot. 

 * Know what he is talking about when he is telling you about his game. They genuinely want to have a conversation with you about something they like and it helps if you chime in once in a while, Farming, ect. 

 * You need to set boundaries
If he is anything like any gamer i have dated

 * Be upfront with your feelings! Men and woman are obviously different in the ""feeling and emotions department"" My current boyfriend is pretty black and white when it comes to feelings

 * Compromise. As my boyfriend says ""He has been playing games his whole life so it has grown to have sentimental value and girlfriends don't understand that""  He is also playing Diablo3, and sometimes Wednesday he has the night alone to play his game and we skype together while he does so. This way we can still talk and he can play at the same time. We both essentially get what we want. Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday we spend together. That doesn't mean he doesn't play his game at night. BUT we spend our days together doing things like, going out to eat or watching a movie and then at night i don't feel so neglected from our time together because we spent most of the day together! A good way to preface this is ""Hey we could go do something today and later you can play your game while i do this.""
You cant expect him to drop his games all together, then you aren't cut out for this. 

 "" Do something you love, i usually don't notice he is gaming. 

I hope these tips helped out a fellow Gamer Girlfriend. The key is compromise between the 2 of you. He compromises by cutting his gaming to certains day of the week or certain times of the day so you guys are both happy. It CAN work if you make it work :)

Marriage.

“When I got home that night as my wife served dinner

Suddenly I didn’t know how to open my mouth. But I had to let her know what I was thinking. I want a divorce. I raised the topic calmly. She didn’t seem to be annoyed by my words

I avoided her question. This made her angry. She threw away the chopsticks and shouted at me

With a deep sense of guilt, and 30% stake of my company. She glanced at it and then tore it into pieces. The woman who had spent ten years of her life with me had become a stranger. I felt sorry for her wasted time, resources and energy but I could not take back what I had said for I loved Jane so dearly. Finally she cried loudly in front of me, which was what I had expected to see. To me her cry was actually a kind of release. The idea of divorce which had obsessed me for several weeks seemed to be firmer and clearer now. 

The next day

In the morning she presented her divorce conditions: she didn’t want anything from me

This was agreeable to me. But she had something more

I told Jane about my wife’s divorce conditions. . She laughed loudly and thought it was absurd. No matter what tricks she applies

My wife and I hadn’t had any body contact since my divorce intention was explicitly expressed. So when I carried her out on the first day, then to the door, I walked over ten meters with her in my arms. She closed her eyes and said softly; don’t tell our son about the divorce. I nodded, feeling somewhat upset. I put her down outside the door. She went to wait for the bus to work. I drove alone to the office. 

On the second day

On the fourth day, I realized that our sense of intimacy was growing again. I didn’t tell Jane about this. It became easier to carry her as the month slipped by. Perhaps the everyday workout made me stronger. 

She was choosing what to wear one morning. She tried on quite a few dresses but could not find a suitable one. Then she sighed

Suddenly it hit me… she had buried so much pain and bitterness in her heart. Subconsciously I reached out and touched her head. 

Our son came in at the moment and said, seeing his father carrying his mother out had become an essential part of his life. My wife gestured to our son to come closer and hugged him tightly. I turned my face away because I was afraid I might change my mind at this last minute. I then held her in my arms, walking from the bedroom, through the sitting room, to the hallway. Her hand surrounded my neck softly and naturally. I held her body tightly; it was just like our wedding day. 

But her much lighter weight made me sad. On the last day, Sorry, Jane, I do not want the divorce anymore. 

She looked at me, Jane, I said, I won’t divorce. My marriage life was boring probably because she and I didn’t value the details of our lives, not because we didn’t love each other anymore. Now I realize that since I carried her into my home on our wedding day I am supposed to hold her until death do us apart. Jane seemed to suddenly wake up. She gave me a loud slap and then slammed the door and burst into tears. I walked downstairs and drove away. At the floral shop on the way, I ordered a bouquet of flowers for my wife. The salesgirl asked me what to write on the card. I smiled and wrote, I’ll carry you out every morning until death do us apart. 

That evening I arrived home, I run up stairs, only to find my wife in the bed - dead. My wife had been fighting CANCER for months and I was so busy with Jane to even notice. She knew that she would die soon and she wanted to save me from the whatever negative reaction from our son, in case we push through with the divorce.— At least, in the eyes of our son—- I’m a loving husband…. 

The small details of your lives are what really matter in a relationship. It is not the mansion, the money in the bank. These create an environment conducive for happiness but cannot give happiness in themselves.

So find time to be your spouse’s friend and do those little things for each other that build intimacy. Do have a real happy marriage!

1371557845.0,1gkw0v,Communication is talked about a lot. Can we have an elaborate discussion about everything it should include?,LDRLDRLDR12,22,3,14,"Communication is always one of the most important requirements for a happy relationship. Maybe it's *the* most important. It ranks on top for me too. 

Communication to me is expressing one self at the initial stages of any issue creeping up or sensing to creep up. At times we keep things to ourselves. And later it explodes into something massive. Often leads to arguments/fights etc. 

I learned this myself recently. I used to be more affectionate one in my relationship. While she was the more quiet one. It bothered me a lot. And I started assuming that things would be okay after a while. But it didn't. I spent endless hours being bothered. I spent sleepless nights over it. And then I finally gave away. Told her what was bothering me. Turned out that she was just inexperienced with relationships and had no idea I liked getting her calls/texts randomly throughout the day. I laughed at myself later on how stupid I was to have not communicated it early on. It would have saved me a lot of sleepless nights and happy moments. 

So

Sometimes the other person isn't very communicative at all. They may love you more than you can even imagine. But no matter what the other person might not understand the power of communication. Or maybe they would need a few months or years of maturity to get to that level. What do you do then? How as a partner in the relationship can you help such a person to learn the art of communication?

My SO falls under this above category. She is a very good learner. The only thing I am bothered about is how do I as a partner help her out. I don't want to force it on her. Nor do I want to act any pushy.

8. Look at everything you hear with an open-minded type of examination. Be open-minded enough to consider it without prejudice and be analytical enough to research and test the validity and integrity.

I have read many books on relationships and the interactions between men and women--secular, geared toward men, toward women, toward marriage, toward dating--and this is by far the most insightful one. 

The book describes the way in which men and women are fundamentally different based on evolved physiological traits and socialization. Women are primarily fear-driven (fear of isolation &amp; loss) while men are primarily shame-driven (shame due to inadequacy). Here is a typical scenario:

Woman: If you did ______, more loved).

Man: If I do ______ just because you tell me to

Woman: If you do _____ but feel *that* way, unsatisfied). If you *really* loved me, you would *want* to do _____.

Man: If you *really* love me

Woman: Now I feel (anxious

Man: You have no right (reason) to feel that way. (Now I feel truly inadequate because whether or not I do _____ you will be unhappy).

Woman: You have no right to tell me not to feel that way. (Now I feel truly afraid because I think you don't love me).

This book explains how to break the pattern of anxiety-driven shaming of women to men

I have certainly felt anxiety dictating my thoughts. ""We haven't been spending as much time together. Our conversations aren't as long or in-depth. Is something wrong? I feel disconnected. I need him to spend more time with me or talk to me more.""

Meanwhile, so I'm doing my duty to the relationship. It's nice having her here.""

So when I brought it up, he still felt inadequate and apologized, ""for having disappointed"" me. Then he assured me I was 'overthinking'. 

I didn't want him to think if himself as a disappointment and he didn't want to minimize my fears

I love that she stays home, and I'm not entirely convinced that she's doing anything of significant benefit for our kids.  I have put a lot of thought into this, and I hope this doesn't come across as me trying to make my wife into some June Cleaver fantasy.

She is the one that feels the financial stress.  She is the one that is concerned that we ""don't make enough money.""  I am confident that whatever happens, we have cable, and we eat at restaurants 3-5 times a month FFS!  My point being that there is plenty of room in our budget to cut things, but every time I point that out, she is unreceptive because it generally means that she has to do without something that she likes or she has to do more work around the house, i.e. not eating out means cooking/dishes.

So, then I miss out spending time with my family which is the most important thing to me.  In fact, my dream is to live a life where we don't need money because we grow our own food and make whatever we need and spend all of our time together.  However, I'm not married to my dream, I'm married to my wife, and it's important to me that she be happy.  Her unhappiness seems to be connected to financial issues that we're not seeing eye-to-eye about.  Each time that I begin to raise these issues with her, she takes it very personally and nothing changes.  I am asking her to change the way she sees things pretty radically, and I want us to line back up with each other.

Tip 1: dress up. First of all

Tip 2: Cologne. I love to wear cologne. I don't wear it every day

Tip 3: Unless she says otherwise

Tip 4: Have your own way to and from the date. If you don't have a vehicle for some reason

Tip 5: Don't drink too much. Drink, if you are sober you can make sure she gets home safe and sound.

Tip 6: Talk about her. The game of the conversation is to have HER talking more than you. Not that you should be silent

Tip 7: Look deep into her eyes. Women love it when you look right into their eyes while they talk or while you talk. Sometimes it's difficult at first because sometimes a woman's eyes can be amazing, she WANTS you to look at her chest, but the more you look into her eyes, the more she is going to melt.

Tip 8: Go in with no expectations. If you are like me and do the internet dating, dont. Too many times I have been disapointed by the person I saw because they didn't look like their picture, didn't act like the person I had chatted with perviously or a combination of both. Every so often, everything goes well, but go into the situation expecting that you may not end up wanting to date this person.

Tip 9: Don't be too nice. Alright guys

Tip 10: Schedule a bathroom break. Ok , wash your face again, assuming no one else is in there, give yourself a little bit of a pep talk and walk out there with a smile on your face and a subject for her to talk about.

I come across as genuinely friendly, which typically gets me in trouble when I develop or have feelings for a particular woman, but I think my actions are just subconscious.

I tracked the guy down and he works in another very far away city

I initially asked my wife if something was going on and if she was cheating on me.  She said no and that she was only talking to some friends and that she was entitled to talk to friends. 

Then I confronted her with the pictures and she turned very apologetic

She said that the underwear picture was a mistake and that they were only playing and that she was upset at the fact that he sent that.

Hey Reddit! This might be a little long

We've been dating for about a year and a half now, and the first time we kissed I felt like jumping up and down like an idiot; even when the stupid giddy phase passed, it was still obvious to me that I loved him more than anything. Now I'm just not as sure. I can't tell if this is the comfortable phase in the relationship or if it means the relationship is dying/dead and I'm just holding on because I'm afraid to leave my comfort zone. I think I'm happier with him than I am otherwise ( and for me, that would be enough to stay) but sometimes I'm worried that I'm confusing ""comfortable/content"" with ""happy"" and that there's a difference. In terms of physical attraction, I'm still very much attracted to him, and he sure acts like he's still attracted to me; we're probably both less attracted than we were a year ago though.

The other related thing that makes me uncomfortable is how, we don't celebrate monthiversaries/anniversaries/whatever (he acknowledged the anniversary, but no fancy date or anything), and he really doesn't like PDA (I'm not a huge fan of PDA either, but I mean, if we're taking a walk by ourselves and holding hands, he'll drop my hand as soon as he sees anyone he might know. Everyone knows we're dating, PDA just makes him uncomfortable). It's not like any of this is new: it's been this way since we started dating

Last bit of information, and it was making him noticeably unhappy/grumpy. About 6 months into our relationship, he told me that he was the happiest he'd ever been. Now I and a few of our mutual friends have been noticing that he seems kind of down, compared to how he was last year. I've been chalking it up to the fact that he has more work this year and classes have been stressing him out, but my little paranoid inner voice is wondering if this is the same situation that was happening with his ex.

I haven't talked to him about my concerns because a significant part of me thinks that I'm just being crazy

I see questions in the /r/relationships community all the time asking whether or not someone should break up with their SO, communication, common interests, whatever) are all going swimmingly. But their SO has this one huge flaw that's bothering them, and they're not sure what to do about it. The question is usually something like this:

""My boyfriend goes out drinking often, but I can't get past this. Should I break up with him?""

""My girlfriend is very religious

""My boyfriend smokes marijuana, inconsiderate, and rude. Is this a dealbreaker or am I overreacting? Should I leave?""

If your SO has a huge flaw that is interfering with your enjoyment of them

**Just because someone is a really good person doesn't necessarily mean they're very good FOR YOU.** Things like religion, drug &amp; alcohol use, views on family obligations... those things can often be dealbreakers. **It's up to you whether or not they are** - no one on reddit is going to be able to advise you on that.

Haven't seen the girlfriend since she's been out of town for work on Sunday.  She comes back tonight and I'm less inclined of doing this then but I thought I'd start planning.

There's a window between Valentine's Day and our anniversary in the summer where there are no other holidays or anniversaries for her to accuse me of dumping her with ""bad timing.""  Suffice it to say her fall birthday, christmas, NYE and V-Day make 4 months of avoiding a crying, guilt trip mess.

So I've thought about using ""I"" statements

(my notes)

Reasons to break up:

Our schedules are different and hard to make a meaningful relationship work
-Going to bed on time
-Waking up on time
-Making dinner on time
-Having quality time together (not just hanging out)

I'm having problems that I haven't shared fully
-I'm addicted to the internet and it's affected my judgement and time management severely
-I haven't cleaned my apartment in months
-I don't eat well
-I rush and stress myself out and then don't have time to be healthy
-I'm a coward who fears your unhappiness and by bottling up these thoughts I've become unhealthy.  I need to be honest.

I'm no longer romantically in love with you but I do care about you
-I want you to be happy and have fun
-I want you to feel loved and desired by a partner who can take care of you and satisfy you
-I want you to feel secure in your work/social settings/relationship with a romantic partner
-I want you to feel that your partner is your teammate: they're on your side
-I can't do this for you.  I no longer feel comfortable calling myself your teammate when I have a different vision from you

I don't want to take a break.
I don't want to plan a way to fix this.
I don't want to plan a way to gradually let go.
I don't want to lie to you

I would like to be supportive of you in any non-romantic way you want but if that isn't possible then we have to let go

(Things I don't want to say)
I want to see other people
I want to have more time to myself
I don't want spend the rest of my life with you
I don't want to have children with you
I don't want to marry you


My fears:
Her crying, the promises that it'll be better and that it has been better, telling me she'll be a wreck and can't work and will lose her job, blowing up my phone and trying to ignore her, her getting angry and revealing secrets/talking shit or being destructive* somehow

Some hope:
I'm encouraged by how frequently she's been hanging out with other people without me around.  Since she's been gone we haven't talked on the phone and texted sparingly without much emotion.  She knows I want to break up with her.  

She's said in the past few months things like,"" and, ""I'm in constant fear of you breaking up with me.""  So...she knows it's coming.  We've talked about it and she's said that she's talked to other people about it, summarizing with,  ""We don't know what to do but we know it won't last.""

Another thing to note is I DO have a social life, I really feel the separation from her weighing on me.

How can I have more confidence and enjoy my life during these long distance periods?  It's really hurting my mood and enjoyment during my business trips.  How can I get over irrational suspicions and nervousness about the relationship?

Original Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/108jzz/nice_guy_symdrome_very_important_issue_for_fappers/

I'm currently reading a book about Nice Guy Symdrome. The author lists many characteristics of ""Nice Guys"" that i'd like to share with you. I used to be a ""Nice Guy"" before my NoFap challenge - i'm changing now. I think that you guys will identify yourself with many of those characteristics. One detail that the author doesn't know: ""Nice Guy Syndrom"" is TOTALLY related to fapping. I thank God and NoFap for saving me of this shit. Here we go:

Nice Guys are givers. Nice Guys frequently state that it makes them feel good to give to others. These men believe their generosity is a sign of how good they are and will make other people love and appreciate them.

Nice Guys fix and caretake. If a person has a problem, depressed or sad, Nice Guys will frequently attempt to solve or fix the situation (usually without being asked).

Nice Guys seek approval from others. A universal trait of the Nice Guy Syndrome is the seeking of validation from others. Everything a Nice Guy does or says is at some level calculated to gain someone's approval or avoid disapproval. This is especially true in their relationships with women.

Nice Guys avoid conflict. Nice Guys seek to keep their world smooth. To do this

Nice Guys believe they must hide their perceived flaws and mistakes. These men are afraid that others will get mad at them

Nice Guys seek the ""right"" way to do things. Nice Guys believe there is a key to having a happy

Nice Guys repress their feelings. Nice Guys tend to analyze rather than feel. They may see feelings as a waste of time and energy. They frequently try to keep their feelings on an even keel.

Nice Guys often try to be different from their fathers. Many Nice Guys report having unavailable, angry, philandering, or alcoholic fathers. It is not unusual for these men to make a decision at some point in their lives to try to be 180 degrees different from Dad.

Nice Guys are often more comfortable relating to women than to men. Due to their childhood conditioning, or abusive — traits they link to ""other"" men.

Nice Guys have difficulty making their needs a priority. These men often feel that it is selfish to put their needs first. They believe it is a virtue to put others' needs ahead of their own.

Nice Guys often make their partner their emotional center. Many Nice Guys report that they are only happy if their partner is happy. Therefore they will often focus tremendous energy on their intimate relationships.

What's Wrong With Being A Nice Guy?

We might be tempted to minimize the problem of the Nice Guy Syndrome. After all

Nice Guys themselves frequently have a difficult time grasping the depth and seriousness of their beliefs and behaviors. When I begin working with these passively pleasing men, ""What is wrong with being a Nice Guy?"" Having picked up this book and puzzled over the title, you may be wondering the same thing.

By giving these men the label Nice Guy,"" they will be loved, get their needs met, and have a smooth life.

The term Nice Guy is actually a misnomer because Nice Guys are often anything but nice. Here are some Not-So-Nice Traits of Nice Guys:

Nice Guys are dishonest. These men hide their mistakes, and repress their feelings. These traits make Nice Guys fundamentally dishonest . Nice Guys are secretive. Because they are so driven to seek approval, Nice Guys will hide anything that they believe might upset anyone. The Nice Guy motto is, ""If at first you don't succeed, hide the evidence.""

Nice Guys are compartmentalized. Nice Guys are adept at harmonizing contradictory pieces of information about themselves by separating them into individual compartments in their minds. Therefore

Nice Guys are manipulative. Nice Guys tend to have a hard time making their needs a priority and have difficulty asking for what they want in clear and direct ways. This creates a sense of powerlessness. Therefore

Nice Guys are controlling. A major priority for Nice Guys is keeping their world smooth. This creates a constant need to try to control the people and things around them.

Nice Guys give to get . Though Nice Guys tend to be generous givers, they want someone to stop being angry at them, etc. Nice Guys often report feeling frustrated or resentful as a result of giving so much while seemingly getting so little in return.

Nice Guys are passive-aggressive. Nice Guys tend to express their frustration and resentment in indirect, forgetting, being late, not following through, not being able to get an erection, climaxing too quickly, and repeating the same annoying behaviors even when they have promised to never do them again.

Nice Guys are full of rage. Though Nice Guys frequently deny ever getting angry

Nice Guys are addictive. Addictive behavior serves the purpose of relieving stress, it has to come out somewhere. One of the most common addictive behaviors for Nice Guys is sexual compulsiveness.

Nice Guys have difficulty setting boundaries. Many Nice Guys have a hard time saying ""no

Nice Guys are frequently isolated. Though Nice Guys desire to be liked and loved

Nice Guys are often attracted to people and situations that need fixing. This behavior is often the result of the Nice Guy's childhood conditioning, this tendency pretty much guarantees that Nice Guys will spend most of their time putting out fires and managing crises.

Nice Guys frequently have problems in intimate relationships. Though Nice Guys often put tremendous emphasis on this part of their lives, Nice Guys tend to blame their partner for standing in the way of their happiness.

Nice Guys have issues with sexuality. Though most Nice Guys deny having problems with sex, climaxes too quickly), or has sexually acted out (through affairs, prostitution, pornography, compulsive masturbation, etc.).

Nice Guys are usually only relatively successful. The majority of Nice Guys I've met have been talented, they fail to live up to their full potential. ""

If you don't have time for the long story, so I have no problem making this super long, but you want good advice right? Here's the long of it:

More than a year ago now, and we went out. Somehow along the way I started a relationship from there. 

Things were happy and life was good. We were in the early stages of the relationship, was getting nice internships and shit. Played soccer and all that crap. 

So it appeared to me that she had it all, is somewhat pressuring, because here I am, a guy in his early 20's that just goes to school part time, works IT during the day, and smokes weed and plays video games by night. A common thought in the back of my head was that I hoped she didn't think I was any less than her.

I'm 22 years old, I have a firm grasp on what my priorities are, and always make sure I can do what I can to see that my significant other is happy, which is what anyone should always try to do. I'm a decent, average guy is what I'm saying.

Let me throw out there

About a few months into the relationship she tells me we need to have a serious talk. She tells me that she doesn't like it when I'm high, she wasn't too far off there) and that I invest way to much of my time into video games that amount to nothing in real life. She said that I should do other things with my time. Perhaps cut down gaming to only on the weekends, and completely abstaining from smoking weed. Being the nice guy that I am, I do so, because I believed she was making me a better person.

I held strong for a while, which as a former catholic, was compelling and very interesting to me. 

When I brought up all this to her, she first said ""Is this really what you're thinking of doing? Because anyone that I'm with, that doesn't have faith, I can't be with.""

Now I finally stopped giving the benefit of the doubt at this point, she is a Greek Orthodox) and she's now putting the relationship on an ultimatum. It made me think, what would happen in a world where I was with this girl for a while, we started some family, and then I tell her I am an atheist now, would she really drop everything and leave? Seemed ridiculous to me. Even more ridiculous when she said she'd actually do that.

At that point I realized I wasn't actually enjoying myself anymore. Here I was, and the person she wanted me to turn into for her, wasn't me being myself. And that is a serious issue.

I had bought into the ""sacrifice"" bullshit before, they must be themselves, and be with someone who WOULDN'T change a thing. Where you can truly just exist with someone, and not care. 

This may or may not be the worst relationship article ever, is you, and that's beautiful. Embrace it and find someone else that can do the same, and you will have a great shot of being happy in life. Don't force similarities, and always remember that Love isn't all roses.

~Ernie

UPDATE: I have plenty more stories and experience to share and dwell on

I'm just a guy that wants people to know that no one has to be perfect to be happy.


UPDATE: It turns out I made the right decision. I recently started dating a girl that I've known for a while

Funny thing was was once we made it official on facebook

""have fun with your rebound."" 

I was pretty wierded out considering I blocked her from looking at my facebook. I was also pretty dissappointed that she was stilll that attached to me. I mean

I am going to elaborate deeper on this situation in another article, is that she is just craving attention to stay relevant.  She can't stand the fact that I'm happy and better off without her, so she's getting me upset to keep herself relevant.

If you are ever being bothered by a harassing ex, the whole reason they are saying the things they are, is to get a rise out of you, and your only playing into their hand when you show face. Be the classier, more mature human being, and come to terms with the bullshit for what it is: bullshit, and no one wants to waste their time on bullshit.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/xmaqm/dont_be_with_someone_who_simply_cant_appreciate/
1340823718.0,vp68n,Expectations and Assumptions,dogandcatinlove,24,9,14,"If I could offer one piece of advice

Leave your assumptions at the door. Carry only the necessary expectations.

Changing just these habits has made my dating life SO much happier and healthier! I'd like to elaborate a little bit. 

Assuming basically means to think someone else is going to behave in a certain way without any indication from THEM that they will do so. For example:

-Assuming a guy/girl will return your call/text

-Assuming a guy/girl is (or isn't) interested in you

-Assuming a guy/girl will remember your birthday

-Assuming a guy/girl wants to hang out

The key here is that you think these things will happen WITHOUT INDICATION FROM THE OTHER PERSON. Never assume. Ever. Ever ever ever.

And expectation is different. An expectation is thinking that a person will do something based on an indication FROM THAT PERSON. An expectation can also be a rule you maintain to preserve your self-respect. 

*Expectations can only increase with the seriousness of the relationship.*

Examples:

-Baseline expectation: A person will avoid disrespecting me via insults

-Dating expectation: The guy/girl should call at 6pm IF they said they will call at 6pm. The guy/girl should pick you up for dinner at 8:30 IF they said they will pick you up at 8:30. 

-Exclusively Dating expectation: The guy/girl should stop having sex with other people IF they said they want to stop having sex with other people. The previous (dating) expectations still hold here.

-Serious Relationship expectation: The other expectations carry over

See how the expectations build, your expectations are *very* few. Expect to be treated with respect. Don't expect to be treated like a significant other.

The #1 way to avoid assumptions and make your (FEW) expectations clear is *communication*. You have every right to ask your date/partner/spouse to be specific. You have no right to be disappointed when they don't meet your ASSUMPTIONS because you haven't shared with them your EXPECTATIONS.

Hope this helps others as much as it has helped me!

My girlfriend and I are 18 and 21 respectively. We've been dating for 6 months. A couple days ago we got our marriage license and scheduled our civil ceremony at the courthouse in a month.

**The Issue**

We don't know how our parents will take it so we've chosen not to tell them. The bigger issue is keeping it a secret because marriage comes with certain legal responsibilities.

**Response to Expected Concerns**

We're too young to make such a serious commitment

&gt;*I've been married twenty years now

I believe my girlfriend and I have the kind of determination and compassion, happy, and healthy marriage requires.

**What I'd like from r/relationship_tips**

If you disagree with my decision to get married young, please feel free to voice any concerns, if you're convincing enough then canceling the civil ceremony only takes a phone call. If you have something encouraging and supportive to say that'd also be appreciated. At the end of the day this is something I'm kinda set on doing, and the only thing that would stop me for sure would be a negative legal side-effect that would make my life or my soon-to-be wife's life more complicated. I'll give you a couple examples of dodged bullets.

**Filing Tax Returns**

My fiancee and I are both dependent on our parents

**Health Insurance Coverage**

I'm a dependent on my mom's health insurance and getting married usually makes one legally independent and ineligible for dependent coverage. Luckily, are eligible dependents. I still need to call to double-check that our specific plan covers this but I'm feeling pretty confident.

**Over-thinking**  
Everyone does this. I do it. But you need to realize this: The longer you think about ""Should I ask her out?"" ""What if..."" ""I don't know...""

Inaction is NOT what you want. You will never learn anything by not doing anything (except maybe your SO/potential SO getting pissed about you not doing anything).

Trust your first instinct and go for it. If you fail, you tried! That's what matters! The more actions you take, the more confident you will feel about doing more. You won't think about failing; you'll start thinking ""Whatever. She's missing out. NEXT!"" or ""Ok, I need to adjust this for next time."" THIS is the mindset you need.

**TALK!**  
You have something on your mind that has been bugging you about your SO. She's been drinking too much. He's ignoring you for WoW. You feel it's unfair that you're making all the effort in the relationship.

Instead of talking to your friends about it (or worse, they are not aware of what's going on or what your feelings are. Remember...they can't read your mind.

Her and I have been together for a little over two and a half years now. We started going out in high school, she was very angry. We almost didn't make it, but we both agreed we wanted to try and that it was worth it. She came home for winter break and everything got a lot better during that month of contact.

Recently, and will always be, more important to her than me, to the point that she wouldn't really hesitate to end us if our relationship somehow got in the way of school. I get this, school is very important, but that still hurts a lot to hear.

Just last night, instead of trying to get to the bottom of why I was having that concern, she just kept saying it was “ridiculous” and when I would continue explaining, she would exclaim “wow” or “really”. She just sat there shooting my concerns down over and over, and getting angrier and angrier.
I genuinely don’t feel like we’re a couple sometimes. I feel like I’m her friend

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m scared of talking to her because it seems to always end with her mad at me. This doesn’t mean I don’t try to talk to her. I try a lot. I just go into it with a massive knot of fear in my stomach.

Whenever I ask, to make it work, but she doesn’t seem to put in the effort to try half the time. I bring this up and she starts listing things that she does do, and my argument that “I appreciate that very much, but the two things I do ask for, you don’t do” isn’t valid to her. Essentially, I get the “I’ve done all this other stuff. You need to be grateful.” feeling from her.

I’m considering moving out to be with her in several months, I’m all of a sudden a huge bad guy, and anything I say has no more meaning. When we talk about me moving, she said ""I'm just concerned"". When I press the issue, she just says ""I dunno, I just am."" She's such an indecisive person, I feel like I make a lot of the decisions, if I make the wrong one...

I have no clue what happened. She is such an angry/pessimistic person nowadays. She never used to be. She does have some severe depression issues

I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I don't mean much to her anymore and she pretty much scoffs at me when I suggest this. She got very blunt and cold in her style of texting last fall, randomly saying ""I love you"" or ""I miss you"", doing things like making arts and crafts and sending them to me on a whim. She pretty much stopped last fall, and like I said, it caused an issue.

I have been with this amazing man for 6 years. We have been together through thick and thin, landlord grievances and the frustrations of being full time college students and full time workers. We have had disagreements but never really fought. We do everything together and have our own seperate hobbies we do on our own. It's wonderful. We love everything about one another and support each other in everything we do and it has been 6 years. We have discussed ""going further"" but nothing has happened. I remeber him telling me that some statistic percentage of marraiges end in divorce; I told him that we've lasted longer than most relationships. He told me that the church or the state should have absolutely no hand in saying who is or who is not together and we are togther because he loves me; I proposed then, that we handfast with both our families present and that would be our ""marriage"". He told me a ring is too expensive; I told him that there was a vending machine at the grocery store that had rings for a quarter. He said there are ""expectations"" in a marriage; I told him I would make the sandwiches then and keep his playing cards organized. 

I am not questing his love for me. He has never given me reason to doubt it and he wants to remain with me and he said so. I beleive him. It's been 6 years. Maybe this is a man thing,False,,t5_2sa5c,False,,,t3_18d7va
1360122636.0,17z99y,Her Past.,imgonnabe500miles,20,6,5,"I know this is a pretty popular topic on here

When you dwell on her past, you'd ask, knowing the answer might upset you. 

I have a beautiful girlfriend, absolutely lovely. But when I was having issues with her past, I didn't see that. I saw her as dirty. Of course I cared for her a lot then, but I still saw her in a negative light in this respect. And you've all heard it, ""all you need to do is look at the good stuff"". It sounds so generic, right? Like, okay, it's still there. You probably even visualize, as if there's a fire in your heart. This is probably how it's been so far. At least that's how it was for me. 

It almost felt like a struggle to be in that relationship. I don't know why I felt like that. I wasn't insecure. I still dwelled on it though

And then I realized something. This is going to sound cheesy as fuck by the way

I love her. I love who she is. I find her personality, all of her, completely intriguing. I consider myself an introvert, but when I'm with her, that usual need of time alone just isn't there. So why the fuck was I fretting about her past? Her past (and by her past I mean her complete past, not just the small percentage of her past that you seem to be stuck on) is what made her who she is today. She has experienced things, lived and learned, so why am I torturing myself? 

So after constant nagging and finding things out, *hers*. I have no business there. 

You say the images pop up, they don't. Your curiosity about her past isn't going to stop by the way. No matter how much you find out, you'll want to know more, fully knowing it will hurt you. It's kind of like your curiosity about the drama that was happening in high school, you're just being nosey at this point and have nothing to gain except juicy drama -- with the exception with that in this case, those details will fuck you over later because you'll keep dwelling on the past. 

PS. Your imagination is going to run wild with the details. When you imagine that shit

If her past ever ""pops"" up, there is literally a hand pushing the past to the side and I see her smile. Might sound counterintuitive, but I know she is mine now. I know her present is me, and I love her to the point where thinking of her destroys any of those thoughts regarding her past. 

PSS. Stop fucking thinking about the specifics you asked for. You need to think generally. I don't know about the next guy, I think ""her past."" Period. What I mean is keep it civil you perverted fuck. 

For example, ""oh, so and so she has a past with"" AT MOST. Hell, it'd be even better if you stop making that association at all, and when she tells that story, you just think of him as her friend that she went with. To summarize the pps, if you feel that urge to think of her past

**tl;dr direct your attention on her, and realize your curiosity is going to royally fuck you if you keep asking questions about this shit as if it was some high school drama.**

It was my first serious relationship, coming to my concerts, and talking most nights when we weren't in the same town), he was pretty consistent about doing most of them.

The problem is, he did that--and only that. He was great at not doing bad things for the relationship like judging me or pressuring me (intentionally anyway), but at doing proactive things like complimenting me or telling me he loved me or any sweet things like that, it just didn't happen on its own. I had to ask for it every time.

When we got into fights I would find myself saying ""I just need you to show me you care more

The way he sees it, I wouldn't talk to him for two or three days until he texted me, which I hated. However, there was no way for me to say that without feeling ashamed of my needs, so the fight always ended with me agreeing that I needed to be less needy and that I would work on it.

I tried to get better at expressing my needs, I asked if he wanted to come over to my house (he works closer to my house than his, actually) during his three hour lunch break and I could make him lunch and we could hang out, so that I could see him more than just once or twice on the weekends (he works long hours and goes home exhausted every night). He said he just needed that time to relax and didn't want to come over. When I said I was kind of upset about that, he said that was unreasonable to expect. That was our last big fight and then we broke up that week.

I don't want you to think I just took his sacrifices for granted or something. I learned a little about the ""5 ways people show love"" and I looked for all of them, he just never expressed his love. After we broke up he actually said some heartbreakingly emotional loveydovey things, that he had never mentioned during the relationship. As far as I can tell, he actually feels like the victim in this relationship because he was getting the message that he wasn't good enough.

TL;DR nice guy who got very detached and put little effort into the relationship

Last summer, because I didn't want to make anything worse. For months i felt like i was tiptoeing around, just trying to not make her/us worse. That really got to me and i withdrew. 

Next thing we knew, because she was too depressed/anxious to want anything romantic when i would try, which wasn't often because i felt so rejected. Finally this late winter, we decided to spend some time apart, so i left to stay at my friends place. We talked every day, but were getting no where.

 I've done plenty of thinking and feel like I've changed and can bring real change and improvement back to our relationship and how i communicate my feelings, and that it wasn't our relationship that made her unhappy, but the other way around, that it fell apart because we both let it, because she wouldn't let me help her, and once i stopped she felt (rightly so) like i gave up. Now I feel like she was so unhappy, something needed to change

I've started compiling a list of  topics to cover when we talk(soon), how i feel like she has given up on fixing our relationship because it would be hard, and because she can't be sure it would work out in the end. Get very specific about my feeling for her and how much our entire relationship has meant to me, which i never properly expressed before. To talk about how we promised to love each other in good times and bad, and this is really the first bad time we've had, and we can't just give up on it. And finally to ask her straight out if she still loves me and if she wants to fix things (not if she thinks we can, but if she even wants to try). 

Does this approach seem reasonable? I feel like I'm really going to put it all on the line telling her how i feel and changes I want to make, how did you get them to at least try?

On the other I don't want to just be pumping 1/3 of my paycheck into his future investment while he doesn't even pay 'rent.'   Should I just plan on paying average rent prices, or is it reasonable to ask to contribute less?

3.  He makes about 2x as much as me, I have a part time job and am a student.  Is it even fair of me to consider this in any of our decision making?  

4.   Any other big concerns I should consider?  I think we can figure out the chores and cooking

Been living together now for over a year. (Known each other for much longer)

Found careers together. (Separate fields

We've both traveled a lot before we knew each other.

Age isn't an issue. The relationship isn't an issue. I see myself with her forever.

The issue is the proposal!

She has been asking for well over 6 months now for a Pomeranian puppy. Our apartment isn't pet friendly

We went and looked at puppies. She fell in love with this one little black fur ball. 
 
She will be out of town for a week during the move. I'm moving the stuff by myself. So I convinced her that I can't watch a new puppy and move the house

So I called the breeder and told her my plan: I will still buy the puppy

Now comes my real set of dilemmas.. I'm going to ask her to marry me at the airport. I'm not sure how.

Do I get a name tag that reads ""Will you marry me?""

Do I put a ring on the dog collar? Is a silver band acceptable so she can pick one out herself if she wants? I can't just ask her though.. it will raise suspicion. 

Is this a good idea at all? Should I wait until she is home? Usually I know what to do when it comes to her

Any girls care to shed some light on this? Is there any way this can go wrong? (I mean other than her saying no

My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 4 months now (though we were best friends for over a year) and we're madly in love. We talk about getting married and having kids and growing old together and all that gooey romance stuff. He's the love of my life and the sex is earth-shattering.... buuut I think it would be kind of hot to add another woman to the bedroom to spice things up.

I love having sex women

How do I approach this situation? I'm really embarrassed/nervous to ask him for a threesome because I think he may feel my desires mean I don't truly love him. I would never push him to do something he didn't want to

I think I have these dreams because I love him so much. I used to have dreams similar to these about my mother leaving me when I was little.

I was introduced to this guy through a mutual friend just over a month ago
Ever since then, going out on his boat, and just having a good time together.
I got the gist of his situation almost immediately - his divorced finalized earlier this year
He's hurting
On top of that
I think that's why he parties so much...I mean

As soon as we got to the lake at sunrise, and how hard it was for him to see her with another guy, and how he learned of two more cheating episodes he didn't know about. They'd had alot of memories at the very lake we were at, and it was going to be hard for him to be there again.

My heart breaks for him, he basically tells me he's not over his ex's drama as much as he thought he was. 

It just ruined my whole trip. I couldn't be myself
I knew he didn't want a serious relationship - he'd told me this before

I know it's probably going to take him at least a couple years to be in anyway emotionally ready to have intimacy with a woman again, but false hopes that he'll see what a great girl he has right in front of him.
All he talks about is horror stories of his ex - even while camping at the lake with 12 other people - it was embarrassing for me to sit by him while all he talked about was her

I am pent up and uncomfortable
Then he reaches out and shows me a moment of tenderness

I'm starting to get my feelings hurt, but I kind of understand how these things take time to heal.
 
I just don't think it's worth my emotional effort to be around him anymore, a bond, with someone, that we can enjoy together, and I just can't have that with him. I don't know what else I want to get out of this, but to get it off my chest, that it hurts. 


UPDATE: He only texted me once in a week after the trip, of course) and the guy had the nerve to tell one the girls that he wasn't that into me, and didn't know how to tell me, and felt bad.

I've had a few casual relationships with women but they always turned out badly. Many just never went anywhere. One girl ignored me for a whole year because I cried in front of her. 

My best friend Katie was my first real love. She was the one to suggest a more intimate relationship, or tucked behind her purse in the back seat of the car. The occasional kiss she allowed me was awkward and hurried. When I said I loved her, she would simply smile or nod. I was happy, she was not, and I was too blinded by my own feelings to see this.

This continued for about a year. I saw less and less of her. Fortunately

I had to spend the whole day with her just a few yards from me. Finally, I wandered around for almost 3 hours. My hands were bruised and bloody. I'm an artist, my hands are precious, my love is precious, they both must go. I lied my way into obtaining work gloves and made my way back to the class building. Katie was there, standing  outside. Avoiding her questions I went to the nearest phone to get picked up.

Everything spiraled out of control for me at that point. I stayed in bed for a month. Senior year came around and I could barely keep up with my friends there. One morning, and then he suddenly was gone. It left me numb. My own brother had aspergers. What if I lost him too? I was invited over after his funeral to stay the night. I held Katie all night as she cried.

My aunt's cat died too, but the headaches didn't. I slept all the time, I couldn't do anything. The medications didn't work. Finally, I went back to school, if only for my mental health. By then I was on daily doses of hydrocodone.

All I wanted was to be healthy and happy. I reconnected with my friends, tangible-but I realized this caused me no comfort, only a grave sadness from my family. I swore I would never hurt myself again. I became a regular at the ""bro"" lunch table. One such bro was Jake. He didn't really talk to me much. All I could really tell mas that he had a nice head of curly hair and a wonderful nose. That, and the fact that he had the appetite of no other person I had ever seen in my life. He would sometimes join my friend's ""artist table movie nights"". Showing up more and more often, I wondered where this dude had come from. He was a charming fellow. Geeky in all aspects and always full of information. One day we discovered he only lived about 3 blocks from my house! That's when I started to accompany him on his walks around the neighborhood. He shared with me his music, his old school, his memories

Despite my pain I was determined to attend Senior Ball. I had already missed out on enough. I went with two art buddies, and some cute asian chick I didn't know. Rachel had made  matching caution tape flower bracelets and pins for us. Jake and I became a sort of ""fake, old-fashioned, sophisticated couple"" for the evening. I had never enjoyed daces, but I had the time of my life. I forgot entirely about my headache.

That night we all slept over at Tom's house. Movies went into chatting which led to truth or would you rather, despite him knowing I was gay. I wanted to let him down gently, he was such a nice guy and I didn't want to hurt him. But instead I said yes. I still don't know why.

That summer was the best summer of my life. I've never felt so close to someone before. We spent almost every day together. He was like no other guy I had ever known before. He never asked anything of me


Jake is currently off at college to study engineering. Despite being 8 hours away we still talk every day and I look forward to visiting him next month and every other time afterwards.

Enough with the sob story, the ones appropriate to this post, anyway; I have plenty of them) have to do with dating. I'm not really starting yet, but I'm a ""be prepared"" kind of guy. I'm going to be dating again soon, definitely casually for a while, and I want to get some idea of how I ought to approach some things.

1.  Ideas on getting out there and meeting some women would be great. I'm familiar with the general ideas of joining clubs where I might meet women with interests similar to mine, i.e., a guy who isn't going to have a lot of time to burn? I'm not going to be looking for my next wife, certainly not anytime soon, so what are the best ways to try to start casually dating in this life that's so different from college, where I'm not randomly meeting tons of cute, single girls all of the time? Anyone have favorite ideas for how you would like or expect to meet a guy in my situation?

2.  What is casual dating like for a guy like me - or what SHOULD it be like. I mean

3.  How much have grooming expectations changed in eighteen years? I mean, I'm in pretty good shape for a guy who's closer to 40 than 35. I'm a professional, so I generally dress neatly enough, keep my hair neatly cut, have my beard either clean-shaven or (if I'm feeling crazy) neatly trimmed down to a bit of scruff, and eyebrows trimmed enough (usually when I get my hair cut) that they don't turn into the old man caterpillars. Is there anything else outward that I need to see to?

The thing is, and they're terrific. They even drew art for me (like an entire sketchbook)!


I want to tell them what I do, e-mails they rarely respond to, texts even less, and the only time I can get them to respond is if I bother them on Twitter - which means it's public, and I'd rather keep it private. Telling them in person is not an option anymore (they live in Japan/I already left).

I'm not quite sure how to approach this. Tips are very appreciated.

A little background on me: I used to be a Christian.. but i was more of what i'd call a very ""strict christian"". I was heavily involved in local ministry in college, conflicting translations, how the Bible was put together, etc. In the end, after years of struggle, i lost my faith and i accepted that i no longer believed in the god of the Bible (or the god of other major religions in the world). 

My view now is that maybe there's a god

She was raised in a very strict Christian home

Our differing faiths are the only real problem we have. For me, prayer. 

It's a much larger worry/issue for her. While she does not regularly attend worship service, I always tell her that she should continue doing it if it works for her.

I offered to attend a church service with her.. something that later happened, we both knew i was just going through the motions. While she appreciated me reaching out to her and doing this, it hurt her to know that i was not there for a higher purpose (God). i was only there for her.

She says that she loves me and can see a future together for us, im not the agnostic guy who is going to say that my wife and children are prohibited from attending church. Instead, i'd like to raise my children to be free thinkers... though I think it's nearly impossible to raise children in america without them being indoctrinated to some extent. I personally was not raised in a strict christian environment, but i still believed it for years. I took me into my early 20's to really start to question things. I just want my children to be good people and open-minded. If they end up being Christians, that's ok with me, so long as they aren't the kind who go forcing it on other people disrespectfully.

* Can you generally tell if your SO is having an issue *without* him/her saying anything?

**Disclaimer:** The opinions expressed represent my own and only my own. They are conjecture and speculation based solely on my observation and personal experience. This is not a comprehensive compendium covering concerning situations completely. (It is not intended to answer any and all problems

**The problem/observation:** The problems and most of the advice here is based around and phrased in the context of ""what should I do?""

• I'm feeling something I don't like
• My bf/gf did or said or does something I dislike
• Should we stay together or break up? 
• How do I start a relationship with a boy/girl?

The majority of problems expressed around these parts are variations of these questions. I'll address each of them individually

**The Gist:** I feel the approach to a problem is of equal importance as the solution. Very little attention is paid in regards to HOW someone should think about the problem that they are currently addressing. This type of mental engineering can be a powerful tool. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**My bf/gf did or said or does something I dislike

The first step here is to identify not just the ""thing"" that your SO did that doesn't sit well

For instance

How it makes you feel: Probably a little jealous and insecure. 

Why: You wonder if they are harboring feeling for the ex (jealous and insecure). You are concerned what others think (insecure). You don't like to be reminded they dated another person (jealous with a possessive twist).  

The next step

How to consider if you're wrong:

To get your mind in the right place for this exercise you need to do a few things. Remind yourself that you have a bias toward yourself. Be skeptical. 

You now what to try and understand the other persons point of view. This is something people do often

**DO NOT ASSUME OTHER PEOPLE THINK LIKE YOU!** If you are trying to understand their point of view by imagining what YOU would do in their situation, or your ""common sense."" Thinking outside the context of your own mind is a precious skill that takes discipline and practice.

To continue the example above. Take a step back. Does your boyfriend or girlfriend keep pretty much everything? Is he/she nostalgic. Does this person consider his past a strong way to define and identify who he is today? Is there any evidence (outside of photos/memorabilia) to indicate he has questionable feelings toward the ex. 

So say your SO a ""scrap booker"", it would MEAN something. In all likelihood your SO having those things probably doesn't indicate that they might still have feelings for a past lover. That does NOT mean that those photos aren't important to your SO. They could still be very important.

The key is to consider what you know about them to be true. Rely on observation and be accepting of wherever that takes you. It might not make sense

 It's now time to consider the dilemma as a whole. What are you going to ask them to do or change? How big of an adjustment is it for THEM? How much will it probably matter to THEM? And compare that do how much this ""thing"" bothers you. Basically, and how much it matters to you (a little), you might want to consider not bringing it up at all. This is called ""picking your battles.""

If you decide it's worth the trouble to bring it up

Once you feel like you both understand each others side of the argument

As a side note: If someone is really emotionally charged. You lose NOTHING by suggesting you share some of the blame. It makes them feel a lot better and can defuse the situation. Arguments are not about who is right or wrong They are about making changes so you both can get what you want.

A little background, the next being three years and the most recent being three months with a courting time of three years (as friends). If I had to come up with the number one complaint of all my previous girlfriends it would be that I’m great at the chase but not so much after. I try to follow the adage of “date your wife” in my case girlfriend, but while I try, it seems I’m always hearing “you’re not lovey dovey enough.” 

The first relationship ended because she felt like I was growing disinterested in the relationship and ended up falling for my best friend, babe, I feel the same way too, I love you a lot.” And I would want to go on talking about other things. After we broke up which was not entirely related to my non romance, she told me that she felt like I didn’t really like the relationship at all and sometimes doubted how much I really loved her, and to me she’s “the one that got away” I loved her like no other and in a lot of ways still do, and it hurt a lot to hear that from her. My most recent relationship I kept the chase up for three years and her interest in me up for the entire time, it’s like you’ve got me and stopped.” A month later we broke up.

To an extent that is how I work, I had flowers delivered to her at work when she was having a hard time at the new office, I can think of a lot of other times I did romantic things for all three but the issue is still there.

So I lie there, so that we're back to back, which isn't very loving at all, which I really hate, but its the only way I can fall asleep.  Many times, I'd end up waking her up 3-5 times throughout the night before I fall asleep, which isn't very considerate.

I contacted him a little over a year ago to catch up


However, I suggested hanging out again to my ex (since we had done coffee before), he said it sounded like a good idea, but then he kind of went off the map. He stopped contacting me like he had been and it changed from a text-once-a-month friendship to being a friendly facebook acquaintance relationship. He would 'like' a post on my wall, I sent him a message saying sorry when his pet died.


Even though it was probably not all that unfriendly (maybe he didn't feel like staying in such frequent contact with someone who lives several hours away, and I felt jealous of FB posts of him and his new gf, even though I DO NOT want to date him and I absolutely adore my boyfriend. I unfriended him a little over a month ago late one night when I was particularly exhausted/sad so I wouldn't have to see those posts. To be blunt, I screwed up.


Now, but I'd like for us at least be friendly acquaintances who don't hold any unnecessary grudges.


I'm concerned that since we run in similar circles back home that sometime in the future I'll run into him again, what should I say? I thought about citing the mass facebook purge excuse but my gut says he won't believe it. I know facebook should not be the be-all and end-all of real life relationships, but unfortunately it has an impact--it really boils down to me wanting to retract the rude message I conveyed by unfriending him, since for some reason, acts in facebook = acts in meatspace.

I had an epiphany this week and realized we are becoming her parents.  They didn't have kids until their 30's (not typical at all where I live)

I always feel lonely and we just had a blow out fight because its Saturday afternoon and I wanted to go do something.  She could tell I was upset and asked what was wrong then kept poking it as I tried to deflect it.  I burst and laid it all out.

Short version: My BF finally confessed on his own accord that he had been cheating on me with one of his ex girlfriends from when we met --&gt; month 6. Kept it from me (and convinced his friends to lie for him) until month 13. Told me the news two days before Christmas :(

I had a no-bullshit policy since day one. We agreed that our lives were an open book to one another, etc. Just wasn't necessary, and I didn't desire to. I told him that if I was going to be in a relationship, I would tell him the second I no longer wanted to be in one. We both agreed.

So obviously I was heartbroken. With much courage and strength

- Berated him for the first day. Explained to him what a lucky piece of shit he was to have (or have had) me. Cried.
- took a week without contacting him. told him that on day 7 he could contact me with his 'resolve
- mourned for the fact that it meant more for me at that point to say 'I love you' to him than him to say it to me because of his actions.
- drew my bottom line: if by the end of the month (it was the 10th) I didn't see myself capable of positive progression towards forgiveness and recovery
- exercised a shit ton. endorphins! and even felt GREAT when I looked at FB pictures of this girl and felt better about how much prettier I was than her (a low blow
- picked up his phone call on day 7. he had severed ties with her as far as he could (they went to high school together and after all, he had sat down with his family and admitted his actions, asking for help to save our relationship. His mother had smacked him on the back of the head for me. She cried, and later told me he had never asked for any advice of that kind before.
- I went out on a limb, the pleads; but I put my faith in the man who told me he needed to re-evaluate his whole life and the direction he was going as indicated by his cheating behavior. 
- everything was a day-to-day basis with trust. Some days it was better

- rebuilt the trust on my half. I was *SO* angry at him for a while because he had dug a hole this deep
- we are approaching year 2,' but since i put in the work to revive our trust, this is the most communicative, constructive, loving, forgiving, respectful

She's on medication and generally ""normal"". About 3 months ago I started having suspicions that I wasn't the only guy in her life. After asking probing questions several times and having a strong instinct that she was evasive

I confronted her with her phone in-hand and without concealing my spying. She denied everything straight to my face, etc.), I had to open the particular text-message and show her before she would acnowledge the accusation. She told me they had met once, and she´d known the second she saw him that her feelings were false and that I was the one she loved and that nothing happened that evening except they ate dinner and shared a few drinks at the bar, my instincts tell me she´s telling the truth about not having sex, not that it matters really.) I was furious, but kept it in check. I decided there was a tricky but possible future for us, the most important of which was that she would never

Fast forward 3 weeks, trying to fill in the gaps and getting a full grasp of the situation. I wanted to know more about the guy. She didn´t want to tell me his last name, I insisted that there be no more secrets between us and she relented. I proceeded to find out as much as I could about the guy and showed her his facebook page to confirm it was him. She said I should stop and that this was pointless. I kept on pushing, and she told me that wasn´t the guy (someone random she´d once hooked up with in a bar), that infact it had been her ex, what had thrown me off was that she had used his middle-name in the text conversation.
She said she had lied to make things easier

In any case

So, rely on facts. Without her knowledge I have access to her facebook, e-mail and phone(text-messages and call logs via spy app). I've gone through her home, her credit card bills and checked every entry.
So far nothing suspicious. So what I'm asking for is this: those of you whom have caught cheating SO's


I have kept the text factual to get to the point quickly, people can learn and thus change. I also believe people lie, so looking for someone else is not my idea of a solution, it's surrendering. The spying is not to satisfy my curiosity and give me a sense of control alone, it has a purpose: Nasty and morally wrong as it is, it provides temporary stability and solid ground for me to stand on while repairing the damage. There can be trust in the future, but not as long as I'm worried about the present. It's disgusting to me to have to go through her garbage so to speak in this manner and I don't plan on doing it for longer than I have to. What would also help tremendously

My issue is something that has gone on since the beginning. He gets annoyed when I ask questions he believes to be irrelevant. If I call him, ""So.. you're just staring blankly at a wall?"" He'll say, ""Yup."" It's always nothing unless he's doing something of importance. If he tells me he's cooking, I'll ask what he's cooking curiously, and he will say something on the lines of ""Why?"" and I'll respond, ""Because I'm curious?"" He'll say, ""Why do you need to know that? What do you get out of knowing that information?"" Another conversation was when I asked him again what he was doing a different time. He said he was shopping, ""At a store."" I said, but I do not recall exactly what he said
It's gotten to the point that when he can't just tell me what I ask

Me: ""What are you up to?""
Him: ""Shopping.""
Me: ""For what?""
Him: ""Food mostly. Why..?""
Me: ""Just curious. Is that a problem?""
Him: ""It's weird. Like me shopping isn't good enough info for you
Me: ""It upsets me that you make a big deal about it. just answer the question and get over it. I'm your girlfriend
Him: ""I told you what I was doing..""
Me: ""And I was curious where. It's not a weird thing to ask. Ask anyone. You're weird for finding it annoying/pointless.""
Him: ""I'm glad you found the information useful. I have no problem telling you what I'm doing. It's not about it being weird
Me: ""Significant others do that kind of shit because they are curious and they give a fuck unlike most other people you may know. It's not fucking weird. ASK SOMEONE."" (I'm upset because I want another person to tell him he's being odd so he can see. Everyone I tell says he is.)

1340722632.0,vmqos,Age difference success story 23m 34f,Robocobo,15,6,7,"There are multiple posts on this sub asking ""Will it work?"" or ""Is this creepy?"" I figured I'd put in my own insight

I met my girlfriend back in college as we were both studying for the same degree. We didn't talk much then except for the occasional school banter or awkward conversation. I took notice to her foo fighters shirt and circa survive sticker on her book and assumed we had more in common than music and our profession. 

A year later she had already graduated and I was fulfilling a clinical rotation at the hospital she was working at. After awkward nervous conversations about school we began having lunch together

Now let's get away from the history
When I met her I had no idea she has a 10 year old daughter or was actually 34. Her looks and interests indicated younger. I found out her age when we became Facebook friends and I realized her birth year was within the 70s. Scary at first but I was already fond of her.

I did not go into our relationship seeking a relationship. It basically started out for both of us as a ""hey you're attractive what could go wrong"" situation. No expectations thus no limits.

Personally I feel as though age CAN be a problem in a relationship. I have friends of mine close to my age who still live at home, sleep with disgusting 18 year old strumpets and have no problem with that. So someone living that way should not expect to have a chance with a settled down, established single mother who has no time for bullshit.

For us our places in life our similar. She was married for a short short time and was forced to move home after her divorce. We both after a year of being together decided to move in to a house together with her daughter. 

We still go out and live life and have a blast

It is true that future children

Our family and friends gave a raised eyebrow at first to the 11 year difference but once the social bias fades they realize what's important. 

Weve been together a little over a year and I couldn't be happier

I tried to make this brief. Feel free to comment with any questions 

Tl:dr age can be a problem if you're still acting like a kid
Places in life are more important
Social bias exists

So my boyfriend(24) and I(21) have been together since February and I love him very much.  He has BPD and has been hospitalized a few times for cutting.  He suffers from severe social anxiety (if we even go out on his porch he gets a bit unsettled).  He has been prescribed Zoloft to treat his depression and anxiety, he'll take a few.  



ANYWAY:




As I said, but it hurts all the same.  

I try to be accepting of the fact that he isn't good around people.  I know he tries very hard to be intimate with me.  He often turns down sex because he says that sometimes being touched doesn't feel good to him.   He was abused as a child, so I can understand why being touched or being close to someone could be hard...but it still hurts me when he rejects a hug or a kiss or even holding my hand.  




He has a great fear of abandonment



I sat him down about two weeks ago and told him exactly what I thought of him.  I told him that he's amazing and that I believe he can accomplish what he wants to accomplish.  I mean, so I told him we could work it out together.



He seemed to be in better spirits and he started taking Zoloft again.  This past Friday he left home to visit a few friends in the neighbouring city.  I was worried that while he was there



Friday night I called to remind him and he sounded pleasantly drunk.  I was excited because he sounded like he was having a great time.  Then he told me that he loved me and that I meant everything to him...and that I hurt him because I did not kiss him goodbye at the train station



The thing is...my boyfriend has freaked out about PDA so many times that I thought kissing him would make him uncomfy.  I explained this to him



His mom has a boyfriend in the area where his friend lives



I am angry that he broke his promises to me



Last night, he could just contact me first.  




I know that's a horrible thing for me to have said, I keep everything I feel inside.  I'm afraid to hurt him with my feelings...but I'm hurting myself by holding them in. 



I am trying to be understanding and accepting, he was curled up on his bed in tears.  I put my emotions aside and look after him because I really care for him.




Unfortunately




I suppose I'm venting in this post as well




Everything I say/don't say up to this point seems to be just common sense.  I am doing my best to be compassionate and patient.  I want him to feel safe with me.  




In any case, can anyone suggest better ways for both he and I to work through our conversations and our relationship in general?  



Was I unreasonable to ask him to step up and make an effort to contact me?

1368255561.0,1e49xb,[26/f] TOXIC coworker termination *help!?[~55/f],WITHNAILxI,12,0,15,"I've worked as a hospital employee for the past 5 years, but I was 22 and felt I was such a 'positive person', but near retirement. Donna started telling me that this Grandma-aged woman was a bad person
We had a short rotation of different coworkers before our supervisor hired a 50yr old black woman who has worked per diem at the hospital for years. Donna instantly disapproved loudly and to anyone who would listen. She had no solid reasons; she claimed the new woman wasn't ""cut out"" for evening shift. (secretly i thought she was being racist) Eventually, since I had always been friendly to her. I, however, had no problems with the new worker and would not support her case. Obviously, this made Donna's whole attitude toward me change. I was no longer on her good side and she made sure I felt it. She still managed to talk a couple of girls into reporting some petty issues and the 50yr old lady was fired.
I am now left with her… we have a rotation of random per diem employees who fill in the third spot, but now she was complaining AT me. ""I can't believe the day employees left this equipment out, but YOU won't complain because YOU'LL just clean it up for them""
""You don't know how bad it is, all out, negative complaining to the point where I just let her talk at me while I worked and gave one word responses ""oh"" ""yeah"" ""right""… A lot of it was personal attacks on my friendly character. She would accuse me of ''having a boyfriend"" because the housekeeper knows my name and smiles when we exchange Hello's. My supervisor came really close to having her fired once, but she was back at work the next day because she threatened HR with a law suit.
Last month, Donna had a melt down because someone had done something she felt wasn't ""protocol"" (it was NOT a big deal). She caught me alone in our office and started barking complaints at me, ""Dont you think we have protocols in place for a reason?! WHY does no one around here care! Why weren't YOU involved in correcting this issue? Whats the point in YOU being here, anyway?!"" …she had barked at me before, she told me that she ""knew"" I wasn't saying hello to her on purpose when I came into work, she had given me the silent treatment for days and refused to talk about it with me when I wanted it to end… but this last thursday felt like the thing that broke me. I called my supervisor. Met with her on Friday and told her everything. My supervisor asked me to meet with the HR department on Monday… Donna already has a long ''paper-trail'' with Human Resources since she has been fighting with everyone for so long. If I go in on Monday and report what this woman has been doing, I could be the thing that gets her fired. I DONT WANT THIS RESPONSIBILITY. I hate her so much but I'm struggling to justify this is my head.

I tend to become romantically/sexually interested in people I’m already friends with, it seems logical that you would progress from friends→dating. That being said, I definitely do not befriend people in the hopes of getting romantically involved with them, and the idea of “friend zone” strikes me as being bad for everyone. Usually it’s a case of meeting someone, striking up a conversation, getting to know them and realising that *hey this person is actually really awesome* and somehow they sort of become extremely attractive. I’m not averse to asking them on date or whatever, and if they decline then that’s ok. But I’m unlikely to make a move unless I already have some sort of rapport.

Morally and politically, traditional marriage, saving yourself for marriage, not doing drugs, limiting alcohol if any, working towards yourself and providing charity when you can and when benefitial. I am 100% Pro-Life and that doesn't stem from my religion at all.

On a relationship level I have never had a girlfriend. I wouldn't call myself extremely attractive, and used me as a rebound without knowing it. She also had moved a state away for college. She promised great dreams and I fell for it thinking she was perfect. I had known her for years and years and I was finally there to save her, the knight in shining armor. She is very religious and loves God but I believe she uses it the wrong way. She had sex with her ex boyfriend, is rebelling against her parents and justifies her choices by saying ""I did a lot of praying and I feel like God is leading me to do this. I'm still trying to get over her. I still think about her everyday and it hurts.

I have a new girl in my life. She is a strong Christian as well and has an amazing personality. I just don't feel strongly attracted to her physically. she is a year younger than me where the other was a year and a half older. I feel like she is a great influence in my life

I asked a girl to prom who I had a crush on, I felt awkward because she was pushing me to hook up with her at prom and I ended it over a month before prom.

2. How should I react to my feelings on my religion? I'm all for the messages just not sure about the actual God part and how will this play into my friendships?

We started dating in 9th grade and now that we're graduating college I plan to propose to her before she starts graduate school. We've come a long way from where we were and I know 100% that this is the right thing to do. The only thing standing in my way right now is asking her father.

I can level with her father on some topics. He happens to be really into the 1950's and has restored most of his house from salvaged 50's appliances. I'm studying to be a computer engineer so we can connect on trying to read old

See, he never puts more than two sentences together at a time. Trying to hold a conversation with his is a fruitless effort. He was also a Marine so he's very straight-to-the-point.

My girlfriend has formed a way of communication with him that consists mostly of body language. I've watched them do it for years and I only vaguely understand how it works. We'll be watching a movie and he'll shuffle by (they live in a 1950's ranch house). He'll reach over and ""bap"" her head. Baps are when you place one hand on someone's head and then make a ""bap"" noise by hitting your other hand onto the first. Then he'll shuffle off. From that she can understand his mood and intent. Sometimes it's turn down the volume other times it's ""be sure to wrap up by 2am"" or something. 

The final complication is that since I'm still at school I have to communicate with him over the phone. Given the timeframes for planning a surprise engagement party and getting both of our families there I need to ask him this weekend so it has to be over the phone. 

There is the matter of her step mom (basically her mom at this point)

&gt;==.


 

OK

* How do I make the call? Should I talk about something else first and transition to asking

* Should I arrange for both parents to be on the phone at the same time

* What do I do if he says nothing? Rejection I could handle

&gt;==.

**tldr;** Father has nearly autistic-level communication skills and due to party planning schedule I need to ask via a phone call this weekend. **HALP!**

I met this guy through my friend who attends NAU. She was home where we both hang out and at her house she introduced me to 2 guys she knows that live in her dorm hall. It was the day before all 3 of them had to go back down to flagstaff to start off this spring semester and it was the day I had to say bye before my friend left. While saying bye I started talking to one of the guys at her house and as we were talking come to find out we were both going through a break up. Both him and I were dumped over winter break and talking to him and knowing he felt the way I was was a nice feeling because we talked about it and understood. That night when I was leaving I said bye to my friend and said goodbye to him and that was that. The next day he sent me a friend request in Facebook along with a message saying to text him because he enjoyed talking to me and would love to continue getting to know me. So we start texting and learning more about one another and come to find out we have so much in common it was crazy! He loves the same type of music, is a family man, etc. i could go on forever! He then asked if i would drive up to see him because he was dying to hang out with me in person and I wanted to see him too! So that weekend I drove up to flagstaff 2 hours away and when i arrived he was the first one I saw waiting outside for me! We went up to his dorm and I sat down at his desk and out of the blue he showed me pictures of his family and went on talking about them which i loved to hear! He then had a fraternity meeting and I left his room but before I left he gave me one of his sweatshirts so I wouldnt freeze my butt off and while leaving he said ""tomorrow I have the whole day planned for us so be here by 9"" I was so excited and just full of butterflies because no guy has ever had anything planned for us to do. That next day I pick him and gave him the keys and he drove us to this amazing little park and we acted like kids! We played on the jungle gym, we threw snow at each other and took silly pictures, it just felt amazing! (At this point I felt weird because I knew part of me was falling for him and it was weird because it was only a week since i met him) Then after the park we went to a different park where he surprised me with a picnic and we talked and went on just about random stuff and I loved it because there was never an awkward moment! Later that day we went back to his dorm and laid in his bed just being lazy and watched movies the rest of the day! It was amazingly perfect. That night I was supposed to head back home for work the next morning but he convinced me to stay and I did and we shared an amazing kiss. I then surprised him the next day with donuts in bed and he looked so cute cuddled in my blanket :) I left and while leaving he kept begging me to stay but I knew I couldnt because of my job and school. We then continued on texting and he kept saying that I shouldve let him keep my blanket and to surprise him i sent it to him priority shipping so he could have it the next day! but then after a week it got weird. I had the opportunity to meet go up to flagstaff to see him and he said come but wouldnt have time to see me. I didnt go because all i wanted was to see him and then a week later I drive up there and go up to his dorm with my friend and all he does is look at me and say ""Hey"" no hug or anything...Now its been about a month since I have heard from him and I finally left him alone...i sent him a message saying i liked him and didnt wanna lose him as a friend and since I sent it I still havent heard from him. Its just so confusing because he was so perfect and now I dont know if I should forget about him and everything he is or keep trying...Im going back to flagstaff this weekend for orientation and I want to see him but I feel that if i even try to contact him he wont respond... I dont know what to do because I try my hardest not think about him but he was so perfect and special to me I cant seem to forget him...I'm just terribly confused :,( Help..!",,,,

I can't stop thinking about her and try to make myself closer to her. I have kept track of all the times that I can see her in the halls; I dress extra-nice on the days I will see her for stage crew or marching band; I'm taking a taking concert band over a study hall next semester just so I can see her every day; I joined marching band, but I feel a special connection with her because I see myself in her. She makes deep, she always told me good luck

She is unmarried and childless, either. I know she is probably a lost cause, but I am really saving my heart for her.
Since I skipped a grade, but I don't know when it would be best. Since she is the marching band director, I could attend a football game and ask for a moment alone, but I will still be 17 during the football season after I graduate.

Then there's the possibility that I do tell her on the night of my graduation and she says she likes me back. Wouldn't it be a bit straightforward of me to impose a 4-6 year romantic hiatus on someone who may not like me as much as I like them? If she says she'll wait, where gay marriage is currently outlawed. That could change, but I don't know.

My boyfriend (28) and I (f, partying in general, or others seeing too much of my cleavage.
He had many problems with earlier girlfriends like dealing with jealousy and controlling
I tried to respect his concerns and did not go out with friends anymore

After my exams for that semester we had a party going in our university department, but me drinking too much ended up being intoxicated, and sleeping at a fellow student's bed after he offered help. Although we did nothing, my bf was furious (what i seriously understand), and sais it was like cheating to him, because it 'could' have happened something.

After this incident everything changed. I totally understood his hatred on me, but he was so angry we nearly broke up. But then he offered some kind of 'contract' to me, of which I wonder until today if accepting to that could've been the bigger mistake of mine.
He suggested he could change his mind, if I could accept him being all rude and taking his hatred and his moods out on me whenever he wants, and as long as he needs. He was sure about being able to see me with other eyes again after he could just have his time calming down in his own way. Even though I knew it would never be the right way to deal with a problem to act this way, I agreed to his concept because he would not let me talk him towards alternatives or other options. Either his plan was followed, or separation, so I agreed to it, not wanting to give up on us yet without having tried everything I could.

He justified it by saying he needs a situation where he has the complete control of me since he did not trust me anymore, so he is positive about a relationship with me, but since he hates me after that, he does not want to be in the position to approach me, and do anything to influence his naturally developed feelings.

Since then followed more than a year of bad moods, arguing unlogical, and treating me like I have no right to speak up at all. It was so bad he would be angry at the tiniest things like me standing in his way, or passing him a can the wrong way. It was not like I would totally back down, I tried to be not treated too badly, but in his opinion, he was totally justified treating me like he wanted. He was even angry at me for having confirmed his contract in the beginning and not completely following it afterwards.

One year passed and then another

We always argue a lot, arguing itself, (not) showing respect, etc.
(As one example: issues like porn have always been a big deal;not showing respect for my feelings or lying to me lead to me feeling disrespected and ignored

Our relationship developed constantly over the time, begins to like me again, and that he behaves nicer than before (except for during conflicts). He also thinks his plan is finally working, and it only needed so long for developing, because we constantly fought during the years, that he could never really develop any positive feelings for me. He would have needed me to completely follow his instructions, and not let fights happen even if I was unhappy. He could only develop a positive attitude if there was some time constantly positive between us. 

So now it seems there has enough time passed that his feelings naturally changed, because I got to know him over the years as such a bad, unappealing, angry person I do not trust, so I am not sure yet, if he really changed and let his behavior behind. All the time I rethink if he lies to me, has an agenda. He admits today that he behaved badly, and that it may have been the wrong way to work on our (his?) problem. Every time I mention that I disagreed to our 'contract' from beginning on, so there was no way to handle it differently. 

I tried to make him realize how this time destroyed my appreciation of him. But he blames me for not having an objective view on him
But my problem is, he has been right and there is no doubt about it. I Feel like I am with a lunatic. I even come up with the idea, he might use the original incident as an excuse to behave this way since it gave him all the control. 

So I wonder about Reddits opinion of my conclusions. Was it the right way to deal with the feeling the other cheated on him? What would you have suggested
Any productive comment and advice will be appreciated.

1339659048.0,v1cdi,I feel like my GF(19) and I are drifting apart.,hopelessfirstpost,13,3,8,"I am 20(Male) and we have been together for well over a year now. She has really been my only true GF as I was not the most loved in high school. Ive done things that any previous BF of hers could say they have not. She has gone through many problems in the year I have been with her

Recently, seeing movies, going to the beach or just hang out. We always had problems figuring out what we were going to do. If we ever did, we would just meet each other at one anothers house. Recently though, that has not become an option.

Why has it not become an option? Because my GF seems to have fallen to an addiction to a social networking site. She does not work during the day most times, she sits on her phone. She spends all her time on said website. 

She never offers up her house as an option to do stuff anymore, which is hard cause she is a very talkative person. It almost seems as if I have done something wrong. Sometimes, she even tells me to go watch TV in a separate area so that she can have some time on the computer alone and that she doesn't want me to sit by her cause it would be ""awkward."" Back when we first started going out, her parents would tell me I had to leave around 10pm so that I wouldn't disrupt there sleep(they both work super early). That did not matter to her though, I would almost always stay till 11 or so. Now, I am leaving at 10 cause her parents say so. She makes sure that I leave right after 10. She claims she does not want to get in trouble but she does not care to be in trouble by her parents, or at least she didn't. Again

She is constantly lieing to me as well. I have a little bit of knowledge has to how to find some things on the internet and I found her page on the social networking site that she is constantly on. The last couple of weeks she has been saying she is going to sleep, not to long ago, we were at her relatives house and she was on her phone browsing her favorite site again. Then, I saw her log out and log back in with the regular email address she uses. I question her if she has two accounts, she says ""No."" and gives me this story about how it always freezes and logs her out after waiting a while so she just logs out herself so she doesn't have to wait. At the time, it seemed like a legitimate thing. Then, I see her signing in with a completely different email then her regular. I remember this email and sure enough, she was pretending to be a character from a movie. I know it may not seem like a big thing

My next issue. Her addiction to the social networking site basically consists of her sitting on her phone all day looking at men she finds super attractive or pretending to be those men on a separate account. Basically, when she is constantly talking about him with me. Ive always been the jealous type. She says things like ""Have my babies"" ""Just marry me already"" ""Im your future wife"" ""I want you to take baths with me"" and the most killer of all """"Just have sex with me already"" These are things she used to say to me. 

The main reason why I feel like I am being replaced and why we are growing farther apart is because it seems like she no longer loves me. She says the words ""I love you"" but at times they seem empty and meaningless. She no longer does the things with me that she used too. Any time we were at her house, or whatever. Now, she hardly even gives me hugs. When I leave her house at night, she kisses me but they much like the words I love you, feeling meaningless. Any time we fool around, I generally have to do all the work. She hardly touches me. She only does so if I tease her where as usually she just does it. 

Also

All these reasons, I keep replaying in my head what would happen if I was to break up with her. As mentioned at the start, she has gone through quite a bit of problems in the year I have been dating her. Before our trip, it really hit her hard. She would wake up many days and just not be happy. She couldn't figure out for the life of her, why. After almost all of her incidents, she never chose to pursue any help except for one time, which she only did cause she was forced too. I think she has some sort of depression but I told her no matter what I would still love her. She still to this day refuses help, I feel like if I was to break it off

I need help. I need help with my relationship. I'm hoping that it will fade off but it has been almost a month now and nothing is changing. Has it sailed its course?

**tl;dr** My gf seems to have lost interest in me. I believe its cause of a social networking site. She posts things about a celebrity that she used to say to me. No longer does affectionate things with me. Prefers time with website then with me.  She does no work in ""fooling around."" I feel as if she no longer loves me,,False,,t5_2sa5c,False,,True

Things seemed to be getting better when one day she told me she was leaving

Now we are in April. She actually moved back in at the beginning of the month. This is after many moments of her wanting to be together( sometimes even ""dating"" for a month or so) and then wanting to be apart. We have both been to much therapy together and on our own. Last week she said she felt she needed to leave. 

Right now my wife is also dealing with bulimia. I did not know about it earlier than a month and a half ago and she did not accept it until then either. The therapist we have seen together said that my wife dissociates

So last week after a visit to her eating disorder counselor she came home and said she wanted to leave. I don't get angry or confrontational in these moments because I know this wouldn't help her ""flight"" feeling. I am patient and understanding and keep telling her and showing her that I am here for her. By the end of the week things were good with her telling me she feels safe with me and that I truly am the man for her. I had a very troubled childhood and she keeps calling me ""My lotus flower"" for everything I have made it through and what I have become.

Everything was going great yesterday, today is another day."" And texts saying that she loves me. Fast forward to when I get home from work, after she has seen the bulimia counselor again, my wife is back to saying she wants to leave. Unfortunately I was not able to be strong this time and I broke down. I cried. I am hurt, I am extremely exhausted and I don't know if I am grasping onto something that just might not be there. She says she knows I'm a great guy and that I probably am good for her, but she doesn't know if she can be good for me, or be her with me. She feels she either has to put herself full on into ""Us"" or she can't do anything at all. She likes her extremes.

So here are the levels of a relationship (I'm kinda bullshitting is part as I go)

1.) connection - you find a person you can connect with share experiences together

2.) relationship (eh, you know they are your significant other 

3.) sex (might somewhat depend, (or at least I hope not.) 

4.) teamwork, they help you. You get the other three levels mixed in and you got a great relationship. You are made a better person by them. You teach each other and share great experiences, pool together money to go to the opera house or football game. They aren't there just for a connection (dude, I like volleyball too we should date!) or to have somebody to make them feel loved (I told you I had a girlfriend, see?) or for the rush of sex (glorified fuck buddies). This person is there to care for you as much as you re them. They say there is a lot of fish in the sea, but the right fish is difficult to spot.

* **not asking me about my day.** For example, he specifically doesn't ask the question back because he knows they're ""fishing for a chance to talk"" and that they should just say up front if they have something to talk about.

I am a 21 year old male currently in college who has been without a relationship for exactly a year as of this week. My last breakup was with a [29] year old woman at my workplace who had extreme bipolar issues... I was head-over-heels for her though

Just this week

Since my last breakup, my college career, my personal freedom, etc. I am utterly annoyed by these new girls desperate for boyfriends who constantly text me and say nice things to me, cause I feel like I was once desperate for love too. But I have no desire to date or flirt with these girls who don't interest me both visually and personally.

My friends/family think I'm being a bit ridiculous by hesitating to give anymore girls who flirt with me a ""chance"" or a few dates to like them. I get the feeling though that all these girls want is someone to mooch on and get laid by

My question for all of you is: Is it OK to not be interested in dating/sexual relationships till after college or until I grow up a little? How do I decline opportunities to date nice women who just don't interest me from the getgo? I desire a pretty woman who has career ambitions rather than these coworkers that pursue me because they are lazy and have no career ambitions outside of having kids and working a low wage job.

Recently

My girlfriend absolutely loves the feeling of ""new"" and excitement that comes from the unexpected in a new dating situation. I want to keep giving that to her despite my moves being a little tired and old. Let me be a bit more specific in saying that, hugs, and caresses. The not knowing aspect.

My initial thought was perhaps a good bridge to that was to work on my flirting skills; admittedly I have none to very little. But perhaps there are some other ways. I have never been much of a Dominant per say but I can play the part

The other side to that, or to let her have her space. I am terrible at reading that. Of late I need to make sure within all this that I respect her boundaries during the times that she really needs to just be alone. I know your first instinct is to say ""ask"" her and communicate, but I want to make it seem not forced you know? I don't want it to be like... ""oh hey, can i flirt with you today? How's that feeling?""

A few questions then:

1. How can I better Flirt with her and turn it into a good habit? (resources?)
2. What kinds of little things can I do to show her my appreciation outside of ""turning her on"" flirting?
3. How can I make sure I keep the effort up? 

I am hoping this drives a really good discussion as I am open to many ideas.

Forgive me

I've been dating this girl for a couple months, we were having a good time together, but she wanted it more than I did and I probably just pushed her away. Well last weekend, after a week of not seeing each other, we had dinner to talk things out and we had an amazing time. We had a serious and at times emotional conversation during which, she confessed to getting drunk and making out with some guy. I was pissed, but our relationship was never that serious, that night she stays with me and we've both expressed our determination to give it a real shot. Yay! Then I can't get a hold of her all weekend. I was out of town, thought maybe she lost her phone anything.

The entire weekend goes by and she finally responds to me on Monday morning and tells me that not only has she been ignoring me

I was feeling crushed, betrayed, but intellectually I knew it was probably for the best anyway. Never makes it hurt any less.

So I spent the evening going for a run and then

I think I handled it pretty well. I told him that I loved him and would always be there for him

I felt (and still feel) that her family pressured her to end the relationship and seek someone better than myself without considering her feelings. She recently acknowledged that sentiment and has started revisiting our relationship regardless of her families opinions.

For about two months she wouldn't talk to me, and make reparations. These amends included; sitting down with her father, aunt, sister and friends face to face and telling him them whole story of what happened, why, and how sorry I was. I also made significant improvements (therapy, keeping a job long term, maintaining financial stability) to better my own life and by extension the life of my significant other. 

My ex eventually came around and we started talking again. To my absolute delight and amazement we had drinks and watched a movie at my place yesterday. I am thrilled to have the privilege of rebuilding our friendship and hopefully a relationship. 

There is definitely a some sexual tension between us. She and I had a fantastic sex life

1340005111.0,v7s74,Possibly in love with online friend... what do I do?,wilcolover,10,1,15,"I'm new to reddit and am not entirely sure if this fits here

A few years ago I met someone online totally by random chance and we immediately hit it off. We started emailing, ambitions, secrets, etc, talking for hours at a time, often late into the night, even to the point of occasionally forming our RL plans around our cyber chats. We have always felt like we can tell the other absolutely anything, even though this friendship is strictly online. I have never experienced a friendship like this, funny, independent

A few complications: I am 18 and he is 28. We don't live in the same country. We have totally separate lives, I think sometimes the conversation has become borderline flirty (then again, this might just be me WANTING it to be flirty), he calls me beautiful and an amazing person quite often, and I feel very sure that he feels the strong connection we have, but for all I know, this is just him being incredibly sweet

So I'm not looking for tips to reel him in or anything like that. I have absolutely no clue how to control my own feelings, and I think there is a good chance it will happen within the next year, if a good opportunity presents itself. I have been toying with the idea of telling him how I feel when we do meet up, but this idea also terrifies me. Even if he somehow, by some stroke of magic, feels the same way, our lives are so separate that it would be near impossible to simply be together. If he does not feel the same way, I will almost assuredly ruin an amazing friendship by making it uncomfortable as fuck for him

I also worry that if I never tell him how I feel and just keep it bottled up, and I don't want to commit to someone else while I'm thinking about another guy in this way.

So yeah. This is my predicament, and maybe get some advice that I had not previously thought of. Any perspective, male or female, young or old, is appreciated!!

Basically, ex, mutual friend, acquaintance)?

Strong feelings meaning more than a crush. Possibly love.

Possible answers:

-I would feel angry because my SO should have feelings for only me

-I would feel indifferent because my SO can't control his or her emotions

-I would feel worthless because there must be something wrong with me

-I would feel happy because we are poly-amorous and I'd be happy for him/her

etc.

Would this be a deal-breaker in your relationship? (Would you break up with your SO because of this?)

Would it make a difference if your SO was close with this person and remained close with him/her after developing these feelings?

Personally, I would understand that humans are not always in control of their emotions and it is normal to be able to have feelings for more than one person. I would logically understand and not think it's a huge deal. But emotionally, I would go ape-shit and feel worthless. It would be a deal-breaker if my SO remained close to the person after telling me.

I was just concerned about a few things regarding etiquette. I think I should get her a nice gift for letting us stay with her and buying our plane tickets, or if someone invites you to their house you bring flowers or some food - you never come empty-handed). In his family, they don't really care about those things. I feel like if I bring a gift from home, it might come off as sucking up and she'll feel like she has to pay it back through the trip.

She has been trying really hard to get over him. There was a party and she tried flirting with a guy she met recently. She told me he rejected her but was very sweet and told her that the reason why he didn't want her was that ""she's too great"" and that they had  become close friends in a short period of time and he didn't want to ruin that.

I am a heterosexual guy



Hey guys and gals, as you see fit. I am sick and tired of the concept of friendzone and forever alone. I know what it is like to be in the friendzone and be forever alone. There are guys out there(and possibly girls idk) who are madly in love with their ""best friend"". We think about you every day. Multiple times a day. We think about what we can say and how to say it so that you like us better. Every night we play through how to get you to like us. For years on end we are like this. We want you to need us. We need you to want us. We might know it is possible to live without you, but our heart cant accept that. We don't know what we would do if you were to tell us you don't want to ruin our friendship. Ruin our friendship? Really? We spend every waking moment thinking of you and we spend every night dreaming of you. We are grateful for every minute that we get to spend with you. But this isn't friendship. No it isn't. We wallow in our self pity and despair over our indecision to bring up this subject. The world won't break if our friendship does, but our hearts will. You value our friendship too much to risk a relationship? Are you fucking crazy? We'll make you happy **forever**. 


This is how I feel when I think about all of you guys(and probably girls) who are out there in the friendzone. I feel you. The people we're in love with
I get angry thinking about all the guys out there who are absolutely miserable in the friendzone, but I would like it if we could discuss everyone's feelings on this concept of forever alone and friend zones.

1364372620.0,1b3mqz,Schrodinger's Feelings: An analysis of romantic interests within a friendship.,Shiek568,14,7,2,"**Your mind can help you in unexpected ways sometimes. When a situation arises where any sort of analysis would have negative consequences

*I have found myself recently in a strange situation recently and I decided to dissect it into the actual feelings at play and distill its essence into a single explanation. I am a science student and so have written it in the form of a classic experimental report.For reference


**Situation:** Having recently met a rather incredible woman

**Development:** Having known almost immediately that she was unavailable, I’m readily available to help her through any sort of emotional turmoil she might be experiencing and she is also willing to reciprocate. We enjoy each other’s company and are even planning to get an apartment together for college the coming year (third year, in case of future reference).

**The Problem:**
Someone looking at us sees how close we are and may immediately assume that we are a couple (which isn't the case). She is in a happy relationship and I am perfectly aware and accepting of that. I am not in a relationship (nor have I ever been in one), yet it hasn’t happened… Why?

**Analysis:**
Usually in cases such as this I obsess and analyse the relationship until I either have a satisfactory answer or drive myself a little more insane than I already am. This time however nothing of the sort happened.
My own ideals, fucking things up for me.
There is also the point that more than just me could get hurt in this situation. I would end up hurting myself to be sure
What seem to have occurred are any romantic feelings I may or may not have at the moment for her are being blocked from the analytical section of my mind

**Speculation:** While there is no analysis currently underway in the proverbial box, or if there is there is actually anything occurring there at all!
Analysis of it would inevitably cause the dissolution of the friendship as it is at any rate

**Results:** I have decided to call this phenomenon “Schrodinger’s Feelings” in homage to the Schrodinger’s Cat principle that this is so similar to . To my mind at this point there are certain criteria that have to be fulfilled in order for a situation to be described as such…
	The romantic interest must be in a committed relationship

	The interested party must have ideals similar to the ones described above where the possibility of “stealing her” is out of the question.

	A relationship of another sort has blossomed out of initial contact (e.g. friendship)

Limits have also been imagined as to when the box may be opened

	She specifically asks you to and is in an emotionally sound state to be able to make such a decision. E.g. cannot happen immediately post break-up or during a fight.

	A cross-roads is reached in the life of either party where the only (or most preferable) way to continue on is to open it.

	A situation comes about whereupon there is nothing left to lose from opening it. E.g.  The friendship has ended with no possibility or reconciliation; or she makes it perfectly clear that there is absolutely no romantic interest on her part.

**Discussion:** People seeing us label me as being in the “friend-zone”. This may be perfectly true, the odds are slightly in favour of my having such feelings for her, but there is still the possibility of romantic indifference on my part.
At this point we both seem content in keeping our relationship as is

I should also note that i only used myself and herself as examples here. In reality there's no reason the gender roles can't be reversed,False,,t5_2sa5c,False,,,t3_1b3mqz

While I checked these accounts there was no activities but it really hurt me.

I started dating this girl who lives in another city recently.  Met at a wedding, and things have been going really well.  We have the same sense of humor and just seem super compatible, a lot in common, great chemistry.  At the risk of sounding ridiculous, the metaphor of fitting together like two puzzle pieces has been used.

So anyway, and then she came to see me a month later for the weekend.  That first month apart seemed pretty reasonable, but after she came to visit, I couldn't stand it.  We weren't supposed to see each other for another month until New Year's, but after a week and a half, I called her on Tuesday and told her to come see me and she bought a plane ticket for that Friday.  And then, the two weeks between when she left and when I went to see her for New Year's took AGES.  We talked on the phone for like 800 minutes the week before I got there, that definitely didn't happen.

So anyway, I can't get anything done at work because I'm just thinking about her all the time.  I have been trying to go to bed early but when I try to go to sleep at night my brain won't stop and at this point I'm super exhausted from lack of sleep.  I can't focus on my real life because I'm just thinking about when I'll see her again.  I've got it bad.  It's like an addiction.  I'm going to visit in a week but right now I'm just looking at how much a plane ticket tonight will cost me, despite having plans to go hang out with friends tonight and needing to take care of some stuff at home.

And I know I can't complain at all because there are people in LDR across continents and months.  We're fortunate because we can afford to come visit each other every two weeks.  But I can barely handle being apart for days.  It's so ridiculous.

We both have non-relocatable job committments and leases until the summer, which is probably a bad career move.  I've also thought about just breaking it off because I don't think I can tolerate how I feel when we separate again.  I'm just obsessing.

Now don't get me wrong

The problem is that she is simply not a good dog owner in my opinion. Her dog (Labradoodle) is very dumb, she doesn't say ""DOWN"" she just yells the dog's name and shoves it off. The dog really has no idea what just happened except that its human yelled and pushed it, but without a command, it can't know why. So that behavior will certainly be repeated. 

Also just a lot of other things that, and that is hard for me to be around.

Now we both have kids, because they are a package deal. Does this rule apply to animals too? Obviously when I go to her house I will have to be around this situation, but suddenly this is in MY house, and I am not dealing with it very well .

I am not really sure how to bring this up with her. I think it would come off as a real dick-move to say ""Hey don't bring your dog over""

This post is about the term “toxic relationships”. Thankfully, in my opinion, why using this term to describe a relationship does more harm then it does good. 

**What is toxic?**

When I think of the word toxic, or an egg salad sandwich that has been sitting out in the sun far too long. I think of things that when they are consumed, inhaled, or touched, they cause harm to the body. This harm that causes us harm is one sided. If you eat rat poison by mistake, there is no way to get revenge on the poison. You either find an antidote, wait till the effects go away, a toxic item  does direct damage to a person without prejudice or judgment. Most importantly

**Why is it a bad term to describe relationships?**

I believe that there are many reasons why this is a bad term and one of those is that it is a word with shock value. When we her someone use the term toxic relationship, and solved by a simple term. 

We all know, that nothing can ever be so simple to define. Relationships are complex and constantly evolving and if we use such a simple and broad term to describe why a relationship is failing, we are not being fair to the people involved or the relationship itself. 
For example, but why tiptoe around what kind of relationship it is. It isn't toxic, its a physically abusive relationship with an alcoholic. 

On the flip-side, but he does get angry at her crying. Some people would say this is toxic for Linda. But wait,  the issue is deeper then that. Perhaps Linda cries easily because she is frustrated and angry with Jim, and wants to talk it out but she does not know how. This is what she has learned to do when she gets upset. The same is true for Jim. Maybe he isn't getting angry at Linda but perhaps he is angry at himself because he does not know how to approach this situation. He just has not learned the best way to deal with either his or Linda's emotions. 

I know the situations are quite sexist

**So what do we do?**

The bad thing is, but I think when someone comes in and asks for advice, they are not looking for specifics on how to solve a problem, but a different point of view. We may say specific things based on very tiny pieces of one-sided information, but the intent is to make the person asking for answers to think from different points of view. I guess it is my intent that this rant is directed at how we view relationships in the real world. Some of this may rollover into how we help others on Reddit, and that would be great.

He tends to make a lot of friendships with girls. That's fine, or talk about bitches they want to fuck. He likes to have girlfriends because they're more interesting and like to do stuff, or just sit around and talk. I just feel like he gets way too intimate with girls and their personal lives. I know, that's what friendships are, but almost all of the girls he's been friends with have developed feelings for them. I'll tell him that, but he claims they don't, or that he doesn't see it.

Whenever he makes friends with a girl he is constantly talking to them, spending literally all of his free time with them, texting them, anything else you could think of. I think girls like him so much because he's kind of a sensitive guy. He truly cares about people, and girls loves venting to nice guys who seem to care. The problem is that i'm not really ok with all of it. It comes to the point where girls have called him in the middle of the night because she ""had a nightmare"". And the same girl claimed she was raped by someone and needed my boyfriend to go with her to the doctor to get tested for diseases. All after only knowing him for a couple months.

Also, I got drunk and three way kissed my best girlfriend, and some guy. So I understand why he would stop caring about things that bothered me, but I thought that we were trying to move on from that since he had told me he still wanted to be with me, was going to try to forgive me and move forward. I don't use that as an excuse, I know what I did was wrong. But he should have ended it if he was going to stop caring or trying.
Anyways he is an awesome person, or if it's ok to feel unspecial by his behavior?

So basically she was my first real relationship and she started treating me pretty poorly after about 6 months (once a strong connection has already been made), i use to cry etc on her doorstep begging for her to come back and she use to tell me to fuck off etc etc.. sigh.

After the honeymoon phase of the relationship (~1 year) and i started to get sick of how she was treating me, etc trust me, whenever i asked other people for advice they were like yeah overreaction). This in turn actually worked out well, she started to clean up her act and treat me a lot better. But, basically i guess i ran out of juice. I became really numb to it all, not really caring and eventually the relationship deteriorated. It was a combination of uni stress, family, I just couldn't handle it so i broke up with her. I never spoke to other girls

So I recovered, but i eventually got us to the stage where we're ""taking it slow"". But we are spooning again and kissing etc etc

In my head I want to rebuild it slowly the way it should've been. I am way better now, then yes etc. So she is confused, I know she doesn't really trust me. I know she is just afraid of getting hurt. When i text her too much she just completely shrugs me off, like she plays hard to get? I saw her today and she started bringing up old problems we use to have and it got weird, but earlier in the day it was all happy while watching tv together etc. I know if I keep texting her she'll just say no, so i'll leave it for a few days and see if she comes back to me. I know, it's games

I know it would be easier to just start with somebody else, maybe your points of view may make it easier

1337872895.0,u2us5,Some advice for the short guys out there.,ShabbySheik,10,1,4,"I just posted this as a response

As a fellow short man at 24Y.O., and a baby face... I feel your pain.

There isn't much you really can do about your height physically, so why worry about the ones who disregard you simply because you're short? You wouldn't be happy in a relationship with that type of girl.

As with both genders, hair color, skin tone, etc. I'm sure you've met some girls who were drop dead gorgeous but after hearing them speak or seeing how they act/treat others, you want nothing to do with them. And on the other end of the spectrum; I'm sure you've met girls who weren't that attractive but had phenomenal personalities that won you over.

So what you can work on is being an awesome guy. What is an awesome guy? Whatever the hell you want it to be. In my opinion, respectful, witty, interesting, and I'm almost always smiling.

I usually don't bring up my height ever in conversation, even if it's the only reason why a girl shot you down is the worst thing you can do about it. More women will think of it as a problem if you make it out to be one.

As for what you can do physically about yourself; there are a few things you can be mindful of. Personal hygiene and image is extremely important. Take care of your hair, try to keep an acne free face (I have had some serious issues with it before and I have to wash my face 2-3 times a day to avoid break outs), be clean shaven or have some form of maintenanced facial hair. Be mindful of what scent you use for shampoo, conditioner (if you use that), and deodorant. I never wear cologne, but women tell me I smell great more often than not (All I wear is Old Spice Swagger.)

You can obviously work out to look better

Posture is extremely important (women, keep your eyes up as opposed to looking at the ground, tilt your head back slightly, hold your shoulders back ever so slightly, and don't have your hands in your front pockets (it causes you to hunch over.) To get an idea how what you should be going for, stand up against a wall. Your heels, butt, and the back of your head should all touch the wall.

Wear nice clothes. Your clothing greatly affects your initial impression on people. /r/malefashionadvice can help, try not to have super baggy sleeves. It makes your arms look smaller, and just looks off. Dark wash, slim fit jeans are great for just about any non-formal occasion. Don't wear tennis shoes unless you're actually playing a sport. There are plenty of semi-casual shoes that are comfortable, and look good. I've recently discovered Henley shirts and I love them. Long sleeves, but pushing them up your arms almost to your elbows seems to be a thing for a lot of women.

I can't boast and say I take home a girl every weekend

**TL;DR - Don't dwell on the fact that you're short. Be mindful of your appearance and clothing. Hygiene is extremely important. And for the love of whatever you may or may not worship

Now my question is...he moved away back to his family a month ago.  We have not really talked since the time it happened (that is probably not very healthy).  I am close with his mom, I don't want to see him but his family thinks I should.

I can't do this any more.

I know that this relationship isn't right for me. I can feel it in my guts, from getting into the relationship in the first place, over not standing up for myself when boundaries were defined, to keeping my feelings to myself once I started realising that it wasn't going to work out. I should never have let her move in; I should never have let her get a cat; I should never have backed down all the times where she threatened to leave. I should stop telling her I love her, when I know in my heart that that's not really true any more. All I can say in my defence is that I'm weak, and I'm scared, and I'm indecisive. But no more.

I've done some things right at least. I have tried to talk to her about my dissatisfaction, or let somebody else get something that she didn't choose to get. Sometimes things will get better after I bring them up, that is true. But while we talk about them, she will never agree to change anything, or find some compromise; she'll be like a rock, saying, “No, makes me grumpy

I don't want to make it sound like there are no good times. There are plenty of good times, where did the time go – if there weren't good times. Or so I keep telling myself. When things are good, they're great. When things are bad, they're bad, but they're not atrocious and horrible. That's not why I'm breaking up with her; maybe if it were the case, I wouldn't have dithered so long. It's not the intensity of the bad times that makes me want to break up; it's the recurrence, and the knowledge that they will never go away. I don't know if I used to think that they would

What do I want? That I don't know; and who could say after their first relationship that they know exactly what they want? Maybe I want somebody who's less headstrong, less traumatic family life. Maybe I want somebody who's more supportive of my interests, or gets along better with my friends. Heck, maybe I even want somebody fitter with bigger boobs. It doesn't really matter right now what I want in my next relationship. What matters is that I no longer want this one.

I've been a coward, us, the relationship. I've not seen the warning signs; her lack of friends, her inability to stick to anything, her bad work ethic, her inexplicable mood changes. That's not true; I did see them, I just didn't act on them. I didn't break it off when she threw a tantrum the first time I wanted to take an evening to work instead of meeting with her. I didn't break it off when cooking together became a chore rather than something I love doing, when she got irrationally jealous of my female friends, and neither did I stand up for myself

Well, and I know what I need to do. It'll be painful for both of us, but I have to break up with her. We live together, we have the aforementioned cat together; it's clear that it's going to be tricky and time-consuming to disentangle our lives. It's not fair to her, and not fair to me, but neither is staying in a dead-end relationship, one that I know she wants to take further, but I know I'll be okay. I hope she will be too. I may not love her any more, that there's no way I can give even an ounce of ground on the break up issue

This is why I'm posting this. You people will help keep me sane, followed by updates every week until the relationship is truly over.

**What it was:**

She and I met in graduate school last August.  We hit it off immediately and became very close friends very fast.  When she broke up with her boyfriend in December

So for the first two months it was basically perfect.  We hung out, etc. etc.  Around the 3 month mark she told me she loved me and I said the same.  I'd never fallen in love so fast.  That was about a month ago, ish.

Last week we took a trip together, about the pictures I took constantly, etc. etc.  I thought about breaking up.  But I love her and figured we could work through it.

Then tonight I came over here to her place and she said she didn't love me anymore and that she didn't see this working.  She had a few minor things about me that bugged her, like she's a little self-centered (she agrees), and so on.

And then we cuddled on her bed and bawled our eyes out for a few hours

**What went wrong:**

We both found things about the other that irritated us

I was guilty of the same crime.  I didn't tell her that I expected more from her in terms of support

That wasn't all.  I loved taking care of her when she was down or stressed, she felt like she wasn't accomplishing anything and so ceased to take pride in her work.  That's not a good thing.  And I felt my aid to her was going unreciprocated, which made me feel unappreciated.

First, there's your problem, moron"", but I don't see it as a problem. From what I've observed, many relationships simply ""happen"" without too much effort from the girl or guy. I don't put women on a pedastool, thinking that I must humble myself before them. I also don't see them as some object to be claimed and won. Im looking for another PERSON to be intimate with and to share ( or entertain and criticize!) my values.

I'm not one to give myself compliments (again, either after the fact or from another person, so I don't think it's my looks. And I've largely gotten over my fear of girls which, I admit, didn't really dissolve until 10th grade. I exercise, wash regularly, and look clean. Not preppy or ""overly-done"". Just, me.

I didn't really want to be in a relationship in high school, I've taken notice of a few girls who seem pretty, smart and genuine. Combine this with my introversion, and you've got a wanting, lonely result. I've noticed that my desire for a relationship is increasing, and I almost feel WRONG for feeling this way. I've always been attracted to girls, but I've never actually wanted to pursue a relationship with most of them (one super-crush-esque fantasy being an exception.

It seems like the norm is for the guy to be older and I know some of you are wondering about dating older women.  I thought I would share some tips on a relationship with older woman for guys.  I by no means an expert so let me know if my tips make sense or if you have anything you would like to add.  These are my tips with my single experience dating an older women

* It is possible to become friends first and then start dating (It was harder

* Generally, that helps you find capability much quicker then younger daters.  I was 26 when I started dating a 31 year old female, but I knew what I was looking for in a long term relationship after dating other people before I met this woman.  I just felt younger women (In their 20s) still wanted to ""experience"" things more before even getting into a long term relationship.

* When you first start talking

* Just because they are older doesn't mean their interests are going to be drastically different than yours.  As in any relationship

* Again through research and observation

Stage 1 - Hormone love: This is gaga teenage love. It's real. It's intense. It's inexplicable. Maybe the person is ""hot, or the right clothes, or is just super friggin' cool for an inexplicable reason. It's fleeting though. Any divergence from the abstract pedestal conception of the person (say they do something annoying) can shatter this love. 

Stage 2 - Choice love. There are still elements of hormonal love, judgments, intelligence, etc. You both really love each other's company, and there is less ""my beauty is augmented by my association with the beauty of my partner."" It may also lack the ""emotional intensity"" of hormonal love, but is more stable.

Stage 3 - Sacrificial love. This is more like the parent/child love, compassion, attention, kindness, etc. The parts of the other that may frustrate, annoy, anger you, who lends supports to others. Their joy is your joy and vice versa. Their suffering is your opportunity to serve.

Stage 4 - Spiritual love. This love is an all-encompassing

I have known this guy since Gr. 11 (5-6 years ago). Back in high school we were more friends of friends. We were in the same computers class and liked similar things. Never really thought much of him back then. Once high school graduated and I joined League of Legends with friends, since we lived far away and we never hung out in person, I never thought anything of it. 

Just recently though

But here is the problem: He does not think any girl would be interested in him. He has some form of autism which doesn't really help his social actions. It is like a shell he has built over himself to protect himself from not needing a girl. I have no clue how to approach him on this! I feel any subtly would be classified as joking around ('cause she couldn't obviously be flirting with me'). I don't think saying 'we should go out sometime' will have much affect either.

After being someone's rebound for a month and a half, and I ended up fooling myself into thinking I was in love with this girl. We spent many nights at each others' places and many hours talking to each other on the phone. There was a deep connection there. Her reasons for breaking up with me were because I was graduating college and she was not. At one point she said that further down the line we could try again. She still wanted to keep me around as a friend though

Looking back on things, went to the gym, took photos, and went out with my friends. But after the break up she kept calling me to hang out, and because I was so lonely I would concede. I couldn't stand the idea that for her I was absolutely nothing, just one of many relationships she had started and ended, where for me this was the biggest event of my entire life up until this point. No one had ever cared, about me beforehand. Not even my parents. Eventually

I find that this cycle of friendship/almost relationship/debased friendship is something that I have fallen into time and time again in my life and I don't know what to do about it. I'm 22 and should have learned by now. In many ways I feel as though I was conditioned this way by my emotionally abusive mother. I have no idea how to stop this cycle from repeating itself.

____________________________________________________________________________________________


Me[F23] and my boyfriend [23] have been together for 4 years
From the beginning I noticed that he is very dependent on someone running his life. I liked being in charge of that until it started bugging me about 9 months ago. I've been thinking and talking about it a lot


My problems with him:

- He only does chores when I explicitly tell him to and remind him a couple of times (like a child)

- He forgets to eat when I don't make food - like a child (thats a problem because he wants to gain weight and I want to lose it

- He is extremely lazy

- He interrupts me when I talk and sometimes tells my punchline (all wrong might I add!). I almost freak out when this happens because for me it's a clear sign of lacking respect (his father does interrupt bf's mother all the time and generally is not respecting women at all)


My problems with myself:

- Everyone (but me) seems to think that I'm the reacher and he's the settler (HIMYM anyone?)

- I seem to be incapable to change things on my own

- I don't have many friends and have no idea how to find some

- I've never had a charming personality and have no idea how to change that. You know the kind: introvert, everyone loves him after ten seconds. I am green with envy because it's so easy for him.)


Our problems with each other:

- I love talking about theories (almost doesn't matter which field it is from: life in general, psychology...) and try to analyse our relationship a lot(reacher-settler, the concept of soulmates, fate...) or the ones of mine/his parents to avoid traps and improve our everyday life. His opinion about that kind of stuff is 'that's all nonsense' (no discussion). So I talk to my Mom about it and he then gets mad 'because I'm talking crap again'.

- I want to experience life

- I want my life to be exciting and I want to travel the world, ...

- I want to move to a different country after graduation and if I don't like it



My problem in general is that I feel very old and 'set in my ways' and I'm afraid I'll miss the best time of my life. (Because we never moved away from home seperately

I suspect that I'm projecting some of my flaws and fears onto him so I don't have to blame myself if something fails. I really would appreciate some opinions and maybe some advice on any of my 99 problems.

1362730988.0,19wif5,[23m] Girls that return my interest in them treat me like a cure for their imperfect relationship,dreizunull,11,2,4,"I have the following problem which I simply cannot resolve by myself.
After my last girlfriend with whom I have been together for 2 years has dumped me (which was 2 years ago) anytime I show interest in a girl and it's mutual they treat me as a cure for the problems that occur in their relationships. Let me elaborate:

1. First girl. Let's call her A. I met her during an univeristy lecture. We quickly hit it off pretty well. We really enjoyed each others company. About a month into our acquaintance I have found out she has a boyfriend. I was shocked because her behaviour stated otherwise. I tried to back down (I even told her that) but it happened so that she asked me to come to another lecture to meet with here. And from there things went crazy. I often came to her flat where we snuggled (several times we've done that in my car because of her roommates). I felt terrible but I went on. She often brought up the problems she had with her boyfriend (apparently I was able to make her horny but not him - and not only that). When I finally gathered courage to tell her that she has to choose she broke down crying and our relationship broke off soon after that.

2. Girl B. I've known her for a relatively long time. I've even been told several times that we should be together because we would make a good couple (even though she's conservative Christian and I'm an atheist). I knew she had a boyfriend and I did not want to repeat what has just happened. But I did. On multiple occassions she criticised her boyfriend and complained about his behaviour - he is the least ambitious person I've ever known. When he finally saw that their relationship is going downhill he proposed to her parents (who agreed). Then she was torn between me and him. When I firmly asked her to make a decision she went to the guy to break up with him. She came back with a handwritten letter which stated that although I am a good person she does not love me and wants to be with her boyfriend till the end of the world.

3. Girl C. I met her about a year ago. Suddenly she messaged me that we should hang out sometime. I agreed. We had a good time and we decided that we should meet again. Then I found out that she has a boyfriend. I did not hesitate to break off the contact. Naturally

I am quite ambitious person. I try to get the best grades at uni. I work part time. I help fellow students with classes. I partake in extracurricular activities. I am not handsome nor ugly, squats and on weekends I hit the gym (though I'm not athletic - my lifestyle makes it hard to organise a well balanced diet). 

I don't understand why it's happening to me. It's making my self-esteem so low that I have really dark thoughts. I stopped believing that any woman will ever want to be with me. What should I/can I do to avoid situations like that?

tl;dr Each time I hook up with a girl I find out that's she's with a piece of a trash boyfriend. When I ask them to make a decision they always choose the boyfriend over me. Also

Anywho, the girl who I went to prom with senior year in highschool constantly was talking/flirting to me online, which she learned about. Although my SO is a really cute girl, this other girl I went to prom with is also very cute. My SO constantly compares herself to prom girl and sees herself as insignificant compared to her. She recently had an incident at a party where, well, I guess copypasting her facebook status describes how she felt the best...

""when guys want to sleep with you, free weed and you'll never get called for elbows when playing beer pong. when you're a ""cool girl"" you get to stay sober at parties and make sure no one kills themselves. looks like i need to re-evaluate my life choices, time to break out the push-up bras and vagina-length skirts""

Because of what happened in the past (I told the prom girl to fuck off about 6-7 months ago, constantly self-berating and lacking confidence in herself - really makes me feel guilty as fuck.

I've tried everything I can to make her feel attractive - I constantly tell her how pretty she is, etc. But all she does in response to this is reference the past and continue degrading herself.

tl;dr - Shitty things happened in the first 6 months of relationship to make my SO feel like she was unattractive - one year later and I still can't make her understand that she is the cutest girl ever. wat do

We have remained in contact since the break up (I moved out of our apartment) and we talk about once a week about different things. I plead for her to come out and see my new apartment or grab a drink and she'll say ""not yet"" or things like that. She's basically waiting for me to get over her

I found out yesterday she has been seeing someone new for about 4 weeks- as you might imagine this is fucking heartbreaking. Finding this out feels worse than the initial breakup. Someone ELSE having feelings for her

I believe in this girl. I believe I could marry her and spend the rest of my life with her. She has told me that the door isn't closed and that she does really want to remain friends

So my question is this: how can I remain in her life and show her that I'm really the man she wants- without it seeming like I'm trying to tear them apart?  I really want to keep a relationship with her

My first approach was to ""give it some time"" and give her some distance

",2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/13fpzn/xpostrelationships_my_m25_so_f25_of_7_years_feels/,"
I’m [M25] and my SO [F25]. We’ve been in a relationship for 7 years.

A bit of background: [I provide more details about our sexual dynamic as I think our problem is rooted in sexual matters]

We have both grown up in the same middle eastern country. We’re both educated and very secular and despite having to carry on a relationship in a religious society we tried to make it work. The major issue in our relationship was sex. Sex before marriage isn’t socially acceptable where we are from, despite continuous efforts from both sides. 

I was her first and I feel like she was my first because my previous encounters were not significant. Even after we started doing it

We both moved to Canada to both obtain Master’s degrees. The university that accepted me was in Toronto, I moved to Montreal to live with her. The whole reason that I am studying in Canada is for her. I actually had multiple better opportunities in the states, but I chose our relationship over these opportunities. She on the other hand did not sacrifice anything, because her program in Montreal was the best opportunity for her; she just chose what was best for her. If I were to quantify the opportunities that I missed: I would have graduated already, in a program that I preferred to the one I am currently in, and worked, making over $10, but I was forced to only contribute $300 a month for rent

In regards to my studies. I was able to structure my studies in a way that I could do most of them without actually travelling to Toronto. 

Later on I found out that she didn’t really want to move in yet but she did it anyway because it was financially the only way we could make it work at the time. I

We lived together, but overall, average. I have always put more effort in during sex to pleasure her (than she does to pleasure me) as she doesn’t reach orgasm easily and I feel as if it is because of her oppressed past, she should be able to enjoy it as much as physically possible now that we live in a healthier society. I feel that she didn’t reciprocate my efforts. You can imagine that at this point we gradually started to feel less excited sexually. Sex became a chore on my part, I felt as if I always had to bring more sexual excitement to her, while knowing that it was not not going to work, because she’s not mentally excited

This was the biggest problem in the relationship for her. I did lots of research, the sex was average, 4-5 times a week, and I didn’t feel that anything was off; there was no indication of any dissatisfaction. Minor indications were her not orgasming every single time, and having a bad mood after sex. 1 year into living together, she started to demand more and better sex, constantly being dissatisfied and asking me to put more effort into it. Later she asked me to lose weight, and research about general sexual pleasures, and after talking to her. After I researched

A year and four months into living together (last April

She’s a sexual girl and wants it all the time. But at the same time she needs me to work on it and properly arouse her, often leading to 30-45 minutes of foreplay, entailing kissing her on the neck, dirty talk, spanking, massaging her breasts, playing with her clit, change foreplay positions, it only got harder to satisfy her. We discussed alternatives, so it’s come up frequently

This was our situation 5 months ago.Then I left Canada to pay my parents a visit for a month. She was busy with her master’s thesis. I returned and she seemed stressed, I didn’t react as intensely as someone who’s just been kick out would react. I didn’t want to break up but if she could cope with it, I would probably have shown my unhappiness to this recent setback in our relationship by not returning her phone calls for a few days or other usual stuff, or even more. But I didn’t.

I moved to this sort of party house, and the sex was better than it has been in our entire relationship, although I was repressing my unhappiness about the whole thing the whole time. The constant parties and the weed and beer calmed me down a bit, but to this day I carry that emotional baggage of being kicked out, because I never got to express it properly.

I needed to move to Toronto temporarily for my program. I stayed at her place for a week during my transition, saying that she was wrong and she loves living with me. I was still unhappy, partly because I didn’t think she was sincere, maybe because I was leaving soon anyway.

I moved to Toronto mid-September, for a couple of days each, one to celebrate her birthday. I was still trying hard, just like I always was, I talked to her over skype for at least 2 hours every day, I even made her a birthday card myself, putting a lot of time and effort into it; I did things like this often. The sex is better than ever. Everything seemed good

Now we get to last night. We had a talk. She told me that being close to her mom drives her crazy because it reminds her constantly how much she doesn’t want to be like her. Of course

(Quick side note here, this is how she characterizes her mom)

She started the conversation by telling me about how her mom makes her feel and how much she doesn’t want to be like her. And then she tells me that she knows she’s wrong but she can’t help but feel deep down that I’m making her old like her mom, being with me.

I was shocked. I came there to talk about regular daily stuff with her. My first reaction was silence as I was digesting what it meant. The second thing that popped into my head was that I should shave this goddamn November truckstache I’m growing, it doesn’t make sense. Of course she was acting distraught and taking back her words on account of being on her period and having her mom visit and me being far away from her geographically. But the fact is, this is not the first time, similar conversations have come up, and I feel and know that on some level she thinks like that, although she might be reluctant to admit it all the time, because we are otherwise a perfect couple. I tried to prove to her that she goes back on what she says when she feels like what she said is hurting me. She would tell me that she feels old being with me
and then she would apologize and tell me that she said that because she was on her period. I ended up saying that I won’t call her

It’s been a day, or didn’t answer my phone, she would break up with me. 

Should I let her go? Or push her enough to break up with me?  Should I stay with her

What do you think?

We were technically ""still dating other people"" before then but neither of us got much action to be honest (well I didn't, I think Mr. Stud over there might have).

1347470760.0,zrwqz,Taking care of a cheater.,roosterbro,9,4,6,"There is a general consensus that when someone lies to you, then the relationship is dead so you bury it and move on.

But what if this isn't a symptom of relationship problems, they perceived problems that weren't there, but still felt real, and became false memories they used to justify their actions. What if they are easily lead by others, bending to social pressures, and someone else acted upon them to pull them into their spell.

What if they're just sick? A personality disorder only you can see because you've been with them for years. Although it tears you up inside, how is cutting them out of your protective wing the right thing to do?

The relationship may be disordered, and they need help. It's preferable if everyone can partner up with perfect people, but that's not reality. Various mental deficits are all around, and if we all just cast the people with problems out they're left to bounce around harming themselves, and others they get involved with.

If you are stable in a way they are not, and channel your physical acts safely, then aren't you the best candidate to be cheated on? Isn't this a good opportunity for you to love someone who needs your love most? If they end up with someone like them, they'll be even more lost because neither will have any clue how to avoid disasters.

Although there may be a certain level of force involved, isn't it a valid option to embrace someone who broke your trust? To instead of doing what your instinct suggests in pushing them out with vengeance, you pull them in tight and secure them from their own insecurities?

It's not a pleasant idea to be likened to an infantile role, and don't understand how that works, how its toxicity will poison the foundation of human relations. They're lost following a disfigured pathway of feelings, that inevitably leads to pain and chaos.

They're lost, and think they're deciding for them, it's not just selfishness, it's a mistake, it's a misunderstanding, it's evidence of psychological disorder.

Isn't turning on them similarly immature and dysfunctional as what they did? To be the best person, isn't their cheating itself driven by such shortsighted and lazy emotional drives?

I don't want to give the impression that I don't want her to transfer because of me, but its almost like I KNOW that this relationship will fail, so why put anything into it.

I have a friend who I went to college with (we'll call her H), though I do consider the fact it might be weird for her.

We've always been good friends, but never really pursued it as an interest due to the aforementioned reasons. Anyways, we don't live/work in the same towns, but we keep in touch and visit when possible now that college is over and we are both working.

She came up and visited me for my birthday earlier this spring. Of course as the birthday boy, really, just that I hated the fact that I was ""that guy"" sucking face in the middle of a bar around closing time.

I started thinking after that moment that what if it wasn't rooted purely in drunken lack of inhibitions? I've never been a fan of long distance relationships (one of the reasons that forced my last relationship spiraled into disaster). I wouldn't really consider just under 2 hours ""long distance"" as it's an easy after-work drive. Granted

Fast forward to this past weekend. I am going down to visit a mutual friend for their birthday. I know my friend is going to be there, I'm drunk but coherent, and I'm being led by the hand outside by ""H"".

It continues for a moment, before we take a step back and think about it. Neither of us says anything for a good ten seconds before it resumes, but much more intensely than before. 

Obviously the thoughts running through my head at the moment are ""Is she just super drunk?"" or ""What is this all about?"". I am extremely attracted her to physically

We eventually grab a cab, she's drunk, I'm still not sure what the thought process was, but she was clearly in command here (not that I mind of course). Needless to say I started to sober up and decided it was best I didnt stay the night, for fear I'd wake up to the worst case scenario (her ""WTFing!"")

I woke up at my other friend's house to a text basically asking what happened last night. I wanted to meet her in person, especially that she took advantage of me (which I tried to remind her that she did not, and that it takes two to tango). She kept asking me if I was okay and are we still friends. I told her there was nothing that could have happened that erase our friendship. I told her I was fine.

We have the chronic, there are different situations with each relationship that come into play

A couple has been dating for two years. One party creates an online dating profile and cheats on his/her significant other at least once per month. Though he/she feels a little bad

IMO

However, confess or don't. Either way the relationship is not compromised and the two stay together in the end.

Option A, the relationship is like fine china and can be glued back together but cannot hold as much pressure as before. Every time the cheater goes out on his/her own, the partner wonders and arguments are frequent. Every time pressure is added, the relationship grows weaker and cannot be the same.

Option B, solidifying what limits they may have and avoiding them in the future. This allows them to become a better person and (eventually) ultimately make the relationship stronger through self-growth.

[The above

I think this is the idea that those who stand by the idea of not confessing to a one-time screw up stand behind. What do you think?

Our family is a bit more spread out so it's more difficult to introduce her to them.  

As for my friend.. she's been in a 4 year relationship with this guy.. and still hasn't been introduced to any of his friends except for one by accident.  I'm not so concerned for my brother as I am concerned for my friend.

She has asked me if its weird that she doesn't know any of her bf's friends and I did tell her something was off but was not sure if my initial feelings were justified.

The reason why I want to know is to advise my friend on this matter as she perceives her current bf as a potential marriage partner.

There's no debating that personalities, there are basic interests and behaviors that men exhibit that are universal. I am going to explain a couple of things that I have experienced and researched about men and serious relationships. This is mostly to help women in long term serious relationships put some things into perspective. 

 Men love looking at women. ALL women they find attractive (and even some that they don't). 
-You may (or may not) come into problems in your relationship where you realize that your boyfriend/fiance/husband may occasionally comment on other girls, etc. Now, I have realized that allot of women are in denial about this subject.  

YES. Your man, he liked to look at them ALLOT. Now I know there are men out there (due to their upbringing, religion, etc) where this is not too common for them. However, men are BIOLOGICALLY programmed to seek out females, even if they are in a serious relationship. (Note that ""serious monogamous relationships"" were not always the main deal with humanity). It doesn't make him love you less, it doesn't make him ""love"" other women.  

Your man will masturbate to porn (with, it really isn't their fault. That pretty little hormone (testosterone) is almost completely to blame.  
Basically what I'm trying to say is, fantasized about, thinks about and has urges for other women (pretty much on a regular basis), you're going to be really miserable. You're going to find porn on his computer, you're going to notice him ""checking out"" other women. You will never get an honest answer to ""Is she pretty?"" or ""Do you find that hot?"" because honestly, yes.. she is pretty. Yes, that is hot. Yes, and mom

They do not have much control over these urges, worry free, and able to stay in a long term relationship.  
You may experience this in your relationship and feel terrible. You may wonder ""why?"" allot, confused, shameful and embarrassed about it won't make it stop (forever, at least). It is something that must be accepted in order for relationships to happily work out.  

There are many arguments for why this is. Such as hormones, etc. No matter the explanation, the main thing is that you realize that its not YOU. If your man is in love and wants to stay with you, and you love him just as much, by god please try to look past his porn fetishes and urges to masturbate when not around you. He has the right (as well as you) to masturbate, fantasize, and have private time to explore and fulfill sexual urges. (I'm not condoning cheating, for that is a whole other subject.) 
 
So, it is up to you to change your perspective. Choose to be more open and accepting, or choose to be insecure and miserable...

**History**

I met her five years ago and after half a year our relationship started 'officially'. After six months we had sex for the first time (we were both virgins). The sex was amazing and it happened at least 200 times a year (my GF counted it). After something like a year

I don't know when it started exactly but the amount of sex we had decreased. She complained about being tired and having headaches. She also spoke about pain after having sex. I wasn't that worried: she didn't look that upset and my penis is sensitive too after an orgasm. 

**This winter** 

My room is quite cold and she blamed that for the lack of sex. I noticed she was less wet. When temperatures starting rising

**Other solutions**

I suggested that trying a different birth-control pill might help her

Then I asked her to start masturbating. She doesn't masturbate and has never had an orgasm. I think masturbating will help her understand her genitals and what she likes and that she might even learn how to have an orgasm. It seems less embarrassing than visiting a doctor. But she doesn't want to masturbate (she isn't religious

**More information**

* She doesn't want to talk about sex. She doesn't use the words 'penis
* AFAIK
* A lack of foreplay is not the problem. Pain after sex has always been a problem in recent years - regardless of how wet she was
* Sex is gradually becoming more 'standard'. In the past she often was on top and we did 'it' while standing, in showers, etcetera. Now it only happens in bed, while she lays on her back on stomach, letting me do 'the work'. 
* I will update this list if I think of more relevant information

**TL;DR:** Girlfriend can't orgasm and experiences pain after sex (she says its on the 'outside', use lube or masturbate. The amount of sex we have decreased from over 200 times per year to twice a month.

This has been a source of conflict between us in the past, and I know that might be wrong, but it's true. Partially it is because I am scared and paranoid that she might be going out with someone else behind my back or avoiding me or doing other things to hurt me and I have no idea if she is or isn't doing those things, and if our relationship was out in the open, it would be much more difficult for her to do those things. **Am I being paranoid?**

However, she also confides hardly anything to me. I trust her unconditionally with pretty much every aspect of my life that she wants to know, but she says that trust is not given, but earned: I hardly know anything about her. For example, I know she loves poetry and art, but she has yet to read me any of her poetry while she attends poetry club every Friday and shows a whole group of people her work each week. I know everybody moves at their own pace, but I desperately want to learn more about her. **Is this being pushy? Should I force myself to try and calm down about her to keep the relationship alive?**

This leads to my third point. Because our relationship is secret, but I don't know if she is as caring about me. She has told me that she usually just doesn't do relationships, so I think that my          over-zealousness might be pushing her away. She has stated before that she is worried that the relationship might be unbalanced as she thinks I am putting more into it than she is(I told her not to worry about it, because I didn't want her to worry about it), and I am beginning to think she might be right. **Am I just being clingy?

He had a car and I didn't. He didn't enjoy driving, and he would drive. He'd also drive to the grocery store). My issue was that sometimes I would want him to drive me places and he would never (literally never) drive me anywhere he didn't also need to go, citing that it was his car so he shouldn't have to use it for other people. For example, he's a pickier eater than I am, and I usually was okay with the restaurants that he likes, but my favorite cuisine type (Asian) was off limits because the only Asian food he likes is fried rice. Needless to say, we always went to his favorite restaurants. 

Occasionally this would come up in an argument because I would really be craving Asian food (I hardly ever had it, it is his car, and he should be the one to decide what to do with it), but at the same time, I feel like in a relationship, sometimes you should do things for your SO solely to make them happy and not out of any benefit to yourself. This argument also came up if I had to go to the drugstore or buy school supplies, or wanted to go to the grocery store when he didn't need to, but I don't feel like a quick trip to officemax is a big deal.

During this time, he did manage to shoot me a text stating “I just don’t want us to stop seeing eachother.”

When I was a foolish, I had experienced two things; my first Relay for Life fundraiser, and being literally sucker punched by cupid's arrow. I was making my way across the football field, when I heard some other teens laughing while kicking a soccer back and forth. But then it happened. That cliche moment when time slows to nothingness, and that cheesy saxophone plays as your eyes morph into two hearts of desire. She stood there, athletic wear on, long, and with a confidence around her that just magnified the longing for her. I wanted her

I didn't get her. Weeks went by and my friend came over one night. Being her friend, early to rise kinda guy, he dozed off and I took full advantage of the security-less phone. I looked through the texts, envious of her flirtatious attitude she delivered through the texts. Although I cannot recall how I received her number, I believe I might taken it that night.

Days go by, but I thought she was the most beautiful creature I have ever had the pleasure to lay eyes on. Stop. I held the backspace button as long as my sigh of discontent carried. ""Hey"", I SO cleverly wrote. The conversation went no where. As it would. For months. Months of my incapability to shut up and grow a pair. 

Junior year. I had to. I just had to confess. Seeing her beauty made me more and more resentful I had not yet confided in her my desires. We had built up little more than a casual, but nothing more than that. I mentioned other things to her too that she thought were cute and would occasionally harass me for originally saying. This went on for an excruciating amount of time, us both gaining and losing boyfriends and girlfriends through the sleepless nights of high school. After a while, she never wrote me, and made it seem like I was interfering with other people's talk if I wrote her, so reluctantly, I maintained minimal contact, she would occasionally ask me if I still felt that way. I would get my hopes up. ""This is it, playing it off as if she wanted to catch up on the life of someone who mattered so very little in the large scheme of hers. I told her a different answer. I explained how I've noticed that rudimentary pattern of her inquiries leading to the inevitable; me, taken back. She claimed that those were not her intentions

One week after that? She invited me over after my Senior prom. We didn't have sex. We didn't party like teenagers around us. This girl, in her yoga pants and an old tee shirt. I had never seen her look any more beautiful. She brought me upstairs to watch Tv and eat Ben and Jerry's (Thus introducing me to Phish food) and after looking at me with those eyes of absolute captivation. Simply kissed me once. We both smiled and knew what that meant to me. She is such a wonderful girl. Although it has been such a very short time together, we have hit it off in so many ways that neither of us have previously felt in other relationships. We satisfied in the fact that we can be what we are with each other. Goofy. I'll crack jokes that aren't funny and she'll laugh to make me feel good, and she'll sing the soundtrack of CATS! horribly! (on purpose), I love every word of it. She, and her absolute absurdities, completely complete me.

My only regret? Not standing up earlier. Not telling her what she meant to me. Although I do not resent the time lost, you're abandoning your principles and free falling. But push through. Fight for what you love. Who you love. Don't. Ever. Give up.

Now, cheat, get jealous or angry, and am very understanding. 

Al was the first girl to ever give me that chance and I was the first to show her my truer side. We instantly fell in love and had a great summer and sophomore year together. But

She was the catalyst for my weight loss and I ended up shedding 35lbs and grew to about 5""8' and became the happiest guy in the world until I started noticing I wasn't feeling the same way I used to feel about Al. I didn't really enjoy hanging out with her or doing the habitual routines or even engaging in our favorite activity

A year went by like this where I would constantly sacrifice my happiness just to suffice hers. A year where we broke up and got back together 3 times, I realized I had just been a parasite slowly sucking the life out of her. I still feel terrible because she loved me even though I had changed completely in the relationship. I was no longer the person she used to know and she STILL loved me. 

I decided enough was enough and she deserved someone WAY better than me and we moved on. Now that I see her happy again I feel complete. I have given my apologies and made clear to her the reason for the break up and everything and she of course understood. This was January of this year and upon moving on I finally had the option to be myself again and rediscover who I truly wish to be. 

Well, beautiful, blue green eyes. Her hair was blond and in a ponytail and she was wearing her work uniform, but to me she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. I had to talk to her. I had to get her number. No, I needed to. But my words failed me. For the first time, they utterly ran like a scared puppy and refused to show themselves. 

It went like this for about a week, we hit it off like no other. I ended up getting her number and started talking to her and getting to know her better. 

She is an 18 year old senior at a high school around 30 minutes away from me and just got out of a bad relationship. We decided to meet up, she's a picky girl) and immediately set up another time together. 

That time together was today, me holding her in my arms and stroking her hair. I have never felt this way about anyone, including Al, and something about Whitney makes me believe she could be the one. I know I'm young and naive and we all think this at sometime when we are 17 years old, but I honestly believe this.

* She's 3 years younger than me.
* *First time we got together*: it was just under a year when I got cold feet, and I also needed space from her - I broke up with her, she was very upset.
* *Second time we got together*: After a year of not really talking, we decided to relationship up a second time. Our bond was as strong as ever. My affection for her only deepened around this time and I took to telling her I loved her often. I was happy with it all, content. After about six months she broke up with me abruptly. I was pretty calm about it as it happened. The way I saw it, I agreed to her decision out of respect. The way she saw it, I didn't ""fight"" for Us enough. I was probably so accepting of it because I had hurt her feelings* and felt huge guilt, in addition to being the initiator of the first breakup. So, in her words
* *More current stuff*: We began talking again sometime later and we were comforted by eachother. We went our separate ways again after we both said we were happy being single and weren't ""waiting for the time to be right for us to work"". I told her what we had was extremely special and worked

Recently, how she is the most special person I know (totally true), how I am very open about saying I still love her to this day. He advised I talk to her. So I did. 

We went on a date last night and after the initial catch-up talk we were just as intimate as ever. She is more beautiful than ever, the person I respect more than any other in my life...

Or was it? As jubilant as I felt, OR am I just lonely as fuck and latching onto what was my most successful, compatible relationship?* I should also say that I have a fear of commitment that manifests itself in fantasies of exotic travel, womanizing and sexual conquest and such, but I simultaneously know deep inside that all of that is actually rubbish and will leave me alone and fucked up... If you made it this far, thanks, and I'd be happy to divulge more info if asked. :)))

 * When I say ""hurt her feelings"" I want to specify. We never cheated on each other, and was aloof and then wondered why she didn't come to comfort me in my vulnerable state. I was fucked up in the head and I in turn fucked her up a little. It was emotional bullying, no doubt about it. Me feeling *intense* guilt about these instances was common when they would be brought up. Even *now* when I recall the shitty things I said and did, I cringe inwardly. I worked through these issues I had since then now. I can say I don't think these issues would plague a good relationship if I were to find myself in one now.

She has struggled with depression and anxiety since she was 16 years old and it has never been fully addressed or treated.  She was unable to go to high school because her best friend turned on her and created a lot of drama

She is currently unemployed, visiting friends or family, etc). I am the sole provider and I certainly do not rely on her or anyone else financially, but as someone who has suffered from depression and anxiety in the past, I know that having a job offers structure to a person's day, and it gives you a sense of purpose.  I feel that she really needs this but her anxiety and depression are keeping her from pursuing anything of this sort.  

When she moved here originally, and at this point she has been unemployed for about a year now.

I am constantly pressured by my family with questions as to why she is not working.  I use my own funds to care for her, and she has been staying with me in my apartment with her tiny dog and my landlord's do not know about this.  The original plan was for us to work together and save our money so that we could eventually move out and into a place where we don't have to hide the dog or her.  I have told her that this can't be accomplished on my income alone.

I am scared of what is happening to us.  I love her so much but I do not know how to help her and my patience is and has been running thin.  I was always told to ""get over"" my anxiety and I always overcame it on my own, but I do believe this downward spiral has slowly turned me bitter or resentful and I really wish that it hasn't.  Tomorrow I plan to call my old counselor who offers couple's counseling to see if I can get in and how much the sessions would cost under my new insurance.  

My girlfriend has asked that instead of letting everything build up and taking my frustration and anger out on her, and when I look ahead 5 years I don't see what I want.  I want to have a happy future with her but she can't put forth the same effort as me as long as she is wallowing in her depression and anxiety.

As a woman trying to date this man, but the closeness, like I said, was extremely discouraging. I mean, I thought I'd eventually have thoughts like: Why isn't it my family he's that close with? Why is he going on family vacations with her family when it should be mine? etc. 

so I said I couldn't handle it and he agreed we probably shouldn't spend time together anymore.

Both 27, and both doing the medical school thing. We know we're going to get married some day, but timing is tricky due to the educational gauntlet.

We had started wearing these cheesy friendship bracelets during a camping trip. I bought them in a gas station as a dorky prank--make the boyfriend walk around with a matching

Well, both of us were reluctant to take them off. Yes, embarrassingly, at some point we assigned meaning to these $2.00 purchases, originally intended for funsies.

As the professional world goes, nonetheless.

Recently (in an attempt to remain humble but provide enough information to the reader: we're a smokin' couple) he and I have received a surge of strangers hitting on us individually. I began to wear a silver toe-ring around my left finger as a deterrent. My other half said he would consider doing the same.

(Hang in there

A while back, I got to thinking... we needed to scrap the friendship bracelets....why not upgrade to friendship RINGS?

Obviously, I think we'd both like to have another, more legitimate, symbol of our connection. The obvious answer is: just fucking get married. But, we do NOT have the time or money for that. And we'd like to involve family and friends. So, it has to wait. Additionally, we have such a solid relationship

He LOVES the rings. Thinks they're awesome (and he's not even a jewelry person). He mentioned it not being a bad idea to wear a left-handed ring as a deterrent. And when I brought up the subject of possible ""friendship rings"" tonight

When this thing between us started I didn't have much interest in him at all but the more I've gotten to know him the more I've grown to like him, he didn't protest or warn that I shouldn't.

So now its this month and he went and hung out with one of his new friends that happens to be a girl and that didn't bother me at all when he came back I asked him if he had fun and he said yes and so I asked him if they had sex cause what we have/had wasn't set in stone

So I ask him for a label.....and he says no. Which is fine I can take the no

So then we end up talking about what goes on between us for a few days cause we talk about it in between our usual conversations, idc i was just sleeping with you. To the final, I'm scared of losing you but I'm more scared of getting into something with you then having it fizzle out and not have it in me to end it with you. 

I keep flipflopping between just staying the course with him and if things just continue and get better then to bring it up again or if I should just completely forget about him, he tries but ends up talking in circles. Even the sex is awesome and its cause its the same thing we can talk about it and communicate what each person wants and each person is willing to do or at least try.

1340598788.0,vk2fz,Male (26) Needs some advice about a commitment-phobic GF (25). ,throwawaynumero3,7,2,16,"Hello Reddit

I have been dating this girl for about 7 months now. To say that the relationship has had its share of issues so far would be kind of an understatement. The girl I'm dating has some intimacy/relationship issues stemming from past relationships and childhood issues that have manifested themselves in a few different ways

Pretty shortly after we started dating, tied to some performance anxiety on my part, has lead us to having a basically sexless relationship. We have talked about it and were working on trying to address it by going back to a ""dating stage"" where we were going to try to work our way back up to sex by holding hands, kissing, making out, etc.  

I thought this was going well, which I thought was a good sign, but then I kind of got hit out of left field earlier this week. 

She was preparing to go on a vacation trip with her family during which she had already established she was leaving her phone off so she could have no distractions. After hanging out one evening

She reiterated several times that she ""really likes"" me and that she is doesn't want to lose me (as a friend or otherwise). She has had a string of bad relationships and a rough childhood

We had a pretty lengthy conversation that ended amicably enough

The question is coming soon

The 7 month relationship has not gone as smoothly as I would hope so far. She has difficulty letting her guard down and distances herself in an effort to prevent herself from getting hurt. When we started dating, but the barriers and defense mechanisms she puts up basically guarantee this. To top it off, my friends and family see her issues and all basically tell me I should break up with her. (saying that I could find someone without the issues and it would be easier for me). 

I am a very patient person and I'm told that I'm way too nice. I am willing to try to stick it out with her to help her see that she is actually worth something. I care about her very much, but I do care about her and want to help her get over some of these issues.  Sorry for the novel, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Ok so in my last note it was about the advice that my Momma gave me. There were a few things that I wanted to go into much further detail and share some of my experience on how I achieved it.

1. **FIRST LEARN TO LOVE YOURSELF AND BE HAPPY BY YOURSELF:** Yes sure this is easier said than done for some people. I'm not saying that anyone is perfect, that at night I was exhausted and didn't want to deal with anything, not even my kids sometimes. I know that sounds bad, but it's the truth. So in order for me to be happy I had to stop being friends or associate with them. Yeah sure it hurt at first to have to throw a friendship away. But in the long run I became happy because I no longer felt like I was being used. I now surround myself with positive people and understand that people can have a bad day (or two). But if they have nothing but negativity coming from their mouth and/or actions, I dump them in a heart beat. As my momma always says: Life is too short to be unhappy!

3. **WHEN YOU MEET THE RIGHT PERSON, she made it a point to not date a guy that wanted more kids or had more than 2 kids of his own. Yeah well neither of them wanted kids, but my dad had 6 kids already from previous marriages. That completely didn't matter to her. She has also told me that she could be her complete self around him and didn't have to ""try"" to impress him. Everything just came naturally and just went with a flow. Since I have met my BF, I know what she means. Within two weeks of meeting him I knew that I wanted to be with him for the rest of my life. I can picture myself with him for the rest of my life, going on trips with him and my kids, getting married to him and becoming a family one day. Before I met him I said that I would never get married, even if I met the right man. Yeah well that's thrown out the window, but if he wants to have one

4. **NEVER SETTLE:** There's a song by Surgarland called, but it was cause I knew he wasn't everything that I wanted. Settling for someone just to fill those voids just leads to more loneliness and unhappiness. So I kept moving on and made a mental list of what I wanted in/of a man every time I did. I just added on to my list with every relationship, because something was always lacking. My list consisted of 10 things that I wanted in/of a man: 1. I want to be able to be myself around him, completely. I don't want to hold nothing back, because then it wouldn't be the true me he falls in love with. 2. I want him to accept and treat my children as if they were his own (and vice versa if he had kids). 3. Be able to talk to each other about anything, even the most stupidest and silliest things. Communication is very important to me. 4. My family and friends all have to like him and get along with him. 5. Not controlling in any way. I have dated plenty of men who think that they have to control me to keep me close. Yes I am a flirt, but that doesn't mean I'm going to cheat or anything of the sort. I have been cheated on and know the feeling and wouldn't want anyone else to feel that pain. 6. Honesty. Even when it's criticism. The truth hurts sometimes, but I know that when I do need help I do ask. 10. I want a man who gives as much as he takes from the relationship. I'm a giver like I said before and sometimes I don't take as much from the other person in the relationship. So I want someone who does give and not just takes. I end up feeling used and abused in the end and I don't want to feel like that when I'm dating someone.

I hope that this advice helps you or someone you know. It's taken me along time to follow this advice myself. But once I did,False,,t5_2sa5c,False,,,t3_ucd2y

I can't tell if I am happy or unhappy in the relationship:


1) I live in a foreign country (Peru, but a culture-for-the-city-I-live-in thing. I am experienced living in other countries but I am not happy here (which disappoints my formerly naive self who loved Anthropology).


2) Given the above


3) I actually AM happy with my job and out of work activities


4) I am clashing with his family.  The don't talk about things that bother them and I don't obey the mom as much as she would like.  I am VERY direct (though I keep pretty much everything to myself around them which takes a lot of will-power).  I tried to explain my interpretation of some events to the mom once after she flipped out (I paid her back for something and thanked her


5) My SO is very committed and we adopted a dog together which he believes is like having a child together.  I do believe he thinks I am the one for the rest of his life. He does try very hard to improve and does learn things very well


6) As his family does not communicate very well he is learning. He has gotten much better and saying when he is upset and wants something from me.  He does not communicate on a much deeper level though.  This could be a man thing but almost all of my male friends and I can talk about religions, growth etc for hours and the two of us do not really get into those subjects.  Maybe this goes away though when you spend so much time with someone?


7) He is a very serious person.  At work I am always the happy smiley one.  In fact


8) We would make excellent parents together but neither of us is really interested in having children. I always avoiding being the ""Mom"" or ""Baby"" in the house game as a kid.  I was usually the dog (also almost always had only male friends). 


With the above (there is so much more but that is enough for now) I would like to know


If this person loves you and is a great great catch in his culture


I feel like we have already improved a lot but at some point maybe you just need to say its never enough.  Where is this point?


Basically, but maybe just being a good team is not enough, or maybe its temporary and later we can be better.

We've had a really rough year. We were engaged and living together until last fall when he got publicly blackout drunk and was hugely offensive and verbally abusive. It was the icing on the cake of a few months of a failing relationship. I moved out but we kept dating. Tried counseling but the therapist wanted to only see him due to his substance abuse problems before seeing the two of us together. This was about nine months ago. After the incident in question, boyfriend stops seeing therapist

We decided to go our separate ways in March after we decided we didn't feel like we were going anywhere. We got back together a few weeks later (of course). Since then, my best friend and my love. 

He recently returned from an overseas trip with family. I picked him up at the airport and felt like something was off. I smelled a rat. I wanted him to tell me himself what was going on. He did not. Eventually, ""I decided to have a few drinks while I was over there. Just one or two at a time. It was no big deal. I just have to control myself."" Then he gets up and leaves the room to cook food for us. I am fucking floored. After the public drunken episode (which was really really bad, by the way), he blamed his behavior on his alcoholism. Said he was going to control it. Now, I feel like by his drinking again, and being so nonchalant about it, he is essentially taking back all his excuses and reasons for his bad behavior. Then, he reveals that he started drinking again back in March when we broke up for a stint. He's sorry

Now, thoughtful, polite and cheerful.

We've been in the same classes for about four semesters now. When I met her, he breaks up with her because of some stupid reason. It takes her a month to get over him. After that, she reverts to her previous extreme partying self. Now, almost every other ""guy"" friend of hers is REALLY trying to go after her, but she wants to stay single for a while and is too nice to say no, so she lets them take her out for dates, etc. Also does random hookup sessions and sleepovers with them

Now here's the real dilemma: I think I like her (it's impossible for anyone not to), caring, nice and is a joy to be around. But she also has very high expectations from a relationship. She is also extremely needy, very sensitive, very narcissistic and self-absorbed (she knows how hot she is and flaunts it like there's no tomorrow), CANNOT STOP TALKING and can have ridiculous mood swings from one minute to the next. Then there's me, a semi-introvert who has never been in a relationship and is looking for something that would actually last with someone that I cared a lot about.

The problem? I see it ending very quickly with her if we were to date. We're polar opposites in personality, she'll be happily dating some other dude."" This upsets me quite a bit.

Hi Reddit

I need to apologise (I'm not even sure if it will work because I f*ed up big time but I'll ask what ye think?

My bf needs his space for now so I'm going to give it to him but I want to make a really meaningful apology. I've sourced a cool gift box (in his favorite color) for starters. I'm going to write a long apology letter (and say all the things that need to be said).
I was going to buy him a voucher for a shop he hasn't been to yet (because he hasn't visited the city yet) but one that he's really looking forward to going to (to give him something to look forward to instead of having to feel hurt) and (if i can afford it - i'll find the money from somwhere hopefully - I'm going to buy 2 tickets for that city). I was also going to donate money to a charity close to his heart in his name because a gift like that is more meaningful than most i think and put all these things in the box. I don't want to do this if it's cheezy and meaningless. The letter will be sincere but I want to make this apology special. What do you think Reddit? If it's a bad idea please say so and if you've any alternatives please say so too.

    O.K. So I met a girl at a music festival because she was friends with my friends. We kissed and fell asleep together that Sunday night, and we start from there. 

  I see her that tues for a no big deal, without really saying anything. Leaves me upstairs for 20 mins while I am kind of just day dreaming, and it is pretty late
 (3 am). 

 I come downstairs and she is passed out on top of her guy friends who is my mutual friend. She had said she'd known him for 10 yrs and she is a bit out of his league. This was a total drunk type of passed out too bc they both look uncomfortable.

Dude starts to try to get into her pants, how can she have WANTED the night to end up like that...*  So I'll give her the benefit of the doubt.


I decided that it would kind of piss me off to hang out with her again and have the same sort of thing happen. This is where I went wrong

 She of course didn't know that because she is terrible at communication via phone, planning on having a ""So what do you want/ what are you looking for in a relationship"" type of convo.

She was weird about answering, so I would be in the area, I ask her if I can take her out sat. night. I knew I was going to be hungry, so I booked a table at one of my fav. restaurants and she was pretty responsive to me asking her out.

I just wanted a sat. night date


She flakes

Now also you must understand that I am in the last summer of my Sr. yr as a chemical engineer. I am raging it every day and night. She has a full time job and is busy.

So she blew me off that sat, ill have to get back to you"" ???

I ask her if she is going to a bluegrass show we both see on tuesdays at a local pub near her. She is nice and responsive. 

  She gets a new job. Now I am already annoyed by how she cant txt me back in a reasonable manner, would lead to the dissipation of this romance. I made a move, I sent text along the lines of ""I want to see you again, I want to kiss you again, you are talented and it turns me on. I know you are going to be super busy but, if you don't make some time for me, we will never get to know each other.""  
 

I got a little freaked out that I freaked HER out so I followed up like 30 mins later, freaking out the girl I like""  
for 2 reasons, shit happens fast, and I want a summer squeeze. 

It wasnt working out for either of us I guess

flakes on the Tuesday

She peters off into unresponsiveness. I am totally chill for about a week in my txts, saying that if I was in the hood, I would stop by. Which I would be, for other reasons than her anyway, truthfully. 

Probably freaked her out more

 "" You sure you dont want to txt me something to keep this alive? If not I just want you to know I wont be awkward if you see me and I am thankful for the time we did share together. If you want to pick this up again at some time

She finally answers and says I am comming on too strong and she has been THAT busy that she couldnt txt. Of course she had time to update her status on fb about how her headphones get all tangled up though. 

My last relationship started out with strong feelings and she returned them

We both were destroying those tiny stomach butterflys for each other simultaneously and both unaware. I might be able to salvage some broken wings and abdomens

In my head I go through the obvious scenarios that he is telling the truth

So I am absolutely devastated. He contacts me maybe 2 or 3 times while he is overseas to see how I am. He tells me he is thinking about me and missing me. We had planned to maybe see each other once when he got back and I decided that was a terrible idea and told him no because if I was looking forward to seeing him I wouldn't get over him for 3 months.
He returned a few weeks ago. Turns out 4 months wasn't long enough for me anyway

2 days ago he texts me. He needs to talk to me. I knew it was a bad idea but I gave in anyway and he came over last night. He goes on about how he was an idiot and he can't believe that any of the stuff he thought mattered even mattered. Apparently he was lying the other day and it really hurt him to lie and he wants to get back together. We discussed this for a bit and then he kissed me.

I haven't gone back home yet, but only 45 minutes to meet up in the city. So I do plan to take her out when I have the money and hopefully meet her parents. I have to go to Colorado after about a month and stay there for the rest of the summer unfortunately, so I'll missing her for two months.
My plan basically is to go about it head on. Take her out for a movie/dinner/something

Also, but I'm not sure whether or not its too much.

I'd really appreciate any input. Just typing this out has made me feel better

TLDR: Really like this girl I met two months ago at college, but willing to see her whenever I can. She still goes to my college. Should I ask her that I want it to become more serious when I get back home? Is it too much to visit her a lot at her college next semester even though I graduated?",,False,,t5_2sa5c,False,,

I would like to ask if anyone experienced or have insight about following situation:

If I read in non-native language (without translating - *directly thinking in foreign language*) I completely understand text/speech/etc. but when it comes to emotions I feel somehow 'emotionally numb'^1. However

I wonder how this affects relationships. There are two scenarios:

* Person and his/hers SO are both using non-native languages for communication (i.e. at least three languages are involved)
* Person uses his/hers native language and SO uses same language (as foreign)

**TL;DR Emotional numbness in non native language

1366837811.0,1d1bg6,24F looking for general advice while in serious relationships.,throwaway-6151,5,0,2,"  Hi r/relationship_tips. I'm a 24F and have been in a few wonderful long term relationships (1-2 year) from early high school onward
I was hoping you could give me some advice on how to handle emotions and internal conflicts so that I can continue learning and growing and be an even better partner in future relationships.
  
  
1 - Although it's a natural phenomenon that as people grow closer, it seems like it gets easier and easier for me to handle things poorly, maybe because I'm so comfortable with my partner that I don't watch my words very carefully.
 
  For example, and if not will just stir up bad air in general. The weird thing is this kind of behavior doesn't really come from me in newer relationships, and I have no problem addressing most things productively.  My irritability sort of emerges as I get more settled in a serious relationship.  

  My question is: of course I expect to be more comfortable as I start dating someone more seriously
  
2 - I know that in my first relationship, although I still am probably one of the more affectionate type of partner. I've realized that sometimes I confuse the transition from the honeymoon phase to the stable relationship phase with a lack of interest or my partner pulling away.
 
 During these times, reading too much into minor signs from my partner, ect.

  It feels like my previous efforts at managing how I handle these transitions have been effective.. but only for how I handle myself in my relationship and in front of others.  I guess what I mean is

  Can you provide some fresh insight
  

tldr; 24f has decent experience in serious relationships with some single downtime in between.

I should start by saying I love my husband more than anything, truly. I would not change anything.

But every now and then I have these dreams about a past love.

Usually the dreams are romantic in nature, dates, cuddling, kissing...every so often they are sexual, and I wake up feeling very guilty. Obviously I know I didn't cheat

My apologies if I'm breaking some kind of rule. Hoping to get some ideas.)

I have a friend that I have had a crush on for a long time. We worked for many years together up until a few years ago. We haven't really hung out too often since leaving work although we never really hung out outside of work when we were employed either. But when we hangout we have a great time. She's going to grad school in about two months. I never asked her out because I was seeing other people, and I cannot get her off my mind.

As I see it

1. Just pour out all of my feelings

2. Straight up ask her out and date for the next two months; a summer fling

3. Tell her how I feel and then ask her out

4. Leave it alone

Option 1 seems kind of like a wussy move in the sense making me look weak and probably lead to nothing. Option 2 seems good
