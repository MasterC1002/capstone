Before you go asking away, errors, and small cents; though I'm well versed in US coins and grading.  

I'll be happy to answer whatever questions I can, I will leave this AMA open for a week or so until everyone's had their chance to ask their questions.  I do ask that you don't flood the thread with ID or value questions, though I'm happy to answer them as well.

Update 8/22 11PM PST  :

WOW!  Some great questions.  I'll continue answering them as I can for the rest of the week.  I hope that you're all getting some insight on what the professional side of the hobby looks like.

The credibility of reddit.com took a pretty big hit in the eyes of the public recently

I don't entirely agree. Crowdsourcing has been shown to work well in many situations, as well as some very well-read and experienced amateurs.

Sometimes we get things wrong

There have also been a few people who have a proven track record of providing accurate information who have lately been giving some fairly glib and almost disdainful replies. I've also recently been witness to an increase in disrespectful comments and extended bickering

Folks

This is a moderated forum

I want people to have fun here and feel a sense of camaraderie and shared passion for our hobby

Most of our members here are wonderful - both knowledgeable and respectful in their comments. I am fortunate to work with a fantastic moderation team

Heres a little more background, etc.. Well my grandpa was a big coin collector already and is the one who got me into it. Fast forward a couple years, My grandpa (who was only my grandpa from marriage not blood) decided to pick up and leave one day to go to the Philippines. He didn't say goodbye to me (12) or anyone in my family, He took everything he owned except for this chest of coins which my grandma decided to give me when I turned 16. But I stopped collecting coins once he left. So fast forward some more, I'm about to turn 21 and I decided to finally go through that chest and maybe get back into coin collecting, I wanted to share going through it with someone so I figured this would be something r/coins would like. I know you can't see much in these pictures, its because I took them last night and haven't gone through anything yet. I was thinking of making a video of me going through them or just taking a lot of pictures

1357520687.0,163a9q,Hello from a new collector!,Whizb4ng,22,0,21,"I have been lurking in this subreddit for the better part of 4+ months or so and have made the decision to start collecting coins. I have been fascinated by coins for many years and am looking forward to starting this new hobby. I am most interested in ancient's (I have a B.A. in Classical History if that helps paint the picture) but generally love all coins. 

While the beginning of my collection is humble at best (I currently have 8 coins) I figured I have to start somewhere and slowly build it up. The final push (or sign as it were) to get me to start a coin collection was New Year's Day when I found a Wheatie in my change (which was strange since I am Canadian and was 7 hours north of the border at the time).

With that I present to you my first three coins http://imgur.com/BYD7I

I really enjoy the Canadian Centennial Penny with the dove it is a pleasant change to the maple leaves. The middle is the aformentioned wheat penny (1948 S). It isn't in the greatest condition but it will do. And finally it is just a standard 1962 Canadian penny I just really enjoy the portrait of the youthful Queen on this penny. My other coins come from counties I have visited

If any of you has advice for a rookie collector and if anyone has a recommendation for a good beginners book for numistics (A Numismatics for Dummies essentially) please let me know!

I look forward to learning from all of you and beg patience if I ask a couple of stupid questions.",self,t5_2qhuq,1357521245.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/163a9q/hello_from_a_new_collector/
