*  My big sister was Diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis not too long ago and it would mean a lot if you guys would take a look around the [National MS society](http://www.nationalmssociety.org/index.aspx) and do what you can to help out. 
* On top of that Laurie and Norman are really involved in this charity for Pancreatic Cancer called [The Lustgarten Foundation.](http://www.lustgarten.org/) 
Any help at all you guys want to give for these great charities would be amazing.

**EDIT: I said it a million times, but if anyone ever wants to know anything that wasn't answered, or if you just don't feel like scrolling through and want to ask again, definitely feel free to message me or comment on this post, I'll periodically check back to make sure no question goes unanswered.
