Alright, so come at me if you must, brethren. Some people here whom I consider friends may no longer like me because of this, or might disagree with me, and for that I am sorry... but I have to get this off my chest.

I have to ask a serious question first

I've recently seen a lot of activity from a user that I have remained wary of since [this huge post 3 months ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPolish/comments/12ty3e/announcement_public_advisory_regarding_a_member/) (P.S. 3 MONTHS AGO, there are numerous posts asking for help, begging for assistance, for food, and more. Feel free to read that PSA again and regard the image from the RAOPizza mod about the money wasted on this person. There are even people who had contacted this user for real life assistance but were denied, which is certainly peculiar; instead she asked them to ""send her pizza"" or something suspicious. [Her answers in the Q&amp;A thread were not helpful in easing the tension](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPolish/comments/12ua3r/menmybabies_question_and_answer_session/?sort=new). Alas, a couple months pass, even since the end of December

Now, by that definition. But this is the type of behavior that SHOULD NOT be welcomed in subreddits like this. This is NOT r/Assistance, nor is it r/PityPolishMePlease. It is RANDOM ACTS. Meaning random gifting using randomizers, winning contests, befriending cool people and gifting them once in a while to show your love, and exchanges. It is not ""post 50 threads over and over bemoaning your life and dumping on us every single instance of shit in your life"" then having a link to your wishlist which mostly consists of very expensive polishes like Butter London and Deborah Lippman. (Really, not a single $4 China Glaze?) There has also been mention of this person PMing others asking them to ""buy her"" polishes from a store she already has near her, either.

Some of you may be regulars in other places like RAOAmazon, their car died, and their favorite movie star died. We can't allow RAOPolish to go down this route.

Did you have a bad day and want to vent to your friends here? Go right ahead, affect you recently? Please let us know. Updates are especially welcome when encouraged. (I'm saying this because I want to make it clear that I'm not talking about people who have recently had sudden tragedies befall them.) We can tell when it's just an OT rant or needing some advice, because you're otherwise probably a chipper and active contributor.

But when almost all of your self-posts are about what's wrong in your life, well-paying job, why are you here buying people things one week, and then the next saying you're too broke to do anything at all?

For those who are bombarded with problems and have little money yet have children to feed... why are you on this subreddit? If that were me, knowing I couldn't give back as well.

If you just want to have people to talk to, or something.

I'm not trying to tell people to quit polishing sob stories. Polish whoever you want, just to subtley start over again.**

Those are my two cents

Hi ! I've seen a bunch of you complain about prices of polish outside the US and, but ain't nobody got money for that :P But if you'd like, I can be your polish middleman of sorts. You can order a polish on US amazon for cheap, have it ship to me (Florida), and I could just ship it to you for around $2. For example, if you want SOTT but don't want to pay the crazy $15 or whatever they're charging elsewhere, you could PM me for my address, and have it sent to me, but I want to be able to do this for as many people as possible and if I used my own money I would only be able to do a few. I could also get brands here that might not be available elsewhere. If this breaks any rules, and /r/closetswap. Plus you would have my address so scamming you wouldn't be very smart on my part :P

LOOK NO FURTHER MO'FUCKAZ!",FggyGggls,57,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPolish/comments/12ko8x/brittle_broken_nails_grand_canyon_style_nail/, ridges, onto bid'niss. 

I think all of us are in agreement that [Biotin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin#Hair_and_nail_problems) is awesome for the peelies/flakies and it is awesome for your skin and hair as well. I take it daily and highly recommend it. If vitamins aren't your bag you would want to invest in a strengthening base coat such as [Essie Protein Base Coat](http://www.amazon.com/Essie-Protein-Basecoat/dp/B0006PJSUC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351965608&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=essie+protein+base+coat)

Have stupid crazy ridges in your nails from biting them for years? Try [Essie Ridge Filling Base Coat](http://www.amazon.com/Essie-Ridge-Filling-Base-Coat/dp/B000Z61UDA/ref=sr_1_10?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351965818&amp;sr=1-10&amp;keywords=ridge+filler)

Are your cuticles pitiful

Of course you can find these types of base coats/strengtheners/cuticle whatnots in whichever brand you prefer

Now onto tricks of the trade! A good [Crystal file](http://www.amazon.com/INTRODUCTION-Premium-Manicure-Crystal-Cheeky-Rainbow/dp/B005WTKB2Q/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351966212&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=crystal+file) will help combat flaking and peeling as long as you file in one direction instead of back and forth, and top coat will ensure that your mani will last longer without chips. Love glitter but hate destroying your nails every time you go to remove it? Try using an [Elmer's Glue base coat](http://wackylaki.blogspot.com/2012/08/tutorial-peel-off-base-coat.html) instead! You'll be able to peel your polish off in one piece and the glue doesn't damage your nails. Win/win fo sho! Have a nasty tear at the base of your nail? Don't cut them all down, instead try the [tea bag technique!](http://wackylaki.blogspot.com/2012/09/tutorial-tuesday-tea-bag-nail-repair.html) This trick has saved my nails so many times, lemme tell ya. 

Lastly, I REPEAT, DO NOT DO THIS. EVER. Polish removers are made to break down polish and that is exactly what it'll do if you mix them together. Let's try 1-3 drops of [Beauty Secrets Polish Thinner](http://www.amazon.com/Beauty-Secrets-Nail-Polish-Thinner/dp/B004F82HB8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351967065&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=beauty+secrets+polish+thinner) instead. You can find this at Sally's for around $5 and it will last forever.  

That is all I can think of for now but feel free to ask questions and any of us here will be happy to help! Also if you think of something I forgot

This is FggyGggls and I approve this wall of text.  

**EDIT:** A good example of how awesome the tea bag trick is! I used to not be able to paint one of my nails because of an accident when I was kid.

They are still at work. Ugh!!!!

I ride all the way back to work. I think really hard about how bad I want these polishes. I decide to just do it. 

I ride back

I get there and they have a lot of the new stuff which I'm happy about. 

I joke with the lady at the cosmetics counter about the crap I went through to buy these. She shows me the different displays and I pick what I want. 

I bring them up with the sales flyer and ask about the 3 polish limit for the $1 off. She tells me she can use it on all of them. ALL OF THEM.

**The weekly ventilation thread will return again in order to keep it all in one area and under control. Beginning on Monday

As previously mentioned, but it has simply become too much. It is understandable to want to share the happenings of your life, both good and bad, with the group, but we all must remember that there is a fine line between sharing personal information amongst friends and coming off as begging to other members. 

As for the MeNMyBabies issues, which rubs many members the wrong way. Frustrating to some? Yes. This is a tricky situation since she has successfully polished many members as well as completed both her polish bomb and Secret Santa requirements. None the less, I respect all opinions and it will be handled by the entire mod team. If she is PMing people and asking for things, that is in direct violation of the rules. Please screenshot me directly if this has happened. We are doing our best to deal with the situation fairly and swiftly.

**In general I do want to remind everyone to please do your due diligence when polishing.**

We are all about the joy of gifting here. I love the way so many of our members embrace others and gift selflessly. With the good nature of so many of our members

While it is certainly wonderful to receive

**If you choose to gift someone because of a negative event in their life, maybe they didn't really break their toe, and maybe ninjas didn't really break into their house and eat all their FunYuns. We will never really know, and unfortunately that is a risk we take when gifting strangers. I advise only gifting others when you are financially able to and when you expect nothing in return.**

Personally, I still enjoy knowing that I made someone's day better whether they deserved it or not in my opinion. 
When committing random acts of kindness in real life, maybe the person in the car behind me in the fast food line who enjoyed a free ice cream cone from me went on to work and embezzled thousands of dollars that day. I'll never know, and that's just fine with me. I've done my part in putting good karma out into the world, and that is how RAoP should be as well.

**Just a few more reminders:**

Please refrain from any postings offering to swap gift cards, ect. Since we are growing at such a fast pace, we must also take steps to limit anything which may open us up for scammers and the like. If you are looking to trade in a gift card, you may want to check out [Cardpool.com.](http://www.cardpool.com) I have not personally used them but they appear to offer the option to trade your gift cards in electronically for an Amazon gift card, which may be helpful for many of you.

If you have nail polish to swap

If you have a panda to swap, so if you could arrange that, that'd be great.

In addition

Lastly

We have just added a mod today who's duties will entail specifically adding contests to the sidebar. The good news is we have so many contests we cannot keep up. The bad news is we have so many contest we cannot keep up. LOL

Hopefully this will solve the issue. :)

I KNOW it's not reddit's weird little vote-balancing thing that keeps out spam because I am now in the negatives. 

I've already said I'd use redditraffle to choose at least one winner. I considered calling off the contest altogether but many people did put effort into responding and I want to give them the chance to be polished as promised. 

I know I am being picky, it looks a little too blue"" or ""too green""s were not criticisms aimed at the people trying to help me, it was more frustration on my part that the color was just so unique that no undies would fit the bill.

I know I shouldn't bitch about downvotes, but I do know I am hesitant to run another contest again after this contest and the LOTR contest are done. Good job. I'll just stick to polishing the people who are nice to me (and those are in plenty) from now on instead of broadening my spectrum to include people who may have been previously to shy to pop up in discussion but want to contribute to a contest thread.

I am way stoked, and this whole thing has been so much fun so far.

1352216287.0,12qe23,[DISCUSSION/CONTEST] My take on recent events,alphabootoo,43,7,87,"I came here to check in on the fun and games of the Election Contests and found the latest news instead. Here is my personal take on things:

I am considerably older than most of you, and it happens more to those with open and generous spirits than it does to those who are suspicious and selfish. Scammers make me furious, but less so for taking my hard earned money than for robbing me of the spirit of kindness that I try very hard to nurture. Every time I get rooked by a scam artist (and it has happened often, in all areas of my life) I spend a long while stewing over it and feeling angry and hurt. But when I do that, I let them win. It means I am giving them not just my money, but control over my thoughts and feelings. And angry and hurt is not who I am! I am someone who makes the effort to make other people happy, whether it be through compliments, or gifts. It's about making the world a better place by promoting that which is positive and turning my back on that which is negative. (And believe me

 If you have been one of those victimized, this wonderful place, cannot be blighted by the reprehensible acts of one conniving thief. The friendship and generosity that illuminate this subreddit are more than adequate to snuff out the tiny little shadow that has crept into our midst. 

I have two quotes to share with you. They are my very favorites, shall pass."" No matter how heavy and dark the clouds may seem, they always do part eventually and the sun will shine again. Okra and her team of mods do a great job of steering this community in a positive direction, and I am very grateful to them for that! The second is a quote from Henry James: “Three things in human life are important: the first is to be kind; the second is to be kind; and the third is to be kind.” Be kind to one another and let's keep RAoP a place of generosity and camaraderie and fun :)

Luckers had commented on my contest

I jokingly said ""you obviously do not know who I am.""

I clearly missed the memo.

From here forward, we must also limit anything which may open us up for scammers and the like. If you are looking to trade in a gift card, you may want to check out Cardpool.com. They appear to offer the option to trade your gift cards in electronically for an Amazon gift card, which may be helpful for many of you.

In that same realm, if you prefer to only gift to those you feel are ""deserving"" or active in the community please be sure to do your due diligence. By checking a members profile or conducting a quick search you will be able to find out if they are an active member or a lurker before making your decision whether you would like to gift that person.

1352322033.0,12tg6p,ANNOUNCEMENT,OkraWimprey,45,12,127,"Firstly, I am hoping to talk with IWF soon to discuss the options and reach an agreement on what needs to happen. When a decision has been reached

I do want you to know that I appreciate the fact that many people are attempting to come up with a solution that will please everyone. Any posts stating my ""plan"" are incorrect. I do not have a plan just yet

For those that disapprove of the timing of my previous announcement, I did not feel that Monday was the best time to present this unfortunate information in its entirety to the group. Based on the fact that I would be gone working an 18 hour day Tuesday without any sleep the night before, I did not think it would be a wise decision to drop a bomb on everyone then have to disappear leaving the group confused and upset. Unfortunately, against my better judgement I had no choice but to do this since she was going to be exposed on another subreddit and out of respect I did want to make sure that you all heard from me first.

As I predicted, therefore avoiding all of the confusion. It is unfortunate that some members took things upon themselves to provide false information and rile the group up unnecessarily.

While some members seem to feel an announcement should have been made the very second I was able to confirm she was guilty, although I wish that it was. Passwords needed to be changed, email addresses needed to be reclaimed, spreadsheets needed to be recreated, access to certain elements needed to be revoked and all of it needed to be done swiftly and in tandem. Trust me when I say that this was no easy task, and quite a bit of work. 

Many members have been betrayed by the actions of IWF, our caring and generous members give what they can afford to give to others randomly, with no reciprocation expected. This is what makes RandomActsOfPolish such a wonderful and special place. While I know that we would all like to believe those we polish randomly are ""deserving"" so to speak, the reality is that some may be, and unfortunately some may not. This is a risk we all take when gifting to online friends and strangers. The upside is the joy we receive from knowing that we did something wonderful for someone else, whether they truly deserve it or not. As long as all we expect in return is our own joy from selfless acts then we will all remain fulfilled.

In addition, it cannot even be broken. This was proven by how quickly the entire group came together to help polish those that were effected. I refuse to allow the hurtful actions of one person to change everything we are about and everything we are known for. Trust me, this is one big dark cloud but I hope you can also trust me that there will be ONE GIANT silver lining as we come together stronger than ever.

**EDIT: The other mods and I have decided that the best conclusion to this fiasco is to let each person involved deal with IWF directly in order to rectify the situation. IWF has agreed that those affected by her actions can get in touch with her directly and work out what is best for each individual person. Her public apology is expected soon.**

It's summer now

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this

I found those fake nails that you can glue on your regular toenails; and they're even meant for toes, to be honest, sucks. It doesn't stick to skin, at all, and can really irritate your nail beds. So that's not really an option for the long term.

Recently

Just spray some on your toes (a decent amount) and then apply the toenail. Press down for about thirty seconds

I tried it with my toenails (and there's no chance for fungus or anything disgusting because this is meant for your skin and locking out moisture), normal nails.

I know that this subreddit is mostly for manicures and polish

As a side note

Really
