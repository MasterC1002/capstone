These last few years I feel the Lakers and Celtics are very similar in the ways that they have aging and injured players that play hard but are losing some respect. Both our teams are proud franchises in a struggle but stay true to playing hard and sticking to business. 
I just love the way the Celtics punked the cocky Knicks last night. Even if the Celtics lose this series they showed them what a tough experienced team can do and forced them to show some respect. That's a win to me for all the old school teams. I'm rooting for you guys and the Spurs out of respect for the older teams that play hard and with respect. 
Feel free to down vote me if you must because I still like hating you guys. However I've always got respect for your franchise and now your team especially after last night. ",self,t5_2qmkf,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/1djjuv/good_job_celtics_from_a_lakers_fan/

**What are the Salary Cap and Luxury Tax levels going to be?**

The cap and tax figures are based on a percentage of the leagues basketball related income (BRI) for the league season so we don't know exactly yet.

A few months ago Stern made some comment about revenues hitting $5B which would be huge because this season was based on a BRI of $4.3B. If that were the case

**What's this thing about a ""worse luxury tax"" I hear about?**

Starting next season the luxury tax becomes more punitive with scaled rates. Up to now, would owe $85M in tax instead of $30M. Also, a ""repeater"" penalty kicks in two seasons from now so it is in the interest of all teams to not be over the tax season after season. 

**Total Tax Bill**|
|:---:

Amount Over Tax|2012/13|2013/14 Scaled|2014/15 Repeater
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
**$5M**|$5M|$7.5M|$12.5M
**$10M**|$10M|$16.25M|$26.25M
**$15M**|$15M|$28.75M|$43.73M
**$20M**|$20M|$45M|$65M
**$25M**|$25M|$63.75M|$88.75M
**$30M**|$30M|$85M|$115M


**How does our current roster stack up against those figures?**

At the moment,697** next season. There is basically no way that we will hold all those contracts at the beginning of next season, though.

Player|Salary
|:---|---:|
Paul Pierce|	15
Kevin Garnett|	12
Rajon Rondo|	11
Jeff Green|	8
Brandon Bass|	6
Courtney Lee|	5
Jason Terry|	5
Avery Bradley|	2
Jared Sullinger|	1
Fab Melo|	1
Jordan Crawford|	2
Terrence Williams|	947
Shavlik Randolph|	1
DJ White|	1
**TOTAL**|**76

This would have us way over the salary cap, which doesn't make much sense for ownership.

**What are Danny's options at the beginning of the process?**

*Paul Pierce:* The team has the option to buy-out Paul's contract before July 1 and owe him ""only"" $5M. This would make him a free agent and we would only be able to offer him the league minimum or one of our cap exceptions to bring him back. That **$5M** would be what Paul is paid and would stay on our balance sheet. We could also amnesty him in which case he would be paid $15M but none of the money would be on our balance sheet. He would then go into an auction where any team under the cap could bid for his services. We would not be allowed to re-sign him for at least one year.

*Kevin Garnett:* KG's contract is guaranteed. If he retires before July 1 then he is owed nothing and is not on our balance sheet. If he retires after that we would still hold the **$12.4M** in the calculations but could arrange a buy-out. The way he could come back to play for us

*China Three:* Williams, or use our cap exceptions.~~ Their non-guarnteed contracts total **3,082,272**. *EDIT: I originally read the salary table incorrectly. They are already on minimum contracts so we would only save money by signing undrafted rookie free agents in their place, which won't happen.*

**Why don't we just renegotiate cap friendly contracts?**

I see this mentioned a lot but it's not allowed in the NBA. Under very specific circumstances a team under the cap can renegotiate with a player to increase their salary but we're above the cap and renegotiated contracts are not allowed to go down in value. This is allowed in the NFL where a hard cap exists

**Um

Basically we have options that would allow the team to clear up to $18.4M off our balance sheet by amnestying Paul and cutting the China Three. If KG also retired that would remove an additional $12.4M for a total savings of $30.8M. That would bring our committed salaries down below **$46M**

**So you're saying we could sign players

No, the 16th in the first round needs to be added in at **$1.4M.** We also have to add in roster holds because we wouldn't have enough players signed. There are also holds associated with long gone players that could be cleared up easily and holds for the roster exceptions like the MLE and BAE that could not be. In reality, we would be a few million below the cap, depending on where exactly it lands.

In order to sign a big name free agent we would need to amnesty Paul

**I don't like this game. What are our options?**

*Paul and KG come back:* Our big signing is Rondo, Mini Mid-Level (MMLE) or Bi-Annual (BAE) Exceptions to sign a free agent. We would also use our draft pick, likely on a position of need like center.

*Paul and/or KG are traded:* There are teams out there that would trade for either or both of Paul and Kevin. The Clippers, too. Trading KG is difficult because he might retire but if he agrees to a trade and to play one more season there would be suitors. Paul is easier to trade because he's already said he'll play on. Any trade scenario would likely bring back contracts so our free agent moves would still be limited but this would reshape the team immediately.

*KG retires and Paul is waived/amnestied:* Depending on other factors,False,self,t5_2qmkf,1367836594.0,,logo-95,t3_1dod5w

1373543399.0,1i2p2s,Where our roster stands right now... something else is going to happen soon,dangercart,73,7,19,"With the big trade and some draft day moves our team is overloaded on players right now but also holds some remaining pieces that could have an impact this season so I thought I'd do a little roster re-set for mid Summer League.

**Roster**

* We currently have 18 players signed or under draft rights. To start the season we must be down to at most 15 players.

Guaranteed Contract|Non-Guaranteed Contract|Draft Rights Only
|:---|:---|:---|
Humphries|Randolph|Iverson (Not that one)
Rondo|White| 
Wallace|Joseph| 
Green|Pressey| 
Bass| | 
Lee| | 
Bogans| | 
Bradley| | 
Crawford| | 
Olynyk| | 
Sullinger| | 
Melo| | 
Brooks| | 

Thirteen of those players are on guaranteed contracts so unless we make another move or eat a contract by waiving a player with a guaranteed deal we can carry at most two of Randolph, Pressey and Iverson. All but Iverson would become free agents if they aren't on the team; there are rumors that Iverson will go play in Europe so we'd retain his draft rights but he wouldn't be on our roster if that happens.

**Free Agents**

Our only active free agent from last year's team is Chris Wilcox. We still have his Early Bird Rights and he has not been renounced or signed with anyone else. It doesn't look like he'll be back but we could also release Shav and sign Wilcox to a minimum contract if we wanted to. It would have no financial impact. If you like that

**Where does that put us**

If we were to do what currently looks most likely and keep Shav and Pressey

Metric|	Total
|:---|	---:|
Current Contracts:|	$71
Amount Over Cap:|	36
Amount Over Tax Line:|	326
Tax Bill:|	489
Total Team Spend:|	72
Roster Count:|	15
Status:|	Taxpayer Below Apron
Build Result:|	Pass

Because we landed just slightly above the tax line last year we are now guaranteed to be classified as a ""repeater"" next season with the higher tax penalties that brings. That will only apply to 2014-15 if we can get under the line this year and next. As we are rebuilding

**So then what?**

The tax is calculated as of the last day of the season so we could start the season like this and just fix it during the year. However, which is normal, but we'd still be right up against the tax line and that would cause problems.

**Other Assets**

We still have some bullets in the gun if Danny wants to use them. The three main ones are:

* The full Mid-level Exception (MLE), so that's not an issue. The bigger problem is that it's still vital we stay below the tax line so a salary clearing move would have to happen before there is any consideration of using this.

* The Bi-annual Exception (BAE)

* A $7.4M trade exception created by the Pierce/Garnett/Terry trade. This allows us to take up to $7.4M more back in salary than we send out in any trade made over the next year, unless we're just facilitating a move for other teams.

**What's all that mean**

In the end, despite not being competitive right now. Something else is coming up soon. It might be as simple as using our trade exception to facilitate a sign-and-trade among other teams where we dump a player we don't want (I'm looking at you, Fabricio) or something a little more significant like a trade where we are able to dump a real salary. As always, it could be something really big like a Rondo trade but I doubt that happens before he's back on the floor.

EDIT 8:15: Just got home from the car dealer. I had some bolts that froze in my sidearm or something like that and had to pay $600 to fix it. Seeing all these great questions made me feel much better! I'll answer during timeouts and halftime so I can have them all answered before the post game show. I'm on this subreddit every day reading all your posts and comments (and commenting and posting myself) so I'll keep answering these questions for the rest of the internets. I do have to get off after the game though because I'm hosting the post game and then going to see Trance with my girlfriend. NO SPOILERS!

I'll be the special guest host on the CLNS Radio Celtics Post Game Show tonight after the game. You can listen on [CelticsBlog](http://www.celticsblog.com) and [CLNS Radio](http://www.clnsradio.com). Be sure to call in 347-215-7771 so we can talk!

Here's the link to The Garden Report and Three at the Buzzer. Please watch, I'm always trying to make the show better for the viewers.
____________________________

Whattup r/BostonCeltics?! I'll be here at 1:30 PM ET to start answering questions but had to make the post now before I left the crib. 

Ask me whatever you want about the Celtics, whatever (as long as they are super personal and make me dig down into a deep emotional place). I won't be able to answer questions about stuff that's off the record, because...well...it wouldn't be off the record anymore. But if there's a question that I can't answer, I'll find a way to satisfy the question as best as I can.

Here's [proof](https://twitter.com/CLNS_JaredWeiss/status/323096565864599552) that it's me and NOT THAT FAKE ASS MORGAN FREEMAN.

You can also tweet me @CLNS_JaredWeiss if you want. Keep it sexy Reddit.

Some background on me: I have been the Celtics Locker Room Reporter for CLNS Radio for a couple years and created The Garden Report Post Game Show in partnership with SB Nation and Celtics Blog. I also host a radio show called The Block Party on Thursday nights at 8 PM on [CLNS Radio] (http://clnsradio.com)
I've talked to the majority of NBA stars and have covered the draft and the conference finals. 

Personally, hip hop and turkey sandwiches and waste most of my free time doing two of those things at the same time.

So Ask me anything!

EDIT 1:30: I'm here now

I'm not a Celtic fan

The first thing some may not know, Olynyk mostly hovered near the 3 point line and hit jump shots when open. He was not a true post player at all. This is understandable if you know about his history, particularly the fact that he was a very late bloomer and only became tall enough to be a post player his senior year of high school (and continued growing after that). In High School he was a point guard, so the transition he was forced to make after he suddenly sprouted 8+ inches was not an easy one to make.

The much publicized red shirt year was a direct result of Olynyk finally buying into the fact that he had to learn to be a true post player, both offensively and defensively.

**Why you should be excited**:

* There's a lot of untapped potential. The fact he's as far progressed as he is after really only being a post player one year is quite remarkable. His offensive game can look like a thing of beauty at times

* Having been a PG previously

* The range on his shot is better than it looks if you are strictly looking at the numbers. Mark Few forced Olynyk to stay in the post 99% of the time

**Why you shouldn't be excited**:

* While you can't discount his intensity, to 1.2 over his last 21 games. He is improving.

* Some of his post moves look like they'd be eaten up by an athletic big

* One of the reasons he didn't always play big minutes was because of foul trouble. Part of that was because Few treated him with kiddy gloves and would yank him after getting two fouls in the first half and the other part is because he's apt to getting ticky tack soft fouls. I think the fact he's so new to being in the post is partially to blame

**Conclusion:** Take what I say with a grain of salt, but I believe there's a lot more there. ",,False,self,t5_2qmkf,1372822766.0,,

You may remember back in February when /r/BostonCeltics was [redesigned for the first time](http://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/p8hfx/rbostonceltics_has_a_new_design/). Well

The design focussed around having the TD Garden floor as the background and a header that shows off the greats of the team we all love dearly. Here's what has changed:

* New header
* New flair! You wanted jerseys
* New comment jerseys. [](/9) All players and retired numbers are featured. Just use the format of [].(/number) (remove the ""."")
* New

There's a few other little tweaks and whatnot around too

A note on flair: All existing flair assignments have been removed. Sorry about that

Also, please let me know if something doesn't display correctly in your browser or just looks odd. A screenshot and your OS/browser would be very handy. I'm keen to stamp out all bugs, so leave a comment here if you see something.

Finally, helping design the header and making decisions when I couldn't. I thank them all for their help!

This was literally the best decision I have ever made in my life. I walk into the garden, I hear the crowd. I hear the ""Paaaaulll Pieeeerrrceee!"" and the ""K-----G--- Kevin Garnett!""s from the announcer. Hearing ""Crazy Train"" right before the game started. I felt home. 

This game literally made me lose my voice. I had many moments when my heart almost stopped and I should probably go see a cardiologist soon. The crowd was so energetic

(Actually

The moments in this game were incredible. Paul Pierce and Jeff Green hitting the clutch threes. KG firing up from out of nowhere. It was amazing. The thriller continued until the game finally ended, they came from Europe and were screaming, trash talking, being nitty-gritty Boston sports fans. The heart and soul of the Celtics is the fans. No one left at any point. All the fans stuck with the C's, helping them win.

Anyways, for being the best fans out there.

Grab yourself some custom Celtics flair by clicking ""edit"" nest to your name i the side bar. There's a nice selection of logos and jerseys. If you have any other suggestions for Flair

Now, so I highly encourage anyone to let us know your thoughts, comments, bugs and criticisms. This is our community and everyone's opinion counts.

There's a few more things I would like add and polish a little

**PREVIEW**

Yesterday we saw the Thunder square up a series that looked to be going all the Spurs way. Tonight, I believe). If the Celtics win, all of a sudden we have a three game series and the Celtics have plenty of momentum.

The teams should go in unchanged

The Celtics will be hoping for continued success from their bench, had one of their better games of the season. The Heat will be hoping to bounce back and get more from Wade, who came back angry after his last quiet game. Thankfully game three was merely average, not quiet for him, so we might be spared the worst of it.

Personally

Go Celtics!

1358371958.0,16pihn,The Eastern Conference has gone haywire,dangercart,26,1,13,"As we near the midway point of the season (teams have played between 35-40 games) it seems the Eastern Conference has gone insane and we might be back to the state of the league we had in the early 00's where the East is WAY weaker than the West.  Despite our rough play through the first 30 games

* [Hollinger's Team Power Rankings has the FIVE best teams in the Western Confernce.](http://espn.go.com/nba/hollinger/powerrankings)
* Miami's record would make them fourth in the West and they've gone 4-6 over their last ten despite playing teams with a .448 total winning percentage.  They're fighting amongst themselves and dumping games even when LeBron dominates.  It probably won't matter but they look vulnerable at the moment.
* The Knicks are also 4-6 over the past ten despite playing under .500 competition and yet still are in second in the East and lead the Atlantic.  Their average age is approximately 162 and you've got to figure some of that age will show in the second half of the season.
* Indiana is moving up because they never give up points.  Either/both their defense has to slide or their offense has to improve (they seem unsustainably good and bad
* The Nets are lighting up crap competition and I always figured they would be a bigger threat than NYK just based on age but they have the most advantageous home/road schedule in the league to this point and I don't think they'll keep it up when the schedule turns against them.
* Chicago is solid but, really good coach.
* Atlanta's falling apart against a terrible schedule and getting absolutely blown out every few games.  They look like a mess.  Hollinger's stats think they're the 23rd best team in the NBA.
* Milwaukee are bizarrely constructed and would be something like 13th in the West.  The East sucks so they're a playoff team because...
* No one else in the East is over .500 or within four games of the Bucks!  The rest of the teams in the East are HORRIBLE and

I say all this because I think our terrible conference means that, if we can get past the Nets, the game against the Pacers could be for home court in the second round.

* 25 females responded to this survey! (I might be only mentioning this because I was one of them).
* We have fairly strong representation (percentage-wise) in Canada
* We have one fine gentleman representing us from the 51+ age group. Someone get this man a crown or something.
* In the U.S., California, New York, and New Jersey.
* **SURPRISE!** The top two most hated teams are the Miami Heat and the Los Angeles Lakers. I must admit
* THREE of you (and you know who you are!) say that your most hated team is the Boston Celtics. All three of you say you subscribe to this sub. Um...thank you? 
* I am jealous of all of you (47) that got to attend a game at the old Boston Garden. I wish my parents had the common sense to take me when I was younger. :)
* More of you subscribe to /r/bostonceltics than /r/nba. Aww
* A fair amount of you participate in the game threads! It's good to know the efforts aren't going unnoticed. :)

**PREVIEW**

I think that the winner of tonight's game will win the series. Simply put, then the game 6 result may not matter, as they have game 7 at home. Tonight is key.

The big 3 have never lost a game 5 when coming in tied at 2, tonight will be tough.

The Celtics will go in unchanged

Sean Grande: [Spoelstra says Chris Bosh will not start in Game 5

A. Sherrod Blakely: [Erik Spoelstra on Bosh. ""If he's able to go tonight or if it's the next game

The hesitation

The Celtics need to come out early and set the tempo and let the Heat know they're here to play. Despite them regularly giving up big leads

Thanks to everyone who voted in our 2013 Player Awards. We had a massive 160 responses! And only 10 joke votes (we could tell - they voted Fab Melo for rookie of the year!). So

##Rookie of the Year

[Results](http://i.imgur.com/ZgpjofL.png)

A clear victory to Jared Sullinger who not only had little competition, potentially costing him a spot on the 1st All Rookie team.

##Best First Year Celtic

[Results](http://i.imgur.com/F98R8tM.png)

Another decent win for Sullinger. Before the seasons started, Sullinger scooped the award and surprised everyone.

##Defensive Player of the Year

[Results](http://i.imgur.com/ICu5MUp.png)

A good battle between Bradley and KG


##Most Improved Player

[Results](http://i.imgur.com/lwQFpp3.png)

With so many new players, Bradley missing a lot of games and Bass regressing, Green was the clear winner. DJ White scored a single vote. Odd.


##Sixth Man of the Year

[Results](http://i.imgur.com/OptgO4Z.png)

Pre-season we talked up Terry as a possible Sixth man of the year winner for the NBA vote

##Most Valuable Player

[Results](http://i.imgur.com/07GUjen.png)

Our closest contest and a battle of the two veterans! KG was victorious and Pierce a close second

Variance is a good thing for underdogs such as Houston, you want to be consistently good so you limit your risk of an upset. But you know who shot more 3-pointers than the Rockets this season? That's right, the Knicks.

However, which would be OK if Anthony was a metronome of efficiency. Instead, he was the most volatile scorer in the NBA this season, according to his game-by-game variance in the points column. For a guy who relies so heavily on contested jumpers, the Knicks have been needlessly handcuffed to Anthony's brand of basketball.

Consider this: Anthony has shot an NBA-high 69 midrange jumpers in the playoffs, Anthony has taken more midrange jumpers than the Heat (67 in four games), Bucks (66 in four games) and Rockets (46 in five games)**.

This bears repeating: Anthony has taken 23 more midrange shots than the entire Rockets team. Maybe it shouldn't be a surprise that the stathead Rockets have been allergic to the most inefficient shot in the game. For a favorite like the Knicks

The result is that Anthony has posted the highest usage rate by far among any player in the playoffs (39.7 percent), will gladly allow Anthony to take jumper after jumper if it means efficient scorers like Raymond Felton (who has been fantastic in this series), Tyson Chandler and Steve Novak have to watch from the periphery.

The Knicks' offense is unhealthy right now. For all of the talk about how coach Mike Woodson revamped the offense this season with more passing,,False,self,t5_2qmkf,False,,True

**PREVIEW**

We're back in Boston and have our best chance of winning a game in this series. The Celtics have some momentum from a really strong second game, but not impossible.

Everyone is expected to play

Last game I hoped that Rondo would score less and dish more. He dropped 44 points on the Heat. I'm not going to make any suggestions tonight, KG can dominate in close, Pierce to get back to being the Truth and Rondo to do whatever it is that Rondo wants to do.

We can win this game and have some confidence going into game 4.

The Excel workbook I use to keep track of our roster can be downloaded from [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/89641339/BostonCeltics_SalaryRoster_dangercart.xls).

**CBA Concepts:**

* **Salary Cap:** I see a lot of confusion around the salary cap and ""cap space."" The salary cap for this year was just over $58M. If it were to stay roughly the same next year, because of cap holds. Barring a major salary dump trade, which I'll explain the difficulty of in a second, we won't have any cap space until 2015, no matter what happens with Paul and KG. In 2015, Rondo and Bradley will be up for free agency so if they are performing it will take up all our space to sign them.

* **Luxury Tax:** The real concern for us is not the salary cap,223,266 above the luxury tax line. That means that we pay that amount out in a penalty if our roster is exactly as it is at the end of the season. That's not a huge deal expect for...

* **Tax Escalators:** When people talk about the importance of getting under the tax line, that would make our tax bill over $3M this season. If Paul and KG are back next season there is very little chance we'll be under the tax threshold so it would benefit the ownership if we were to make a salary dump trade this season. Alternatively, we could buy out Paul at the end of the season but then he would most likely play somewhere else next year. If you are a fan who wants KG and Paul to retire with the Celtics, you also need to accept that we are going to make a salary dump trade or are expecting the owners to pay a huge tax bill next season (and probably an even bigger one in years beyond).

* **Apron Cap:** Another element of the CBA is that,307,000. Early in the season we were VERY close to this line but because of some cuts and buyouts we're now, by my count, $2,967,210 below it. The previous and next concepts will make this somewhat moot but it's important to remember if you see rumored trades where we're taking back big expiring contracts.

* **Trade Exceptions:** Because we are over the cap, the total additional salary would still also have to be less than $2,967,210 to keep us below the cap. These rules are what the [ESPN Trade Machine](http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine) checks.

**Current situation:**

We currently have 13 players under contract. Two of them are out for the season and a third has played three total minutes in the NBA.  We're capped out for the foreseeable future

To realistically make it through the rest of the season we need to sign 1-2 more players to minimum contracts (ownership would have to pay a 1-to-1 tax on those salaries

**Options:**

* **The case for keeping Paul and KG:**

Fans have different reasons for following sports and it's entirely possible that you value the overall experience of following a team more than the blind pursuit of a title. Keeping Paul here certainly has sentimental value to fans in that group so I'm going to put that group aside and say

To everyone else, or he still won't retire a Celtic. We have certainly played well in the last week so if you think we can make a small trade that sends out one of Green, Bass, Terry or Lee and brings back multiple players, or you think we can find serviceable free agents on the market today, and that those moves make us a contender, then you have an argument for keeping the team together. If we do that and do not ALSO dump a little salary this year

* **The case for trading Paul and/or KG:**

Sentimentality aside

The reality is that Paul is only going to retire a Celtic if we pay him $16M next season and then give him another contract for a smaller amount. KG will probably play one more season but we'll still owe him money after that in 2015 so he won't clear our books until after that. If he plays two more years

That means we're looking at this group through next season

In 2014/15 KG will probably have retired and we'll owe the guaranteed part of his contract.  Paul will have re-signed partly so he can retire here and partly because we have his Bird rights and can't sign anyone else who is as good.  It will be absolutely critical that we stay below the tax threshold so we won't have much room to maneuver.  Draft picks and cap holds will take us well above the salary cap so the MLE and trades will be our only way to get established players.

In 2015/16 we'll probably be in the last year of Paul's contract, Bradley and Bass will be FA's who we have Bird rights to.  Sullinger and Melo will be in their last year before becoming RFA's.  Our signings and picks from the next few seasons will bring us right up to the cap, unless Rondo is not being re-signed.  Keeping Paul to retirement makes this the armageddon season where we probably fall apart, barring a very good trade or draft pick, which certainly could happen along the way, or Bradley and/or Sullinger improve beyond what I think most people believe their ""ceiling"" is.  Those are definite possibilities and any number of trades could happen but this is how a full ""keep it together"" strategy plays out.

So that's the story.  The CBA really ties our hands and keeping Paul and KG probably means 2-3 years of making the playoffs but not contending followed by a total rebuild.  Trading them forgoes the fun of seeing them retire here but also accelerates the breakup so we can get more opportunities to find a gem in the draft or a trade.  I believe in trying to trade them but I'm not saying one path is right. I'm just saying those are the two most likely paths to choose from and it probably depends on what you like to root for and just how bullish you are on our team after the past week.",self,t5_2qmkf,1360152092.0,,logo-95,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/17ytuk/trade_deadline_month_cba_info_team_breakup/

1340982233.0,vsps8,Long post on potential roster composition that I did while sitting on a conference call,dangercart,24,1,24,"Now that the draft is done and free agency is about to begin we can start to see the formation of our team if we make a few assumptions.  I can't figure out if this was actually given final approval but I believe game day rosters have permanently been expanded from 12 to 13 players.  This was done for the condensed 66 game schedule but I think it is now permanent.

**Assumptions**

* Kevin Garnet will re-sign with the Celtics
* Jeff Green will sign with the Celtics
* The Celtics will sign both of their first round picks
* The Celtics will sign their second round pick

**Roster at the Opening of Free Agency (after assumptions)**

* PG:  Rajon Rondo
* SG:  Avery Bradley
* SF:  Paul Pierce
* PF:  Kevin Garnett
* C:  Fab Melo

**Roster Needs**

1. 3-point shooting from guard position
2. Veteran Center
3. Veteran Power Forward
4. Wing defender
5. Back-up Point Guard

**Cap Position**
Our cap position is in flux based on cap holds for Garnett, we will have space but not a ton of it.

**Thoughts on Some of Last Season's Players**

* Ray Allen:  A few weeks ago I thought Ray was definitely gone.  Now I'm wondering if Danny tries to bring him back just because we desperately need a 3-point shooter on our bench.  Rumors are that he is going to Miami but they can only offer him $3M/year and he'll be a bench player there
* Brandon Bass:  The Sullinger pick makes committing $7-8M to Bass a questionable proposition.  We do need three playable PF's and Jeff Green's ability to take minutes there in order to keep Garnett's regular season minutes down.  I think it is likely that Bass is not re-signed.
* Mikael Pietrus:  We need a veteran wing defender and Pietrus fits the bill.  He isn't my favorite player but he
* JuJuan Johnson:  It's very difficult to determine how much progress Johnson made last season but it is difficult to see where his minutes will come from.  Sullinger is a better post player and Green is better as the ""stretch 4.""  We will probably look for a low salary
* Keyon Dooling:  We need a veteran back-up PG and Dooling did a good job with that roll.  He showed good on ball defending skills and made friends with Rondo.  Ideally he will be back on a similar contract to what he had last season.
* Greg Stiemsma:  He is a fan favorite but either his or Ryan Hollins's minutes (or both) are going to Fab Melo.  He is a restricted free agent so if anyone else offers him basically any money I would not expect the Celtics to match the offer.
* Marquis Daniels:  Four contracts in four years?  Probably not.
*  Jermaine O'Neal:  I hate you.

**Free Agent Priorities**

1.  Center:  We have been linked to Omer Asik and that makes a lot of sense.  There aren't great options but if the Sullinger pick allows us to let Bass go to save money at PF then we can put some more salary here.  Spencer Hawes would be another good option if we want an offensive option instead of Asik's defense.  Chris Kaman would be a still more expensive option but I don't think he brings much more than Hawes.  The Pacers will match anything for Hibbert.  Best guess:  Omer Asik.
2.  3-point Shooting SG:  As stated above
3.  Power Forward:  Brandon Bass would still be a very good option but we have to prioritize dollars and I don't think this is the place to spend them.  There are a ton of options here

**Proposed Roster**

* PG:  Rondo
* SG:  Bradley, Moore (D League)
* SF:  Pierce, Joseph (D League)
* PF:  Garnett
* C:  Expensive FA

Sending Moore and Joseph to the D-League gives us a 14 man roster with two players on the shuttle.  Our game day roster would take care of itself based on injuries most nights but the obvious player to de-activate would be the third SG.

**Potential Rotation**

* Starters:  Rondo, Garnett, FA Center
* Sixth Men:  Green
* Rotation:  Sullinger

I would be really happy with that.  More depth and athleticism than last year but less production out of KG and Pierce.  We'd be favorites in the division again and, Bradley, Green, Sullinger and Melo.",,False,self,False,t3_vsps8

**PREVIEW**

Here we are again

Everyone is expected to play tonight (with obvious exceptions of Bradley

The key to the game for the Celtics is limiting the Heat's superstars

I can't help but feeling that the Celtics have nothing to lose tonight. They are not expected to win in Miami, like it did in the Heat-Pacers series. I'm just hoping for a good, solid effort. If we give that, we're a good chance to win.

From that I mean Ainge is there trying to work out a good deal including Bledsoe while your coach is talking to the other team telling them not to include him in any deal.

This is an A+ offseason in my opinion.  What do you think?

[ShamSports.com](http://www.shamsports.com/content/pages/data/salaries/celtics.jsp) has updated their salary index for 2012 so we are starting to see exactly how Danny and the C's front office pulled off what is, this wasn't like the Heat getting LeBron and Bosh or like when we got KG and Ray but it is a pretty remarkable exercise in planning, negotiating and executing a complete roster construction under less than ideal starting circumstances.

For anyone who is interested

**Concepts in Building a Roster**

* The salary cap is the most common CBA concept you hear about in the media but it is probably now the least important of the three benchmark figures.  In past years a team could clear their entire cap, Miami).  The new rules establishing a ""hard cap"" on teams that take certain actions and the punitive luxury tax is changing that and it is going to become increasingly difficult to build a super team through free agency.  There are very few players left who can be amnestied so that cap space use is also going away.

* The luxury tax line is now more important.  Because the luxury tax rate has increased so much, Nets, LAL, temporarily Miami) willing to go far beyond it.  We will pay the tax this year, but not too much of it.

* The ""Apron"" amount that is currently $4M beyond the luxury tax line is now the most important value for building roster depth.  This season, that goes out the window and teams below this threshold have a significant advantage both in free agency and in negotiating trades.

* In the past, but not stars, on their rookie contract will become vital as concepts like the hard cap and punitive luxury tax come into play.  Having a star player on a rookie contract is still just about the biggest advantage an NBA team can have.  We should feel very good about our history of drafting contributing players at basically all spots in the draft.

* The rules around minimum contracts are having the desired affect.  The stipulation that all minimum contract players, Dooling and Collins.  Without that provision we would either have had to sign first and second year players for those roster spots or to not trade for Courtney Lee.

* The Sign-and-Trade rules are working pretty well.  They have made it more difficult for a star player like Dwight Howard to force his way out while still allowing a player like Courtney Lee to get fair market value in a good situation.  The value of a non-guaranteed contract actually gives a slight jump in value to a player like Kris Joseph

**How Danny Made this Work**

*Rajon Rondo:*  Committing to Rondo and signing him to his long term deal is probably Danny's best move as GM, like he would have been if he waited out his rookie contract, it would have made it impossible to build a team as good as we have.

*Avery Bradley:*  Rondo is the best non-rookie contract.  If Bradley gets healthy and plays like he did last year

*KG:*  At first I assumed that Garnett's contract would be back-loaded but apparently it is not.  We made up for this by back-loading Bass's contract instead.  KG's willingness to come back at a below market rate was the second domino to fall

*Sullinger and Melo:*  I think the team trusts that Sullinger can give us something productive this season.  Having a cheap rotation forward fall to us was a big stroke of luck.  Melo is a flier that we could afford because we had two picks.

*Jeff Green:* It looks like his contract will be a straight $9M/year for four years but it is not signed yet.  This is probably the worst contract we'll have on the books and it is somewhat troubling how long it goes for.  If the league revenues increase and inflates the tax line over the next four years it will be less of a problem.

*Brandon Bass:* The next domino was Bass agreeing to take a back-loaded contract.  This allowed us to stay under the hard cap this season.  If Sham Sports is right

*Jason Terry:*  This is a pretty straightforward deal but his ability to play more effectively at PG than Ray helps the eventual composition of the team and it seems like Danny and Doc had thought about that.  The decision to offer anyone the MLE and trigger the hard cap was the fourth important point in the offseason.

*Chris Wilcox:*  Wilcox agreeing to come back for one year at the minimum is important because it is hard to find competent bigs at that price.  Using the MLE on Terry basically guaranteed that KG would have to start at center so having an established back-up was going to be important.  He will make $1.35M but only costs us $850K and that is all that counts against the hard cap.  Knowing this position was filled allowed us to spend our remaining dollars on Courtney Lee instead of a more expensive big man.

*Courtney Lee:*  This is a wonderfully constructed trade.  I have no doubt that Lee had an offer from someone for the full MLE in his pocket and was willing to take it if we couldn't match.  Giving up JJJ and the Bobcat's pick was an easy decision but that doesn't come close to making a salary match.  The non-guaranteed second years on the contracts we gave to Moore and Williams last year became vital trade chips because we could use them to build a salary match without needing anyone to actually want the players.  This is one reason that Kris Joseph is very likely to make the team and be on it all year.  Finding someone to take Pavlovic for a couple of second rounders becomes an easy deal once you know he is taking the minimum.  Having Wilcox signed at back-up center makes the dollars available.

*Jason Collins and Keyon Dooling:*  The last step was to fill in the back-end roster spots.  Once it was clear that the BAE wouldn't be enough for (or maybe worth) Greg Stiemsma we needed a veteran back-up center.  I don't like Collins but it doesn’t really matter.  Getting Dooling to agree to take the minimum for one year could be completely irrelevant to our team or a real coup.

*Smith and Christmas:*  Christmas may very well make the team out of camp if Bradley isn't ready to play.  I would expect both of them to spend more time in Maine (or on another team) than in Boston.

*Bi-annual Exception:* Amazingly

**Preview**

Tonight the Celtics have a chance to wrap up the series and perhaps earn a day or so of extra rest

The C's have played 1.5 great games in Philly this series and had it not been for a woeful third quarter

Bradley is warming up

Rondo and Garnett are fresh off their Second All-Defensive team selections and will be here to show the Sixers why. Tough game ahead

Last season /u/tdm911, retirements and all the other roster moves a GM has at their disposal.

Please note

**Download the** [**Excel Model**](http://bit.ly/1801RYK)

**Go to the** [**Web App**](http://tinyurl.com/rosterbuild)

*If you have Excel installed on your computer we suggest you use that version as it has some features that makes the tool easier to work with. If not

The model works by having you select a team for which the current roster populates. From there, signing and trade in the yellow cells. As you make decisions, the workbook will populate those players into ""downstream"" sections (so a free agent you decide to re-sign will automatically appear in the next section to enter their salary). At the end, your roster will be collected and your cap, tax and team spend amounts will be calculated. The workbook will also tell you if you passed some basic CBA tests to tell if all your decisions are valid under league rules. You can move back-and-forth through the tool to see how one decision impacts others and to try to reach a point where we can sign the players you want.

As the season isn't over yet and this is just a beta version

* The Cap is set at $60M with a $73M tax line

* The draft is just a mock from draft-express.com because I need to capture the salaries. The players are just placeholders.

* As with last season's tool

* Salary information is taken from [ShamSports.com](http://data.shamsports.com/content/pages/data/salaries/index.jsp)

So that's about it. Please give it a shot and give us any feedback (good

**PREVIEW**

Well

Only thing is, but I'm fairly certain Paul Pierce hasn't pre-ordered his OKC Beat the Heat t-shirt. Nope, he's packed for a week. He's not expecting to be back in Boston for a little while now. And it's exactly this attitude that makes me believe tonight. Everything is now against this team. A few days ago, everyone was on the Celtics bandwagon. Fast forward to Game 6 and now everyone is off it again. We are expected to lose. We are expected to be too old. We are expected to bow out to the might of LeBron.

Except this team won't go quietly. Paul Pierce hasn't had that huge game we know he's capable of. I feel that this game could happen tonight. He's had every run of bad shooting luck so far this series

Here's some facts you might like:

[Of the last five teams to win by 19 pts facing elimination (the #Heat in Game 6) and not in winner-take-all game

[The ‪#Heat‬ are one of two teams (the ‪#Celtics‬ are the other) to lose more than one Game 7 at home since 2000.](https://twitter.com/SherrodbCSN/status/211590567581319168)

[This is the 14th NBA Game 7 in the last five years. The Celtics have been in half of them. That after going 16 years only playing in one.](https://twitter.com/SeanGrandePBP/status/211580455030501377)

[LeBron James teams are now 3-6 facing elimination. But he’s averaged 31.4 points (best in NBA history)

Teams are expected to go in unchanged.

**Good:**

* Rondo is posting his best true shooting percentage ever

* KG is still KG.

* Our defense is slowly looking better

* Sullinger looks like a real keeper. If he develops

**Bad:**

* I messed around basketball reference with Pierce's stats. He is posting near career lows as far as PER, and it worries me that his age is catching up to him to the point where he can't bring it every night. Hopefully this is just a slump.

* Courtney Lee has been a let down.

* Brandon Bass has also been a let down.

**Outlook:**

**Preview**

Well

We're at home

We all know by now that Bradley is done for the season and won't be making a remarkable game 7 comeback. Dooling is apparently right to play also

Sean Grande has some interesting stats about tonight:

* The Celtics are 18-2 in their last 20 at the Garden. Both losses by a single point.
* The Celtics are 17-4 in home Game 7’s but lost the last one
* The New Big Three are 3-3 facing elimination
* 2011-12 Celtics when Avery Bradley played 10+ minutes : 40-19. 2011-12 Celtics when Avery Bradley played 0-9 minutes: 6-13

Interesting stuff. I'd love nothing more than MP having a huge game and raining threes on the Sixers! In the end

The Celtics find themselves at a crossroads this summer. Take the blue pill and they see whether Rajon Rondo's return from a torn ACL might be enough to breathe life into a roster that finished 41-40 and lost in the opening round of the playoffs. Take the red pill and they consider the harsh reality of rebuilding by trading veterans Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce.

Since the last two remaining members of Boston's original big three are so close

The Celtics will have another opportunity at a makeover next summer, Boston won't have significant cap space until Brandon Bass and the rapidly aging Jason Terry come off the books in the summer of 2015.

Given the age of their core and their limited flexibility

The starting five tonight will be Rondo, Bass and Garnett. Doc making two changes to the lineup from last night. It will be interesting to see how Terry goes in a starting role. He should get plenty of looks from Rondo, perhaps we might see a bit more three point shooting than last night?

A back-to-back game tonight. Never a great thing for the Celtics

**PREVIEW**

Game 2. Much like last game, then this series score might have been flipped around. The Celtics will have learned a lot from that loss and I expect them to come out differently in this game.

Ray Allen was spoken about being left out for this game

The refs were interesting, just a fair go. The Celtics also need to play harder, as has been discussed ad nauseam in the media for the past 48 hours. Wade and LeBron were able to drive to the basket far too easily, too many times. Expect a more physical game, especially from KG, Bass and Stiemsma (which means more fouls.....)

Lastly, KG just keep doing what he's doing and Allen needs to get a break. Personally, I'd like to see less scoring from Rondo and more passing. He is the key to bringing guys like Allen and Pietrus into the game. They rely on looks and Rondo needs to give them this. Add in a little run and gun from Rondo to Bass and Hollins and we have some easy buckets.

Big game tonight

**Preview**

Game 1 and we're starting at home. Sounds good

The Celtics have come out of a tough series against Atlanta, play good D and have a real X-factor in Iguodala. The match up favours the Celtics, but they will still need to be at their best to get by Philadelphia. As I read somewhere this morning, it's a ""trap"" series.

Everyone will be playing tonight. The Sixers don't have any injuries to speak of and the Celtics are still carrying the injuries we all know of. Allen was the least likely to play

It was the last time we faced the Sixers that Pietrus crashed to the floor and had to be stretchered off. Let's hope he has something to prove tonight. Rondo just finished 8th in the MVP voting

Let's take a comfortable win and stay healthy

**PREVIEW**

I don't think it's right to call a game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals a trap game, which is what worries me. Miami are playing for their lives and that counts for something. Thankfully, we have a couple of guys out there used to playing for their lives. Experience counts and I trust the big 3 and our main man, Rondo, to get the job done. There can be no taking this game for granted though.

The teams should go in unchanged

I don't have anything else to say

&gt; You’ve probably forgotten all about them by now. Nothing left in the tank, too injury prone, too much mileage. Hmm…

&gt; You better hope you’re right, grit, toughness, leadership, moxie, savvy, passion, heart and these guys are at their best when the stakes get [BIG](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYwtOn75rc0).

**Preview**

In my opinion

Last game the Celtics attempted only 9 free throws

Pierce needs to get back to his healthy best if we are to win this series and I believe tonight will be telling. If he can play at 80% tonight and hit his shots

Let's do this Celtics.
