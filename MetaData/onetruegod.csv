Today is a momentous occasion for all of us, every single one of us may improve the whole world. 

Whether it be through contributing to those in need, or simply enjoying the gift of boners, all of them assure us of one thing: that we are powerful. That we are blessed by the Cage, and made by His divine decree. That we may fight against evil and the Travolta, and one day vanquish him and his dark bees from this world.
