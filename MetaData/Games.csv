N4G discussion: [SimCity Modder Plays Offline

---------

Bullet points with recent modding discoveries:

* Players have reverse engineered modding. Significant parts of the game's code is in Javascript.

* The game can be played without an internet connection indefinitely after modding. Can only stay in one city.

* SimCity has behavior for offline save handling. When offline

* Debug tools were left open

* ""Big maps"" are referenced multiple times in the game's code. Possible DLC regions with big city plots? It's the only way they can increase the city size without breaking existing maps.

* Internal terraforming tools were discovered

* Population numbers are faked / inflated - *GetFudgedPopulation*. [chart](http://i.imgur.com/AhIm3Gu.png) - thanks fat_ugly_midget.

* After modding

* Latest patch has made package files read only

-------

A reverse-engineered [modding guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a8bw7/how_to_mod_sim_city_2013_getting_started_basics) was posted on /r/simcity earlier today by /u/Plornt. Locked terraforming tools^1 were discovered too.

Thanks to the power of the internet, and even being able to play the game **without a connection** to EA's servers. In the unmodded game, you will get kicked out after 20 minutes, but now it can be trivially patched to indefinitely. Server features like region play, and save/load handling are obviously not available.

Looking at the JS code posted on GitHub (not linked here since possible copyright infringement)

This is indicative that offline support was hastily removed late during the development cycle. Possible EA/Maxis debate/internal conflicts?

^1: Only developer builds could actually make use of terraforming

^2: The population displayed on the user interface becomes inflated after the first 500 sims. This is intentional and not a bug

**TL;DR:** SimCity kicks you out after 20 minutes of being disconnected from EA servers

**ESEA Statement has been released! Full post at the bottom of this post or [click here to read on esea.net](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=news&amp;d=comments&amp;id=12692)**

ESEA Member unisolsz discovered that the client required to play on ESEA was running a [bitcoin miner](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining). After players were complaining about virus alerts being set off from the client and unusually high GPU usage and BSOD errors.

[The thread he made regarding this can be found here](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=492102)

ESEA admin

He later corrects that it was running for 2+ weeks and actually raised 29~ bitcoins (around $3

Bitcoin miners use up 100% of GPU processes and lead to a lowered hardware lifespan

Link to /r/GlobalOffensive discussion: http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1dgad2/esea_client_basically_a_virus/

**UPDATE:** Someone has pointed out that the bitcoin address that lpkane posted [a picture of in his first post](http://www.picsend.net/images/923377coin.jpg) is different compared to the [address he lists in his second post.](http://i.imgur.com/BuPbk5b.png) Very strange...

**UPDATE #2:** I should clarify that no one that was affected lost any money of their own. It was a poor choice of words for me to say that he 'stole' the money. I was referring to the fact that people that were affected most likely saw an increase in electricity usage

**UPDATE #3:** I was contacted by /u/GGTY886 that informed me that he had posted a thread regarding the mining two hours before unisolsz had posted his that was locked by an admin. [Located here](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=492064)

There is also a thread located [here](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=491845) by a user that discusses the symptoms of the miner.

He also sent me a recording of a conversation with an ESEA admin discussing the issue which can be listened to here: [The Recording](http://www.twitch.tv/ggty886/b/397871712)

His PM in full in case you're interested:

**UPDATE #8:** Craig Levine ""Torbull"" (owner of ESEA) has posted this statement on the forums regarding the situation:

&gt;The first I learned about any of this was last night (on any scale). I had no idea any of this was going on.

&gt;Needless to say I am completely embarrassed

&gt;For the past ten years

&gt;I'm wrapping my mind around this whole thing and we'll release a formal response

&gt;I'm committed to doing whatever possible to rebuild the trust we lost through this whole fiasco.

[Source Post #608](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=492152)

Some more information from Craig:

**Post #632**: 
&gt;It's a failure on my part to have the proper oversight to have prevented this from happening and it will be addressed.

&gt;My primary concern at this point is community trust and how that was destroyed. We need to understand the situation, and address anyone who incurred physical damages.

&gt;How we rebuild the trust of the community in the immediate aftermath and long term future is going to be a different discussion that we need to have as I walk through this all.

**Post #710**:
&gt; **Standby for a more formal response with information about the situation and recourse for those impacted.**

**Post #742**:
&gt;the facts of the situation are beyond what has been shared to this point.

&gt;We're going to do everything in our power to address the issue of what happened, but this is obviously something we take incredibly serious.

**Post #802**:
&gt;**the money will be going somewhere much more righteous than the prize purse in addition to the prize purse**

**Post #810**:
&gt;why would we risk our business and livelihood on making some inconsequential amount of money on Bitcoins

&gt;I assure you that I and the larger ESEA entity had no knowledge of this. We're working to figure out what happened to respond accordingly.

**Post #829**:
&gt;His ([lpkane's](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=488095&amp;find_comment_number=23#n23)) response there was done more playfully than seriously. We would never knowingly allow this to be done to our community and I'm looking into all of the details for how this happened.

**Post #886**:
&gt;**We will be setting up a mechanism to address anyone who's computer parts were damaged through this process**


**UPDATE #9:** /u/PrincessChoadzilla has posted a analysis of the three bitcoin addresses ESEA admins used to collect the bitcoins [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1dglil/popular_competitive_gaming_league_esea_admins/c9qfc56) and found that there has been 1 bitcoin that is still not accounted for by lpkane.

**IMPORTANT UPDATE:** [ESEA Statement has been released](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=news&amp;d=comments&amp;id=12692):

&gt;Throughout the history of gaming and e-sports, event organizers, and even “sponsors.” Over the past ten years ESEA has prided itself on being an upstanding member of the gaming community by providing a high quality service, paying out prize money, and being upfront and transparent with you, the community. We worked hard to build your trust and often took the longer, slower

&gt;ESEA’s goal is to provide our community with cutting edge technology and tools. Whenever possible, consenting administrators’ accounts to see how the mining process worked and determine whether it was a feature that we might want to add in the future. We thought this might be an exciting new tool that we could provide to our community. Ultimately, we decided that it was not.

&gt;On April 13, ESEA informed those involved in the test that we were killing the project and they should stop using the beta test. It came to our attention last night, however, that an employee who was involved in the test has been using the test code for his own personal gain since April 13, 2013. What transpired the past two weeks is a case of an employee acting on his own and without authorization to access our community through our company’s resources. We are extremely disappointed and concerned by the unauthorized actions of this unauthorized individual. As of this morning, ESEA has made sure that all Bitcoin mining has stopped. ESEA is also in the process of taking all necessary steps internally to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again.

&gt;The owners and management at ESEA all apologize to each of you that were impacted by the recent events and intend to make things right.

They don't want you going through Steam support to get a refund, you are no longer entitled to a refund, while they laugh all the way to the bank. That's called fraud by the way"". Well said.

**UPD 19:24 15.09.2012 (UTC):** I never thought I'd have to post that, not a country as a whole, and preferably using the Report button and not Reddit for that. I'm not writing this update because I'm Russian, I'm writing this because what you're doing is just outright wrong and you have no right to judge a whole country by a nonrepresentative selection of people you play DotA with. I would have stood up for any country, but trust me, there's more to Russia than DotA kids. So please, if you have nothing to contribute to the discussion except hate and this special form of internet racism

So, so I just went for it. When the game showed up in my library, it was named 'Borderlands 2 RU'. That was suspicious, but I decided to wait and see. Today I learned that I got a [completely different version](http://cdr.thebronasium.com/app/217490). What's the difference?

The biggest one is *the AppID*. Basically, we likely *won't be able to get DLC* either. The *people who preordered the Season Pass* are now *unable to activate it*, because it's meant for a different AppID.

Secondly, you can't play any more. This also seems to not be the case with the retail (boxed) version.

Then

Also, from 'шизофрения' - schizophrenia and 'стрелять' - shoot. The most adequate translation I can come up with is 'Schizo shooter'. This is *a whole new level of shitty translations*. And now the Steam pages say that the game will only be playable in Russian.

But wait, Estonia, and some other countries* are getting the exact same version. Yeah, the Russian one. The likely *Russian only* one. There are more people who speak English than those who speak Russian in Lithuania. And yet, they're *forced to get the Russian version*. They paid full price. $60, €50, whatever. They didn't even pay less. And now they get a cut version.

Oh

Why am I posting this to reddit? Because it's not only about Borderlands 2. *Removing languages, language locked* and it has *subscriptions*. Yes, you read that right. Only in Russia. *Battlefield 3* is language locked.

Blah blah blah piracy blah blah. I don't care. I paid for the game. I would have paid $60 for the game if that was the price. And now I want to be *treated like a customer*

So here's where you come in

If you guys think this is a good idea

**1. Ask questions and interview people based on reddit requests.**

**2. Provide extremely fast response times.**

I'll do my best to upload video interviews as fast as I can. I'll knock out an interview

**3. Give you the highest quality footage I can.**

**Sultan Tarquin account got unlocked

* **Update #5 Valve Employee Response**

**/u/smeehrrr (Valve Employee)**
&gt;**Valve employee here. This was a human error on the part of the support agent moving the funds to the correct account. It is not indicative of an exploit. The account in question has been unlocked and we’re going to look at improving our tooling to prevent similar errors in the future.**

**/u/MonkfishEsq (Sultan Tarquin
&gt;**Valve actually came through and un-screwed my account. Well there's a turn up for the books.**

Summary of /u/jtraub post on http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1heuz7/warning_russian_users_can_use_an_exploit_to_shut/catnn2x

&gt;An evil guy can send a small amount of money (1-10 roubles) **via QIWI payment system to a person he wants to spite**. All he needs to know to deposit funds is an **account name (login). 1 rouble deposit is a really small amount of money which will be almost not noticeable** if you do not read emails from steam. **After that an evil guy fills a chargeback request with QIWI

From /u/jtraub 
&gt;It seems, Valve recieves chargeback request and automatically locks your account.** It seems, that policies do not allow support to manually unlock your account.

**From /u/MonkfishEsq (Sultan Tarquin the guy from image post)**
&gt;Yo. Tarquin here. I just figured I'd stop by here to set a few **facts** straight:

&gt;-**My steam login and steam username are different** 

&gt;-**I never gave out my steam login name to anyone** 

&gt;-**I never spent the money that went into my account**

&gt;-**Steam automatically converted the rubles into my currency (GBP. It was 20 pence)**

&gt;Blame me for trolling or whatever. But do you really think telling people using global chat like skype to ""sshhh"" warrants me getting my account transaction banned for 9 weeks?

&gt;Yeah.

From /u/HereForGames (OP on /r/steam)

&gt;http://i.imgur.com/18K9bHV.png Can you add this to the OP of your post? Some people are claiming the guy was trying to sneakily spend the 10 rubles ($0.03) added to his account to make Steam look good

&gt;**In that image he's seen contacting Steam support about the rubles on the 27th

* **Summary of /u/jtraub post on http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1heuz7/warning_russian_users_can_use_an_exploit_to_shut/catnn2x**

* **Ideas that could fix this issue**

/u/name_was_taken
&gt;**Since only Russian accounts can send money

&gt;That

/u/konaitor
&gt;**Or have some form of verification on submitting funds.** (like an accept funds notification

/u/TheJosh
&gt;Here is your confirmation PIN: 1221

&gt;**Steam notification: You have received funds

&gt;**They do it for emails

* **Advice from /r/steam**

/u/Thankarat
&gt;**Don't disclose your account name (login) in the first place.**

/u/jtraub
&gt;If you want your account to be safe from things like this one you should use profile name (nickname) wich differs from your account name. **You should not tell your account name to anyone who is not with steam support.** You should use graphic editor to remove account name from screenshots of your steam/browser (when you are logged in) you post online.

&gt;Do not disclose your acccount name (login) to anyone who is not with steam support. This is really vital measure

* **NOT Advice**

From me : I just wanted to say sorry if this topic make russian steam users look bad or make them to learn and abuse this exploit. I didnt mean to do that

it doesn't change the singleplayer experience.

and that the cod games have a fun multiplayer doesn't make the singleplayer any better.

something i often read or hear is ""limited replay value"" and they make a big deal out of it.

does a book need replay value
it's either awesome or it's not.
do people rate a live concert for it's replay value ?

1354502295.0,146hpa,Monopoly released 3 days ago on steam. It has no LAN or online multiplayer. What is even the point of making Monopoly without online multiplayer in this day and age?,Red_Inferno,3820,1735,472,"It is a single computer multiplayer game. I had a copy of monopoly over 10 years ago that I got for free from a cereal box that was the same thing. The only difference between that and this would be the graphics.

The reason a lot of people don't play monopoly is because you have to gather friends/family and get them to play for 1-3hrs+ and even then you might not even be able to finish if someone decides to quit. 

I was considering buying it and I had friends considering buying it too since monopoly can actually be pretty fun if you have people who will actually play. When I told them it was single computer they all instantly lost interest.

If you were thinking of buying it I WOULD NOT PAY A PENNY FOR IT. Hell I would not even pirate it. I don't even understand why it even got released on steam since I see 9/10 people who bought it wanting a refund.

edit:
Ya so far most everyone who has bought it is [complaining about the lack of online multiplayer](http://steamcommunity.com/app/221300/discussions).

I'm a lawyer. For those who don't know, you're already 4 hours late.  Most young attorneys I know don't have hobbies at all, apart from the occasional round of golf or fantasy football league. I'm the only one I know that I'd consider a ""hardcore"" gamer. I'm certainly the only person with a Steam library and 350 hours in Skyrim.

Growing up

Yesterday, and very high-pressure. My job was to operate the powerpoint presentation i made and basically not say anything. There was some chit-chat about the technology, and one of the guys in the room - a surgeon in his 60s - made a comment that he was a **'master gamer'**. I got the sense that was the kind of thing he probably didn't get to talk about in depth with people often, **so I said ""Surgery Simulator 2013?"" He says ""Black Ops II, 3rd Prestige."" I give him a O_o look and the presentation begins.** I don't say anything else.

**EDIT:** the emoticon i used there was meant to be surprise. if you were in the situation

After the presentation, since you're essentially using a gamepad/joystick. Then he got hooked and he's a total console junkie, spent a ton of money on a home theater system and a 60'' plasma to play games, and he's a 3rd-level prestige in blops2. I don't play COD (also i'm a PC gamer mostly) but he gave me his gamertag and wants to play. 

So, and the client explained to my boss why it's fun / cathartic / relaxing to play games where you shoot people. His gamertag is hilarious, but obviously I can't post it here.

The guy ended the meeting by saying that he actually wanted to get home because he had pre-ordered Dead Space 3. In the car

Just a very unexpected

**EDIT:** Since this made the front page, understand that in my world, the baby boomer generation is still the overwhelming majority. Most conversation centers around golf, football, and baseball. It's rare that you have an in-depth conversation about tech (although this is happening more often) or gaming (other than mobile games), so this was a pleasant surprise. And by ""adult"" I was referring only to my age, not my personality.

Also: not that playing Black Ops is a bad thing. I stopped playing COD games because I didn't have time to keep up with everyone else. As free time became rare,False,,t5_2qhwp,1360323870.0,,,t3_183xqu

Fans have been recording their playthroughs with commentary for years now, and here is where our story takes a turn.

Videos of Shining Force games have seemingly been targeted recently

The video selection seems to be random, and some with the fan translation. People with commentary and without commentary have been hit equally. Let's Players who've used an HDPVR have been flagged just as much as people playing via emulation. The videos themselves are being flagged in various parts of the games, not specific scenes or screens. Many of the producers don't even have their channel set up for monetization, let alone these specific episodes.

Popular YouTube game critic TotalBiscuit has even had his videos flagged, he isn't able to upload unlisted videos to his primary channel as a result of it.

1353949272.0,13ti3e,Mowing the Astroturf,Deimorz,2994,1049,263,"Over the weekend, and why it's not allowed on reddit (it's actually one of the few things against [the site-wide rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules)).

**What is vote-manipulation

Let's demonstrate with a particularly egregious example. [Here is a screenshot of *some* of the comments that one user posted on Kickstarter over the weekend](http://i.imgur.com/r94iu.png) (a regular user

* Specifically telling people to go upvote something you're associated with (especially if it's your own submission).
* Even worse
* Saying things like ""Please help defend"" and ""Keep an eye on the naysayers""

This is obviously an extreme example, unless they specifically want to point out something in the comments.

So for example, since they could have just linked the trailer directly. And of course, if they directly *ask* for upvotes there's really no question about it.

**Why is vote-manipulation bad?**

When people have their submission removed due to vote-manipulation

First of all, expressed through the voting system. But when a group of people do a drive-by on the votes for one particular submission, that's not really *the community* participating any more, just random people with reddit accounts. One of the greatest things about reddit is how easy it is to join and start participating immediately, but unfortunately this also makes it just as easy for people to join for the sole purpose of abusing the system.

Another major factor is how the ranking system on reddit works. Submissions are ranked on a combination of two factors: their score (upvotes - downvotes), the first 10 points are worth exactly the same as the next 90, and then the next 900 after that. So the first few votes on a submission are the most important by far. Also, each order of magnitude in score is equal to a 12.5 hour difference in submission time. So a post with 100 points will have exactly the same ranking as one with 10 points submitted 12.5 hours later.

Combined, Facebook, etc., someone can cause that submission to shoot up the ranks much faster than would normally be possible. So not only do you have people not involved in the community influencing the ranking, but their influence will be especially powerful.

**If you notice it

Hopefully now it's fairly clear why vote-manipulation is an important issue. The combination of reddit's almost-nonexistent barrier to entry along with the ranking system makes it quite straightforward for outside forces to try to influence post rankings

Please look out for anything that appears to be vote manipulation

* Someone sending out links to reddit submissions
* A submission that appears to be getting voted up at an unusually high rate right after submission
* A submission where the comments are quickly flooded with new users making suspiciously supportive comments like ""Looks great!"", etc. (and these comments being upvoted quickly).

If you notice anything like this, since these are often deleted.",[/r/all],False,,t5_2qhwp,1354029213.0,,moderator

As of right now, and we often even get a few modmails telling us that the subreddit is going to hell and that we need to start heavily moderating comments, banning people, etc. This flair is meant to try and head this off a bit by explaining *why* the comments in that particular post are full of reaction gifs and such.

The comments in a post that gets near the top of /r/all shouldn't be used to make any judgments about the state of /r/Games, and they often don't even realize that this is a different subreddit from /r/gaming. [One of the top posts here a couple of weeks ago was largely people complaining about /r/gaming, apparently without even realizing that they were actually in a different subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/101swp/can_we_stop_with_the_im_about_to_start_playing_x/c69t485?context=1).

If there was a way to opt out from /r/all, and is quite consistently in the top 10 non-defaults by number of users online and number of new subscribers](http://stattit.com/r/Games/). Despite that, it's still not common at all for our submissions to reach the top 100 of /r/all. Since I first implemented this flair about a week ago, only 3 posts have received it (and the SimCity one very barely made it). That's far less than 1% of our overall submissions, so I think it's a valuable notification for the rare cases where it does happen.

It is still a bit of an experiment though

I was talking to my friends last night about how much they missed City of Heroes when I had this epiphany. I'm really afraid of being the one guy in the group who has no experience -- the one who has to be told what to do and what to expect. I feel like, they're going to get angry or frustrated with me. I want everybody to have fun, and I don't want to feel guilty for getting in the way of that. It feels especially inconsiderate in games like WoW or SC2 where a raid or match can last over half and hour. Why should I waste so much of multiple people's time?

Rationally

I just can't shake that fear. I honestly don't think it's about ego; I don't really care if anonymous people don't like me. Maybe it has to do with my general dislike of negative environments in real life. In real life

Does anybody else feel this way? I want to play in PUGs, but this is getting in my way. Should I not worry about other people's fun as much? Is this problem common? How do you guys deal with it, if you think about it at all?

We've currently got it set to hide the score of comments for 60 minutes after they're posted. The idea is that this should help reduce ""bandwagon"" voting behavior. Someone will often make a completely reasonable comment about a game that's unpopular (Mass Effect 3, etc.), and it will immediately receive a few downvotes from people based on their dislike of the game in question. After that, it's often common for the comment's score to continue dropping, which is probably at least partially due to people seeing that the comment's already been downvoted and just continuing the trend.

In a way

Let us know if you have any feedback about this change specifically

If a character had a life span in game

1. Risk vs Reward - If a character lost 1% of their toon's existence for every death for example

2. Casual vs hardcore gamer - This concept works for both. It would be entirely possible for the casual gamer to be one of the most powerful on their server. The Hardcore gamer may reach higher skills quicker
3. End game vs dynamic game play - The developers can focus more on world alteration, thriving settlements are now ghost towns, roads over grown. No two lives would be the same.
4. Guilds/Clans - Would rise and fall organically. A strong guild could lose their leadership to death or a master smith to death. A guild has always been the sum of their members
5. True need for class/path diversity - With loss of characters, scouts, politics,.... With death a crafters has a real need to apprentice replacements, a healer is needed to prolong life. Imagine being the only Grandmaster weaponsmith in your area instead of everyone being one after 1 month? ""Yeah, we had a weaponmsmith who could make that, but he died last week. Try the town down south
6. True accomplishment - How much discovery, a player's life takes on true meaning. Ever play on a new server and get excited about being the first to accomplish anything? I have and it is truly a great feeling, never to be felt again after a month. What if you could set new individual or guild records continually?
7. Solo vs group play - This is similar to casual vs hardcore. Regardless of your playstyle the risk will match the reward
8. No useless zones - How many times do we see a starting zone packed for a month or two only to become a bunch of quest giving NPCs with no one to talk to? There would not be a need for ""new players"" to keep areas thriving, it is quite possible the world he remembered the first time through is completely altered, always offering ""fresh content."" Even a progressed player would enjoy revisiting where he started helping mentor a friend new to the game.
9. Community - Would receive a huge boost. Imagine a vet asking a newbie where something is or for help progressing because the world he knew was gone? Crafting would mean something even at a very low level because of a new need for gear. This would bridge the vets to the newcomers. Add to the fact the world is dangerous again

So there are my reasons why toons need a lifespan to take MMOs to the next level. I think an MMO would have a good chance at a healthy population of gamers for more than a 6 month run. A game that would challnge and entertain for years.

So what would be the draw backs to this?

See any other benefits?

Disclaimer: I used to be an Xbox 360 fanboy

**GPU Raw Power**

So this is pretty simple -- the PS4 has 50% more GCN units than the Xbox One. In layman's terms

So how do these actually compare? Anandtech has a great benchmark tool that lets us see just that - on identical systems

For those that don't want to click the link

* Xbox One GPU: 31.7 fps
* PS4 GPU: 49 fps

*PS4 performed 54.5% better than the Xbox.*

EDIT: Some comments are saying the 7790 vs 7870 isn't a decent match up because of the memory bus doubling in the 7870

If you want to see potentially comparable cards in the GTX line, and you're back to around a 43% increase on Far Cry 3.

Edit 2: [A great visual comparison between similar cards](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1hawc4/the_power_difference_between_the_ps4_xbox_one/caskv6k)

So this performance increase is pretty significant

**CPU performance**

This should be near identical. Both are using 8-core AMD APUs that seem clocked at the same speeds. In fact, and we won't see funky things like the challenges the PS3 cell processor raised that resulted in worse ports of games.

**RAM Speed**

So here things get a bit more complicated

The AMD APU puts both the CPU and GPU on the same chip. Now, where the shared memory pool allows the CPU and GPU to exchange memory addresses. Previously, while both the CPU and GPU used the same memory pools, if data wanted to be shared between the two, the data had to be copied from the GPU's area in RAM to the CPU's area in RAM. Now they can just tell each other where in RAM things are located, by passing memory addresses to each other. We'll talk more about this later. (If you can't wait, [read this article on ArsTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/amds-heterogeneous-uniform-memory-access-coming-this-year-in-kaveri/) for how awesome this is)

So ok

Well

The Xbox One went with 8GB DDR3 and 32 MB of eSRAM for a throughput of ?? GB/s. Well -- we don't actually really know how fast it will be

How and why does this matter? We know from past benchmarks that RAM speed really matters for the performance of APUs in games.

In [these benchmarks](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/memory-bandwidth-scaling-trinity, we can see that when not bottlenecked by the GPU computation, an increase in memory throughput of 11.2% resulted in gains of 27.5% for frames per second (using the AvP numbers without any effects -- keep in mind the built in GPU on this APU was pretty crappy, so other numbers are going to be compute limited).

I don't know how hUMA will change these results

**RAM Latency**

So there's this common response to the DDR3 vs GDDR5 memory that says ""but GDDR5 has higher latency than DDR3."" I'm not sure where this myth comes from

* Here's the published latency speeds for GDDR5 from hynix: [PDF](http://www.hynix.com/datasheet/pdf/d...FP(Rev0.1\).pdf) (page 48):
* And for DDR3: [PDF](http://www.hynix.com/datasheet/pdf/graphics/H5GQ1H24AFR(Rev1.0\).pdf) (page 113)

For those that don't care to read the above: the timings are better for GDDR5 than for DDR3.

Clock speed still needs to be known for calculating the latency

Xbox One DDR3 clock speed: 2133MHz

PS4 doesn't have a listed clock speed AFAIK, the clock speed would need to be around 2750 MHz to support 11 GB/s (at 4GB/s per GHz). We then double that because it's DDR and we get 5500MHz. (thanks /u/luggles !!)

So by all measures

**Unified Memory Bonuses**

So remember earlier when we were talking about hUMA and unified memory? Well, had an [AMAZING interview with Gamasutra back in April](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/191007/inside_the_playstation_4_with_mark_.php).

In it

&gt; ""One thing we could have done is drop it down to 128-bit bus,"" said Cerny. While that solution initially looked appealing to the team due to its ease of manufacturability, it was abandoned thanks to the complexity it would add for developers. ""We did not want to create some kind of puzzle that the development community would have to solve in order to create their games. And so we stayed true to the philosophy of unified memory.""

So what are the neat things the PS4 can do that may be harder on the Xbox One due to the complexity of the memory subsystem? *GPU compute.*

&gt; Cerny envisions ""a dozen programs running simultaneously on that GPU"" -- using it to ""perform physics computations

That extra 50% of GPU power won't just be for rendering frames - if the GPU is operating at only 80% to render a frame, as it reduces bottlenecks from the CPU in things like AI or physics. And this depends very much on hUMA to do this successfully.

We have yet to hear detailed tech reports from Microsoft on the hUMA potential. The most recent info was about the eSRAM throughput, or if the speed of the throughput is at the cost of the flexibility of hUMA. Regardless, even if they do have no issues in hUMA, the worse GPU means there will be a lot less of the GPU left over to take on compute tasks.

Ultimately, but it sounds easy enough to manage that it shouldn't be difficult to get at least some performance increases in traditionally non-GPU tasks from the system.

**System Availability**

So the Xbox runs 2 operating systems and a hypervisor to switch between them

* The Xbox One has 5GB of RAM available for the games ([Source](http://gimmegimmegames.com/2013/05/microsoft-confirms-xbox-one-os-uses-3gb-ram-5gb-ram-for-games/))
* The Xbox One has up to 2 cores of the cpu (25%) and 10% of the GPU reserved for the system ([Source](http://kotaku.com/the-five-possible-states-of-xbox-one-games-are-strangel-509597078))
* The PS4 has 7GB available for games ([Source](http://www.psu.com/a019055/))
* I haven't found any data for how much of the CPU/GPU is reserved for the system on PS4

So the whole ""switching"" OS aspect of the Xbox takes a pretty big bite out of the already inferior system resources.

**TL;DR**

The difference between these two systems is massive. If you only read one section

On every single issue, and the Xbox One is an additional 25% of the PS4's price.

Please understand that the difference between these two systems is MUCH bigger than Xbox 360 vs PS3. The closest system difference I could track down was the difference between the GameCube and PS2 -- you can see [here](http://www.gameswelike.com/web/re/RE%20Comp.htm) how that actually ended up looking for a cross-platform port (Resident Evil). I'm not sure if the differences will be greater now (nearly identical hardware may result in better tuning)

###**Official Features**

***

Note: No specifications have been officially finalized but everything below has been officially announced.

* The PS4 allows people to resume games instantly upon turning on the system (no startup time) from where they were when they turned the system off. ([Source](http://www.psu.com/a018423/PS4s-Suspend-Mode-detailed-pick-up-games-right-where-you-left-off))

* All PS4 games (that aren't camera-based) should be playable remotely on Day 1 via Remote Play on the PS Vita. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/18ys2w/sony_exec_ps4vita_remote_play_will_work_day_one/))

* The PS4 will allow users to play games after downloading only a small portion of the game's data. ([Source](http://www.joystiq.com/2013/02/20/ps4-allows-playing-games-as-theyre-downloading/))

* Gamers can charge the DualShock 4 controller while PS4 is on standby. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/197exn/you_can_charge_the_dualshock_4_controller_while/))

* Share button functionality allows for quick screenshots or video upload of gameplay as well as sharing live streams of gameplay with friends or over USTREAM. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/19326z/people_seem_confused_about_how_the_share_button/))

* Users will be able take remote control of friends games to help them through tough spots and such.  ([Source](http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/20/playstation-4-game-streaming/))

* The system will launch with a headset that plugs directly into the controller for more prevalent voice communication across the PSN. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/18yddw/new_ps4_console_will_come_with_bundle_including_a/))

* Cross-game chat is officially supported. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/196eq4/crossgame_chat_officially_confirmed/))

* The PS4 will **not** block used games.  Though publishers are free to do as they wish. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/190uv8/sony_blocking_used_games_on_the_ps4_is_a/))

* Game prices will range from $0.99-$59.99. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/191515/ps4_titles_will_be_99_cents_to_60/))

* All PS4 games will be available as digital downloads. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/191dec/all_ps4_games_will_be_available_as_digital/))

* The PS4 will support Move but not the DualShock 3. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/192wc9/the_ps4_supports_move_but_not_ps3_controllers/))

* A PlayStation app called 'PlayStation App' is coming to Android and iOS that allows the device to act as a second screen (a la SmartGlass) as well as purchase content and have it directly downloaded to your system. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/18ycb1/sonys_playstation_app_for_ios_and_android_adds/))  It stands to reason that this will also include messaging on the go and other stuff like that.

* The PS4 will support 4K video output but not for games. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/18yvmy/playstation_4_wont_support_4k_games_3d_not_a_focus/))

* The PS4 is 3D capable but it is not a focus. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/18yvmy/playstation_4_wont_support_4k_games_3d_not_a_focus/))

* Certain apps can run in the background of games (such as the web browser) so you can access them without having to leave the game itself.  ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/196k7x/the_ps4_allows_for_background_apps_much_like_the/))

**Unsupported**

* **The PS4 is not natively backwards compatible** and thus cannot play PS3 games by default.  However

* The PS4 will not support the DualShock 3. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/192wc9/the_ps4_supports_move_but_not_ps3_controllers/))

**Missing Stuff So Far**

* The System Itself - No biggie.  My guess it will be a black box with stuff in it.

* System Pricing - including if there will be tiered models or a PS Vita bundle.

* Hard Drive Size/Upgradability - What size HDDs will launch with the system and will they be easily upgradable like the PS3?

* Pressure Sensitive Buttons - Are the controller buttons still pressure sensitive like the DualShock 3's were?

* YouTube &amp; Twitter - They were both strangely missing for the apps page in the OS preview and USTREAM seems to be the official gameplay stream site of choice for Sony.  This could mean Xbox is about to announce something big in conjunction with YouTube.  ([Source](http://www.ign.com/videos/2013/02/22/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-ps4-this-week))  Still, this shouldn't be a big deal.

1359332640.0,17ebak,EVE Online: How exactly a war can cost multiple thousands of REAL dollars. (LONG),jimmysaint13,2452,765,935,"Hello

I've been playing Eve on and off (but mostly on) since 2005. With all the hub-bub about the gigantic battle in Eve that recently took place

I'll be going over:

* Titans
* Other notable ship classes and values
* PLEX
* What started this huge battle

**--TITANS--**

First off

That is what's called a Kill Mail for a Titan that was destroyed in that battle. It shows who was piloting it, and who shot at it.

It took 954 pilots to bring it down. Those aren't units controlled on a board like in an RTS

This was the most valuable ship destroyed in that engagement, was worth 82.4 billion ISK. At current exchange rates, that works out to roughly $2,300 USD. (I'll explain more on the exchange rate later)

**So what makes Titans so valuable?**

The short version is that they take a massive amount of resources, and people fit really expensive equipment to them to try and ensure that they don't die.

First off, people can delay construction or outright destroy it while it is still building by attacking the Player-Owned Station (POS) that it is deployed under. These factors cover the ""difficulty"" part of why they're so expensive.

Second

Third, you have to build or buy the individual components, too. Having a major alliance with thousands of people helps out a lot with this.

Lastly

How rare? The sites at which they spawn are generated randomly and require specialized skills and equipment to track down. Once you find the site, it's a VERY low chance that the boss will drop the item. **THAT** rare.

**But why do you want a Titan?**

Well, that's what they're called. They're the single most powerful weapon in the game and inflict staggering damage, able to one-shot the lower classes of capital ship.

The second reason why you want a Titan is for their Jump Bridge. Basically

So yeah

**--OTHER NOTABLE SHIPS--**

There are 4 classes of Capital ship. From largest to smallest, Dreadnoughts and Carriers.

**Super Carriers** - Worth 20 to 25 bn ISK ($650 to $730). Not *quite* as hard to kill as a Titan, especially if a Burst gets centered on the Logistics (healer) group. Remote ECM Burst and their capital-killing Bomber Drones are why you want Supercarriers.

**Dreadnoughts** - Worth 3 to 5 bn ISK ($100 to $150). Damage output, but they can't move while Siege Mode is active and they cannot be targeted by friendly forces to receive repairs and power. The catch is that a ""cycle"" of Siege Mode lasts 10 minutes and cannot be interrupted. If you go into Siege Mode, you're stuck until it's over.

**Carriers** - Worth around 2 bn ISK ($60). Logistics (healer) powerhouses of the game. These ships specialize in repairing shields and armor and supplying capacitor power (used to run your modules) to other ships. Carriers can enter Triage Mode which boosts repair rates and capacitor power generation, making it harder for enemies to break it's target locks. But, like the Dreadnought's Siege Mode, while Triage Mode is active the Carrier cannot move and cannot receive repairs or power from allied ships and Triage Mode cannot be de-activated early. Triage Mode's cycle time is 5 minutes.

**Battleships** - Worth around 300 million ISK ($8). Battleships make up the main damage group of any large fleet. They're relatively cheap and expendable

**Battlecruisers** - Worth around 70 million ISK ($0.80). If you want cheap, but you still see them very frequently on the battlefield due to their cost-effectiveness. Battlecruisers are one step down from Battleships in terms of size.

Below Battlecruisers you have Cruisers

**--PLEX

PLEX stands for Pilot's License EXtension. A player may purchase a PLEX with real money and receive a code in their email. When they get this code

PLEX effectively allow a player to pay for their game subscription with in-game currency.

Currently, but I've also seen it as high as 700 mil.

**--THE HUGE BATTLE--**

Most estimates I've seen gauge the damage done in that battle (total losses from both sides) at around 630 billion ISK. This comes out to about $17

Dreddit (the Reddit-formed Eve Corporation) and Goonswarm (originating from the Something Awful forums) are at the heart of it. In the Long-Long-Ago

Fast forward through a lot of wars and operations together and about 3 years.

Goonswarm now heads up the ClusterFuck Coalition (CFC) which is made up of Goonswarm

Dreddit is head of Test Alliance Please Ignore, but not a hell of a lot of sub capitals. TEST has assloads of sub capitals. It's a mutually beneficial relationship. One rule of fleet composition is that you NEVER, NEVER, EVER field capitals without adequate subcapital support. That's why the TEST-Pandemic relationship works.

**--CONTINUED IN COMMENTS--**",,t5_2qhwp,1359332943.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/17ebak/eve_online_how_exactly_a_war_can_cost_multiple/
1350234797.0,11gtdd,Could we start using the term 'Expansion Pack' again?,StezzerLolz,3679,1997,721,"There was a time, there was a time when

Those were the glory days, before EVE Online and WoW had driven every other MMO to extinction, when the term 'hardcore gamer' was still a tautology. Nowadays, though, things are different. Nowadays, the gaming landscape has changed, and, publishers have learned to nickel and dime us for every feature they can withhold. Gone are the days of expansion packs, deep in their heart, for far more than it's worth.

But, is it? It's not true, and it's not fair to the decent and excellent bits of DLC that *are* out there.

And so I'd like to ask a question of you, and I feel like this is a mistake. I think it's time we started to separate the two terms, and gave them separate meanings. Different in what way? To be completely honest, it all comes down to quantity.

Let me give you an example. Look at the Borderlands franchise. Whether or not you like the games, Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot, The Secret Armory of General Knoxx, and Claptrap's New Robot Revolution. Each of those was a huge, sprawling set of new content, involving, basically

On the other hand, that doesn't qualify for an expansion pack. It's simply not enough new content, it won't lead to *that* many extra hours of playtime. It's DLC, and that's all it is.

I know this may seem nonsensical to many of you. Many of you will probably be thinking to yourself, due to the simplicity in the age of digital distribution of creating and shipping new content, it's become impossible to tell whether any new set of content is merely a couple of new guns or a massive twenty hour campaign. And, frankly, I'd like to be able to tell which it is when someone mentions it, and whether I should be OK with spending $5, $10 or $20 on it.

Age of Mythology is a real time strategy game. It is based around the ideas of Age of Empires and it combines it with ancient mythology. It can teach you about ancient Greek

1357983928.0,16fjon,"I just had one of the best gaming experiences of my life, and I was role playing as Hitler the entire time.",GoldenJoel,3479,1817,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/16fjon/i_just_had_one_of_the_best_gaming_experiences_of/

I just had one of the best gaming experiences of my life on a Garry's Mod server.

A little information to explain:  On Garry's mod, or even become mayor of the entire town.  The server I was playing on was a WW2 Occupation themed server, and I just so happened to land the role of The Fuhrer, in charge of the entire Reich army.

How I got this position was merely luck.  Players have the opportunity to vote for positions they'd like to hold.  Each player can vote yes or no on that request.  It gets kind of cluster fucked at times, but it works in a weird way.  

So anyway

I have the SS Officer set things up, the speech was ready to give, and about  15-20 players (There are 50+ in the server at times) followed me out to the courtyard steps as I prepped my speech.

I opened up youtube in steam and mic spammed one of Hitler's speeches

I didn't hear the shot, I ordered for my troops to look for the assassin and I initialized a lockdown.  A lockdown is a state of gameplay where the streets are supposed to be cleared by civilians and resistance.  German troops basically institute a curfew and either arrest or shoot violators on sight.
This is where the real meat of the session began.  I began to give more and more orders from my office, a lot of kids come on the server as well.  You know the type, young 12-15 year olds shooting people at random and calling them faggots or whatever.  Thankfully, my SS Officer and Kommandant kept them in line.  I had a lot of requests and meetings as my short time as Fuhrer.  Some were to report suspicious activity, others were just requests for orders.  I eventually began to get overwhelmed and told them to report to the SS or Kommandant for orders.

I didn't stay Hitler however...

At one point, and he was a German-Speaking player ONLY.  That's right, we had a Fuhrer that could not speak a word of English in charge of the entire Reich on a ENGLISH server.  The SS Officer and I found this quite hilarious, and tried a number of ways to communicate with our new leader.  We started posting adverts and requests for other German speakers who could translate, but eventually decided that it was too difficult.  The Fuhrer left the Reichstag and started to walk about.  The SS Officer and me began asking random people on the streets if they could kill The Fuhrer.  Most thought we were trying to bait them, but when we explained the situation it led to laughter.

Eventually he was killed and I was placed back in power.  I continued my business as usual.  I tried to be as fair as possible, etc.) but things began to push against me.  I got snippets of information from my Gestapo agent of gathering forces at a bar down the street.  I sent my troops to investigate, and it eventually led to a series of skirmishes in the streets.  A number of battles occurred in the slums and at the bar across the street.

There was one famous skirmish inside a warehouse.  My SS Officer alerted me that the resistance had holed up inside the building, so I paid him well and kept him close.  He also acted as a spy for me, reporting from the battlefield of the opposition.  I began to trust him, allowing him inside meetings with the High Command.

The leader of this opposition, ""The Bastard"" (Not his actual name but close.  I don't wanna give anyone unwanted attention.)

The Bastard used shady and rule-breaking tactics to try and get at me.   Unfortunately, against my orders, executed him.  He spawned back in jail, and in good faith I had him released.  He was still in the Reichstag when this happened, and drew his gun the moment he was able.  This led to him being gunned down by 6 of my men, again...

After a while, to breach my inner circle.  He let the resistance in, and I holed myself up in my office with a small group of troops, my doctor, and a personal friend whom I had made on the server.  We three hid in the corner as my troops fought with the overwhelming opposition, but they eventually broke through and killed us all.

So ended my rule as Hitler.  I may go back to owning a Soviet Spy base disguised as a bar.

QUICK NOTE:

To those asking for the Server name or IP address, just go looking for it on the GMod server listing.  Sorry! ^^

As for why the experiment failed, or with stylesheets disabled is high enough that there were still a ton of downvotes being used anyway, so it didn't prevent much. We knew this was a possibility since it was only a CSS modification and not a true disabling of downvoting (which isn't possible), but the only real way to find out how significantly it would affect things was to test it.

I also personally found myself frustrated several times at being unable to downvote posts that contained incorrect information. For example, they were voted up extremely quickly. They had reached scores of about +25 before anyone responded correcting them, and if nobody was able to downvote, those incorrect posts would have had at least 25 points indefinitely. This is not really desirable, and a perfectly legitimate application of downvoting.

And even though the downvote is back, and helps keep the threads a little more on-topic. Here's a sample of the removed comments from the above-mentioned Diablo III thread: http://i.imgur.com/zG17ubh.png",[/r/all],False,,t5_2qhwp,1358622715.0,,moderator

1362916202.0,1a0qun,Flaw/Exploit in Steam's Workshop Discussion/Forums - Allowing mod authors access to 'edit post' and 'PERMANENT USER BAN' powers,byakko,2476,900,197,"NOTE: **AS OF THIS POST

Thank you everyone for helping us get Steam's immediate attention to the theft first and foremost! Now let's see if this flaw has also been dealt with.  
  

**TomB of Valve has posted this on my main Workshop thread:**  
&gt; Workshop authors can ban users from the discussion areas for their item only. However

&gt; I've also given SupernaturalKath a Steam Community ban and banned all their Workshop items.  
  

**Mod note:** Please **DO NOT POST HER PERSONAL INFO** This thread was never meant to start a witch-hunt of her. [Reddit Mods have already spoken on this issue are issuing bans](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1a0qun/flawexploit_in_steams_workshop_discussionforums/c8t5rg0)  

This all started with a Skyrim mod thief called [SupernaturalKath](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067483616/myworkshopfiles/?72850)(dealt with and banned from Steam Workshop and Community pages) being found out to have stolen *many* mods. This includes the popular Skyrim mod - [Footprints](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22745) originally made by **jownd7**  

**jownd7** contacted SupernaturalKath on the mod's Discussion page. He also posted a list of all the stolen mods SupernaturalKath has taken in the main Workshop Discussion Page - [Skyrim Workshop content theft](http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/discussions/-1/864961721852325280/)  

Additional information given by other users later

On her stolen Footprints mod Discussion page

[The Edited original post and her reply](http://snag.gy/DxGax.jpg) - 
Note the Edit by-line of 'SupernaturalKath' and how she replied just 2 minutes later after the post became 'favourable'. Note that the edited post does not match jon's writing style.  

Even more alarming

After I posted a comment on her stolen mod page

Furthermore

Cited reason by her as 'being a spy'  

What started as an investigation into mod theft has now clearly revealed a HUGE exploit/flaw in Steam's mod author powers

Please see here for more information about SupernaturalKath's mod-theft and evidence of her access to higher level mod powers:   
  

**Ongoing discussion about mod theft and correspondence with jonwd7 (locked

**New main investigation thread** - [Bethsoft Forums](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1448749-mod-stealing-copying-thread-2/) (includes ongoing tests to see where the exploit lies. More or less confirmed.)  

**Discussion thread of her mod theft started by jonwd7 on the** [general Steam Workshop forum

**Discussion thread about her and her abuse of mod powers on the** [Steam Skyrim Workshop Discussion forum]( http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/discussions/-1/846947320682556820/?appid=72850) started by me  



Please upvote this for visibility. This exploit has far worse potential then just allowing mod thieves to get away scot-free!  

This is being x-posted to other subreddits as well.

Edited for clarity. Do not be alarmed to see my Steam account listed as 'banned' on my Discussion thread. It's part of a test between Bethsoft forum users to determine the exploit/flaw.

**Edit2:** SupernaturalKath is apparently online as multiple people are saying they are currently being banned from Skyrim Workshop Discussion forums the moment they comment on her mod pages with links to this page.

Another user banned after linking this reddit page: http://i.imgur.com/tf7Kssu.jpg

**Edit3:** jonwd7 was approached for comment for this article on [BeefJack](http://beefjack.com/news/steam-workshop-user-found-editing-and-banning-users-amid-accusations-of-uploading-stolen-mods/)

Woah this seems to be getting big

Also I'm aware of the doxxed information being posted. Please, but I'm still against doxxing. The post aim was to a) get her off the Skyrim Workshop and b) make Valve react to fixing this ASAP. I've notified the moderators about the info, please do not repost it.g",[/r/all],False,,t5_2qhwp,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1a0qun/flawexploit_in_steams_workshop_discussionforums/

1359312938.0,17dohb,EVE Online: A compilation of the background/news/videos/screenshots from the giant battle last night,LG03,2479,940,770,"Where to begin...

**First of all on the background concerning the Honey Badger Coalition and Cluster Fuck Coalition while trying to avoid writing a novel.**

Back in the day when Dreddit was first starting out in EVE they stumbled upon the Goons during a mining operation when someone misread the map and ended up in the wrong end of the universe. Upon stumbling on Dreddit the Goons destroyed them in short order. However the Goons were impressed with Dreddit's balls and decided to extend the olive branch and help them build their space empire. Fast forward a few years and now Dreddit is at the head of TEST Alliance Please Ignore (alliances being collections of corporations) which is at center of the HBC (coalitions being collections of alliances).

For several years the CFC and HBC worked together towards shared goals. Generally these goals were simply taking space from lesser alliances and destroying their enemies but notably one of the more meta gamey things they accomplished was OTEC. OTEC is a cartel that controls an extremely limited resource in the game that is vital for construction of advanced modules and ships. As can be expected everyone participating in the cartel grew rich and bloated beyond reason. Prices and markets were and continue to be manipulated across the universe and holding TECH moons is the goal of any would be alliance.

This very same cartel, this lead to some stagnation. As demonstrated in the summer/fall of last year during the last joint campaign between the HBC and CFC the Southern Coalition was utterly destroyed and evicted from their home space. During the sovereignty transfer of this space relations between the CFC and HBC broke down as the CFC left before the job was finished, leaving the heavy lifting for the HBC. Words were said, many of them not so nice. 

**as pointed out by /u/webo** 

*The HBC asked the CFC to come bail them out after losing a huge fleet fight. It was arranged that the CFC would get some space (the W4 constellation in Delve, just sov taking. Then, HBC said ""we don't want you to have any space because we don't need your help"".*

*Why would the CFC stay? They aren't getting what they were promised

**Montolio's take on the same situation (/u/Kavok)**

*They wanted some systems for 'defense of the region' - we wanted to handle defense ourselves. We offered to give them NOL-M9 as a symbolic gesture and some resource moons as payment for help. They declined the moons but took NOL-M9. Relations soured further after the transfer and we were given NOL-M9 back when the CFC went back north and pulled out all strategic assistance.*

Since then relations have been strained with things escalating slowly. In order to reduce workloads some allies had standings reset so that they could shoot each other without consequence. There was in effect though a No Infrastructure Pact between all parties. The NIP prohibited any military action against infrastructure in the form of sovereignty, etc. The TECH cartel wheels would continue to roll.

In the last ~2 months a squad within the HBC known as Sperg has been attacking a member alliance of the CFC known as Fatal Ascension. Reasons for specifically targeting this alliance are somewhat contrived but actions against FA consisted of attacking their members as they generated income or trying to catch fleets off guard. Billions of ISK worth of ships were destroyed before things came to a head.

HBC diplomat in charge of relations between the CFC and the HBC

[Now we arrive at the battle that took place last night](http://i.imgur.com/MnhLmX4.png) . This battle was beyond the scope of what many were expecting. Super capitals are considered to be borderline infrastructure due to their immense force multiplication. As such this could render the terms of the NIP moot and result in full blown war. However The_Mittani (leader of the CFC) is somewhat notorious for being adverse to risk so it's possible that he may sue for peace and attempt to resume peaceful relations to preserve the TECH cartel. It is known though

**Events that directly lead to the fight last night and a summary**

[For the /r/eve thread that I'm pulling information from and summarizing here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/17ckbk/pl_hot_dropped_goons/)

Last night the Liandri was reinforcing a CFC cobalt moon located in low security space with a capital fleet (I'll expand on why this is important). In response Fleet Commander DaBigRedBoat was given the green light to bring in a capital fleet to dumpster Liandri and protect their moon. This is where the fun begins

Sirens and alarms started to go off across the game

The HBC was fully scrambled and had even enlisted the aid of mutual enemies to come shoot the CFC. The CFC could not hope to win a fight against 2500+ people

Unfortunately for the HBC this system was indeed low security. This means that the Titan's most powerful weapon could not be deployed (the Doomsday) and that interdiction bubbles could not be used. Bubbles would have secured almost twice what HBC ended up killing since they can prevent the escape of ships in a massive AoE. Instead the HBC had to use focused interdiction on individual capitals and hope the interdictors could survive the fight. In the end a handful of dictors were lost and some capitals escaped but many more were destroyed.

Final estimates peg damages at 650 billion done to the CFC and 67 billion to the HBC. (~$20

So the main reason I've been excited about this game is that it looks rather hard and the combat has a real feel of 'desperation"" to it (judging from the vids)

One of the bits of the demo has you clearing out a room so you're companions can move through safely. The room has 4 ""runners"" (stage one zombies that are irritable, has a mushroomy face, tears your neck out if you get close). 

After getting my face beat in by runners and my jugular torn out numerous times by the clicker I was starting to get a bit self-conscious about my gaming abilities. I decided to mix up my strategy and go for the clicker first since it was causing the most difficulty. 

 Now I had two shivs which I was able to ""craft"" earlier from scissors and cloth which enable you to stealth kill an enemy. It is very important to be quiet in this game. I started the area by taking out one of the runners with a shiv

I'm a few feet from the clicker when there's a squeal from my left as a runner spots me

I run into a side room and hide low behind a desk hoping to avoid detection but it doesn't quite work, BOOM there's a splash of orange its dead... NOPE.. i just shattered off its ""mushroom growth shit"", let loose my last bullet and it finally dies. 

I feel like I barely survived, I just barely survived (low health) and used all of my scant resources to do so. 

After this zone there was some more exploring and traversing through a ruined cityscape, all I did was press X). I managed to take down a good number of them until I had used my 3 shotgun shells and my bat broke, my throat was then swiftly torn out. 

All in all though I really liked how the game was presented. You need to think about your encounters, it certainly won't last so you need to really utilize the best way in which to use it. The game is gorgeous and the voice-acting is top notch, it really adds alot to the tense atmosphere. 

Sorry for the wall of text

It's one of the major flaws I've seen with existing tutorials. They get pretty confusing to a new player as they just get too deep into the concepts to be meaningful without having already learned a lot of the stuff they're discussing.

Over the last year, and are typically around the top 25 by number of users online and number of comments being posted. Considering most of the top 20 is made up of the default subscriptions, this makes us one of the very top non-default subreddits.

Overall, but nothing very major. And on that note, there's a couple of things in particular that I want to discuss today.

### Game recommendations and other rules

Fairly early on in the subreddit's life, what games are good?"" Beyond that, we mostly allow anything, as long as there's at least something to guide the discussion. So asking for recommendations similar to other games or in particular genres is fine. However, there are still quite a few low-quality recommendation requests being posted, and I know that some people aren't happy about them. I should mention that I don't think they're really a huge issue since they're generally downvoted and aren't dominating the subreddit or anything, but they do clutter up the /new page a bit.

So I'd like to suggest an addition to the rules about recommendation posts, so they naturally can't cause much of a discussion for others. Since we already ban other types of posts that are just looking for a specific answer (""Where can I buy Game X?"", etc.), I think this also fits in well with that.

Any thoughts on this, everything doesn't specifically need to be dealt with by moderation.

### An experiment in ""community moderation""

But on that topic, the biggest problem is that it doesn't rank things based on quality, it ranks by *popularity*, which is often very different. On reddit, whatever gets the most upvotes the fastest is the ""best"", which means a subreddit's content inevitably drifts towards things that are quick to view, easy to understand, but never truly ""solved"" because it's inherent in the site's entire model.

The experiment I've been considering is one that basically adds another system to allow people that have been actively and positively involved in the community to take a more direct role in how it's moderated. It would be somewhat of a middle ground between being a regular user (where your downvote can be canceled out by anyone else's upvote) and a moderator (where your removal overrules all votes). Here's how it would work:

By scraping data from the subreddit, how often they post/comment, how well their posts/comments generally do, etc. From those statistics, derive a (large) list of users that are high-quality, regular participants in the community.

Then set up a bot that will perform moderation actions if the action receives enough ""support"" from these users. For example, it takes the action. Other than removals, a few other actions could be supported through this as well, like adding the ""[Misleading title]"" tag that we use. Sending messages to a bot isn't very user-friendly, but unfortunately this is about the only way to add any functionality to reddit.

By using a weight system like this

Overall, if enough of the regular members of the subreddit agree that it doesn't belong, it could be removed.

What do you think? Is this an interesting idea that you'd be interested in at least trying out

It was in regards to the Big Mighty Poo boss battles in Conker's Bad Fur Day.  He says:

""This is still the best example of video games as art that we have to date.""

Uh

That's just sad.

Ok, the more seriously it took itself, the funnier the battle got. I get it.

So

**EDIT:**  04/24 - Arc System Works has removed the trailer that advertised online modes and uploaded a hastily edited variation of the japanese trailer.  This is how it looks now.

If you can't bother to decrypt his language I'll try to interpret it for you.

1. Microsoft is buying out publishers to not mention the PS4 versions of multi-platform titles

2. More in depth DRM info at Gamescom. There is no rental strategy

3. Cloud power was designed as DRM. It was Microsoft's idea

4. DRM plans are worse than what they have said.

5. Mirror's Edge 2 at MS conference. **not shown

6. Prince of Persia (reboot?) at MS conference. **not shown

7. Secret Phil Spencer game = World of Tanks. It is said that you still need Gold to play F2P games?

8. Paywall for Xbox One.

9. Dead Rising 3 as Xbox One exclusive. Exclusive DLC for another Capcom game.

10. No paywall for PS4

11. Sony is very tight on their DRM policies

**Fort Frolic - Bioshock** - the level where you first meet Sander Cohen.  Chilling and fascinating

**All Ghillied Up - COD4** - Back when COD was a lot more innovative

**Winter - The Last of Us** - Probably less a single level and more a large chunk of the game, a new villain was introduced, and we got to mix up who we played as.  The entire game is remarkable, but this section in particular was absolutely stunning and could have been its own amazing game.  I would probably consider this one to be my personal pick for level of the generation.

**The Department Store - Condemned** - probably not as well known

**The Forsworn (not sure what the mission is actually called) - Skyrim** - this mission was the epitome of what a good Elder Scrolls game is to me.  Immersion, a sense of power, and its own story arc that made it seem like such an epic, incredible journey that was just a couple of hours long.

**The big reveal - Bioshock Infinite** - I won't say anything about this.  Obviously refers to the last 15 minutes of Bioshock Infinite.

**The cargo plane - Uncharted 3** - Sure

Difficulty:

While the addition of sprinting , effectively nullifying the point of setting up a cosy shelter in the first place. This brings us onto the next point of the games near complete lack of progression in terms of weapon tiers and difficulty.


Risk vs. Reward: 

You start up a new map, all it takes after that is the tedium of mining either left or right until you strike diamond without ever needing to come into contact with an enemy. Even if you were to come into contact with an enemy at that depth, chances are they will still be the exact same as they were on the surface. I was excited when they finally added armour, enchantments and weapons to mobs, but then immediately disappointed when I found out that instead of spawning these harder mobs at a lower depth  they were spawned at a ridiculously lower percentage, no matter what depth. This is also true for many of the unique enemy types in the game such as the spider jockeys, charged creepers

With only 4 enemy types in the over world it seems nonsensical to have so many monsters which are rarely


Variety:

While I do believe that the more recent additions to farming are very much appreciated, along with an increase in the amount of building materials (metals, glass, bricks,etc) would satisfy users who only play creative mode as well. The near complete emptiness of the sea, save for one mob seems like a colossal waste of space; fish, seaweed, they could even add predators to scare people away from deep water. I could go on and on about potential addons but this thread isn’t a suggestion list. To put it simply


Mods:

I know alot of my issues with the game can be fixed with mods, I don’t expect Mojang to create as much content as the collective Minecraft community but I do expect some level of official support to help facilitate that community. 


Other Questionable design decisions:

This is more based on personal opinion if anything but a few additional issues I’ve got:

1)	NPC villagers should have never been added

2)	The End for a multitude of reasons; Firstly the entire boss fight is honestly one of the worst I’ve ever experienced in a game, who honestly thinks that is a satisfying conclusion? If anything the ‘ending’ for the game should’ve been more like Proteus, keeping it concise, and vague with multiple interpretations. OR to put it simply; no ending at all, it's a sandbox game it doesn't need one. Personally I’ve always envisioned MineCraft as a purgatory world, but that’s me and I’m sure other people don’t even care about the ‘story’ of the game.

That being said, two years is enough time for a full length sequel to be developed and released, but I had no problems with this: Valve never rush their products and triple A games take time. 

The problem lies in what they said at the time: they announced a trilogy of episodic content in 2006 ""that will conclude by Christmas of 2007""

Half Life 2 Episode 2 came out in October 2007

However

Valve, a release date, or anything. But after such a long gap, I think it's fair to say that episodic gaming simply hasn't worked for the series for one important reason: the whole justification behind it just didn't work out at all.

1350798325.0,11u0x1,Why I think Battlefield 3 is inferior to BF:BC2,Ganondorf_Is_God,2624,1400,871,"*Originally I was writing why I like BC2 more than BF3 for a forum. Over an hour it grew to this. I'm curious what other people think as well.*

Quite simply from someone who tries to objectively view games I find myself in a situation where I can say

There are numerous reasons why:

**Health/Damage disparity:** In BC2 you could take 1 or 2 more bullets from nearly every source. This made headshots worth more and made it so if you were skillful enough you could manage to get a kill when surprised by an enemy. In actuality you still have 100 hp... its the gun damages that were altered.

In BC2 the weapons of the offensive kits did about 14-16.7 damage per bullet. In BF3 they do 26-31. This means you die in 4 bullets in BF3 and 7 in BC2.

**The Guns:**
""Man I really like the ak-47! It's just feels like the best for me.""
""Yeah man
That crap is an illusion. Here are the gun stats from [BC2](http://denkirson.xanga.com/722757523/bad-company-2/) and [BF3](http://symthic.com/charts.php).

In BF3 almost all the guns are homogeneous in every way. Every gun class (assault rifle

Hell

In BC2 you had more variety. Different guns had special properties. Some had their damage drop off in different ways at a distance

I also enjoyed the potency of the pistols in BC2.

**The Maps:**
The maps in BC3 were almost entirely designed for consoles (by that I mean their max player cap per server). There were very few maps that played properly with 64 players. Hell

Hell

Too much close quarters combat. They appear to have been trying to cater to the CoD crowd here. I know that sounds like something a forum troll would say but seriously... CoD maps are all about closed sightlines and close quarters combat.

Battlefield is about large maps and large amounts of players battling it out with tons of vehicles and armaments. There are plenty of open areas in BF3 but they aren't places where you should normally be fighting. The funnel the players via incentives and choke points. An incentive is having an objective in a tunnel. A choke point is having to go into a tunnel to get to the objective. BF3 made the mistake of having a god damn inventive in a god damn choke point.

The system that Battlefield's 64 player combat created was that you didn't need large amounts of incentives or choke points to control the action. How it worked was simple. There were so many players that you were literally incapable of not running into someone.

Of course there many subtleties. Since there were two main bases you knew which direction the player would be coming from. Since players could spawn from captured points you knew that was also a possible direction they could be coming from. If you manage to come from an unexpected direction you were almost guaranteed a kill.

This is why crap like Rush is just that

This includes:
Respawns close to the objectives
Better accuracy because they're camping (being prone)
Smaller profile to hit (they're prone so you are going to have a hard time hitting/seeing them)
Escalating advantage (you take out on point and then there is only one left. This makes it so you can't overwhelm one point when there forces are split. If 32 are fighting 32 and one side has a huge advantage I wonder who wins)

**The Vehicles:**
Honestly this is a big one. So many things were changed. First off the unlock system makes vehicular combat incredibly unfair for new players. This is especially true for anything that flys. The unlocks for jets are what let them fulfill a function for your team. A new player in a jet has no way to defend themselves from the one billion rockets locked on to them or that Ace Pilot Lt. General RapeStorm coming his way with missiles locked on

No vehicle in a Battlefield game (hell

The whole lock-on thing in general kinda sucks. It forces you to bring certain unlocks. It also raises another problem... too many players. The more players in the game the more lock-on sources... but the amount of vehicles doesn't change.

Bad Company 2 did it right and a bit wrong. Vehicles had a powerful presence and were hard to deal with but still being vulnerable to a foot soldier. Even someone ready to take one down would have to have a bit of skill to do it. You had two options hit it with dumbfire explosives (or the vaguely 'guided' launchers) or tag that beast with a tracer dart. This was a solid system because if they were flying in a way that made them hard to hit with the dart pistol then their crew had an incredibly hard time aiming.

When every player can lock-on to your vehicle with a two hit kill launcher from anywhere on the map you need to have a system for the pilot to be able avoid those lock-ons. This results in a single individual being almost incapable of taking down a chopper/jet.

The only problem was when you had a blackbird at the top of the skybox. This created several problems... namely that you literally couldn't stop it. They were higher than you so you couldn't ascend up to them in another blackbird because you couldn't aim your guns straight up... so they would spray you with miniguns until you exploded. They had a permanent floating spawn point.

My solution... lower the damn skybox.

My last issue is the disabled vehicle status in Battlefield 3. It caused several problems.
1. Investment vs reward: In order to take it down in a traditional manner you need to role engineer. You risk life and limb to fire 2-5 rpgs at this beast. You may get lucky and have the rear be exposed or you might risk even more trying to get a line of sight on its ass. You take your shots and bam... 100 points. They all get out of the disabled pos and either get away or get picked off by the rest of your team. Sure you can nab one too but what the hell.

You rolled engineer to blow these things up. A big hulking monstrosity full of players being destroyed should result in the points for 1x hulking monstrosity and 4x players housed within.

2. Only two good ways to blow them up and be properly rewarded. C4 or landmines. C4 is for active destruction (see a tank and blow it up). You can destroy it all at once and everyone inside. Landmines are for passive destruction (ambiently protecting your bases and maps). Land mines have the same property of being able to destroy armor in one go. You need 3 each to completely destroy a vehicle. Additionally landmines don't despawn when you die (which I agree with... but not when launchers aren't viable like they are in BF3) which further compounds their advantage.

**The Server Browser:**
Holy crap. The battle-log is just that... a nice floating log in a toilette. When it works it works well enough. But it never works. Either someone appears offline for no reason, and so much more. Playing with your friends on the same team has never been so difficult.

My main complaint is it has all sorts of unique issues in every browser. It's a hulking crapsack. Battlefield has a history of releasing unusable server browsers but in this day and age... come on. It feels like BF2142 all over again.

**The Ranking System:**
Not too many gripes here. It takes a bit too long to level up into class defining mechanics. Hell

**The Little Things:**
Lets start with scope glare. Well all sniper scopes have the same two types of glare. A crapload or none at all. That's right that 6x has the same amount of glare as a 12x. Fine

The flashlight. I just personally find it retarded. Sure even in real life you can temporarily render someone incapable of seeing properly if your light source has a high luminous intensity. I might also add that your eyes aren't nearly as susceptible to this if they are adjusted to daylight.

How certain unlocks are unlocked on a per-gun basis. I don't know what kind of mentally handicapped soldier I am that I can't just remove the scope I unlocked on one gun onto another. Hell

**Destructibility:**
How BF3 has less destructibility on maps then BC2. Buildings don't collapse, and generally less crap being blow-up-able. This is just another feature that was lost. I enjoyed the changing dynamic of the maps during a game. In the first ten minutes people took cover in this building. At the twenty minute mark that building was a hole in the ground so they all moved on to new locations. That rooftop where all those noob snipers camp bothering you? Blow it the @#$% up.

**Realism is not equivalent to fun nor is it the antithesis:**
People complain about realism in games or want more. If realism adds to the game in a positive way then implement the feature. If it doesn't... then avoid it like the plague.

I'd like to talk about skill in Cod games. Your aim in CoD is far from the most important thing a player needs to succeed. The only real skill in CoD is your ability to move around the map in a way that offers you the most advantageous sight lines while denying your opponent theirs. Being able to do this in an unpredictable manner is the highest level of skill in that game.

As a gamer who enjoyed Unreal Tournament, and more I understand how this kind of skill is important... but I also understand how being shot at and dying with zero chance of retaliation in a 'game' is not fun.

Creating a game that has reasonable health pools along with this skill in using sight lines is what creates a competitive fps game with a high skill cap. People often mistake this for the argument of health vs damage. It isn't. It's encounter duration vs player ability (using sight lines and accuracy).

CoD is popular because it's modern setting which appeals to a wide demographic (and it's a setting which lets new players adjust faster and become invested in quicker due to it's familiarity) and how easy it is to do good (and bad).

**In Closing:**
Battlefield Bad Company 2 was a lot closer to the sweet spot in 'encounter duration vs player ability' and differentiated itself from the competition.

Battlefield 3 while advancing graphics steps further from that sweet spot while attempting to play like its competition. These two factors make for a game that is less fun, and a game that no longer exists within it's own niche.

To me personally it feels like Battlefield 3 wanted to become CoD like draw in its user base and instead of evolving the features of the Battlefield IP (large combat

I like CoD (as a player, lose a ton of features, and stagnate.

1365538927.0,1c0gzr,"Kerbal Space Program, a game which was using the distribution method popularized by Minecraft and promising alpha purchasers ""all future updates for free"" has now come out and stated it intends to release an expansion pack that it will charge alpha purchasers for. Do you consider this fair?",BulldogFanNH,2496,1280,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1c0gzr/kerbal_space_program_a_game_which_was_using_the/

Here is [reddit thread regarding the stream where it was first mentioned](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1bxuwp/summary_of_dev_team_announcements_for_020_and/). The [video of the stream itself is linked here

The expansion is heavily discussed in [this thread directly addressing the topic

For posterity(because SkunkMonkey has indicated the language will be changed shortly) this is a screenshot of the About page for the game which has since alpha release included the statement.

&gt;[During development, you get the game for a lot less, and you'll get all future updates for free.](http://imgur.com/XCNvlei)

The [FAQ page](http://imgur.com/BdoR2Cq) on the official site reaffirms this with...

&gt;**If I buy the game now will I have to buy it again for the next update?**

&gt;No

---------------

In short SkunkMonkey has asserted an expansion cannot be in any way considered an update. [He also argues it's unreasonable to expect any company to give all additions to the game to alpha purchasers and that no company has ever done anything like that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1byoiz/we_now_know_that_squad_plans_to_release_paid/c9br697/) He has yet to respond to the suggestion that Mojang is a successful game company who offered alpha purchasers the same ""all updates for free"" promise and has continued to deliver on that promise 2 years after the game's official release. 

Do you think SkunkMonkey is correct in his argument or do you think there is merit to the users who are demanding that Squad release the expansion free of cost to the early adopters who purchased the game when it was stated in multiple places on the official sites that ""all future updates"" would be free of cost to alpha purchasers? Is there merit to the idea that the promise was actually ""all updates for free except the ones we decide to charge for"" that has been mentioned several times in the threads linked? 

It should be noted that some of the content mentioned for the expansion had been previously touched upon by devs several times before the announcement there would ever be any expansion packs leading users to believe it was coming to the stock game they purchased. 

I think the big question at the center of this is how an update is defined. Is an update any addition or alteration to a game regardless of size or price? Should a company be allowed to get out of promising all updates for free simply by drawing a line in front of certain content and declaring it to be an expansion. 

Edit: Not sure how this is a misleading title when since it was posted Squad Community Manager /u/SkunkMonkey has been on aggressively defending Squad's right to begin charging early adopters for content of Squad's choosing after version 1.0",,t5_2qhwp,1365599848.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1c0gzr/kerbal_space_program_a_game_which_was_using_the/

By far the largest complaint we see about /r/Games is a worry about declining quality of comments and discussions. We've already taken a couple of measures toward helping this over the past few months:

1. [We've been putting an ""[/r/all]"" tag on threads that reach the first couple of pages of /r/all](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/10y64k/regarding_the_warning_rall_flair/) to warn that that comments will likely include a lot of people that don't normally visit the subreddit (and often don't even realize it's not the same subreddit as /r/gaming). Of course this doesn't actually *improve* the comments in any way
2. A lot of you may not even realize this, ""came here to post this"", etc. as well as comments that consist entirely of a link to a gif or meme are automatically removed immediately after they're posted. This has overall been very effective and successful, with hardly any false positives (which get manually un-removed).

So that's helped somewhat, and I've seen many instances of perfectly reasonable comments being heavily downvoted just because the poster was defending an unpopular opinion. For example, most comments expressing anything positive towards ""popular to hate"" games like Diablo III, Final Fantasy XIII, The War Z, any CoD, etc. will receive quite a few downvotes regardless of the actual quality of the comment.

This is unfortunate, since some of the best discussions are based around disagreements.

So here's an idea for a potential **experiment** (meaning if it doesn't work out

---

Before I get into any details, users using RES, etc.) are all still able to downvote.

However, I strongly suspect that the majority of users access the site through a standard browser using the subreddit CSS, so there should definitely be a decent reduction. Really, we can't know how well it would work without trying it.

Now, etc. Go look at the bottom of some of the comments pages of some popular posts in /r/Games, you'll see plenty of examples. So if we were to try out hiding the arrow, it would also need to be combined with **more moderators, and increased comment moderation**.

We would recruit multiple users that are active in the community and contribute quality comments often, but only ones that have no value at all. Similar to the ones that AutoModerator already does remove, just with more flexibility due to that whole ""human judgment"" thing. So basically if the comment truly did deserve to be downvoted, you could report it to the mods instead for removal.

In addition, but I think if we want to really start trying to clean up the comments it may be necessary. Of course, one of the reasons that we don't use the ban system is that it's extremely easy to circumvent. Whenever you ban a user on reddit, they're sent a private message telling them they were banned, and they can go create a new account in seconds to continue posting. So this would likely have to be combined with having AutoModerator automatically remove all comments made by users less than a day old or something along those lines to make it less trivial to circumvent.

Anyway

* Hide the downvote arrow on comments (**not** submissions

* Start removing extremely poor comments and banning users that consistently post them.

* Increase number of moderators to handle this additional workload.

&gt;Hey guys
&gt;I just saw this note and saw this issue (I was at comicon all day).
&gt;For 100% transparency here is the mistake that led to this issue. Note this was absolutely a mistake
&gt;On Thursday we learned that there would no longer be a pre-load for SimCity. In response I set up a mass mail to go out to every customer who had pre-ordered the game up until we found out there wasn't a pre-load anymore.
&gt;When I filed this request
&gt;So, we also cancelled all the orders.
&gt;Again

Essentially we (TEST) have separated from our former allies due to cultural reasons. In addition to resetting the CFC a couple months ago and the recent departure of Pandemic Legion

We are retaining a small number of allies that hold space near to us but the official leadership stance is to reduce our blues (allies) and not take part in another coalition. As we hold a massive amount of space we are going to be stretched very thin

This should lead to the megawar of the summer.

 - Top comment of that article is pure snark and the thread there degenerates into ivory tower sarcasm and eye rolling.

 - Then a lot of other articles are pretty much anti-EA/SimCity biased articles. While it's relevant and I don't mind new information be upvoted. **A lot of the same points are being raised over and over**. It feels like someone went ""guy's the cake is a lie

 - Overall, to one of gaming mob mentality.

 - It also feelst like vestiges of the ""gaming taliban"" are lurking in this subreddit more and more

I'm probably not the first or last to observe this

I think people should justify their posts and comments more than just trying to get laughs or DAE posts.

**EDIT 3:** Obviously the title of this thread is exaggerated on a value to value basis - if you take a title like that literally your kind of missing the point, is definitely moving towards /r/gaming and that is the point I am driving at.

**EDIT 2:** I think mods should pretty much ruthlessly cull any post or comment that adds little to a discussion that they see.

**EDIT:** Some redditors think I have some kind of bias with this discussion, rather than actually discussing the core issue. It was ""agree with me and upvote me"" style post and I apologize if the comment I made on that thread was counterproductive, it was an emotional reaction to the lack of true discussion on this subreddit overall that I am seeing more and more. It means that those that want the status quo never have to defend their position, they never have to construct a decent argument, they just ignore and upvote and agree with eachother.

If you want to see my posts on the Bros before Hos topic, it was my emotive reaction to how downhill actual debate is in this subreddit.

1371459914.0,1gi8ef,"Final Fantasy XIV is in beta again, and this time... it's actually an impressively good game.",yamtaro,1605,465,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1gi8ef/final_fantasy_xiv_is_in_beta_again_and_this_time/, or perhaps a nice weekend distraction at best. Boy

I'm writing this because after having now experienced FFXIV it is painfully disappointing to see such a lack of discussion and anticipation around what really feels like an exceptionally good game.

FFXIV somehow manages to re-capture a feeling I got playing FF games like VI, and XI--a feeling which, to me, is absent from SE's other, later releases. This game *feels* like a Final Fantasy title worthy of the name. I'm going to hit on what stood out to me about the game and why you should consider FFXIV a game worth experiencing when it is released later this year.



**1. Atmosphere:**

Holy shit this this thing is one of the most immersive game worlds I have ever experienced. Every detail within the game's environment has been carefully thought about to enhance your interaction with a cohesively designed world that really feels like it is a living, this game feels like Tokyo. Dense, no space wasted; strange and beautiful.

Light beams radiate through dense forest canopy, weather and light changes, and with it the instruments and emotion of the background music being played. Rainy day? Chipper harp and piano arrangement evolve into *fucking sad xylophones.* That's right. Playing this game is like some sort of Synaesthesic fever climax of the eyes, ears, and fingertips.

On the beta forums you can tell this is a special concern of the game designers. To give you a sense of this

**2. Gameplay**

The game world feels layered

Solo play is now a viable way to level. There are extra rewards for parties, an extra ability for each class, become available in parties. ""Exp chains"", extra experience granted for back-to-back monster slaying on an ever-shortening timer, can be racked up into rediculous numbers with the help of extra players. Lastly, if you attack a monster in a party, an equal number of monsters will attack *you*. In other words, 4 nearby monsters will retaliate. This means that playing in a party can be more rewarding

So far, and dungeons especially, are so far where FFXIV's combat seems to be the most fun. I'd say the game starts to really open up around level 15.

You can level any of the game's classes on a single character, or a Thaumaturge (Black mage) can level Marauder to give themselves 15 seconds of lifesteal. This is a good thing because this allows you play with your lower level friends, re-visit or explore new zones, or check out low-level content you missed, while still progressing your main character. Certain pairings of class levels unlock advanced jobs like ""Black mage"", ""Dragoon"", ""Summoner'. You'll want a lot of armor and weapons on hand for what the situation calls for, special inventory called the ""armory box"". The armory box comes with a gear changer that lets you save and flip quickly between item sets (and thereby

Finally, like ""city NPC needs a new pair of gloves"", and what not. Every 5 levels you return to your craft guildmaster and make some special thing for them and they reward you with something very nice to enhance your craft. Currently it looks like you actually *make* money leveling crafting, but I'm not sure it will be this way at release.



**3. Story**

I feel like all of these immersive experiences culminate in FFXIV's excellent story. The previous Final Fantasy MMO was renowned for its great story, but FFXIV has been quite the exception. The localization is simply amazing, too. Definitely not one to be missed!

He showed me how to charge the controller and how to get a game or movie to play, it took me a long time to learn the baseball game, but I wouldn't mind trying something else out, maybe that I could casually pick up and down.

so I suppose many of us have moments where we pause for a minute

I'd expect most of these situations arise when you're grinding like there's no morning in some games

Here's my moment of that kind:
Roughly 2 years ago I was watching through a lot *How I met your Mother* episodes as I just got into it. Because just doing a single thing at a time is too boring for us modern people I decided to play some game while watching.

I loved *Dragon Quest Monsters* on GBC when I was young and found out about *Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker* for the DS. Because I had no DS I decided to emulate it on one of the DS emulators on PC.
While I didn't think the game was particularly great I did enjoy it to some degree and wanted to play through all of it.

Now I don't know too much about the normal DQ games but DQM on GBC was already super grindy and well DQM:J turned out to be even worse. Because you want to raise up a lot monsters to combine them to stronger ones (and repeat) you have to grind an ungodly amount of XP. And as a lot of you may be aware the Metal Slimes and further evolutions of 'em provide lots of XP but are a bit more rare to encounter and hard to kill as they have high armor (thus evade chance) and flee quite often.
There's one extra castle area where you are allowed into a Metal Slime and co. only are after successfully passing a really annoying mini-quest where you have to run around the castle for a few minutes

In essence
And although I finished at least the most important part of the game already (there may have been an additional tournament after that

Now there was another place close to one of the end bosses where there was a chance for *Liquid Metal Slimes* to spawn randomly. I started grinding there. But it took forever as well...
So again
I starting using them more and more to the point where I was quicksaving so

In the end I probably sat there for 30mins doing barely anything other than reloading savestates again and again and again. I then stopped and just thought:
""What the fuck am I doing here? This is the furthest away from 'having fun' I can get and getting stronger monsters won't really do much for me anyways. I'm not even playing this game anymore

After that I felt so terrible

1372872778.0,1hkum8,Steam should have a Tip Jar,Ardaron9,2239,1120,284,"Greetings

As an adult gamer who has a steady job and ''some'' disposable income, that after playing them, I would have gladly paid much more for the quality and content of the game.

So here is an idea: Steam should have a tip jar service. The tip would go directly to the game producer (maybe Steam could keep a 5% to manage the service) Since giving a tip would be 100% voluntary it would be another incentive for game developers to offer quality content over cheap quickly produced shit.

Here is a little list of games I like so much I wish to give them a tip:

- Bastion (20$)

- The Binding of Issac (10$)

- Braid (5$)

- Defender's Quest (5$)

- Endless Space (10$)

- Mount &amp; Blade Warbands (10$)

- Terraria (20$)

### Comment moderation

This is the big one. I'm putting this topic at the top with larger text and a lot more detail than the others because it would be a very big change, we don't remove comments in /r/Games. It doesn't matter if someone's blatantly trolling, being racist, etc. We don't remove it, and just let the voting system handle it. But we've seen some concerns lately with the quality of comments starting to drop here, and this is a potential approach to try to improve things a bit.

One thing to keep in mind is that the threads that generally have the lowest comment quality are the ones that get exposed to ""the outside"" somehow, people that don't subscribe to /r/Games flood into it, and the comments almost always--to put it bluntly--go to shit. There are also various other subreddits that can have a similar effect, such as /r/bestof, /r/SubredditDrama, and so on. It's almost impossible to stop this from happening, even if we did start to moderate comments. When a large portion of the audience for a particular thread isn't ""from around here"", because it probably can't. Unless the admins ever implement some way for subreddits to opt-out of /r/all

Now, and any comments that aren't directly answering that question in a scientific manner can be removed. But /r/Games isn't like that, the focus here isn't on correct answers, but on discussion. And there simply isn't an objective measure for whether a particular comment is ""good discussion"". Sometimes even some of the comments that seem the worst actually end up being a ""trigger"" that starts off a great discussion, and if they had been removed, that ensuing discussion may never have occurred.

So if anything, so it doesn't really seem necessary to actually remove them. Getting smacked with a bunch of downvotes might even be more effective than removal in showing the user that comments like that aren't encouraged, since a comment's author can't easily tell that it was removed, and they'll just see it sit there with no votes in either direction.

Thoughts? Would you like to see comments moderated at all

---

And some other topics to consider:

**Kickstarter** - I think the ""no Kickstarter reminder posts"" rule has been working quite well for keeping Kickstarter posts from overwhelming the subreddit, and might give some worthy projects the last-minute kick that they need to get across their funding goal, but what do you think?

**Giveaways** - There have been a number of posts recently for giveaways of beta keys and such. These aren't specifically banned in the subreddit, but also trading and giveaways.

**""Accessory"" suggestions** - Recently it's been quite common to have people asking for suggestions for headsets, etc. These are all items that don't really have anything specifically to do with gaming, but can be relevant for gamers anyway. Do you think these are good discussions to have here, or should these sorts of questions be directed somewhere else, like we already do for anyone asking for PC hardware advice?

I've got a very saddening tale to tell here. I'll tell it from the top.

Do you guys remember coming from StarCraft 1 and WarCraft 3? How we thought StarCraft 2 would be the golden age of RTS? How

We got a rude shock when we came into the beta. The custom map system was not like anything we expected. It also didn't work. But we trusted Blizzard to fix it. After all they always have in the past right? The game is releaced with record sales and rightly so. It was the RTS of the decade after all. Made by the most popular company out there.

Literally the day after the Galaxy Editor came out I dug right into making mods. I was pretty much brand new to it. I had done a little programming before but no on this scale. I figured out the Trigger editor pretty quickly but the data editor was a new mystery. I worked on my first map

Hence I had my first experience with an editor that was never properly tested. I then moved onto make a shooter and I made a pretty good system

I started by trying Troopers vs Zombies a second time. I successfully followed a guide to make a WarCraft 3 hero system (thank you bifu!) and another guide gave me a few pieces of the puzzle to make a WarCraft 3 style item shop done in data. I also learned how to change the model for the mineral as well as the model the worker carried back. So now I had mules ""dumpster diving"" into dumpsters and carrying back trash cans. This was a world destroyed by zombies after all. I gained a lot of experience with actors doing that. That took about 6 months of my time.

At this time I was starting to notice

I then spent the next 3 months coming up with a workable amphibious system. I even had a promo version of map published so people could keep up on its state of development. To my shock it made it to page 3 in this almost completely broken stage. After 3 months of experimentation I decided to use the system WW2 Diplo/Fate of the Empire has now. It was the first amphibious system in any map. Of this I think I can be proud of. It has served me well and I've had more than a few people ask me how I made it.

So 1.3.5 came out with the ""fun or not"" system. I couldn't believe it. I knew that there were 2 schools of ""fixing"" the system and this solution seemed to come out of the blue. This was the Blizzard we all knew and loved wasn't it? Were they not given enough time (over 6 months) to fix it? At this point my disillusionment with Blizzard began.

I spent the next 8 months trying to organize the StarCraft 2 wargaming community. It started off with having a plentiful amount members. But in long conversations with them I began noticing a trend. More and more people were starting to lose faith in Blizzard.

My biggest moment though was back when the map allowed for 14 players. We had 14 (full lobby!) and 2 left making 12. The lag was horrendous but all of us had a good time. This was classic diplomacy at its best! Everyone ruthless and backstabbing, even though incomplete was what made all those months of work worth it.

However, off and on, to perfect the map. But my best efforts could not stop what I could no longer honestly deny - the community was dying.

The reason was obvious. It came from the players themselves. ""The stupid popularity system"". Along with that came statements of ""Blizzard will never fix it"". I decided to join those voices. My mother had been a political activist for a while and her aim mostly succeeded (you will never completely succeed against government). I was very familiar with the concept of making noise. Others were starting to do it

I stuck around

At the same time we began seeing disturbing signs. Blizzard was featuring maps that needed no help and were also very old - having been at the top of the list for quite some time. Then there was the infamous press release saying that the the mapping community had some very talented mappers and some ""great maps"" out there. He even made a list. What did he list off? The first set of maps on the first page. Claiming that the community was ""strong and vibrant"" when we all knew that the opposite was really true was a major point that solidified the idea that ""Blizzard doesn't care"".

There were flame wars between the fanboys and the complainers and people continued to leave the scene - and not a moderator or community manager or developer to be seen. They would disappear for over 6 months and then make a single post in a thread about some major drama that popped up. And people continued to leave.

And then we heard about patch 1.5. Here I was

Then I got a chance email from Blizzard support agent.  They were having trouble with my map and they wanted me to send them the map. I saw the email 2 hours after it was sent and sent them the map. I got a real surprise when a senior software engineer sent me an email thanking me for being prompt about the map and giving me a beta key. This was a real boost. The forums were a lost cause and getting anything through Sixen's private line of communication was pointless given that I wasn't among his favorites but now, including ones with dependencies ironed out as well as critical information about issues affecting every single custom model. Many other bugs and possibilities were explored. I made a point of, without ""over-taxing"" the pip of getting this developer exposed to many issues that people were having. At last I finally had a way past the ****ing community managers who seemed to be both corrupt (backdoor deals with Sixen) and playing favorites. 

However it was one of a few emails that I received after requesting something and I got back from this contact that sent me on my current collision course:
""I know you’ve been waiting on the art tools but I haven’t had any news to share on those since we last spoke. I know that they are still being worked on
Now I never did get them. I do not in any way fault this contact. Someone higher up or a community manager made the decision. However I did not know anything about this until it was

Gradually my correspondence with the contact fell off. As I said before I never received the art tools never got told that I would not be getting them. Still it had been a very productive month or two. A real boost to moral to say the least.

However the community managers proved as obstinate as ever in trying to block all of my attempts to get in. I highly doubt a single post (most of which had turned diplomatic again as a result of my email correspondence) ever made it through - and not just my own either.

Then I learned that two other developers were reachable. I decided to test the water out. I found out very quickly that both of them were rather new

Questions about the art tools and one of my friend's speculations gradually became a clear picture of the art tools being HotS only. This, after all, still expecting the premium map market about the time of HotS - many of us were.

My map projects gradually ground down to a halt because of issues with all of the ported and custom models I was using in all of them that only the art tools could fix. I tried a third one

So I tried to find other outlets for my energies as I awaited HotS. I found out by my discussions with these two new developers that the Data Editor Documentation would not include any newbie guides and tutorials. They would rely on the community to make those. At this an alarm bell went off in my head: ""...umm... the 'community' you refer to who can write this documentation kinda doesn't exist - its barely a few people"".

Now instead of going off on the forums with a giant expose or something like that I decided to offer to write the beginner documentation myself. All I wanted was it to be on the main Blizzard website. They didn't have anything in the works to replace it and at least it would be visible and Blizzard could say that they wrote something.

I even came up with how to do it. I made it ""object"" based where each ""chapter"" is designed to get the modder to learn how to make progressively more and more complex things. The first one was ""making your first unit from scratch."" I even made a visual he could take to a meeting: http://i1088.photobucket.com/albums/i333/marshallwellington/Data-Tutorials-1.jpg

However nothing became of that and I decided to drop it. Later on I found out that the UI of the data editor was being changed. At this point 2 alarms went off in my head. One: if he manages to break something almost every map is going to break and he will quickly find himself out of a job and two: this is a person who is brand new to the job and the community - he could easily make it worse and what he did modify so far didn't do much to allay my fears.

So I offered to help. I was pushing the wizzards idea and I found out that they were unsure of how to design them. I offered the following:
Break it down into ""component wizzards"" and make a new UI stream-lined around wizzards. For an ability choosing to add an effect would open up another wizzard where you could create the effect. Granted it would mean a screen full of wizzards but you can easily put checks into make sure there isn't a ""child"" wizzard open.
Here was a layout. I broke the effects portion down into 4 ""master effects"" and 7 ""applied effects"". Here were the 4 ""master effects"": http://i1088.photobucket.com/albums/i333/marshallwellington/EffectCreator-MasterEffects.jpg
This was the sort of layout he asked for. But unfortunately that one also didn't work out either.

So there I was. Nothing I wanted to play. Nothing to do with the game. A lot of time already invested into it. Every route I tried to improve the situation turned out to be false.

I'd had enough. So I told the Blizzard forums I'm leaving and withdrew my maps.

They

I did send an email the 2 developers (the senior developer and the new guy) thanking them for all the help they've given me and those that worked with me. Also showing the new guy that email from the senior developer I kept telling him about.

I get a reach-out email from the forum team. But am not un-banned and no apology.

I'm happy though. The drama is over with. I had some good times and I managed to greatly increase my skill as a programmer. I learned extremely valuable CG skills on top of it and over all I think I gained from all the work. At the same time if Blizzard goes down the drain I won't feel the slightest bit guilty. No one can say I didn't go the extra mile to make it work.",,t5_2qhwp,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ffky/the_tale_of_a_starcraft_2_modder/

Just about every game I've pre-ordered in recent years, and played for just a few hours each. 

I understand publishers like to be able to gauge how well a game is going to sell based on the pre-orders, there's already a release date. If the game was going to be crappy in the world before pre-ordering existed, it's still going to be crappy with the money they get from pre-orders. 

An exception would be indie games

However

Pre-ordering, but there were no reviews on the site, no star ratings, and the shipping date was 6 months from now. No one would ever do it, and yet we line up to pre-order games. It baffles me. 

Yes, seeing how frequently they pre-ordered games and how frequently they regret it.

Edit: didn't expect this to be such a popular topic! For all the people saying, sure, that was a great option back when pre-orders were just a way of reserving a copy in a store. Now you almost universally miss out on some kind of content if you don't pre-order, be it just cosmetic content, or weapon packs, or other DLC, or even promises of future DLC. If so many gamers didn't let publishers get away with the pre-order scam, no strings attached,False,

### New moderators

As part of our constant struggle to keep the quality up as the subreddit continues to grow, so please be sure to report any submissions or comments that violate the rules so that they can be looked at. If something especially needs attention, please send a modmail instead, since that often gets noticed sooner (and also allows you to explain the problem, since reports don't have a reason attached).

### E3 ""event threads""

As we did with the PS4 and Xbox One reveal events, only *reactions*. Sites aren't posting analyses of the announcements, generally just reiterations of the same thing that was stated in the event. And similarly, commenters on reddit are only posting quick reaction comments, while still trying to follow the rest of the event. So in the interest of improving overall subreddit quality, we're going to keep everything related to the event in one thread while it's still in progress, and then afterwards you'll be welcome to create new submissions to discuss specific announcements.

There have been some complaints about the quality of the updates posted in the previous event threads, and it's more difficult than it looks to be constantly updating with much quality while still trying to keep up with what's continuing to happen in the event.

Please also note that comment moderation will not be done at its usual level in the event threads. Some of the very worst comments may be removed, the event thread itself will almost certainly be a lost cause.

### Official /r/Games E3 team

In case you missed it, hopefully it'll add a little more ""interactivity"" to E3 for the subreddit.

### General reminders

Just a few quick reminders of rules and some general guidelines in /r/Games:

* Please try to avoid voting based on whether you agree/disagree with comments or submissions. Comments should be voted on based on whether they contribute to the discussion, etc.) please report them so they can be removed.
* Avoid sensationalizing or editorializing the titles of submissions. The title should not include your opinion on the content you're submitting. In general, please report the submission so that we can tag or remove it.
* Blogspam (sites embedding content from other sources without adding anything significant) is not allowed. If you are submitting, please report it so that it can be removed.
* Excessive promotion is not allowed. In addition to blogspam, you should give the impression of being ""a redditor with a website"", not ""a website with a reddit account"".
* [Don't ask for votes or otherwise manipulate voting](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/). This includes asking for votes on Twitter, etc. This is against [reddit's site-wide rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules) and will result in your submission being removed. If you see anyone manipulating votes, please send us a modmail so we can investigate.

On the other hand though, Nethack, look like Mazogs (which was crammed into 1k on the ancient ZX81). Mine out some stone, haul it to a workshop, make a pot out of it, have a brewer claim the pot and turn it into a barrel of hooch, and then store the booze for a year or two — and if a dwarf who eventually gets a drink from the barrel has a particular fondness for the type of rock you mined the stone from, which genuinely might be the difference between everything going well

Secondly, because he can’t find clean socks — might decide (entirely on his own accord) to murder a colleague, drag the corpse to a workshop, and turn it into a skull-topped spine-bone scepter, complete with little decorative carvings of the socks he can’t find. He will be celebrated for this achievement. It might even cheer the victim’s bereaved spouse up. Mothers have been known to go into battle wielding their own newborns as particularly hideous bludgeons. Entire Dwarven forts have been slaughtered by undead clam-shells. Please don’t ask about the Giant Sponges of Doom, flaming elephant madness, commemorative gold statues of the King of the Dwarves lying in a fetal position surrounded by sneering cockroaches

Thirdly, so you can try all sorts of options out. There’s a rudimentary power system available, so you can create devices that Heath Robinson and Rube Goldberg would have marvelled at. These frequently involve lava. Some people construct fractal bedroom complexes — I know, I’ve seen them, and they look stunning.

There are easy ways into Dwarf Fortress. The *Lazy Newb Pack* is an alternate download that helps make installation straight-forward and provides tile-sets and vital tools. Youtube Dutchman Captnduck has a series of vids entitled *DFVIDTUTS2012*

I totally understand that you shouldn’t need to buy a goddamn book just to get through the initial set-up screen of a free computer game. Dwarf Fortress really **isn’t** for many people. You have to be really quite anal, then do yourself a favour and go watch Captain Duck.

**New sidebar** - The old sidebar was extremely long and had a lot of the important information buried in it, you can view the new sidebar here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/about/sidebar

**Responding to discussion topics with a game's name and no detail or explanation is no longer allowed** - When someone makes a discussion topic like ""What stealth games most capture the feeling of sneaking around and have the most immersive atmosphere?""

**Downvote arrow hidden for comments** - This was one of the main possibilities being discussed in the thread last week

**Extremely low quality comments will be removed** - Since downvotes will be less accessible, please report it. Note that this doesn't mean comments you disagree with, or that you think are incorrect. I'm talking about things like someone posting ""this game is shit"" on a news submission, etc. Users that consistently and repeatedly post awful comments may also be banned from the subreddit.

**Self-posts/suggestion threads will be moderated a little more strictly** - One of the most common complaints recently has been related to the declining quality of submissions from users that check the new page. There are a lot of very straightforward or repetitive questions being posted, /r/ShouldIBuyThisGame, etc. Self-posts to /r/Games should have the potential to generate a significant discussion.

I think this is completely unacceptable. For me

I see Valves problem from a monetary point-of-view (games are cheaper in Russia / the US than in Europe)

As an adult German I am allowed to buy uncut games. Why won't Valve let me? The German community has been asking for an age verification system for years now and we have gotten basically no answers at all. 

Edit: Most reputable gifters never used the system to get rich. All they asked for was a small tip and paypal-fees. Seriously Valve

**Edit2:** There seems to be a lot of misinformation concerning the German system. Therefore I'll add some infos on how it actually works.

Basically you have two big players:

The USK (German self-monitoring of entertainment software) and the BPJM (Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons). If a publisher wants to publish a game in Germany, ""12+"", ""16+"" and ""18+"". There restrictions are legally binding for the retail sector. If the USK thinks a game is too violent (rascist, etc.) it can refuse classification. In this case the BPJM can index the game which basically means an automatic 18+ rating AND prohibition to advertise the game (which includes displaying the game in retails stores). Buying the game as an adult is still allowed, but getting it can be a problem. Some retailers still have such games below the counter, but if you don't want to buy on the Internet you're probably screwed. Again this is not a situation (directly) forced by law, but a decision made by the retailers due to, low sales.

Important to note is that not the German government censors games. The publishers do

Now online it's a really difficult case. Basically Steam already does illegal things by selling USK 16+ rated games to teens. But nobody seems to care. German players just want an age verification system that lets people buy games they could also buy in a German retail / online store.

**Edit3:** Games actually can get banned in Germany. This is the third, but IANAL). Whatever, this case is not that importat, because it happens very rarely.

**Concerning proof:** I understand and respect your skepticism

**Concerning proof 2:** Just talked to someone who can post proof on Tuesday. He's not home at the moment.

* Games in the 2009 sale were a lot older. The average game was a little less than two years old (643 days ex. Morrowwind)
* THQ has steeper discounts
* The average discount (1-sum(sale_price)/sum(base_price)) on the 2009 sale was 58%

Three years ago, [Solitaire.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitaire_%28Windows%29) I won almost every game, so I decided to try something different: I wanted to get all the ""tableaux"" (those four lines of cards) built without putting any cards up on the foundations (the outlines in the upper-right corner where you put the aces and stack cards). I spent a few weeks trying, but I always got stuck with a few downturned cards. I eventually decided it was impossible and gave up...

... for a few months. I kept coming back and trying to win

But I kept trying—not obsessively, at 11:17 PM last night, I beat the game according to my completely arbitrary rules. I don't think what I did is impressive: it probably just took me three years to get a winnable hand, and someone else could probably do what I did on their first try. But I've played a lot of video games, and this is one of my proudest video game accomplishments. TL;DR, I need to get out more.  ",,,,

It seemed to me like they simply wanted to find something ""off-beat"" about this already monstrous person. 

Besides the poor spelling, Larry McShane. I asked him why he felt it was necessary to include this information at all. To my surprise, he responded right away. He explained that the authorities were hoping Beaudrie would show up at conventions, where he might be apprehended. *Well okay then, that makes sense*. But why didn't he say that in the first place, instead of just leaving that factoid there, context-free?

He seemed to realize the implications, the tagline was removed and the mention of Yu-Gi-Oh! and M:TG was clarified with, ""and may be traveling the country visiting conventions and trade shows."" 

The moral of this (potentially boring) story? SPEAK UP! If you see a journalist lazily suggesting a link between gaming and corrupt morals

As long as I have your attention

**edit for clarification** The part of the article that reads ""and may be traveling the country visiting conventions and trade shows"" *was added later* after I emailed the author of the article. I now understand why the information was included,,False,,t5_2qhwp,1339531113.0,,True

There was an update yesterday that has completely corrupted everyone's save file and then when you do restart the game it freezes every single time after you complete the obnoxious training level. No amount of system cache clearing or reinstalling makes a difference. Team 17 has not responded in any way on their official forums even though I find it highly unlikely that they don't have someone monitoring those on the weekend. As of right now the game is 100 percent broken. I would also have to guess that this update was not playtested in the least consider that it's happening to every single person who has the game. How could that go unnoticed if it was ever tested? ,t5_2qhwp,True

More specifically I'm talking about the likes of ""We Don't Go To Ravenholm"" in Half-Life 2, and many other levels. 

Personally, but these parts of games are almost always the most memorable for me. I feel that they are a nice change of pace and keep the game fresh. A well-done, suitably creepy section, where the player walks into an area and realizes something is wrong, can be just as effective at keeping the player engaged than any million-dollar set piece. A lot of times I actually find myself more creeped out by these singular sections than an actual, dedicated horror game, probably because it is unexpected and forces the player to rethink how the game is played.

Now, and I hope devs continue to do this.

Bonus: It had set itself up to start with Windows via registry key. Didn't ask me or anything

I reinstalled the thing and did some digging. I found that the game shortcut pointed to aeria_launcher.exe, prompts you to install it; then it checks if Ignite is running, and if it isn't, starts it; then it launches the REAL launcher, _Launcher.exe. No integration hooks or anything actually useful; just a malicious pseudo-launcher that forces you to run their crap.

Yes, change the shortcut to point to _Launcher.exe, and play the game without their ""required"" crapware, no problem. So the app does, literally, NOTHING. Just yet another chunk of useless code to potentially cause problems.

It's been a while now and I'm starting to get the hang of the system.  I've figured out how to navigate the opening screen to play movies and games, so he bought it for me and showed me how to start it and played through a little bit of it with me to teach me how to move around.  I like it, because it waits on me to think when i'm in ""battle"".  I guess the game we got him was for a different system and won't work on this one, how they got it to be available without a disc or cartridge I don't quite get, but it's there on the system.  

I went out and got two other games, although when my son last visited he showed me how to turn the difficulty down, which has made it a bit easier.  I still get turned around trying to run and aim and shoot, a bit too fast paced for me, but the story is interesting so far.  I'm hoping I can improve enough to get through the story.

Sure, one can argue that they are somewhat influenced by the details surrounding this particular trial, but these people are supposed to be professional psychiatrists. They should know and understand better than most how today's culture plays out, yet somehow the stereotypes and odd-out cases seems to have outweighed common friggin' sense. 

This was a questioning of the 2 psychatrists conlusions on Breivik's state of mind

Here's a link for anyone who haven't seen it (in norwegian

And here's a quick and rough translation of what is said in the video above:

**Judge:** You reached a conclusion of an undisputable personality change in 2006. More specifically, did you know what this game was all about?
	
**Psych 1:** Yes, we have no form of expertise when it comes to computer games.
	
**Judge:** Do you think the testimony of Breivik's co-player in-game on how he was so immersed in this game
	
**Psych 1:** No. We feel that playing a lot of computer games gives the impression of a working cognitive function. It is however, arrange meetings, go to work in the morning, have a healthy relationship with a girlfriend, or having common social skills.
	
**Judge:** About this period after 2006, mostly by himself alone in his room. Could an alternate inerpretation of this be described as being addicted to games?
	
**Psych 2:** Some would say that

*And then the kicker*:

**Psych 1:** I would still like to point out that sitting alone in your room and playing games, is not normal for a man in his 20's.

Sigh.

Hello! Thanks for this! It looks awesome. Anyways

**NOT SO FINAL EDIT**

I have made a couple of mistakes that I need to address. Firstly, so if anyone would like to be the test subject and report back, I'll give you a cookie. Secondly, if you want to contact me in game, you do not have to use the ""Urland"" bit - that was my mistake, I forgot surnames arn't used in game messages, so just do /tell Soza.

**IN REGARDS TO THE CITY**

~~We have a guild hall on Tatioone, so message me in game if you are interested.~~ 

~~This is currently subject to change as Tat is currently full of rank 4 cities.~~

We are currently searching for a city location on Lok/Dant.

Edit 1: That's meant to say *any questions. 

Disclaimer: **Is this Legal?**

~~100%. For lack of a better description (this is what I was told by people within the community), as a company, did now own the data within the game.~~

Hello /r/games. 

Yesterday, as well as a few people telling me about their stories related to SWG.

So below


**What is Star Wars Galaxies?**

Star Wars Galaxies (SWG) was an MMORPG created by Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) and LucasArts (R.I.P.) in 2003. The game was a huge success and even had three expansions created for it:

JTL - [Jump to Light Speed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Galaxies:_Jump_to_Lightspeed) that added a completely new level of game play - open world space combat...think Freelancer

[Rage of the Wookies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Galaxies:_Episode_III_Rage_of_the_Wookiees) - Added a new planet Kashyyyk.

Trials of Obi-Wan. This expansion pack was released just before the New Game Experience (NGE, carried with it some controversy. The expansion added the planet Mustafar and several in-game items, such as the Mustafar player housing bunker.

I would generally consider MMORPGS to be my faouvtire genre and SWG is by far the best one I have ever played. Ask anyone that used to play it pre-CU/NGE and they will be able to tell you stories until you're deaf in the ear

SWG, however, its mechanics also set it aside. A hotbar is used, and quests are given but there are no levels or set classes (per say) within the game. When creating a character one is given the choice of a starting class (Artisan, Marksman, Brawler, Medic, Scout) and is thrown into the game

Quests are handed out through terminals, for example, with other classes, such as an Entertainer, I go to the Entertainer mission terminal, and pick up a mission to go into the cantina and get 10 people to watch me dance. 

It is quite difficult, but a Tl;dr would probably be: No fixed class, level up what you want; no levels are shown; you can combine anything you want. 

**Unlike with other MMOs, not the destination that defines it.** I create my own class, and my own path to the end. I still remember fondly the freinds I met on the way, the exploits of leveling my medic up by sitting at a designated field zone on a battlefield, whereby about 50 feet away, combat between the Rebels and Empire (players) was raging on.

**What are some of its notable features?**

No matter what I talk about in here

* Player cities. The Cities in the game are ALL (besides the main NPC ones) player made (Artisans == Architects create the buildings), city halls, guild halls, shuttleport, class trainers. Cities would hold elections over who would be mayor, and I can remember at times a lot of under hand dealings being done on some of the larger cities on my old SWG server (Bria) so people could become mayor. I can't seem to find the video for love nor money, but it showed a group of Imperial players setting up puppets within a rival city (of a rival guild) to bring it down
* Open guild warfare. When guilds would declare war against each other
* Jedis and Bounty Hunters. The path to Jedi was not an easy one. Seeing a Jedi was one hell of a rare site. I can't 100% remember what it was back on the official servers, and not give you the amount...You get the idea. On the other side, Bounty Hunters were given Bounty Hunter terminals that let them HUNT PLAYER JEDIS/SITH. It was a mini-pvp experience. 
* Everything is player made. Everything. Anything that you see in game can and probably has been created by a player at some point. That armour that you see someone sporting? Player made. That expansive player city? Player made. 
* From /u/Dividan84: I think you should add ""Incredibly amazing community"" under features because seriously SWGEmu's community is one of the greatest I've seen in gaming. When I first started playing I had a helper spend the entire day with me teaching me all about the game
* Expansive Worlds. Each world was

I'll leave it at that

**Why was there a need for an Emulator (Emu)?**

This is a question that I get asked a lot

When the game first came out, as aforementioned above). First we have the Combat Upgrade (CU). The Combat Upgrade was, in most players eyes, a response to the growing popularity of WoW. SWG was perceived as being a hardcore MMO, with it's level of grind and the difficult learning curve that some people experienced, ergo, much of what was there was redone. Although the CU was seen to be a game-killer, it was not the end of the world. It did add levels

The second overhaul that the game through (and it's most controversial and detrimental) was the New Game Experience/Enhancement (NGE). Everything in that game was COMPLETELY overhauled, the Smuggler was now based on Han Solo, and the Medic on some random droid...It's hard to stress enough how much this changed of the game...what made SWG, SWG was taken out to try and appeal to a wider audience. In the end, however, this was what lead to SWGs destruction. I do recognise that the NGE was not the sole reason for SWG's fall. Licensing issues and SW:TOR probably played a small role in the end.

**How do I get into the Emu?**

Everything within the Emu is free. And you can find an installation guide [here](http://www.swgemu.com/forums/content.php?r=179-Install-SWGEmu). Most people use their old physical discs; you can actually buy these online for VERY cheap:

[UK Amazon Link](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Star-Wars-Galaxies-Empire-Divided/dp/B0000694YE/ref=sr_1_sc_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368365865&amp;sr=8-2-spell&amp;keywords=Star+Wars+Galxies).

Those 1 stars are related to the NGE.

Ebay is also a very good place to look. ~~It **MUST BE THE EMPIRE DIVIDED EDITION**. ((SEE ABOVE FOR INFO ON THIS))~~

There are other more...illicit ways of obtaining the game

**I'm in. Where do I start?**

Firstly, if you'd like! I don't have much money, but I'm more than happy to help out: **Soza**. I'm also gathering signatures to start a city, so if you'd like to be apart of that, give me a shout!

Edit: Here are some of my new player tips:

* Start as an Artisan. Even if you don't intended to be one
* Check out the in-game holocron (press alt to bring up your mouse
* Pick your starting city as Coronet on Corellia. It is the most populated. 
* To change the resolution and some other options go to: Computer &gt; Local Disc C: &gt; SWGEmu and double click the swgemu_setup.

**Useful Links**

*[Skill Calculator](http://www.swgcharacterbuilder.com/swg-cb.php): Help plan out the skills that you want to take up.
*[SWG Emu Website](http://www.swgemu.com/forums/index.php): 
The SWG Emu website. 
*[Trainer Locations](http://forum.galaxiesreborn.com/swg-gameplay/swg-pre-cu-trainer-locations-t4068.html): A list of all NPC trainers.

Bare in mind, SWG-EMU is the most popular one. If you're solely looking for a pvp experience, for example, you can give Galaxies Reborn a go. Although, I would highly recommend the swg-emu simply so the player base does not get even more fragmented. Pvp exists on it.

A list of all emulators can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Galaxies#Emulation).

Dear Stardock customer

My name is Brad Wardell. I'm the President &amp; CEO of Stardock.  Two years ago, it just wasn't a very good game.

Elemental was an expensive game. You probably paid $50 or more for it. And you trusted us to deliver to you a good game. $50 is a lot of money and companies have a moral obligation to deliver what they say they're going to deliver and frankly

While we did update Elemental: War of Magic (you can still download v1.4). Its design just wasn't adequate to make it into the kind of game it should be. So we decided to start over. From scratch. We made a new game called Fallen Enchantress.

So even though it's been two years, we believe, lives up to the expectations set for the original Elemental.  This game is yours. Free. It's already been added to your account.

You can download and play it by going to http://download.stardock.com.

We hope you enjoy Fallen Enchantress.  Please feel free to visit the Elemental forum at www.elementalgame.com if you wish to talk to me and the rest of the team. We're there and very interested in your feedback.


Thank you for being our customers and your patience.


Sincerely

Brad Wardell

This post will only discuss the PVE portion of WoW.

Every expansion creates a bigger and bigger pile of useless content and it's an enormous indicator of WoW's old age. It's also a pretty huge issue that mostly goes ignored.

""What's Naxxramas?"" A new player might ask.

""Just some shitty old raid no one cares about."" A veteran player might respond. 

The addition of transmogging

The thought that Ice Crown Citadel, all the artwork, all the voice acting, it's useless now. Edit: **This is an opinion, good lord, calm down.**

I think this unveils one of WoW's biggest flaws, there's really no reason to be there. It almost seems insulting that they still charge money for previous expansions when all you're paying for is to level past those areas.

As more and more expansions are released more and more content is going to become junk

I've already decided that I'm going to take the plunge once again with this expansion and I'm beginning to think it might be the end of the road for my journey in WoW. Judging from the beta and the previews I feel this one is going to hit all the right notes and so quitting when this expansion slows down might be a good way to go. I'd like to leave while things are still fairly good.

However, no one has found any evidence to suggest that Sonic 2 HD stores your keystrokes anywhere, be it locally or remotely. Wireshark analysis confirms it does not access the internet in any capacity. I did confirm that the program does, in fact, respond to keystrokes even if you have another window in focus - say, you alt-tabbed to Chrome or Firefox or whatever. So, for example, each time you press spacebar in Chrome will result in Sonic jumping in the background. Terrifying security flaw, please

As for the registry entries, again, programmer incompetency. While using the registry to store game settings is incredibly dated and discouraged, it's essentially harmless.

Yes, the game's executable is packed and obfuscated to deter reverse engineers. Trojans often utilize the same tactic to hide malicious code. The fact that this compression sets off antivirus software is confirmed by Avira. AntiVir detects the game as ""[TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen](http://www.avira.com/en/support-threats-description/tid/3488/tlang/en)"", whose description reads:

&gt;In order to aggravate detection and reduce size of the file it is packed with a runtime packer.

[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/file/844e6a8728463533aabafb782fd0703614a93afad632f84cd1d40df40fd0a2cd/analysis/), it's not because it is malicious. The programmer, LOst, has a severe case of paranoia and does not want Sonic Retro members to reverse engineer his engine (refer to my editorial for the absurdity and hypocrisy in this).

So, is not in any danger if you played Sonic 2 HD. The game is safe. Any antivirus warnings you get are indeed a false positive.**

Not gonna lie
 -----------------------------------------------

**Is Bioshock Infinite anti-Tea Party?**

*""No. If anything, and that caused writers such as Sinclair Lewis to openly fret about America itself going fascist. Its Christian and Founders-oriented iconography is not meant to reflect the evils of Christianity or the founders, but rather how easily the concepts advanced by Christianity and the Founders can be perverted in the service of authoritarianism.""*


*""[...]In other words


*""it’s [also] easy to see how conservatives might find the game especially distasteful, called “Motorized Patriots,” who recite quasi-Biblical statements of faith.*

*However, their resemblance to George Washington is meant to reflect on the delusion of the people who run the city, who see themselves as latter day Washingtons, not as an attack on Washington himself.""*
 -----------------------------------------------
**Should children play Bioshock Infinite?**

*Absolutely not. The game is rated M

Good on you guy. Doesn't complain that it will corrupt our children or anything.

**Was the game created by Marxists/atheists?**

*""There is no evidence to suggest that the people involved in making Bioshock Infinite held Marxist ideas. In fact
 -----------------------------------------------


So yeah. It's a good thing the was able to grasp that this is more a critique on society than the actual philosophies of such. The only disappointing thing is if you were to scroll down and read the comments. THERE are the people complaining and saying ""I will NOT let my 9 year-old play this!"" and ""More proof that gamers are out of touch morons who take this crap too seriously. Why would an adult spend countless hours on a video game unless you were out of touch. No wonder our Republic is lost..Have fun with your childish hobby the rest of us are busy trying to save our country.""

I guess putting up comments on the internet without reading the context it's linked to isn't a trait of gaming websites.

- The music dropped out and sound effects are missing

- The frame rate is unstable and randomly dips to unacceptable levels.

- The camera is skittish

- A container holding orbs couldn't be opened

- Context sensitive prompts in general are flakey

- Various clipping and animation bugs

Several resets and 2 patch installs have not fixed this. I did some research and apparently this is widespread. The latest patch has caused many people to be locked out of their game completely
