**What you'll need**

* A computer 

* An Origin account

**Step 1**

*(Before doing anything keep in mind that any doughnuts you have right now may be used

* Download [bluestacks here](http://www.bluestacks.com/)

* Download the simpsons tapped out apk from [spAnser here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tappedout/comments/1cgao0/how_to_get_all_the_premuim_items_you_want_taking/c9gf2q4) 

* Install bluestacks using the default settings

* Once bluestacks is done installing

*Note:  Bluestack may ask you to ""auto sync"" or ""1click sync"". You will not need to do so for our goal.* 

**Step 2**

* Launch Simpsons Tapped out from the My apps page ([image](http://i.imgur.com/9Cz6QVb.png))
 * Simpsons will update to the latest version

* Simply login to your origin account and enter your springfield.

**Step 3**

* This part is fairly straightforward. Spend Spend Spend.

* Tap anything you want to buy

* Once you're done shopping Buy yourself a few hundred thousand cash using doughnuts and exit the game using the ""back"" arrow in the bottom left of bluestacks UI

* If you want to bring a limited amount of doughnuts with you back to your device then

 I recommend spamming this until you get the 150 doughnuts reward). As soon as you win the amount of doughnuts you want to keep


Congratulations!

**FAQ**

1.

 Q. I installed BlueStacks and updated simpsons  but when tapping the main splash screen to enter my springfield the App's screen turns black and suddenly im back at BlueStack's homepage. Aka app crashing on startup.

A. A restart of your computer should fix the problem. Try not to have any other programs running when launching Simpsons ( Chrome

2. Q.  

After I buy everything I want using unlimited doughnuts and i'm trying to win doughnuts from the homer buddha to bring back to my device

A. From what I've seen. No. You will still ""spend"" 15 doughnuts on a Homer buddah with each purchase. 

So if you win 30 doughnuts from HomerB,False,self,t5_2v7cj,1367287388.0,,gil,t3_1cgao0

The purpose of the hack appears to be to promote a scam site which claims to offer discount items for your game.

The following conversation occurred on IRC shortly after the hack:

Edit: In the spirit of full disclosure

Edit: More info [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tappedout/comments/1jtgag/fan_site_tstotipscom_has_been_hacked/cbisq45)

Update (2013-08-11): Gamezino has added two new posts to tstotips.com. According to the original authors of the posts, completely without their permission. The authors (mrfy and Rcsprinter) do not endorse Gamezino, and never approved the edits Gamezino made to their posts.

Update (2013-08-11): Recently surfaced photos prove Gamezino is using a hacked version of the game. Photos give step-by-step instructions to Gamezino employees on how to use a hacked version of the game to fill customer orders: http://s1279.photobucket.com/user/Gamezino/library/STEPS

Update (2013-08-19): Gamezino has recently been offering to pay the former writers on tstotips to continue to write for tstotips.

I just had an idea tonight to throw together a place that one could view a whole different bunch of buildings layouts to get inspiration from. It was made pretty quickly so it isn't perfect. I went through a load of posts on imgur from r/tappedout and picked a bunch that look really awesome. As of now I'm kinda running out of space in the nav so I picked what seemed to be the most submitted buildings.

Only after making the bulk of this did I think to see if it existed somewhere else. I checked tstotips and there seems to be a broken gallery page

Oh also you can submit your layout too! Otherwise I'll probably troll imgur

1370413783.0,1fpglv,A warning to all Tapped Out players,Mojo_Jones,53,16,38,"First

Until Sunday. Had to go to a graduation and set the entire town on 4 hour tasks. When I got back, the town itself is the same but my name has changed to something entirely different. 

I tried all the ""fixes"" on EA's website, this is absolutely 100% on EA's side. I've had an open ticket since Sunday but nobody from their tech support has returned any further emails or requests to contact me and let me know wtf is going on. 

The kicker to the story is this.. I tracked down their phone number for customer support (and not on their website, he said some rather enlightening things that I think you all should be aware of. He told me that as it was a ""free"" game, the phone techs couldn't do anything about it only the e-mail techs. I pointed out to him that while that was technically true, EA goes above and beyond to get us to spend money (donuts) left and right in the game.. what if I HAD purchased those donuts from Gil like I had meant to? He then told me that they only had limited resources to bring to bear on the issue.... and I pointed out to him that EA is the largest videogame company in the damn world. If they don't have the resources to attend to paying customers who are locked out, that's pretty piss poor. Finally he told me that it was the developer's issue and that he couldn't do anything about it. 

A quick review of the Tapped Out forums over at EA reveal this to be an issue not unique to me. Other users report the same issues, though I hold out for hope that the Screw Up Fairies will magically visit in the night and un-fuck whatever it is they fucked up. But I wanted to make sure that the rest of the Tapped Out community sees this. I don't expect you to stop playing, hell, if it popped back on for me tonight you can bet I'd be tapping away with the lot of you... but before you spend another dime on donuts, please remember my tale before you fork over real money for a product that EA is willing to take your money for over but not think highly enough to warrant real tech support for.

1369450224.0,1f0e74,How much have YOU given?,heres_the_video_clip,47,7,51,"I was curious about how much money EA is making from this game

EA has made quite a bit of money from TS:TO.
In the month of March 2013 alone it made 10 million in digital revenue.
And since it's launch in August 2012
They purport to have 5.4 million daily active users across both the iOS and Android platform.

Impressive numbers. What's even more impressive is their overpricing.

The normal price for a new video game is usually $59.99.
[(Consider a few PC examples here. Most console games are around the same price)](http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/290410/the-top-10-best-pc-games/1)

Now $60 dollars gets you the full game. Let me repeat that: it gets you the FULL GAME. Yes, they are games in their own right. 

Is TS:TO anywhere near the same graphics
But ok

How many donuts would they have to sell to one person to earn $59.99?

Now, but they certainly make your town look nicer. There are premium buildings, premium characters, and premium decorations. And they make it quite convenient to purchase donuts to buy these premium items. Here's how it breaks down:

Price | Amount of Donuts
:|::|
$1.99|	12
$4.99|	60
$9.99|	132
$19.99|	300
$49.99|	900
$99.99|	2400

Not surprisingly

Why.. it's almost like they're *encouraging* you to buy the most expensive thing.

Now let's take a look at how the premium buildings break down in donut cost:


*BUILDINGS*

Item |                         Donuts
:|::|
Aztec Theater|	80
Duff Brewery|	190
Frink's Lab|	150
Lard Lad Donuts|	110
Springfield Observatory|	75
Springfield Sign|	170
Tire Fire|	40
Volcano Lair|	200
School Bus|	120
Krustylu Studios|	140
Asia de Cuba|	100
Lugash's Gym|	175
Open Air Stage|	160
Sprawl-Mart|	90
Mausoleum|	60
Santa's Village|	200
Mapple Store|	90
Barney's Bowlarama|	250
Try-N-Save|	70
Swanky Fish|	90
Duff Stadium|	90
Springfield Coliseum|	190
Sleep-Eazy Motel|	225
**Total**|	**3065**

Buying donuts at the cheapest per-donut rate, for a total of $150. This gives you 3300 donuts and lets you purchase every premium building that is currently available. 

What about the premium characters in the game?

    
*CHARACTERS*

Item |                         Donuts
:|::|
Hans Moleman|	60
Kearney|	60
Squeaky-voiced teen|	30
The Rich Texan|	85
Fruit-Bat-Man|	90
Blue Funzo|	50
Pink Funzo|	70
Purple Funzo|	60
Santa's Little Helper|	150
Frink's Robot Dog|	60
Leprechaun|	150
Lumpy|	55
**Total**|	**920**

You'd end up spending $49.99 for the 900 pack to buy all those.

This doesn't even include the premium decorations, come out to 1870 donuts. At the cheapest per-donut cost, you'd end up spending another $100 dollars on the 2400 pack.

The grand total for all the premium items currently available in the game comes out to approximately: $300.

That is FIVE times as much as a brand new

Now obviously, you will end up paying more than you think. There are a few reasons for this:

* Most people don't keep track of their in-game purchases. EA knows this - in fact
* The Simpsons is a strong brand. When a new premium item comes out
* Your friends have these items. So naturally
* A big chunk of those 5.4 million daily users are kids. And EA knows that they will get their parents to buy them premium items. And again

So when you see all these people using hacks and cheats
perhaps understanding EA's overpricing will help you understand those individuals a little better. 

They are not out to make a great game that deserves our money.  
They are out to make a DLC-based game that they can milk for as much money as they can by leveraging the Simpsons brand.   
  
And you know what

And they have $50+ million to prove it.",self,t5_2v7cj,False,,skinner,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tappedout/comments/1f0e74/how_much_have_you_given/

**TIPS:**

* House farming is a common strategy (tip). Building a large number of similar houses to gain money and experience. Two types of houses yield the best result: brown houses and blue houses. Brown houses will give you a little money and experience every 3 minutes. Blue will give you more every 8 hours. Recommended size starting at 100; however

* Never trust Gil. *-Scarsdale_Vibe*

* Don't use precious donuts to purchase cash. (Unless

* Remember later in the evening to assign 8-12h jobs. *-Scarsdale_Vibe*

* On the build menu there is an ""I"" (lower case-damn autocorrect) if you click that it opens an options menu. You can turn on confirm doughnut spending. I have lost more than a couple doughnuts tapping to fast and rushing jobs that finish so fast there was no time to cancel. *-Badwaytogo*

* I've pimped out my Springfield with over a thousand houses. Not quite where I want to be yet,000 a day. I refuse to spend cash on this game, so with that in mind, a donut is worth any amount of game cash.
I recently tried every item available in the game, and then sell them to repeat the process. The XP adds up and provides donuts through bonus levels.
Here's what I found: If you have unlimited time and ambition, and repeating, you're paying $4 per 1 XP.
If you value your time in the slightest
As of the update,000. Provided we can keep the 120,000 rate, you're paying 738,000 - 838,000 for 3 donuts (depending on your luck) by buying and selling masses of volleyball nets.
*TLDR: Buying and selling Volleyball Nets is the equivalent to purchasing XP at a rate of 6.15 game dollars. All in all


**TRICKS:**

* Tap Homer ten times to receive ten donuts and the Jebediah Statue *-I_smell_awesome

* When you visit a neighbor you have the opportunity to tap three items for money once every 24 hours. If you make the first tap and leave

 * Another thing about tapping stuff at a neighbor's town

1.	Really enjoyed the length of the event and the number of unlockable items. Liked that there was a combination of new buildings, Xmas, Thanksgiving, etc) 
2.	The Pet Snake was worthless. Just why? What did this add to the game on any level?
3.	Liked seeing the Duff Stadium and Sleep Eazy be the final prizes. All location and character combos are my favorite items/unlocks. 
4.	There is no two ways to put it. The whacking mechanism was a grind. And anytime a game feels like the game is a grind
A.	**Reduce the snake targets by 20-50%.** This means instead of 12500 for the motel
B.	**Whacking the snake should count for 1 snake. Then the drops should be an additional bonus**. Every time you whack a snake, or even 100 more snakes or anywhere between 4-10 eggs.  
C.	**Make the egg drops for friends a basket/box. I.e. anything but more individual eggs**. It took time to gift eggs. Like 4-10 seconds an egg. If we could drop off eggs in increments of dozen
5.	I spent more time playing Tapped Out in the last month than ever before. And I have enjoyed this last month far less than any month prior. The game felt like it was needlessly wasting my time. I don't hack or cheat, but I am going to look back at this experience and wince. 
6.	Why was it even an option to spend donuts on eggs to give to friends? Did anyone need this? 
7.	Does lumpy have a multiplier bonus? For 55 dounts
8.	Why was the Fat Tony/Rich Texan expansion released now? Couldn’t this have  waited until after Whacking Day? 
9. Why was Ninja Homer 120 donuts but Bumblebee man
10. I'd give the ""prizes"" an A- with Tatum and the stadiums being my faves. This excludes the Pet snake

Overall

Xmas was a A- (big pluses from the Snow and the Santa Coin exchange at the end)

Thanksgiving was a D- (Balloons? that's it?)

Halloween was a B (lost points because of the disappearing Candy mishap)

Valentine's Day was a C+ (good decorations

What are everyone else's grades on this and other expansions?

Personally, and people asking questions about bugs or other game-play tips.  I like seeing what other people are doing in the game, and letting people know they don't have to freak out that their town is gone because Origin is down.  I don't like seeing people go on a downvote rampage because they disagree with how someone else decides to play.

EDIT: Yes, let me know. In order to do this for you I'll need your origin login info- this is your email and password.

You won the Springfield Downs jackpot? You got Hans Moleman from a Homer Buddha? Two characters are standing next to each other and it kind of looks like they are interacting in a far-fetched way? Awesome. Just remember that same thing has happened to literally thousands of us already.

1365912338.0,1cb5ca,Disappointed with Whacking Day?,quartern,29,4,33,"With Halloween and Christmas

With Halloween, visiting your friends was a great benefit, and helped you achieve your quest goals more quickly. With Whacking Day, it takes more time to visit friends, as you have to hunt for snakes, and due to losing snakes from your inventory and the difficulty of finding snakes in larger/busier towns, I frequently visit friends and end up with fewer snakes than I started with (my net after visiting friends this afternoon was -50). I've even lost snakes while placing eggs, I'd lost over 50 eggs).

12, it seems next to impossible to even come close in the next month. Only a handful of my friends list have even built Fort Sensible; unless something changes, I'm wondering how many are going to get the Sleep Eazy Motel, and how many are just going to get frustrated. Assuming even distribution of snakes/day (i.e., I don't acquire items that allow me to whack more snakes/day), I know I'm about 500 snakes behind where I need to be to get to 12,500 before the end of this event.

Edit: forgot to mention that Whacking Day feels a lot more like grinding, and the number you need to get the Sleep Eazy, it seems you almost need to play the game every two hours.

Collecting from a business or home will give you money and exp and for the town Owner it will re-set the timer on that building. 


Homes and businesses have set timers for how long it takes to be ready again


The best thing to do when visiting is to spray paint a building. The buildings that can be vandalized give no tax money and have no timers


Thusly, there is no reason for you to collect from these, **the exception being to revive someone's wilted crops**, which is always a nice guy thing to do.


The next best things to collect from are the long-timer buildings, so unless the Owner comes back in the next 237 seconds, you aren't really helping them very much. Buildings with longer times are a better bet.


A good reason to not collect from houses at all is that if someone has 4 blue houses, but for someone with a house farm it can really muck up their money system, especially of more than one friend does this.


If you have a lot of friends (because you put your Origin name as your Reddit flair, Side Show Bob is not always announced! So you might find him while looking for Spray Cans. Catching Bob is part of raising your ****Righteousness Rating.***


Another option is to have your town organized in such a way as to leave the buildings you most like collected from in the middle of the start screen. It is quite possible to do this while still having a nice town layout.



After all that snake non-sense it has occurred to me that we may need an easy way of communicating with each other. I personally am way too lazy to see something in a town



How about the Statue we can all get for free from Homer? Everyone can have the statue, frontward, and left or right side of the house can mean certain things. ( I need more eggs = statue in the front yard ) this could potentially also be used to indicate long abscesses. I tend to remove friends if they have been inactive for more than a week or so. If you are just going on vacation or need study time for a while but you will be returning the Statue can be placed in such a away as to let friends know that you'll be back to playing again in a while.

1369017677.0,1eo5na,An idea for a task or a side-quest.,OSUTechie,25,5,11,"On of my favorite episodes is [""Last Exit to Springfield""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Exit_to_Springfield). In that episode Homer becomes president of the Power Planet Union. At one point Lisa is playing a [""folk style"" song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAacb31bltI) while the workers are on strike. 

Here is my idea. 

Since we are starting to see tasks that require other free members (Fat Tony/Burns, I think they could introduce a task that involves Burns/Smithers? and Carl/Lenny/Homer/Lisa. 

* Carl has the task in his options
* Homer/Carl/Lenny holds picket signs outside the main planet building
* Lisa plays her guitar
* Burns and maybe Smithers are inside the building (These two can be omited).
* Be a two-three day task

If they really want

* [New Building] Build ""Painless Dentistry""
* Make Lenny
* Once Burns finished
* Make Burns ""Fire Random Employees (45s)""
* [New Task] Make Lisa go for a ""Teeth Cleaning (30m)"" 
* Marge informs Homer Lisa needs braces.
* Make Lenny
*  Dialog between Lenny
* [New Task] Make Burns and Homer have dinner together(60m). Requires Burn's Mansion.
* Dialog between Lenny
* [New Task] ""Make Carl
* Dialog between Burns and Smithers
*  Make Lisa go for a ""Teeth Cleaning (30m)"" 
**End Quest**

After the story line ends

Painless Dentistry associated task for Springfield Citizens.
 
* ""Teeth Cleaning"" - 30m Bart, Millhouse, Martin.

1. You can make Homer and Lisa clean up the peices of houses and nucluer waste by telling them to clean up springfeild. I know this is in the tutorial

2. If you accidently send someone to do a job in a building

3. Don't waste your donuts on the Homer Bhudda. It has never give me anything better that 20 donuts

4. Make sure to check your conformity meter. It can help you make your Springfield better and give you a ""Conformity Bonus"". This will give you up to 5% more money and make your Springfield look better, clean other peoples graffiti and ask your friends to vandalize your town so you can clean it up. I also heard that sending Snake and Fat Tony to jail will work, but I'm not entirely sure on that one.

5. Sending someone to do a job for 24 hours will give you less money than sending someone to a 1 hour job 24 times. Check back often to send your Springfielders to do more 1 hour tasks!

6. Tap Homer 10 times in a row to get 10 free donuts and a Jebidiah Springfeild Statue.

7. People only walk on roads

8. Building more houses is a great way to get more money and XP. 

9. You can visit a friends town every 24 hours and get money and XP from their houses. And you don't have to do all of them at once, and there will only be 20:00 hours left. This is useful during the holidays when special currency is used and you can get the currency from friends. Thanks to twinn47 for that one!

10. Speaking of holidays
That's it! Please post yours in the comments and good luck.",self,t5_2v7cj,1363913193.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tappedout/comments/11j7mz/tips_and_tricks/

That got us wondering if an entire building could be added to the game

Change the pavement from slate to brown/tan to provide a dirt road section for wooded areas

Change the pavement/road to red and add a brick pattern 

Change the color of both limos to add some variety

Change the color of the non-character based houses so, blue one, etc.

The ideas could be endless and could allow for even more ingenious city designs.

A friend of mine had this problem and had to reinstall the game to fix it, it looks like Origin is having more widespread login problems. I was going to log in to EA's help and file a bug report, but I can't even do that! I can't reset my password or log into my other EA games, like Scrabble.

So I'm waiting until that gets resolved until I try to reinstall the game. I'm hoping that I don't lose anything I do in the meantime, since I've heard some people have had that problem.

Random details on my playing:

- I started in October during the Hallowe'en update
- Im currently Level 26. About halfway through. I log on at least once a day.
- I'm as far as getting the Burns Manor
- I have grown corn once. Not really a thing to do with not buying/hacking donuts
- I occasionally visit friends. Mostly because it is a tedious task. Although if I had been doing this i'm sure i'd be a lot further than I am.
- I've yet to experience the harp of doom. I do experience rip cord Bart a lot sometimes though (shitty NZ internet).
- I don't farm houses. I have a few duplicates to make my streets look better


My donut details:


- Christmas was admittedly awesome since I received about 30 donuts when trading in Santa Coins. I only ever got 1 reindeer
- The height of my donuts was about 75


I never used the hack because I thought it would make the game far too easy. I'm contemplating buying in-game so I can afford to expand my land. I recently started remodelling and have now run out of room (oops)
Saying that last sentence is odd


SO - **What are the details of your playing?** I'm curious to see where we all stand.

- When did you start?
- What level are you up to?
- How often do you log in?
- What major quest was your last?
- Have you purchased any donuts? How many? What did you buy?
- Have you used the donut hack? How many? What did you buy?
- If you haven't purchased/hacked donuts
- Do you visit friends daily? 
- Other details and potential braggery?


Cheers guys! Sorry if this is stupid but i'm genuinely interested. One of the reasons why I love this game is because of the many ways players can go about it.

This morning I unlocked shirtless Groundskeeper Willie which means I have 5

I've not used any donuts so I only have the one snake rock but I do have a full compliment of friends with towns I can go whacking in (sadly a few had their towns deleted and have given up on the game but snakes still appear) - assuming a 50/50 egg to snake ratio that means a maximum of 250 snakes per day if I hunt down every single one. If I combine that with all the snake-generating tasks and the roughly 50ish eggs I get from friends every day I'm not convinced I'll make it. Does Shirtless Willie produce eggs at all or is he like Gymnast Lisa? (I can't find out as I unlocked him while Willie was busy injecting snake poison).

Play a horse race.
As it it is going, let your scratched ticket sit there. 

Others have stated you have to time it right, as soon as the race ends your scratched ticket goes blank and you can do it again. Timing doesn't matter beyond finishing the scratch off first and waiting.

Then, example, today I had 5 when I did it, lost 3, now have 2, and things tell me I don't have enough. By having 2 or less, when it takes 3 you go negative. As long as it goes negative you are fine.

What do we hope for/ expect from the next Halloween Update - which I assume will be the next major update?

I think a Bart Hugo costume might be good. Kudos would also be great. And a Freddy Groundskeeper Willie costume. ",self,t5_2v7cj,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tappedout/comments/1kf2v3/expectations_and_predictions_for_next_halloween/

With Krustlyland near finished (for those that used Donuts to speed through) it fills in a decent amount of the top part. But Squidport leaves a ton of extra space to the south. It looks like they may be planning either more Squidport or another expansion that would fill in that lower area. Or am I just crazy?
