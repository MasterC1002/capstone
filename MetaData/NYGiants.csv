When we drafted him

Now, but know that we are truly blessed with one of the best quarterbacks to have ever played the game. It doesn't bother me that he doesn't get the recognition he deserves, in fact I love it. I love it because 10 years from now he will go down in history, and people will realize he is perhaps the best late game quarterback to ever play the game. 

It is similar to an acceptance of faith. I feel reassured knowing that whomever plays in our offensive line

Eli has a way of picking apart defenses that few quarterbacks can replicate. I grin every time I hear ""Omaha"" or ""55's got the mic"" knowing that he's calling front line coverage to defend the blitz. And on the off chance he does get sacked, and makes it seem like it never happened once he takes the next play's snap. Whether it was ""3rd and Smith"" of a few years ago, or now simply ""Cruuuuuuuuuuz"" he is as good at using his slot receiver to get a 3rd down conversion as any quarterback in history. Furthermore, I love the playcalling this season with all of the 4th down attempts, and would never trust another quarterback with as many as he has made.

Finally, down by almost any amount of points, and still have a legitimate chance of winning. Eli has the best two minute drill in the game. His no-huddle offense is only rivaled by his older brother, but in those last two minutes, Peyton's numbers don't even come close. Years from now, his picture will reside by Webster's definition of ""clutch.""

1357736678.0,168vs6,IAmA lonely German Giants fan. ,Cobarith,131,8,44,"Hello everyone.
I am a German guy, you in this reddit are really my only connection to other Giants fans. I've been reading along here long before finally registering, so thank you for that to begin with.
Now that I'm sitting at home being sick I thought I'd tell you my little story before starting to ask question(s).

After visiting the west coast on a trip my godmother gave me as a present for finishing school in 2010, instead thought what the hell and got two tickets for section 117, row 17 for $75 each, instead of just paying like $30 total and sitting somewhere up in the air, having to buy binoculars before the game.

Well, afraid to get lost changing trains or something. To fit in, I got a Bavaro shirt at the merchandise, having no idea who that guy actually was... Something like two hours before kickoff we found our seats and took some pictures, later we got a hot dog and something to drink in one of those fancy cups with all the game dates printed on, and then we enjoyed the game.

While my girlfriend really had no idea about the game at all, and that the quarterback was the leader because he always was the cool guy in those trashy high school movies they air in Germany when they really expect not a single person to be watching TV right then. Still, we both thought the experience was worth every buck I paid. To us the crowd was fantastic, cheering at every pretty pass or nice tackle (you may think that in German soccer stadiums they're singing all day long, but that's stereotype as well – the average fan there only moves when they score a goal, if at all). My jetlag was gone for those hours of highly entertaining sports, I was really amazed.

Now after staying through Irene with my family in Jersey I got back home and yet had to leave for university again. I had no internet connection in my flat there, and be gone when the download finished. Especially when it came down to those famous 4th quarter comebacks, I ran around my room wearing my Bavaro shirt, screaming at my laptop, to the point that my neighbors asked me if everything was alright (seriously). During the week I studied online guides to understanding all the rules, the different positions, play designs, and not on my law stuff.

For christmas, so I had a chance to go insane on that winner-take-all game against Dallas wearing a Giants scarf with my Bavaro shirt and drinking beer from a Giants cooling mug. I was home now and could watch it on a online livestream on my TV in the middle of the night. Great thing. Since the working part of my integrated degree program now started, I then had to take three Mondays off work starting with the Divisional Round Game, which of course was worth it, especially on that morning of February 6th (timeszones, man ...).
I could not sit down for just a minute of that Super Bowl. I was running around my place all night. It was awesome :D

Now my second season as a Giants fan is over and I'm still not tired of it, alone because no one shares my passion, and going to work as a complete wreck monday morning. It's just awesome.

Now, since that would be one of my lifetime dreams as well (I'm saying ""at least once"" for the unprobable case I would not be able to see the Giants play at the mentioned Super Bowl). Yeah, I know the ticket prices are crazy, and getting one from Germany seems not that easy to begin with, but I really just wanted to ask when and how those tickets are distributed that, according to nfl.com, are given to the participating teams. And can you legally buy a ticket from another person at all? Can you give me any further advice?
And really just thank you for any kind of answer. I've never been talking to another Giants fan before :(

Basically, Bradshaw, Black Unicorn and Canty. Potentially Cruz, but I'll get to that. Tynes too, but kickers are kickers.

To replace KP

Bradshaw was a tough loss because I loved the kid, we had one of the youngest and fastest potential stars in the league sitting at the bottom of the depth chart last season. Time to shine, David Wilson.

Black Unicorn was a great Giant for a year. Go watch 1 Brandon Myers game and tell me you'll miss Martellus. Can Myers block as well? Maybe not

Osi and Canty were great but it was time to move on. Osi had been an off-season nightmare for years

I'll mention Cruz, if not more, as Welker and Amendola    **AND**   give up a 1st round pick. Even for Cruz, that's a steep price. (and probably why no one has picked up a 1st round tender since Laveranues Coles).

The bottom line on Cruz is this: If Eli wants to keep him around next year


In addition to those gaps being filled, but he isn't the caliber I'm looking for), and also got Louis Murphy, who could be starting somewhere as a #2 guy, for next to nothing.

Finally

Going into the draft, but maybe that's just me.

I went into our lunch room

my goal is to put up a new (or several pics) each day. I just downloaded about 30 Giants and Eli pics

**UPDATE 1  - 4:00 pm 02-01-12**

**UPDATE 2, and one of the helmet catch...someone drew a head stone that says ""RIP"" over the NY logo, which i thought was hilarious.

i'll be putting up a lot of them tomorrow

**Update 3, this one guy found out it was me putting up the pics so he started raggin g on me, i went to his machine when he was on lunch and put [THESE](http://i.imgur.com/DEPQM.jpg) up. He wasnt happy when he got back to his machine. I peeked in the door and gave the troll smile, he flipped me off. :)

**Update 4, I was really surprised at the uneasiness putting up pics in a 98% pats fan facility caused. all kinds of people were talking  about it, and talking about me
final pics i'll post

I loved how you mastered the art of the strip sack. And I'll never forget being at the Eagles game where you made Winston Justice look like a JV scrub and set the record for sacks in a game.

Twas the night before football

Tony Romo was stirring

Dez Bryant's mother was hiding with care

his body guards watching him

Old Jerry was nestled all snug in his bed

When out on the lawn arose such a clatter

Away sprinted Romo to the left in a dash

All this left Jerry wiping tears with his cash.

Let's show them that not only are the Giants one of the classiest franchises, but they also have one of the classiest fan bases. To accomplish this, let come up with a simply motto to keep us on track. That motto is ""Don't be a dick"". Don't rub the win in. Don't excessively post about how awesome our flair is. Don't post ""Eli is Elite"" comments, everyone have their own opinions, but I'll tell you what, I only see two rings on Drew Brees fingers, so I would like not only the Giants

I think we all experience this while following the Giants--that desire to be respected by the national fans and media, you get defensive and feel dissed.

However, this team clearly plays better when they feel they are the underdog, that's what Coughlin thrives on (which goes to show just how emotional a game football really is, but i digress).

I think all of this stems from the fact that the Giants are never dominant

We know we have the absolute perfect quarterback and coach for this team

1324311193.0,nilcl,"This was going to be a reply to a comment, but it got out of hand.  Coughlin and company, my take.",ProbablyJustArguing,43,43

I'll say this.

1.  Is it Coughlin's fault that Hicks dropped that touchdown?
2.  Is it Coughlin's fault that Eli threw two really underthown passes that got picked?
3.  Is it Coughlin's fault that Manningham didn't run the fade on that pick in the endzone?
4.  Is it Coughlin's fault that Cruz dropped that touchdown?
5.  Did Coughlin get called for holding on the Touchdown that got called back?
6.  Did Coughlin rough the passer?
7.  Did Coughlin make 3 false starts?

The answer is no.  Those players did that.  No amount of motivation is going to fix that.  They were all in position to make plays, there's that.

But Coughlin is the head coach and his record in Nov/Dec is what it is and I think speaks for itself.

There are some things about some pieces that I KNOW how I feel about

**Fewell:**

Now, but we can't run that defense.  Bend but don't break?  No thanks.  Nobody is aggressive, they don't know how to run it, they don't know what they're doing, we don't have the horses for it, and it's a bad idea for a defense in the first place.  When I heard that we were going to be running a modified Tampa 2, I knew this was going to be our future.  It's so hard to watch a defense that is designed to give up 5-7 yard passes all day, despite not being able to get pressure at all this year with 4.  Third and 17 and we rush three?  Really?  Is that Giants football?  For those of you not paying attention, and the defensive playcalling is worse. Perry needs to go

**Aaron Ross**:  You can go eat a bag of dicks.  You just plain can't play.  I wanted you to be great, you get one more full year, before your bag of dicks)

**Antrel Rolle:**  You want to fire up the team

**Ballard:**  I want to root for you,000 for a PSL and $200/game for a fucking seat, and you can watch me every day.  Fuck you.  (For those who don't follow him, this tweat after the game ""I want to go to the jobs of some of the people that talk shit to me on twitter.” agreed.."")

**OSI:**  Where are you buddy?  What's the matter with your body?  How can you have made all that contract noise over the summer and just sit for the majority of the year.  This will be two years you've missed more games than you've played.  So, you've only played 4 years of it.  You've only had 3 years where you've played more than 15 games.  Now, how can you possibly argue you're underpaid.  The games you've played this year, I think we all wish you didn't.  Ugh.  Where are you?  What happened to you?

**Entire Offensive Line**:  Offensive indeed.  What else to say?

**Eli:**  These are the games where you prove to everyone why you're not deserving to be in the conversation.  You can't have these games anymore.  Particularly when it counts.  I let you go on the Seahawks game, line and running backs didn't help you out, but still, you threw 4 picks.  Two of them were really poorly underthown balls.

**JPP:**  I'm kinda down with you, but let's take it easy.  You've got to earn it, and you're on your way, but seriously, so was Osi.  

**Kevin Gilbride:**  It doesn't matter what you called yesterday, and boring offense from the 1970s, I have nothing to say about you that has not been said.  Ten points.  7 in garbage time.  Good game plan.

**Finally

**Number one:** I think you're loyal to a fault.  I think you're loyal to your staff and they don't deserve it.  I don't think you know how to evolve fast enough.  Your OC, but do you think any of it could be strength and conditioning?  Is it me, or can the fact that your teams suck at the end of the year have anything to do with how they condition themselves.  I've never seen a Giants team look so tired as I have this year.  Maybe last year.   Also, anybody with a bump or bruise seems to be missing practice.  How can you play if you don't practice.  Maybe your practices are so terrible that nobody wants to participate.  Perhaps that's a reason why we've always got 10 guys on the injury report.  (this has been consistent throughout your tenure here)  Perhaps it's worth looking at how you practice and try and find out why everyone thinks it's ok to miss practice all week, and only show up on Sundays.

**Number two:**  I think you're stubborn to a fault.  I think you're too rigid in your expectations of your team and how they conduct themselves without being able to back it up with results.  The players don't like you and it doesn't seem like they want to play for you.  I respect how you run the team, or a defensive mind.  You're a good head coach, but I don't think the players respect you like they respect people like Belichick, Parcels, Ryan, or guys like that.  Since that's the case, I don't think the hard ass route is working for you

Playoffs?  Who cares?  I'd rather not listen to Aikman/Collinsworth/whoever tell me how disappointing my team has been for another four hours.  I'm cool to stay home this year at this point.  I've seen nothing in any of our games to lead me to believe that we can win anything.  The defense sucks.  In the games that we've won

And you know what?  The Fucking **EAGLES** are going to win the division.  The Eagles.  We all know that's happening right?  The Eagles.  

Yeah

 1. Giants

 2. Redskins

 3. Fuck that team

 4. Fuck that team

 5. Fuck Michael Vick

**Runningbacks**

What a performance, AB44. While the injury to D'Qwell Jackson certainly cut down the Browns run defense, Bradshaw took advantage of his opportunities and rushed for a career high. Also, welcome to the NFL, David Wilson. On that one 40 yard run, we saw the speed and explosiveness that we drafted him for. He may have put himself in the doghouse, but he's working his ass off to get out of there. One key thing to note on almost all of Bradshaw's big runs and Wilson's 40 yard run - Hynoski had the key block on all of them. If you go back and watch the highlights, sometimes even leaping

**Wide Receivers/Tight Ends**

/u/tootie first brought this up - Rueben Randle came close to being the 5th Giants WR to get to 100 yards this year with 82. God bless Ernie Accorsi. Despite injuries, have all stepped up in the absence of Hakeem Nicks. Sure, that's more credit to Eli, but these guys have made plays when we needed them to. And Cruz, beautiful Victor Cruz, despite being double teamed all game, rose to the occasion and caught 3 TDs. Martellus Bennett is so much better than advertised. He got injured with a hyper extended knee, Dallas fans?

**Offensive line**

In the last two weeks, the Giants have been one of the best pass blocking teams in the NFL, and as they gel more, should be a force in the running game too. Beatty has been a revelation, and he followed his decent 2011 performance with a phenomenal 2012 start to the season. And FFS Coughlin, please don't put Diehl back into the starting lineup when he returns. 

**Defense**

This might be slightly controversial: I don't think the defense is as bad as us fans and the media make it out to be. Yes, faced mobile quarterbacks who managed to escape sacks. In Week 5, they faced off against a pocket QB, but the bigger threat was clearly the runningback. Therefore, they were less aggressive this week. Is the apparent lack of pass rush a problem? Maybe. I would say that opponents have left more blockers to counter the Giants D-line. Combine that with the fact that the Giants DT depth is lacking due to injuries, I would say that I'm not worried about the pass rush, yet. When Canty and Rocky return

One thing the defense *has* done well is defend the run. No, Markus Kuhn had to be the starting DT, and Marvin Austin was asked to be a significant contributor. MEME alert: If you ask Marvin Austin to play significant snaps, you're gonna have a bad time. Other than the 2nd half performances against the Cowboys and Eagles, the Giants have done very well in defending the run. 

This brings to my next point - I think that the main culprit in the bad showing by the defense is the unit least affected by injuries - the LB corp. Micheal Boley is slightly nicked up, he makes big plays, but he misses tackles, gets easily dominated on blocks, and really has been a non-factor everywhere but when rushing the passer. The linebackers as a unit have 11 missed tackles, 6 of them by Chase.

It's really unfortunate that Will Hill got suspended for four games. He has looked impressive in the few snaps he's played, he recovered and played pretty well for the rest of the game. Webster had a decent game, probably a rarity. But the real star of the show is Mr. Prince Amukamara. As some of you have noted, Prince has been really quiet the last few weeks. No big plays given up, barely even noticed in TV coverage. Isn't the old adage that some CBs cover so well that QBs rarely throw at them? PFF has an interesting stat that analyzes cornerbacks, where the total number of snaps a player is in coverage is divided by the number of receptions he gives up. Some of the top 15 (with at least 100 snaps), in descending order: Charles Tillman, Brandon Browner, Brandon Carr, even for such a small sample size. 

In conclusion, but neither do the turnovers. The Bucs were spotted 21 easy points by the Giants offense. Fumble by Bradshaw and (illegitimate) interception by Eli also the Giants defense with short field position against the Browns. Without those easy points, the Giants defense has allowed 24, 14, 7, 19, 20. Certainly not bad. More stats:

* The Giants only allow 18.2 first downs per game

* The Giants force opponents to 10.6 3rd downs per game, 7th in the NFL. 

* Here's a bad stat: the Giants have given up 21 20+ yard pass plays,,False,,t5_2ruqw,False,,True

1366984426.0,1d5ix5,Oh those short arms and those low draft ratings (projecting rds 2 or 3),mightygiants,35,2,18,"It seems there are two big knocks against Pugh by fans who are less than happy with the Giants first round pick.  Now I will admit I would have loved the Giants to have drafted a RT who had been raved about by all the draft people (experts and pretenders alike).  Still I have to consider the scouting process and how most draft publications do their work.  

The Giants would have had scouts looking at and evaluating Pugh throughout the season.  These scouts would judge his talent

Clearly the Giants didn't ignore this measurable that would be defined as an outlier measurement and an indicator that Pugh could fail at the next level.   The Giants did what I suspect not many did.  They went back (including Jerry Reese

Ever since ""can't miss OLT prospect"" Gallery washed out as an OLT for the Raiders the arm length measure has taken on new level of importance.     Gallery was a highly touted prospect who was drafted the year the Giants traded for Eli Manning.  The book on him was as impressive as the book on the two OLTs drafted Thursday night.   Unfortunately Gallery went to the Raiders who were a poorly run organization that did not effectively develop their talent.   Gallery was a bust at OLT and OK at ORT and eventually became a Pro Bowl caliber guard. 
All the draft experts who thought Gallery was a can't miss prospect were baffled.    Most didn't bother to consider the Raiders coaching staff and organization.  Almost all of them decided it was his arms

Still someone forgot to tell guys like  left tackles Joe Thomas (32 1/2"") and Jake Long (32 7/8"")  that you can't play in the NFL with short arms.    Someone also forgot to tell Sean Locklear that his 31 3/8 inch arms would prevent him from playing RT at the NFL level.

I am not going to suggest arm length isn't helpful and that longer isn't better (although some studies show that length has a diminishing return and that above average arm length doesn't impart an advantage).    Still it's just a measurement


Now as to his rating by the draft experts.  How many of them do you think did extensive study on Pugh's work at Syracuse?   How many of you think that these draft experts when back and studied film after his arms were measured at 32 inches?  Is it possible many might have considered him first round talent and when the arms were measure simply knocked a round or two off his grade?   

Pugh (with the minor exception of his arms) is nearly the model of what the Giants want in their offensive linemen.   Giants love linemen who are versatile and can play multiple positions.  Giants love smart linemen with mean streaks.   Giants love linemen who are light on their feet and can pull and get to the next level.   Pugh is everything the Giants look for in their linemen.   The fact that he was a finished product who could start sooner rather than later was the point that sealed the deal.

Some personal notes about Sunday's game against the Steelers.

**Offense**

Where do I begin? 

* This offense has been underperforming

* I know we love our Eli

* Our receivers are also to blame, the chemistry is fading between them. 

* The run game is abysmal

**Defense**

* Despite the loss

* The Steelers owned the clock for the second half

* The secondary remains a problem

**Special Teams**

Tynes and Weatherford continue to bailout our offense, but the fact that he had to is sickening.

**tl;d**


* Offense - Bad

* Defense - Getting Better

* Special teams - Inconsistant as hell

**Silver-lining/moving forward**

* Our terrible playing finally caught up to us

* Our next two games are away

* The 'boy and the 'skins lost
first.

* The NFC East has only had 4 division games

**Parting Words**

If we keep playing the way we are, but we have the tallent and resources to be a huge threat, the G-men just need to be kicked into gear. And most importantly, at least we're not the Jets.

Is good Eli-bad Eli back? I've been saying it all year, and Eli doesn't notice Rodgers-Cromartie just sitting in a zone. He lobs the ball up anyway, and DRC makes the easy interception. That's a forgivable mistake, but he made a similar error in the Bucs game on an in-route to Marty B that led to an INT. Cruz also had a quick out route where Manning didn't see the defender sitting in a zone, and he was intercepted. 

There were other egregious mistakes

**Pass Blocking**

Started off awful

**Run Blocking**

Ugh. Can't put too much blame on Brown or Bradshaw

**Receiving**

Hixon and Barden had decent games in relief of Hakeem Nicks, evident on the dropped interception in the endzone where Hixon was out of position because of a rookie. Barden also doesn't play to his size, so he was easily man handled by press coverage. Cruz will cruise. Marty B was taken out the game by the Eagles defense.

**Kenny Philips**

Lesean McCoy first half stats - 2 yards

Mike Vick first half stats - less than 100 yards

*Kenny Phillips gets injured*

Lesean McCoy - 123 yards

Mike Vick - 241 yards

I've said it before and I'll say it again. Kenny Phillips is the 3rd most important player on the Giants after Eli Manning and Jason Pierre-Paul. We better hope his injury is minor, it's cutback and go. There's no stopping that.

1353341754.0,13gear,If we're to win the division...it's going to be an interesting few weeks...,ProbablyJustArguing,29,4,15,"So

Dallas is the only competition I think.  They've got two against the Skins, Saints and Eagles.  I think they split with the skins, beat the eagles, beat the Bengals and split the Steelers/Saints.  That's 9 wins.  

For us to get 9 wins, Packers or Falcons.  The Falcons can wrap up the division in the next 10 days.  If they beat the Bucs and then the Saints, they clinch the division before our game, which maybe means you don't get 100% from them.  The Packers are fighting for their division and they're on a bit of a roll at the moment, so that's going to be a tough one.  The Ravens...who knows what you're going to get from them.  They're like we are at the moment.  But at least they DO hold a two game lead in their division with Ben out for a few weeks minimum.  It's fairly likely that between now and our game with the Ravens that they'll have their division wrapped up and might start resting guys.

Anyways

But really, it's going to be a hell of a few weeks because it'll mean that we have beaten some good teams.  There aren't enough bad teams on our schedule to beat up on to get to 9 wins, so we'll need to beat some playoff teams on our way. (unless Dallas just shits the bed a few times)

I'm nervous.  I'm always nervous.  I don't like our schedule, and none of us are going to have any fingernails come January.

1352732855.0,132bzy,The All-22 Review,ProbablyJustArguing,27,4,15,"I just finished watching the Giants vs Steelers and Giants vs Redskins games coaches film.  (BTW

Anyways, it's clear that Eli is struggling going through his progressions.  And it's not necessarily just him and his receivers not being on the same page, although there is a good deal of that too.  I've seen a pretty good number of really open reads that he's completely missed while trying to force the ball to Cruz and Nicks.  In the Steeler game in particular, they were bringing their corners in to cover the run and those guys were cheating.  There were three plays in particular where the corner cheated on the run and left the #3 WR completely un covered.  If Eli had seen it, they'd all have been touchdowns.  I'm wondering if he feels like he's getting rushed and because of it, making really quick decisions trusting that the receivers will figure out a way to make plays.  I think that the pass blocking hasn't been really terrible so far this year, so I'm wondering why he's throwing so much into double coverage when he's got his third read so wide open.  (granted, but still)

Anyways, since they're a whole lot smarter than I am, I'm sure they'll see that he just isn't always progressing all the way through his reads.  I think they need to figure out how to flip the order of the reads until Nicks is 100%.  They're doubling Cruz and leaving a safety to roll to Nicks if he goes long, so those are going to be double coverage for the time being.  They are going to need to leverage the #3 read more.  It's time for Barden to step up into that role, with Hixon being hurt.  Either Barden or Randel, one.

Also, they'll see that on the self scouting film too and do something about it.

So, and you don't need to watch the coach's film to see that.  I'm sorry David, but your time has come. It's time to ride the pine and being more of a coach for the younger guys, because you're not blocking well at all.

I haven't seen the Bengals tape yet, I'll do it and provide some examples later on in the week, when the coach's film gets released for this game.


EDIT:  Also, was a sure touchdown if Eli had been able to hit him in stride.  Sometimes, his under thrown balls are because he's got to hurry up and get the ball out, but mostly it's just been bad throws from his back foot.  (Hi, 2004 called)",,False,t5_2ruqw,True

1347902609.0,1014mx,Monday Morning Perspective,,26,3,17,"* Yes, the Giants defense was able to hold the Buccaneers to 3 points. While Eli was brilliant in the 2nd half

* What sparked the return of the run game yesterday? Was it just Andre Brown getting a chance, David Diehl's injury was the turning point of the game. As soon as he left, the blocking around Eli got a lot better, and the holes began opening up for the running game. We won't know how Bradshaw or Wilson might have done with such holes, but the truth is that Andre Brown got openings and he took advantage of them. Good for him, and hopefully, he starts against Carolina.

* Victor Cruz and Hakeem Nicks. JR

* Looks like the Cowboys were half right about Martellus Bennett. Not as reliable as Jake Ballard, he came through. So for that, I applaud him. Suck it, Cowboys.

* Best pass rush in the league? I haven't seen it. Other than Mr. Pierre Paul, Justin Tuck? Where are you, Osi Umenyiora? What's supposed to be a strength of this team is looking like a detriment, as Josh Freeman had ample time in the pocket to constantly find receivers. There's no point bemoaning bad cornerback play when the line doesn't help them out at all. 

* However, for the offense, but exciting for the defense.

* Never put Justin Tryon into the game when trying to hold a lead in the fourth. He allowed multiple catches, he's gone for a TD. Also, I don't want to hear that Corey Webster is ""a top 10 CB"" from Giants fans anymore. How he has played the last two games is not how a top 10 CB should play. Coe, Hosley etc were alright, and what I would expect from a backup and a rookie. 

* Unsurprisingly, Giants safety stops a potential TD. The CBs were not getting much help from the pass rush, but they have to perform much better in one on one situations, instead of rolling over and allowing easy catches for Mike Williams and Vincent Jackson.
