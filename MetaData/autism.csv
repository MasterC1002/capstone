1343584614.0,xckwv,Autistic girl video inspired me to ask you about something I've struggled with my whole life: massive over abundance of sensory input,autismish,420,50,372,"Hi /r/autism. I'm a guy in my 30s and I've been struggling with a problem my whole life. I hope I don't offend anyone with this post

I never would have thought about autism until I watched the video about the severely autistic girl who was communicating through the computer

All of my life I've struggled with this characteristic. I've always referred to it as trying to drink from a raging river, I know my own heartbeat and can hear it constantly thumping, every conversation and sound around me is competing for my attention, I have a very complex sense of taste (which is awesome at least) and my sense of smell is ridiculous (like I found out one day that it is not normal to know who is pooping in the restroom with you at the office by the smell and women don't like it that you know when you know without being told that they're menstruating). I have very vivid sight and often see things that others don't, or long before they do (like a car coming to do something stupid, or some shady guys acting shady).  I got teary the first time I watched Limitless because it seemed like someone understood what I go through (I even get those horrible bouts of blackouts with missing time if I don't eat and keep up with sleep) even though it was portrayed positively in that movie. Sadly, I have such a monster rush of information I can't do most of the tricks with it that he can. 

Secondly, but I still struggle a lot). I am incredibly empathic, often to a debilitating degree. 

It often takes an immense amount of concentration for me just to filter out the useless information I am flooded with, I'll look at someone or someones and it's like my brain downloads this massive dump of perfectly captured information about the situation. Like ten thousand times more detailed and vivid than usually just glancing around. But it's not all sensory (like although I can picture it perfectly, I couldn't describe people's clothing) it's more like a complete snapshot of the universe, this massive sensory and empathic input, like I could sit and describe exactly how this person is. Sometimes it feels so intense I feel like I *am* that person for a few seconds after, like the only thing separating me from them is this thin veneer of our brains. The memory and effects lasts for hours and is super distracting. 

I also have a crazy gift for remembering the faces and body language of everyone I meet

I've read about autism and I don't seem to have any other characteristics, I can relate to people (too much sometimes), I don't have trouble picking out focal clues, etc. That's why I'm coming to you because like I said this is the first time I've had hope in years.

Because I'll be honest, like a pill or a technique, because I've been completely on my own about this my whole life. Alcohol is the only thing that helps, but it gives me terrible tunnel ""vision"" and I generally find it unpleasant to be drunk. (The ironic possibility that this tunnel vision is more like ""normal"" people has not been lost on me.)

Sorry that this is long and rambley, does this sound like something like autism, and does anyone have any suggestions for what I can do? Like more reading, resources, or drugs to help, or something. Anything. I've mentioned this to doctors during my life and they always just give me ADD drugs which do nothing for me. I don't want to say I'm desperate because I've taught myself to deal with this over my life, but I think if I found something that would help give me relief from this constant assault

My son has a book from his previous school that he made with his teacher that contains a picture and recipe of something they cooked each week. My son likes to look at this book every once in a while but is by no means attached to it.

I picked him up after work from my mum's house last week and he had been writing in his recipe book. He had written a date on most pages. I noticed that the date on the spiderweb cake page was near Halloween and the date on the easter cake was near Easter. Then I checked and found that the dates were all on a school day one week apart. He remembers the date on which he cooked each item. This book is from 5 years ago. 5 frickin' years. 

I asked him about it and in his one word responses he seemed to think it was no big deal. He just remembers. He has some other impressive talents and I've always thought he was amazing regardless but this one has finally popped my brain balloon! And the thing that gets me the most is what else does he know that I don't realise he knows?

Anyway

TL;DR: My son has a data bank.

I worry about peak oil and the economy. Growing up
early age. I enjoy long walks on the beach. I once wrote an article for my mother about men’s pocky. I
pick water types as my starters. I play with items off. I think pink is a manly color. I am a bronie. I am a
democrat. I am aware of all internet traditions. I make Chuck Norris jokes.
 
I am an autistic
 
I was diagnosed with Autism
remember exactly how I reacted to learning I was an autistic. I do know that I never made a big deal of
it
however glad to get out of the classrooms
were later on.
 
But I’m getting ahead of myself
living with autism? I can’t honestly say how different I would be if I wasn’t an autistic. All I know is that
one day I was defined as having Asperger’s Syndrome. A high functioning autistic
another brand. Not that I minded
 
In fact
I meet
a result, and they didn’t bully. It was just so
frustrating being in such slow classes
to be utter morons. Obviously today I know that’s not true
 
I think I may have seen my diagnosis as a blessing under that logic. Finally
of the herd of children and that I deserved respect! I have always wanted respect from adults more
than respect from children my age – which as a result made me grow up as a loner. I preferred going on
forums
enjoyed.
 
As an autistic
they like
wise man once said “You can lead a horse to water
you will probably find it absurdly difficult to understand why you have to do things. And if you are the
parent of an autistic
do things they do not understand are important. As hard as it sounds to believe
chores, simply because I did not understand why they were important.
 
Imagine it this way. A man comes up to you
why
and being told to do something you do not find important. Even I don’t really know how to handle this
 
problem
Perhaps you/they won’t understand why
that will go a long way towards them complying.
 
Onto the next subject – bullying. Autistics are bullied. Especially in the lower grades. Most children
simply do not understand autistic children and will act accordingly. People are afraid of the unknown.
If you are an autistic child, do not let it keep you from trying
to make friends. I made that mistake
relationships. Thankfully, no
matter what you do
 
You cannot avoid this, not to put your children in a “special” program to try
and protect your autistic child if they are high functioning. They do not work. Autistics need to learn via
trial by fire how to deal with their peers
many cases due to the even larger language gap. Plus, but
beg you keep your children out of special programs – they are hell. The politicians
will all try to convince you otherwise
 
Perhaps there are genuinely good programs for the autistic at your local school. It is possible
unlikely. I have been in quite a few such programs
to be among the best in the entire nation. By the middle of my first year there I was literally begging my
father to please make them put me back in the regular classes. “Special” programs are understaffed
overstuffed
to restrain children. That was literally the only thing I ever saw them get right. Don’t take this the
wrong way – most teachers who are a part of such programs do care
undertrained and understaffed.
 
Even if your child is a low functioning autistic
absolutely your last option
specialized school that has the resources required to properly taking care of your child. They will thank
you later. I hate to be so passionate about this
you that placing your child in a special care program is among the worst possible options you have. If
it is an aid program designed to supplement normal classes
into
away.
 
Instead
accommodations, unless it is literally and absolutely
your last resort
 
Onto the next subject, you are no less
important than anyone else
understand many things
cannot understand. You may even be alone
 
fortunate enough to receive a lot of mental support
 
It will probably get dark in your life. You will be confused. You may even think you are worthless. You
will feel lost
hard it can be to think otherwise
will eventually get good at them. It might take a short period of time. It might take years. But never give
up.
 
Finally, is that it does
not make you different. Yes
important thing to remember about autism – it does not make you more or less of a person.
 
In closing, never stop trying. Please, never
give up. There are people who care. There are people who are worth living for. For parents
trusting in your child. They are beautiful in their own right; you just have to learn to love them. And if
you’re reading this, or
outcasts. Don’t be afraid to meet us. Don’t be afraid to step to our aid. We are just like you. We live like
you
 
We are human too.

1336965269.0,tlwod,So we had a meltdown tonight...,lifeinsector4,31,5,29,"My 7yo had a meltdown tonight when we tried to go to a restaurant for Mother's Day dinner.  
We were with my wife's family and the place was so crowded that they had set up tents outside to hold the people waiting for tables. I was carrying her around outside and I could feel her getting tense with so many people around; but we played around some and she was laughing - she seemed fairly well adjusted...  
...until we tried to walk inside.  
It wasn't loud
We went out to the sidewalk to calm down
After 3 or 4 more screams and some pinching and kicking (again

I should mention here that my wife (and her whole family) is NT but I am not.  
Sometimes we differ in our reactions to these episodes - like tonight.  
If a meltdown isn't too bad, a new/scary/different experience. When it's bad we'll usually change the plan and find something else to do.  
Where we differ is typically in the assessment of how ""bad"" it is and ""why"".  

My wife tends to take a view that the daughter just ""doesn't want to"" and we shouldn't ""let her have her way"". That it's almost always better to ""power through"" and force her to confront her fears and deal with new experiences.  
I (and she) mean that in a much better way than it sounds.

That's what happened tonight. She said we shouldn't let her ""have her way"" but I vehemently disagreed - that this wasn't something that she was going to adjust to (crowded restaurant, and it wasn't a good idea to try.  
She didn't seem like she was going to calm down very fast and I dislike making her *that* uncomfortable without a really good reason.  
I don't really care what other people think about her meltdowns and screaming but I thought it would be pretty rude to force that on a restaurant full of people trying to enjoy Mother's Day dinner - she can scream really

My wife gave in but there was a heavy cost. She was really disappointed having to leave and cried (quietly) almost all the way home.  
The daughter thought she ruined Mother's Day for everybody and I think my wife is blaming both of us.  

My daughter even had the idea of having a ""restaurant"" at home and wanted to make menu's and everything. I told my wife I'd make her anything she wanted for dinner and we'd have a great time.  
She just cried and told us she wasn't hungry - then suggested I take the girl out for dinner someplace alone.

I'm heartbroken now. I feel like I failed my family on Mother's Day.

My wife won't talk to me; she's doing that stupid act where she pretends everything is fine.  
Sorry for the downer post

**TL;DR: I think we screwed up Mother's Day and I'm sad. Sometimes this shit sucks (self-post; no karma)**

*EDIT/UPDATE: Well
This morning she said she wasn't mad anymore and that just made it worse for me.  
I understand that she was disappointed but I don't think she has any cause to be ""mad"" about it.  
Now I'm more upset because I feel bad that the night was ruined and she was disappointed but I really think she's wrong and I have to advocate for my daughter - if it was just me
So now she's stomped all over my triggers and I'm essentially non-functional today.  
Thanks for the input and support*

Jonathan Brunot was born on March 14, and his vocabulary built steadily as he began to learn to speak. However, when he was about 2½ years of age, he began to regress dramatically. His eye contact became non-existent and the few words and even phrases he had mastered in the previous months slipped away into completely non-verbal interaction. Jonathan was diagnosed as severely autistic, and the lives of the Brunot family changed dramatically from that moment.

Olga

Jonathan wasn’t merely an “autistic” individual; collectively

Throughout Jonathan's development, swimming, and basketball, among others. The goal was to maximize Jonathan's opportunities in life and find his niche. Because of Jonathan's inability to proactively pursue new activities and endeavors, Olga took it upon herself to effectively “throw him in the deep end” and immerse him in EVERYTHING.

It was precisely this determination and persistence that prompted Olga to have Jonathan join a special needs running program called Rolling Thunder in 2007. The volunteer coaches at Rolling Thunder specialized in assisted running with the mentally disabled and they welcomed Jonathan with open arms.

When Jonathan first joined the running club he struggled tremendously. For the first couple of weeks, or wanting to lie down. In fact, Olga began running side by side with Jonathan, at times gripping his waistband to literally pull him along the trails. Despite 2 months of weekly practices, Jonathan was still not really grasping the concept of running. Olga, exhausted from pulling his weight and exasperated by his lack of progress, was ready to quit and move her son on to another activity.

Thankfully, refused to allow Olga to give up on the process. He informed Olga that the point of the program was to keep pushing, even when the outcome looked bleak. It was that conversation and Olga's ultimate decision to continue with the program which led to the fateful day when Olga was introduced to a volunteer running coach named Vincent Del-cid.

Coach Vincent needed only one week to get Jonathan to finish a 3 mile trail without stopping. He saw potential in Jonathan and made it clear to Olga that he was prepared to commit to Jonathan's progress long term.

Over the next year, Jonathan lost around 25 pounds, as he became comfortable running longer distances and trained 3 times a week. He went from 15 minutes per mile (for a 5k race) all the way down to under 8 minutes! Socially, Jonathan was developing a clear love and passion for the sport of running. On “running” days, Jonathan would come from school happy and eager to put on his shorts and sneakers to go run with Coach Vincent.

Jonathan had found his niche; he was a runner and he loved to run.

After a year and a half of consistent training

Coach Vincent informed the family that he intended to train Jonathan to run and finish the ING NYC Marathon. He challenged that family to put their trust in him to help Jonathan successfully navigate 26.2 long

On November 2

Today, autistic marathon runner. He has 10 marathons and 1 ultra-marathon under his belt and is showing ZERO signs of slowing down.

** We were at the Boston Marathon.  Jonathan and his coaches were 3/4 of a mile away from the Finish Line when the bombs went off.  Jonathan was diverted to the side streets of downtown Boston.  He has no idea what happened and is blissfully untraumatized from the experience***
    Long Island Marathon 2013
    Caumsett 50k Race Ultra-Marathon Long Island (30 miles)

Despite his incredible success as a runner, as well as to deal with any of the potentially dangerous situations that can arise when running amongst tens of thousands of runners. In many ways, Jonathan's coaches take on the role of coach, parent, medic, nutritionist and special needs instructor each and every time they sacrifice their bodies to help him reach the finish line.

Yes, positive attitude and training, an autistic individual is only limited by the constraints that we put upon them. The joy and happiness that we experience as a family each time we see Jonathan run towards the finish line cannot be encapsulated in words.

Jonathan's running has given us a beautiful gift – an experience that galvanizes us around our champion and his triumphs. In essence

Jonathan is my youngest brother. He could not speak or write this on his own so I had to speak for him. Jonathan inspires me each and every day... and he doesn't even know it! We don't care about his time or his pace; watching Jonathan run is one of the most fulfilling experiences of our lives,False,self,t5_2qhs6,False,,,t3_1k7rb6

A couple of the stupider news reports linking the CT school shooter with Asperger's have really pissed me off. I'm worried that anyone with that in their folder is going to be looked at as a potential mass murderer. Which is ridiculous.

Has anyone else been kept awake by this? Anyone had an interaction with someone that seemed.... off?

We went to a local ice cream and burger joint and everything went fine during our dinner. When we got our ice cream he got a little excited and started running around. I would get up from our table and ask him to come back. He always listens if I try and have fun with him. I try to never force him to do anything because a sudden change like that causes him to throw pretty massive fits. 

I got up a few times and was thinking of getting a high chair (he's three) when an old man starts scolding me. He asked, ""Oh, well, you shouldn't take him out."" ""What do you expect me to do, lock him in the house?"" To which he replies, ""You shouldn't take him here."" 

Now, you better be prepared for what I have to say."" I storm off and get my things from the table. My face is flushed red with color and I felt like I'd never be that embarrassed again. I can't stop my tears, my shoulders were shaking as I wept. The manager stops me and asks me if I'm okay. I pointed at the old man and said, ""ASK HIM!"" (Pretty dramatic I know, but I was very emotional.)

I went outside, ""Go, just go. GO!"" and I stared him down until he and his wife couldn't crane their necks any longer. I figured I made him feel bad enough. I mean, I'm not going to cuss out an old ignorant man and his wife. I'd be just as bad as they are.

I don't know how many people have to go through this kind of thing. I hope no one does. As I got back into my car a woman came outside with red eyes and tears down her face. She said she saw the whole thing and asked if she could help. I still hadn't completely calmed down but I smiled and said you can't really do anything. I didn't even know what to do. I told her I was happy that at least some people have compassion. She was so nice and told me that a friend of hers has an autistic grandson. She made sure I knew about our local events and awareness groups for families of autistic people. We hugged and I climbed into my car. 

As I drove down the street trying not to cry I realized she never told me her name. I don't know why but this sticks out in my head the most. I wish I'd gotten her email or something. People like that are too nice to just walk away from. Especially if they are active enough go on autism awareness walks with her friends.

David is 10 and is one of the lights of my life.  When he was in second grade he was evaluated for speech therapy and slipping grades.  Over the last few years we've seen autism curb his growth more and more...

Public school hasn't provided what he needs so my wife has stopped working and is a stay at home - home school teacher for him now.  She works so hard.  The time and attention has really allowed David to soar and he's working at grade level despite his disadvantages.

He is so sweet

He's akward

Last night I picked him up from soccer practice.  As he came walking across the field I could see his eyes were red and he was crying.

""What's wrong buddy?""

""They were making fun of me

""Oh sweetie

""I was telling them to stop teasing me

""Come here buddy."" &lt;hugs&gt; ""I'm sorry they were being mean to you.""

""Coach made them stop.  He told them what autism is.  He told themI have it.""

""Yeah

""Yeah.""

""Well, not worse, not better.""

""I know

""Sweetie, I wish it wasn't that way.""

""Yeah...they say I'm dumb and they call me stupid.""

""You know that's not true, software developers, fire fighters - being different doesn't mean your dumb.  They're wrong.""

""Will I have autism when I grow up?""

(my heart collapses into a cold ball as hard and dense as a singularity in the center of a black hole.  I manage to keep the quaver from my voice and the tears from my eyes)

""Yes sweetie.  It's not something that goes away.  But!  As you grow up we're going to teach you to cope with it.  We're going to help you understand it.  So long as you keep working hard you'll be just fine, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.  Mom and I will be here to help though, I promise.""

""Yeah...""



It's hard being an autism parent.  As I talk to and comfort my son this way I'm watching the other kids running across the field

This is the part you're going to hate me for.

There's this one little girl - Sarah on David's soccer team.  I've seen her tease him.  I've heard her say cruel things.  I've seen David blow her off and go on about the game having fun.

I've seen the way she skips across the field

Compared to my lumbering

And I wish and I hope and I pray that Sarah's children have autism.

I want her to spend the first 20-30 years of her care free life in cheerleading, she'll have everything in the world...until she gets a note from the teacher in second grade.

I want her broke because she can't work and has to care for her children.  I want her tired from working two jobs so her husband can stay home and takre care of them.  I want her to have to spoon feed her child EVERY SINGLE FUCKING BITE OF THEIR FOOD FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIFE UNTIL THE DAY SHE DIES!  I WANT TO HEAR THE CRACK AS THE STONE OF HER HEART SHATTERS WHEN SOME LITTLE BITCH CALLS HER CHILD A FREAK.  I WANT HER TO FEEL THE BLACK HOLE IN HER HEART WHEN HER CHILD ASKS HER IF THEY WILL HAVE AUTISM WHEN THEY GROW UP.

I'm sorry.

Autism Spectrum Disorder
Dear Shopper

Yes, sanity-shattering screech. Even if I wasn’t seeing and hearing it, I would know by the expression on your face.

Clearly

That is what you were wanting to say

I have no doubt that you have wonderful, law-abiding citizens who would never have dreamed of screaming like this in public when they were children. Judging by your expression and utter exasperation, you’ve never hesitated to let them know who was boss.

And I know that you did your best with your children, in all probability, a good person. You probably don’t mean any harm.

This is what complicates what I want to say to you. Because, even though right now I feel like it.

Because I know some of that anger is misdirected. It is misdirected because I, along with almost everyone, have stood in public and watched a scene like this one play out and thought to myself, “Clearly she has no control over her children. When I have children, mine will never behave like that.” I, like most people, wasn’t quite as obvious about it as you. I didn’t stare or make comments that could be heard. But I was every bit as decided. So, who refuses to be put in its place.

The nice thing about human nature, a single human interaction, to the contrary of your own strongly held convictions. Then presto whammo — you are a new and hopefully improved person.

Let me introduce you to my child. Like you, burped, and inhaled his sweet baby scent and thanked God over and over for the gift of him. Like you, I had certain dreams for my child. There your path and my path diverged somewhat.

My precious child is autistic. Yes, no, my son is not likely going to be a great card counter. The truth about autism is that it encompasses a wide spectrum of abilities. And, like you and me, every autistic child who has it is different from the next. Yet they do often share some similar traits – sensory overload and meltdowns are one of them.

Every person on the planet has what I think of as an internal alarm system. Most of us have ours in good working order. But some people with autism have what I like to call a hair-trigger alarm system. Theirs can go off with what seems to average folks like little to no provocation. There IS always provocation. Non-autistic people simply aren’t as sensitive to seeing and hearing the triggers, including the people who love them. When you see me “placating” my child and “giving in” to his tantrum, I’m really just desperately looking around for the alarm key or trying to remember the right code to turn off that blaring alarm. It isn’t his fault. And, no matter how upsetting it is for you, let me assure you it is that much more upsetting for him.

I’m sorry that you haven’t had quite as pleasant of a shopping trip as you had anticipated. It hasn’t been so pleasant for me either. Problem is — I have to feed my family, etc. just like you do. And, unfortunately, no one arrived at my house today to watch my child so that his autistic behavior wouldn’t upset anyone in public. I have to leave the house and so does my child. Because I have to teach him about the world. I have to let him practice controlling his alarm system. So that he, too, can possibly be a productive citizen making come true all those dreams I had for him when he was so small.

With so many advances in early detection and therapy, others –and, sometimes, even the grocery store.

I’m hoping that your single human interaction with me has given you an opportunity to be a better person. For, a pat on the back, or a “Bless your heart, honey, hang in there” to refill a stressed out parent’s reserve of patience and calm. You could be the bright spot in our day. And, then, if you want, it is an opportunity to educate and dispel myths.

And, you will be standing there when the alarm gets turned off. Maybe you will get to see what every mother wants the world to see – the wonderful personality of her child, in our case hidden behind a mask of fear, anger and frustration.

Who knows? Maybe I’ll get to see the one hidden behind yours.

I really didn't knew where to post this

I always was different. Since i was a month old, held or talked to. I only cried a lot and contact with my parents made it even worse.

I behaved very odd during my childhood
I had done some really odd things
I started to talk in my self
I really read a lot of books back then.

When I was 7
I didn't even made eyecontact with te man
Sinds then I always have been having medication and therapy.
At later age, depents on the aspect. (this I do believe in)

At school I was bullied at. Since I can remember
Long time (although I don't remember much of that time)
When I was 18 I moved to another school
I did not knew how to act. It was a whole new world to me

School and work (I have worked at age 16-18) where war-zone's for me. It felt that way.
There was noise, talking, yelling, looking, moving. There where always threats I saw, and there where huge fears.

I was trapped inside my mind. My mind always becomes a thick white fog

I can not talk in that state. Nor can I process anything or really do something.
It is still very annoying

Anyone who reconizes this?

I have been having these destructive moods lately, angry and frustrated that I yell at some one, or I start hurting myself.
Afterwards I am cleaning up the mess I made

There are moods where I only am able to think that I must die

2 years back, there I was diagnosed with autism, and a year later, I was admitted to a facility, designed to help people with autism, to give them support for work and a home.

A lot of us go to an more independed home

I might sign up for that.

Now I have activety's on the terrain
There are nurses here at this unit
I am happy here, and structure.
Things are finally good, I like to call it Darkness) 


Another thing, I started talking in myself a lot. 
Since I was 15, and I still do it a lot, sometimes even in public.

Anyone who reconizes this?

This was most of my story

Update 2:
Hi, and they say that all these years I have been overasked, always too much pessure. I thought about it and I understand it. Until my 18th nobody knew what autism was, so everyone asked a lot of me. And this year in this facitity, I finally saw that nobody wants to put pressure on me anymore, they actually want me to be happy!

My son is a super high functioning 1st grader.  He has had classroom support in the past but doesn't at the moment.  He is doing great and gets along with all the other kids.

They mean well but even his kindergarten teacher last year called attention to it.  She decided it would be ok tell the class that ""we even have an autistic student in here"" as part of her presentation.  She didn't say it was my boy but it didn't take a genius for the parents present to do the math.  We had 2 different parents come up to us at different times to tell us how great my boy is 'doing'.

Background: I am a high school senior at a school for students with autism. I am in the gifted/college-bound track (gifted programs within special-ed are rare, the general consensus among my friends was that we, in many ways, do not suffer in not only does it give us a unique perspective on things, but thanks to early intervention we have had many opportunities (small school, therapy, integrated social skills curriculum) that the vast majority of K-12 students in the US don't get. 

So

I realize that the way we've worded the slogan will offend some people because it seems like such a blanket statement. It has been suggested to me that we change it to ""I don't suffer from **my** autism..."" but this doesn't have the same ring to it in my opinion.

Does anybody have any suggestions for a better way to phrase this sentiment before we bulk print them?

Also: We want to donate proceeds to an autism-related charity. However

1351389372.0,1278lc,Looking for sensitive solution to issues with an autistic neighbour,JBMick,20,1,29,"Hey guys

In April this year I bought my first house, the location is fine and I could afford it with help from my parents.

In the middle of September I came home from work and found an old ford fairlane parked in my garage. Neighbours told me it belonged to the guy two houses up (where there's no garage, and had been in hospital since before I moved in. He'd only just come home again where he lives with his parents. He owns the fairlane but doesn't drive it on the road (it's unregistered) and it used to belong to the previous owner of my house (I'll call him Mr C) who let him have it after he got too old to drive it. The previous owner had also let him park it in the garage for more than fifteen years.

Short story is I couldn't get the guy to move his car, so after talking it through with them and another couple of neighbours, I relented and let him park the fairlane in my garage again for a while. They said it'd give them time to fix things and settle their son down. Several times a day for more than a month he's been checking in my garage windows to see his car is still there, but he isn't a problem other than that.

Now it's Sunday the 28th October, and I'm offside with two other neighbours who think I'm being selfish wanting to get it out because I'm single with two cars, and there's a lot of tension in the neighbourhood. My direct neighbours on both sides think the fairlane should be towed and scrapped or at least locked back in the owner's back yard under a car port where it'd been while he was in hospital. Before all this happened I'd been ignorant of autistic people, so I've been googling myself mad trying to figure out a solution. From what I can tell this guy depends on routine and one of the strong parts of his revolves around owning that car and keeping it garaged in my garage. Without that, he's a problem his elderly parents can't cope with. With it, he seems to get on well with most of the neighbourhood and they can all live together peacefully.

I have to get his car out and this problem solved by Tuesday lunchtime. Help, and it may be scrapped as it's a wreck and its registered owner (the guy who used to own my place) is dead. If I do that it's going to give the autistic guy's parents all kinds of problems they haven't had for fifteen something years, and make two sets of neighbours hate me. If I leave it there I'm defeating the purpose of the house I bought. I don't have the knowledge or skills to work around this guy, and from what I can glean online that's the essence of his parents' problem too.

I have a service dog. After learning all the weird things he needs to do for me on a daily basis, we were working on training him to get me out of a crowded building on a cue so that I will feel more confident in public. When my system gets overtaxed I will sometimes have sensory meltdowns or sensory storms where my brain stops being able to process incoming information. When that happens I stop being able to understand the world around me, I can no longer read, talk or understand how to navigate the isles in the grocery store.

Yesterday when I was out training my dog I happened to walk past a bell ringer outside a store, with wrinkles to prove it. 

I guess his response, I've been accused multiple times of being aloof or downright rude since I make very little eye contact passing people (even friends and acquaintance) and have a hard time responding to simple hellos. I've pissed so many people off who seem to think it is their right to get outraged by what they assume is my rudeness. I've even had people come up to me and chew me out publicly. I thought the confrontations might ease up as I got older since people wouldn't see me as a kid anymore and think it was their right to ""teach me manners"". I guess the take home for me on this is that it will keep happening and that I'm going to keep offending people who don't know better. 

If you have read this far, that find it hard when they're already overstimulated from a sensory perspective (from being out in public in a crowd with weird lighting or lots of noise etc) to simply navigate and put one foot in front of the other in stores, office hallways, etc. If they seem off or aren't friendly to you, don't take it personally. They might not even be in a bad mood or be having a bad day, they may just have a disability that makes it difficult to behave in the way you think is appropriate.

To start off I will begin with how I was brought into this world, the doctors rushed an emergency C-section and I was without oxygen for over a minute. My parents are both small, with my dad being 5 foot 6 and my mom being 5 foot 2, but I was still small even for that. As time went on I developed extremely fast though my early childhood, beginning to speak extremely early, with full sentences, I read many many books, I would grow out of it. etc.  I frequently would simply cry

Fast forward to around age 6, Lincoln logs etc. I played games on the computer and handheld games like Bop It! I was fascinated with the plastic shapes they had. I forget the name of them. But they are a famous series of shapes that can be connected to form countless patterns. I would arrange these in patterns for hours on end to myself, and get extremely upset if someone wanted to join in themselves and would do it wrong.  My dad had started to become fessed up with my eating behaviors and started to force it (parents, please don't do this ever. it makes the experience terrible) I was told almost daily I couldn't go to school, I would get things taken away unless i cleaned my plate, or bowl of cereal etc. This continued from about age 6 to around age 10. We finally got to see some sort of doctor who simply told him to not ever force me to eat something. But he has maintained this ""Ill do it myself cus I know how to fix him"" mindset, and it's miserable. 

Oddly even during my early elementary school years I either brought my own food from home (a peanut butter sandwich, it is because I am underwight, very slim and they see that as unhealthy, so they attempt to force me into their proper body image.

Age 13, which is a sensory processing disorder, VERY closely related to autism. I get overwhelmed to what you all find ""normal"" sensory inputs. The best way i can describe it is if you have a pet peeve that you don't like people making the ""slurping"" noise through the straw at the end of their drink. Except instead of it just slightly irking you, it triggers a fight or flight response and it's either I move far away, or I stop whatever is making the noise. and it is this way for countless sounds, smells, textures, I respond to them at such a heightened level I can't deal with them. I like to eat my food alone( since my family usually doesn't also want to eat the same few foods often as the ones I do) so I don't have to look, and when I talk to someone I have very little issues making eye contact etc. But I have a hard time making friends, I just never felt like people were friends with the real me. My big problems come from groups. If there's a group larger then about 15-20 people. I start to get overwhelmed by the small noises and chit-chat

So how did school go? Well to be honest. This is my biggest regret. In 2nd grade I was noticed for flying through math books etc. I was placed into a select group of gifted students who not only worked with brain teasers and puzzles(think tetris but instead of making lines you have to make a Square, algebra in 2nd grade. The algebra didn't challenge me, and I wanted to work with the brainteasers and patterns more. And for some reason i stopped going to the gifted program. I don't know why the school had me leave. But I was back to regular school where nothing challenged me still. And nothing really ever has. I am writing this at 17. I do every single math problem in my head, often faster then you can do it by writing it down. for new lessons, I would often skip ahead of the teacher and ask infront of the whole class why we weren't exploring other facets of a particular thing. I never took notes unless required for a grade, and even then only took them about half the time. It was wasted effort to me, why spend so much time writing it down when I had memorized it all just by seeing it, or standarized tests. I had to find ways to game the system to create challegnes for myself, but the sheer amount of ""busywork"" that had piled up was too much for my easily-overwhelmed-often-highly-stressed-self to do. So i dropped out, I couldn't motivate myself because I had no interest in doing more useless work when I already understood and wanted to move along. So i dropped that and am now simply getting a GED. I will end up finishing highschool early. In my aptitude-test for the GED to test my knowledge across various subjects to make sure I do not need to brush up on any material before I take the full on GED test. I scored as if I had already completed a year of college level courses. and my national average across the subjects ranged from 97-99th percentile. Oh and I did the 2 mathematics portions of that test all in my head as well. 

So here I am now, I've read and seen movie's of hers years ago. I read another book, written by someone who has autism and synthesisia. I have taken IQ tests from Psychologists and scored a 150 IQ. All my life I have been misunderstood, and there has only ever been one person who truly understands me. my mom.

So what do I want to do with my life? Well I am big into video games. Not like playing them, for how long etc. All based on an interactive experience. I have always been drawn to a computer. I have been gaming my whole life. In december of 2011 a new blog section went up on a popular gaming community site. I joined a public chatroom to talk with the creator of the blog, and because he was going to be busy soon he needed some guest posters, I volunteered and started posting there. I was doing what I have done all along, I started getting paid for it. And now I can move on in my life, hopefully college will challenge me(I expect it to) I can attend a university and get a degree in game design. and I have found what I believe is MY purpose. 

Thanks for reading, maybe you can see how we perceive the world. I am one of the most observant people, so if you have any question, no matter how specific I will try to help you from both what my mom did to help me, and what I feel was the problem or what I did myself.

He is ""high functioning"" in that he can work a low-skill job and answer questions, but he cannot coordinate his own transportation, initiate conversations (except rarely with immediately family). 

A couple days ago there was a conversation at my house

He'd never shared this before. The fact that he had such a clear memory from so long ago triggered something in me. Beyond the... infinite compassion that that particular idea embodied. 

Since then I have been CONSTANTLY thinking of what an incredibly awful brother I had been for the majority of my life. I would never let him play with me and my friends, and just one or two wins in there could have made him extremely happy. He would routinely eat more than his ""fair share"" whenever we ordered pizza, and I would make a HUGE deal out of how he got more pieces than me -- even though I didn't really need more than what I ate. I just thought it was ""unfair."" Even though food is one of the FEW things that he gets to fully enjoy. I still tried to take that away from him. 

My parents tried on several occasions to get me to go to sibling workshops

For several years in adolescence I barely acknowledged him on a daily basis

I vividly remember one episode when I was around 8. A friend was over, throw it up in the air, and tell my mom that my brother did it. It was all my idea, and I had no reason to be so cruel. He was admonished for it, and I can't stop thinking, I just CAN'T stop thinking -- he must remember this. I was a stupid kid, I was an awful brother

I like to think that now I'm a good brother. I go out of my way to make conversation with him every time I'm over there, ever. I bring him random gifts that are perfect for the few interests he has.

My name is Rory and I am one of the programmers working on a project (Named Project Autismus: Facebook Link - http://www.facebook.com/groups/ProjectAutismus/) that will help teach autistic children to develop social skills and looks to improve their quality of life through gaming. 

We are a completely not-for-profit organisation

The project leader for this project is Druhin Mukherjee

The first game in the series is called Nurf Land and it helps kids to distinguish between various human emotions.

Through his guidance and with the help of Psychological experts we are currently nearing completion on Nurf Land and are currently around $464NZ~($384 US~) off reaching our target to get the licenses required to finish the game.

The game will be released for free on iOS and Android devices and will have no in game micro-transactions or any monetisation of any kind.

He doesn't nap every day now, conking out almost immediately, or something in between where he puts up a good fight for a few hours and then passes out.  

Of course, and I do my damndest to enjoy it.

Bedtimes and naptimes are, and it's always a tradeoff.  If we do get him to nap, I can recharge in the afternoon, but he'll stay up so late that any hope of doing anything productive or of quality in the evening is pretty much gone.  

But, composed, and difficult to rattle person--to the point where I don't think I even recognize myself anymore.


When my son started showing signs of autism a bit after age 2, my heart shattered into a thousand little pieces.  I still have not recovered in the year since his declaration, despite doing all the ""right things"", like getting involved in Early Intervention services, getting a formal diagnosis, starting various therapies, etc..

And even though right now, I struggle with how very little of my own life is not dictated by the whims and needs of this mysterious, challenging, and yet desperately loveable little boy.  


I find myself still bitterly clinging to the me that got left behind without me even knowing it.  The me that could (and did) relax easily; the me that felt in control of her life; the me that believed she could be a good parent.

I don't think I'm a bad mom to my son; I'm overall proud of the attention and energy I give him.  But it comes at a price

It wouldn't be so damned hard if even the smallest little pleasures in life weren't also robbed from me.

I can tolerate not going to fancy restaurants

But I miss being able to read the paper for 20 minutes while relaxing at a coffee shop.  When I try to emulate something similar, pity for my son (""he doesn't understand what's going on...it's not his fault he's having a hard time""), regret (""I never should have come here""), resentment (""if my kid was normal things wouldn't be so damn hard""), and fear (""will I EVER get to go back to anything resembling the way things were?"").


I mourn for the person I am no longer.  I miss the me that never yelled, let alone basic composure.  I miss the me that felt confident in my ability to handle lifes challenges; to figure out the solutions, and keep plodding along in a forward trajectory.

I know I can't expect my friends or family to understand how I feel...I know my husband doesn't even really get it.  Not that he doesn't feel stressed in his own right

I feel very mixed feelings about the fact that I'm looking forward to working full time so I can justify paying half my salary to hire someone else to watch my son.  Right or wrong


I'm not looking for anything other than to put out my own thoughts in a space I can hope is without judgment.  I spent the vast majority of my time censoring my inner monologue to my loved ones because I don't want to be ungrateful of the overall blessing that is my son.  I do love him.  And I do love EVERY part of him.  And my life could be so much worse; I could be in a bad marriage (my husband is amazing) or in a bad spot financially (we make ends meet, etc.

I am an adult dealing with a crisis but I also have a life time of trauma. I was raped at 16 and then again at 18 by two different men. I've endured social ridicule my whole life and have been teased and taunted as a child. I recently found out 3 years ago that I am autistic which explains my social awkwardness and why people treated me bad. My father died when I finished my BA in pre-med (I am autistic but have a very high IQ) and I had to take on the role of care taker for my sick mother and little sister. I never had the chance to go to medical school. 

I skipped from job to job (before my autism diagnosis) because my managers stated that the other women in the office ""didn't like me"". I then lost my career and had to start waiting tables in order to pay bills. I worked 3 jobs at a time but always had issues with customers and so I had to leave that career behind too. I eventually had to leave my mother and sister to care for themselves because my life had started to fall apart. They blamed me for a long time for leaving them.

Right when I moved out on my own I was in an accident and injured both knees and ankles and my right hip. I used all of my savings 3 years ago for surgery but now live with chronic debilitating pain and an unable to exercise

Because of my life experiences, severe depression, OCD, ADD and generalized panic disorder. 

I have tried reaching out to people that were my friends when I was younger. I have tried explaining to them that I am Autistic and that I am doing the best I can do but my previous employers and many of my old friends tell me to stop making excuses for my bad behavior. 

Last november I was diagnosed with cancer. My original doctor mishandled my treatment plan and now I'm getting worse. I have no emotional strength left. I am unemployed and have no support. When I was younger I was so strong. I looked at every challenge with the belief that I would survive and thrive. With every trauma that has happened to me (and I've had a lot I am not even mentioning in this post) I've lost strength. 

I feel like I have nothing left. I am exhausted and there is no system to take care of me now that I can no longer care for myself. I've looked into long term psychiatric hospitals but it seems you need to be wealthy to attend them and they're all out of state for me anyway. I don't know what to do.

We tend to interpret “different” as a weakness, and needing to be suppressed. We do not look at differences as something that to value

Why is this? Why do we fear differences? Partly, be like the norm, so I can feel comfortable with it! People have always been “uncomfortable”, even scared of things that are different. They are not as predictable. It doesn’t flow easily with how I regulate. It stands out as different, and will not be accepted! We become anxious; hyper-focused on the negative, and totally blind to the beauty that it may bring. It doesn’t fit our “common mode!”

I have been in the field for over thirty years. I have seen many individuals who are radically different in how they communicate, and how they experience the world. I was a “behavior change agent” and employed to change these people; to make them “normal”, or at least appear normal. Like everyone else, these differences also scared me, especially since it was my job to suppress and change them. I started out in the back wards of an institution, where people with severe differences were secluded from the rest of the world. People who came from lives of abuse, torment, value, did their differences start to appear, something to fear

I look around and still see our “fear” of that which is different, we are definitely uncomfortable with differences, so we immediately interpreted them as bad and needing to be suppressed, or changed. We do more damage by wanting to change our children, then wanting to support them. “ If we make them “look” normal, then they will be happier, and so will we”. If it is not like us, and try and redefine how you see things. Instead of immediately interpreting differences with a negative filter, observe and listen to it to understand it’s value. Look for positive value first

Your children come with a bundle of qualities. Many may look like ours, validate, and support the natural growth of these qualities, the children flourish, develop strong self esteems, and truly feel “safe, accepted, regardless of how strange they initially appear, but will also develop into more competent

I've talked to my dad about it, but my dad has been successful as a lawyer, and I don't see me needing to support my brother so long as I manage the trust decently.  This is really a great blessing as I'm free of a major financial responsibility.

That being said, he goes to an animal shelter in Concord, but he has to be accompanied by his tutor because...well you know.  The other two days he goes to Creative Growth in Oakland.  We really do think that he likes making art, but he doesn't really communicate well.

Side note: if you want a pretty sweet Ghostbusters backpack and want to donate to a good cause, but it's a good cause.

But this really just seems like temporary measures.  We live in the Bay Area, which is a life that I don't see being healthy for him.  So maybe some kind of group home type setting that could give him some work and activities to do?

My parents are old (which is a major source of guilt for them) at 65 and 62 respectively.  Frankly, they won't be able to take care of my brother forever mentally or physically.

Posco is an AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) app. I created it for my high school senior year independent study. For the past year, for Windows 8.
Parents of autistic children are most likely already familiar with AAC apps, causing the device to speak what was selected. For example, a user could press ""Hello"" and then ""My name is Bobby,"" and the device would speak that out loud using speech synthesis technology.

Developing Posco has been about more than just learning new programming languages and SDKs - a large amount of time has been spent testing Posco with children and teenagers with autism at my school and in my community. The feedback I've received has helped me create an easy to use

How can reddit help? Well, many suggesting I charge more. I've opted not to, though, because I know that there are parents out there who, unlike schools and autism centers, don't have bags of money to throw around.

His name is Landon :) and here's kind of whats gone on since he's was born.

Landon's Mom was in denial about him being autistic. Didn't take him to get diagnosed even though it was clear as day that he was. Didn't enroll him into speech classes or any special treatment classes like she should have. He's now five years old and says very limited words. He knows some words used for manners, joker, penguin etc.). 
And now he gets very discouraged when interacting with kids his age because they know so much more than him from what I interpret.

My name is Ricky, this kid is awesome. Everytime I see him, his face just lights up, and he goes crazy jumping around and repeating ""Uncle Ricky"" over and over ""echo"". He hugs me all the time, always wants to play with just me, always wants to know where I am. I take his autism as a blessing in most cases.

The rest of my family just says; ""Awww, guy."" And I know Landon can hear thm and get an understanding of what they mean. So I get upset when they say that around him and tell them to stop saying that, and take him for what he is and do what we can for him. 

My main question is, and simple words.

Should we keep him away from kids that are more knowledgeable than him? He get visibly saddened by them and starts tugging on my shirt to hold him when they're near.

And what is the best way to explain to my family to have them stop saying ""poor guy"" and such? I try to tell them he's a smart kid and that as long as we find something he likes doing


Btw some of the things he does and I have not educated myself about
Covers his ears
Flaps his hands
And echos words

When he covers his ears I just take his hands off slowly and tell him everything's ok.. I don't even know if thats the right thing to do for him.


This may not be very structured

His brother was a very nice kid when I knew him. Here are the updates from the family. Hopefully someone here has some information that could help them out to give Tyler the graduation he has worked so hard for and deserves:

Tyler is an 18 year old high school student with special needs. As a special education student he will be in the public school system until he turns 22. We had scheduled his ""Official Senior Year"" for the 2013-2014 school year. This was supported and approved by the school and district administration at the first of the school year, 2013 we were informed by telephone that things had changed. Suddenly he was now a Senior with enough credits to graduate and would be forced to receive a Special Diploma at the end of this school year. He would also be forced to leave his current school and attend another facility, even further from home, for vocational training until age 22. He is being denied the ""Senior Experience"" which he has worked so hard to enjoy. No picture in the yearbook. No Prom. No grad-night. No graduation ceremony with his family in attendance (there isn't time to arrange this now.) We have sent emails and made phone calls to EVERYONE we think could help us, but without success. If you have an idea, please share your thoughts.

Most recent Update:

Some of you have asked for some clarification of our issue. Actually we have two issues going on. First is the issue of the school denying Tyler his Senior year of high school. I've explained that in the 'About' section above. Basically, even though I have written documentation and notes that prove otherwise.

The second issue is the reason we have the first issue. It is the new transition plan for students with disabilities that Duval county schools has just put in place. Up until now

The new plan is forcing students with disabilities to graduate with a Special Diploma at the end of their 4th year of high school. Then they must transition to another facility until they are 22. There are very few options to choose from

Tyler's teachers did not become aware of this new plan until the same day we did

As I said, that it would not be a place for him to thrive. 

We had NO part in deciding if this would be an appropriate placement for Tyler. This decision was made mostly by people who don't know Tyler at all. They may have read about him in a file, typical, non-disabled school experience, our school district is taking a GIANT leap backwards. Students that have been included in regular education whenever possible, and have thrived there, are now being sent to spend all of their school time with students that are disabled. There will be regression for these students. We cannot and will not let this happen to our son. We have been advocating for him for 18 years and we will never stop!

Autism isn't without it's dangers

Before I had my son, with the right therapies early on he might have been high functioning, but as an adult he's moderate. I thought he was mentally handicapped. That is what autism was to me. Another friend had a son 8 months after I had my son. Early on you could tell something was wrong. He didn't develop like other children and was happy sitting alone. He was diagnosed before a year as having autism. My son didn't talk much or well, and he seemed a little different than other kids, but surely he couldn't have autism, he ran and played with other kids. I didn't know the difference between playing next to and playing with at that time. At 2 I asked his neurologist if my son might have autism. He called my sons name and when my son turned to look at him, he said, he's not autistic. He responds to his name and looks at you."" It was another year before I dared bring up my worries again. 

I have read every one of Jenny McCarthy's books and most of it wasn't appropriate for my son. I couldn't get any doctor to run a blood test on him for heavy metal except for lead. No ABA therapies anywhere. The gluten and casein free diet just made him miserable. I've read everything else I can lay my hands on

I worry constantly about what will happen after I am gone. Will one of his sister's take him in? Will their husbands accept him and be kind? Will he be able to manage on his own? How is he going to afford to live? Will he be able to work? He is so lost in his own world most of the time

I'm sorry this turned into a rant. My original intention was just to ask if my perceptions of how autism is treated and handled was correct. It went way beyond that and I am sorry.

I was talking with a friend a while back. She is NT but she has two autistic children. She once asked her more verbal child (who was under the age of 5 at the time) what it felt like when his senses went haywire.

His response: PAIN. Worse than a physical injury or a spanking. I had never thought about it that way. But it is true. That is what I feel. Intense and overwhelming pain.

I'm told that when my brother was little, permanent obsession with eyes.  Whenever he sees someone he knows well, he will get a big grin on his face and ask them to open their eyes big, close them tight, then blink them repeatedly.  He can tell you the eye color of any significant person in his life.

Being his jealous younger brother, I could grin at him and subtly point at any glass window, and he would become upset that I might break the window (I've never in my life broken a window).

I just never had to think about this before - I dont know where to turn and the wikipedia article is pretty damn verbose when explaining autism.

Im probably asking all the wrong questions but im a mess with everything that has happend before he was diagnosed - I just want to be the best dad I can for my son.

My youngest brother was diagnosed with autism at a young age, milkman?).

Since he's started secondary school his behaviour has regressed to the point i believe he might be dangerous to my family. He's never been punished or told no as he knows how to manipulate my mum into doing anything for him. I'll give an example of some of his episodes for context. I'm not really sure where to start as every day his behaviour gets more shocking

- He has hit my parents and brothers on countless occasions over trivial things for example i refused to give him a burger this morning so he snapped and hit me round the head twice then threatened to kill me. He will also throw himself against things and hit his head on cabinets. 

- He'll swear at anyone who says no to him including telling his headmistress to f*** off

- He's gone for knives before when in a fit. The police were called one night when my Dad couldn't control him

- He has no empathy or concept of other people's feelings for example he threw a huge tantrum on the day of my grandad's funeral because he wanted the new pokemon game.  My uncle

- He refuses to go to bed until around 2-3 at night which means none of my family who live at home have had a proper night sleep in the last 3 or so years which has turned my mum into an exhausted wreck.

- He will accuse people of trying to murder him, he most likely has anger management issues but could there be other issues in addition to autism? he convinced himself he couldn't go to school otherwise this women in the bushes would break his phone, maybe he might be slightly schizophrenic? or he might just be trying to avoid school i'm merely speculating.

I could literally go on for hours my point being he's becoming extremely aggressive

How has it affected the family? Me and my older brother have been at university for the last few years so have missed the worst of it. I would get phone calls from my mum every few days in tears. She's an emotional

He towers over my mum and is surprisingly strong for a 13 year old, my parents have seen a few specialists and he's on melatonin, but today i finally lost the last bit of hope i had   after he tried to hit my mum at 2AM while she was trying to go to bed because he wanted her to buy him a screwdriver off amazon to open his old NES cartridges.

However I love the kid

So reddit what the feck can we do? Apparently there's places we could send him who are more capable of looking after him and my mum could get her life back but it would be completely heartbreaking. I never thought i would think it and resented my family for saying it but it might be time to send him somewhere else. Im worried he might become a danger to society

Any advice would be appreciated

If there's anyone in a similar situation please let me know. Any suggestions are welcome and i can fill in anymore details if needed. 

TL;DR 13 year old autistic brother is violent and uncontrollable

#UPDATE So as i mentioned my parents were having a meeting with the school and i went along to it today for the first time. I stressed the need for medication and psychiatric help. As a result about 5 people are referring him for rest-bite care to get him professional help such as medication. In addition they're funding me to go away to Cornwall with him for a week with other kids with special needs and professionals,False,self,t5_2qhs6,1340626723.0,,,t3_v98rz

Below is a letter from UCP/ARC which  covers the issue. Please follow the instructions below.
 
If you only push yourself to do ONE more thing tomorrow
 
Dear Friends

The fight goes on to have regional centers cover the health insurance deductibles and copayments for autism and other medical treatments required by IPPs and IFSPs -- but we only have a day or two more to make our voices heard.

Thank you to the hundreds of you who emailed Senator William Monning asking him to reject the Brown administration ""trailer bill"" that says regional centers don't have to cover copays and that they cannot not cover deductibles. Unfortunately

Now the fight has moved to the budget conference committee chaired by Senator Mark Leno

Here are the two things we're asking everyone to do now. TODAY:

1. If you live in the district represented by any of the eight legislators on the conference committee

Before your call

Here are the eight conference committee members and their phone numbers:

Senator Mark Leno
Senator Kevin DeLeon
Senator Bill Emmerson
Senator Loni Hancock
Assemblymember Bob Blumenfield
Assemblymember Jeff Gorell
Assemblymember Holly Mitchell
Assemblymember Nancy Skinner

If you don't know whether you live in a district that one of these legislators represents, and blue ""Write Your Legislators"" button; enter your ZIP code; click on ""Go""; and scroll down to the ""California Legislative Action Center"" and ""May Elected Officials.""

2. No matter where you live, Senator Leno is considering running for statewide office and so should pay more attention than most legislators do to people from all over the state. His email address is senator.leno@senate.ca.gov and his phone number is (916) 651-4011.

Thank you for your advocacy.

He had managed to get a little more than 3 blocks from the house. He had already crossed several busy streets that were luckily empty at that moment. Being the little guy he is he didn't pause before running into the street. He never slowed down

Until this incident we have been able to successfully keep him confined to our yard even if he managed to get outside. It was still rare. At this new house it is a constant event that he is trying to get out. I put slide locks up high on the doors. (landlords might be a bit pissed

1321621120.0,mgv7i,Daughter diagnosed with Autism at 27 months. Help?,MadeByMonkeys,13,3,30,"Izzy is a sweet little girl who just doesn't talk very much. She has about 5 words. Sometimes she learns new ones, but happy and affectionate with her family. She smiles

She's been evaluated four times. The first two times she was found in normal ranges even though we thought she was speech delayed. The second two times

Now we're being told she qualifies for services. When we tried to just make appointments with speech pathologists before now, the wait list is a year or more for any sort of speech, physical, or occupational therapy. What the fuck?

Anyway

I asked whether we were obligated to use them or whether there was a choice and they got offended and left their card but didn't schedule a consultation to determine which specific services Izzy needs as they initially said they would. They implied that there would now be a significant delay in treating Izzy because of my indecision over whether to use them.

What other methodologies than ABA are out there? We really think she only needs speech therapy. We think she may be apraxic because she has feeding/swallowing difficulty as well as speech problems. But the evaluators pointed out all sorts of behaviors and facial expressions that were ""wrong"".

We feel sort of adrift here. Any insight or advice would be appreciated. We feel as though we're already behind schedule on getting Izzy some intervention at least for her speech and it seems as though the programs in our state are eager to stretch those delays even longer,False,self,t5_2qhs6,False,,,t3_mgv7i

My son is 11 years old and autistic from birth. He is non-verbal and does not perceive words as communication. He has learned very limited sign language but only relating to his immediate wants and needs. He cannot express himself emotionally except through violence to himself when angry or wild unchecked behavior when he is happy. Conversation is lost on him

Now to the problem... As I said he is going through puberty. it's hitting him hard. He has begun masturbating in his room with his door open as he does not understand boundaries or acceptable behavior in society. The only remedy to this I know is to try and tell him that he needs to close his door and do this in private for obvious reasons. Today it became a problem.

When he got home from school today his bus driver had a disgusted look an her face and her assistant was busy with the paper towels and disinfectant working furiously to clean the seat he was sitting in. As I approached the bus she informed me of his extra-curricular activities on his trip home from school. This was the first time

To the question... Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to help him get control of this or make him understand that this is not acceptable behavior outside of his home? I though about taking him to and from school every day

tl;dr... my 11y-o non-verbal autistic son has hit puberty and is engaging in inappropriate behavior at school and on the bus ride home. Any suggestions as to how we can deal with this without completely isolating him from the rest of the world for the next 3 to 5 years?

He is non-verbal (4-and-a-half years old), etc.  They tried wrapping his finger with tape but he immediately took it off.  They said the only real option is to put a cast on it for a week to keep him from breaking it worse, but said the chances were slim that would actually happen.

My worry is that he is fairly physical when he's mad (slams things, or possibly injuring himself in other manners.

Alex is a thing of beauty, so fragile that you can hardly comprehend how its skeleton holds. I was pulled away from Sedaris to return to my post, a sentry seated next to her tiny body, curled up on a love seat and wrapped in blankets with only her face peering out just so, dimly illuminated by the glow of the television. I bristle when I hear her moan and whimper in her dreams, wishing I could defeat the demons in her mind and bridge the split between our worlds, make sense of the sensory chaos

So I position myself now on the couch beside her, only to be stirred again when her sharp exhales raise the hair on the back of my neck.

Tomorrow morning, she will hug me, but beyond this, my words may as well be a dog's bark echoing in the distance, indiscernible and fading.

For now, squeeze her hands, and whisper nonsense that we both might understand, both trying with our entire bodies to communicate the simple transaction that needs desperately to end with the words, or rather the feeling, of safety.

I'm just curious, are you able to look back on them with anymore clarity, and offer advice to parents?  Children aren't able to communicate a mature and insightful explanation to exactly why they're screaming and thrashing around, but maybe we can?

I never had meltdowns as a child, and then eventually I get to a point where I can relax.  I have a hard time explaining it as an adult, I can imagine it's even harder for a child.  I've always wondered if this might be a cause for some of the meltdowns.  

As an adult, but if you feel as though your child (or you) experiences something like this, these are some things that help me.

1. Removing as much stimulation as possible.  NT's think it's weird, it's a closed in space and I can focus on calming down without the distractions of everything else attacking me.  There's nothing wrong with it.

2. Sometimes it helps when my husband either sits on my legs or lays on top of me completely.  It took him awhile to believe that yes, it really does help.  I can't explain it.  We'll be sitting on the couch and I'll feel this come on, and he sits on my legs with all of his weight and it forces them to not move.  I can tense my muscles easier, and it doesn't hurt as bad.  While he does this, he just keeps watching TV and acting like everything is normal.  If it gets really bad, he'll lay on top of me, full weight.  I can't explain why this works

Earlier tonight a girl I believed to be my friend texted me to tell me to be careful at her housewarming party, and drove to her house. As soon as I got there, I was told to leave please because I was not welcome. I was shocked, I had no idea why I was being asked to go but I left. I asked my friend why I was asked to go, since she told me I could go days ago and showed her her text where she never said she wasn't uninviting me. I left, went back to my dorm with some friends and texted her saying how much that had hurt me and how I don't understand why she had done it. I will now show you her response:

Why do you think i didnt invite you, your rude, and you make not funny comments that offend people, i know you have a problem but its not good for my party. I dont care or give one fuck if your not my friend, all you talk about is your sex life anyway and try to brag about your 'new guys' that no one gives a fuck about. Most those people didnt want you there, they dont know you,or dont like you

I asked her why she's saying she didn't invite me after she had invited me
I cried for almost an hour before I got to the point where I was drunk enough to not feel the pain anymore. I know it's not healthy to do so

I'm upset because this has happened all my life, I can't stand not understanding that when I'm saying something that its pissing someone off. I don't mean to, I don't want to, but sometimes I do it. I hate myself for having this problem, I hate myself for everything. I'm not suicidal, I promise but I just hate myself as a person and its hard to keep dealing with all the drama that I'm having to face. It hurts so much to deal with everything that I have to deal with because I'm autistic, because I just can't see when I'm doing something wrong that's hurting others.

I have concerns that my 19 month old son is autistic and we have an appointment in the upcoming week to discuss it with his PCP. I'm really nervous about what to expect in the screening/diagnosis process. I'm worried about what kind of stress it's going to put on him.

The things that have been raising my concern have been becoming more and more apparent over the past 3-4 months. I didn't want to put off making an appointment any longer; the little research I've done so far has told me that the best thing for a child with autism is to find out early and go from there.



The things that have been raising my concerns are;

* **Delayed speech**. He says a few words (Hi, 'Bubble' in reference to 'Bubble Guppies' which is a cartoon he is obsessed with.) Whereas his twin brother has a very, very wide vocabulary and even says several phrases. *(But he also having a procedure done soon because his upper-lip frenulum is attached between his two front teeth, and we think that may have something to do with his speech being hindered)* But, he also has this habit of saying words once, very quietly like he's whispering.. and then not saying them again.
* **High-strung**. He is generally a really happy toddler, he is absolutely fascinated with ""Bubble Guppies."" In the morning while we wake up, the boys will have their milk and watch their once-daily episode of Bubble Guppies. He will usually have a massive meltdown when it goes to commercial and tenfold when the show is over.
* **Violent(?) Temper-tantrums**. When he throws fits, but a glass screen-door closed. He went into a meltdown and started screaming and hitting his head very hard against the glass until I came back in. Sometimes when he throws fits, he will also pinch/bite me... if not just out-right slap me across the face.
* **""Selective"" Hearing**. (I'm not sure if there's a better term for that.) He generally will not respond to his name. Sometimes he just kind of.. walks around in his own little world and only makes contact when he feels like it.
* **Toys are not toys**. He is very, banging them against various surfaces and then banging another toy almost as if he's comparing the outcome. The entire time he has this very, very determined and analytical look on his face. Only after his toys have gone through this rigorous testing can he actually play with them regularly.
* **Rocking**. It started off where he would get on his hands and knees and rock back and forth to fall asleep.. this being since he was even nine months old. But now


Other than that.. He's a very loving, affectionate kid. He plays well with his brother and in public places, he is pretty out-going and tries to play with other kids. He is even social towards adults. Probably more-so towards adults.

I don't think he is mentally challenged. He has always shown a great deal of intelligence. He can identify body parts. If I ask him where his nose is, as well. He can do things for himself easily, get things for himself easily, and even get his point across.


I am scared. I'm not sure what I am scared of, the less I will be able to protect him from shitty people. 

I feel guilty - almost like I'm perpetuating some stigma about people with autism because I am scared. But it's not that. I just feel so unprepared for this. I feel like maybe I'm putting the cart before the horse. But I'm pretty goddamned positive he is. And I don't know what to do, or that, or that.. or even that!""* I have bipolar disorder, a panic and anxiety disorder, and OCD. It wasn't dealt with until I was 15 and it fucked my life up. I realize fully that my parents just... didn't know how to handle it. And that is the exact position that I want to avoid being in.


Christ

I just found this sub-Reddit after realizing that this could be the first in a long series of steps that my hubby and I take into educating ourselves on the autism spectrum and all the myriad (overwhelming!) things that go with it.

Anyway

Obviously I am no way attempting to make a proper diagnosis myself, I can't pinpoint anything in the restricted/repetitive behavior problems at all). As far as I understand it, this would make him fail the DSM-IV diagnosis for autism.  But...clearly he DOES have developmental concerns.  *So what do you do with something that only ""sort of"" looks like autism?*


Some background:  we have a 36 month old son who is an only child, anywhere from 2-4 days per week.  I am a full-time student/SAHM, and his father works full-time and is a part-time student as well.

Beings that we have always had a very informal (neither of us can stand ""helicopter parents"") approach to parenting and child development, it has not been an easy transition, and it has felt very isolating at times.  

His first area of concern is a language/speech delay (he only says maybe 2 dozen words consistently; a good chunk of his words/phrases are hard to understand, but clearly knows who ""mommy"" is (he'll get excited if I'm not home and say ""mommy"" over and over if his dad asks something like ""do you want to go pick up mommy?"").  Same thing with ""daddy"".

His other area, but over time his teachers have reported that he generally plays alone, and at times can be overly aggressive (especially to smaller kids).  This was also hard to gauge because 1) preferring solo play seemed like it could be a personality thing and 2) being aggressive is often tied into language/communication frustrations.  The other social issues are that he does tend to avoid (about half the time) eye contact, he infrequently responds to his own name, he doesn't always use ""proper"" gestures (he prefers to use an open hand rather than pointing), and he doesn't do much ""pretend play"" other than with cars (moving them, making car noises).  

And since the third component of autism (at least as the medical community is concerned) is repetitive/restricted behavior, because I really don't think he's all that different than any other kid his age.  He prefers the obvious foods; pizza, spaghetti, chicken nuggets, ice cream, etc..  Every question in that section in both the MCHAT and the ASQ and the ASQ-S/E came back with nothing.

His doctor said he feels like there might be something else going on like ODD or Aspergers. He said that unless my son is having social issues in school or it really started affecting his life he didn't want to diagnose him with anything and that there are no good therapy places that he knows of in our area.

If I could find good therapy for him within an hour drive what would be the benefits of getting him diagnosed? Does therapy work? If there's something that I can do for him now to make his life ""easier"" later I'd do it but I am having a hard time figuring out if therapy really does much good or not. I don't have any experience with it nor do I know anybody with Aspergers.

One of my biggest dilemmas with all of this is that I don't know if the things he does is part of something that needs to be diagnosed and treated or if it's just part of who he is. He is highly/profoundly gifted and is two grade levels ahead of most kids his age. I think that his brain doesn't work exactly the same as the other 6 year olds I know so I really can't compare his behavior to what they do but it's hard not to.

I just don't want the difficulties that he has now to magnify as he gets older and cause him a lot of trouble.

*Before I get started, dehumanizingly describe a person with autism as a burden, and negate his experiences and wants. I want my first act to be to apologize for holding these views, and to clarify that my purpose in this post is not to advocate for them, but to ask for help in confronting and changing them.*

My soon-to-be seventeen-year-old little brother is a low-functioning autistic. He is completely non-verbal, as I'm not really clear on the terminology. But then, that's the problem.

I'm nineteen years old, I've struggled with the idea that I might have to provide for my brother in the future. He's not completely toilet-trained yet, so (forgive me for saying this) I don't think a job or independent living is in the future for him. He's also over 6 feet tall and quite heavy for his age, and my (4'11"") mother isn't getting any younger. I can't discuss my worries or other feelings with her because every time I express any reluctance to support my brother, she (understandably) gets angry and tells me that I just don't love him enough. The problem is, I think that's true.

I don't love my brother. I'm angry at him for ruining our family, and for, on top of that, expecting me, my parents, and my other brother to support him for the rest of our lives. Of course, I realize that I probably should have gotten all these problems sorted out a long time ago, or explained to us what would happen if they died

I don't know what to do. I feel lost and abandoned and scared. I should sympathize with the autism rights movement a lot — I'm gay, and I feel like I should be able to sympathize with autistic people, but I just can't understand how y'all, who write books and invent things and support yourselves, are anything at all like my brother who shits in the bathtub, spits water into electrical sockets, walks around the house naked

I'm not sure what I'm expecting to get out of this post. I have a lot of problems, I want to emphasize that all the views I've described are horrible, and I feel like an awful hypocrite for feeling this way.

She's now in preschool through our town's special education program.

Let me try to explain what's happened over the past year

A year ago, and motor therapy. A very slight aversion to textures had mostly vanished, or at least seems to have vanished. Otherwise, she was much the same as when we started. She had a few words now to request things like juice or milk or food, and that was about all. 

Then one day, ""Daddy, I love you. I'm hungry, can I have a snack?""

I bawled. I'm crying writing this. That was the first time Izzy expressed love verbally (we'd gotten some half hearted hugs in the past

over the next 6-8 months, it really is the only way I can think of to relate her transformation.

Izzy started talking in ever more complex sentences, it really seemed revelatory in her case. But talking wasn't the only thing. She started smiling easily. Laughing. Hugging. She started showing spontaneous imaginative play with her toys. A few months ago, Christmas 2012 was the first thing that Izzy had ever expressed excitement for in her life (previously the gift of one of her favorite things elicited a rather terse, ""Oh, I like that. Thank you."") Recently, she was bouncing in her seat, smiling and laughing

It's like the lights are coming back on inside her head

Is this typical for ASD kids? My impression is that progress like this is very hard won for most kids with autism. That sudden

Has anyone else here had an experience like this?

About the only ""relic"" left of Izzy's ASD presentation is her moderate-and-sometimes-extreme aversion to eye contact. If not for that, but I think a lot of young kids are like that..?

This is something I have struggled with for a few years.  Since I first started learning about Autism/HFA/Asperger's and the like

I've been clinically depressed for most of my life and I also have generalized anxiety disorder -- all of this according to a psychiatric assessment done 8 years ago, but my performance declined in high school and into college -- it isn't that I cannot learn or do not know the subject matter, it's just that none of it interests me.  I don't feel it is worth my time (good or bad -- it's a constant struggle with myself).

I have always had *immense* difficulty maintaining eye contact

I have a freakish memory for numbers...I still remember the phone number for that language-learning software

I'm always considered the ""weird"" one in any group of friends I've had.  I make jokes that are sometimes kind of ""out there"", and I have a very, very hard time letting things go/moving on.

Due to my difficulties in college classes, as it were...even if only to put to rest this idea that I could have HFA.  The problem is, I'm afraid that I'll be laughed out of my GP's office for suggesting such a test.  Also, since I have been assessed for attention deficit disorders in the past, I'm concerned that this will all just look like a ploy for ""the spotlight"" or whatever -- which is the last thing I want.

http://carlysvoice.com/

I'm interested in hearing what others

My thoughts:
While the size of Carly's accomplishments cannot be understated, if they had access to the same programming she did.  Several times it comes up that Carly or her father does not want her to be around 'lower functioning' children, and it seems as though her father prefers to think of his daughter as a gifted, special child with autism rather than acknowledge that many of these 'lower functioning' children could realistically be at Carly's level if they had been born into a family able to afford the level of care Carly received.  Rather than feeling compassion for these children they are almost dismissed as 'below' them.  This is highlighted especially well when it is repeatedly acknowledged that Carly still partakes in many behaviors classified as 'lower functioning' (stimming, rocking, slapping, making noises, etc) but doesn't want to be with individuals classed as lower functioning

Beyond this the father goes on to disparage the respite and supported living programs offered to people with autism, are doing the best they can with what little funding they have.  He blames them for the 'poor' care in these facilities when really it is government underfunding that has caused these problems. 

Overall I applaud Carly's work at becoming an autism advocate

I have a tendency to be overcritical (thanks university!) and I acknowledge this might be nitpicky, having only worked in the field for a little under a year, so any responses would be greatly appreciated.

yeah. My beautiful, realizing that he doesn't have to be buck ass naked to drop a deposit in the commode. 6 peepee stickers on the chart earned from multiple spaces. Today was a good day, Dun dun Dun. Then we got to the psychologist office.

I've known my little frogman has not been developing like a typical child for quite sometime. He came into the earth two weeks early and got jammed in the canal along the way. Then he was cut out of me all bruised but a mighty sucker. He would go on the nurse another 18 months. I miss the cure all of the powerful ninny. It was around this weaning age we realized he had a delay in speech development. He'd mastered about 10 words by the time he turned 2. That's when this mama freaked out and started looking for help.

I got him an assessment through our state's program

So we got frogman speech therapy for a year. The year is up and she says he needs more. We tried a different route this time and went straight to a psychologist. She didn't impress me but I think she's right. Frogman is on the spectrum. I broke down on the drive home and wailed through 6 lanes of traffic. Frogman sat in the back oddly quite but occasionally commenting on his precious cars bestowed upon him after exiting the doctor's office. 

So now here were are a year later with a diagnosis we suspected a year ago. I've spent the past 6 hours reading about autism and therapies. Trying to find all of our options. Frogman is a talker, and swimmer and some of the things add up. Like him calling every tall dirty blonde guy in the grocery store daddy. Or when Frogman first learned his cousin's names Lerp and Derp. All little girls were Lerps and Derps for a while. He used to confuse Aunt Ray with Baby Boon. When he saw Queen Latifa in a movie he exclaimed praise to Ms. Shorenay his preschool teacher. I had no idea that facial recognition had anything to do with autism.

Frogman does not know he is a man. He can say penis. Today when he was drawing a face he drew a big circle, added arms, added legs, added a neck and chin. Then of course he said, let's add a penis and so he drew two long ones on either side of the neck.

For example, my cousin has an incredible ability to do impressions of people's voices, which is an extremely useful skill in a premodern society because of their close interactions with birds (especially bird calls) and other animals in nature. He also has a fantastic memory, especially for stories, which is the main method of communicating information in hunter-gatherer societies. And of course, which is honestly pretty rare in the modern world.

I am the big sister of a teen with autism. This teen has had the most rough time in school than anyone I've ever known. He was viciously bullied by kids who were too ignorant to see the potential in him, elementary school was definitely not fun for him. 

Me and our other brother, so we just guessed he was physically sick or something. He's the most funny person I know, very smart too of course. He was so close to being on the honour roll, just a couple of points! He's come so far since he was a kid, screaming when there were loud noises, putting a 30 second clip on loop over, and over and over again.

But through his whole life really

So this summer, to work at a local autism centre. We are just a family support group, we don't do therapy or behavioural interventions or anything like that. All we do is plan conferences and activities. This summer, we were given the task, the other students and I, to make a social skills camp from scratch. 

Not a small task. We printed and laminated dozens of visual schedules

When it was finally time to start

More than once

The teenagers were pretty easy to handle. Of course the group included my brother, and that would have been enough to make me cry. But there's so much more.

We had 3 other groups: 2 of them were younger children

The pre teen one was pretty much controlled chaos, so we had to cut in a lot with them. It was very exhausting, but they often understood how they hurt their peers, so it went well all in all. 

The youngest groups were definitely the most cuddly ones. The best way to describe it by comparing them to kittens. They were all talking at the same time and they would not stop with the hugs. Again, not running off. But all of them were so caring. One made a mess with some tie-dye and he said ""Don't worry, I'll pick it up!"" Our slight anger was of course, instantly dissipated.

All of them have made such tremendous progress. From some that barely talked to us to some that wouldn't stop talking, I can now get through to him when he doesn't understand something. Most of those kids have real conversations and show interest in each other, and the ones who don't now know to look people in the eye when they talk.

Autism was always a part of my life, they were all so intelligent, so talented, and they will go far. 

For their families, but treated him like crap because he was different. He turned out great in the end though, so don't give up!

My SO lost his job back in March. He's always had some emotional turbulence (his father was emotionally abusive, and he manages it pretty well for the most part. But months of prolonged unemployment have made his moods so much more volatile and dark - and frequent. Each rejection letter or reminder that he doesn't have a job just makes things worse, and as millions are finding out in this economy, long-term unemployment can take a severe and lasting toll on even the most emotionally robust.

He's told me repeatedly that I'm one of the only things keeping him sane, except as the weeks drag on, I feel more and more like I'm failing as he slips further into depression. He's on an antidepressant right now but it, too, seems to be less and less effective.

All fairly run-of-the-mill in this recession (sadly), now I know what the heck is going on with my own mind and I can recognize and deal with my own reactions to things around me. But with me, personally, I've found one of the number one manifestations of my autism is a hyper-empathy. If someone around me is happy, I'm delirious for/with them. Similarly, if someone around me is anxious, I pull my hair out - even if the cause of the anxiety has nothing to do with me. I just seem to pick up on other people's wavelengths - it's a huge reason why I almost only ever watch comedies and action movies and have to be in the most exaggeratedly tranquil settings to watch/read anything even remotely depressing or terrifying - it's like I feel everything everyone else feels

Does anyone have *any* advice for how to deal with this? I've been trying things that calm myself down (reading calming things, etc), but it's getting to the point where I'm afraid I myself might have a meltdown if something doesn't give soon with his depression. I love him fiercely and want to do everything I can for him, and he's said he recognizes that, but as we all know, depression is not just something you can turn off like a light switch and I feel like things are coming to a head.

But we do ask for eye contact and if it isn't made, we'll continue asking and provide some prompts (usually verbal/pointing, sometimes making a ""tunnel"" with our hands between our faces so the kid looks at us -- but personally I try to avoid that; it just seems a bit intrusive to me). Then we reinforce any success with enthusiasm.

So my question, or just kind of uncomfortable (it doesn't seem distressing with any of my kids, but they're quite young and some are nonverbal, so they can't really explain how they feel to me)? Any suggestions for understanding and working on the skill?

Thanks for any insight you can provide!",self,t5_2qhs6,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/uxh1v/eye_contact_question/

We noticed a few months ago that one of his eyes seemed to be going lazy. I got a referral to a children's opthamologist from our pedi. I didn't want to waste any time because two of my uncles had lazy eyes that required several surgeries

Our appointment was today and I had called in advance to let them know he has autism and make sure it would not be a problem. (Been turned away from dentists in the past because of autism.) They assured me it was no problem and that they had specialized staff.

The nurse, she was very friendly and gentle with my son. He didn't put up much of a fight for the drops to dilate his eyes and was fine after that.

The actual doctor comes in and my son starts to panic. (Meltdowns are not common with him.) I was holding him trying to calm him down. The doctor alternated between trying to force lights in his eyes and smiling &amp; laughing while staring at his computer screen. I was trying to explain to him the autism and the possible SPD

Without saying a word

Next thing I know

He spends no more than 30 seconds examining both eyes and then says ""He doesn't need glasses

He was acting like a complete fucking asshole. I'm trying to calm my son down and gather my things (my mom was with me and so was my 5 month old son). My son is screaming and hyperventilating and all I can focus on is calming him down. It wasn't even a meltdown, with out saying a word still.

My son screamed the entire way out to the car. Once in the car he was still hyperventilating, and he just kept letting out the most heart breaking whimpers.

He still didn't calm down &amp; return to his normal for half a fucking hour.

I don't even know what to think. 

This is the same kid that doesn't flinch when he gets shots, hell - he didn't even react as much when he dislocated his elbow and had to have it popped back in. I know my son and this fucking scared him.

I don't even know what to think. I checked in advance. Whether they lied and didn't have staff for autistic or special needs children

He didn't even discuss with me why my son has a lazy eye

Is this common? Is it common for people to be so shitty towards autistic children and their families? I don't know if I can get used to that.

But I am going to call the pedi first thing in the morning and ask for a referral to a different eye doc because I do not trust this one

How heritable is Autism? I'm not autistic. Although I have plenty of family history risk factors. Including a very eccentric grandfather who probably would have been diagnosed if he lived today. I get asked occasionally if I'm on the spectrum. It doesn't come up enough for me to pursue getting a diagnosis. Though the thought does cross my mind.

I have an opportunity to work as a direct caregiver to children and adults with varying levels of autism living in a facility that works towards improving behaviors so they can live more independently. I currently live with someone who has been working there for 4 years and from what I understand is this position

Now, maybe something not so clinical that describes what it feels like to live with autism if that makes sense. I do understand that every person is different and there will be no blanket advice but I am hoping to go into this position as prepared as possible and would like to do research outside of their training program.  

Any advice outside of that is very much welcomed as well. Some of the points that stuck out to me from people who do similar work is patience with the children as well as their parents, positive reenforcement and smiling :) Also when someone said ""If you've met one person with autism, you've met one person with autism"" struck a chord.


I am also open to pen pals who work in similar facilites
