Here's what I've got so far:

2 teams

Every upvote increases one team's score. (Not sure if true)

You randomly get weapons and hats by browsing around Reddit. The hats are stylish but do nothing but add up by your username. The weapons can be used on scumbag orangereds to mess with their posts and add stuff like TOM CRUISE etc...

The battle is apex at the original blog post

We won another territory today! /r/RaidersPinnacle. This was my first battle

[This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/RaidersPinnacle/comments/1i9afe/invasion_the_orangered_armies_march/) shows the skirmish scores. Woohoo! We totally beat those ORs.

And thanks to my fellow Periwinkles for supporting [my attack!](http://www.reddit.com/r/RaidersPinnacle/comments/1i9afe/invasion_the_orangered_armies_march/cb2hqs5) Guess what my attack totaled?

&gt; **Skirmish #116 - the victor is Periwinkle by 600 for 143 VP**

That's right - 600 troops! And it kept under the radar the WHOLE time! This is thanks to my fellow Periwinkles for supporting and keeping it quiet!

Imagine if I was an OR. They would have [made me supreme overlord](http://www.reddit.com/r/RaidersPinnacle/comments/1i9afe/invasion_the_orangered_armies_march/cb2pe9h) for that skirmish. But NEVER. Periwinkle blue is where I belong.

Better luck next time

*Ranged* units are best represented as marksmen

*Cavalry*, or even bombers are the third class. [Here is an example of a Cavalry unit](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/US_Navy_090711-N-9712C-011_Two_F-A-18_Hornets_assigned_to_Strike_Fighter_Squadron_%28VFA%29_204_and_two_F-15_Strike_Eagles_assigned_to_the_Louisiana_Air_National_Guard_159th_Fighter_Wing_fly_in_an_echelon_formation.jpg).

Just like rock, each unit is balanced to beat another.

**Infanty beats Cavalry.**   
**Cavalry beats Ranged.**   
**Ranged beats Infantry.**

In order to win

For example- if our highest-rated is Infantry and theirs is Cavalry

So

Simply put- with determination.

**UPDATE 1**: The renegade Periwinkle territory of Fort Lapis was besieged by Periwinkle Spec Ops today in an all out war. Most of the buildings and infrastructure was destroyed in the initial bombings and shellings.

---

**Update 2**: The emergency response team lead by /u/Ghost_of_onyx is leading the [**evacuation**](http://www.reddit.com/r/FortLapis/comments/1is3l2/periwinkle_ert_emergency_response_team_inbound/) effort of Periwinkle Aligned Resistance fighters against the Mutinous teritory. 

---

**Update 3**: /r/GoodMorningPeriwinkle News Has interviewed /u/Ghost_of_Onyx

&gt;There has been a series of explosive devices detonated in and around the territory... we aren't going to be pointing too many fingers until the investigation has progressed

At this point there is much speculation

**Update 3.5**: Ghost_of_Onyx also had this to say:

&gt;We also ask non-military personnel and those who are not emergency responders to stay clear of initial blast areas... prayers are welcome.

* This year

* The scores at the bottom of the screen are the team points. We get points when we use weapons (sticks, etc.) against the orangered team. We lose points when someone from **either** team uses a weapon against us. That includes us - so watch out for friendly fire.

* The weapons mess up the text of people's comments in a variety of ways.  You'll start to see the patterns after a time.

* *Edit: [Definitive Item List](http://www.reddit.com/r/periwinkle/comments/1bflvs/definitive_item_list/)*

* Hats are hats. They appear over your username. They do not give us points. But some of them look pretty cool.

* The servers have been slammed

* There are orangered spies about trying to deceive us. Do not believe their lies. They are also attacking are most informational posts. Panpipes can be used to counter the effects of weapons.

* Edit: as per [the new addendum to the rules here](http://www.reddit.com/r/FieldOfKarmicGlory/comments/1beq5p/the_rules_of_battle/)

Please Read.",tiercel,29,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/periwinkle/comments/1j02zs/official_the_state_of_fort_lapis_and_an_official/, the impasse we are currently at offers me no solution I can help achieve with my words. So

As we were waged in a brutal, because all enemy activity was known to be in Nordwalder. It was not until the radio reports from Good Morning Periwinkle started coming in, describing carnage in that land, that we realized the folly of our assumptions. The land of Fort Lapis has been lightly settled for some time, and often found cause to be diplomatically difficult, but was still a firm part of the Periwinkle Kingdom. It's Governor, /u/spiffersthegreat, and his Lt Governor

That all changed this past Sunday afternoon. Due to some earlier trade reports that showed some missing arms shipments into Nordwalder, the Governor, who was supposed to be present, had an engagement come up, and had to delay the meeting. In this delay, the mansion fell prey to a well-placed bomb blast. Satellite imagery shows that the bomb originated from deep within the mansion, not the exterior. This bomb was cleared through security, who had “miraculously” escaped harm though convenient timing, since diplomats were also in town and staying at the Hotel)

The Governor, since no known contact with him can be verified during that time, and it is assumed he was assassinated in a consolidation of power before the land went diplomatically quiet. The growth of the PRP in Fort Lapis had spread like a cancer, and it was being fueled by the one man who could have prevented all of this. Spiffers had not only gone rogue, but he had built an army to carry out his twisted ideas.

It was several hours and many more targeted blasts, as there were many innocents caught in the crossfire of these acts. While our forces established a perimeter around the city, inside those NPP agents not already extinguished took up arms, along with sympathetic Periwinkle guardsmen and volunteers, and fought back against the insurgents whom had effectively cut off the land and taken it under their control. It was the assurances of Spiffers, the Governor, which delayed action into the city, that being the rise of the PRP

While the time from that point has been filled with my own constant attempts to get through to a man I once considered a friend, and [as this final missive from Spiffers to myself shows, the time for talk is now over.](http://imgur.com/Zjx1gTd)

Our intel shows further atrocities being perpetrated in the city now, assassinations, and interrogations. There are bodies piling up in the streets. There are systematic roundups being conducted for those who cannot escape. There are too few left to rebel inside the city. We must change the narrative of this horror.

I have assigned for a Special Force to be formed to carry out the operation of rescue, the time for talk is done. We urge those holding out there to continue resisting, and know that help is now being brought into that land. After this press release hits the airwaves, that Task Force, Strike Force: Vinca, will be making their way into the city. May the Holy Light of Periwinkle go with them, for their mission is one I'd never have thought possible for me to give... taking up arms against Periwinkles

I will follow up with the Kingdom once this operation goes into effect. We will succeed

I say we put an end to this madness! 

Come, dictated to us by those above, but by the sacred bonds we have developed since time began! This battle has caused the loss of many once fruitful lives and shattered those of the innocent. We have torn brothers from their sisters arms and pitted them against eachother in what scholars, years from now, will look on with pity.

There must be some among you of the same mind. We cannot leave a land, come my brothers and sisters! Lay down your arms and fashionable hats! Put an end to this madness, because someone has to. Someone's got to take a stand, and refuse to fight.
