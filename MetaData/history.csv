Tomorrow, I'll be returning it to his great-great-granddaughter Susan. I didn't even keep the cash. Crazy cool story inside, lots of pictures.",random_treasures,1813,113

I'm a collector of [things that are awesome.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/insignificantnobody/sets)  A few months ago, which specializes in Civil War memorabilia.  I'm from California, so it's all pretty new to me-- I'm like a kid in a candy store.  Off in a corner (where, in my experience, the best of things are usually waiting to be rediscovered) there was an [old wallet, containing a set of Civil War documents](http://www.flickr.com/photos/insignificantnobody/sets/72157632278087814/detail/) pertaining to a man named John L. Coleman, a Confederate agent during the war.  It wasn't cheap, and I realized I'd be furious at myself if I failed to buy the set for [my collection.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/insignificantnobody/)  And so

My favorite collectibles are often the things that come with badass stories.  Assuming an 150-year-old wallet of a Civil War Confederate agent would make for a fairly interesting story on its own, J. D. Tisdale.  Crazy!  So  I started to ponder... wouldn't it be interesting to track down this guy's family and blow their minds?  Yer damn skippy, it would!   If [roland19d](http://www.reddit.com/user/roland19d) hadn't put that effort in, none of this would have happened.  I don't wanna get all meta here, but people like him are why Reddit is neat.  I took the head start he gave me and passed the info to a professional genealogist with the instructions to find me a living descendant-- ideally one who isn't gonna hear this and be all ""Cool story, bro.""


A few weeks later, who then passed it on to his own son.  They still have John's old furniture, copies of his brother's will, documents freeing his slaves, and gobs of other stuff they've been diligently accumulating for most of their lives.   Judith even has his bed in her guest room!  These are *exactly* the people I wanted to find, so I was utterly overjoyed.


What they don't have,  [West View](http://www.flickr.com/photos/insignificantnobody/8505116391/in/photostream)-- the family estate in Lunenberg, VA-- was broken into and thoroughly looted.  West View belonged to [Audie Coleman](http://www.flickr.com/photos/insignificantnobody/8505366226/in/photostream), John Coleman's granddaughter, a recluse who may have been [just a little bit crazy.(Bonus kitten!)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/insignificantnobody/8505365876/in/photostream)  She was often seen toting a shotgun around the property and sometimes used it to greet visitors.  Later in life, she locked herself away in one building on the family's 500 acre estate where she lived without running water or electricity; everything she didn't need was stored in one of the two main houses.  Susan's family was very close to ""Aunt Audie""; Susan remembers vacationing at West View as a child.  Judith's mother Irma cared for Audie in her later years and subsequently [inherited all of Audie's possessions](http://www.flickr.com/photos/insignificantnobody/8504273929/in/photostream) when Audie died in 1967.  

So anyway, including many of John's belongings and documents.  The family ultimately recovered a few muskets, but none of John's documents were ever found.  

Until now.

Wow.  I love a great story, not really.  It belongs to John's family.  In Judith's guest room, she still has the bed John made with his own two hands.  They have muskets that belonged to his son John Jr.. They have a ton of other info on this guy, they live and breathe John Lewis Coleman. Yet here I am, holding this wallet filled with Confederate cash and irreplaceable documents that were stolen from their dear old Aunt Audie 45 years ago.  

I'm of the opinion that things that are old often have interesting stories behind them.  It's that story that makes collectibles compelling to me.  I was looking for that story when I began this little escapade, and they're nuts about John.  I have [John's picture.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/insignificantnobody/8500907775/in/set-72157632278087814)  I've learned an amazing amount of information about him and his family in the process.  Clearly, I got the story I was looking for... and more.  It's not just a lost wallet story, it's *THE* lost wallet story.  As I learn about the wallet and the family, I get a bit of a sinking feeling, because I know deep down that there's only one way I can give this story a satisfactory conclusion.  I have to give it back. 

So, this cache of documents is getting overnighted to Susan and Judith in Greenville, North Carolina.  I took the liberty of bringing in some local media, this being an amazing human interest story.  It looks like there will be a piece about this on WITN, WNCT, and in the Daily Reflector of Greenville.  Ideally, they're gonna be there to film Judith and Susan's happy awesomefaces as they open the package on Wednesday morning, since I live in California and won't be able to witness any of it.  

I'm giving up something precious and irreplaceable

Since you've read this far, but that's ok; they wouldn't read it anyway.  You, on the other hand, are just the kind of discerning individual who'd like to know all about that time Rosser and his dad hunted down a raccoon on the Sabbath.  Don't worry, you have my solemn promise that the dogs don't die at the end of this one.  The raccoon doesn't fare so well.

TL;DR:  I found a 150 year old wallet belonging to a Confederate agent in the Civil War named John Lewis Coleman Sr..  It was stolen from his family 45 years ago.  I'm returning it to his living descendants

Here are some of the things we learned from this amazing experience:

 1. The subject can not move while the photo is being taken, a person could quickly walk past the camera and it wouldn't affect the photo.
 2. Metal brackets were attached to the subject's head from behind to prevent movement. This did not feel comfortable to me
 3. Parents often drugged their children to insure they wouldn't fidget. Also
 4. The processing of  the wet-plate involved many harmful and flammable chemicals. Photographers had to be diligent. 

I hope that if you're ever given the opportunity to experience this you'll go for it. Cost us $70 at Victorian Photography Studio. Thank you!

One more was when he was in a fox hole, but luckily the bomb was further away than it looked he said. I couldn't imagine sitting there and watching that.

When I come here to this reddit, Buddhist shrines in Afghanistan, Abraham Lincoln, Spanish Armada, the dietary habits of Romans, or what have you.

We all rant here about the history channel showing things about Alien visitation, and other things, and it's valid here too.  Many of us read this reddit as an aggregate of websites and discussions on history.   Everything from someone showing off a really cool minature of a Roman centurion and pictures of uniforms from an Osprey book, to reviews of books, discussions on events, questions answered, are all wonderful and why I think many of us come here.

However, but this is not the forum to prove your theory that the Rosicrucian Zionists did it.  This is not the forum to convince us that Alien sub-contractors taught the Sumerians language.  Attempts to convince us that the wars in Iraq/Afghanistan are gigantic oligarchic Wall Street conspiracies by the Military-Industrial complex are better served somewhere else.


Mind you, you can't post that.""  However I do feel that I do have the right to ask for courtesy.  I know I can easily just click hide, and move along, but that doesn't address the larger issue, it merely hides it.  If I don't speak up and say anything it might begin to occur more and more, and eventually become more the norm and not the exception.  

As history fans, we should maintain, or at least attempt to maintain, a level of historical reasoning here.  Our links should be relatively decent, such as decently resourced wiki pages or trade publications, and not delve into blog spam and sites such as prison planet or Alex Jones.

Again, let's keep this reddit about history, and historical fact.  If you present politically charged stuff, or items of historical dubiousness such as Aliens building the pyramids, please at least try to present it as dubious material, and try to back it up and not scream ""it's fact! wake up sheeple!"" 

Thank you.

EDIT: to consolidate some of my responses in the comments

A nice discussion of this text and its cultural context can be found in Montserrat's [Sex and Society in Graeco-Roman Egypt](http://books.google.com/books?id=5RuDDZvZ4gAC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) (google books preview of the relevant section).  Cribiore, interpreting it instead as a school-boy joke: ""after learning how to phrase a letter and by practicing their skills in conventional epistles sent to their families, Apion and Epimas felt confident enough to compose a mock literary letter and addressed it to Epaphroditos, who may have been only a few benches away.""

EDIT 2: I'm quite excited to see so much interest and conversation about this Greek papyrus!  Then again, the best-documented city of the Roman period.  Lewis' [Greeks in Ptolemaic Egypt](http://www.amazon.com/Greeks-Ptolemaic-Egypt-Classics-Papyrology/dp/0970059124/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360207472&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=lewis+greeks+egypt) and [Life in Egypt Under Roman Rule](http://www.amazon.com/Egypt-under-Roman-Classics-Papyrology/dp/0788505602/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360207487&amp;sr=1-1-spell&amp;keywords=lewis+glife+in+roman+rule) cover more ground and are also quite lively, while Bowman's [Egypt After the Pharaohs](http://www.amazon.com/Egypt-After-Pharaohs-332-BC-AD/dp/0520205316/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360207738&amp;sr=1-1-spell&amp;keywords=bowmna+egpyt+after+pharaohs) is a bit denser, but quite insightful.  Finally, a shout out for the [Michigan Papyrology Collection](http://www.lib.umich.edu/papyrology-collection) (news and updates on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-University-of-Michigan-Papyrology-Collection/275678525787973)) -- groups are welcome to arrange (free) tours of the collection and anyone can view and learn about the papyri on rotating display.

From the beginning of production until WWI, Washington, DC...These pistols had no special government ordnance, inspectors or acceptance markings applied at the factory.  **This was the very first military order for the Colt 1903, a firearm which since then has played such a big part in American history.** There were over 500,000 produced from 1903-1945 and were used as General Officer pistols up until the 1970's when they were replaced by the M15.

According to the ""Colt Pocket Hammerless Automatic Pistols II"" collectors guide by Brunner

You can check the serial number on the gun (257406) with [this list of serial numbers](http://www.coltautos.com/mmnavy_ww1.htm) of the 200 Navy contract pistols to verify that it is indeed on that list.

Dearest father! The division is cannibalised for the great fight, it is the last time to do so. You are colonel, dear father, and part of the general staff. You know what it means, and it means you save me the explanations which might sound sentimental. It is over. I think it will take around eight days, then it is definitely over. I do not want to search for reasons to argue for or against our situation. These arguments are no longer important and without use, but if I have to say something about it: We are not responsible for our situation, so no more harm overcomes our fatherland. The hell at the Wolga should be a warning. I ask you to not set this insight at nought. [...] And now to our current situation. Only 69 soldiers are left useful of our divison. Bleyer is alive and so is Hartlieb. The small Degen lost both arms

At last the personal affairs. You can be sure that everything will end respectably. It is a little bit early with 30 years, kiss for Gerda. Greetings for everyone else. Hand at the helmet first lieutenant ... I check out of yours.

Do you know any other foreigner invader that eventually defected to the other side?",mrsamshin,620,169,http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1kcdod/during_the_japanese_invasion_of_korea_a_samurai/

During height of Japanese invasion of Korea (Imjin War)A Japanese officer(who served under Katō Kiyomasa) defected immediately because of what he has witnessed, he joined in the Righteous Korean army; with his leadership and experience in warfare, he drove away the Japanese forces, and taught Korean soldiers how to use the arquebus (gunpowered matchlock muskets) and military tactics. (During this period, Koreans were unfamiliar with the arquebus and were poorly trained, preferring the bow and arrow, also lacking in battlefield experience and discipline.  In contrast, men already bloodied from the many campaigns of Japan's Warring States period.) The Joseon government recognized his efforts and was given the Korean name 김충선 (Chungson Kim) and the rank of general.  

After the Imjin War ended

During the Japanese colonial era in the 20th century, they considered him “half Korean and half Japanese” or just a fictional figure.  In 1930, Hidetaka Nakamura of the Japanese colonial government’s Korean History Compilation Committee conducted an investigation and confirmed that Kim Chung-seon was indeed a Japanese defector. Recently, a monument in memory of Kim was built in Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. (http://wbs-ceo.sblo.jp/article/41707035.html)

Nowadays, Nokdong Seowon, Korea remains a popular destination for Japanese tourists in Daegu.  This is the story covered by Japan's TBS TV news. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKgltTFf7HI) What's more interesting is the idea of turning the village into tourist destination for Japanese/Korean visitors for promoting peace and friendship between two countries. Kim Chungson fought for the innocent, appreciation for other cultures, and opposed a unjustified war. Despite the troubled history between Korea and Japan such as the comfort women and Dokdo issue. His story should be a lesson for all of us today. The real story of ""The Last Samurai"" and ""Dances with Wolves""

Another instance was when my grandfather was on the move, demanding to take his bike (Yes, stereotype, but this actually happened to my grandfather). My grandfather simply refused. At this point, he realized he made a mistake. He should've just handed over his bicyle and walked away. Now, he was in an argument with a German officer, demanding his bike, my grandfather would get shot. Giving in now would imply he all of a sudden had something to hide

---
My grandmother got lucky more often. It was 1944 and she was carrying food stamps in a small jar intended for marmelade. She had to cross a river using a small ferry. Just as the ferry left she noticed a group of German officers on the opposite side of the river bank, somebody all of a sudden taps her on her shoulder. It is a local police officer. She had talked to him once in a while, but never released anything on her activities in the resistance. The officer looked her in the eyes, and asked her if he could have her marmelade. Figuring this gamble is a better shot than getting apprehended and detained, she rapidly gives the police officer her jar filled with food coupons, expecting the coupons to be lost.

She gets off the ferry, basically denying everything that happened on the ferry, he walks up to her and says the following:
&gt; Excuse me madam

He hands her the jar with food stamps

---
This however is nothing compared to the dangers my great-grandparents put theirselves through. They ended up taking a Jewish family in hiding. One story I will always remember is of when one of the guests of their bed and breakfast, took the hint straight away and told the Jewish family to go and take a walk in the woods adjacent to their backyard and not come back until dawn. About an hour after the family left for their walk, the Germans knocked on their door, performing a Razzia...

You can read about my great-grandparents (Jane is my grandmother) [on this entry in The Righteous Among The Nations](http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?language=en&amp;itemId=4039355). They got awarded the Yad Vashem in 1992.

---

These people are the reason I am alive. These  people contributed to the well-being of tens of people with their heroic activities in the Resistance. They were brave people

Tomorrow is the 5th of May, trains will stop going. 

We will commemorate all those who have fallen

We will commemorate all of those who gave their lives to protect our country

We will commemorate every single Dutch victim of War.

There are a few lank spots where I couldn't make out the word. 


Gave talk to WW2 flyers: 7/12/00

Donald Baker-Bombardier and Enlisted army air force at Camp Grant Nov,some navigation practice.

In January 1944 on a practice bombing mission we lost 3 and 4 engines on fire.Couldn't put fire out so we bailed out over South Dakota. I had a problem with my chest pack and had to help flaps open to release the chute.I landed in an open prarie after some time I was picked up by a farmer in an old pickup truck.We traveled several miles to plane crash. Some of our crew were there keeping people some distance from burning plane as we had live 50 Cal and practice bombs aboard.We were all awarded the Caterpillar Club Membership and Lapel pin to go with it.

After completing combat training we picked up a new B17 G in Lincoln Nebraska.We flew to England the Northern Route. Bangor Maine

June 5 1944 on our 13th mission,000.Landed in an anti-glider field and was captured right away. I learned later from the wounded radioman that the pilot,ball gunner and tail-gunner were killed.

 
Finally taken to Stalag Luft III at Sagan about 40 miles south east of Berlin.This POW camp was onlyfor Airforce Officers

 

Camp made up of 6 compounds,000 in South compound when we left Sagan.

North compound was place of Great Escape

 
Red Cross parcels were real important to our survival. When they were available each POW got 1 approximate 10lb parcel of food each week. Each room up to 15 men pooled the food and took turns doing the cooking. One cook stove per building for 100 to 150 men so stove times were staggered.

 

Had a good library,4 cards per month)Roll call at least 2 times a day.

 
We could hear big bombs the Berlin at night. British 4,tables etc. against the fences,hoping that some could get out and overcome guards.

 
Guards were called Goons and we were called Kreigies. Last week of January 1945 we were told we had to leave Stalag Luft III because Russians were getting close.We were kind of prepared to take only clothing and food as anything we were going to take we had to carry.Started around midnight

This camp much more crowded and no parcels for awhile. German food very limited.

Last of April General Pattons 3rd Armored liberated us. Saw General Patton when he came thru our area to check things out I guess.The Army gave us fresh bread and bean soup

Flew by C47 to La Harve and got deloused

Visited 390th Bomb group Museum at Pima Air Museum in Tucson. Found out we were shot down on the 123rd of 321 missions flown by 390th. We were 1 of 2 lost on that mission.Pilot-Red Armstrong and me from Rockton.

1355454992.0,14tnob,History Podcasts out there worth our time,davidreiss666,449,86,116,"Hello there

I've been a little sick of late.  So

The standard history podcasts we all seem to mention from time to time are:

* [The History of Rome](http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/) by Mike Duncan.  He finished it about six months ago.  He ended up doing 179 parts that detailed Roman History from the founding of the city to the fall of the Western Empire in 476 AD.    This is something I normally tell people is the best podcast in on the Internet.  
* [12 Byzantine Rulers](http://12byzantinerulers.com/) by Lars Brownworth which is about Byzantine history.  It was the podcast that gave Mike Duncan the idea to do the his History of Rome.    
* [Norman Centuries](http://normancenturies.com/) is another podcast from Brownworth.   It's been ongoing for the last three years
* [Hardcore History](http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hh) by Dan Carlin is also a highly thought of by most people.   It comes out in longer formats (90-120 minutes normally)
* [In our Time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/iot) with Melvyn Bragg is a BBC radio show that lends itself to the podcast format very nicely. 

There seem to be several podcasts that took their cue from Mike Duncan's History of Rome and are trying to do their own podcasts. 

* [British History Podcast](http://thebritishhistorypodcast.com/)  by Jamie Jeffers.  So far he is 79 episodes in. 
* [The Ancient World](http://ancientworldpodcast.blogspot.com/) by Scott Chesworth, and has completed 17 so far. 
* [The History of Byzantium](http://thehistoryofbyzantium.wordpress.com/) by Robin Pierson

So, and hopefully people know of good podcasts that cover India, Chinese, South East Asia, and African history, as well as those topics closely related to history like Archaeology, Linguistics

Dear people: 

I'm told that you were probably never informed that I was anything other than ""missing in action."" Chances are that you also failed to receive any of the letters I wrote from Germany. That leaves me a lot of explaining to do -- in precis: 

I've been a prisoner of war since December 19th, food and medical supplies gave out and our casualties out-numbered those who could still fight - so we gave up. The 106th got a Presidential Citation and some British Decoration from Montgomery for it, I'm told, but I'll be damned if it was worth it. I was one of the few who weren't wounded. For that much thank God. 

Well, water or sleep to Limberg, a distance of about sixty miles, I think, where we were loaded and locked up, sixty men to each small, unventilated, including Christmas
 
Under the Geneva Convention, a Private. One-hundred-and-fifty such minor beings were shipped to a Dresden work camp on January 10th. I was their leader by virtue of the little German I spoke. It was our misfortune to have sadistic and fanatical guards. We were refused medical attention and clothing: We were given long hours at extremely hard labor. Our food ration was two-hundred-and-fifty grams of black bread and one pint of unseasoned potato soup each day. After desperately trying to improve our situation for two months and having been met with bland smiles I told the guards just what I was going to do to them when the Russians came. They beat me up a little. I was fired as group leader. Beatings were very small time: -- one boy starved to death and the SS Troops shot two for stealing food. 

On about February 14th the Americans came over

After that we were put to work carrying corpses from Air-Raid shelters; women, fire or suffocation. Civilians cursed us and threw rocks as we carried bodies to huge funeral pyres in the city. 

When General Patton took Leipzig we were evacuated on foot to ('the Saxony-Czechoslovakian border'?). There we remained until the war ended. Our guards deserted us. On that happy day the Russians were intent on mopping up isolated outlaw resistance in our sector. Their planes (P-39's) strafed and bombed us

Eight of us stole a team and wagon. We traveled and looted our way through Sudetenland and Saxony for eight days

I'm writing from a Red Cross Club in the Le Havre P.O.W. Repatriation Camp. I'm being wonderfully well feed and entertained. The state-bound ships are jammed, about $600 back pay and -- get this -- sixty (60) days furlough. 

I've too damned much to say

May 29

His name is Luther Smith
He was in the 8th AF stationed in Grafton-Underwood, restricting his oxygen. It was easy to get lightheaded and pass out while he was curled up alone in the tiny space around the machine gun, and he had to be careful to break the ice often and not lose his concentration.

He flew numerous missions over Germany

Smitty was shot in the hand by enemy gunfire as his crew was preparing to parachute from the falling plane. He right hand was entirely useless

They landed in a field and were immediately greeted by German soldiers. Smitty's crew was led to a POW camp

The Germans wanted to keep moral up in the camp, was asked to join in, and did so reluctantly. He used to play the guitar before the war, but wasn't able to do so with his now missing right hand. The Germans matched him up with another prisoner who was missing his left hand, and gave them a skit where they played the guitar together.
Smitty showed me a photo of the group that participated in the skit. There were about twenty men in ridiculous costumes

He was reluctant to say anything else about his experience as a prisoner

When he was released and sent back to America

Smitty told me his story in six hours. They were the six fastest hours of my life. I've never been more inspired and awed. I think he is the bravest and most humble man I've ever met.

**The frequency of urban combat**

Pitched battles are usually very rare in the history of ancient warfare. Such battles require that two opposing armies both want to fight each other in the same place at the same time. If the armies are distant or one side doesn't see the benefit of fighting

Greeks generally preferred to avoid urban combat at all costs for several reasons. For one, which upset the traditional hierarchy of ancient Greece. Houses were supposed to be a secure private space, not a battleground. Urban battlefields favored the poorer, lightly armed, and largely unarmored troops in the army, upsetting the hoplite's dominance of warfare. To top it all off, urban battles were brutal, and uncertain.

Still, and also because the city was so important in inter-state warfare in Greece. However it's not mentioned nearly as much in classical sources because the Greeks simply preferred to think of warfare in terms of pitched field battles, which were more ""honorable"", easier to romanticize, and easier to prepare for.

Once a city's walls were breached in a siege, good job, you got us!"" Sometimes the defending force would surrender, retreat, or just fall apart if they were surprised, demoralized, or starved into submission. Other times they'd fight on in the streets. This would frequently involve struggles for a few strategic points, and house-to-house fighting in the most desperate battles. Additionally

**Walls**

Most *polis* in ancient Greece included a walled city surrounded by farms, but by the Hellenistic era they would be pretty magnificent. Controlling gates was very important for prolonged urban battles because whoever had the gate could allow reinforcements in and prevent enemies from escaping.

Building walls was something that the whole city would do. It was a major undertaking that the city's rulers would organize and the bulk of the population would participate in or support in some way. Walls became a symbol of a city's unity, and autonomy. The presence of an enemy force within the walls could easily cause the population of a city to absolutely panic. Defenders would almost *never* choose to abandon their walls and fight within the city unless they absolutely had to.

**Strategic points**

Most cities had a central acropolis, and other such important facilities. The acropolis could be used as a fortress within the city for holding up or preparing counterattacks. Markets (*agora*) were also major city centers where people would gather to do more than just trade. Markets were always located near the city's center at the junction of at least two major roads within the city. Important administrative buildings could be located within the market, too. The market was usually the rallying point of defenders and the goal of attackers. Controlling the market usually (but not always) meant controlling the city.

Other important areas within a city were based on what allowed large masses of troops to assemble and form up for attacks or counterattacks. Theaters, and warehouses could all serve this purpose. Sometimes a losing faction in urban combat would try to turn these areas into fortresses, using barricades and digging trenches. Sometimes it worked, other times they became deathtraps.

**Roads**

Older cities had irregular

Newer cities and cities that had seen major expansion since the mid-fifth century usually employed systems of straight

**Houses**

Homes faced inwards, mud brick walls, and pitched, tiled roofs. Homes in older cities were small and irregularly laid out. In grid-planned cities, houses were usually built in small complexes surrounded by common walls, perhaps with alleyways between them. Either way, houses were a massive pain for attackers. They could serve as a series of mutually-supporting micro-fortifications. By cutting holes in walls and barricading certain entryways, since every room could potentially hold a desperate defender

**Tactics**

Typical battlefield formations were useless in urban fighting. Commanders could draw up a phalanx in certain areas such as a market place or wide roads, duck into houses, and otherwise navigate the urban landscape, but when you're coming through a doorway in a house protected by dedicated defenders you want all the armor you can get.

Heavier hoplites would act as assault troops within a city, holding strategic points, and assaulting defended buildings. Poorer troops with lighter gear, including some lightly-armored hoplites and dedicated light infantry, would act as skirmishers. They could better maneuver in the urban environment to get around obstacles and attack from unexpected positions, including from rooftops. Never forget that urban combat is three-dimensional. Fighting from a rooftop with missile weapons gave a much more decisive advantage than fighting from a hilltop. cavalry is rarely mentioned in sources on ancient urban warfare. This could be because cavalry was almost useless in such cases or simply because the Greeks didn't use much cavalry to begin with.

Defenders could block off streets with barricades and trenches. They could also demolish smaller buildings, loose tiles, tools laying around in the market, and various household items could be used to equip local residents as skirmishers. Phyrrus, the famous king of Epirus, general who bested Rome in pitched battle, and would-be king of Macedon

It might be difficult for attackers to maintain discipline during urban combat. After all, or temples, there's just so much stuff lying around for a soldier to get distracted by, not to mention some of the first women a soldier might have seen in a little while... There are a few records of attackers being routed after a counterattack was mounted simply because they were too busy raping and pillaging to effectively defend themselves.

My most common answer, every news story i hear, absolutely everything- dinner conversation, online chatting in forums, you name it. Whereas many of my friends who are engineers have paid thousands of dollars in school for information that they will almost never use outside of an office/lab, (at least, not outside of work discussion)


*edit*: since some people are just far to sensitive and completely stupid to see what i mean here, etc. do their job just for money
I do NOT believe that even most of them do (see how i used the word ""many""? Cool
I do NOT believe that teachers made tons of money, i'm well-aware of their incomes).

I DO believe that going to school for education, (Jobs = money, whether a lot or not much at all, it's still money) than is an undergraduate degree in History by itself.

The counter arguments appear to be

* Europe dominated because of its superior culture
* Europe has/had an imperialistic culture
* Political determinism (sub set of Culture IMHO)
* Technology determinism (sub set of Culture IMHO)
* History is more tangled and random

I'm open to hear counter ideas. But I do see things that seem to imply geography

I hear some criticism that his ideas on germ transfer are wrong and that diseases did not transfer to Europe due to the oceanic journey being too long for virulent dangerous diseases to make the journey. This counters only the detail but maintains the overall theory of geographic determinism.

1304471811.0,h3maj,Hey History Reddit. I found some old photos from WW2 at a Garage Sale this past weekend. I scanned and uploaded them just for you! ,1ilypad,342,51,38,"Hey history reddit! I have a treat for you today! 


On Saturday I went out to a garage sale that an older couple in suburban South-Western Ohio had open. As I sorted though the mass of random household goods and clothes

They had a few artifacts from WW2 laying in plastic storage bags.. Mostly Pictures

From what she told me he was in Air Force during the War and served as a crew member abroad a B-29. He was stationed in Florida, both matte and glossy, that had from what I could tell 30 photos. The second was a smaller storage bag of German stamps, I could see a blue Hitler staring at me from below. The next was another bag with a Nazi lapel pin, or hat pin, I’m not entirely sure which it is.  The last was a set of prayer cards and random ads from 1941.

So I buy the lot for roughly $15, the pack was obviously French, with a English insert for English speaking soldiers. The second was a set of six glossy photos of from an Air Force command training center in Miami, Fla. They look personal, but I’m not sure. The third set was a set of monument photos with descriptions in both French and German.

 I upload a few of the photos and check if I can find another source of them online with Tin Eye. A few I have

Should I save these and hide them away in vacuum sealed bags and away from the sun or is there somewhere I should donate them for preservation? They are all quite old and I don’t have the resources to maintain them forever. I am not even too sure of their real historical value. So help there would be cool.

So here are the albums of the 30 or so photos that I have uploaded. I hope you guys and girls enjoy them!!! If you would like to see the Pin

**TLDR:**
I went to a garage sale and found some amazing old photos and memorabilia that a US Air Force soldier brought home after World War 2. I scanned and uploaded the three sets of photos I found. I hope you enjoy!

I would also like to point out the [r/History Reading list](http://jottit.com/fyrxb/) -- and you should be able to edit it.    Please though

Also, and I should have added this most fine example of a good Redditor as a mod 2.5 months back during the events of the  [Great History Modding](http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/fiukn/let_us_sit_down_and_have_a_discussion_about_what/).

Next

I am still not sure how we got drafted into that.   But as a user I frequent several parts of the Depthhub

And that leads me to bringing up the Sidebar

There are a lot of smaller subreddits listed there.  Places, please [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23history) and if it truly applicable to history or a closely related topic, one of us will add it.

I am looking for rather specific examples of what he did that justifies those particular views, I hope that I am being clear enough.

A lot of it is a laundry list of buildings he worked on or built

&gt;Military record of J.P.Kennedy. Enlisted in the National in Co. D. 13th regt. in aug. 1875. Was appointed Let. Seargt early in 1876. Camped in philadelphia for two weeks in aug 1876 at the centennial celebration.

&gt;Served as 1st Seargt in the Railroad riots in pittsburgh in p 1877. for 35 days. This co. mustered out in 1882.

&gt;Organized Co.D Fifth regt. N.G.P. in Blairsville in 1887. was elected Capt.. Had the Honor when the H.G was called to suppress the Mob in 1892 at homestead to command the advance on and disperse the rioters. This was the great Homestead strike.

&gt;Was Promoted to Major of the Fifth regt. in 1893. Commanded the first Batt. of the Fifth regt. In the Punxuutawney coal strike of 1894 

&gt;Volunteered os Major of the Fifth Penna. Volunteers for the war with Spain. Sworn in april 27th 1898. Musteres out Nov. 11th

&gt;Commanded his Battalion in the Grand review in Philad. at close of the Spanish-American War.

&gt;This ended my Military service to the State and Nation.

I'm kind of shocked that I would have an ancestor who was directly involved in some of the most notorious labour disputes in American history; it's like he had a front-row seat for the Gilded Age.

The other

&gt;On the 19th of July the great r.r. strike occurred and there were great riots in several places but Pittsburgh was the worst anI with my brotherinlaw John.A.Mc.Kesson we went with the company almost a month.

&gt;In 1892 we had the Homestead Riots when the writer served in the same for a period of 32 days.

&gt;On the 15th of feb. 1898, being mustered out on the 11th day of november of 1898.

As for the laundry list of buildings, businesses et.al.), but there was one that stuck out:

 *Andrew Carnegie's summer home*

&gt;In the spring [of 1885] we got a contract to build a cottage for David Stewart of Pbgh. at the then summer resort of Cresson. In went on the Job and had the work done. Stewart was one of Carnegies partners in the steel business

It's one of those weird coincidences of history; a carpenter who worked on Carnegie's summer home was also one of the National Guard captains who helped suppress some of the biggest labour disputes in American history.

There's other stuff too, and his multiple attempts to volunteer for WWI (he was turned away for being too old).

Hope you enjoy!

A horrific detail from the WWI battle of Passchendale,hexag1,285,71,92,"I came across this horrific story while reading Adam Hochschild's excellent history of WW I **To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion**. Actually, and I highly recommend it. 

In one chapter Hochschild tells of the disaster at Passchendale. I summarize


This was a brutal battle, Indians, and Canadians) launched an assault against the German lines beginning July 17, 1917. While the battle was scheduled to be only a few days, it turned into several months. British forces would begin with a barrage of artillery shelling from in front of the enemy lines, then aiming farther back to cover the lines and the area behind them. Then soldiers would march forward, cutting barbed wire and enduring return shelling from the Germans. If all went well

However, but after the artillery assault and return fire from the Germans, the land between the lines was cratered like the moon. Meanwhile, it had begun to rain.

The rain, horses and equipment became stuck in the mud. From the book:

&gt;""I cannot attempt to describe the conditions under which we are fighting, in reality, be miles below the truth.... The mud is not so much mud as a fathomless, sticky morass. The shell holes, where they do not actually merge into one another, are divided only by a few inches of this glutinous mud.... The gunners work thigh-deep in water."" Some British artillery pieces dug themselves so deeply into the mud with their recoils that they dropped below the surface; the crew would then put up a flag to mark the spot.""

Injured men would crawl into shell craters to shield themselves from gunfire

&gt;Private Charlie Miles of the Royal Fusiliers carried messages as a runner—a misnomer in this season: ""The moment you set off you felt that dreadful suction.... In a way, and it would grunt all the air out.... The smell could make you vomit."" And when shells landed, they blasted waterlogged, putrefying corpses into the air, showering pieces of them down on the soldiers who were still alive.

Meanwhile

&gt;British, ""Our Position Improved; Heroism in the New Advance"" (the Times); ""Complete Success in Battle of the Pill Boxes; Haig's Smashing Blow"" (the Daily Mirror).
&gt;In the sanitizing language of newspapers and memorial services, were referred to as the ""fallen."" But in the mud of Passchendaele, falling dead from a bullet wound was only for the lucky:*""A party of 'A' Company men passing up to the front line found ... a man bogged to above the knees,""* remembered Major C. A. Bill of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. *""The united efforts of four of them, with rifles beneath his armpits, made not the slightest impression, and to dig, would be impossible,False,

1334140815.0,s45cr,Misconception on the Vietnam War. ,mnbvlkjhpoiu,279,73,262,"It always surprises me that most of the Western World views the Vietnam War as the war between Vietnam and the US. My impression is that the general opinion on the matter usually surrounds how the US should not have been in Vietnam in the first place and Vietnam was relieved to be reunified. The Vietnamese communists are portrayed in a positive light while the US and South Vietnam are not.
I admit that I'm a little bit biased because of my family history but hopefully I can offer a different POV into the Vietnam war so everyone out there would know that not all Vietnamese are happy with the reunification process.

My mom's family was originally from North Vietnam but they were small business owners so they were considered to be bourgeois by the Communists, her family emigrated to the south to escape persecution from the communists. My paternal grandparents were small landowners who were brought to trials by the communists but thanks to the villagers who testified for them, they escaped punishment and eventually moved down South. According to my parents, South Vietnam enjoyed relative freedom and prosperity due to the presence of American culture and products. Even though many people would say that the regime of Ngo Dinh Diem (South Vietnam's first president) was full of repression, my parents would say that it was the most stable period of the South Vietnam's relatively short life because the country was relatively safe from the North's attacks due to his strict policies toward communists. Freedom wise, people went on protests and were able to criticize the government openly. However, his regime was only viewed negatively by the American public and the world since with the presence of the American press in the south, what's going on in the north is heavily shielded from public awareness, they still had the privilege of cinemas

I do not deny the fact that South Vietnam was full of corrupted and incompetent leaders but I want to emphasize that we did not welcome or rejoice the presence of North Vietnamese Liberation Army in the South. If we did, getting lost at sea, or being arrested by the Vietnamese communist soldiers and being put in jails. The war ended around the time my dad was getting ready for his college applications. He was barred from attending college for several years due to discrimination against his family history (he had two brothers who were drafted into the South Vietnam Army, who were then put in reconcentration camp, i.e a form of prison for ex South VN soldiers, and who came back with no teeth and had to face discrimination when applying for jobs). My parents spent their early 20s being malnourished from the lack of food (just like North Korea today) and being deprived of every privilege that I now get to enjoy. In Vietnam nowadays, if anyone ever makes any statement on sensitive issues concerning the lack of freedom or government policies

A lot of people are surprised at the fact that there is a large Vietnamese population in the US (because Vietnamese supposedly hate the US for invading their country). I want to clarify that this population is mostly composed of South Vietnamese refugees, Ho Chi Minh, originally petitioned to Woodrow Wilson to help in the Vietnamese revolution against the French colonization. Wilson was not interested so Ho Chi Minh turned to communist Russia for assistance instead and his ideology became radical then. A lot of South Vietnam people however felt a little bit betrayed by the US's sudden withdrawal of troops, which left South Vietnam in a defenseless state (thanks to the South Vietnam incompetent army leaders) against North Vietnam+China+USSR. Most of the South Vietnamese do not hate the US and we feel grateful that the US offered us a safe haven over here so we could start our community all over. In California, the only Vietnam flag that can be seen is the old South Vietnam flag (before the end of the war). If the current Communist Vietnamese flag is ever raised for any reason, the Vietnamese community would gather together to stage a protest until the flag is taken down. Some people think that we are pathetic for losing the war to the North and not being able to fight for our country back. However, I do hope with time
