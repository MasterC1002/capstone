Seven hundred eighty-nine at the moment. Made by me

They're black and white, paint-overs, whatever. The six colour ones at the start of the imgur album are a five minute scribble-job to show the kind of thing I'd expect people to do to them.

If you want to use them for your game, so do let me know if you make something cool with them. 

If they'd be perfect but you really need an icon of a bunch of electrified grapes or a hell-walrus

I don't have my own web hosting but here's [a zip file containing a high-resolution image of each individual icon](http://www.sendspace.com/file/k7njh1) on sendspace.

So you guys might know me from /r/gamedev where I recently made a post about [Black Annex](http://www.blackannex.net) which is a game I've spent the past year creating in QBASIC and just announced to the world the other day. (Btw, Mac and Linux. This is probably the MAIN thing I got asked in my last post)

In brief, Syndicate style game with some fun-to-mess-with AI and little aspects of hacking, espionage and stealth. It's been a year of arguing with QBASIC to get the whole thing to actually exist in a playable state but it's finally something that I think some people would actually enjoy playing!

Anyway

I hope you guys like the look of Black Annex!

Just to be quick here and to stop some of the lesser quality posts:



**1) No ""reminder"" posts for crowd-supported projects (Kickstarter/IndieGoGo/Greenlight)


This one is from /r/games. I think it could help the constant spam of projects.





**2) No ""XXX/YYY is finally released/announced/updated"" posts unless they come directly from the dev/store/whatever site.**

Lots of people are using this to get hits to their site, don't do it.

So what's ok? Let's say Terry Cavanagh releases ZZZZZZ. Post the link from his site

Also

Just please



**3) No ""general"" URL shorteners (bit.ly

Don't do this



**4) And for the love of IndieGaming


That's pretty much it. Thanks everyone for your time and keep submitting cool and new stuff.

PD: Please help me enforce these rules by reporting and posts and if you have some time

I thought you might be interested in my journey from someone who literally knows **nothing** about programming to a published game developer. I know that this type of post would have been really helpful for me when was just getting started. Hopefully I can inspire someone in a similar situation!

**THE STORY**

About a year and a half ago

I always thought it would be pretty sweet to be a game developer but it was so out of reach that it never felt like a realistic goal. But one day in October of 2010 I just decided to go for it. I had nothing to lose so why not?

I learned bits and pieces of a bunch of languages, ActionScript, and Objective-C. Honestly though, I really don’t think it matters too much what languages you learn on. If there is one piece of advice that I can share about learning to program, it is this: **PROGRAM A LOT**. There really is no other way to learn besides doing, doing, doing, and doing again. Every time you make something new

Along the way I made a ton of stupid

* [A game about a man-rodent](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/dtplj/thought_you_might_be_interested_in_my_very_first/) hiding in a town
* [A text-based minesweeper clone]( http://youtu.be/Cn_Oibc4sjg) with a custom-sized board and mine-count
* [A game called Pizza Guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HLumD97DX8)
* [A game called Party Man](http://www.whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/1000000423.png), so he kept literally crashing the party.
* [An app where you could create sequences of musical phrases](http://youtu.be/xWMsBGEwvbY) in the pentatonic scale
* [A flash clone of the classic snake game](http://whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/Racer.swf)
* [A flash clone of those driving-through-an-ever-shrinking-tunnel games](http://whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/Racer.swf)

Finally,” as if there were one way to make a game. But I realized I just need to make it however I could, even if it wasn’t necessarily the right or best way.

When I sent the game to beta testers, then I’m done!” a thousand times.

Submitting to the app store was terrifying. I was so paranoid that I would forget something huge. Something that could break the game or get it rejected. But at the same time, was done. I went from not knowing a thing about programming to finishing a game that I was very very proud of.

It’s already gotten some awesome previews on [Touch Arcade](http://toucharcade.com/2012/04/19/hands-on-with-whitaker-trebellas-polymer/)

Of course, programming Polymer has taught me so many amazing things. There’s a lot of really messy spaghetti code, but I honestly don’t care too much because it works. Next time I make a game I’ll be able to build upon what I’ve learned, and hopefully make something even more awesome. Until then though, I’m hoping for the best with Polymer. And I hope you enjoy it!

**TLDR:**

* A year and a half ago

* Today my first game

* I did all the programming

* It's 50% off for launch!

Since it's just launched, it’s all yours - let me know which one in the comments, so we know how many are left.

Second off, be the first to unlock one of the more fiendish achievements, we send you a trophy! You can also win a trophy by making the coolest level submitted to the Steam Workshop (there’s a level editor). [Competition info is here.](http://www.colourbind.com/blog/colour-bind-competition/)

So that's it! The game's real hard


**Edit:** Sorry for the duplicate error codes and whatnot - I'm striking through as fast as I can

**Second edit:** It looks like all the codes are just about gone - if you want to pick through the unstruckthrough ones

**More keys!** Okay so since those went pretty quickly

**Third Edit:** The text codes were all taken and taking up lots of space

**Fourth Edit:** It looks like that recent batch of 100 are just about done. I might, an amazingly fabulous reddit alien level was posted by my friend over in the [thread at /r/gaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/10h33y/i_just_released_my_first_indie_game_on_steam). If you've got the game, you can get the level on Steam Workshop. :)

**Fifth edit:** I cross-posted this to /r/gaming

**Holy crap this is a lot of edits:** Here are [another 100 Steam codes](http://imgur.com/Q3mcS) - have at it!

**Seventh edit:** I didn't know about the one hour lockout thing that Steam does

**Edit the eighth:** I need to get some breakfast (Australia time)

**And in closing:** Okay guys and girls, but it seems like a decent number of keys were successfully transferred so that's pretty good. I'm massively appreciative of all the feedback and the number of people who are trying out the game now - I really hope you like it! Judging by the comments, it is my suspicion that there are a couple of valid keys left in that last batch of 200, and there might be some lurking in the other batches too, for a sufficiently patient gamer. For those who got a key, or didn't but get the game anyway, I hope you have fun!

- Iji (http://remar.se/daniel/iji.php) [Windows, and the in game humor completes it to make it well worth the four plus years it took the artist to create it, hot drinks and all.

- Cave Story (www.cavestory.org) [Windows, etc... sidescroller shooter] This wouldn't be a real list without Cave Story. Do I even need to go into detail here? Probably the most famous free indie platformer out there, it has a story, awesome music, and again, great replayability. Play it now. (Huzzah!)

- Battleships Forever (http://www.wyrdysm.com/games.php) [Windows, the most fun you can have with this is the built-in shipmaker which let's you construct your own armadas and set them against each other. Lasers, lasers everywhere!

- The Cleaner (http://sandbox.yoyogames.com/games/26070-the-cleaner) [Windows, enjoy the interesting artistic style of the game,  meet many fascinating specials of new creatures, and kill them with a unique arsenal of spells. And don't scare Spoofy.

- The Tank Game (http://sandbox.yoyogames.com/games/6777-the-tank-game) [Windows

- Amea (http://armorgames.com/play/10487/amea) [Online

- Naev (http://blog.naev.org/) [Windows, space RPG] A fairly awesome exploration and quest based space game, you make money, trade, do quests, and who could forget, fight. Not finished (meaning that updates come out occasional

- Battle Tanks II (http://download.cnet.com/BattleTanks-II/3000-2119_4-10660827.html) [Windows, capture their spawn points, and claim victory! If you enjoy it, I'd suggest looking for the expansion packs... after you get those, you can see the tank files they modified and even make you're own tanks!… No, I can't think of a single game related easter egg to say here.

- SUAVE (Sport Utility Assault Vehicle Extreme) (http://www.curlysworldoffreeware.com/games/view/482) [Windows, but nothing beats dodging about in slow-mo. “You can't hit me! You can't hit my tiny little... tank.”

- Return To Sector Nine (http://www.pugfuglygames.com/Game.php?game=10) [Windows, weapons, and medals! And kill those space bugs over, and over, and over...

- Phosphor (http://www2.rasterwerks.com/game/phosphor/beta2.asp) [Windows, I don't know if this needs to be on here, but hey. Nothing exciting graphically but it is fun in it's own way.

- Legend Of Johnny (http://www.maxgames.com/play/legend-of-johnny.html) [Online

- Mud and Blood (http://www.mudandblood.net/mudandbloodz.html) [Online, a medic, or an air strike?

- Avert Fate (http://unity3d.com/gallery/live-demos/avert-fate) [Windows, well here you are. It *does* have good graphics. Unfortunately it's just a tech demo, but that doesn't stop it from being a fun fifteen minutes.

- Black Shades (http://www.wolfire.com/black-shades) [Windows

- Assassin Blue (http://sandbox.yoyogames.com/games/44391-assassin-blue) [Windows, and you wear a hat. This is important later. Like most of the sidescrollers here, the graphics are oldschool, but that's how it's meant to be. And if you don't like that, what are you doing looking at this list? Get back to the store!

- Deep Magic (http://sandbox.yoyogames.com/games/127-deep-magic) [Windows, but I never really got around to it...


That's it for me. At least four years of searching and playing is above this. I hope at least one of those is enjoyable to you, if you need any hints... feel free. Some of those can be frustrating) Have fun!

So if you have any feedback

Also check out the Facebook page for future news on Chester and my next project: http://www.facebook.com/BrilliantBlueG

**Update:** My intention with this was for the game to be free to own if you got it in the 48 hours

If it ends up that it isn't being tied to your accounts

**Update 2:** Wow

**Update 3:**  Looks like you'll be able to play the game as long as you leave it installed
Once the 48 hours ends I'll be putting it back on a 90% sale for people that want to buy it for $1 and work on setting up a page for people to get a key if they want a free install.

* Fully 3D maps where attacks can come from any angle
* Ambient electronic soundtrack and abstract visuals which create an atmospheric

Hey everyone

I think a great place to start would be [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ5mt1pMuaI).  While I don't care much for the ""Lets compare this game to that game"", but it showcases a lot of the major features.  In this video LastGreyWolf uses a phrase that I think sums up Starbound perfectly; ""Next fucking level"".  

The largest source of information currently would most likely have to be the [List of Announced Game Information](http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?threads/list-of-announced-game-information-updated-april-3.450/) post on the official forums.  As the title suggests

**What is Starbound about?**

I keep seeing this question pop up, has mentioned in an early interview that one of his main inspirations comes from Star Trek.  He mentioned that he wanted a sort of ""Adventure of the week"" feeling.  Going to a new planet was like an entirely new adventure.  

Better than I could ever do

**Notable Information**

One of the coolest features I think about Starbound, weather, biomes, temperature, flora, fauna, npcs, cities, not just randomly painted in.


Multiplayer will work like Neverwinter Nights.  For those unfamiliar with that, you will either be able to bring your already established character into the server, or start a new character specifically for that server (sort of like servers connected to the main hive vs private hives in DayZ).  

Starbound will allow for **heavy modding**.  Lua scripting allows for practically any change to be made, you write a configuration file - it takes two minutes, and that block is in the game. You can spawn it, you can use it, it has it's own properties etc.""  ""When you join a server that has files that you don't have, similar to source engine games, it gets those files.  So a server owner can just throw what ever they want in there

It was left at that, not a witchhunt:

------

**to /r/gaming/**

Hello!

I am an indie game developer

In the next few days

Thanks for your time!

------

**from Mod2[M]**

Hi Berick

By the looks of it your account is still incredibly lopsided in terms of promotion. Unless you right that

I would strongly read over the User Agreement before taking any action.

------

**to Mod2** (Taken from the UA. Additional emphasis my own)

**It's not strictly forbidden to submit a link to a site that you own** or otherwise benefit from in some way

If you spend more time submitting to reddit than reading it, and up / downvoting.**

If your contribution to Reddit consists mostly of submitting links to a site(s) that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way - **I can see where you could be blindly applying this to me

If people historically downvote your links - **N/A**

If people historically upvote your links [...] congratulations! It's almost certainly not spam. - **I've gotten several (granted

don't flood the new queue - **Unless you feel that once every couple weeks is flooding your new queue

To play it safe, but I don't think they would appreciate that.**

Like I told Mod1

------

**from Mod2[M]**

First off, or that website.

This has to do with your behavior

The fact remains that over the past month an enormous amount of your participation here on Reddit has been towards promotion. Primiarily your game ""Dread""

And I should say at this point that I'm saying this not strictly as a moderator for /gaming. I'm actually here as an adjunct from /reportthespammers

So when I tell you that your behavior is lopsided in terms of promotion, but rather the site's rules.

That some moderators are more lenient while others more strict, your domains, and other matters hitherto unmentioned and unspecified.

And now you've had two warnings from moderators.

All that being said

Now, don't just submit a bunch of image memes to offset the balance (we actually do filter for that sort of behavior).

Otherwise

------

**from Mod1[M]**

In addition to what Mod2 said

------

**to Mod2**

Don't worry, or mean. I really do appreciate your clarifications on things.

Perhaps you can help define ""Promotion"" for me. As what you are describing above seems specifically targeted against content creators

Let's say a person makes and posts awesome info-graphics, etc... They are, by what you are defining, self-promoting and should therefore be banned?

What is the difference between ""Hey

------

**to Mod1**

Oh

------

**from Mod1[M]**

Only when content creators spam their content to reddit.

------

**to Mod1**

I mean this in the most respectful way possible

------

**from Mod2[M]**

While I can see where you're coming from to a certain degree

When any user (or group of users) puts their interests here over the health of the community... regardless of if they're trying to sell off-license viagra or trying to drum up a lot of attention for a charity... it's a problem.

Constantly promoting something makes reddit less enjoyable for other users. Thus it's the behavior and not the profit model that defines spam and motivates our actions.

------

**to Mod2**

I, rage comics submitted to /r/writing would be spam. But that doesn't mean that all rage comics are spam. They have their place, and are welcome and sought after in numerous subreddits.

I ask you then

------

**from Mod2[M]**

The truth is that any restriction we place on what users can and cannot post will be seen as unpopular. We've done our best

It is not in place to keep you from making users aware of your game

If these restrictions don't work for you

------

**to Mod2**

I understand, but hopefully you understand what I mean).

A lone indie dev like me does not have the time to go around scouring the net for other people's work to submit to fulfill your 1/10 quota. Nor do I have a reason to buy an ad for a free game I'm making in my spare time.

I will no longer post anything Dread related to /r/gaming. Perhaps

------

**from Mod3[M]**

And what we are trying to help you understand is that we aren't trying to cater to content creators

The 10% rule isn't designed to be a quota for people who want free advertising to meet

If you are only here for advertising purposes and do not intend on being an active and balanced reddit user then the best option for you is to purchase an ad.

That said

------

**to Mod3**

I definitely understand the need to weed out the people looking to use Reddit for free advertising. But I hope you understand that there is a difference between advertising something and submitting something you made for the communities enjoyment / benefit (i.e. every rage comic, etc...). I'm sure I don't want to see Reddit devolve into just another picture board anymore than you do.

And thank you Mod3 :)

We've had some savings

Our first game, with maybe a tiny buffer. Between [some production trouble](http://moacube.com/blog/cinders-postmortem-2-production-and-business/) and our own perfectionism, it took a year and a half.

We've had to stretch *really* thin to make it. I still remember having to decide between paying the rent and the electricity bill, it's just a funny story I tell to my friends when we go out for a beer. But back then -- holy shit was I stressed!

Still

It wasn't a huge hit or anything

It's been a year since the release now, if we're persistent, there are prospects of more substantial profits in the future.

So

I hope that my story will serve as an inspiration for some of you. Becoming a full-time indie is hard as hell

I would also like to voice my thanks. To the indie gaming community as a whole, useful info, and feedback.

(added: teamliquid has similar article
i already wrote steam-related problem into /r/gaming)

ok

- Game Rating Board - http://www.grb.or.kr / Warning: Korean Characters

Acts like ESRB in U.S. but created by government. don't have publisher corporation members.
BUREAUCRATIC. And of course they got fee - for long-time-consuming-blah-blah-process.

- Publishing games without rating is illegal in Korea

(added: Only made public to on-line
Found that ESRB rating is in most case
sorry for poor select of my words)

I heard that ESRB rating is OPTIONAL...

- Some indie game devs use RPG Maker. these devs are using forum to share their games
- I can safely say

here's recent facts

- September 1 (GMT +9) some of devs' forums got contact from GRB. like...

- ""Get your all games rated or cease posting games. Publishing unrated games are illegal. blah blah...""

- Coudn't afford the fee

oh then how much does that cost?

I looked up $$$ damn rating process fee table for 2010.
original table is using korean WON but I should write US $ with
and GRB have plan for raising these fees every year...
I'll use approx. 1175 won / 1$ today.

These indie-games got open-market
ah open-market game apps - GRB's making trouble here
not for /r/indiegaming.

here we go.

Basic fee per game:

- less than 10MB - 21000 won
- 10MB to 100MB - 50000 won
- 100MB to 300MB - 56000 won
- more than 300MB - 168000 wom

AND Coefficients... (This was somewhat difficult vocalbulary for me XD)

- Network related - x1.5
- Not network related - x1.0

AND Coefficients again per genres

- Role playing games - x3.0
- Betting-related, simulation, FPS - x2.0
- Puzzle
- Educational - x1.0

AND Coefficients for localizing

- Non-korean localized x1.1
- Korean localized x1.0

So... someone made 105MB of single-role-playing games in Korean
he/she has to pay 23.8 * 1.0 * 3.0 * 1.0 = approx 71.4$

and he will think like - ""I just wanted to make games and
uploaded to some forums
but why am I charged? why am I treated like criminal?""

and I never heard that Audiosurf or Worlds of Goo got their ESRB rating first. never.
(edited: my sentence above is WRONG. thx cableshaft!)

As pretty much a Mac noob, so...yeah.

I was hoping that Reddit could inject my brain with some info on how to best spend my efforts over the next few days to get the word out on the Mac release.  (I am thinking it will likely be Monday as long as compatibility testing goes well)

There are about 10 beta keys to spare for the press

SPAZ has done well on the PC

Lets say the top 5 upvoted suggestions get free SPAZ Steam keys as well.  Currently these are PC keys

Last time (over a year ago) that I asked for marketing advice for SPAZ
http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/f8w2i/getting_ready_to_sell_my_indie_game_after_15/

Thanks for any advice.  


p.s. Questions about SPAZ or indie dev in general are also welcome.

1340678063.0,vlwhn,Sold my first game this week and decided I should share my story so far.,,113,19,21,"Part 1 (The History):
Let me tell you a little bit about the history of my game: Flack. About three months ago, I had no intentions of selling it.

I soon began adding fun features such as interactive tiles, I was able to quickly whip up levels, and share them with the community. Then I got thinking: ""What if other people could share their own levels with each other?"". Days later, I started playing with the idea of selling Flack to the public, and I also began programming harder with this mindset.

At the start of summer, music, code, etc. I was honestly having a blast working on Flack. I had more thoughts like: If I plan to sell this game, I need to start finishing up real soon!

A month later, I had all sorts of emotions and concerns. ""Will people like this game?"", ""What if the game is total crap compared to 'x' game?"", ""What if I actually make good money?"".

Part 2 (The Lesson):
Then it hit me; my main goal for this game was not to make money, and excitement. It was time to sell Flack.

About a week ago, at this point, my original goal was not money, yet I was craving it like no ones business for no good reason. I kind of felt hurt that not that many people were interested in purchasing my game.

HOW FOOLISH OF ME! How could I let money get in the way of my goals?! I made a fun game

Part 3 (The Update):
I must say, THANK YOU FOR READING and I hope you are able to learn from my mistakes in the game of marketing.

If you would like to learn more about Flack or even try out the demo

Being an indie developer

We hope that you are willing to try our demo. It is a 100 meg download and gives about 90 minutes of gameplay. The Beta is on sale now and is funding further development.

Website: http://www.spacepiratesandzombies.com

There is a big shiny ""demo"" button on the home page. Please give it a try and tell your friends if you like the game.

There is a quirky 3 part review series below that gives a great description of the feel of playing SPAZ.

It's possible to build a graphically solid game even with low resolution textures, and many of my favorite games do this. One of the reasons I'm a big fan of Final Fantasy VII, which is, after a fashion, a controversial game (some love it, is precisely because of the painted (and pixelated) backgrounds. I'm thankful they didn't try to do with 3D what they simply couldn't at the time.

I know there are several reasons why an indie developer may choose pixelated. Budget, but still result in fun and playable games. Developers use pixelated art, and music to match, in order to complete the retro illusion. Sometimes there are technological reasons (low resolution art is more lightweight). Sometimes you're just making an artistic statement. And surely there are other reasons that do not occur to me right now.

But you know what I like even better than a solid 2D game with nice pixel art? A solid 2D game with gorgeous high definition art. A few years ago I got deep into the indie game community as a player, and am a little disappointed that, lately, a disproportionate amount of the games that are reaching me and that I hadn't played yet use pixel art.

Understand that I do not mean any offense towards all the redditors, and I'm looking forward to reading your views on the subject in this discussion. Pixel art will always have a place in my heart and in the indie gaming community. But my own view is that the retro style is becoming a little stale. I can't help but feel that a certain lack of confidence from the part of the development team is preventing them from taking the extra step and going with beautiful art and a more orchestral soundtrack. When a simpler art style is used so overwhelmingly more often, it tends to lose uniqueness. Your game no longer looks antique, it just looks old. Technology has evolved, and there is so much more we can do now. So why don't we?

**UPDATE:** My conclusions from what people are posting here:

1. Most of the developers among you have absolutely no confidence and are locked down to a narrow worldview.
2. Many of you didn't really read what was written in the main post, ignored the definitions proposed by the post you were replying to, or changed the subject altogether.
3. Many of you have no respect for the opinion of others

Preordering will get you into the beta

Besides the sponsorship ""get your name in the game"" option

There's the normal edition, and then there's the special edition, $20 now, $25 after.

What's the difference you ask? 

**Special Edition bonus content:** Additional Kingdom building

Looking at this one way

This game won the Excellence in Design award at IGF, or pirate it so they can play the whole game. Not to mention the problems it may cause with the devs having to manage two versions of the game, or people who would want to upgrade.

Hopefully this isn't violating any rules...I did my best to check first.

I'm making on an PC FPS-roguelike-ish-thingy called Tower of Guns (trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjsCcJr1WuI) . 

I've been working on it for some time and still have awhile to go (it's about 25% complete) 

The IndieCade guys have offered me a pass to the Expo (double wooo!) and a some L.A. friends have offered me their couches

Disclaimer: They'll show the game with or without me..so that's not in jeopardy...and I've been careful with budgeting so development isn't in jeopardy either...but I would REALLY like to actually BE at E3 to talk to press and publishers and fully take advantage of this great opportunity.

So

Also Pre-Ordering gets you access to the development builds

If you're interested in helping me get to E3 so I can be there with my game then please head on over to www.TowerofGuns.com.

And thanks so much! I'm super grateful to any and everyone who decides to help :-)
