From the article:

&gt;Johnson testified that he found two attempts to delete data on Manning’s laptop. Sometime in January 2010, on or around Jan. 31, someone attempted to erase the drive by doing what’s called a “zerofill” — a process of overwriting data with zeroes. Whoever initiated the process chose an option for overwriting the data 35 times — a high-security option that results in thorough deletion — but that operation was canceled. Later, the operation was initiated again, but the person chose the option to overwrite the information only once — a much less secure and less thorough option.

&gt;All the data that Johnson was able to retrieve from un-allocated space came after that overwrite

How likely is this?  I am new to this subreddit but I thought that a 1 pass zero wipe was good enough to prevent just about any document recovery.

tl;dr - Need suggestions

I'm building out a plan for an at-home digital forensics lab so I can tinker in my free time.  I have a general forensics degree but not much digital forensics experience so I thought this would be a good way to be able to walk the digital forensics walk when I have to (some day).  

I think I already have 3/4 of the equipment I need here at home

Tentative lab requirements:

* 1 x Windows primary computer for exploitation - Will have the primary software tools like EnCase, etc.
* 1 x Windows sandbox machine - Needs to be ""disposable"" in that I have to be prepared to rebuild for clean-slate purposes
* 1 x Unix/Linux machine - For NetSec study and analysis.  I've been trolling my local craigslist for cheap desktops.
* 1 x Mac machine - For Mac/Apple exposure.  Using this to type this post now.
* 1 x Mobile device - I have an old Droid X smart phone I'm thinking about using for this

These ideas are just a little more than throwing things against the wall and seeing what sticks.  I'm looking for advice and suggestions or even descriptions of what you may already have at home so I can compare myself.  Not looking for state-of-the-art LE lab level stuff


**16 August 2013 EDIT:**

I purchased a small Ubuntu machine with 8GB RAM and 500GB HDD

* 1 x Mac machine (8GB RAM
* 1 x Win 7 laptop (4GB RAM
* 1 x Linux machine (8GB RAM

One of these machines (probably the Mac) will get VMWare so I can set up several instances of various OSes and environments.  The Ubuntu box will be where the webserver and programming environment go and where I exercise my network security muscle.  Right now,,False,self,t5_2rubs,1376658840.0,,True

*trace the infection back to its source.

*help him harden his box against future infection

My main concern here is what if he has a virus piggybacking on top of a regular program such as explorer

As he apparently has some kind of trojan on his system, any IP address, emails out of the ordinary and/or things like FTP packets which are not things my friends knows how to use. If it is calling home somewhere, it has to show up in the packet dump somewhere which will give me a clue of just who the hell is doing this to my friend.

I then proceeded to see if Caine/Macquistion would see the KFHD if it was plugged in while they were running... They didn't.

So what I am asking is if anyone has any information of KFHD forensics or even KF forensics which could be applied to the KFHD to which I could obtain an E01/.dd image file. Has anyone forensically acquired a KFHD in the past using Encase/FTK?

Well....the title is really messed up but i really want to expand on it a bit. 
I used to be in the NetSec business a long time ago and we used to laugh about when there would be warrant less tapping across the continents through the use of a ""digital line"" and it wont care about international law or rights

One of the things we discussed was the use of a smear and propaganda campaign against an industry heavy-weight for a low-level implementation-device/software. This is to shift the majority of users towards a ""propped-up"" alternative which is not as good but gets the job done and has immeasurable advantages to people who use it, happening and hip.

The point of this all being the adoption of an already vulnerable system/hardware/software by the unsuspecting masses

Well....this is what i see in linux as time goes by, but would the normal, non-techy people be able to tell the difference? or care? not to mention, the revelation of a very hard-hitting yet basic security flaw in the (linux/grub????) architecture a couple of years ago in regards to physical login rights puts the theory of ""many eyeballs"" in the spotlight for questioning. 
That is just the start, memory corruption/injection, hardware level exploits affecting specific low-level software assemblies if the code itself is obfuscated for backdoor purposes? 

I apologize, with certain linux flavors being given many services and catering to the ""normal"" people, what does it say about their potential to be monitored? I am looking at you, Ubuntu -_- or their potential to be used like Microsoft's products have been in the security game? The commercial acceptance of Linux by companies such as Valve and others gave me hope at one time, but also scared me, as now there is nothing stopping the once-bastion and gem of the Opensource community to be used and abused as governments see fit.

I have a 3TB hard disk with GPT and EXT4 file system. I accidentally ""shift+del"" a directory which contained the only copy of some video files from a project that cost close to a grand. I'm not exactly a n00b to systems administration, creating images, working with images, etc. the whole lot. I am very familiar. The issue here the disk is just about full and it's backup is also equally full minus this one brand new directory that I freaking deleted (on accident, needless to say!!) so this isn't even really an option. This happend hours ago and thus far I haven't tried anything. I am afraid to make a move and while I could drop $150 on a new 3TB and do it the way I know by imaging the disk, bit by bit and working with copies of said image, etc.. I'd rather not go that route. I have many tools available to me such as extundeleted, it's like I'm frozen in shock and despair. Someone with experience in a similar circumstance please chime in with some comforting advice. What tools do you all suggest I try? I'm obviously afraid of altering the data since I only have ONE freaking copy to work with - the live copy on the disk itself! I'm ripping my hair out here.

From your experience what has been the most effective way to recover and report a users internet history. I have used EnCase

What would you do. (we are trying to give as much information as possible but don't want to go OTT)

1) give a summary of the users internet history over a specific period.

2) give a week by week in depth analysis over a specific time period.
