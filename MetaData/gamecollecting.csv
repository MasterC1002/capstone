http://imgur.com/a/AQp5R

I am currently selling my US SNES collection. It comprises all 721 retail SNES games released in the US, SFSW, and SNA3D.) It was built up from individual sales, so conditions range from near mint to fair. I took pains to spend more on better conditions for the more prized pieces of the collection.

Every single game has been professionally cleaned and tested. They all work perfectly.

I built this set to obtain scans and clean verified dumps for every game

This set represents three years of effort. From scouring every used game store in my home state, to donations of items that are impossible to find for sale anywhere, to hundreds upon hundreds of hours cleaning and polishing everything. I've never seen a set this complete before, and it's unlikely another one will ever surface.

I am asking $24,000 or more. For the collector who likes to play their games, this set represents the best price point. Not insanely expensive for VGA graded material, yet still clean enough for display.

I would prefer, which would hurt efforts to obtain more games to scan and dump.

If you are interested in making an offer, or e-mail me at setsunakun0 at hotmail.com

1368968535.0,1emmwg,Why I collect video games.,Cyclothymic-1,215,45,43,"I was once asked, it was a hot sticky day and my dad had way too many beers for how early it was still in the day. I did something to upset him, tender and tears streaming down. I didn’t run to my bed or to my room to feel safe. I didn’t hide or go to my mom. Where did I go? To the living room

When I look at my collection of games, it was fairly late in the game and I did not want to start all over. I ran through all the open areas so many times trying to figure out what I missed, and then I saw it. Just like in A Link to the Past the answer is there clear in the open just waiting for you to find it. Obviously if you want to knock a book down from a shelf you should try to make the book shelf wobble. Obviously if you see an open area that looks inviting you should try and blow up the glass tube which you have walked through countless times. Another a-ha moment that would draw me into video games even farther. I would use those skills not just in other games but in life as well. During the NES and SNES era games did not have voice overs, so playing text heavy games like Final Fantasy with out a doubt helped me become a better reader. 

I have so many memories about the SNES, and using the unlimited funds cheat in Sim City. I remember Saturday mornings especially well, I would go into town with my mom and sit through hours of grocery shopping just to be able to go to the video store with her. She would pick out a movie and I would get to pick out a video game to rent. This is how I got to play some of my all time favorite games. The Mega Man X trilogy, the Donkey Kong Country games and it absolutely cemented my love for RPGs. Final Fantasy 2 and 3 of course but my top 3 RPGs have been and always will be; Chrono Trigger, Super Mario RPG and Earthbound. I would rent those games so many times in a row that it probably would have been cheaper if my mom just bought them for me. My heart would be devastated if someone else had rented it. I had spent so many hours playing it, what if they saved over my game? As I got older and was able to actually buy my own copies of SMRPG and Earthbound, it felt like a reunion

I could go on and on about my memories with video games, Spyro and Metal Gear Solid were all playable. I played the MGS demo so much that I literally was able to do it with my eyes closed. Or how during one christmas I found my presents early and tore very small holes in the wrapping paper to discover GTA3. Video games are woven into me, and my life. After my boy was born I would play COD MW2 while he slept on me, I played with the sound on mute and had to whisper into the mic. He was my good luck charm, the only times that I was able to get the nuke was when he was sleeping on my chest. Or how about when my 6 month old baby girl was going through chemo? She did not sleep well certain nights so I would get up with her. I would hold her tight and rock her but the quickest way to get her to relax and fall back asleep was to play on my 3DS (3D off of course). She would sit on my lap and watch me play, I could feel her muscles relax and her head would nod off until she was finally back asleep. Even though it was the middle of the night I would keep playing and just enjoy feeling her breathing and knowing that she was comfortable and at ease.

Video games are a part of me, my kids are both holding a Gameboy advance in their hands, and maybe one day my son or daughter will look through my old games and say “Hey dad will you play this with me?”

I started looking through and he said he was selling his games because he wanted to save up enough money to get Sonic Generations for his PS3.  As I continued to look through the games

Chrono Trigger
Secret of Mana
Super Mario RPG
Castlevania:  Dracula X

My heart almost stopped upon seeing Dracula X, and asked the kid if he'd hold those four games for me, that I would be right back.

I ran back to my house and got my copy of Sonic and went back to the sale.  I showed my Sonic Generations to the kid and offered to trade him the Sonic Generations for the four SNES games.  He was EXTREMELY excited and took me off on my offer.  Just for good measure, and to give the kid the 20 dollars later.

So why am I making this post? Well

I was browsing the electronics section at goodwill, the boy looked strangely familiar to me; something about the way he looked and acted reminded me of myself.

 They walked along slowly and I noticed him eyeing the jungle green N64 I was thinking of buying for an addition to my N64 system collection. The boy was tugging at his father's hand as if to say ""look"".
I could hear him softly repeating, ""maybe another day, buddy."" The boy didn't contest any, but as he walked away he looked pretty disheartened. He looked back as they turned the corner, and I picked up the N64 without a second thought and brought it to the counter along with the few other games that were with it. 

I couldn't pass up this opportunity. The only reason I love gaming now is because a family friend gave us a SNES when I was 3

I looked around the store for the boy and his dad, ""Here. This is for him. He deserves it."" 

It feels so awesome knowing that the boy might grow up to love video games like I did

**In Conclusion/TL;DR**- If you get the chance


Edit: Thanks for the gold! I hope everyone can take something away from this story :) 

Edit 2: Since I sort of missed this part of the story
""Yeah, because the way he told the boy they couldn't buy it made me think that it wasn't because it was ""another toy he didn't need"" or something. They probably didn't have a ton of money to spend, because I got the impression that he really wanted to buy it for the boy, but maybe couldn't.
I didn't want him to try to pay me or anything though, and that was when I knew for sure that it was totally worth it.""",,False,self,t5_2s8fe,1370028137.0,,
