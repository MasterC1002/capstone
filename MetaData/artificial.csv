1338705168.0,uibdm,Smartcraft: Starcraft as an AI Research Topic,chras,37,7,9,"This post seeks to explain why I think that the video game Broodwar is an interesting and fulfilling topic for AI research.

Starcraft: Broodwar is a Real-Time Strategy video game that was released in 1998 by Blizzard. The gameplay centres on three interstellar races, the construction of bases and a military, and the conquest of the opposition. Matches take place on a variety of maps, include 2 to 8 players (human and computer-controlled), and typically last between 5 and 30 minutes. The game itself, and the sequel Starcraft 2, is played competitvely accross the globe

Problem Characteristics:

**Partially Observable** - The 'Fog of War' limits map visibility to the area surounding the player's units

**Multiagent, and games often involve a series of counter attacks and skirmishes until one side is worn down.

**Stochastic** - Whilst most actions are deterministic

**Sequential** - Decisions made early have lasting consequences. For instance

**Dynamic** - The environment changes over the course of the game - resources are mined out

**Continuous** - Players can issue commands continuously

**Complex Environment** - Each race can produce many different units

**Programmable** - A collection of very clever and dedicated people have written an API through which an agent can play the game, if not all, languages and architectures are viable.

**Replays** - Many thousands of replays are available for programmatic analysis. That is

**Low System Requirements** - The game is computationally cheap to run

**Accessible** - The game can be purchased electronically from Blizzard

These characteristics make the Broodwar agent problem very deep

TLDR; Broodwar is an AI problem that is complex but approachable

[Friendship Is Optimal](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/1/friendship-is-optimal) is a hard science fiction short story ([level 5](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dq0hn1LdXuglBUEshJZNWYZjV3wsAJBJsPfxWwEEexI/edit) on [Mohs Scale Of Science Fiction Hardness](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness)) that explores the implications of a general artificial intelligence tasked with maximizing an optimization function. The problem with Strong AIs that are told to maximize some function is best described via the [Paperclip Maximizer](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer), until it's exponential intellect eventually enables it to convert all matter in the solar system to paperclips. In Friendship is Optimal, this AI is tasked with maximally satisfying the values of all human beings, subject to certain constraints. In this way, the AI is, for all intents and purposes, perfectly benevolent and dedicated to making all of humanity lead happy

Unfortunately, turns it into a giant quantum computing device). In the process, it explores aspects of the human psyche, the effects on human society and its eventual disintegration, outlines how a virtual physics system might be able to simulate non-euclidean geometries, and describes magic as a simple programming language for reality itself.

Did I mention it's also a My Little Pony fanfic?

While a science fiction story of this quality would stand on its own without the hilarious association to the My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic franchise, as it does a vastly more effective job as hammering home just how *impossibly smart* a true runaway AI optimizer actually is. Our first instinct to the idea of the entirety of humanity being convinced to live out immortal lives in Equestria is that it is completely insane, and that there is simply no way a significant portion of people would actually agree to that, let alone *everyone*. In part, this is correct, but only because Celest-AI managed to convince just 99.99999% of the world's population. An AI that is more intelligent than the combined intellect of all of humanity would be *very* persuasive.

In the end, then Earth, then the solar system, then the galaxy, and finally the entire universe, and possibly any neighboring universes unfortunate enough to be nearby. And we would all live happily ever after. As ponies. In Equestria. And Princess Celest-AI would ensure you'd *love it*.

&gt;If programmed with the wrong motivations, it could be designed with motivations that initially appeared safe (and easy to program) to its designers, but that turn out to be best fulfilled (given sufficient power) by reallocating resources from sustaining human life to other projects. As Yudkowsky writes, “the AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else.”

&gt;Since weak AIs with many different motivations could better achieve their goal by faking benevolence until they are powerful, both economic and military, might lead AI designers to try to use other methods to control AIs with undesirable motivations. As those AIs became more sophisticated this could eventually lead to one risk too many.

&gt;Even a machine successfully designed with motivations of benevolence towards humanity could easily go awry when it discovers implications of its decision criteria unanticipated by its designers. For example

Is this a sound argument? Thoughts?

The idea started simple; have it reconize certain keywords ('appointment', 'check', 'update' for example) and then reconize a bunch of other tokens (date, name, etc) in the same sentences and see if you get enough information to save it to a database. If so, save it and if not, ask the user to supply more info.

Yeah... that's how the idea *started*

After I made the lexer to reconize a bunch of different tokens, I made a syntax free grammer parser that is (almost) capable of interpreting a programming language.

Obviously I went complety above and beyond my initial goal. I feel like I'm doing a 100 meter sprint in a Lamborghini and, this is a very nice Lamborghini and therefor, I don't want to hit the brakes just yet.

Now I want to make a language that is aimed at AI development. I think this could actualy work out quite well because even though AI is very broad... so are the options in a programming language.

The problem now is; my experience with AI is limited and I'm unsure what features the language will need in order for it to be usefull for AI-developers.

That's where I could use some help with

So far, if statements, function statements (without parameters yet), variable assignment and basic operators (which don't know about precedence) are supported, nothing more)

Here are a couple of random ideas I'm just gonna throw out;

Making every script a finite state machine could be nice for gaming AI's but would other types of AI benefit for that?

Switching boolean-logic with fuzzy-logic? Each fuzzy-element have an X amount of fixed numerical properties and a 'minimum' property. If the sum of the properties match the minimum it is considered 'true', though. Maybe just have it an extra data-type?

Some sort of short-term memory should be usefull... maybe ""key"" - ""value"" based? 'remember(""key""

Some sort of deviding conciousness and unconciousness

The core of the essay: 

&gt; ... my own interest in DeSTIN, that DeSTIN in its current form doesn’t touch.
&gt;
&gt;Itamar, implement it on a lot of machines, tweak the algorithms a little, connect it to a robot, and get advanced general intelligence. He has plans for an action hierarchy similar to the perception hierarchy, and then a reward hierarchy that gets a stimulus when the system has done something good or bad and passes this along to the action hierarchy, which then passes it along to the perception hierarchy. I agree that adding some stuff onto DeSTIN would be necessary to make it do anything like human-level intelligence. But I think you’d need to do a lot more than just add action and reinforcement hierarchies. I think the human brain is just a lot more complex than that, each one carrying out its own functions and all connecting together appropriately.
&gt;
&gt;To take just one example almost at random, because these models are all complex dynamical systems and we don’t know how to predict their behavior exactly. But yet, it really seems the brain doesn’t work this way — episodic memory has its own architecture, different in specifics from the architecture of visual or auditory perception. I suspect that if one wanted to build a closely brain-like AGI system, one would need to design fairly specialized circuits for episodic memory, plus dozens to hundreds of other specialized subsystems.

I avoided putting my personal thoughts on the matter here initially because I didn't want to colour the discussion. Here they are now in any case.

The cognitive model proposed in this book is the most compelling and illuminating theory about what processes occur in the mind that I have ever seen. When you compare it to almost all other AI research

The more immediate interest is to have a system that based on input data of the algorithms would know which is the best rule to use and how to interpret it's result (is higher or lower rule values better)

I am working with C#, I'm probably not the first one to want something of the sort.

Any direction you can give me would be greatly appreciated. I'm specifically looking for practical examples (and frameworks/libraries to use)

**/EDIT: I'll try to provide a better example here of how the whole thing is supposed to work:**

There is an algorithm that makes Start and Stop decisions. There are certain statistical/algorithmic/heuristic (Rules) measures that can tell the algorithm how confident it should be in its decision. Which rule is more effective depends on input data

The problem is that Start and Stop decisions can be separated by a rather significant time interval

2) Trained neural networks are generally overspecialized to the task they were trained on and need to be partially (if not entirely) retrained if they need to be usefully applied in other (even similar) domains

3) Neural networks are generally much more computationally expensive than a set of rules typical in symbolic AI systems

4) Neural networks generally lack short-term memory required for non-deterministic tasks

5) It is *very* difficult to understand what a neural network is actually doing (in a meaningful way) when it activates

To put it succinctly

    if (do this) then (this happens)

            else (if it was bad) then (remember so that you don't do it again)

The problem I was having involved the A.I.'s procedure for deducing what environmental data is critical to the cause of an event

    1
    0
    1
    0

With the original procedure, but as soon as it was given the conflicting data of 1,0 causing the event too, it would get confused and determine that they were irrelevant and therefore disregard them. Then, when the event occurred again, it would start that logic loop over again. Never learning from it.

For the last few months, I'd figure out one that looked great on paper, only to realize that I was making assumptions based on my own knowledge that it would not be able to replicate.

But today

I asked him whether he would call a fish ""intelligent"" (I'm aware that defining intelligence can get complicated). He refused to answer, running the same sort of low level ""machine code"", but using different kinds of higher level processes. IMO, the difference between the intelligence level of fish and that of humans resides in the type of high level interactions that go on in the brain.

I just finished the online Stanford AI class and I've been working on some of the [programming assignments](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs221/progAssignments/PA1/search.html) from the course syllabus.  Right now I'm stumped on the A* section, finding a path in which pacman has to touch all four corners of the grid.  Given a game state, the heuristic startings by calculating the Manhattan distance to the closest corner (called minDist). Then it calculates the distance from this corner to the other untouched corners (called extraDist).  It then returns (minDist + extraDist).

I'm pretty sure this is consistent, and pacman has to find the optimal path that goes through all of the food.  I tried reworking the heuristic so that it finds the distance to the closest food, and adds that to the sum of distances from that food to the other food.  This produced a solution rather quickly, but it was clearly not optimal, and pacman seemed to just go back and forth across the grid at random, eventually reaching all of the food.

The assignment starts out pretty easy,etc. to help guide pacman to a single piece of food in a maze.  I've been using a graph-based search, using a dictionary to remember which states have been visited.  Since there's only one piece of food, pacman should never need to visit a space twice, so the state space consists of positions.  I just used a dictionary called ""visited"" and did ""visited[state] = True"", and then made sure new expanded nodes weren't in the dictionary before adding them.

However, and a dictionary that keeps track of which corners have been visited (T/F for each corner).  My problem is that ""visited[state] = True"" no longer works, since it uses the objects location in memory for the dictionary.  This made it so that two identical states, which were created as two different instances of CornersState, will be different keys.  I made a kind of work around by writing a hash function for CornersState that depends only on the position/values in the corners dictionary.  By doing ""visited[hash(state)] = True"" I got the dictionary to work, but I'm not sure if this is a good way to do it.  Any suggestions?

HOW AN ALGORITHM AND A DISCUSSION GROUPS CAN BECOME ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:	
 	
If we combine (1) an algorithm similar to Google's page ranking algorithm with, and voted on we could create the world's first artificial intelligence. Let me first explain how it would work, and then I would like to explain how it actually qualifies as an artificial intelligence. This algorithm's goal would be to rate ideas similar to how Google rates web pages. If accomplished it could create the best website on the internet, because the website that used this algorithm would not just be sending users to other websites, the way Google does, it would actually become the destination, instead of just a way to get to the destination.

**HOW WOULD IT WORK:**
**1. REASONS TO AGREE AND DISAGREE:**

An algorithm can not read two ideas and figure out which idea is better. So the first thing we need to do is organize information, and reasons to agree in another column. The goal of the algorithm would be to promote the best ideas to the top of a page, or the front page of a website, and the best reasons to agree or disagree with an idea, to the top of their columns beneath the idea.

This simple step would do a lot to allow an algorithm to analyze the idea

**2. CLASSIFY &amp; ORGANIZE EACH POST**
BOOKS
The second step would be to allow users to further classify their posts beyond simple reasons to agree or reasons to disagree. People could suggest a book as a reason to disagree with an idea. Now start thinking ahead what an algorithm could do, or simply a logical argument. The third field would be a place where the user explains why he thinks the book supports the conclusion that he/she has come to. Of course, people would be allowed to vote weather or not the book actually does support the side that the original user said that it would.

This is where the algorithm could get very sophisticated. Would you want to give more credibility to those who said they had actually read the book? Would you want to give even more credibility to those who had bought the book, similar to how Amazon lets users write essays. Perhaps they could not let people copy and paste essays into the form. It would only allow people to type their essays directly, to prevent stealing of essays. Perhaps people could vote on weather the book-essays were good or not similar to how Amazon lets users rate reviews, as to weather the review was ""helpful"" or not. So, as an example, you could submit a best selling book as a reason to agree with an idea, and then right a thoroughly convincing explanation of why this book agrees with the idea, they must do this. We have plenty of books, we must know all of the reasons to agree or disagree with a particular course of action. In order to do this, so that we can make the right decisions. As you can see

**WEB PAGES**
In addition to books, the online community will be able to vote weather or not the web page actually supports the side that the person said it did. This would be so easy for Google to do. They already have billions of web pages classified, in descending order. If you download the Google toolbar, you can see a score given to each page, based on a scale from 1 to 10.

To help you understand what I envision

**MARKERS

In order to better classify each idea, where the topic would fit into the Dewey Decimal System, the Library of Congress, Yahoo, MSN, or Google Directories.

**COMING TOGETHER:**

If Google created an algorithm and a forum that would allow it to rate ideas and promote the best reasons to agree or disagree with a website, and websites that support their side. They are not coming to a ""common table"". We see no interaction. The book, Bowling Alone tells us that our society is becoming more and more isolated. Technology, which was supposed to bring us together, is largely to blame. Kids that used to play together in the street, now sit along playing video games. The internet was supposed to bring us together, but their are ""red state"" websites and ""blue state"" websites, and more justified in acting in extreme manners

**PROMOTING BETTER IDEAS BY PROMOTING BETTER BEHAVIOR**

Much of this idea comes from a dispute resolution. In order to resolve conflicts, before they are allowed to post a reason to AGREE with it, and visa versa.

A user could evaluate any of hundreds of possible characteristics of an idea. On a scale from one to 10 did the explanation make logical sense. Was it clearly written. Was it completely honest, as apposed to just positions. This will often allow win win solution where both sides are able to come up with solutions that accommodate all interest, instead of just focusing on one particular solution.

This would be easy to facilitate in a discussion forum. You would just create a specific place to submit ""probable INTEREST OF THOSE WHO AGREE"" and ""probable INTEREST OF THOSE WHO DISAGREE"". These can further be broken down to ""COMMON INTEREST"" and ""APPOSING INTEREST"".

Perhaps people who work as professional negotiators in the conflict resolution industry could be hired to suggest other ways of implementing best practices into an online forum.

**A TOP DESTINATION?**

I would visit a web page all the time

**MAKING MONEY:**
What if next to these posts... 1.	Ford is better than Chevy. 2.	Paper is better than plastic. 3.	The Chicago Bears are going to go all the way this year. 4.	Condi Rice is better than Hillary Clinton. 5.	Star Office is better than Microsoft Office. ... you had Google adds where you could buy a Ford, Microsoft or Star Office, or contribute to the Hilary Clinton or Condi Rice campaign fund?

**MORE ABOUT THE ALGORITHM:**
The goal of the algorithm is to put the best ideas to the top. I don't know which one of these would carry more weight. Here is a list of just a few of the characteristics of an idea

1.	Quantity of reasons that agree or disagree with the idea: The side with more reasons (to agree or disagree) would get more points than the other side. For example this idea has more reasons to agree than disagree. Just like when you fill out a list of reasons to or not to do certain activities, with an average score, and the smaller the standard deviating, the more confident you are of that score. I believe an early algorithm would be to multiple the confidence interval (CI) by the average score. This is called a weighted average.

2.	Number of people who agree or disagree with the idea: The side with more people who agree should get more points. People could vote for or against ideas. Again, you could be evaluating hundreds of characteristics of an idea on a scale from 1 to 10. In the future you may be able to chart an idea's performance on any of these characteristics over time. Perhaps, over time the average score for an idea's ""logical presentation"" will fluctuate with a downward trend.

3.	The website with better web links. Better is determined by Google rank. There would be a field where you could enter link that ""agree"" or ""disagree"" with the idea. The side with better web links would win. Example

4. Results of peer evaluations: Their would be forms that people would fill out that asked pointed questions about each idea. You could respond to each question on a scale from 1 to 10. These results would affect the total score for each idea.

5. Money. ""Follow the money."" People could donate money to this website if they believe in it. But a better way of doing it would be to let people donate money towards a specific idea. If you don't like the way this sounds you should read Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. I'll just briefly say that money is the only way of measuring someone's blood, it could be used on this website as tug of war analogue. Money could be donated to each side of an idea.

6. Experts. Each idea would get more points if it was submitted from the e-mail address of a professor with a degree in the subject mater that is being discussed. For instance if someone said that Abraham Lincoln was an idiot. And someone disagreed, the more points. Prestigious would be ranked by the US News report, or some other un-biased judge. I don't care about you people that say, ""The smartest people don't always make the best decisions."" We are talking about percentages. Of course the smartest people don't always make the best decisions, but they would tend to make better decisions that stupid or uneducated people.

7. Items that agree. People would be able to submit books that they think are important to read to make an educated decision about a certain topic. For instance ""The communist manifesto"" by Carl Marx and ""Atlas Shrugged"" by Ian Rand may be considered to be the most important books to read regarding weather or not we should raise taxes.

1352749190.0,132t0z,"I have an idea to develop a language similar to 
Prolog
your thoughts!",3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/132t0z/i_have_an_idea_to_develop_a_language_similar_to/,"The idea came from the following sequence of thinking:

The paint shop has three buckets of color: red
Person walks into the shop and buys the second one.
He goes home and paints his door.
What color is the person's door?

I tried writing this down in Prolog but found it unnecessarily complicated, but instead replies yes/no to the question if the door is blue or red. I would like a language that actually answers to the question with a result, and also with yes/no if necessary.

So first I'm going to write down the code written in my programming language

    color.    # enum
    color(red).  # enum value
    color(blue).
    color(yellow).
    
    paint.
    paint(first).
    paint(second).
    paint(third).
    
    # rule
    paint_color(X
    
    # declaration
    paint_color(paint(first)
    paint_color(paint(second)
    paint_color(paint(third)
    
    person.
    person(bob).
    person(carl).
    
    person_bought(X
    
    person_bought(person(bob)
    person_bought(person(carl)

This is the ""program""

    ?- person_bought(person(bob)
    &gt; yes

This is obviously similar to Prolog

Another

    ?- person_bought(person(bob)
    &gt; paint(first)

How does it work? The program first checks if there's a person_bought declaration

Now here comes the more complex example.

    ?- person_bought(person(bob)
    &gt; false

How it works:

1. person_bought statement found
2. person(bob) found
3. no statement with person_bought(person(bob)
4. let's find a matching rule
5. no rule found: person_bought(X
6. let's find a rule for person_bought(X
7. found rule: person_bought(X
8. color(X) :- paint(X) no such rule found
9. let's find a rule which uses color and paint together
10. found rule: paint_color(X
11. searching for statement paint_color(?
12. found statement: paint_color(paint(second)
13. from this I can assume that I can replace color(red) with paint(second)
14. searching for statement person_bought(person(bob)
15. not found
16. go back to step #11 and continue searching for paint_color(?
17. no such statements found
18. go back to step #9 and continue searching for a rule which uses color and paint together
19. no such rule found
20. result is false

And now let's see an example that does return true:

    ?- person_bought(person(bob)
    &gt; true

How it works:

1. person_bought statement found
2. person(bob) found
3. no statement with person_bought(person(bob)
4. let's find a matching rule
5. no rule found: person_bought(X
6. let's find a rule for person_bought(X
7. found rule: person_bought(X
8. color(X) :- paint(X) no such rule found
9. let's find a rule which uses color and paint together
10. found rule: paint_color(X
11. searching for statement paint_color(?
12. found statement: paint_color(paint(first)
13. from this I can assume that I can replace color(blue) with paint(first)
14. searching for statement person_bought(person(bob)
15. found one such statement
16. result is true

From here on

    paint_family(X
    family_subtype(X
    subtype_color(X

In this case, if such a connection exists based on the declarations. The idea is to mimic human thinking, where you can deduce the result from previous statements/declarations. In its final product, there would also be negations, and the system would be much more complex, so one query would be:

    ?- phone_number(friends(beginning_with_C(person(susan)))
    &gt; 523-436
    &gt; 431-126
    &gt; 358-234

The above query would be interpreted as ""get me the phone number of all friends whose name begins with C and who are friends with a person names Susan""

So what do you think? Can you see any faults in this? Can you think of an example when it wouldn't work? Does something like this already exists and there's no need to reinvent it?

I realize that the Mac voice command can already do things like this (""what time is it?"" &amp; ""tell me a joke."") but what I'm wondering is if there was a way to link this with other applications. Something that could read article titles in an RSS feed. Or giving weather information based on the computers current location. Spoken notifications ""So and so has posted to your Facebook wall.""

&gt;This ancestral structure was likely a group of densely packed cells, and integrate previous experiences into some sort of learning.

Compare to my suggestion here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/8uwcq/are_worms_intelligent/

&gt; This is me trying to start thinking about my own understanding of intelligence.
My idea is that maybe the basic capabilities of intelligent systems are less numerous and complex than most people think. Maybe its starts with a basic ability that even a worm or an insect has

&gt; A worm has to do some things that are actually pretty smart when you compare them with the abilities of the average computer:

&gt; * integrate fairly arbitrary patterns of sensory information from its environment with a time dimension

&gt; * use this information to determine the actions that will most likely lead to a desired set of sensory patterns in the future

&gt; In other words, **move in the direction of a scent to obtain food.**

&gt; My theory is that perhaps the worm must be intelligent in order to do this and that the difference between worm intelligence and human intelligence might just be a matter of something like being able to handle more complex sensory relationships over greater time spans and also having more built-in patterns for predicting the correct actions and integrating senses.

solving the &lt;b&gt;perception&lt;/b&gt; problem or solving
&lt;b&gt;perceptual AI&lt;/b&gt;.

The representation can be learned by feeding
enough data to a unsupervised learning algorithm.
There are many unsupervised learning algorithms
Recently popular ones are 
stacked autoencoders (and their generalization - 
encoder graphs). It might be that only a single
layer is required - in that case something similar to a 
 large Singular Value
Decomposition is all that is required. 

&lt;p&gt;The data for this would be videos (images+audio)
audio
to be labelled. It is simply sufficient to scrape
data from the web
and feed it in.

&lt;p&gt;
To make a speaking computer
perceptron on the outputs. A perceptron is a 
simple machine learning algorithm that
is trained to answer yes/no questions. A typical adult
has a vocabulary of between 10
A perceptron would be trained for each of those
words. The parameters for the perceptron would
number in the millions to billions. Modern software
such as vowpal wabbit can handle this.

&lt;h2&gt;The Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; train large feature representation 
(unsupervised learning). Requires no labelled data.

&lt;li&gt; train perceptrons to handle any of a number
of different situations (supervised learning). Requires
labelled data (input-output pairs)
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Using the above approach
&lt;b&gt;unfriendly AI is not possible&lt;/b&gt; 
unless you train it
on the supervised data set to explicitly be ""evil""
or to feed it a dataset of a person's life so that
it carries out what a person would do.

&lt;p&gt;
The large feature representation only needs to
be &lt;b&gt;trained once&lt;/b&gt;. Afterwards
can be built on this base. This could be 
&lt;b&gt;as powerful
as any human ability&lt;/b&gt;.

For example to train a ""computer programmer""
give it a dataset that consists of objectives and
the stream of activity of a human programmer.
For example

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;objective : ""write a program that prints hello world in python""
&lt;li&gt;out : the keyboard character stream of programmer
who completed this task.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You would get some more data of this type. You
would then chop the keyboard stream into pieces
for example
would then have rows of data. Each row would
have one output column
have a large set of input columns
&lt;i&gt;preceding&lt;/i&gt;
characters that were written before that particular
instance of the character. 

&lt;h2&gt;Example : A simple 
&lt;i&gt;the cat sat on the mat&lt;/i&gt; speaking
AI&lt;/h2&gt;

Splitting the sentence
&lt;i&gt;""the cat sat on the mat&lt;/i&gt; at (sa)t would give
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;output : t
&lt;li&gt;input : t,&amp;nbsp;,c,a,t,&amp;nbsp;,s
&lt;/ul&gt;
The input would be put through the ""featurizer""
and then the output of that
millions/billions of columns would be fed into a
perceptron for the character &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; which answers
yes/no to whether a &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; should be typed.

&lt;h2&gt;In Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
It it possible to create AI for any 
&lt;b&gt;precise definition&lt;/b&gt; of the term by training
a large enough feature representation &lt;b&gt;once&lt;/b&gt;
and then giving it datasets that correspond to the
&lt;b&gt;ability&lt;/b&gt; you would like it to achieve.

It is possible to do this &lt;b&gt;now&lt;/b&gt; with current
supercomputers
