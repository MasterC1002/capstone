""Because I am a product of my culture and natural selection. There were selection pressures applied to the development of Homo Sapiens that favoured group cohesion. I have inherited instincts towards empathy and cooperation. These instincts, I have grown up in a culture that has imprinted these values into me. Because children are genetically programmed to develop this way, I have absorbed and accepted these values. That is the reason I don't murder people, even though I do not believe in hell.""

Now, as the theist may argue. Had the selection pressures been different, you and I would have been given a very different set of moral instincts, and we would have been holding those just as high. 

So does this lead the non-theist straight into nihlism? I mean

I would be very interested in hearing some of the non-theistic moral foundations people might have. I'm familiar with Kant, and even modern moral theorists, but I don't like any one of them. Besides, I don't think most people who claim to have good moral foundations have ever heard of those things.

**Note:** I will not presume to speak for all my fellow Taoists

Quite frankly

Taoism is a very old tradition, and gods run rampant.  It is shamanistic and ancestral, basically your classic Chineses religion.  But there is also the ""philosophical"" side, which is heavily intelectual, and has very little in the way of supernatural ideas or 'faith' in any way.  This latter form is what most of /r/taoism fall into.

Most of Taoism is about understanding the Tao (or ""Dao"", its best to understand the Tao, because then you can better act harmoniously.

To a philosophical Taoist, it's best to walk the correct direction.  This is obvious, and harmonious.  Sometimes though, the ""unobvious"" is harmonious.  For instance, if a path in the opposite direction connects to a better path to get down the hill.  This concept is embodied in something we call ""Wu Wei"" or ""Wei Wu Wei"", ""Action without action.""  The point of which is that the obvious act is often strangely unharmonious.  And often it is timing and accuracy that define success, rather than bull-headed strength.

And then of course there is the Yin-Yang, and how we can often only know things in relation to their opposites.  You can only know light with dark, hot with cold, active with passive, etc.

Now all of this comes to a head at the very start of the root text of Taoism the ""Tao Te Ching"".  First two lines:

&gt; The tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao

&gt; The name that can be named is not the eternal Name

Which, but to understand the infinite workings of everything, you must find it with an internal dialog.  To go on about things is not only pointless, it's necessarily counter-productive.

Now I see a lot of people in religion that are really trying to find *themselves* in their search for ""God"" or a higher power.  This is evidenced by people ascribe their own values on to their higher powers.  Only after you find yourself can you find your gods.  Only after you ponder the true nature of the world around you can you find yourself.  And that might seem metaphysical

I don't expect any one will truly understand my words.  You will deny things, and be completely correct, but it would get us no where.  There will be a disconnect.

But at least you can understand our perspective a bit better after this

1340061885.0,v8ysz,Subreddit Housekeeping: Some Potentially Helpful Discussions,TheBaconMenace,27,7,10,"Greetings

I have noticed some trends lately in comments on this subreddit. I realize this place is not the most active these days, or individuals willing to share their knowledge on a particular topic (a modified AMA style). These discussions would not welcome vitriolic or parodic comments. The discussions would begin assuming that the figure or topic to be discussed is not nonsense or irrelevant but worth the time to wrestle through in order to be better equipped to dialogue about the philosophy concerning religion. The mods do not bear the sword for nothing, and in this case I would be making sure to weed out comments that do not contribute to constructive and cordial dialogue and debate.

The most obvious trend that appears to have cropped up is a growing number of contributors who are analytically-minded but unfamiliar with the vocabulary and major figures of continental philosophy, postmodern theology, phenomenology, etc.), major figures in continental and analytic philosophy/theology (Hegel, Kierkegaard, Caputo, Wolterstorff, and possibly certain narrations of recent historical movements in continental philosophy (I'm very partial to genealogies of thought

They could be histories of metaphysics that introduce the history of metaphysical ideas in that way or an introduction to metaphysics that takes a less historical tact in making that connection. Or books where an author exposits their own particular metaphysical outlook that has a ""religious"" or profound significance.

By ""religious"" I mean some kind of world view that is ""divine""

I mean metaphysics in a particular but broad sense of the term where an ultimate meaning to the universe is elaborated alongside an attempt to ground that meaning in a philosophical apprehension of what the universe is.

I am not Christian or an adherent of any organized religion. While I do have my own metaphysical outlook, its just that I am excluding organized religions because I find a Christian/Muslim/Buddhist outlook unsatisfying when I am looking for a philosophy/metaphysics that isn't grounded in a particular ""revelation"" but rather grounded in philosophical reason. (However, I think Schleiermacher claims to provide a purely philosophical justification for a variant of the Christian religion, and in as much as that is the case then it interests me)

By ""philosophical reason"" I do not mean only purely discursive reasoning but also reasoning that takes into account the subjective and aesthetic aspects of life.

I am interested in both continental and analytic ideas but I would find a metaphysical outlook more generally satisfying if it unified the aesthetic aspects of life with a metaphysical outlook- (or at least showed how the aesthetic is difficult or impossible to unify with a metaphysical outlook)

I also know that there is a post-modern outlook within the philosophy of religion that is anti-metaphysical. While I find that fascinating

Right now I have the ""God of Metaphysics"" which is by T.L.S Sprigge coming through inter-library loan

(I recognize that sometimes unorganized religious ideas can take place within the symbolism and framework of an organized religion. For example T.L.S Sprigge dedicated his last book to a Unitarian Church in Edinburgh- I am not opposed to or uninterested in organized religion in that sense but I'm more interested in the underlying idea than in an organized context of worship)

Furthermore, agnostics and deists can be every bit as, if not more so, vehemently opposed to organized religion or ""religious thought"" as atheists; recall that agnostic Bill Maher made ""Religulous.""

Furthermore, not all. Those beliefs will most likely express themselves in how those people interact with other people individually as well as political and economic entities.

A proposed god knows everything

Is is possible that what we call everything and what a higher being might call everything is very different? We say we ""know"" a piece of metal, he doesn't see me. He doesn't know everything. But we say, we know this piece of metal. We know its shape, temperature, hardness, color, etc. We don't care about the energy levels of individual particles as long as we know their average. (That gives us the temperature.) We know the whole. That's what matters at our level of existence. And we have control over the whole. 

A similar analogy can be made with points on a plane. We ""know"" the plane

Could a god's knowing everything and existence be similar? Things will happen at the ""particle level"" (the lower level of existence where we live) that he doesn't know and can't control. And they are possibly insignificant. He knows the whole

So in that case the wrongs we see (along with everything else we do) would be insignificant

I'm interested in talking about the relationship between the various distinctly religious asceticism(s) - everything from vegetarianism to celibacy – and secular 'lifestyle choices'. 

One common trope I've observed among people who identify as anti-religious is mockery of the renunciations certain religious people make. 'It's stupid not to eat pork just because your god told you not to' would be a standard example. Looking at this, rational (I don't know yet whether or not they are, which is why I'm starting this thread). 

Another starting point would be the (apparently but not necessarily common) opinion in the UK that immigrants and British Asian citizens ought to drink beer, is it not quite a good idea for people to be teetotal? Does that change if the source of this is not consciously rational, but because it is a religious commandment? Of course at this point things get complicated.

Anyway:

As the trained philosopher of religion will not fail to note, it is a conflict not between two competing objects with competing referents who otherwise are (have their Being) in the same way, but one between different ways in which these objects may be. That even objects which reference the ‘correct’ God may be idols, and the fluidity with which objects may traverse the divide between idol and icon both suggest this distinction. Rather, what is at stake is two distinct “modes of apprehension [or reception] of the divine in visibility.” [2]

For Marion, given for the gaze’s use. It is not properly a forgery because the fabrication only enters the status of idol in the later, determinative, moment when it presents as “that which will fill a gaze.” [3] “The gaze makes the idol, not the idol the gaze—which means that the idol with its visibility fills the intention of the gaze, which wants nothing other than to see.” [4] The gaze stops upon some thing (the idol), and the idol re-presents that stopping point—the gaze’s own aim. Thus, but it shows this in a way that masks over—renders invisable—its own operation. [5]

The icon, but “provokes” it towards a vision unaccountable within its own aim. [6] In the icon, Paul’s formula rendering Jesus the “icon of the invisible God” becomes paradigmatic; the icon does not present the visible as a means of discerning between visible and invisible, offering an image for the grasp of the gaze. [7] Instead, the icon presents the invisible precisely as invisible; as that which confronts the gaze without becoming an object for the gaze’s determination. The privileged reference here is a face; because the gaze and aim that determine the icon as icon are not those that belong to the one who apprehends the icon, but to the icon itself as presentation of the invisible, the one who apprehends finds in the icon not a thing but an aim alien to herself, while the idol’s reflexive origin admits a fixed point of return, abyssal “infinite excessivess.” [8]

What is important here for the philosopher of religion is the idol/icon analytic when applied to the conceptual names of God. How is one to address our praise to true God rather than idol?

This means that theories involving irreducibly complex terms will make implausible predictions

Thus religions involving intelligent gods are not likely to be true unless the complexity of that god's behavior is reducible.

One thing to be careful about is that this all only makes sense if your theories make predictions. Reducing a god's behavior to terms like ""anger"" is meaningless,False,,t5_2sfeh,True,,,t3_i4yur

I've been reading up on the Ontological argument via Graham Oppy's ""Ontological Arguments and Belief in God"". I've also been reading the book ""Realism and Religion"" edited by Andrew Moore and Michael Scott which had an essay that briefly talked about how God is supposed to be mysterious. I got to thinking, i.e. I'm not claiming truth and originality.)

The first is the weak argument:

* 1. If God exists
* 2. If God exists
* 3. Any being which cannot be understood in their entirety cannot be known to be the greatest being that can be conceived.
* 4. Therefore

The second is the strong argument:

* 1. If God exists
* 2. If God exists
* 3'. Any being which cannot be understood in their entirety is not the greatest being that can be conceived.
* 4'. Therefore

I'm looking for holes in the argument

I can't see a theist rejecting 1, why he chooses certain things (e.g. why he chose to answer prayer x in one way and not another, or why he chose to answer prayer x instead of prayer y), or the fact that we don't completely know God's nature.

I think most critiques will be aimed at 3 and 3'

The only critique I got was that 3 has no merit because ""greatness"" is subjective, they are based on silly word games"" and ""...theists don't generally rely on reason anyway, for their existence claims, they rely on faith"" which don't help me at all. Subjectivity is the only thing that I could see wrong with the argument.

You see man has for a long time been dependant on the existence or virtual existence of a ""god/s"". Correct me if I am wrong but have not all tribes had a god of some sort? Well my philosophical observation is that the there are real gods out there, destroyers of worlds but of course the reverse is also true they claim life and create worlds.

Now what if we were to continue as if this was true, maybe we are angels fallen from grace (sillmarillion anyone?).

Maybe this is the reason that we always look up at the sky in awe, is divine while our minds are mortal? Maybe our bodys affects our minds because it wants to become divine once more, and this is the source of the human curiosity which drives us?

Well, where you get a short “biographical” sketch of a god or goddess – what they “look like”, what their likes/dislikes are, a myth or two, and what their “function” is (i.e. you call on god x for healing, god y for courage, etc). It seems very reductive, everything has to get neatly filed away in little boxes.

&gt;For me, so it’s about how I relate to everything – a much bigger proposition. And that, i think, comes down to making a commitment to live in a particular way, to recognise Lalita’s potential presence in every moment, every encounter.

""
**New Year Greetings: Secularism is also faith-based**

.....


**We should be happy for secularization**

When we go into 2013, must learn to distinguish between 'secularity' and 'secularism'.
Secularity we should be thankful for. In Charles Taylor's understanding, that the possibility of both religious belief and denial of God is open. Within and between these there is the possibility, of course, a wealth of alternative approaches. The point is that a society characterized by secularism principle opens public space for the diversity of positions in relation to the religious.
Secularism, its results and limitless possibilities in an enlightened and a-religious future. For secularists, the distinction between church and state is only the first step to displace religion to the private sphere, and then get rid of it completely. The paradox of this position is that it is faith based. This means that it requires the clearance, as the secularity creates. Secularism suppresses this dimension in its essence. It claims to operate with objective and scientific truth.
For all of us who are genuinely interested in matters of religion, we now live in, may be known as the 'secularity’s time'. While secularism is exclusive and judgmental, secularity gives room for diversity and creativity.""

You know that the world exists

The world is made up of different things. Things have attributes. A thing can have a name, sub-things, a location (or distribution of likely locations), etc.

You can see, etc. the world, and you have learned to identify patterns in it over the course of your life.

Some of the patterns you have learned to identify make up a language. A language is a customary association of phrases with meanings. Some phrases are legal and others are illegal in your language. Some sequences of sound are words

Human language is unique among animal communication because it is recursive. Recursive means that valid phrases can contain valid phrases. ""The squirrel on the branch of the tree with the yellow leaves is eating.""

Logic is a method of transferring falsehood from some statements to others. Based on which statements are true

Human languages have syntax and semantics. Semantics is meaning

Logic is mostly about syntax. The only meaning that it contains is ""false"". Sometimes, etc. As you can see, we can compose ""false"" with itself and with combinations by using ""that"". The syntax of logic combines the idea ""false"" in the same way that the syntax of language combines words. Every inclusion is also an exclusion. Identifying when something has a certain attribute is the same ability as identifying when it doesn't have a closely related other attribute. ""False"" is a property of some logically defined statements, and some statements are statements about statements (logical statements can contain other logical statements).

It is untrue that it is snowing here now. If it were snowing, and the air here feels room temp, and it would feel different if it were cold enough for snow. Closed rooms block snow, and I'm inside a closed room. It is definitely not snowing here now.

Descartes said ""I think, nearly all of the identifications you've made over the course of your life might be false to a large or small degree. But there is exactly one thing that withstands questioning completely: ""Am I questioning?"". You can't reliably doubt whether you're doubting without being sure that you're doubting. Doubting/questioning/asking/wondering/thinking are all the same process; the answer takes the form of classification, which you sometimes do inaccurately by mistake; classification is identifying attributes of things.

Each human has a brain. Humans also have kidneys and hair. Birds and earthworms also have brains. But only the brains of humans (unique among creation, and a human has a brain. A human brain complicatedly gives rise to a mind (neurons encode categories, and they fire in patterns, which induce other patterns, is our current understanding). It's straightforward how a mind gives rise to a brain: it thinks that brains exist. The person associated with a mind knows/believes/suspects that s/he as well as other humans and animals have brains.

If a statement contradicts another statement, then there is a flaw somewhere in your system of belief. Based on the leap of faith (thankfully a safe one) that a unifying explanation exists that accounts for everything you think is true, you can search for and usually find (i.e., think of) a way of expanding or adjusting your system of explanations that results in no contradictions.

Logical truth/falsehood is objective. Everyone who accepts the premises (axioms) of a logical system gets the same answers if they calculate correctly. Procedures have been developed that have correct sequences of steps. If you know logic

There is a different world in the head of each person. The world as you believe it exists is based on how you have learned to explain your sensory input over the course of your life. You're the only person who has ever had your particular trail of sensory input, but you're using your grammatical rules to combine the words that you think the speaker intended. All you ever have access to is your own system of knowledge.

It's really important that you can make statements about statements. Then you can know how wrong a statement is; you can also know how sure your estimation is of how wrong a statement is. People who have gotten very good at identifying statements that are very probably not wrong work in the fields of science and math.

A logical system contains no contradictions; with the right axioms, be inconsistent.

It seems that the minimal number of axioms is one. That means that the minimal axiom is that there is exactly one axiom. The one axiom is the number 1. Combining it with itself and combinations of itself yields all of logic.

God is responsible for the fact that the universe exists. The universe, total consistency. Total consistency cannot be derived from inconsistency of inconsistency. God is beyond our system of knowledge. God is Truth.

&gt;What is the smallest possibly thing I can possibly call my ""self""? If I cut my arm off

As a materialist, there are some questions about how much I can cut up my brain, but at least I know that my brain is the seat of ""my self.""

However

* The first idea was from my friend: your self is your spirit-soul. It is your personality.

*  The pastor on Google said that your soul was a part of the constellation of the mind, ""Your soul is your personality; it is your memory banks."" 

Now, but surely Christians, especially Catholic and Orthodox and the liturgical churches, have a more complex view of the ""self"" that are not easily dismiss-able as these two ideas.

1333634226.0,rulrw,A note on downvoting.,TheBaconMenace,11,5,0,"Thanks for the increased participation at this subreddit. I've appreciated the discussions that have been going on.

I have noticed a recent increase in downvotes that seem to be quite arbitrary. I figured perhaps it would be helpful to remind everyone of the purpose of downvoting.

Downvoting is used to weed out links that are not explicitly related to the themes and issues of philosophy of religion. Thankfully, of course, to disagree with the opinions or subjects expressed in a particular link or discussion, but downvoting them will only make them less visible to readers who may legitimately want to interact with them. Checking the ""new"" page revealed several links that had not made it to the front page because of arbitrary downvoting.

Thanks!

I was at church a few days ago when the service was about to end. I noticed that a speaker told everyone to greet one another and for everyone to say hello to new people I was a new person

I told my friend about it and he remarks that I'm being judgmental and that only God can judge others. The problem here that I'm seeing is that he is referring to judgment defined as in

What I continued to say to him was that because the congregation did not really approach me

I could not put it into words, the people had failed to greet the new people and instead more or less bound to their cliques. I said this was a problem that needed to be fixed. I told him that I'm more of a guy that, if I saw a guy running outside with his shoe laces loose, I'd point it out that he might want to fix it because he could trip. In that sense, I don't think that is being judgmental in the same way people judge others as good or bad.

This is important to me because we hear that phrase all the time: ""Only God can judge me"", avoid him."" and a judging of this sort: ""If a city has a police department that fails to do its job, then that's a problem."" One is simply an opinion and the other is an observational assessment.

The other issue that I have with the topic of judgment is that I feel that people can use it as a defensive statement to ultimately neglect their responsibilities. Maybe someone might say, you are being lazy."" Then Joe (who does go to church) might say ""Only God can judge me."", when he spent his latest paychecks buying a PS3 or whatever and playing that 10 hours everyday. If a person is being clearly lazy, then saying they are so would be pointing it out as an observation, not a statement with ill-intent. But Joe in this case feels slightly hurt by this statement and thinks of it as an attack. So if this sort of ""judging"" were not allowed, then it seems Joe can do what he pleases and use his same phrase.

Well thanks for reading this and comments are appreciated. I'll talk about this more with my friend next Sunday.",,t5_2sfeh,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofReligion/comments/obhh7/only_god_can_judge_me/

* **Studying/Interested in:** I'm currently researching and writing on Kierkegaard and political dimensions of his thought. I'm interested in radical theology (theist, et. all) and alternative forms of higher education (some friends and I intend to start an institution at some point).

* **Helpful Links:** I find summaries or shorter articles to be the most helpful. Databases collecting papers or resources are also excellent.

Okay, but only for a short while. Boredom and restlessness soon arises when you have everything you could ever want for all of eternity. The way to solve this? Mortality. There's no point in reproducing if you are immortal. With no need to worry about death, there's no need for reproducing, as you'll forever be alive and surviving. Why does God let such bad things happen to us? Because of free will. Free will means that God does not have control over us. He is not our omnipotent puppetmaster. He is our omnipotent creator, who lets his creations create a life of their own. Interfering and moderating that would contradict free will. And with free will comes misery, sadness, loss, and pain. But with free will comes peace

I believe that God had already planned for Eve (or Adam) to eat the fruit, and other crimes exist because humans have created them. God did not first kill. Man did. He knew that we would feel pain, but because he loves us, he knew that it was necessary in order to bring true happiness. I'm sure that it pains him to see the world in such a miserable state, but he knows that we'll pull through by ourselves. He loves us, and therefore, gives us free will and independence.

tl;dr: God intentionally created us with free will

In the end my interests go towards archeology of religion and ritual/ anthropology of religion on the one hand - and on the other hand toward iconography and the study of religious images. Non-western theology is definitely interesting, some islam, roman/greek, other heathen religions. Maybe I am going to focus on cults and sects from the last centuries of the roman empire - or how heathen elements survived up until today and were mixed with christianity. 

I know these are all BIG subjects

Recently I did some reading on the Soul as described in the Bible. It's a surprisingly complex subject. One thing that I found really interested was that the ""soul"" is not presented quite like many people think of it nowadays. 

The word ""nephesh"" doesn't refer to a disembodied ghost which controls a meat vehicle. The wiki article defines the word like this "" According to this verse God did not make a body and put a soul into it like a letter into an envelope of dust; rather he formed man's body from the dust, he made the body of dust live, i.e. the dust did not embody a soul, but it became a soul—a whole creature""

The idea is is that the soul is not merely some disembodied mind that controls the body but is the entire being itself. 

Going off of this

The idea of a disembodied self really comes from Plato's influence rather than early Church theology. Thinking on these various theological ideas I thought of something. 

I'm not sure this is a new way of approaching the mind-body problem but let me know or give me some feedback on what you think. I think the Christian Mortalist view on the soul would solve the Mind-Body problem but additionally I think it might fit with current neuroscience. 

I'm relating this to the idea of Emergence. The idea is that the sum can be greater than its parts alone. Consciousness, but are actually the immaterial quality which comes from their complex interaction. 

This theory of the mind is usually tossed up by hardline logical positivist who want to take the wind out of theistic sails. But it seems to me, that it is probably the most accurate description of the soul as the Bible describes it in Genesis.

(1) An event E is an atrocity if and only if one is morally obligated to prevent E from obtaining

This is of course complete absurdity. Lets consider it a little further

I think it would make sense because theoretically an infinite can exist only if the time that it came into existence was not infinite in the past. Like you can't have an infinite number of past experiences because you would have to go through all of them to get to where you are now which is logically impossible (since infinity can never be reached or crossed), if you were ever to go back into a nonexistent state, then you would not now know that you are now conscious.

Then there is [*Religion and Theology: A Sermon for our Times* by John Tulloch](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26035/26035-h/26035-h.htm), Tulloch is discussing a St. Paul's quote, ""I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ."" Tulloch equates this ""subtilty"" with theology.

&gt;What the special corruptions from Christian simplicity were with which the minds of St Paul's Corinthian converts were assailed, illustrated by the tie which binds the bride, as a chaste virgin, to the bridegroom. It was not an ingenuity, nor a subtilty, nor a ceremony. It involved no speculation or argument. Its essence was personal and emotional, and not intellectual. The true analogy of religion, is that of simple affection and trust. Subtilty may

He argues towards the end that it is the job of theologians to adapt to this new age, and they also *want* guidance about how to be closer to god, but maybe that guidance these days has let them down, has led them away from Christ (or whatever god they worship) and real religiosity.

The ""default"" understanding of causality these days is *natural causality*

A major paradigm shift occurred in Western thought with David Hume's redefining of causality to essentially describe it as a correlation between events in a series of successive sense impressions:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality#After_the_Middle_Ages

To this day skepticism of causality rationally triumphs over any argument

But there's another (very ancient) way to define causality, in terms of ""I""). This encompasses even the solipsists and other worldviews which deny the outside world or the natural world.

Here
 
I am a human being. I think, conscious, etc.
 
I exist (passive). Existence is defined in terms of ""I"". I will (active). Will is also defined in terms of ""I"". When I *will* things
 
This is irrespective of the form or content of these thoughts which are taken from a steady stream of input from my senses as sense impressions. I will not address at this moment where these sense impressions come from or what they might describe or the reality of the things they describe. All I know is that *""I""* exist.

This is the only way I can think of to rationally define causality without having it torn up by any competent philosophical skeptic (especially a solipsist).

The first axiom to acknowledge in any form of rational ordering of thoughts is, therefore I am. Existence, in whatever form it may be (not necessarily the existence of our physical bodies, but the ""I"" that thinks, *is*). Existence is the passive manifestation of ""I"" and will is the active manifestation of it (or if we wish to be traditional we can define both as properties of ""I""). There can be philosophical problems with ""properties"" though and it's just as easy to say they are passive and active manifestations of ""I"" because this is intuitively perceived and acknowledged.

Therefore by virtue of experience (of living and thinking)

**What use is such a definition?**

It can be used wherever natural/physical causality are used but to be so used would necessitate some metaphysical conclusions which otherwise can be ignored in a purely materialistic/naturalistic view of the world. So while it can be of much use and it is more robust

Besides

On the other hand, you know, solipsism). At the very least it is more rationally stable foundation for addressing the natural world (as opposed to mere faith in habit as per Hume's definition). Actually, check that, it is *the most* rationally stable foundation because it uses the fewest number of universally accepted axioms to define causality.

**What metaphysical views does it necessitate?**

Metaphysics comes into play when one applies this idea of causality to our sensory input.

We can describe the external world as a product of our own mind or of another mind, physical, natural world... or even to believe that it is a computer simulation (the matrix).

Really, they're engaging in purposeful ignorance which is irrational to begin with and irrationality is worse than incorrect rationality, the latter may at least be corrected).

**What about the free will vs. determinism debate?**

That doesn't really apply here. Whether one believes in free will or not

The person who believes in some amount of free will, so if our wills are not free they must of necessity be slaved to another actually free will since cause necessitates will somewhere up the chain of responsibility.

One thing they cannot stand is that I don't have a religion. They are Christians and they say that they would be fine with any established religion (i.e. no Pastafarian or Invisible Pink Unicorn).

I am interested in religion as a part of human culture. It's fascinating that people have formed their own religions and have many ideas about how the world was created. Also, etc). 

Is there a religion that focuses more on the nature of religion and how one should live one's life rather than how to become a good Christian/muslim/etc? It's a pretty unrealistic request since a lot of religion revolves around believing in a certain god and doing as the religious texts dictates. 

I took a seminar on various religions and found taoism and even buddhism to be quite interesting since it's more about how one should conduct oneself without overly religious bearings. It almost seemed more like a philosophy than a religion.

After hearing a lot of people talk about this whole higher power/super consciousness soup thing, talking about a super agent. Most people don’t even have a fucking clue what consciousness is.

Here a list of various definitions of the singularity:

http://www.singularitysymposium.com/definition-of-singularity.html 

But it’s basically a collection of concepts related to uninterrupted exponential technological growth. One of the predecessor phrases was “intelligence explosion.” 

First I’m saying that I think exponential technological growth is not only possible but real. The next step I’m taking is putting that possibility in context. If the singularity CAN happen

So if our universe or multiverse is a simulation running on a higher order operating system it’s theoretically possible that that higher order reality has become saturated with consciousness

That said

 
Tj x: But yeah people are talking about a super-agent. Which I tend to agree is superficially ridiculous

Justin x: You do have material and processing limits. This is my response to the singularity proposition. There is a greater probability that you would run out of material resources or reach a processing ceiling than there is for infinite exponential growth in information technology.

Justin x: I also find it to be a major leap of faith to assume that a virtual world would be conscious of itself. Why am I assuming this? Why wouldn’t the executive software be a second system unnoticed by the virtual universe? It is super fun that this is where “god” comes back in the picture.

I think you’re wrong about the material limits and the information processing limits. I’d have to review Kurzweil’s book before I could get back to you with a robust response.

 

I never said anything about the virtual world being conscious of itself yet. I definitely think that our universe mustn’t be aware of itself as a whole. 

“Any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic.” 

If what is outside of our virtual reality is unsurpassed consciousness then the simulation hypothesis becomes a form of panintheism.Yesterday at 6:17pm · Like

1344405897.0,xva23,A Question on the Persistence of Consciousness Assuming the Existence of God ,,2,2,3,"Note: I have never before posted to a philosophy or theology subreddit

I was born and raised in an very devoted Catholic family. As I grew up and went through high school and college, one of which has been bothering me a great deal lately. I will attempt to lay out the basis for the question as I conceive it.

Assume first that God exists as described by a general Christian consensus. My question does not hinder so much on the technicality of a description of God's characteristics or intentions

[1] God Exists

Next, as written in the Wikipedia description of Heaven by Christianity (found here -&gt;  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven#Christianity): 

""The term Heaven is applied by the Bible to the realm in which God currently resides. Eternal life, unspoilt and perfect creation, which can be termed Heaven since God will choose to dwell there permanently with his people, as seen in Revelation 21:3. That there will no longer be any separation between God and man. The believers themselves will exist in incorruptible, resurrected and new bodies; there will be no sickness, no death and no tears. Some teach that death itself is not a natural part of life, but was allowed to happen after Adam and Eve disobeyed God (see Original Sin) so that mankind would not live forever in a state of sin and thus a state of separation from God.[26][27][28]""

I understand this to imply that Heaven is necessarily a place void of sin. Thus:

[2] Heaven is a place void of sin.

Next, without “evil,” “good” necessarily is not realized. There cannot exist something a polar opposite if the idea or thing at the other extreme does not exist.

[3] Awareness of opposite modes gives each mode a meaning.

Next

[4] Humans have free will 

Next

[5] Free will depends on a clear distinction between opposite modes

Next

[6] Humans are conscious

Lastly, on the choices we make throughout our lives. Or, perhaps a better way of saying this would be: who I am, is dependent on the choices I have made in the past. Who we are, is a result of how we have acted in the past (at least partially). Also, some choices, because we are operating under the assumption that God exists, premise [1] requires that sin is defined by God, are dependent on the outcome of a potentially right or wrong choice.

[7] Some choices humans make have a right and wrong outcome

[8] Human consciousness and awareness of oneself is dependent upon the choices we make.

[9] Some element of human consciousness and awareness of oneself is dependent upon the difference between right and wrong.

Now

If who I am is characterized by the choices I have made, if heaven is void of sin, and sin is, at least in part, responsible for the distinction between right and wrong, or good and evil, then how then can I truly exist as I am in awareness of myself today? If I have no knowledge of evil, which is, but am completely prevented from choosing to act evil, AND I have the ability to make a choice between evil and good
Thus

I got sidetracked by the classic ""Can God create a stone he cannot lift?"" loaded question fallacy. My first reaction was to show why it's a fallacy before pointing out that it is one. Some attempts quoted below.

I felt that I couldn't back away

So

Exhibit 1:

&gt;I anticipated as much. I don't expect you to accept that that argument is bogus

&gt;- How much force do you have to exert to lift a rock of weight A (Newton)? F &gt; A

&gt;- How much force do you have to exert to lift a rock of infinite weight

&gt;When you can get back to me how to make sense of a quantity larger than infinity

&gt;The contradiction here does not lay with God's all-powerfulness

Exhibit 2:

&gt; By defining the object as ""so heavy it cannot be lifted""

Exhibit 3:

&gt; How do you defend the self-contradictory definition of a ""stone heavier than can be lifted""? And to put things into perspective

&gt; 1. If God is omnipotent

&gt; 2. He cannot make object A

&gt; 3. Therefore he is not omnipotent

&gt; Classic modus tollens.

&gt; Counterargument: Object A doesn't even make sense, not in the way that it is factually false. The argument is thus scrapped.

Exhibit 4: 

&gt; Because you're already assuming the answer in the question. I'll point it out: The rock gets heavier approaching the point of god being unable to lift it until it becomes so heavy that he can't.

&gt; This sentence assumes a few things

&gt; 1. It assumes that such a thing has the property of existence.

&gt; 2. It assumes that there is a point that God cannot lift.

&gt; ""Have you stopped being a douche?"" cannot be answered in such a way that contradicts the assumption that the person has in fact been a douche. The normal response is to correct the questioner: ""I have not been a douche."" and not give an answer. The same applies here.

&gt; We're trying to define God using reason, implying--linguistically--an ability or lack thereof. Rationally, there is no ability concerning objects that don't even make sense from the start.

Here is my question:
Later in the book, but my question concerns that preserver aspect.

He mentions the principle of inertia, that an object in existence stays in existence. As such, the cosmos in existence stays in existence. Adler says that IF the cosmos was created by God, this inertia of being is sufficient to explain the continuing existence of the cosmos, and nullifying the notion of God being a preserver.
