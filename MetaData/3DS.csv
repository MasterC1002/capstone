* #1. File a police report AND request a copy - You MUST file a police report or else they won't be able to give you your games back. Do it right away because it will take 3-5 business days to process. I had to file online which took a few days and then I paid 6$ for a copy to be sent to me.

* #2. Call Nintendo customer service - Find the phone # on the website.  Have the serial # of the stolen 3DS (and the replacing 3DS if you have it) and your club nintendo ID ready.

* #3. Send a copy of the police report via fax or E-mail - Make sure to write your name

 I faxed the report and 2 full days later they reimbursed me $195 onto my club nintendo account to buy back my games and gave me download codes for all the games I downloaded via club Nintendo rewards. Nintendo was very easy to work with through the whole process

EDIT:

I have contacted both Nintendo and the airline of the plane the DS was found on. Nintendo couldn't help me as the DS was never registered

I DID get Nintendo to help me remove the parental controls so I could dig around and see what I could find. Unfortunately it wasn't terribly helpful. There are no saved accounts aside from the basic name/birthday/state listed on the Streetpass.

Here's what I know:

The child who owned this 3DS is elementary school aged and male. He is latino

I have pictures of him, and a pair of older folks who are probably his grandparents. I popped the SD card out and dug around on it. I found some audio recordings, only two of which have voices, and both seem to be his mother talking to someone else. I was hoping she would talk to the boy and maybe I could get a name, but no luck. I have searched the backgrounds of all the pictures for clues, but couldn't find anything useful.

Plug in some good earphones for this one, but I think this one is going to go straight into the 3DS Hall of Fame with Super Mario 3D Land and Animal Crossing New Leaf. 

It's a great time to be a 3DS owner

Anyway, I'm so excited about this game! Feel free to ask any questions if you want and I'll try my best. I'm playing the Japanese version, but I doubt they can really be any different with release dates only a couple of days apart.

1370741870.0,1fyi7u,A new (temporary) submission policy pertaining to Animal Crossing submissions on /r/3DS,Kuiper,234,54,53,"As most of you are probably aware, in order to keep /r/3DS as a subreddit that is interesting and relevant to a broader audience of 3DS owners, and we expect that the volume of Animal Crossing submissions will only increase once the game has been released. Consequently

&gt;Please avoid submitting the following:

&gt;* Submissions which are not created to provide/acquire information or generate meaningful discussion (e.g. ""HYPE"" threads)
&gt;* Submissions which presume either ownership of or familiarity with an Animal Crossing game
&gt;* Submissions which pertain directly to specific portions of AC:NL's content (user-generated or otherwise)

Everything else is fair game.

To provide a better picture of what kind of posts the new policy is intended to achieve

* ""Who else is totally psyched up to pick up their copy of AC:NL?""
* ""AC:NL owners
* ""I created a hilarious costume for my Animal Crossing character (links to screenshots inside)""
* ""What's your favorite furniture set in AC:NL?""
* ""I discovered a fast way to harvest fruit in AC:NL (video)""

Some alternative venues for these types of posts include /r/3dsFCswap (for swapping friend codes), /r/casualnintendo exists for things like funny screenshots.

Some examples of submissions that *are* allowed on /r/3DS:

* ""SuperAwesomeGameStore is offering 10% off purchases of AC:NL!""
* ""GameReviewerDude's review of AC:NL is up""
* ""Interview: Animal Crossing producer Katsuya Eguchi discusses how he achieved his creative vision with Animal Crossing: New Leaf""
* ""Animal Crossing: New Leaf sells over 600

In general, ""Would this content be interesting or useful to someone who do not own and has never played Animal Crossing?""  If the answer is ""no,"" then perhaps your submission is better suited to a subreddit like /r/animalcrossing.

Do note that this is a *temporary* submission guideline

Having your submission removed as part of this new submission policy is not considered a punitive measure.  We will remove posts which we believe break these submission guidelines (and encourage users to report submissions which they believe violate these submission guidelines),,False,self,t5_2ruhy,False,,True

""Now the most well-known adventure game in the world comes alive in the new 3D version of this Classic Story!""

This statement obviously implies that the game is in 3D. There is absolutely no 3D to be found in this game.

However

Example #2 from e-shop video: http://i.imgur.com/iScpm.jpg

In-game screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/idIOX.jpg

As you can see from the e-shop video; they are clearly misleading customers into thinking the game is played on the bottom screen. This would seem logical and in fact was a selling point for me. They made the size of the top screen displaying ""MYST"" the same aspect ratio as the 3DS top screen, you have to control the pointer with the circle-pad which makes it basically unplayable- it's basically taking the raw input from the joystick and plopping it on the screen- if you release the stick- the cursor goes to the middle of the screen.

1367741295.0,1dq2ab,Anyone else think Super Mario 3D Land is both amazing and disappointing?,thebesticando,181,44,97,"(SPOILERS AHEAD) I say this as a big Nintendo fan

 - The overworld was very basic
 - The special stages were not very special. Some were pretty challenging, then evil mario, then evil mario and a timer. 
 - The method to 100% was pretty tedious. Having collected all the star coins in every level
 - The P-wing. I never saw a P-wing until a mystery box had one in it, just unfortunately disappointing. 
 - Not enough levels

I REALLY hope we see a Super Mario 3D Land 2, more levels, a proper hidden/secret/final world, A PROPER P-WING. 

I'm a huge Mario fan and this game was great, with good reasons. The elements that made those games amazing didn't exist in this game at all. I didn't feel a sense of adventure at all, just ""next stage, next stage, next stage, etc"". Also, none of the ""New Super Mario Bros"" games do it for me. The visuals and music all seem so bland to me

1369311825.0,1ewdkj,5/20/2013 - 5/23/2013 /r/3DS Survey Results (≈2800 responses),eojoko,158,38,67,"That was fun! Here is a link to [the original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/1ep1gh/here_is_a_new_r3ds_survey_it_is_more/).

Here's a [**large pic that summarizes the responses**](http://i.imgur.com/gm3bhEr.png). (I used [tinypng.org](http://tinypng.org/) to compress the .PNG so imgur wouldn't turn it into an ugly .JPG)

I also have a spreadsheet with every individual response timestamped and recorded for detailed analysis
) and [mediafire](http://www.mediafire.com/download/a7w0se1nxfpslhg/5-20-2013_r3DS_Survey_Responses.xlsx). Let me know if you want the spreadsheet and aren't happy with the file hosts I've chosen.

Here are some thoughts on the questions:

**What is your biological sex?**

Yeah

Anyway

**How many years have you been alive?**

I separated ages into what I considered major ""eras in life"", having 18 and 21 separate from 19-20 means the data would of course show way more 19-20 year olds. Still, it's not too difficult to add the results up and see that 18-21 year olds make up about 35% of the responses. About 10% of the responses were from people above 30. I'm not counting the few who answered &gt;70 — I suspect those responses are from pranksters. I also noticed that if you were exactly 70 years old, the way I had my answers set up meant you couldn't answer the question. Sorry if this excluded any 70 year olds.

**What region is your 3DS?**

I should have split this up into two questions. ""What region is your 3DS?"" and ""What region are you?"" 

3 of the China responses match up with people who also responded they were &gt;70 years old so. . . I'm not thinking we had any Chinese responders.

**Which 3DS do you own?**

Taking into account those who sold/traded their 3DS and now have a 3DS XL

**When did you buy your 3DS?**

I was surprised at how evenly these responses were spread. However

**Which of these Nintendo gaming systems have you owned?**

Shout out to /u/supermanhat who owns a Virtual Boy! Sorry I forgot about it. The graph shows this question's responses well. Thanks to /u/Supermegapig for correcting the percentages for these responses:

|||
:---|:---
| NES   | 43%
| SNES   | 49%
| N64   | 67%
| Gamecube   | 71%
| Wii   | 72%
| Wii U   | 23%
| Game Boy   | 47%
| Game Boy Color   | 70%
| Game Boy Advance   | 67%
| Game Boy Advance SP   | 60%
| Game Boy Micro   | 9%
| Nintendo DS   | 58%
| Nintendo DS Lite   | 59%
| Nintendo DSi   | 25%
| Nintendo DSi XL   | 9%
| None   | 1%

**What upcoming 3DS release are you most looking forward to?**

I think the most popular write-in here was Super Smash Bros. Yeah

**What is your current favorite 3DS game?**

I would recommend any future survey/poll avoid write-in responses as much as possible.  They're hard to see. It would've been better to try to include as many games as possible as choices. Of the 400ish write-ins to this question, Star Fox 64 3DS, some Theatrhythm, 1 Pokemon Dream Radar, 3 Ghost Recons, some Tales of the Abyss, a good amount of Kingdom Hearts, some SMT:DSO and Soul Hackers, and ***1 Cooking Mama*** (how cute are you?).

**What is your favorite Nintendo franchise?**

I forgot F-Zero

**What are you doing with your life?**

No

**How Many StreetPass tags have you collected?**

The amount of responders with over 3000 StreetPasses suspiciously matches up with the amount of responders over 70 years old. . . plus one. So I think one responder is for real, and 543 have 0 StreetPasses, so that's only around 150 people who are carrying their 3DSs and not getting Passed.

**Do you know someone

I'm jelly! I don't know anyone who does

**How important is it to you that your digital purchases are tied to an account and not just your system?**

No surprise here

**Do you usually take your 3DS with you on the go?**

Happy to see most of us do. To those of you who don't: get hip to it!

**What do you most want?**

Most of us just want to be happy. I was happy to see that ""I want to be famous"" and ""I want more power"" were the least popular. Not that there's anything wrong with those responses — we need famous and powerful people! But most of us seem to have our egos in check.

**Would you rather live. . .**

It looks like most of /r/3DS wants to live in the city. You can have a city. Why don't you take it!? You're gonna make it after all! I guess it makes sense: more people means more people to StreetPass. Besides

**What's your favorite thing?**

This is the EarthBound question.

**Have you looked at the [/r/3DS FAQ on the sidebar of /r/3DS](http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/wiki/faq)?**

Imagine an /r/3DS with no redundant threads. 49% of us already have. I thought it was telling how very evenly split the response to this question was.",self,t5_2ruhy,1369344363.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/1ewdkj/5202013_5232013_r3ds_survey_results_2800_responses/

Just wanted to say that we have not ever removed or censored a post directly due to it being about flashcarts or circumvention of the 3ds firmware. It's quite related to the sub-reddit and unless links to roms start getting tossed about

For the record, but stop reporting peoples links and every comment about carts, it's just a waste of time we generally let votes do the talking there, and lots of respected users here have carts. 

You may now go back to playing zelda and donkey kong jr. :P


EDIT: Some of you seem unable to read. Allow me to re-iterate. I am not announcing that we are free to share links and spread the word about piracy. I am stating that flashcarts and homebrew are perfectly legit topics. Most of you seem to get the picture here

Like it says: 

Feel free to ask me my opinion on any of the games. Hopefully this can help you decide your next purchase :)

Edit: I am a pretty serious gamer

5 is not an average game (it was given to Sonic Colors due to it being a very bland-feeling Sonic game, or just had flaws that I wasn't fond of. A perfect 10 would be a game that holds my interest, is incredibly fun, and maybe a minor issue or two that are not really detrimental. I would have given Monster Hunter a 10, if the 3DS version had online.

I do not use Circle Pad Pro on anything.

All my ratings are on the game itself, how much enjoyment I get out of it, overall satisfaction, and a little bit on the graphics. Sorry to use broad terms.

So, I keep passing this one girl and have been just about every day. It's actually pretty cool knowing you're going by this same person, have been exchanging messages with them, and yet have no idea who they are. After passing this person like three times she sends me a personal greeting.
 

""*Dorm buddies? :)*""

 
Huh
So the next day I pass by again (I think our rooms might be within range of each other anyway)
 

""*Maybe. 1516?*"" (name of the dorm hall).

 
So I wait another day
 

""*Yepp! 1516! :)*""
 

Cool
 
Hmm
 
""*Yepp! 1516! :)*""

As many know, 600 coins gets you Platinum status).

So if you've got some 3DS games you haven't registered yet

EDIT 2: For North Americans

* Create an account at [Club Nintendo](https://club.nintendo.com/)

* When you buy a console or game

* Once you've registered the console/game PIN code

* A week after registering the game

* Make sure to link your Club Nintendo account to your console so that eShop purchases can earn you coins and points as well. This can be done from the Settings menu in the eShop.

* Coins earned allow you to buy reward items from the Club Nintendo catalog. **Coins are good for 2 years before they expire. They will rollover into the next Club Nintendo year unless they are old.**

* Points go toward your elite status; Between July 1st and June 30th, your points reset.

* Gold and Platinum status means that Nintendo will offer you your choice of reward for free; you won't have to spend your coins on it. Platinum members will have a greater choice of better items than Gold.

1361154484.0,18q5l9,Why Animal Crossing might not be for you.,,170,62,82,"**This is an unreasonably long wall of text so for the short version check the TL;DR at the bottom.**

The intention of this post is to give people an honest alternative opinion on Animal Crossing. This subreddit has a very positive view of Animal Crossing and that is what led me to pick the game up. It was not for me. Don't get me wrong, **please feel free to correct me on any objective inaccuracies so that the comments can be a good resource for potential buyers** and not an unhelpful shouting contest. **I'm basing my opinions on limited play of Animal Crossing: Wild World for the DS.** This took place a few months ago (long after there would be much activity online, I didn't even try out the online aspects).

**Anyway, or to come back to my 3DS after that period of time. It didn't feel like it was worth the effort. There are also NPCs or events that are only available on certain days (one of them was an art dealer IIRC) and for the same reason I just didn't feel any motivation to set aside time on the specific days to talk to these people or compete in these events. Another specific event thing that irritated me was that if you didn't check up on people for a few days or week they might leave. There was a duck that lived nearby that got ill so I bought him medicine on multiple occasions and he thanked me even though he was still sick. After I took a week off he left the town. It felt like the things I did do didn't matter, and the things I didn't do mattered more.

My initial interest was based around the NPCs but **the collectibles also failed to impress me.** You collect fish, shells, and art. These can be sold or put on display in the museum. Collecting (especially fish and bugs) was interesting at first but quickly became boring when I realized that the money felt pointless (explained later), the museum seemed pointless, and I would have to play the game at certain times or days to collect everything. It seemed to be based on chance and time commitment. If I could suggest one thing in this area (however implausible) it would be a lot more interesting if collectibles required some creative or resourceful thinking. Maybe to find a special fish you could use certain bait or use a technique that maybe an NPC could clue you in on. Perhaps this was already implemented and I just didn't have the patience to look into it. I just wish that collecting was more about thinking or exploring than collecting everything that randomly spawns at the given time that you walk out your front door.

**The last nail in the coffin was customizing the house.** This was the thing that I was least interested in from the get go but at this point I was desperate to squeeze some enjoyment out of this game. I don't understand why a lot of Japanese games have customizable houses. I just must be one of the few people who don't find that interesting. You start out with a small house. If you pay a certain amount of money to Tom Nook you can increase the size of your house. At this point, excited to plan how I would use the extra space. After all of that tedious work, the house had increased from 4x4 to 6x6. I was pissed. This seemed completely disproportionate to the grinding it required. I guess I expected another room. This change allowed for one or two extra pieces of furniture.

There doesn't seem to be a good length of time to play. I get bored if I play for a long period of time. However, and grind for money it feels like I will be punished. It seems like a chore.


I was done with the game. I picked up Harvest Moon: A New Beginning. I haven't played it much but what little I have played has been much more like what I had originally wanted from Animal Crossing.  Time does not pass in between sessions so there is no false sense of urgency to pick up and play. I think the more structured task of tending to crops and later selling them appeals to me a lot more than collecting random objects.

**TL;DR**

**1) I found the NPC interaction shallow and uninteresting**

**2) The persistent world (time continues between play sessions) makes the world less laid back than it seems. Spend too much time away and weeds will grow and citizens that you like may leave.**

**3) The collectible are based on random chance and time commitment. It feels like a grind**

**4) You have to raise a large amount of money to increase the size of your house just a little.**

**5) Long play sessions get boring. The game seems to encourage short (around 15 min) play sessions daily to avoid consequences. It feels more like a chore than entertainment.**

**6) Animal Crossing is not a bad game but it is not for everyone. If you were drawn to Animal Crossing but this review has raised some red flags,,False,self,t5_2ruhy,1361157385.0,,True

They told me that they will price match fry's offer as long as it matches the product 100%.  Yes

I found this on slickdeals, 1 k-mart, and finally the target that price matched it for him.  I went to best buy and was declined then walked next door to target and was unboxing my new 3DS 20 minutes later.  They had never even heard of Fry's (none around me), yet they matched it without much problem at all.  Your mileage may vary.  Perhaps I was lucky, but if you live near a target and are hurting for a 3DS it may be worth your time to give it a shot.

First of all, I just bought a used 3DS from cowboom for the exact same price last week.  This may be good for those looking for a deal or those that would like a backup.

It was $108 after tax for me (In Louisiana).

As a member of the press I've got a review copy; for the sake of the embargo this has to be considered a ""preview"". To keep it short: Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is really damned fun. As an early adopter of the GCN I enjoyed Luigi's Mansion but always felt it was missing... something. I could never really put my finger on it. Well, filling Luigi out as a character, and offering enough of a challenge to keep me coming back. 

The game has a mission-based structure that allows you to replay levels to try to beat your previous score, and searching for Boo ghosts that can be a right pain to catch. 

There are plenty of hidden passageways, and exploring rooms again after you've found power-ups can give you access to new rooms, cash and other stuff. 

I haven't even tried out multiplayer yet

Anyway

If you've got questions about the game I can try to answer them

Cheers

&gt;Please avoid submitting:

&gt;* Memes / Rage Comics.
&gt;* Pictures not directly related to the 3DS system or games for the 3DS
&gt;* Nintendo stuff not related to the 3DS (try /r/nintendo instead)

Offending posts will be removed as they come up.  If you'd like to lend us a hand, and we thought it was time to formally put it into practice.

If you have complaints or criticisms of this policy, we'll open the discussion up to the community and see whether we want to adopt this as permanent policy or go back to the old ways.

-----

Now that that's out of the way, although we're currently baffled about why the number of 3DS owners should suddenly spike on this particular date.

The surge in activity (all starting in the mysterious and cryptic date of December 25) has put us well over the 4k subscriber mark, located over at /r/3dsFCswap.  (We apologize to those users who have had problems with our 3DS friend code bot--rest assured that we are working toward a solution.)  There are also a number of 3DS-related subreddits dedicated to specific games, like /r/Swapnote, /r/Pushmo, and /r/MK7RC.  This list is expanding all the time, so for the latest, be sure to keep your eye on the sidebar located to your right.

This year has not been without its ups and downs, when we have titles like Animal Crossing, Kingdom Hearts, Kid Icarus, Metal Gear Solid, Monster Hunter, Paper Mario, there is no doubt an amazing year ahead,self,

I finally decided to buy a 3DS now that the Midnight Purple colour has been released. Once Future Shop had opened today, sorry about that, they're giving away some crap game with the system. Do you want it?"" I asked if I could have a game that wasn't crap instead, but he said he couldn't do that. Spirit Camera was listed at $20 in Future Shop. He did a bunch of customer service stuff and handed me a copy of the game.
             
Once I was back in my car, so I drive over and take Spirit Camera into the building. Before I returned it, I walked down to the game section to see what Walmart is selling it for. Turns out to be $40 plus tax.
           
Back at customer service, but he didn't really give a shit.

* I am only buying games on Steam. Do not post links to an Amazon wishlist or ask for eShop codes.
* While I don't want to set a dollar limit on the prize
* An additional 'entry' can be earned by writing an *insightful* (read: not half-assed) review of a 3DS game. Once written
* RULE ADDITION (EDIT): Your Steam account must appear to be 'valid' in order to be eligible to win. This is usually enforced via account creation date

My mayor character equipped his spade without going to a menu. I pressed down and he put it away. Continually hitting right or left rotated through his equipment. Finally a way to avoid getting stung by bees that the DS version would have greatly benefited from. This is the best feature. 

Another great feature is the ability to fill in holes or rub out tiles with the Y-button. 
Edit: you don't need anything equipped you just kick sand.

You can take screen-caps by pressing L and R-shoulder buttons at the same time. 

Mushroom collecting for more bells. 

The 3D is crisp and really draws me into the game. 

The village map seems smaller than the DS version

Floating presents now appear on the play screen (which is the upper 3D screen) so they're easier to find and shoot.

The map is always on and you can tap a location and it stays highlighted as a type of guidance.

-That brings me to the mission structure itself. It's very convenient, but I understand that they're meant to be difficult to track down.

-Luigi: What he lacks in dialogue, humming, etc. all adds tremendously to the overall experience. 

My most memorable moment (so far) is in the Secret Mine when Luigi finds the first set of teleporters. His reaction is priceless. Trembling, smiles, and then starts waving at himself. ""Hello? Hello! Hello. Hello! It's me!""

This game is about going slow, such as hidden treasure, and details about the game itself, like the ones that I've mentioned. Dark Moon is skyrocketing to the top of my activity log, and this is why. I can crank up the 3D, plug in my headphones, and just get lost in the game. It's one of the few games where I can honestly say that I feel like a kid again when I'm playing it. I could go on and on about the puzzles and gameplay

EDIT: One final thing that I think really adds to the sense of mystery and exploration are the security camera images, being able to peek into rooms and see how the ghosts act when Luigi isn't around (and their reactions when they do notice him!) adds a level of depth that most games can't even hope to achieve.",,False,self,t5_2ruhy,1364951049.0,,

Thought I'd share some of my impressions of the three games for y'all...

**Kid Icarus: Uprising**

Three levels were on show, you know that's high praise. The controls were fluid and the stylus-driven aiming smooth. You get a choice of seven weapons before each level, and the gameplay seemed very intuitive Basically, you hold the left trigger for quick fire, but stopping fire for a sec while holding down the reticule on an enemy for a sec before firing lets out a heavy shot, usually obliterating the creepy looking sonsofbitches. Dodging fire is a blast, too. The Kid is very nimble and you usually get a small window to flick the slide pad to avoid enemy fire. 

What I wasn't expecting ere the on foot sections, so needless to say I was impressed. 

There was also an AR card demo set up on one of the Icarus units, they got really excited! Hope I didn't get their hopes up over nothing haha. 

**Mario Kart 7** 

Just one course here on show here, sending you through a mess of pipes and collectible coins (oh, coins are back, but I'm not too sure what purpose they serve yet), reminding me instantly of Pilotwings Resort. 

You continue on up a *very* sheer rock face after landing, which I was happy about! 



**Super Mario 3D Land**

Wow. Fantastic. I was a bit worried about this one. I thought it may be an unoriginal rehash of Galaxy but I needn't have worried. I became concious after about 5 minutes of play that I was grinning like an idiot in a Nintendo ad the whole time! 

much of the game is reminiscent of a side scrolling Mario, and you can really see the depth of the 3D effect. This is used very cleverly for a few of the jumping sections! Star Coins were scattered through the 4 levels, and getting to them required addition dexterity. One thing I missed though was the backflip from Mario 64 (the triggers crouch, but alas, no backflip when you hit A). The return of Raccoon Mario made up for that though! 

Additionally, which I played so long ago I can't remember much about) but when they switched to Mario, they guy asked ""Which of the original NES Mario games did *not* feature Bowser as a boss? I put my hand up, the guy picked me and I answered ""Super Mario Bros. 2"" and I won a Zelda OOT3D lanyard, keyring and Ocarina! I've been tootling on the Ocarina all afternoon, driving the GF nuts in the process! :) 

I also got to share some Nintendo wisdom with some of the young teens there (I'm 27). I enthusiastically pimped LoZ OOT3D when one kid playing it seemed cynical about it. I asked him what games he normally plays and he said Call of Duty. As I groaned inwardly

Bought a little happiness to my heart there. 

**TL;DR The future of 3DS is bright**

1356809037.0,15mvta,3DS: There's just something about it. (long read),ericargyle,98,34,61,"So I'm wondering why there is this stigma involved when someone mentions the 3DS?  People tend to judge this system more than any other one I've seen, a bit of history on my part.

I started gaming at 5 with Karateka on my Atari 7800.  I then moved up to Mario Bros and Kid Icarus at 7, and finally Final Fantasy X and SOCOM II at 22, along with everything in between.  These were great systems, great platforms, and they were always offering something new; from colorful responsive platforming, to a true 3D polygonal experience, 4 player multiplayer on the same box, and it was happening on the games themselves

Blame this partly on life, etc.... but moreso, I blame it on the fact that those systems got stale, WERE stale even out of the box.  The Wii to me WAS a gimmick, a fad, something that should have been sold for $50 for the sports bundle, and Nintendo should have continued to make a real system with more traditional controls for their flagship titles.  I ended up giving up on gaming for a few years due to my dissatisfaction at the direction the controls took. After awhile, I thought I'd give the Wii a second shot and attempted playing Zelda: Twilight Princess and Metroid: Other M

PS3 was a similar, same exact controls, etc. etc. etc.  Normally this would be all good in my book (as with the new 2D Mario games), but so many times I saw the plot and gameplay suffer simply to spend more time on making the game look pretty.  There's nothing I can think of I've even demo'd on the PS3 that sticks in my memory as a moment of gaming greatness.

Moving on to the 3DS.  Last Christmas, my mother gifts me this little black system with Mario 3D land.  I boot it up and I am amazed, simply amazed.  The fact that I got the same feeling that I got while playing Mario 64 for the first time 15 years prior was astounding.  The graphics I was seeing, the fluidity of the gameplay, and the depth that was added with the 3D effect was awesome.  It was something that actually added a lot to the game itself.  I proceeded to put 24 hours into that game alone in the first month alone, more than I've played any game in that timeframe in the last 10 years.  Since then I've picked up Mario Kart 7, Zelda OOT, New Super Mario Bros 2

The difference I find in the 3DS is that it is the system I actually talk about publically, which we're both highly looking forward to.  To me, the thing with the 3DS is that I feel like it's the perfect mix of all the gaming that I've experienced in my life. It has the pure fun factor the older consoles offered, not so complicated, not so gimmicky, but with the added depth, network support, without even mentioning the portability.  I know people complain the eShop doesn't have enough games, you talk about it on these forums, this is a plus.  I also enjoy that I don't need added peripherals

I firmly believe the 3DS is the best system out now, Animal Crossing, and Smash Bros. will all offer something new and unique and at the same time familiar and comfortable that makes you remember why Nintendo has always been the company to beat when it comes to gaming.  I feel like a kid again when I'm playing it.

At the time I didn't think to file a police report because I honestly didn't think I would ever see it again. about a month ago I went ahead and replaced that 3ds with another one since there are more solid games out now and then just 2 days ago traded that in and got a 3dsXL. 

I went to register my XL on the Club Nintendo website and noticed that my original 3ds serial was saved from when I registered that so I emailed Nintendo and told them what happened and posted both serials in the email to see if there was a chance I could enjoy the ambassador program because I never got to before.

Initially they told me that if I emailed them a copy of the police report they would be happy to help me out. I told them that I never did that because I didn't think it would help. After a few emails exchanges later
and honestly thinking I wasn't going to get it because of the police report

After about a 30 minute phone call the person told me they wasn't going to be able to help me with much without a police report as not to damage the integrity of the program (which I understood) but said to give me a minute while he talked to his supervisor. When he came back on he said that his supervisor understood my situation and as a one time deal he would send the 'Nintendo Admins' my information and they would issue me an eShop code to unlock the program on my 3ds.

Its things like this that have kept me buying Nintendo products for as long as I could remember. Sure it was my fault and I honestly didn't think I was going to get it. But they worked with me and it was win win for both. I get to enjoy the 20 free games the program offers original 3ds owners and they continue having me as a happy customer! (even though I would probably still be buying their products if they denied me)
