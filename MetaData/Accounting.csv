To start

[**Here is the full guide provided in Google Docs**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10vZEI8_0rWePbVo0cIS6CWlM1sYbX0ywVsgIbokm2bk/edit?usp=sharing)

&gt;***Disclaimer***: This guide is based off of our experiences in the recruiting process and some aspects may differ at your school or region. The following is put together based on two schools in separate regions that are highly targeted by the Big 4 and regional public accounting firms. The information provided here is intended for your purposes to assist in the recruiting process only. *(If you would also like to offer advice, so I apologize if there is a delay or I am unable to answer all PMs. I encourage you to post here in order to allow others to help as well.



Part 1 - ***How to Prepare and Your School's Career Fair***

&gt;By now
 
&gt;&gt;**Prepared** Recruits &amp; **Unprepared** Recruits

&gt;This guide is provided to help inform you on how to best become a *prepared* recruit. Successful networking requires building a good rapport with firm representatives and this cannot be done by simply going to one or two events. The most prepared and successful recruits are the ones that go to every recruiting event. Firms pre-identify students through these events

***How to Prepare***

&gt;**Use your resources to the fullest** – Networking is all about building relationships. Use your professors, graduate students, accounting organizations, and school’s Career Management Center in order to learn how to prepare and create connections. This field is as much about the people you know as it is what you know. With this in mind, do not ask someone to pass along your résumé without getting to know them first, as that person will be vouching for you.

&gt;**Linkedin Account** – See the Google Doc for notes on this

&gt;**Join one or more student accounting organizations and get involved** – These organizations provide exclusive access and opportunities for firms to meet students and identify potential recruits. Firms are looking for well-rounded students in leadership positions on campus that is outside of the classroom. 

&gt;**Continuously improve your résumé** – Your résumé is always a work in progress and it never hurts to have others take a look at it. The more feedback you get

&gt;**Elevator Speech** – Have a well-rehearsed brief summary about yourself that lasts about 20-30 seconds. It is key to make a proper first introduction to professionals. State your name, expected graduation date, and position you are interested in (intern/full-time, tax/audit/advisory).

&gt;**Know your Goals** – You should have an idea of some of your short-term and long-term goals. For example, decide on the service line you want to go into, and where you want to be in 5-10 years.

&gt;**Be able to answer the question “Why Audit or Why Tax?”** – The firms are looking to see if you have put significant effort into deciding what you want to do with your career. While you probably do not know what you want to do for sure, Tax, and Undecided. Most only take into consideration two of those piles.

&gt;**Stay current with news about firms of interest** – Most firms will either frequently be cited in the news or actively post their own articles on their firm’s website. Be sure to keep up with this information to provide relevant conversation topics and show that you are interested in the firm.

&gt;**Professional Attire** – This topic is often talked to death, be sure to conceal tattoos and do not wear anything too revealing. When attending single firm events, try to match your attire with the firm’s colors, the firm representatives you meet will take noticed and be very impressed.

&gt;**Necessary Accessories** – There are a couple items you should consider having with you at smaller networking events, résumés are too obstructive to hand to professionals at each networking event. A simple business card providing your name, contact info, position you are interested in, and status in school is much more effective for smaller networking events. After you exchange business cards at the event, go home and e-mail the person you met with your résumé.

&gt;**Good Questions to Ask** - You should be asking thoughtful and engaging questions to learn more about the people you network with and their firms. Do not simply ask yes or no questions

&gt;&gt;•	Give me an example of a time you made a mistake and describe how your superiors dealt with it.

&gt;&gt;•	What does your firm do to prevent conflicting assignments for low level staff between two different supervisors?

&gt;&gt;•	Give me some examples of how your firm distinguishes itself from the competition.

&gt;&gt;•	What is one realistic thing you wish you could change about your job?

&gt;&gt;•	Does your firm's culture reward employees who get outside their comfort zone and take on new challenges


&gt;**Thank You Notes** – In most circumstances, they are likely to forget who you are and the connection you made will be lost. In the e-mail, it is good to ask a relevant question in order to create a dialogue. Be sure to review your emails multiple times for errors before sending them.

***Your School’s Career Fair***

&gt;All your preparation above is to succeed at the Career Fair. **Most firms, and prepare to network the entire time with recruiters and professionals. *The goal is to convince these people that you are someone they would like to work with.*

&gt;Do not go to your top choice of employers to start. Go to a couple firms you are not very interested in and use this as a chance to get warmed up. You are probably going to feel a little awkward and nervous standing around in a big convention center

2.	I have no idea why we continue to do this test but if I leave it out and we did it last year my reviewer is going to shit a brick.
3.	I don’t want to have to do a management letter either so if you could just stop fucking up it would be a lot less work for both of us.
4.	It’s not that your internal controls are deficient but I am pretty sure an 8 year old with a working knowledge of a keyboard could clear out your bank accounts in about 5 seconds.
5.	I don’t really care that the person who normally pulls that information is on vacation
6.	Oh you’re surprised that we need the exact same report we asked for last year? Well I am surprised that you were able to get both arms in your shirt this morning.
7.	Materiality is the short form of “I legally don’t have to give a shit”
8.	I understand that it took a lot of time to do the programs this year
9.	It is not my job to make your depreciation entries every year
10.	I understand that you are very busy and that the audit is time consuming and probably not at the top of your priority list but seeing as how I haven’t seen my wife and kids awake in 6 months I am going to need you to stop bitching and get what I asked now.

**Job**

Firm - Big 4 

Role - Audit 

Industy - Investment Management 

Level - Intern (Summer)

Location - NYC

Pay - ~26/hr

**Day in the life**

 8:00 Wake up

 8:30 Iron a white or blue button up shirt. Intern's should never be the worst

 8:45 Hop on the subway. It's the only place you'll see investment banking analysts sitting next to crackheads. 

 9:00 Get to the client's office. Head to our a tiny audit room with a beautiful view of Central Park. My team has 6 people

 9:05 Boot up my laptop and check to see if there's any new email. 

 9:10 Ask the senior if there's anything I can work on. He hands me a 4 inch pile of confirmations. I have make sure the information on each confirmation matches an excel document. If it doesn't I tell my senior and he looks into it. 

 12:00 Still working on confirmations

 12:30 Small talk with the associate. He says I'm lucky that it's not busy season. We talk about the Knicks. He's a cool guy.

 2:45 Finally finish confirmations. I ask the senior if there's anything else I can do. There isn't.

 3:00 The manager checks in. She's very polite to me

 4:00 After pretending to look busy for a while

 5:30 My senior says we can leave. Everyone makes the same jokes about how glad they are it isn't busy season. 

 6:00 - I get home and do some  combination of eating, walking around NYC, or going out for drinks with other interns.

Even the biggest idiots who don't know how to use Quickbooks

1) The cash deposits in the bank, she says the ""deposit"" from AMEX has cleared, to make the reconciliation of cleared transactions reconcile. Clearly something is off. In process of going through each month on this. AMEX doesn't make deposits. Thoughts?

2) She is taking 25% taxes from draws &amp; commissions paid for each employee (they pay mid month as a draw

3) Something is off with the vacation hours used by employees. Just discovered this. In Quickbooks

4) She has been asking about ""if anyone has been messing with quickbooks"" and suddenly is retiring... because ""she has been frugal all her life"" even though she is a part-time bookkeeper and clearly not retirement age. Also she ""caught"" the previous BKP embezzling through writing checks to himself. So she wont do it easy. And yes

5) TONS of voided transactions, an invoice is entered one month, paid the next and than deleted... lots....I tried to print out the audit trail for this year, and it was over 2,000 pages. 

I am currently working on a spreadsheet comparing deposits in checking and deposits in Quickbooks. I am also comparing the  time cards to the hours paid on the pay stubs (which by the way are way under. She isn't paying vacation time

I need your help fellow accounting peeps. Any suggestions on how to catch this thief!!!

* [Red Pencils](http://www.amazon.com/Ticonderoga-Erasable-Checking-Pre-Sharpened-13941/dp/B001BQTOW2/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361751670&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=red+pencils). This was from another thread here a couple days ago. Definitely helps with ticking and tying. 

* Some form of [programmable/gaming mouse](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Razer+-+Naga+2012+Expert+MMO+Laser+Gaming+Mouse+-+Black/5559544.p?id=1218661380065&amp;skuId=5559544&amp;st=gaming%20mouse&amp;cp=1&amp;lp=1). Having excel shortcuts programmed on your mouse makes formatting that much easier. 

* If your firm already doesn't provide you with one - a [second monitor](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Toshiba+-+21.5%26%2334%3B+Widescreen+LED+HD+Monitor/3775601.p?id=1218431547951&amp;skuId=3775601&amp;st=toshiba%20monitor&amp;cp=1&amp;lp=3). Helps with having your working paper and a reference document open at the same time. Most likely already provided to you.

* [Keypad](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Compucessory+-+Keypad/4498185.p?id=1218479692596&amp;skuId=4498185&amp;sellerId=34492929). Makes those number inputs a lot quicker.

* [Laptop riser](http://www.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/product/fellowes-fellowes-office-suites-laptop-riser-8032001-8032001/10176771.aspx?path=3e26ac1b275dae4f72813a8a97bd6b53en02). Raises the laptop to eye level

* [Privacy screen](http://www.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/product/hipstreet-hipstreet-7-netbook-privacy-screen-hs-nbscn7-hs-nbscn7/10157612.aspx?path=33e614714a2bff7411e82f2929df370cen02). So your client doesn't walk by and catch a gander of that top secret working paper/reddit thread.

* [Flu.x](http://stereopsis.com/flux/). When working late a night

* [Chair cushions](http://www.staples.com/Fellowes-Office-Suites-Mesh-Back-Support/product_645282). Can really help with back support and posture. Really important when you're spending 8

* [Caffeinated chocolate](http://www.awakechocolate.com/). Combines two great elements - energy and deliciousness. 

* [Keyboard wrist rest](http://www.kensington.com/kensington/us/us/p/1429/L22801US/wrist-pillow%C2%AE-keyboard-wrist-rest---black.aspx). 

* [Katmouse](http://download.cnet.com/KatMouse/3000-18491_4-24138.html). Helps make scrolling and switching between windows easier.

With the economy being weak the last several years, more students have been targeting degrees that give them financial security, which has created an influx in Accounting majors, making the field much more competitive.

That being said

**Here's the Pros and Cons I see with going the route of a Masters degree:**

***Pros***

* Allows for the highest level of recruitment opportunities. Firms target graduate programs harder than anywhere else and are focusing on hiring students with more education.

* Creates expert knowledge in your field

* MPA/MAcc Students - Prepares you for the CPA exam which greatly reduces study time necessary to pass each part.

* Increases promotion ability and demand for a higher salary

* Distinguishes your name, CPA, MTx). Clients will feel extra secure as well as feeling they are receiving more value knowing your advanced education accomplishments.

* Networking opportunities - You will meet other highly devoted individuals in similar situations

***Cons***

* The cost.

There is a significant number of benefits towards doing a Masters program, particularly in the Accounting program, you can work your way into becoming a GRA or GA and have tuition waived by the school. There are tons of scholarships out there as well that most people don't bother applying for. You wouldn't believe what the scholarship award rates are due to students not bothering to apply. Some scholarships are awarded to as many as 40-50% of those that apply.

So, but you need to consider what is the appropriate investment for the long-term. Do you want to take that avenue to reach 150 hours and later realize you want to go back for your Masters degree anyways? With the costs of education continuing to rise, this is something that requires serious thought. In decades past, education wasn't very expensive and it wasn't a big deal for a professional in the field for 10-15 years to decide they want to get their Masters. Today, it's a serious investment and something you may not be able to afford later in your career.

I have pretty horrible social anxiety and I swing in and out of major depression, both which I'm working on, I know a few people working for medium-sized firms and that seems almost as bad...I dunno



The problem is, for what it's worth. It's fun and challenging and I have a 4.0GPA within my major (and a 3.95 outside of it). I really loved cost accounting and I loved both intermediate accounting classes (somehow). I mean, strangely enough, I like journal entries. Preparing statements. Balances and ledgers. I like different inventory costing methods and budgets and their variances and work-in-process inventory and spoilage and other cost-accounting things I can't remember. I certainly liked doing those things a lot more than what audit and tax taught me (though tax was pretty fun, too). Professor anecdotes that begin with, ""When I was working at Dow chemical..."" interest me a lot more than, ""When I was working at Deloitte..."" But who are the people who do that in the company? My mind gets stuck on ""bookkeeper"" or ""clerk"" and then my mind gets stuck on ""$10/hour part-time summer job with no room to advance"" and ""good luck living on $10 an hour


I dunno. Maybe it's just the public bias I've been taught by this subreddit and my school. Maybe I'm overthinking this, is more reasonable than I think. It's just...how? Where? For what position? I've been taught online applications are black holes for public accounting firms and the only way to get a job is career fairs, but what if it's not a public accounting firm? I guess I should head to the ""general"" career fair rather than the accounting one and hand out some resumes and try to speak to people and hope for the best? 


I guess at this point I'm just kind of ranting and rambling...so I'll end it here. **tl;dr: no public

And Arthur Andersen said --- nothing you idiots Arthur Andersen’s dead

“yeah but they’re so efficient though” Yeah we probably got a couple of screws up in our head loose
But it’s no worse than what’s goin on inside your board room
Sometimes
But we can’t

My rec is on your lips
You might just give me a little tip
Of course you’re gonna make me adjust entries
We ain’t nothin but camels
But if we can balance budgets and fudge it through the audit
Auditor can’t get hope

If ya feel like I feel I got the antidote

You know, let alone understand us. 
But auditing, so you guys can just lie to keep me here, and sit me here next to Britney Spears, yo you know she needs an audit better switch me chairs, so I
Can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst

I should download his audio on MP3 and show the whole world how we do our 1120’s
I’m sick of you little interns all you do is annoy me so I have been sittin here to destroy you
And there’s a million of us just like me,
Walk talk and act like me and might just be the next best thing

(chorus – 2x)

The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y’all and I don’t gotta
Be false and sugarcoat it all
I just get on Excel and hit it

“well how can firms take on these workloads in truckloads?” It’s funny

Crying to myself while outlook isn’t working
The internet and isn’t working
And every single person is an accountant lurking 
He could be working around your state
Or checking out your LIBOR rate
Or in the parking lot
Screaming “I NEED A BALL POINT PEN”

And be proud to be out of your house and under control one more time

1362154782.0,19gveh,Life changing career descision,Pooryid,28,2,53,"I have recently come across a life changing career opportunity and have no idea which route to take. Currently

The opportunity I have in front of me is through my first accounting job. I worked for this guy who owned a business selling computer and electronic related hardware online. They now selling pretty much everything and have grown from a $4 million dollars in revenue a year company when I left 3 years ago to a $24 million dollar company. I left that company because I needed to focus on school and also get different experience within accounting. 

Now the McGladrey position is a good job. It has good salary, and there is growth. But my god, it is boring and not something I have passion for at all. I met with my old boss from the old company and he wants me back. Essentially, he wants to bring me up to a position that acts like a CFO. He never had a great accounting system going on. When he hired me, I was his first accountant and I set up quickbooks for him. Now he wants me back and have me take on roles that oversee the finances, accounting, and investments of the firm. This is something I’ve always wanted to do and is a great opportunity. The salary will be paying more than my current job after the first 90 days and the potential to make a lot more quickly along possible with equity in the firm. The biggest benefit and what I want most out of a job is to take ownership of my work and be part of something where I can help make it grow. I want that passion where I can wake up every morning with a purpose and I feel like this new career will take me to that place. 

The problem is that I have is that if I do make this switch, I am not that experienced. I may have had two tax jobs and some other accounting internships but I will make a lot of mistakes. My old boss knows this and says he will bring me up to be where I need to be because he sees potential in me.

What do you think Reddit? Should I stick with McGladrey through this storm or should I make that life-changing and risky career decision that can leader to a happier life and potentially more $$?

I asked him if he needed some time to get ready for our meeting, and he told me that he was fine.  I proceeded to have our meeting over his finances, tax liability, etc for the next hour while sitting at his glass (see-through) table.  I kept trying to place files to cover his crotch region, but he kept shifting and getting up and down.

2) I then went to his ex-wife's place to do the same.  Long story short, the buttons started to come undone and one of her sweater cows started to work their way out...

**Statement of Cash Flows:**

1. GAAP you can use either the indirect or direct method

2. For GAAP Interest X

**Construction contracts:**

1. GAAP uses either percentage of completion OR completed contracts method

**Income Statement:**

1. GAAP has a separate classification for ""extraordinary items"" that must be reported net of tax beneath net income. In IFRS no such classification exists.

**Inventory:**

1. GAAP can choose between LIFO and FIFO

2. Under GAAP inventory is carried at lower of cost or replacement cost

3. Under GAAP inventory write-downs cannot be reversed. For IFRS if the reasons for the impairments no longer exist

**Current vs. Non-Current:**

1. GAAP can report current liabilities as long term if a refinancing agreement exists prior to the issuance of the balance sheet. For IFRS a refinancing agreement must exist prior to the balance sheet date to qualify as non-current

**Asset Valuation:**

1. For GAAP the revaluation of assets is prohibited. For IFRS

2. In GAAP you rarely see component depreciation. For IFRS component depreciation is mandatory for assets where different components depreciate in different ways

3. IFRS has a separate classification for ""biological assets"" (living animals and plants)

**Gains and Losses:**

1. Under GAAP a loss contingency is accrued only if the loss is PROBABLE and the amount is reasonably estimable. For IFRS the loss only needs to be more likely than not to be accrued

2. When a contingent loss is judged to be probable within a range of amounts and no number within that range is viewed as more likely

**Costs:**

1. R&amp;D costs are expensed under GAAP

2. Under GAAP costs incurred defending an intangible asset are capitalized as part of the intangible. Under IFRS they are expensed as incurred

**Bonds:**

1. Under IFRS any amount extra that is received for a bond because of its convertibility is recorded as equity rather than as a liability. According to GAAP

2. Under GAAP debt issue costs are put into an asset account and amortized over the life of the bond. Under IFRS

**Leases:**

1. To be a capital lease under GAAP one of the (TT, 90) test must be met. To be a capital lease under IFRS the lease term must only consist of a ""significant portion"" of the assets useful life. This is a lower standard than GAAP

2. For capital leases under IFRS both the lessor and the lessee must use the interest rate implicit in the agreement. Under GAAP the lessee can use the incremental borrowing rate as his interest rate. This means that under GAAP the lessor ant the lessee can book different interest rates for the same transaction.

3. Under GAAP if the fair value of the land component of a lease is greater than 25% of the total lease,False,self,t5_2qw2b,False,,student,t3_p0zwj

I go to a large

Now here's my disclaimer/credentials combo. I'm an upcoming fourth year in a five year program. Some of you may scoff at my inexperience, got it, and got an internship offer directly after the program. I can now basically chill for the next two years. 

Without further ado

**1. Resume Booster:** The obvious benefit of BAP is the fact that it's another line on your resume. Depending on how loaded your resume is, committee member or head, or mentor), all it really will be is something to list under ""Activities"" as a member. That said, I believe most firms are aware of the responsibilities that come with being a member, and look highly upon it even without being in a leadership role. 

On that point, or mentors shows an added level of responsible. We all know that correlation does *not* equal causation, but I can say that at one of my Big 4 pre-interview dinners, there was 1 out of ~15 students that wasn't in BAP, and they were in the student accounting society.

**2. Information About Career Paths:** While many of us simply learned through online research the path we wanted to take (small firm vs big firm, many students in my chapter weren't so sure. We held meetings based on these topics, where older students would outline the differences, share experiences, and answer questions.

**3. Resume Workshops, we have several resume workshops that were quite helpful, especially if you are just looking for the ""finishing touches"" for your resume. If you have a great resume that you may just want a few pointers for, why not have a senior manager at EY (or a small firm, we have those too, just an example) look over it, and have them see how great your resume is? If your resume is weaker

The interview workshops tend to be more just presentations than interactive workshops, and we bring out companies that don't really hire recent grads. This takes off the pressure of screwing up, and allows you to learn from the experience. I did one and it was an *incredible* confidence booster.

**4. Network With Your Peers:** BAP gives you a fantastic opportunity to get helpful tips on recruiting, and everything in between from people who have been there, done that. Wanna know if you really need the book for an upcoming class? Trying to decide between audit and tax? Looking to go out of market and not sure where to start? There is almost definitely someone who would be more than willing to help. And my awesome job on campus where I set my own hours, work between classes, do homework when its slow, and get a bunch of fancy responsibilities for my resume to go with it at $11/hr? Got it with the help of my BAP mentor who was leaving for a Big 4. 

One other thing that people may forget that I think is important. When you surround yourself with motivated people, and it makes you push yourself to be that much better. I know my outlook changed when I realized that I wasn't the only one with great grades and work experience.

**5. Network With Professionals:** Almost every week, but we also have private. That means every single week members get a chance to hear from people who work at a firm they may be interested in, and more importantly, get a chance to network with them at the post-meeting social. You'd be surprised how candid some of these professionals and recruiters are, and you will learn a lot. The two main benefits, IMO, come from getting to know people who may be interviewing you on a first name basis, so you don't stutter at the Career Fair/Meet the Firms when it really counts. 

To speak a little more to the point of getting to know the recruiters, I had already spoken with some recruiters several times, and was much more comfortable around them. I ended up going to several SLP programs and getting internship offers. While I obviously could only accept one (which was out of market where I really wanted to go), I now feel that I am in good standing enough with a Partner at another firm that if things didn't work out, I could still have a great shot at the other firm. 

I hope this was helpful for those of you on the fence about BAP or a similar organization, especially with my goal of going out of market.

*CICA and CMA Canada have set January 1, the national organization that will support provincial bodies that have unified, and all those that will unify, under the CPA banner. The initial members of CPA Canada will be CICA and CMA Canada. Provincial bodies (and their members) will become members of CPA Canada as they complete their process to become a CPA body.*

*Establishment of a national body for Canada's CPA profession is a significant step forward. Work is underway on development of the structure and by-laws for the new national body, will be integrated within CPA Canada. CICA and CMA Canada will remain in place until such time as all national operations are transferred to CPA Canada (expected in 2013) and all provincial organizations have completed the necessary process to unify under the CPA banner, which could take several years.*

*Creation of CPA Canada ensures that its top priority, with the first CPA exams offered in the fall of 2015. The CPA competency map and supporting educational requirements will be released shortly.*

*More information will be shared with members as plans and timelines for establishing CPA Canada are developed.*

*Sincerely

*Kevin Dancey
*President and CEO*

I'm not 100% clear what is going on.  I personally think it degrades the work we put in to get to our position versus the CMA. Sure they'll differentiate it now

Just wanted to know what others opinion is on this.

For those not familiar

CA (Chartered Accountant) - Authorized to sign audits. Much more education required

CMA (Certified Managerial Accountant) - Commonly the 'company accountant' type position. Can get through with university and college courses.

CGA (Certified General Accountant) - Commonly a 'personal accountant' that handles compilations and reviews.

I would like to thank each of you for your interest in the post, and I will not consider it legal advice or counsel; instead, solely as friendly opinions and points of discussion. I would prefer that opinions be supported with accredited sources when applicable. Again, thank you all for your incite and perspectives, trust that all information you can provide will be taken to heart. 

**Background:**

I am a senior undergraduate accounting major at a small, in which I work directly under the CFO/Treasurer/EVP of Finance, the Director of Risk Management/Assistant VP of Finance, and the Director of Compliance and Tax Issues. Additionally, I am currently wrapping up my 150 with plans to sit for all four sections of the CPA during the summer, after I graduate in May. Following my graduation, I have an offer to begin in the fall with a CPA firm as an auditor; I previously worked as a tax/audit intern with the firm. That firm currently audits the financial statement of the university of which I am employed and attend, though a different office than that which I would be employed and with a different partner than that I would work under.

**Situation:** 

Within the past week I became aware that a number of professors at my university, issued to the IRS and disclosed to the public) and the possibility of a number of illegal accounting activities, as a result of management fraud. Specifically, to the best of my knowledge, the group of professors believes that three identifiable frauds may be occurring: misstatements in the 990 compensation disclosures, misrepresentations in the 990 treatment of our art collection, and the unlawful and fraudulent use of proceeds from the sale of assets included in that art collection. 

Firstly, but rather the related yes or no questions. I have no knowledge to suggest this accusation has any merit and have very limited knowledge as to the evidence or knowledge being used by the group of professors unofficially investigating the issue. 

However, under that new management the university decided that the art collection should be liquidated and assigned the accounting professor mentioned previously, along with others, to investigate how to go about the liquidation process. He informed me that he recommended that the university’s only options were to either reinvest the proceeds back into the art collection or donate the collection to a not-for-profit which could be better suited for the collection. He also informed me that the following year the art collection was no longer shown on the 990.

Since the conversation, I have compared the audited financial statements against the 990 to confirm that the art collection still exists, and is shown as “Art Collection” on the audited financials, but shown as “Other” under the Part VI disclosure of the Schedule D attached the 990. Additionally, the 990 has a series of questions and additional disclosures related to art collections, these are either unanswered or answered in contrary to the existence of an art collection on the 990. My understanding of the instructions regarding the 990 would require alternative answers to those provided by management in the case of our art collections, and the purpose with which they were donated and had been capitalized and recognized. 

Today I was informed by one of my direct supervisors that I would be involved in the liquidation of some of the university’s art. I asked him what purpose the university was planning on using the proceeds of the sale of the pieces for and he informed me that the funds would be uses as general revenue and would go into our general fund without restrictions. Also

**Request for Advice:**

I would appreciate any additional understanding you could pass onto me regarding the proper treatment of these items and please correct any misunderstanding I may have regarding the regulations and laws related. 

I am looking for advice regarding how best to handle the situation in general. It is important to me that I uphold the code of conduct of the AICPA and avoid any unlawful and unethical actions during the remainder of my employment at the university. 

My university does have a whistleblower policy which I will be forced to utilize if I find any substantive evidence of fraud; I would appreciate any incite as to when/if you think I should use this. 

What disclosures am I required, or prohibited from making to my department, the professors, and my CPA firm which audits the university?

What would you do in my situation?

Any other advise you think would be useful. 

**Current Opinion:**

I am currently leaning toward a course of action which will try and avoid involvement in the situation. I believe that I should make my supervisors aware of the restrictions and regulations related to art collections and inform them of my opinions regarding 990 disclosures related to art collections. Also, I do not believe I can inform the CPA firm of any of this because it is confidential information I acquired outside of my employment with them. 

**Conclusion:**

Thank you again for your input and concern. I truly appreciate any insight you all can offer and will consider it thoroughly. As I am sure you all can see, supervisors, and professors all intimately involved. As stated above I would prefer any references to creditable sources when available just because of the nature of reddit and the fact that I may have to support my positions in the future if an investigation ensues.

There currently exists a gap between the public's perception of an audit opinion and what an auditor is actually responsible for. This can present a liability for audit firms as client's shareholders attempt to pursue reparations for losses. 

[History of the Expectations Gap](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/75590686/Articles/Towards%20an%20Understanding%20of%20the%20Expectations%20Gap.pdf) - I would recommend reading the first part of this academic paper as it defines the phrase ""Expectations Gap"" and gives  a short history.

[GOA](http://blogs.smeal.psu.edu/grumpyoldaccountants/archives/498#more-498) - The grump old accountants give their opinion on the problem of the expectations gap. They point to some good studies on the subject (one of which is the history study linked above).

[PCAOB](http://pcaobus.org/Rules/Rulemaking/Docket034/Concept_Release.pdf) - This is a link to the PCAOB's concept release for the revised audit opinion. This is critical reading for this discussion.

Some questions to help you get the creative juices flowing:

Does the responsibility for understanding the audit opinion fall on the public

Since audits are a function of risk-based cost/benefit

What is your opinion on the PCAOB concept release? Try to touch on some of the alternatives presented in the release (AD&amp;A, Clarification of language).

I'm the only accountant for the company.

In speaking with her and explaining that I need backup documents for what the check was for, she specifically mentioned to me that it was a reimbursement for a political contribution.  I'm still learning quite a bit in accounting, so I nonchalantly put it in our ""Contributions"" account and went on my way.

About a week later I get a phone call from the CFO, and bonuses had already been paid for the year.  I relented to the CFO's request, but placed a note on the transaction that this was originally communicated to me as being a political contribution.

The check was cut and I delivered it to the CEO personally.  He seemed surprised that he got the check

An example is of today's payroll that I'm processing. We have a salaried employee who is the supervisor for our field technicians. He managed to complete his work

I have another employee who doesn't want me to put down how many hours she actually worked because she's hourly and would have gotten some overtime (which her manager knew about). She doesn't want to piss off the owner so she reduced the amount of hours that she worked on the timesheet she turned in to me.

Being the person involved with the books and the more behind the scenes aspects of the company lets you see a lot about the company that maybe your other coworkers aren't exposed to. How do you keep yourself from getting disheartened at your job if your boss or supervisors are doing questionable things? Do you just suck it up as that's the way it is? Are there any techniques you use to disconnect yourself from the crappy way your coworkers are treated? Or do you just find an employer that treats their employees well?

I apologize for the length and content of this post

I graduated with my bachelor's almost a year ago and have had almost no luck finding a job, who realized it wasn't nearly as serious a situation as initially presented, I was allowed to plead guilty to the misdemeanor charge instead, which is the lowest level computer-related statute on the books in my state.  The sentence for this crime was 3 yrs of probation, 250 hours of community service and sex offender counseling. Since the probation was completed in 2009, I have not had any contact with any law enforcement office and am not required to register for any sort of list.

After taking several years off school during this ordeal, however, my GPA dating back to my initial college time after high school is a 3.1.  I have also recently taken the GMAT and received a score of 660, with perfect scores on the writing and reasoning sections as well.

I have a had a few part time, all in industry or finance) only to be turned down because of this charge specifically.

I have since applied for a pardon from the state, it is a pardon and not an expungement of the record itself.

I have been in contact with my desired graduate program, but the director of the program has concerns that it will impede me from finding placement, which I share.  I am planning to begin next Fall, several months after I hopefully hear good news about the pardon application.

I am considering attending a MACC Program because it will help me collect the remaining credits for the CPA exam and will also be the first step toward my ultimate goal of one day teaching at the college level.

Here are my questions:

1.  I am concerned that I will never escape this charge, I'm screwed?

2.  I have tried to be as open and honest about this at interviews as possible.  Any thoughts on how I should present it?

3.  Is the simple passage of time working in my favor?  Is there a point at which this charge just doesn't show up any more?  How far back do firms check backgrounds for a misdemeanor level charge?  The most recent industry job I applied and interviewed for listed 7 years for a misdemeanor charge on their paperwork.  Is this standard?

&gt;So for me I can put that I was a ""Tax Accountant"" at XXX and a ""Senior Accountant"" at my current company because I was working in internal accounting departments but I can't post those titles anywhere else. I am also allowed to put down that I am a ""CPA Candidate"" on a resume but not anywhere else.  Again I can only put it on my resume if it is given directly to the company of a job I am applying for.   You can not post those titles on any public forum including online job boards.  Also I was told that private companies should not be issuing business cards with internal job tittles on them if they have the words ""accountant"" or ""auditor"" on them and they are not a CPA.  Not an issue for me I haven't had business cards since I worked at YYY but I have lots of friends who are not CPA and have business cards with their job title on them.

Personally, they probably deserve what they're going to get.

To start: I graduating with accounting this semester, where I reside.

Here's where it gets a bit complicated: I'm not really ""good"" at accounting. I'm not sure I'm gonna get any sympathy from this subreddit but I just SUCK at it. I don't hate it, everything just ""clicked"" for them; for me, I really struggled to understand all the concepts, and only after reviewing for hours over the same problem, did I begin to understand. I'm really envious of people who are able to say that accounting is such an easy field. 

Anyway, I'm starting to worry. I've worked for a small local firm, and the boss was really patient with me, because embarrassingly enough, it took me twice as long compared to my co-workers to really get it. But eventually I do, it's just harder for me. 

Now I'm just at the point where I'm convincing myself that I will be able to move further--to complete the extra courses successfully and even pass the CPA exam, I don't know. So there's that.

So my question is, I know for a fact that I won't regret it if I have a license; it's just the part of getting there. I don't think I can emphasize this enough: I'm terrible at everything accounting and tax related, but I don't hate it and I really want to have a good future as a CPA. Is that motivation enough? Is there a time where being a CPA is just plain wrong and not worth it? Am I just delusional?

I've been in my accounting program for a few months and runs for a total a bit over 2 years, my mom pushed me into this program earlier than I had wanted. I wanted to take another year off to sort out my life and to experience my life and youth before jumping into the the workforce (to be fair I only fully acknowledged that about 6 months before the program started). I feel as though my youth and life are just down the drain.

I'm doing well in the program but it takes up almost all my time. I have class all day and I have at least 2-3 tests/assignments due every single week as well as at least 1 recruiting event every week. 

I really feel miserable. I feel like I'm doing this and I'm not even sure I want to be in the program. I know that even if I don't want to be an accountant, UFE, Co-op, etc.) and probably for the rest of my life.

I'm not an underachiever, kind of like a puzzle, but I don't know if it's right for my profession. And the truth is, if you guys think that all this work now is going to make life easier for me later on then I'm on board to do it. But I need to know. Does everyone feel like this? Or do most of you at least want to be accountants? I don't even care about being excessively rich in my life, as long as I make a good living and I'm comfortable, I'd rather enjoy what I do and lead a happy life. Will all this be worth it in the end? Is the work I put in at this age going to lead to a happier adult life (more free time as an adult because of financial security, etc.) or is it going to be this life-consuming for the next 30 years?


_______________________________________________________________________________
TL:DR -  I'm in an accounting program and I'm doing well but I don't know if its for me. I don't want a job that consumes my entire life (like this program does right now and I assume will for the next 5 years). Is working hard now worth the long term happiness or is my accounting career going to take up most of my time for the next 20 years of my life? Am I wasting my youth on something I don't want to do?

The latter goal will be the most important part. The FAQ will be featured more prominently in the sidebar and on the submission page. However

**Let me go over those points again before I direct you to how to begin editing:**

* Easy to read and navigate.
* Answers should be as comprehensive as possible yet
* Compact - unnecessary fluff, and overly extensive answers that could be made more compact by providing additional reading are not needed
* Accurate

Keep in mind that a large majority of readers are students

For now this is going to be organized on the side via a Google Doc. **This document is editable by anybody

**This is a collaborative project in progress.** If you come up with a good question to add, get feedback first using comments.** You may write your version below theirs and highlight it as a ""possible better alternative answer"" in another colour. There is also a commenting function so that you can highlight and add a comment to sections you want to provide/get feedback on. 

I would suggest you make a copy of your own answers locally. Someone may decide to replace your answer without your input and you might not notice until the final revision is being looked over. There will be a final proofread

I sat for the REG portion of the exam in January and recently found out I scored a 57.  I had taken the self-study Becker Review Course but caught the flu over the holidays which inhibited my study time.  Also before I became ill I found myself wanting to put off studying or take breaks throughout (when I'm overwhelmed I tend to put things off which then makes me feel worse and the cycle continues).  I know if I apply myself that I can pass but receiving such a low score has me worried.  Do I have a decent chance of obtaining a passing score from a 57 if I become more dedicated?  Also

I also find myself nervous in general about the accounting professional.  I graduated with a pretty good GPA (3.88) but I just feel like I don't know nearly what I should.  My biggest fear is arriving at a job and being expected to know something of which I have no idea.  My professors were nice people but had a hard time breaking the material down to a level that was easy to comprehend.

Being a tax person primarily

At the moment, we like our standards to provide a bright line test for how a transaction should be treated. For example, I remember leases from Intermediate II being a pretty good case (which may have been resolved by now). GAAP provides a very strict test for whether to expense or capitalize (I don't remember exactly but it's like 80% of the FMV of the assets or 75% of the useful life). IFRS, if I recall correctly, said something like, ""If the lease terms show that you substantially control the asset, then capitalize, the US doesn't deal with ambiguity like this very well.

This is my first accounting job, and try my best to get it right before I give it to the partner. Him telling me to spend less time on it AND mentioning that I haven't been very productive just encourages me to do a half-assed quick job to just hand in. But that brings problems too, it takes more of his time when it comes to review.

I worked in retail and food service for the past 8 years of my life. You come to work, and clock out to go home. There's no intermediary bullshit of having to manipulate your hours so the client's bill isn't too high. How do you guys deal with partner's upset by this? I'm growing increasingly frustrated having to bullshit my hours and basically take 1/3rd of it and allocate it to ""training"" since I have to spend time LEARNING what it is I am doing.

I refuse to eat more hours than necessary. A few months ago I was talked to about my hours since I was eating lunch quickly at my desk for 10 minutes and continuing to work

Meanwhile the culture of my office is that nobody really goes out and disappears for that amount of time. My coworkers encourage me to ""go on facebook"" and mess around for the break
