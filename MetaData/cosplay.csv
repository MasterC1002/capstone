I am hoping to find an Iron Man Cosplayer near Southeastern Kentucky who could visit a little boy named Cameron.  He has down syndrome.  He's a sweetheart and **loves** Iron Man.

If we can't find one who can come to KY

We do our best to make the Christmas Magic happen for kids all around the world.  This is our second year running. This little guy did not ask for toys

**Update:**  Iron Man found!  Thank you so much to MartyJMcFly.  I appreciate everyone who commented and messaged me.  This is going to make one little guy so so happy!  But I do have an idea that I'd like to run by all of you cosplayers and it involves cosplay and videos for other kids who have all sorts of heroes.  It would be an epic Christmas present,,False,self,t5_2qkju,1351991290.0,,True

Everyone told me to make my plea at /r/cosplay 

Here is the original [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/cosplay/comments/12k8oj/request_iron_man_cosplayer_are_you_out_there_can/).

I was overwhelmed with the offers I received on someone playing Cameron's Iron Man.  But I could only choose one.  Hardest decision of my life!

[This awesome guy answered the call to arms

After gathering a few facts on Cameron from his parents

[Here is the video that Iron Man made for Cameron.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8Jkjtol7_o)

Well, too.

[Here is Cameron's reaction.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFGL_sPsOWY&amp;feature=youtu.be)  His father told me that Cameron rarely makes facial expressions

And you know what made this even better?  Cameron made a [reply video to his favorite superhero.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJE2IkiXbNA&amp;feature=youtu.be)
