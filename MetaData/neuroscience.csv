I will post a observations I have had regarding the article. Feel free to comment on either the article or my points. Remain civil and have fun. 

This study is somewhat of a meta review of the literature and publishing process examining how findings get misinterpreted in the media. This is an issue that has impacted anyone who has published a paper before

The authors examined 360 recent studies on ADHD for 2009 and earlier. The first thing I found interesting was the correlation between impact factor and type 2 overstatements. We all look at top tier publishing as the only way to be successful in the field

The article mentioned several potential cause of data misinterpretation

&gt; More generally
between authors to publish in high rank journals and between
journal editors distorts publication of biomedical research in favor
of sensationalism

&gt; Therefore
institutional demand and to preferentially publish positive results.
Even when they are published
established dogma are often ignored both by the scientific
literature and by the media as exemplified here

Finally the article attempts to offer some solutions. 

1. ""First
more studies analyzing the neuroscience discourse""

2. ""Second

3. ""Third
of research grants without any link to therapeutic applications.""

I personally find it interesting looking at the source of this study, but the authors conclusions in a journal of this type seem to create a posible data misinterpretation of its own. I think it is very important to echo the limitation that this quantitate data does not apply fields in neuroscience, as the focus in on ADHD, but I think the results can be more universal.

I study neurobiology and am currently preparing my diploma thesis (yes, computational approaches play an increasingly important role in all kinds of sub-branches of neuroscience. Being primarily a biologist, however, my knowledge regarding programming, advanced mathematcial concepts ect. is very limited. I have a working understanding of data processing of EEG and fMRI data, programming in MATLAB and a basic grasp on graph theory. 

I currently work on a project involving functional network analysis

So my question is: How do you think someone with a limited background as myself can get into research that focuses on computational neuroscience? Would it make sense to add another bachelor in for example computer science? Is it possible to reach a more extensive understanding by simply working through textebooks and papers? And

[Sequencing the Connectome] (http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001411)


**Abstract:**

Connectivity determines the function of neural circuits. Historically, a method for converting the problem of connectivity into a form that can be read out by high-throughput DNA sequencing. The appeal of using sequencing is that its scale—sequencing billions of nucleotides per day is now routine—is a natural match to the complexity of neural circuits. An inexpensive high-throughput technique for establishing circuit connectivity at single neuron resolution could transform neuroscience research.

I recently received funding to do some research over the summer at my university investigating the role of mirror neurons in intergroup bias
We're going to do this by measuring mirror neuron activity while deriving the emotions of in/out-group members before and after the participants memorize 50 outgroup names and faces. We need about 100-200 photos of males of white

Thing is, needs to be remedied asap.

Some super-summarized background of things we know/things that are strongly implied about mirror neurons/empathy: 

* Mirror neurons are neurons that fire both when you perform an action, but someone else. This equates the experience of empathy. 

* Your in-group is a group that you more closely identify with as compared to an out-group (and changes depending on the most important defining factor in a given context). For example, your in-group is Muslim and your out-group is any other religion. If you're a professor, your in-group is other professors...you get it.

* It has been shown that mirror neuron response is lower for out-group members based on various distinctions
 
* It has been shown, relate to, and identify with them, correspondingly increasing empathy. 

* Children with autism (which results in a reduced ability to understand social cues and empathize with others) exhibit significantly reduced mirror neuron activity when observing others compared to unaffected children.

* People are more able/likely to dissociate from someone the less they are able to identify with them. I suspect this to be a requirement for groups of people to rationalize war with others.


We hypothesize that an increased experience of empathy with exposure to others is the result of the mirror neuron system having increased practice differentiating, stereotyping). We therefore predict that exposure to out-group features and social cues (such as emotional expressions) may decrease intergroup bias.

So my question is: would you be willing to donate a picture of your face for this study and/or other research that involves visual stimuli? Would you be willing to have it compiled into a database for use by other researchers?

**If so

* It would be awesome if you could snap one or more frontal photos of yourself making various emotional expressions--smiling, scared, neutral, or really anything--from the shoulders up. We can photoshop out the background, but no hands touching your face please. 

* For my study we're in critical need of black male faces

If I get any kind of response

A bit of background. I graduated from a mediocre school in 2009. While there I got very mediocre grades but eventually ended up with a degree in economics. For most of my life I have excelled in classes I enjoy and did poorly in classes “I didn't see the point in"". (Big mistake I know, I lacked passion. 

It took a long time, 2 years of ""real world"" work, and a plethora of books I have finally boiled down all my interests and curiosities to one thing. I have discovered a passion for understanding why people make the decisions that they make at the most basic level.

I am trying to reach out to as many outlets for advice as possible

Some things I have thought of that may be options/helpful.

Should I go get another BS in neuroscience?

Should I apply to grad schools as is?  

Should I try and get a job doing something remotely related and then apply? 

Should I try and go somewhere where I can try and cross disciplines (neuroeconomics?) 

Should I dedicate a bunch of time to say

Some important factors:

I have the money to go back to school.  In fact

I have the time and drive to really give this 110%.  I know it is what I want to do.

I’d go anywhere in the world to do this.

My grades are, volunteering as an English teacher in in South East Asia and South America, writing freelance, taking tons of classes online, learning Chinese and Spanish, and doing some data analysis in new york for a continuing education website. 

So let it rip. I'm open to everything.

**Abstract**: 

The organization of computations in networks of spiking neurons in the brain is still largely unknown, which can explain a large number of macroscopic experimental data in neuroscience and cognitive science. But it has turned out to be surprisingly difficult to create a link between these abstract models for stochastic computations and more detailed models of the dynamics of networks of spiking neurons. Here we create such a link and show that under some conditions the stochastic firing activity of networks of spiking neurons can be interpreted as probabilistic inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Since common methods for MCMC sampling in distributed systems, such as Gibbs sampling, are inconsistent with the dynamics of spiking neurons, we introduce a different approach based on non-reversible Markov chains that is able to reflect inherent temporal processes of spiking neuronal activity through a suitable choice of random variables. We propose a neural network model and show by a rigorous theoretical analysis that its neural activity implements MCMC sampling of a given distribution, both for the case of discrete and continuous time. This provides a step towards closing the gap between abstract functional models of cortical computation and more detailed models of networks of spiking neurons.

**I)** If you have a DICOM file: Transfer this to nifti
If you have a PAR/REC file: Transfer into nifti format (e.g. using r2aGUI


**II)** Read nifti with SPM8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/)

a) Use Segment option to tear apart white from gray matter. Batch Editor interface; SPM &gt; Spatial &gt; Segment; default values are OK

b) check with MRIcroGL (http://www.cabiatl.com/mricrogl/) if you’ve got a good volume matrix (not a mesh yet!)


**III)** Read nifti in ITK-snap (http://www.itksnap.org/download/snap/register.php?link=5075&amp;root=nitrc)

a)  Open grayscale image

b) Click on the ‘Snake ROI tool’ in the Main Toolbox window (top left); click ‘Segment 3D’; choose segmentation on the basis of ‘intensity regions’

c) Step 2 involves placing bubbles in your brain which will be used as point from where brain and no-brain volumes will be rendered. I found placing the bubbles outside the brain yield the easiest .stl files to read in Meshlab. Place the bubbles, and will not get all the detail from your SPM model. 

d) Now go to Segmentation &gt; Export as surface mesh

NB: ITK-Gray seems to be doing a better job at this


**IV)** Read .stl in Meshlab (http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/)

a) Simplify your model

b) Waterproof your model: normals, (however, I’m stuck at this step as I’m a neuroscientist, not a 3D modeller)

**V)** Check your model with MiniMagics (http://www.materialise.com/MiniMagics) to make sure your model will be printable by an average 3d printer. If there is any error


**VI)** You’ll now have a .stl file which will be accepted by the majority of 3D-printers. (If no printer is near
HOWEVER: make sure that you have 1 object and not many by checking it in 3D-print software (e.g. ZPrint for a ZCorps 3D-printer); my model had multiple objects in the middle (e.g. ventricles) which I could not remove myself, then select the inverse and press delete.


**VII)** PROFIT; for you are now able to

One of the techniques the school uses to build-up reading ability is to have the student wear an eye-patch over their left eye while they read.

I have never studied much neuroinformatics before

1. Physiological method: where researchers use laser scanning photo-simulation to determine connectivity
2. Electron Microscopy: pretty self explanatory and clearly takes a great deal of time
3. GRASP method which uses fluorescent proteins (much like Brainbow)

The manuscripts purposes a new method called 'BIONIC', apparently rabies does this). So these barcodes grow and grow, and you are able to see the neurons connected to a specific neuron by looking at the barcode and working backwards. The main reason why this becomes so beneficial, is because the cost of sequencing DNA has dropped DRAMATICALLY and continues each year. It seems the author is trying to take advantage of this.

The thing I like most about this manuscript is the application of critical thinking to better solve a problem. It is a very clever method to work around what becomes a difficult problem. I am a little concerned, and the chance that the sequence does not get passed on increases with size. Does anyone know if this has been done successfully before?

Here's how I've come to understand this:

It's been explained to me that the ions didn't have to ""open every channel along the way

It doesn't actually allow Na^+ to diffuse down the axon more quickly. Myelin provides insulation for the neuron preventing K^+ leakage from the axon; this keeps the membrane potential raised as the action potential reaches the next node of Ranvier. This raised potential causes a higher portion of the clustered voltage gated Na^+ to immediately, open eliciting a strong Na^+ influx, strengthening the signal, allowing it to propagate further down the axon

I've hit a bit of a wall here, through my searches online and here, I haven't found quite the answers that I need.  I'd appreciate any input from graduates and people in the know about these things.  
  
I am trying to figure out if my GRE scores/general profile are competitive enough for the top tier schools in Neuroscience.  I'm interested in applying to Berkeley, MIT, and Harvard, along with a host of schools that are local to me as my safety schools.  The thing is, whenever I see a post online with someone asking if their GRE's or GPA is good enough..I don't usually have those lower scores.  I'm not sure if I'm just being neurotic over this or what, but any critiques are welcome.  
  
  
  

**My GRE score (new version
Subject:		(New)	(%)	(Old translation)  
vebral:		162	89	640  
quantitative:	163	88	780  
analytical:	5.5	96	  
  
GPA is a 3.95  
  
B.S. in Computer Science
B.A. in Psychology  
  
  
  

I did a senior thesis (distinction) in both schools where I did my own research with little faculty assistance. I've also been first author in a conference paper in computer science and will hopefully have another paper out in Physics at the end of this year.  
  
The thing is, and my own research in sensory augmentation. That last one is the closest thing I have to neuroscience, and that's more cognitive science than anything else as my device that I created for the research is external/rather simple and relies more on principles I learned in psychology.  
  
  

*The biggest issue:*  
My professor told me that I should retake the GRE

It peaked my interest about the neurophysiological processes mediating addiction specifically delta fos b activity. I was wondering if there are some pivotal review articles dealing with the following:

2. long term porn exposure and its general neuroplastic effects 
3. some sort of comparison dealing with various drugs exposure (particularly dopaminergic) and internet porn exposure.

I'm going to admit ignorance in regards to this field. What little understanding I do have comes from online articles and an innate ability for breaking down complex systems into smaller pieces.

Anyways, it's *way* more complex). Can I get some input on that conclusion, if I'm way off base I'd like to know.

So with my limited understanding, or could we possibly develop an apparatus that the brain could ""learn"" to use, like a new sense? If such an interface was ever developed, could we possibly supplement our natural neural processing with artificial computer processing?

It would be amazing to just ""have"" a calculator built into your brain

I think this field is very exciting and while progress like this is a long ways off

As a network person my day-to-day work in the IT field revolves around allowing computers to talk to each other. In a way I sort of see the internet as another, and evolving system of communication (that's all what it all comes down to right?). Entire communities of people online interact with each other very much like the organic beings that comprise them. Are we possibly developing a worldwide ""superconscious""? Is such a thought even worth entertaining?

And let me ask you this, at least within the context of their own mind? After all, the 9/11 terrorists were completely convinced that they were doing Allah's work. Hitler was completely convinced that he was improving mankind by forming a superior race. I'm not saying that these actions are at all justified, they were horrendous crimes.

There is lots of material about how neurons work

There is lots of material from fMRI scans and the like that says 'This is a region used in decision-making'

But is there a (hypothetical even) model of how the pieces all fit together? Ie - perceptions come in through the senses

Certainly this has been done for perception to model how we perceive objects etc.

But is there a model about how we trade-off short and long-term plans

Projects like Spaun claim that they have (or others claim that Spaun has) created a functioning model of the human brain. But they haven't - it's a model of a tiny part of it. I'm not trying to belittle the achievement

Hence my question - how much does neuroscience actually know? Are there any good books that try to put the whole picture together convincingly?

I’m a screenwriter/filmmaker and am currently writing a screenplay that involves neuroscience. While the movie would be science fiction

The story is about a couple of youngish scientists who invent artificial intelligence in their garage. Basically they invent some sort of scanning technology that they integrate into an electrorheological smart fluid which is then put into the main character’s head. Over the course of a few weeks

My questions are: 

1. Is this in any way a reasonably plausible method for such a task (even if it isn’t realistically possible). 

2. What scanning technology would they have to have to accomplish this? How small would this technology have to be able to scan?
3. What would be the best way to get the fluid into the skull? Right now we have a nasal craniotomy (if that’s a real thing)
4. How much computer memory would be required to store the brain’s information (it mostly copies the neocortex as some of the more body-oriented parts don’t translate)?

Cognitive abilities and disorders unique to humans are thought to result from adaptively driven changes in brain transcriptomes, chimpanzee, and macaque prefrontal cortex the genome-wide distribution of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), an epigenetic mark sharply regulated at TSS, and identified 471 sequences with human-specific enrichment or depletion. Among these were 33 loci selectively methylated in neuronal but not non-neuronal chromatin from children and adults, including TSS at DPP10 (2q14.1), CNTN4 and CHL1 (3p26.3), including elevated nucleotide substitution rates and regulatory motifs absent in other primates (including archaic hominins), in conjunction with a novel cis-bound antisense RNA linked to Polycomb repressor proteins and downregulated DPP10 expression.

I am suffering from homonymous hemianopsia after a bicycle accident last year. My question was, it is really more of an annoyance. It sucks being able to only see half the world you used to see. That, and the fact that I have to pay way more attention to where I'm walking and what I'm doing all the time instead of just leisurely moving about. I got OK'd to drive so this isn't an immediate need. I'm just glad that I don't have ""Visual Neglect"". That would really suck, any help or any direction to new treatments or things that could come about in the near future is much appreciated. The internet hasn't really been much of a help.

2) Consider again, and one child is screaming and crying from the pain. What's going on in the brain? Why would one body (hypothetically) ""feel"" more pain than another when the cause is the same? Would the brain processes be different, one showing ""in more pain"" and one ""in less pain"", or would the processes be the same but perhaps it's relative - let's say the child who says the piercing didn't hurt has broken her leg before, so she is comparing getting her ears pierced to that pain, and relative to a broken leg, getting her ear pierced doesn't hurt?

I read related Wikipedia article and [a thread here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/neuroscience/comments/hy7kt/i_need_some_major_advice_any_neuroscientists_out/)

I kindly request some advices. Here is some explanation of myself.

I will get my bachelor's degrees in **Computer Engineering** and **Mathematics**. I am making double major. I find it fascinating to learn information from human body (or any living creature) and use this information to build a machine or adapt a machine to this idea. This information can be anything such as an estimation of which sample is dense without exact counting etc. These are charming things.

Until now, news etc, and I am thinking of neuroscience. I love Machine learning and I want to do it based-on clinical facts. Thus maybe I make a small contribution to understand the brain a little bit more.


I suppose that my interests come together in *Computational Neuroscience*.

If you still in there

- Is my study area which contains no biological background a problem for neuroscience? I do not think so but I want to be sure. 

- Is it too late to jump into the neuroscience from my area? (same issue). How hard to get biological (and also psychological) background from the zero point? 

- How is the environment? Neuroscientists always study in a research lab? 

- Which countries are good at Neuroscientific study?

I have applied some PhD programs already. For example Hong Kong Polytechnic. My prospective advisor focuses on biometrics and artificial neural networks. Are these far from the neuroscience? For instance

Some quick background; I have about three years left (just transferred to a four-year university from a CC). I started out as a psychology major but discovered around the time that I transferred that I enjoy the sciences and neuroscience in particular. So, chem, physics. Since I work part-time to support myself while in school, it is going to take me about 3 years to make it through all my required classes plus relevant science courses. 

I just completed a summer research program in a neuro lab at one of the UC schools

My question is this: how much undergraduate research experience should I be trying to get? Would it be enough to complete summer research programs instead of volunteering in a lab during the school year (I can get 2 more in before graduation)?

I'm organizing a roundtable discussion on concussion management for my women's hockey team at a Canadian university.  Currently we don't really have any guidelines to follow when a player gets a concussion and I'd like to change that.

I've gotten together a group consisting of: teammates, a neuropsychologist, and the athletic department head.  I'm hosting a roundtable discussion to talk about the program, and I was wondering if I could get a little feedback on my agenda so far.  I have absolutely no experience with anything like this, so any advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

Here's what I've got so far:


Introduction
- My story
- Personal introductions of everyone in attendance.
- Presentation by the doctor
     What is a concussion?
     Why do we need to pay attention to concussions?
     What is a general process that one might follow?

Discussion Questions
-&gt; Is this project warranted for this team?  What about for other teams?
-&gt; What role would each party be willing to take in this initiative?
-&gt; What is the best practice for evaluating an athlete during a game?
-&gt; Who should have the final say on the RTP protocol? (Day-of and long-term)
-&gt; What is the best approach for managing persisting post-concussion symptoms?

Hello

I picked this article essentially because it is a short confirmation for the first in-vivo recordings using optogentics. The PI used a adeno-associated viral vector to insert ChR2 into the cell membrane, but also pulse patterns. It would be very useful to perhaps have a number of ChR2's expressed that are unique to particular stimulus. I see this being beneficial from a molecular computing perspective. In terms of discussion, here are a few questions to ponder:

* What is the future of optogentics now that in-vivo proof-in-concept studies have been completed?
* Is the vector system describe the most efficient way of inducing expression?
* What other application does optogentics allow for(I am interested particularly in creative ways)?
* Anything else you find interesting about this manuscript or method.

What I don't understand (and this is back to the basics of APs) is why this action is necessary.  As I understand the process of an AP:

*  Stimulation occurs
*  The cell is flooded with Na+
*  Shortly after
*  Intracellular charge lowers


Assuming that I have the above down correctly

*  If Na+ rushing into the cell is raising intracellular charge

I have a large number of textbooks available to me through my lab and I find that their materials are either far too technical. I find the theory explained in 'Cellular and Molecular Neurophysiology' to be a great introduction but there is a lot left to be desired...
1) No textbooks really cover field potential recordings. What does it mean to record fEPSPs, why do we use multiple tetani as opposed to one for certain LTP paradigms (I know some of these are empirical, but for PPF, for example, I have not been able to find the reference that first demonstrated that increased presynaptic Ca2+ entry is responsible for this phenomenon, I am just told this by faculty).
2) I haven't found a textbook that discusses simple concepts like why people use certain internal solutions, etc (while I know the answers to several of these examples, I often find they are not from the literature/textbooks but because that is what I was told without any backup. A practice I find common amongst electrophysiologists..., ""I cut the brain this way, and that's why it works.""
3) I also find textbooks lack simple technical explanations for when you're actually getting ready to do hands on work; e.g. Why do we apply a small depolarizing current when attempting to rupture the cell membrane while applying suction? Again

I was asked to read this during a lab rotation for why we use filaments in our glass pipettes and wanted to die: http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Micropipette-Techniques-Cell-Physiology/dp/0471909521. This was WAY too technical

After brain injury, form protective boundaries around the injury keeping the damage in check and making sure it does not spread. In addition to this, these reactive astrocytes also being to dedifferentiate to a nearly progenitor or neural stem cell (NSC) like state (in vivo; in vitro, the cells can be made to completely dedifferentiate into NSCs).

Yet, once the astrocytes have transformed into clusters of NSCs, we can force upregulate over enzymes/substances within them that cause the NSCs to become either GABAminergic or glutaminergic neurons.

Did I understand the science correctly? Are we really this close to being able to make significant strides in healing brain damage/injury patients?

I mean, there's the transition from rats to humans, and the differences there need to be understood as well.

Now, and remain working (without much need for pantaloons).

However, some hardware information maybe? I'm at a loss. 

I'm pretty sure I've ran a trial licence before on this particular hardware configuration (minus my new hd) which is running the current trial

Has anyone found a way around this problem (e.g. found a way to circumvent the trial-renewal block)? Even sharing a hunch would be good at this point. 

I'd not mind spending a small amount on a spare hd to avoid a commute/lack of comfort just this once.

I'm a CS grad student working on a project for real-time systems.  Embedded systems and whatnot, but still.  My group is working on a helmet that has an accelerometer and a wireless transmitter within.  When a person gets hit (such as a football player on the line of scrimmage), it crunches the data from the accelerometer to determine if there was possible concussive injury.  We'd heard of some studies that indicated that minor trauma over a period of time can be just as threatening as a single major trauma, so we also intend to keep a history of impacts with the helmet.  There will be a data API that will allow the coach, fieldside medic, and whoever else needs it to be able to access the data.

Now, what kind of acceleration to be concerned over (simple linear shock, rotational shock, etc.), and really whatever else we can get from this.  Any thoughts?

The Master’s program I’ll be attending in the fall is in philosophy

The biggest problem I foresee is that my double major in two Humanities-based disciplines have left me relatively lacking in any academic coursework in the hard sciences or mathematics. The only science course I’ve taken thus far was an astronomy class I got a ‘C’ in. I’ve never actually taken any calculus classes—I fulfilled the math requirement with a class in Statistics (which I did manage to get an ‘A’ in). 

I’ve been told research experience is highly preferable in neuroscience admissions. I DO have research experience

My undergraduate GPA was very high (3.91) and like I said when I apply for a Ph.D. program in two years I’ll have a Master’s from a Fulbright grant, that the lack of math/hard science in my record will quarantine me from any programs. Since I just graduated, it’s too late for me to take any classes for academic credit. I do have a few months before I leave for grad school. Does anyone have any advice on what I can/should do to make myself more appealing and more prepared for a neuroscience Ph.D program in two years?
