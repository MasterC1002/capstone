==========================================
What this will leave you with in the end
==========================================
1. Official Firmware
2. Official Recovery
3. Binary Counter set to 0
4. Device status to ""Normal""
5. Factory Settings as if you just took it out of the box.

Basically once you do this it will be good enough if you need to return for warranty purposes.

---

**Prerequisites**

* This is only for the Sprint Galaxy S3.
* You *must* be running 100% stock unrooted.
* You need a 32g or smaller SD card. That's because Android Recovery doesn't recognize SDXC cards, does.

**Instructions**

* Download the update [directly from Google's servers](http://android.clients.google.com/packages/ota/sprint_samsung_l710/eec955eb4a5b.update_SPH-L710_LI3_to_LJ7.zip) and put it in the root directory of your SD card.
* Turn the phone off.
* Boot into **stock** recovery by holding down the volume up and home buttons as you turn the phone on.
* Choose to apply an update from external storage
* Wait for it to do its magic.

**That's all there is to it!**

Enjoy

**The easiest way for the S3 I9300 (international Version) and the S3 I9305 (international Version LTE) is to use framaroot.**

You can find the guide here:  
http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2130276

To sum it up

This installs SuperUser and the su binary. That's it

Another way is using the chainfire root method.

http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1695238
 
You'll need [odin](http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1110471&amp;d=1338981159) and the [rootkernel](http://download.chainfire.eu/196/CF-Root/SGS3/CF-Root-SGS3-v6.4.zip)(download button at the very bottom of the page).

Now

Copy pasta from the xda thread:

* Unzip the attached Odin3-vX.X.zip file
* Download and unzip the CF-Root-SGS3-vX.X.zip file (see posts below this one)
* If you end up with a recovery.img and cache.img file
* (USB) Disconnect your phone from your computer
* Start Odin3-vX.X.exe
* Click the PDA button
* Put your phone in download mode (turn off phone, or run adb reboot download command)
* (USB) Connect the phone to your computer
* Make sure Repartition is NOT checked
* Click the Start button
* Wait for Android to boot
* Done!

**Of course, SCH I535 and so on.**

Now

**T999**

basically: [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=QPeIZZVYHbY)

Download [this](http://downloadandroidrom.com/file/GalaxyS3Sprint/rooting/GalaxyS3RootSprint.zip)

Now

Then do this (just like the chainfire method):

* Open Odin3-vX.X.zip file
* If you end up with a recovery.img and cache.img file
* (USB) Disconnect your phone from your computer
* Start Odin3-vX.X.exe
* Click the PDA button
* Put your phone in download mode (turn off phone, or run adb reboot download command)
* (USB) Connect the phone to your computer
* Make sure Repartition is NOT checked
* Click the Start button
* Wait for Android to boot
* Done! We just flashed the cwm recovery (clockworkmod recovery)
* Place the CWM-SuperSU-v0.87.zip in your phone's sdcard (for example the download folder)
* now put your phone in recovery mode (turn off phone
* select install zip from sdcard
* select the folder in which you placed cwm-supersu-v0.87.zip
* select yes
* done!

your t999 is now rooted.

Guides for other versions will follow in the future.

1375198532.0,1jcqe6,Hard brick off a correct ROM flash?,Psychozoa,19,6,19,"Hey /r/GalaxyS3 

First post here. Right off the bat

So at the end of last year one of my best friends picked up a Galaxy S3 after coming from an iPhone 4S and loved it, and game consoles for years so I've been a bit familiar with roots and jailbreaks.

Anyways I'd say 2 months ago he finally wanted to root his phone and had me over so I could make sure he didn't slip up on anything. We did all the correct procedures to root the phone, wiped Cache, wiped Dalvik, and then rebooted. However each time it was locked on the LiquidSmooth boot screen, we noticed however that it wouldn't work 100% until we wiped Data but since then it was fine. After that we flashed GAPPS and it was good to go.

Well this weekend he came by and while at my house wanted to update to the latest version of LiquidSmooth. He looked it up on the same spot he got the original ROM from, loaded them onto the SD card and then booted into Recovery. I mentioned the Data issue to him before and he said ""Well I'll try flashing the ROM alone first, if it locks up again like last time I'll wipe Data.""

So we went into Recovery, Dalvik, and then rebooted. But it suddenly went black and.... That was it. From there we tried out every button combo and it was just a black screen, the closest we got was some miscellaneous plugin that couldn't install when plugged in. I don't remember the name, but when we looked it up it just referred us to the fact that it was a Hard Brick and we couldn't fix it unless we JTAG'd the phone... Which I don't have the hardware for unfortunately.

So my question is: How could this happen? Yes I understand there's ALWAYS a risk in bricking

I had some problems along the way

Now, no more pick-up-phone-on-text-to-call-back, and that's pretty much it for the cons. Due to my own oversight, I didn't back up my apps (specifically for restore, but I still have all of them if I need to go back to stock) which meant I had to download and reinstall all my apps. The Play Store couldn't download and install apps remotely for a little bit, but after a few phone restarts, that resolved itself as well.

As for the pros, but my connection speed increased by around 10 megabits, which was nice. The most important thing, though, was the absolute speed of the thing. Before, whenever I opened an app (Google Voice) for example, there was some really obvious lag and it took forever and the whole situation felt sluggish. Now

Obviously, no contant updating. It's a real thing of beauty.

Hi guys

Been lurking here for a while now and thought I'd share my experiences with this particular ROM. I've been using Android for a few years now and am an avid follower. I always try to keep my devices up to date with the latest ROMs (I have a Xoom and an i747 S3). I've rooted and installed ROMs on my friends' phones as well. 

I was using stock TW for a while running the K747 Kernel, my battery life has been AMAZING. On TW I could get anywhere between 18-30 hours on a single charge depending on how much I use it. The only catch was I could only get a couple hours of screen time, maybe close to 3 hours if I started using the phone a lot on a full charge. With Task650's AOKP ROM, I have been getting 24-36 (or even more, haven't experimented) hours on Battery with 3-4 (or more) hours of screen time! Right now I'm 21 hours in with 3 hours of screen time clocked and I still have 35% battery remaining! This ROM is a beast and I highly recommend it to anyone with an AT&amp;T S3 who wants the most out of their device.",,False,t5_2u1ok,True

**Touchwiz:** The stock OS that comes with the phone. 

* Pros: Very well integrated into abilities of the phone. Inspired by nature, and on the homescreen, the time and weather widget is very eye-appealing. The camera is great! If you can't live without all the fancy features on the camera, switching away from this ROM might be a deal breaker for you.

* Cons: Lag. Bloat. Stuff you don't need, its android, so you can do a lot with it, but I feel like Touchwiz is treating me like a baby. Everytime I set a new default action, it tells me where I can reset the default actions. I can't use developer options. I just feel like Touchwiz is my mother, telling me I can do anything, while hiding half of the stuff I don't know about.


**CM10:**

* Pros: HOLY GOOGLE, damn fast. I feel like this is what Google meant for Android to be. I love the blue overall theme of it. Everything is uniform, and customizable beyond belief. You just have to search for what you want. I feel like I'm missing so much, because I could go on for days about the endless possiblities of CM10. No matter what anyone says, it is worth trying for atleast a week. If you don't atleast like it, I'll send you a 5 paragraph essay with my apologies.

* Cons: The camera is pretty simple. Panorama is your only ""extra"" feature, but I had one bug that made the home button unresponsive about half the time when trying to wake the screen. Then, I switched to a nightly, and hallelujah. Also, people complain about data drops. I haven't noticed them very often, they don't really bug me.

**BONUS: CM10.1:**

* Pros: Camera upgrades, and the new Chronus widget is damn beautiful. Best clock widget I've seen.

* Cons: You need to see which nightly works for you. The latest nightly I tried was very buggy. Tried the nightly from a few days before

If you are root you can use links2sd. Plug your SD card directly into your computer

Put all your backed up storage back on the fat32 portion of the sdcard (this will all that will be visible to windows). Put the sdcard back in your phone. Your phone OS will only recognize the fat32 portion of the sdcard at first

 If you have formatted everything correctly it will link the application to your sdcard ext4. Then you can select all and under actions select link to sd. It will then move all the information done to ext4 of your sd card. 

You can also click menu

In links2sd you can menu --&gt; storage info and you will now see extsdcard AND SD Card 2nd Part (this is your app storage). the extsdcard is your fat32 which is where I store all my music/video/movies etc.This keeps your internal sdcard with tons of space.

I found that if you open the USB PC connection settings in the phone and check the box [Camera (PTP)](http://i.imgur.com/GivxE.png) my [computer](http://i.imgur.com/iebyS.png) will read the memory.

I'm on an AOSP/CM based rom at the moment and when I open the camera it throws an error that reads ""Cannot connect to camera"" and closes

After doing a lot of searching I read that this error has to do with the camera firmware and I stumbled on this thread on the T-MO SGS3 forum on  XDA - http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2102981

    -So basically they're saying to paste these .bin files in /data/ 
    and set permissions to 777... this had no effect.

This then lead me to this thread on the international SGS3 XDA forum - http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2113526&amp;page=4

    These guys say to revert to stock (or a stock based rom)
    your phone app and type *#34971539# to access the 
    CameraFirmware Update window. Great.  Well
    screen turns black and the title reads  ""CameraFirmware Update""
    but then it exits and I get a pop up ""Factory Test has closed"".. 

    Prior to this point I have ODIN'd back to stock rooted FW and nothing. 
    I figured it may have been a bad firmware download
    again from another source..same FC.. I try stock rooted.. same FC.. 
    I flash a TW rom

None of the stock roms will load that damn CameraFirmware screen and this isn't built into CM/AOSP roms. After reading thru the international thread

So now I'm completely stumped..I found a way to update the firmware

There seems to be many ways to Flash the phone Odin, mobile odin. There also seems to be a few ways to root the phone as well.



First off to clarify....""flashing"" is essentially like installing right? I would think that you require to flash roms



What about rooting? i thought rooting was something else (like entering a passcode to get admin access


http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1739426


It seems like they are flashing to root. Is flashing to root or injecting the root the normal rooting procedure? 
If this is considered as normal


It seems to me that CWM has multi uses


Is Odin


Is the no counter trip rooting method good for my Canadian S3 on Rogers I747 model? 


I've also noticed the flash tripping method combined with Triangle away to reset flash count. 


Then theres this Rogers ROOT page (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1822308). 


and this INTRODUCING THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 TOOLKIT [SNAPDRAGON EDITION] 

http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1746665


how does these differ with each other?

- S3 toolkit

- Rogers method

- root with no counter trip

- root with counter trip

- any other root methods?


Which one is recommended?

My ringtones (incoming call &amp;amp; text/notification) have stopped working. The volume is all the way up in regular rocker bar and in settings. A few pages into my Google search and nothing has helped. I've seen people with the same problem the fix is usually make sure its on in the notification drawer (check); use a 3rd party ringtone program (check using zedge already); and then for the rooters clear cache / dalvik and fix permissions (both check). This has been going on for about two weeks. I have been running liquidsmooth v2.7 for around a month. The tones all worked fine until two weeks ago. I've done all the searches and attempted fixes. I would usually say it had to be the ROM but they worked with the same ROM before. I updated to the newer v2.9 on Thursday and still no help. 

I've also tried reboot and power off/ battery pull.

I took the advice off Reddit of getting it replaced or repaired. Since I had the phone after 28 days I have to get it repaired. From the store I bought it from It was then sent to Samsung's repair centre.

Six days later

&gt; ""Sir

Because the phone **""has had liquid damage""** this means my warranty is void and therefore I will have to pay for the repair estimated at a staggering £130/ €153/ $204!

I couldn't believe what I was hearing! I've had the S3 for precisely 41 days until I turned the phone in for repair. Along with it I bought a screen protector and a strong case cover too. Within that time I've carried it around like it was my baby and never had any accident with any liquid.

[The PBA board as you know is the main motherboard of the S3.] (http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w122/omygodisitme/repair10_zps0188b085.png)To my knowledge the PBA board is not the problem here. [It's the audio socket that needs replacement.](http://i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/660109026_2/wholesale-free-shipping-White-Audio-Jack-Buzzer-Ringer-Loud-Sound-Speaker-For-Samsung-Galaxy-S3-i9300.jpg)

The report given to the repair centre by my phones retailer was: 
&gt;""Poor Audio""

On their part that was incredibly brief to what I've said.

If I'm not mistaken I believe the engineer has overlooked my phone and marked my S3 as liquid damage after *supposedly* seeing the liquid sensor has been tripped and then concluded that the most expensive part of the phone needs replacement.
