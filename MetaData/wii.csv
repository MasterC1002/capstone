I've been debating if the laptop + Dolphin alone is good enough. A couple good games don't work with Dolphin (CSI: Deadly is one). The Wii is a pretty small console to take in checked baggage

Anyway

XPal/Energizer XP8000 I carry for phone charging has a 12volt output option. So I cabled it up. Works great! It is max rated at 3AMP output

I tested for 30 minutes with a USB portable hard drive running off the Wii... seems great so far! I also had the WiFi on at the same time... and played some very heavy-load games.

So now I can just inline the XPal charger brick to Wii and not have to carry another power brick.

What an awesome investment. I really didn't know what to expect. I played Mario Kart Double Dash for maybe an hour on GameCube back in the day and it just wasn't as good as Mario Kart 64. But woah. Mario Kart Wii just makes me feel like I'm 9 again playing N64 and eating crappy Ellios pizza with my best friends!  I'm 23 now and to get that kind of kick out of a game like that means a lot to me.

**Disclaimer**

Modding your Wii can be dangerous. I, read and follow [mauifrog’s guide on brick prevention](http://www.wiihacks.com/recommended-faqs-guides-tutorials-only/44104-brick-prevention-things-you-should-never-do.html) found on Wiihacks. Finally, the moderators at r/wii do not condone or promote piracy. Do not ask for links to pirated material. 


**Benefits**

That said, and most importantly, have the ability to back up your own Wii games to play off of an external hard drive. 


**Modding**

I am no expert, [**Wiibrew**](http://wiibrew.org), [**CompleteSoftmodGuide**](http://sites.google.com/site/completesg/) and [**GBAtemp**](http://wiki.gbatemp.net) are excellent resources for information regarding this material. My guide is just a collection of links accumulated over time.

For further information on what homebrew and Wii hacking and modding is, and works regardless of system menu version. These two methods will allow you to actually start using homebrew stuff.

It is essential to have brick deterrents as stated in mauifrog's guide. After following the above guides, by holding the reset button while turning on the Wii, and that you can access BootMii from Priiloader. Also make sure to create a NAND (Wii system memory) backup in BootMii, as this will be a copy of you Wii and can be used to recover from certain bricks. 

The next step is to upgrade all your cIOS and IOS's, NAND emulators, GameCube loaders, and much more. To update all your cIOS/IOS's, simply install SysCheck to your SD Card from [Wiibrew](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/SysCheckGX), run the check, and take the output file SysCheck provides and run it with ModMii. ModMii will download all necessary files and generate a guide for you to follow to bring your Wii up to date.

Once this is completed

* **SNES GX** - Super Nintendo Emulator
* **FCE Ultra GX** - NES Emulator
* **Genesis Plus** - Sega Genesis Emulator
* **Visual Boy Advance** - Gameboy/Gameboy Advance Emulator
* **WiiMC** - Media center for DVD's
* **Super Mario War Wii** - Battle game with Nintendo characters
* **Quake Wii** - Original Quake using the Wii Zapper

Some homebrew requires manual download and installation, and mods of emulators and games. First are cover mods. The very kind Wiimpathy has modded FCE Ultra GX, SNES GX, and Visual Boy Advance to allow for [coverflow style menus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=pKbpBjKVWjY). Although these versions of emulators are not officially supported by the original emulator coders, they may be preferred to because of their aesthetics. Both of these cover mods can be found [at GBAtemp](http://gbatemp.net/topic/303645-snes9xgx-cover-co/). Mastershoes has kindly compiled NES, Gameboy/Gameboy Advance, and SNES covers

Game modders have changed Super Smash Bros Brawl to their liking, can be found at [Smashmods](http://www.smashmods.com/). Other game modders have created entire levels and worlds in New Super Mario Bros Wii. Mods such as [Another Super Mario Bros Wii](http://www.wiihacks.com/wii-games/75382-another-super-mario-bros-wii-released.html) and the [Newer Super Mario Bros Wii Holiday Special](http://rvlution.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=891) show the dedication of the modding community. 

There are also a myriad of homebrew games and applications that you can download and install straight to your Wii using the H[omebrew Browser](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_Browser). The most popular applications can be seen at [CodeMii](http://www.codemii.com/hbbstats.php)

The best perk by far of modding your Wii is to play Wii games off a USB external hard drive. Compatible hard drives for the Wii can be found at [GBAtemp](http://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/USB_Devices_Compatibility_List). There are several USB loader programs available. A table comparing the perks of the different USB loaders can be found on [GBAtemp](http://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/USB_Loader_Releases). A popular USB loader is [Wiiflow](http://www.wiiflowiki.com/Wiiflow/), WBFS, and FAT32. All file systems work, but the most recommended is FAT32 for its ability to be read by computer and its compatibility with Homebrew applications.

This allows you to run homebrew on a **completely unmodded Wii**. Simply prepare an SD card and then use any existing exploit (such as Bannerbomb or Letterbomb) to launch Casper as and when you want it.

By using Casper to launch [NEEK](http://code.google.com/p/custom-di/downloads/list) you can just insert a pre-prepared SD card and connect up a USB drive to **any Wii** and launch your exploit of choice to boot into a completely emulated Wii environment with full access to homebrew and backup launching. Handy if you just want to pop around to a friend's place with all your game backups. Or simply to show how awesome a modded Wii is to those who haven't yet taken the plunge.

As usual XFlak's [ModMii](http://gbatemp.net/t207126-modmii-for-windows) is bang up-to-date and will download Casper for you - simply use it's new 'Abstinence Wizard'.

You can use the normal [d2x installer](http://code.google.com/p/d2x-cios-installer/) with the new [v7 modules](http://code.google.com/p/d2x-cios/)

Below is the v7 changelog (direct copy-paste):


[ d2x v7 ]

- Refactored all modules and plugins in order to achieve code reuse through
  a new common library.
- Updated ciosmaps.xml to include the IRQ4 patch required by the new
  experimental EHCI module (not released yet).  
- Used a more proper offset to detect DL games like Sakura Wars.
- Disabled nand emulation before returning to system menu or channel.
- Improved error 002 fix after ios reload block. Now Wii Fit Plus channel
  installation works properly.
- Fixed missing identification and patch for base IOS60-v6174 in ES plugin.
- Added auto detection of the first FAT partition on the device when nand
  emulation is activated without specifying any partition.
- FAT Module moved a bit forward in memory in order to create the space
  required by the new experimental EHCI module (not released yet).
- Fixed a bug when closing FAT module.
- Fixed an alignement issue on file renaming in FFS plugin.
- Removed support for base IOSs with old version like IOS38 v3610.
- Added ios reload block capability for nand emulation.
- Removed FAT ISO loading support from DIP plugin (never used by any loader
  and completely useless now thanks to fraglist capability added in v6).
- Fixed a memory alignement issue that could break ios reload block.
- Added bidirectional escape for invalid FAT characters in nand emulation.
- Now FAT_GetUsage returns fake values for WiiWare/VirtualConsole and real 
  values taken from FAT for disc-based Wii games. This workaround has proven 
  to improve nand emulation compatibility. 
- Added a thread to make the drive led blink when writing to FAT.
- Added nand emulation mode rev17-like (experimental).
- Fixed COD MW3 online update on full nand emulation. More generally this fix
  should improve compatibility with DLC installation on emulated nand also for
  games like COD Black Ops
- Now the tree /import is emulated in partial mode too. This way COD MW3 online
  update and DLC installation work properly in partial emulation.
- Added a hack that allows No More Heroes 2 to create the save file in nand
  emulation mode (tnx to Sneek source).
- Minor changes and code clean up.

Enjoy!

**Can or how can the Nintendo Wii Fit be used to improve the balance of elderly people?**


Basically, I've come up with a questionnaire to try and find out what people find most helpful and enjoyable about the Wii Fit. If some of you could fill in the survey that would be awesome, if you have any elderly relatives which use the Wii Fit it would be absolutely spectacular if you could forward on the link. 

There's nothing you need to sign up for and there's only a few questions!

---------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: After much troubleshooting, but if I use my router (say, watching Netflix on my PC) then the flickering starts right up. I tried switching WiFi channels, and even tried another router, but had the same issue. (This other router had the option of using the 5GHz band rather than the usual 2.4Ghz band - switching to 5GHz solved the flickering, but it's not compatible with all my electronics.) The Wii is currently being shipped in to Nintendo, who claims that this is the first time they've ever seen this problem.
---------------------------------------------------------------

I've had my wii for about four months, the wiimote cursor flickers randomly, either appearing and disappearing (SMG2) or flickering to the edge of the screen and back. This doesn't happen all the time, but when it's happening the wii is basically unusable (it seems to be increasing in frequency over the last couple weeks, so it now happens daily).


Things I've tentatively ruled out:

-Wiimote issues - when the problem is happening

-IR interference issues - looking at the Sensitivity screen

-Game disk issues - this happens in multiple games


So, which is intermittently losing connection with the remotes. If so, would it be easier for me to just replace this module? I'm reasonably electronically savvy (got my undergrad degree in EE) and the modules are only a few dollars, so if this is definitely the problem then replacing it myself might be easiest.

I've inquired with Nintendo in the past about repairing my Wii.  They told me it would cost between 90 and 100 dollars and if they can't repair it they said they'd give me a new Wii and refund all my VC points which would let me redownload all my VC games.

2D Platformer: Kirby's Epic Yarn. I found Kirby much more charming and lighthearted than New Super Mario Bros. The cute factor won me over + I'm a huge Kirby fan.

3D Platformer:  The only one I own is Super Mario Galaxy so that's my choice.

Action/Adventure: Metroid Other M.  It's not really as bad as other people say it is and I'm glad Team Ninja took a step away from the FPS aspect.  I recently ordered Skyward Sword however so this will probably change.

Action RPG: Rune Factory Frontier. I have yet to try my other action rpg

FPS: Goldeneye 007.  Unfortunately

Hack N Slash: Sengoku Basara 3.  I love Dynasty Warriors style games and Sengoku Basara is even more over the top and ridiculous.

Beat em up: No more Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle.  Very fun game and satisfying to kill the enemies.  I get a bit bored of minigames though.

Fighting: Smash Bros. Brawl.  Honestly, Brawl undoubtedly is my favorite in the fighting genre.  Tons of characters (I'm a nintendo fan.  This doubles the appeal), endless fun with friends, etc.

Light Gun: House of the Dead Overkill.  Zombies with an 80s feel to it?  Sounds like one hell of a ride.  I was playing this with my little cousins one day.  The black guy's dialogue made things a little awkward

HBC was auto-updated to 1.0.8 during these times.

Recently decided to try out USB Loader GX (because it's convenient).  I ran it via HBC

My problem was I couldn't run some backups

I did an official update, however USB Loader GX wasn't working correctly.  It would come up, display the backups, but when attemping to play it would bring me back to HBC.

I learned the official update overwrites/removes Bootmii and thought that was the problem

I googled ""4.3U USBLoader GX"" and it got me to a guide

Used something called ""IOS236 Installer/ Uninstaller"" and picked the option ""Getting IOS36 revision 3351"" to install.

Then

Then

All the above from IOS file(s) that were on the SD card

Using the above, but those few backups still didn't work.

Here is what I understood so far from several sources ([Guide 1](http://www.wiihacks.com/recommended-faqs-guides-tutorials-only/60921-guide-softmod-any-wii.html) and [Guide 2](http://www.wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_setup)) and some questions to make it more clear for me.

* Use an exploit from an original game in order to run Hackmii Installer.
* Install HBC in order to be able to install homebrew applications.
* Install BootMii (What exactly does it do?)

At this point is my Wii considered softmodded? Can I play games from a harddisk with USB Loader?
Chapter 2 from the first link(Guide 1) also suggests installing a modpack
What exactly are those?
Are they needed?
If not what are the advantages of having them?

I laughed at the ridiculousness at some parts, and the game didn't feel too limited by the Wii's hardware, but I was a bit sad that not all the characters could be played.  It played great with CCP or Wiimote and was good for hours of fun.

The Bad: I'll be honest guys.  I did not like Mario Galaxy, I am not a fan of motion controls, and found them annoying to use in said games.  Finally, Xenoblade's gameplay was boring to me.  I followed Operation Rainfall and made a post about it at one point to help garner attention for Pandora and Last Story, and the day I got Xenoblade, I immediately popped it in and started playing.

- supports the direct launching of games in the WBFS format instead of the FST (Disc-Ex rips) format. Yay!!

If you set up a NEEK2O environment then I also recommend switching from the normal system menu (and ugly NEEK overlay menu) to [postloader3](http://gbatemp.net/topic/299384-postloader2/) (by stfour). You can set it to autoboot via priiloader in NEEK NAND so you need never see the stock system menu. This will give you a single launcher to kick off all your wiiware/VC (pretty much perfect compatibility), filtering of the displayed titles by VC system type etc.

[ModMii 4.7.6](http://gbatemp.net/t207126-modmii-for-windows) includes the NEEK2O mods when building SNEEK/UNEEK environments for those that don't want to use SNEEK Installer. PL3 is a simple download to SD card.


Finally, USB Loader GX) now support the use of an emulated NAND for saved games and DLC (under d2x v7 betas).

I was then surprised to see that there was very little in the way of post game content either. Challenge Mode is a bit of a misnomer considering it's just a score challenge replay of the game

It feels like this game was pinched in development. I was sure that there was going to be find all the sheriff stars/tokens type achievements and there's a few things in the game that feel like they we're going to be more substantial. The keycard thing you use to open doors seems like it was meant to be more than just a door key and on the third level (I think) you can hear crying from a well and whispers behind doors of the supposedly wiped out village. Thought that this might be mentioned in the ""story"" but nothing comes to pass.

Anybody know if this game was seriously scaled back? I found some stuff about Ubi scaling back the challenge mode but nothing else about a protracted or curtailed development. 

I for one am quite chuffed that the game is cut and dry done after the initial credits- I'm a sucker for extra content and feel compelled to 100% a game it nice but rare to just be done done with a game.

I regrettably bought the Nyko charge base ([here's a link to one](http://www.wiishopexpress.com/Wii-Quad-Charge-Station-charges-4-remotes-p/WA87060.htm?gclid=CKOQ1az0w7gCFVNo7AodmQsAaQ])). I have two problems with this charging station.

1. In order to place my controllers to charge
1. The controllers even without the sleeve don't fit properly and I have to eventually swap the controllers to charge which defeats the purpose of having 4 slots. I think they don't fit because of the wrist strap that connects the controllers at the bottom.

Anyway

I don't care if the base isn't big enough for 4 controllers. I also don't care if the remotes are stored away nice and neatly because I have a basket already filled with all of my Wii U accessories that works nicely. I'm just looking for an efficient way to charge my Wii remotes.

1374420352.0,1ir4fz,Not reading games?,threethirds,5,4,1,"Not too long ago I went to play  Golden Eye which had been sitting in my Wii for a couple weeks since the last time I'd played it.  One of my favorite things about the Wii is being able to download oldschool games and play Netflix and that's what I'd been using it as during that time.  
When I went to click on the disc-drive icon, when I try to insert *any* CD, it recognizes something's been put in but has trouble catching it and pulling it the rest of the way in.  Pushing it in the rest of the way is easy and, the first couple times, worked and it was readable.  

Recently, it still recognizes a CD is in there, and it still tries to eject (and all the DLC still works as does internet and Netflix) but it consistently states the CD/game is unreadable, this goes for any game inserted (the CDs themselves are clean/no scratches.  The Wii itself has suffered no blows or drops :/

I saw a couple videos and How-To's online to fix this sort of issue and just ordered a triangluar screwdriver to attempt to fix this.  I just ordered a PS3 as well so if the Wii craps out, Smash Brothers, the Mario's and Mario Kart, and ChronoTrigger, so *those* would sadly be lost if the thing breaks further but I thought I'd post here to see if anyone's experienced anything similar or had any ideas or tips to rectifying this problem

Thanks in advance!

TL;DR  Wii stopped pulling in/ejecting CDs and says they're unreadable.  Will attempt surgery once scalpel arrives; halp?

Using Darwiin to get sixtyforce to work is all one big headache for me, and Id rather not deal with it.  I guess what Im wondering is there any other emulator on the homebrew channel that will run the game OR how do I get a patched wad to play.  can you patch a wad???  if so can someone steer me in the right direction because that would be my preferred method; running it from a wad on the wii.

A few years ago

Anyway, it won't let me run it on the bad wii without it updating to a newer version.  So, I can't get my data off of it.. especially game saves like for Monster Hunter Tri that you can't copy no matter what.

I have tried using wireless and wired connections to update the Wii.  I have tried using different networks.  I have taken it to other houses and to work to try those networks.  It won't update and it sticks in the same spot every time.  I have tried many times over several years to update it

I even let it sit for over a week and it didn't complete the update or get any errors.

The hard drive is not full.

Everything else functioned fine on the wii until just recently where now I have to turn it off and then back on anywhere from 3 to 20 times before anything other than a black screen comes up.

Since I've owned it


I'm about to just give up and ship it to Nintendo

Googling has not yielded anything useful for me.  I'm hoping someone else here can help me.
