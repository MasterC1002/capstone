1341170018.0,vw0fy,The Longest Week,LAC1987,105,12,83,"Note:  I'm posting this here due to the sheer amount of comments I've received from people over the past few days saying I should put the story where they can find it.  The first part was written in response to an AskReddit post

The AskReddit question was ""You wake up one morning and everyone on earth is gone. Nothing on the TV or the radio and the internet is out. You become convinced that there is no one left on earth. What do you do for your first week as being the only person on earth?""  Link is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vqrfk/you_wake_up_one_morning_and_everyone_on_earth_is/

The Longest Week (Part One)

Day One

Think of all the people I'll never fuck. Think of all the people who will never fuck me over. Read. Drink. Read some more. Think about the fact that there are no other people to write new books, realizing alcohol is now free. Put the bottle in the blue bin. Consider how pointless said blue bin is. Open window, look around, throw empty bottle at...something. Close window. Open window. Unlock all doors. Open all doors. Think about animals, people going from there to not-there, and how, even in an empty room, or seeing something. Decide against looking out window. Pull out fine china and cups and stack them in front of all entrances. Think about how ridiculous my house now looks with furniture blocking the doors and dishes everywhere. Carry pillows and blankets upstairs

Day Two

Wake up.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Longest Week (Part Two)

Day Two

Wake up.  Open eyes.  See...nothing.  Panic.  Open closet door.  Breathe.  Try to remember turning off electric lantern.  Pick up lantern.  Notice switch is set to ""On"".  Think about how few batteries are left, and think about how long I might be able to make this food last.  Feel the familiar pain of hunger.  Ignore it.  Read. 

Empty out drawers looking for batteries.  Rummage through *junk* looking for something useful.  Think about how much trash a person accumulates while they live, and books.  Realize I never looked in the nightstand.  Go upstairs and look in the nightstand.  Find new batteries.  Rip them out of the packaging.  Put them in the lantern.  Notice the lantern still doesn't work.  Make sure I put them in the right way.  Still nothing.  Curse.  Look out the window and try to determine how much light I have left. Notice as clouds block the sun and the light turns weak and sickly.  Think about how dark the world gets without electric light.  No street lights, no headlights, no dim glow of television sets through windows.  Think about being all alone in that darkness.  Look at my neighbor's house.  Gather up all the odds and ends I've set aside in a bag.  Put the remainder of my food in that bag.  Carefully move the china and furniture away from the front door.  Unlock the front door.  Reach for the doorknob.  Hesitate.  Lock the front door.  Sit on the floor and think.  

Leave the bag on the floor.  Get another bag and go around the house collecting the bottles that aren't empty.  Set that bag next to the first one.  Stare at the door.  Think of all the empty houses, carefully, and look at her.  Remember.  Remember.  Put the pictures in my pocket, walk downstairs, and pick up the bags.  Look around at my house and notice how little it looks like a home.  Unlock the front door.  Put my hand on the doorknob, feeling the cool metal.  Think about miles and miles and miles of emptiness.  Turn the knob a fraction of an inch.  Realize I'm sweating.  Realize my hand is shaking.  Take a deep breath.  Let out a short scream as THUNDER CRASHES and the house shakes.  Breathe.  Listen to the first drops of rain turn into a downpour that drowns out the silence.  Smile.  Open the door.

When you hear something like that

Well

I met an old man dying on a train. He didn’t say much of anything when I sat down across from him. Maybe he made an odd noise that old people are prone to make

The room was hot and stuffy - and normally I’m alright with a little bit of heat and humidity - but for once - I noticed.

I noticed the way his breathing was labored, wrinkly, blotched skin. 

I noticed when he closed his eyes, silently judging my existence as a matter of my condition. 

The train came to a screeching halt.  I would say I smelled burning rubber - but that’s impossible because trains don’t work like that.  I smelled my own mortality

That's how we got to talking. We talked about where we were, and the weather, then exchanged tiny best-of's we'd gathered from our lives. Best jokes heard, best one-liners, best pranks. Best tricks, best stories. We shared and drank some more, and we never asked the other his name. We didn't talk about what we did, and in a way it was tiring. It was also a release. Hours later, said ""No need for names."" We'd gotten into sync with one another. Hours of intense conversation will do that. Then he stretched, ""You know something?

The rest of the night was a blur of love. Hours dripped into hours. At some point the alcohol and strawberries took their toll. She didn't visit my dreams that night and when I awoke to the light of the morning she was gone. The knot in my chest unwound and sunk back into its bottomless void. I poured myself a glass of whiskey and stared out at the blindingly bright sun. Though it stung

I finished my drink and grabbed my car keys. For once I actually had a destination in mind. The drive was uneventful. The sun hid behind a shield of clouds and did not return for the rest of the day. On the way there I stopped at a farmer's market and picked up a bouquet of forget-me-nots. They had been her favorite flowers.

I don’t have much time left. How old am I, I’ve had a good time. Sure I’ve had some ups and downs, I got lost somewhere along the way, but I like to think that in the end, I found my path. I found my so called, “calling”. Since I was born, I always thought I could make a difference, make it a better place. Injustice, who thought he knew so much about the world. Yet he knew nothing at all. Or maybe he did. Who knows. Only *God* can tell.

Now I’m sitting here on this lonely bench, I never realized how pretty this lake was. It’s *so*… peaceful; so goddamn, numbingly peaceful. The surface of the water is flat, no ripples, no waves, no movement whatsoever. It’s like time just stopped for the lake. It doesn’t care that the world, well, is about to end. Hell
There’s a little duckling just a few meters away from me. A small, eating it up so neatly, so that not even the Gods can witness the catastrophe. At the center of it, a blinding light is exponentially expanding outwards, eager to consume everything it finds in its path. A fire is raging towards me, towards my town, towards the world. Yet, there’s a cute, not you

Nature blessed our planet and cherished it and nourished it and gave it life. We were the ultimate byproducts of this mind-blowingly long process. But we decided to fuck it all up and just spit in nature’s face. Hey, but then again, who else could’ve caused this? Aliens? Global warming? Let’s be rational. We’re a wild bunch, and I think we all knew this was bound to happen one day. We hoped it wouldn’t happen in our lifetime. Hell, I hoped it wouldn’t happen in *my* lifetime. But I digress.

I don’t have much time left. I’m just glad I’m sitting here on my lonely bench, or hell, why not in a bungalow in Polynesia? If I could’ve lived up to 100 years, probably consumed by senile dementia or Alzheimer’s, I still would’ve been pretty happy. Especially satisfied by the fact that I had lived a freakin century. Oh well. I can see the shockwave dangerously approaching me. The lake isn’t so calm anymore. It’s rising like a King Cobra, hypnotized by a snake enchanter. I can’t see the mushroom anymore, as a wall of water is racing towards me
 
Might as well have a last cigarette. I don’t think I’ll be needing my lungs in hell anyways.

There was a young monster named Davi.  Davi was a lonely boy.  He had seven brothers

Davi cried everyday.  He wanted to make friends.

Davi went to talk to his grandfather

Davi asked his grandfather

Grandfather said ""No

But Davi went ""Nobody in Monster World likes me anyway.  I want to at least try making friends in Human World!""

Grandfather decided to allow Davi three days in Human World
 
Davi thanked his grandfather
  
Davi walked through the dark...

Davi landed on the street.  He was amazed at the sun, and the houses!

Davi saw a college dormitory in which college girls were petting a cat.

Davi sneaked into the dormitory and talked to the cat. ""Mr!"" said Davi.  ""How can I make friends with humans?""

"" Meow! "" answered Mr. Cat.  ""I am not going to tell you because you are a Monster.  We don't like monsters.  But I see you have three gold coins in your pocket.  If you give me one coin
  
Davi gave him one gold coin.  Then Mr. Cat went ""Ok!  All I do is mew and purr at people's feet.""
 
Davi said ""Thank you
 
Davi approached the college girls, and...
  
""AAARRRGGGHHH!!!  Monster!!!""  The college girls screamed in horror
 
Davi was left alone in the dormitory.  He walked out on the street

On the second day

Davi sneaked into the house

"" Arf!"" answers Mr. Dog.  ""I am not going to tell you because you are a monster.  We don't like monsters.  But I see you have two gold coins in your pocket.  If you give me one coin

So Davi gave him one coin.  Then Mr. Dog went ""Okay!  All I do is bow-wow

Davi approached the two young boys

""AAARRRGGGHHH!!! MONSTER!!""  cried the two young boys.  They screamed in horror and ran out of the building!
 
Davi was left alone in the house.  He walked out on the street
  
On the third day

Davi sneaked into the house

""Chirp!"" answered Mrs. Bird.  ""I am not going to tell you because you are a Monster.  We don't like Monsters.  But I see you have one gold coin in your pocket.  If you give me the coin

So Davi gave her his last gold coin.  Then Mrs. Bird says ""Okay!  All I do is chirp and sing a song!""

Davi started singing a song.  Then...
 
""Where does this come from?"" the old blind lady approached Davi.  Davi was so happy.  ""This is the most beautiful song I have ever heard

Then she touched Davi's face.  ""Who are you? What is this?  Could this be a... AAARRRGGGHHH!!! Monster!!!!""  The Old Blind Lady screamed in horror

Davi was left alone once again.  He walked out on the street

Davi went back to the gate.  He was very sad.  The trees

Davi met his grandfather at the gate.  Grandfather went ""Why are you crying?""  Then Davi answered ""I tried really hard to make friends with humans, and I followed their good advice, but nobody liked
 me.  Nobody cared about me anywhere.  I'll be alone for the rest of my life.  Nobody likes me!""
 
Then grandfather answered ""It takes so much courage just to go to Human World.  And you were on your own Davi.  You are the most courageous Monster I have ever seen.  Everytime you cried

Davi listened to his grandfather.  ""Now go home

Davi walked back to his house

Davi's seven brothers rushed to him
  
Davi finally smiled.  From that day on

“Are they big?” I asked him.

“The biggest.” he responded.

“And the nipples?”

“Exquisite.”

This was not going to be easy. We were locked in a mental chess match and it was clear the man was practiced. He was proud of his pig's tits and if they were anything like how he described

“Listen Mister, but I should be going.” 

He looked at me with vacant eyes, and unleashed his secret weapon.

“I'll. let. you. milk. them.” He said slowly

He can't be serious, staring at me in anticipation, panting silently, eyes wet with excitement. And I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little excited too. These weren't just any ordinary tits, they were milkin' tits. The kind of tits you only hear about in stories.

As I wondered if he'd let me taste the milk

“It's time to go Billy

“But Ms. Palanski

“What farmer?”

I turned back only to see an empty field. The farmer had vanished.

This year was unseasonably warm but the flowers didn't seem to mind.  If they were asked they would say they really enjoyed the warm weather

Batman simply stared out the window in a typical Batman-grimace way as he was unable to appreciate the pansies.  He was actually upset the lawn hadn't been mowed.  The pansies didn't mind.  The chair probably didn't mind either since it was just a chair and not pansies or Batman or any kind of flower at all.

Ring items up. Put them in a bag. When it's time to go home you turn off the lights and lock up the store. It's not much but it's a job.
	

You're not quite an adult, but you don't pay bills. You're really only working at this place so you can afford to have fun when you go back to school. You have about an hour left on your shift, and you're spending it watching soap operas you can't understand and eating candy bars you haven't paid for. That's when he walks in the door.
	

This is the guy that made your childhood a living hell. He's not quite an adult, but you've heard some things. You know he got married out of high school, and was divorced soon after. You know he has a kid that he struggles to support. And just looking at him you know you're far better off than him. Finally.
	

You see this guy in front of you. The reason why you chose to walk three miles to school instead of take the bus. The reason why you faked sick so many days back in middle school
	

Which isn't too far off.
	

This man that made you kneel in dog shit in elementary school. This guy who used to take your lunch money. This guy who would make fun of you until you cried is walking up in down the aisles of the store. He makes his way to the alcohol section and starts combing over the different selection of beers. 
	

He's taking a while so you let your mind wander for a bit. You think of those women in those soap operas you can't understand. How you wouldn't mind having women like *that* at your school. You think about what it would be like to act on one of those shows. You think about how you used to love acting in school plays when you were younger until this homeless looking guy looking for beer in your store harassed you about it. How he'd call you a faggot or queer. How he caused you to have such bad anxiety when you tried to act that you simply couldn't do it anymore. You think of nervous you felt when he was around that he caused you to stutter. Which of course only led to more insults. 
	

This guy who used to beat the shit out of you anytime he could. This guy who told all your friends that they were losers for hanging out with you finally chooses his beer and brings it to your cash register. And of course it's one of those bad beers. Six beers for six dollars. And of course it's beer. 


Cheap beer.
 

High school beer. 


And as your ringing him up you think of how much fun you used to have at parties until he started showing up. Until he held you under his arm and poured beer over your head in front of the whole party. You think of how many parties you must have missed because of that incident. 
	

And this guy who made you the self-conscious,  and body odor. His smell is his life. And as he goes to reach in his wallet you can't help, but notice a couple of his fingers are missing. Partially. The last joint on his index and middle finger. The second joint on his ring. Gone. And of course he can't help but notice you noticing.
	

Construction accident.
	

These words he mutters under his breath before he collects his things and turns to leave. And for a moment you feel bad for him. You pity him. He makes you hate him more
	

*Do you have any jobs available?*
	

This man who made cry most nights out of fear during elementary school. This guy who is the reason your parents wanted to sign you up for therapy. This guy who made you contemplate ending your life in high school is asking you for a fucking job. Your fucking job.
	

And you take a moment to take it in. A thousand different responses flood your brain
	

*Do you know who I am?*

They neared the end of the carpet. Where her fiance stood, her father tightly squeezed her hand, forcing a quick, brief smile at the relatives who stood by their sides.


There they were. Her father hugged her fiance, he says, managing a trembling smile. He leaned down and softly kissed her lips. He held his lips on hers for a long time.


He rose, with his tears softly hitting the rose petals littered around the polished oak box. He straightens to his full height, turns around, and walks away.

Trapped under a code of unspoken law existed a helpless body, each of these full of thought, yet thoughtless creatures would be unknowingly blessed with the burden of life. A task, which looked at through rosy glasses could resemble a noble quest, or an extended search for unjustified appreciation. In truth, the task was the opposite, instead of associating, this species openly chose to disassociate, thus loving itself for what it wasn’t
 

  
Passive and expecting change, but left to self. This creature often attempted to distinguish itself by claiming individuality so it could stand freezing whilst lying on a sweltering background. It was only an imaginary feature that allowed a pulse of self-sanity to remain omniscient. Memories that multiplied the sense of no escape crafted a promise that was already gone, a regret that recommended the colour of black and white. Fraudulence and deceit left a heavy head and feet made of stone, a quest lost, a quest stopped and a quest that questioned a deeper conscience. A painful smile and frown of anticipation, this creature was a twisted yet simple manifestation of everything that it wasn’t and nothing that it was.

1369102969.0,1eqlfb,Deathbed Confession,OOOHJEAH,12,2,7,"It had taken everything else from him. His feelings began to fade in August of the previous year. Tiredness bled into torpor

At this point

He’d been contemplating it for the past few months now. The question now was not a matter of do or do not, he hated blood. He would jump, but he couldn’t stand heights.

A train would do it, the raw power of ungodly machine, it all seemed morbidly attractive. He would have described it as a type of romantic if he had the feelings to find the words. He had found his end. And so it was settled: he would sacrifice the last of himself to the condition that had taken the rest of him. 

He put on his Sunday best for his final hurrah. When they found his body he wanted it to look good. At least, though? Two years ago, the real him never would have imagined that he would go down like this, a prisoner of his own life, a victim of his own mind.

If he was really going to do this

The rails were surprisingly cold for early September. The trees on either side of the tracks had just begun to shed their leafy vestiges in a snow of orange and red. Perhaps it was appropriate that the forest around him was accompanying him in his demise. As they slowly died


What had really brought him so low? In the days before his demise

The first sign of the incoming train was the buzz he felt on his head. A light vibration that might have been pleasant if he remembered what pleasant was. The light vibration slowly and methodically became an incessant rattle. His heart fluttered with the frequency of pulsating rails. If he remembered what to call it

What came after the train hit him? He didn’t let himself believe in a god. Would it be blackness? Would it be peaceful? Painful? Immediate? Eternal? He lacked the answers to the questions he had; this wasn’t the best location to ponder life’s mysteries. Or was it? He hadn’t felt this alive in his whole life. His whole body was quaking with an unnatural tension that frightened him. How could he let himself die when he felt so far from death? He had doubts.

Was this actually what he wanted to do? The rattle from moments before became a thunder in less time than he would have liked. The train was fast approaching and he was frozen in place

I turn the dial on the knob next to my bed. The lamp glows, do you remember that?

On my table lies a folded note I once had written long ago to you. The paper, sitting in my English class.

    Swish
    Why this happened I don't know
    The man is dead this much is true
    His body hangs

    A cotton rope would form a noose
    Not too tight
    His life had flashed before his eyes
    Ending in a suicide

    Pitter-patter
    Everybody feels the blame
    For a while
    But in the end nobody cared

I remembered about how I used to be angry all the time. Angry at my family for some dumb reason. Angry at the world for being the harsh reality that it is. Angry at myself for not quite fitting into the world

As I walk down my street

What would I do if we met again? If I could see you once more? *I* certainly don't know. I wouldn't like you to see the way I live my life nowadays

I think about what I used to live for. I realize that my biggest reason to live was for people who needed me

  ""You said you dumped her?""

  He swigged his beer. I drank my coffee.  We were on the porch and it was early daytime. 

  ""Yeah

  I said

  ""Shit."" He said

  I looked out across the lawn, I could only see his eggy skin and blue eyes that I figured must be almost dead up close. He cracked a beer and drank from the can. He kept an eye towards us.

  Johnny started kinda giggling next to me. He wasn't looking out, ""Yeah, she was pretty mad. You wanna hear something?""

  ""Sure.""

  ""Ok, because I'd only woken up when she got up to take a shit or something. And I'm still all comfortable in bed when she comes back in, you know, after crappin' her brains out, well, THEN she starts being frisky. Don't get me wrong, I love to do her. But I wasn't so tired I hadn't pictured her crappin' out all those lentils she eats. I mean I know what that shit does to me.""

  I stopped listening. I stopped nodding my head. I lit another cigarette and looked into my empty mug. His words slipped past me. The old man was in his garage then. He seemed to move about carrying the weight of hopeless burdens. He scuffed his boots on the pavement. He put on his work gloves.

  ""After everything, you know it's so goddam curly and after getting pulled on a bit, it's just a fucking mane. It gets everywhere and I'm laying there and it gets in my mouth and I'm like, 'Fuck!' You know?""

  I was a beat late on this cue. 

  ""Shit, you out of coffee, you fuckin' pussy faggot?"" He said, ""If you're going in there, grab me another one.""

  I went in and was back out when I saw the old timer across the way. He had   two black trash-cans out in the driveway

  ""Man,' but I guess this is alright.""

  ""Just shut up and drink it."" I said

   We drank our liquids and watched the old man perform. He looked methodical

  ""Still nothin'."" 

  ""Nothing?""  

  ""Yeah

  I said

  ""I'm tellin ya

  Johnny drank his beer and looked at his phone. We heard a large engine start up. Pretty soon, I figured the soft old bastard must like riding a fancy mower better than dying behind an old, heavy push.

  ""Honestly dude

  ""What could have happened?""

  "" I don't know. I'm sure she's just crying or sleeping or something

  ""Maybe she...""

  ""Oh my God

  ""Well.""

  ""This one time, but it was still pretty awesome fucking her. Anyway, she said she had heard of some new vaginal condom or diaphragm or something that she was gonna get. She said it was gonna be just for me, cause she knew I hate condoms and I told her I wanted to cum in her.""

  The old man was making quick work with his mower. The blade cut clean through his Bermuda without tearing it. He nudged up against the flower bed too

  ""So about three days before my twenty-first, none are really superstars or anything. Nothing I couldn't live without, but, anyway I'm sensin' that this 'Her-and-I' thing is just gonna fuck me up on what should be the funnest day of my life. So I just ditched her cause I wanted to sleep with Shannon because Shannon's got such big tits. Well, it gets time to meet up with my girl and I'm drunk so I call her. I told her that her pussy is too loose and that I don't want her busted ass anymore. Oh man, she went nuts.""

   ""Makes sense

  ""Yeah, and she's not happy, but I get her to talk to me and I get her to let me come over. 
  
""It was funny, but I got her back into bed. I don't know how, man, I was fucking drunk as shit, but I did, and I fucked her until I puked.""

  ""What?""

 ""Yeah."" He smiled.

  ""You twisted son of a...""

  ""Haha

  ""Jesus

  ""I dumped her for real."" He said, but not because she was mad, but because she wanted me back.

  ""She was sending me shit like, but then she'd say stuff like, 'I want you to cum in my pussy cause I just found my diaphragm I'd been telling you about. I'll let you fuck me all night Johnny, I swear. Just come pick me up, Baby. Please. Please Johnny, come back and let me have it!' 

  ""I mean I was blown away by that shit. All the time though

  ""Just like that?""

  He said

  ""Well maybe she'll text you.""

  ""Yeah."" He said, just to make sure she's ok.""

  I looked at the old man who was shutting off his mower. Slowly

  Johnny started stirring and it was hot outside so I started moving to head back inside.

  ""I don't know dude, she owns you. You know what I'm saying? You gotta prove to yourself that she isn't the only bitch you can get. I say you find that Shannon girl and smack those tits around just because you can. Then, maybe, think about goin' back to the 'same-old, same-old' bitch who apparently fucking loves you for some stupid fucking reason.""

  ""Damn dude

  ""Let the big dog eat

  Johnny laughed hard and said real loud and deep

  We laughed and high-fived before Johnny went in checking his phone for numbers. I heard him inside saying, girl?""

  I flicked a dead cigarette butt into my yard

  He turned away and started into his house. The door was open as he slowly crossed the threshold and I heard what must've been his wife playing piano. A happy grandma-laugh burst as her song was abruptly halted. I heard her laugh again, and then their laughter went hidden.

He sees something florescent. It's glowing. It's calling is name. He must get to it. He needs it. He must find what is giving off such an enticing shade of green.

He pushes past every person in his way--young, small, male, female-- he doesn't care. He needs to see it. He needs to touch it. Running as fast as he can, it only seems to get farther away.
Oh

He's getting closer; he can feel it.

*""But it still looks so far away.""* He thought.

He pushes a small girl aside and she hits the ground. And then she was gone. The girl had disappeared. James stopped running.

*""where did she go?""*

James looked around.

*""Where did everyone go?""*

The street that was a blur with people, and sounds moments ago was now inexplicably empty and so very quiet. He turned his body back to it's original position and saw there, lying in the street, the glowing thing that vexed him so.

He started slowly towards it with sure steps

*""Finally.""*

He stopped a foot-and-a-half away from the object and lowered himself to the ground. he reached his hand out to touch it and just as fast as everyone disappeared

*""I don't remember the sun setting. It all happened so fast.""*

He looked back to the ground to find that the object--like the little girl-- had gone.
Speechless

Anger and loss made it's way from the bottom of his stomach to the top of his lungs, the street was gone.

Falling through the blackness
How long had he been falling? Weeks? Months? It felt more like years. 

As time passed

*""Will I be falling forever?""*

Instantaneously, and his mouth gave way to vomit and then blood. His lungs contracted and expelled all air from it's passages.

Writhing there, his lungs finally relaxed, allowing oxygen to enter. Coughing and gasping, James saw out of the corner of his eye, a faint green glow.

He turned his head and saw the object lying there. The way it sat there

*""I have to destroy it.""*

He searched himself for any shred of strength. He stretched his arms out in from of him and started to drag himself toward the object that he now hated. He drug himself until he saw that

Dejected

**plink**

He looked at the stone floor and saw a little white lump. He picked it up and looked closer.
There in his hands

**plink**

He looked down and found another. Confused

**plink**

Another tooth. And another. And another.
James tried to put them back in his mouth

The high-pitched squeal of heavy machinery met his ears and bright flash blinded him.

It had only been a few days since we had left the mainland, the destruction and rate of infection had exploded.

Within 24 hours of the firsts, hundreds of thousands deep, and with large explosions from tanks and bombs, came even wider contamination due to the chemicals in the corpses being disturbed and pushed higher into the atmosphere. It had become airborne...

The only escape was to rural areas

""LAAAAAAND!""

An island... Those in charge had said that there we would be safe from any sort of infection. We were students and teachers. Soldiers and doctors. Men, quite possibly, one of the few hopes for maintaining the species.

""Where the hell are we?"" Sgt. Reynolds barked at one of the older gentlemen who had been appointed captain of the vessel. The original captain was... well

There were only a few dozen of us who had made it onto the ship from the harbor. It was a miracle any of us had made it off the mainland alive
Zombies. They were fucking zombies. All of the films and stories had done nothing more than make us lower our guard as to how real a possibility the walking dead were.

""I have no idea
Most everyone was on deck, it was our new home, for now anyways. I, for one, was eager to get off the ship. I had always been afraid of the emptiness of the ocean. Funny how little your fear of the unknown matters when you’re faced with fear of something much greater and much more terrifying. Still, it felt great to know I would be able to step off of that heap I considered to be my floating coffin.
Staring at the coastline

My eyes locked onto something in the underbrush as we closed in further on the island. Something reflective... but what? The relief turned to panic as I realized what I was staring at. We were being watched. Those were eyes.

I glanced around for Reynolds. We needed to be prepared that we might have company when we landed. The undead? Impossible. Not this far out
""Start unloading some supplies for a reconnaissance team to check out the island and we'll see if we can find any food

I had convinced myself that I just needed to get off of the boat when a shriek erupted from the forest. A sound like nothing I had ever heard. The sound of a screaming jet engine combined with the emotional tones of something living... something communicating. Birds flew from the canopy of the forest as we all stared silently into the mysterious interior of the island.

What I feel right now is inharmonious. The whole reason I came to these groups in the first place is to feel included
	

You see when you're in a room full of people who would do anything for a couple of extra years of life, when it's my turn to speak the room is furnished with exaggerated sighs, and rolling eyes. 
	

More and more it seems like the only time I feel alone is when I'm surrounded by people.
	

If it were just about them I wouldn't be here. In fact if it were anyone else, but when you're as emotionally unstable as me feelings like love come pretty easily.
	

Even if I wasn't suffering from any mental anguish, not exactly divine, but still a masterpiece. 
	

I had it bad for this girl, whisk her away, and ride into the sunset together? And just as my imagination started to get carried away the opportunity presented itself. 
 

Martha Goldstein was in the middle of detailing her struggle in the late stages of ASL, and by the time it came to Benjamin Bloom and his battle with Huntington's disease Jenna Lane had fallen asleep on my shoulder. 
	

And what I feel right now is elated.
	

By the time the group is over my shirt is soaked in saliva. People stand up to put away their chairs and grab a cup of coffee
	

After she had woken up she apologized profusely for the falling asleep on me
	

As we walked she told me about what school she had gone to, and to be honest I didn't retain much of anything she said. I was too overjoyed that I, the suicidal self-loathing guy that not even people on the verge of death liked, had the opportunity to walk Jenna to her car. 
	

When we reached her vehicle I was disappointed by how short the walk was. We exchanged awkward goodbyes
	

The words fell clumsily from my mouth but she didn't seem to notice. Instead she just smiled
	

This is how I met Jenna Lane.
	

I know in theory you are supposed to wait a couple days before calling a girl, and forty-seven minutes before I finally caved. 
	

Before I called her I spent at least twenty minutes planning out what I was going to say
	

""Did you call me to ask me out?"" she asks. And I recover just enough of myself to reply with a feeble ""yes.""
	

""Well I would love to go on a date with you
	

And what I feel right now is lucky.
	

I take Jenna to play mini golf, and when I dropped my cone face down on my lap she pretends not to notice, and offers to share hers. 
	

As I drive her home there is no room for silence. My car is filled with laughter and conversation the entire ride. I pulled up to her house
	

She asks me when she can expect to see me next
	

Over the next couple of months I see Jenna Lane more and more.  And over the next couple of months life doesn't seem so bad. It didn't matter what we did. We could watch paint dry for all I cared, or brain cancer. 
	

It was a Tuesday when she told me to come over to her house. We had plans for a date Thursday night
	

""I want you to have sex with me
	

And being the smooth talking man I am I responded with a delayed ""What?""
	

""Sexual intercourse. You know what that is
	

And the sad thing was it was true. She was dying. The light in her eyes had dimmed, and done something romantic that may or may not have involved candles and rose petals, and maybe some fireworks, but who was I do deny a girl her dying wish? 
	

We fuck. At least that's what it feels like. Nothing more nothing less. I pray that she's a virgin
	

What I want her to do is make a mistake
	

There are empty spaces in everyone's lives. I'd like to think that we try the best we can to make sure those places are filled. But no matter hard you try there are going to be those moments that leave you feeling empty. There's that pretty girl at the coffee shop that you wanted to talk to, and hearts that we never had the chance to break.
	

Jenna understood this. She had accepted her fate. She knew that soon she would be nothing more than a corpse rotting in the ground. She had no time for love
	

And what I feel right now is cheated. 
	

Because all of this is an illusion. The walk to the car
	

The saliva drips through my shirt
	

Still she profusely apologizes
	

After everything is taken down I help Jenna carry the platter in which she brought cookies on to her car
	

As she's packing the platter and leftover cookies into her trunk
	

""My boyfriend and I are actually going to play mini-golf tonight
	

""Sure
	

And what I feel right now is broken.
	

We exchange awkward goodbyes. As I extend my hand she extends hers

Friday.
Ryan leaves us, I decided not to grace the cats with my presence again just yet.
 
Saturday Evening.
I arrive to feed and water the cats. Simon is friendly
 
Sunday.
The cats starve and dry out
 
Monday Evening.
I stop by on my way from the movies with a friend, while Lionel is nearby, and fatter. Sasha confirms my analysis.
 
Tuesday Night.
I arrive late, and, finally, complete furtending. Having nowhere else to hang my work clothes for the next day, I prop open the bedroom door and hang them off the top. This lets Simon sit on the living room table and stare into the bedroom, into my eyes, and into my soul, slowly falling asleep and staring at me through drooping eyelids as the minutes pass. I have broken his sense of order and he is no longer nice to me. Without shifting his gaze
 
Wednesday Morning.
The first thing I see upon leaving the bedroom is Lionel rolling over to expose his belly. This is irresistible and just about cancels out having a shorter commute to work. Soon after, he graciously lifts his head, allows my hand to rise up to meet his cheek, and proceeds to push it down to the ground again. This repeats.
 
Wednesday Evening.
I arrive, and scratches flow furily. Sasha titles Simon Flat-Face. In response, his face is emotionless, flat, and furry. Lionel adopts the name Fat-Face, and my hand. I will file to reclaim custody shortly. Sasha sleeps over, being offered the bedroom while I claim the couch as my own.
 
Night between Wednesday and Thursday.
Sasha wakes up to see Simon inches away from her face
 
Thursday Morning.
Lionel is adorable. Simon is a cat.
 
Thursday Evening.
A different friend comes over. Lionel remains fat while Simon remains a cat. Together, their hides being fat, and hidden.
 
Friday Morning.
Reclined on the couch with my hand scratching the nearby Lionel, just once, I choose to not spend every free moment scratching Lionel? Still purring like a tractor with a megaphone, Lionel jumps up onto the couch, wanders across my body and then, first gently, then heavily, leaning his side against my face and forcing his furriness into every crevice
 
Sunday Evening.
I stop by to pick up my things and scratch Lionel. He seems to have acquired a better invisible megaphone
 
Monday.
I miss them.
 
Tuesday.
I miss them.

1334850917.0,shyjc,500 word post-apocalyptic story I wrote today. I hope you like it :),WoutervD,11,4,7,"Viktor sneaked inside the remnants of a collapsed parking garage just in time. Two Toxins walked by, and his private army of Toxins patrolling the streets

Viktor himself had been recruited as a Toxin. He was plucked from the street and had to start training under strict surveillance. After the first round, speed and intelligence to train for the elite squad, Tox' personal guards. This also meant the surveillance measured were slacked. Within a week Viktor had crafted a knife of a piece of bent metal and some charred wood, held it to a guards' throat and ran of. That's why he had to be so careful to stay out of sight.  

The wisest thing would be to hide, he wasn't afraid of some blood on his hands.

It's not as if he walks through the street randomly cutting out young boys' gobs, he was one of the oldest boys still alive. When the collision drew near, it was decided that all fifteen-year-olds would live. They were old enough to take care of themselves and eventually reproduce, but young enough to adapt and create government in the new world. When all the fifteen-year-olds were saved, the remainder of places in the bunkers was distributed to anyone between twelve and eighteen. Viktor had been lucky, unlike many.

The silence was pierced by a shuffling sound and Viktor turned with a start. There was no one there, then dropped dead. It tumbled off of the beam it was crawling over, into the basement of the garage. It was a shame to lose that knife, but Viktor was happy. In the end, he would only need one. Tox' lair was in sight and his training, carried out all alone in the woods, proved solid.

""So

I can feel my heart sink into my stomach

Images forever burned into my conscience.

How we got into this situation was the same for most of us: we wanted to heroes.  Granted, the idea of ending another man's life without consequence, maybe even praise, had to impact his decision in some way. He could have chose a safer job... Anything but Combat Arms. But why fix the damage when you can inflict the damage?  You're a joke if you get a medal for making sure everyone gets paid on time. 

In the long run all we really want is recognition. 

One-hundred and thirty-eight days in country and not a single thing to write home about. You could feel the hostility in the air. Each and every one of us were growing tired of the monotony. All we wanted was a real reason to clean our weapons. And this is the insanity that the US Military inflicts among its indentured servants. Train a man to kill

I couldn't see what I was shooting at, and it felt good. The lesson I learned that day is that Positive Identification isn't always necessary. Before I get ahead of myself, let me explain. Those bastards thought they could run into a Mosque and they would be safe. Well, your Holy Place isn't mine. Your God can't judge me. Out here, life is a gift, and you have to be willing to take that gift away without a second thought about it. 

Out here

With my adrenaline pumping I guess I didn't notice what time it was... it just slipped my mind. All that matters is the target was eliminated; mission complete. The weight had immediately been lifted off my shoulders. I finally got what I was looking for and I felt vindicated.  

After the C4 blast there wasn't much left of the Mosque, and a sense of nausea overcame me. I stumbled upon what appeared to be a hand - a tiny little hand. I had never seen gore like this. A hand, a foot, an arm, a leg. Things unrecognizable as human. What have I done? These people weren't the enemy. These were human beings like you and I. Men, women, and children reduced to humps of body parts. I can never look at a hamburger the same way again.

concrete wall in this small
reminds me of when I was younger and would play in puddles after a 
storm; the only difference is now I am a middle aged adult and I don’t
 have any shoes. Chills race through my body as my weak heart pushes
 me through another cold night. I can hear pain-driven moans of other
 middle aged men in other rooms much like my own. I haven’t been able
 to keep a meal down for days and I think my body is finally giving up
 on me. It smells like a high school bathroom that hasn’t been washed in
 weeks
 the nose of a hog. All I wish for in these hopeful final hours is a room
 mate
 tell my story to
 louder. I could try and lay in my mattress
 on something that isn’t mine. This isn’t the jail life that is romanticized
 on TV and in books

	It all started in the year 2024 when the government started telling
 everyone of the wonderful life that could be possible if we accept a few
 changes in how society is. That should have been the first indication of
 hell; we should have known from the beginning that nothing good
 comes when people try to change what feels natural. We embraced it
 though
 doors knew what was good for us. They told us the only sacrifice we
 would make is breaking a few friendships and that this would only be a
 sacrifice for a closer society and a closer web of companions. Their big
 plan in a nutshell was to organize people like files in a computer. We
 would be organized by occupation
 bureaucracy of social status. The people never really changes
 change was a mass feeling of loneliness; that was our second chance to
 realize this couldn’t work
 years
 as. There was a business sector, a
 sector for just about every occupation
 occupation would fit into. 

	The worst of these sectors was Sector 213; this was where they
 sent everyone that could not work or was not willing to work. I was
 never there,
 there was a commitment that was needed in the new society. The only
 way information was spread between sectors was through the internet
 but the internet turned out to be as honest as the men that set up our
 new lives. Sector 213 consisted of everyone from drug dealers to
 hitmen to the mentally handicapped to the mentally insane. The types
 of people varied drastically
 the internet were trustable
 in Sector 213. Everyone knew what types of people lived here from the
 handbook given to every citizen of the new society
 sectors and what group of people belonged to them. Sector 213
 consisted of “noncontributing individuals.” The details of Sector 213 are
 not important to the grand scheme of what ended up being this nation
 by  the year 2031

	Times were alright after awhile; people were feeling connected
 and sector life became centered around what people actually did with
 their lives
 Problems started coming with the children. Children could not be born
 into an occupation; as much as the they wished we could be computers
 we weren’t. They found a solution. They promised happiness and
 wellbeing to our children. This was our third and final chance to see
 where this was all leading
 to Sector 864
 more centered around work
 family. People began to forget what having a family even was.

	Stories of pain and chaos stopped showing up on the internet
 replaced by stories of success and happiness in other sectors. I thought
 my sector was special
 and my brothers and sisters
 sector. We wrote manuals
 things apart
 maybe my sector was sad because there was no advances to be made
 in our occupation
 steps to putting together and taking apart things made by other sectors.
 Honestly
 friends that I worked with and got drunk with occasionally. It was one
 night in particular that really got my thoughts changing.

	We were drinking beers and sitting in my friend Mark’s living
 room. We were laughing and making fun of some of the things we were
 writing manuals for
 before all the changes happened
 change. He started talking about this book that people would write in
 and it would help others understand what you do for a living; you would
 write in as much depth as you chose about your job and what you do.
 There was obviously no need for it anymore after all the changes
 Dan bringing this up brought up a rush of nostalgia. I felt myself sink
 into the couch I was sitting in as my mind began to wander into
 memories of my family. I had a brother and two sisters
 twins. Luckily they ended up in the same sector because they were
 exceptional athletes. I felt my heat sinking a little into my chest and I
 began to miss my life from before the change. The change that struck
 me at that moment that I never realized before was the lack of
 curiosity. There was nothing new
 there was nobody else besides yourself. Everyone in a sector was
 almost an exact clone of each other. I began to feel more lonely than I
 did ever before that moment.

	Every day after that dreadful night felt like a repeat of the day
 before
 longer
 to lose hope in a life that meant anything. I wanted to matter
 more than anything to not be a clone in some sector where everyone is
 the same and just another gear pushing this nation along. I decide it
 was time for change.

	I began working out a way to escape my sector. I looked through
 the handbook and found which sectors I wanted to go to: Sector 213
 “artists,” Sector 110, “psychologists,” and
 Sector 54
 Sector 1 was where the leaders were living; nobody knew anything
 about it. I had no idea how I would even get out of my sector
 more planning and surveying of the wall that confined my sector. I
 planned on leaving and heading east
 could find a pattern or organization of the sectors.

	I finally left in 2030. I found a hole in the wall that I could crawl
 through. Outside of this hole
 before
 even dream of anymore. I smelled trees and nature
 park I went to as a child
 tears leaking from my eyes. I stepped out of the bubble that help my
 life for a few long years. I forgot what real weather was like
 frigid cold begin to climb up my legs. I took a few steps
 hours
 was about twenty feet from the wall when I heard a loud
 noise pierce through my skull. An alarm.

	There was an alarm going off in my sector
 even more as I turned around to look. I felt every muscle in my body
 begin to tense up and every hair on my arms and legs raise
 the cold air feel even crisper. I saw a tall tower that I somehow missed
 while living in the sector
 me. I could see the look in their eyes
 just saw a deer that walked away from its pack. The look that burned
 into my brain and felt like hours as I saw the man raise a gun
 frozen. There was nothing I could do anymore
 was in that gun to pierce my skin and take me away. I was unaware of
 what happened next

	This is where I am now. My life lasted another year I estimate it
 to be. After everything that happened
 change
 as alone as I was in Sector 858. I don’t know any of the other men in
 this jail
 with. I never learned about any other sectors
 there are other sectors anymore. I can’t be sure there are other people
 besides the ones I hear moaning every day. I guess you can never be
 certain of anything that isn’t you. I realized the only truth I ever knew
 what what I felt inside. I wish I had realized what was happening from
 the beginning
 to change what I knew was natural. I don’t regret anything I did
 regret what I didn’t do sooner.

1361534713.0,190mhy,[True Story] Friends and I found underground tunnels under high school in Wisconsin (with pictures),Johspwns,9,1,8,"Hey Redditors. Iv'e decided to share my story. Iv'e always been fascinated by breaching security

I don't know if this really belongs on short stories


**TL;DR**
Some friends and i discovered unknown secret tunnels under our high school. Over weeks we discovered and mapped out a big part of the tunnel system. 


[WHOLE PHOTOALBUM](http://imgur.com/a/wCbdH)

I'm now 18 and only have memories and pictures to look back at. 
Last school year (2011/2012) I was an exchange student in USA, and started school. This happened exactly one year ago. 

It all started with a friend of mine (senior at the time) came to me and said he had something crazy to tell me. It was kind of a rush hour so i didn't have time to stop and listen. Later that day we met in lunch break and he told me that he had been in the schools maintenaince room and had seen a dark square (3x3 ft) in the wall down a staircase. He that it was some kind of underground tunnel system under the school. I thought he was stupid and didn't think much about it. 
Now in the school i attended for a year and the daily routine consisted of normal classes and a 9th hour/homeroom in the end of the day

I forgot all about his  little tunnel story and almost two weeks went by till we came by the subject again. I was sitting peacefully in 9th hour and doing my homework when i saw someone knocked on the door. I looked up and there was my friend
He wrote me a pass and I walked silently but determined out. Christian basically bombed me with the information that he had been ""in the tunnels"". I thought he was being crazy again and laughed at him

A few days later I couldn't help my curiosity. I had to see if this was true. In 9th hour I got a pass to go to the restroom and knowing I had limited time i rushed down the long hallways with a friend to the mechanical maintenance room. I quickly entered, down a staircase, down a ladder, into what seemed like a small pool around 7 ft deep, in the corner was a little square entering. I could barely spot it with my phone light. I crawled down and had a quick peek inside. After this i was eager to crawl in and look, but i had already been gone for 20 minutes, and i knew that would only cover for a long toilet visit, or when I did it

[Entering](http://imgur.com/a/wCbdH#M5Sg1EM)


The next day I couldn't wait for 9th hour. The day went by so slow and it seemed like forever till the class started. Thinking that the teacher wouldn't write me a pass if i asked to go to the restroom right after a 6 minutes break, ran down the stairs, down the ladder in to the pool and went in the tunnel. I had asked Christian to meet me there at 3:20. He showed up and told me that he actually didn't go in that hole, but in another path about 6 ft long that went into the basement in the other side of the room. 
I checked it out and it wasn't even a path
Everytime we took a right or left turn there were turns both ways, excitement and a crapload of dust and dirt in the air, it got really hard to breath in there, and we went out. Up in the normal school light we were sweaty, and covered with an orangy dust powder.

[Christian](http://i.imgur.com/pN9vCym.jpg)

We had to see more. But we needed to plan it out. We couldn't just go to the restroom every day and coming back looking like we attended World War II. Teachers would get suspicious, gloves, painting masks for dust, camera, change of clothing, blueprints and pencils. I managed to steal a whole block of passes so we could fake signatures and write passes to study hall, library or other teachers classrooms to cover up our actions.
Also we needed a different time to enter
We came up with bringing a mirror to look around the edges when we exited the room. 
In the school there was a red blueprint painting hanging in the wall. I took a snapshot of it and after 15 minutes with my enormously bad photoshop skills i made it black and white and printed some copies out. 

[Blueprint we drew on](http://i.imgur.com/b9EKbhe.jpg)

We were now ready to note every single little turn we explored under there. We also got two other friends involved

[We were PROJECT BELOWSCHOOL](http://i.imgur.com/f87aNSE.jpg)

Friday night there was a basketball game at the school. 
What a perfect opportunity. School was open and no one in the hallways. We packed bags from home. Once the game was on, a flashlight guy, a map writer and a camera guy at the end. We had also purchased 1000 ft of line that we tied somewhere in the maintenance room. and took with us in. It functioned as a kind of safety so we always could find our way out. After almost 2 hours in there. We went out. We had discovered endless turns and paths and about 700 ft of tunnel was mapped down. 

[Underground](http://i.imgur.com/RyDQacv.jpg)

The following fridays we planned to go down there again. We knew the routine, classrooms and and all the other rooms. I'm a big guy 6'4"", and i had quite some trouble crawling around down there. One of the times i was freaking out because I was running (as good as possible down there) and I got breathless because of the dust. After that I never did anything physical exhausting while in the tunnels. 

We went down there about four times and the last time was the most interesting. It was only me and Christian

[Hardees cup](http://i.imgur.com/andGS3I.jpg)

[Cans](http://i.imgur.com/DmrT9WM.jpg)

We continued and saw a yellow pipe running across the path. We spend about 5 minutes discussing what it was
We continued into a big wide space. The feeling of standing up for the first time in three hours was amazing. It was exactly under the staircase. There was a metal plate in the wall

[Under the staircase](http://i.imgur.com/0hM84eA.jpg)

[Metal plate 1](http://i.imgur.com/gkYteFf.jpg)

[Metal plate 2](http://i.imgur.com/HLApYWx.jpg)

We had found another entering. Unfortunately it was locked. We also looked up in a hole with a bunch some pipes and wires and discovered a bag of funions shoved up in there. How the heck did these come up there? We took a few pictures and took the 25 minute journey crawling all the way out. We jumped through the little hole to the basement and exit through there. No one saw us. Monday morning we went above ground of where we were on the friday. We looked down the thermostat of a radiator and concluded that the bag of funions were down there

So I tore it down. By myself. With a good chunk of my expendable funds

“Well… what did you see?” he asked, news camera crews, journalists, and anyone else who wanted exclusive information was jammed into the already cramped room. If I had more of an ego, I may have enjoyed the attention. Perhaps even more so if I had anything to tell them.

They thought I was the perfect candidate, knew that I was the opposite. The first time, I had caught cholera, and had nearly died in Nottingham. The second, a stray Mongol arrow had all but pierced my heart. The rest are a jumble of disease, famine, natural disasters, as I was about to die

If it hadn't been news of the meteor, as it always does. People began to panic, rioters hit the streets, and religious extremists gained billions of followers. Of course, nobody knew if the meteor would actually hit; it all depended on the timing. Either a direct collision, pulled by our gravity, or else it will pass extremely close and shoot towards the sun. Impossible to tell.
Then the director had his brilliant plan; if we could see the past, and funding was raised quickly. And who better, he asked, to lead this mission, but the one who had been a part of all previous missions. I tried to oppose, of course, but they wouldn't hear it. I was going.

I knew all along there was nothing to be seen. Even as they were inputting the coordinates, many different ways it could run. Astrologists and prophets appear successful, because they predict the most likely outcome, and brag intelligence or giftedness when it comes about. But there was no likely outcome, no easily discernible pattern to follow. It was one or the other, left or right, death or life. Heads or tails.

I glanced down, but Earth will remain intact.

Celebratory whoops and hollers filled the room, no excitement, as I wait until the day the meteor would arrive. If I were to be honest with myself, I hope it hits us.

She shakes off my cold demeanor. “You’re a fantastic writer, and you would read to me, read your stories and poems? I know how well you can write.”

I lean back in my chair and I remember back to those days she mentioned. Things were different back then. The writing was different, superficially about my writing, but implying things much deeper.

She looks at me for a moment

“I can’t

Rebecca takes the length of blue cotton off her hands and closes the distance between us with a few awkward steps. I turn my back to her and tie my hair in a ponytail. The other girls watch with interest. This is the first time I have actively participated in any of the games that didn’t involve drinking. Everything goes dark as the knot cinches at the back of my head. 

“Can you see anything?” Patricia asks the question

“Then let’s go. Unless you’re afraid of the dark.” 

A biting retort reaches my lips and I hold it down, and not a subtle way to intimidate me.  In an attempt to just be friendly a smile spreads across my lips and I shake my head.

“Not afraid of the dark

Someone, guides me towards the door. 

“Just count to twenty

The 6 girls take off in different directions, determined to play this silly game with as much seriousness as I can muster. If I am being completely honest, The Walk seems mostly like an initiation into this new group. The fact that we drew straws is my only consolation that this wasn’t some form of twisted setup. Once again I remind myself that these girls are followers of Patty’s whims, and not the gossiping malicious one I left behind when I transferred. 

A deep breath fills my lungs with the cool fall air, but without my vision it’s running wild. I take the first step off the porch and slowly walk forward. A rustle of leaves to my right catches my attention and I quickly turn my head in that direction, tripping a bit as I do so. Obviously my brain has forgotten that I’m blindfolded. The uncertainty of the situation nags at my anxiety, but I take another deep breath to calm myself. 

 “It’s just a game.” An inner mantra begins repeating itself

A scream dashes through the air

“That’s really funny

There’s no response to my announcement

Another scream, these girl’s are going above and beyond to scare me. 

“Patty, and for the first time I a m a little bit worried. 

More screams and the sound of running fill the air until I can’t even hear the leaves under my own feet. 

“Annalise, signaling that I have successfully completed the walk. I don’t even reach upwards, determined not to fall for their tricks.   

The screaming eventually quiets down

“Patty?” 

No response.

Still no response. I know that I’ll never hear the end of it for chickening out, and I need to see what was happening around me, I need to be reminded that this was just a game. 

My finger pulls at the knot holding the blindfold on and it eventually falls to the ground at my feet. I blink several times, covered in blood with a knife in one hand, and Rebecca’s head in the other. 

A twisted smile. A knife covered in blood. A terrified girl running away through the woods.

I hate the drops. Drops were the worst. The idea behind performing these “tactical insertion operations” is to “selectively disrupt enemy production capability” but most of us jarheads just think of it as a bug stomp. We drop in near a bug hive and kill everything we see, than jump out. Word from intel said that the main swarm was on the move to southern ridge of our base. They had already eaten their way through Camp Eagle and Camp Limley here on Typhon and were itching for a third meal and, since we were the last remnants of Limley, we were tagged with the “opportunity” as Lt. Korvic calls it. So here we were in the APOD-33, me and seven of my buddies jammed in tighter than a porn stars cooze at a gang bang. The only thing that could make it better would be if a flock of Muta’s showed up while we were flying over the canyons. They look like worms with wings, worms that shoot bug bullets out of there asses. I’ve seen these bullets, these “glaive worms” as the brain boys like to call them

Dawn is hitting the eastern side of the ship. Drop time is coming up soon. I bark the command to perform pre-drop prep. Each of my guys reads out the HUD on their medical conditions then they start their own suit diagnostics followed by weapons checks. All of this information is relayed back to my suit which I pass on to Korvic. This was all done prior to loading up but you can never be too sure. I amble my way up to the bow and glance at the windows. It looked completely bright outside but I knew that it really wasn’t. I don’t understand the whole technology behind it but it had something to do with the ships sensors and VR displays or some nonsense.  I could see the hive in the distance, considering the life span of a marine is a long time. A skyscraper made of bruised flesh and bone, once the ship optics focused in you could see that it was crawling with the worm larva. The Intel geeks say that the larvas are “genetically versatile” which meant that they could become almost anything in the swarm, if the right conditions were met. I reminded Korvic to scan the area for any of the growths in the area as a result of those conditions. They say that the growths are similar to tumor. Once the Zerg get wind of opposition around there turf they immediately make some kind of virus which infects one of there worker bugs.  Once the worker bug is ready it becomes a growth feeding off their creep and other shit around the area. The tumor forces the larva to become bigger, badder bugs. They say it’s some kind of “immunal response” from the hive like how white blood cells attack infections in the human body. I don't pretend to understand it, all I know is that blowing up the tumor buildings, yeah buildings, which lord only knows what was growing inside of them. With my luck it'd be Ultras

Korvic’s telling me that conditions look good. We managed to avoid the max range of there Overlords, no drones no minerals. No minerals no bugs. Simple. I shout at my crew, not that it’s necessary, the audio in our armor can filter out the background noise of the ship, but to get them pissed and ready. I remind them what the bugs have done to us, how they are eating everything they see and that they want to be the toughest sons of bitches in the universe. I remind them that once they hit the four year mark they’ll be pardoned and that all the pussy in the universe will love them and thank them for their service. I see glassy eyes and hear grunts and howls. I can tell Korvic’s pinged there suits for stims. We descend very suddenly, then immediately slow, helmets closing on their faces

I woke up and glanced at the clock to the side of me. 5:30. I never woke up that early. Even for school. I felt, somehow. Like I was being watched. Like I was in a movie or a book or something. But it was more than that. I was motivated? I guess? That fits well enough. I was motivated. I wanted to do something.
  I slowly got up and started to get ready for school. I dreaded school. I hated most people there
  I was never bad in school, and knew the right people to not be made fun of, but I just never liked most of the people there. They were cruel and unforgiving. I didn't like them.
  So you're probably wondering why I still went? Well like many people, but she hated me. I only still went to school because I thought I would have a chance of her not hating me. If I just had a chance to talk to her, or something, maybe she wouldn't hate me, like many people do. 
  I honestly don't know why I'm telling anyone this. Nobody cares. But I don't mind. I don't care. I've been told countless times that I could never get her. Or anyone

  I went to school, nothing less. The worst part about school I think was how uneventful it always was.

He talked to me today! I couldn't believe it! Then, ever know that someone, even if it's just me, needs him. 
  School was......school. I mean, but that's the point. The people who decide your social standing are highly unqualified to do so. But do I care? Not in the slightest. I'm not disliked. I'm friendly with pretty much everyone, but mainly, I'm not noticed at all, really. I'm not bothered by that. Trust me, most people at my school, you wouldn't want to notice you, I thought he didn't for awhile. 
  Once, I could care less if the whole world hated me. But not him. Please, not him. 
  The reason I liked him was because you could tell by looking at him that he understood you. Not necessarily everyone

My sister and I visited our grandmother, however, leaving Uncle George incapable of doing even the most insignificant of domestic undertakings. Amma quickly and readily stepped in to assist the incompetent man at his every request. My sister and I were taken along at instances like these and were given explicit instructions to remain in the car. “I’ll only be a second,” Amma would tell us in an uncharacteristically hurried manner. “Just wait here and I’ll be right back.”

How can she expect this from us? Tap, tap

My stomach was a rock within me and at each step my feet felt like lead. I stopped and took one last look up at that grotesque staring face with the gaping mouth, painted with the same sour yellowed paint. The entrance into the very bowels of the house. My hand was sweaty on the gold doorknob, but I quietly turned it and entered.

Immediately the odor of dust, my first instinct was to recoil in fear and repulsion. I took a deep, putrid breath. I needed to know what was going on. At the end of the long hallway I saw a thin sliver of harsh florescent light cast onto the wall from the adjacent room. I could hear someone inside. As I walked along the wall, a growing sense of trepidation filled my small body. I shouldn’t be in here. I was going to get caught. I neared the opening from which the glaring light was coming, and hesitantly peered in.

What I saw was a standard laundry room. Lint covered button-down shirts hung from hangers on a clothesline to dry

Standing in the middle of the room, putting on a pair of rumpled black dress socks. Those were the only item of clothing he was wearing. His ghost-white skin was a stark contrast to the bleak surroundings. With a naive terror, I looked up the long, gangly legs and over the flat, drooping buttocks. The backbone protruded under loose skin and my gaze involuntarily traveled upward as if on some skeletal highway. His extended neck was crowned with a mop of disheveled grey hair that sprung greasy from the pale veined scalp. He was arched over, translucent flesh sagging off the wiry frame like some prehistoric amphibious human being. Claw-like hands were ferociously pulling at the sock on his left foot as he struggled to maintain balance. He had not seen me. With my heart pounding so ferociously that I was sure I’d be caught, I bolted. Shaking with unadulterated horror

Safely back in the car, I hysterically relayed what I had seen. All at once a look came over her worn face that I couldn’t identify. Fear? Insecurity? Anger? She quickly told me that I had seen nothing and warned me never to tell my mother what I had just described to her. She told me that it was going to be alright. That it would be our little secret. And that we were going for ice cream.

Sixteen years later, Amma and my Uncle George were having an affair. What seemed like a considerate sister-in-law helping her less than capable brother was, in reality, a covert sexual escapade begging to be uncovered by the unassuming granddaughter. As the situation was discussed, the pieces fell into place like some sort of perverted relational puzzle. To this day, Amma doesn’t know that we’ve uncovered the disgraceful skeleton in her closet.

I couldn't say ""Well she looks just like Jane Fonda, she's not a movie star...""
I couldn't say that because you dont look like Jane Fonda at all.
I finally ended up describing you as a movie I saw when I was a child in Tacoma Washington. I guess I saw it in 1941 or 42, or six.
It was a movie about rural electrification, and they didn't have any appliances like toasters or washing machines, and they couldn't listen to the radio. They built a dam with big electric generators and they put poles across the countryside and strung wire over fields and pastures.
There was an incredible heroic dimension that came from the simple putting up of poles for the wires to travel along. They looked ancient and modern at the same time.
Then the movie showed electricity like a young Greek god, with the throwing of a switch, the farmer had electric lights to see by when he milked his cows in the early black winter mornings. The farmer's family got to listen to the radio and have a toaster and lots of bright lights to sew dresses and read the newspaper by.
It was really a fantastic movie and excited me like listening to the Star Spangled Banner
I wanted electricity to go everywhere in the world. I wanted all the farmers in the world to be able to listen to President Roosevelt on the radio.

Lying there on the floor, where she was, and why she was here. She couldn't remember; and she was afraid. Did he lock me in this room for something I did? Was this man a guard at this facility? Or were this man's intentions more...malignant? She didn't want to know. She wanted to get out; she had to get out. She had to find some answers. 

She stood up and made her way towards the door, and stared down its sterile walls, glistening in the white light. There were more cells, but there was silence. She was unsure of whether that was a good sign or not. She made for the door at the end of the hallway; it looked different from the rest, perhaps it wasn't a cell, perhaps it was a way out. She hoped it was. When she reached the door, her heart sank; it was locked. 

The key card in the room! It was the only thing she had to go on, she entered and made her way for the card, not noticing that the man had woken up, and was watching her. As she goes to leave the room, she hears an unsettling, animalistic growl. She turns back to see the man, crouching, she notices that his eyes are a yellowish color; like a cat's eyes. His nails had sharpened

Suddenly, she could not move, could not think, could not breath. What made her move wasn't fear of the beast behind her. It was the new sounds she heard. The other cells were alive with movement; something was lurking behind their walls. With an ever deepening sense of terror, she ran towards the door, inserted the key card, and turned the handle; the door opened. The minuscule amount of relief she felt was extinguished when she heard the footfalls of the beast. Without even looking, seeing the beast lunge forward

“It’s like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You waltzed right in, without a care at all.  I was eating a quick dinner and had changed just before you arrived, just in case you ended up being someone I wanted to impress. I had heard so much about you that I was fairly confident we would hit it off, and even though I assumed you were straight, I wanted to be friends with you before I even met you. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Rewind. I had been working at Chili’s that night. Abby told me earlier that she’d finally convinced you to come down with her for the party, changed into a striped v-neck t-shirt that I bought a few weeks earlier in the little boys’ section at Marshall’s because I look good in it, and threw some breaded chicken into the microwave.  I texted Abby to let her know she could come pick me up, since she’d offered and this way I could drink and wouldn’t have to worry about driving. I was a little bit nervous about this, because I knew about the crush Abby had on me and I didn’t want to lead her on – I wasn’t interested in the least – but I felt pretty sure that she knew where I stood.  Turns out, I was wrong, but that’ll come into play later on.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So, and I let her in.  She’s typical Abby – a little nervous, a little awkward, but nice and sweet and all the rest of those generic things that everyone says about everyone else.  Anyway, as I was collecting my alcohol to bring to the party (green apple Smirnoff) and trying to devour my dinner, Abby let slip that you were waiting in the car.  “Tell her to come in!” was obviously my reaction to that.  So, she did.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And that’s where this story began.  You danced in with your twinkling eyes, that was when you had me.  You just came right in, like you owned the place, like we had been friends so long we were practically family… And then we were introduced.  Abby scolded you for just coming in without knocking or anything and I can’t remember if I said anything more than that it was totally okay, but I really liked that you did that.  I liked the way you commanded the room.  I liked how light your command was, too – how it felt more like a plea, or a wish from a fairy or a princess in one of those Disney movies we watched as kids – lovely and pure

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Immediately I knew you were going to cause problems for me, “she’s straight, she’s Abby’s cousin, she’s not interested – don’t even try.”  “No, bad ~~dog~~ girl.”  I was doing well, too! I even caught myself a couple of times and pulled back.  I wanted to flirt so badly, but I kept it in.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Soon, and we piled into Abby’s car to go back to her house where the party was already going on.  We didn’t say a whole lot to each other in the car, but you were happy and smiley and so pretty and way too cool for me, so naturally I was totally captivated.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When we arrived at the party, I was hoping you’d ask to play so I could ask you to be my partner) introduced herself to me as Diamond Princess.  I started calling her DP for short and, as it turns out, those are her real actual initials.  That’s not important to the story; I just thought it was funny.  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Pong went on forever and we just wanted it to end, dancing.  When I watched you dance, the rest of the party was on pause.  Everything stopped – it was just you and the music.  You smiled and laughed and your eyes sparkled.  Abby was right when she said you were more yourself that night than she’d seen in a long time.  Obviously I couldn’t have known that then, because I had never met you before, and I probably can’t even know that now, because that’s the only night I met you, but I believe it because of how alive you seemed.  More full of life than anyone else at the party.  Hard to believe you tried to off yourself the very next day.  Forget social work; you should pursue a career in acting.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We finally finished pong and gave up the table for someone else to play, you love to sing along to every song.  I thought that was just the cutest thing.  That song Some Nights by FUN came on the iPod while we were down there – you continued dancing and we all sang along (or, you know, tried to).  I had forgotten about that until you brought it up via text a few days later, when you said “Every time Some Nights comes on I think about us hanging out in the basement.”  Now it’s a memory I hold onto, and when I hear Some Nights on the radio or on someone’s iPod, it makes me think of you and I feel closer to you for just those four minutes and thirty-seven seconds even though we can’t talk anymore.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Anyway, and we went back and forth for a while, but we ended up on Egyptian Rat Screw – you know, that game where you each put down a card on your turn and you slap the pile on doubles and sandwiches.  I wanted you to play so badly.  You were sitting on the couch not far from me, and I was sitting on the floor somewhat facing you, stealing glances as often as I could manage.  I didn’t win the game, and I couldn’t convince you to play with us

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;About halfway through the game, considering the circumstances, it was totally understandable, but I remember thinking she should probably ease up on you a little bit.  I doubt that it would have changed anything, though.  Anyway, you said you were going outside to call your roommate.  Well, you said “to make a phone call” and Abby had to drag out of you who you were calling.  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You didn’t tell me until a few days later, because both of you knew about the crush Abby had on me.  After you were outside talking on the phone, you only came back in for about a minute before you went to bed.  It was at that point that I was over the party and was ready to go home.  If you weren’t there, I didn’t really care to hang out any longer.  But I stuck it out for a few more minutes so it wouldn’t be too obvious, and because I didn’t want to hurt Abby’s feelings.  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Side note: as I’m writing this outside the coffee shop Holy Grounds (Catholic University loves its bible puns) in the student center at school, hesitant, and then also all of the things that you make me feel.  What feelings do I have about you?  Well, whatever they are, they’re strong.  Stronger than they should be, I know.  The mix of feelings that make me so drawn to you with the ones that make me so avoidant of Abby at the same time is confusing to say the least.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So you go into Abby’s room to supposedly go to bed (whether or not that’s really what you did, but probably extremely close to whatever it is I did say.  Abby was ready then, and we got up and I said my goodbyes to everyone I met at the party, save you.  I told myself I was going to go knock on the door and give you a hug and say it was nice to finally meet you and then leave.  I was sure I was going to do it.  As I stood up, I even got butterflies because going in to say bye to you made me so nervous.  Actually, it was just interacting with you that made me nervous.  As you already know, I didn’t do that.  I didn’t work up the courage to go in and say goodnight to you.  And I’ve been kicking myself for not going in there ever since.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It’s probably for the best that we weren’t alone together at the end of the night, to kiss you.  Or hug you.  Or see your smile one last time.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I would say that I strongly regret not going into that room to see you before I left that night, enjoyed it, Abby would’ve found out what happened and you would’ve felt guilty.  You told me that if we had kissed then, you probably would’ve tried to kill yourself that night instead of the night after.  I don’t think I could have handled that.  So I’m glad it didn’t happen.  I’m still upset I missed out on a chance to kiss you, though.

I'm usually quiet, if you were to call me ""popular girl,"" you would be wrong but calling me a ""nerd"" wouldn't be right either. I was just sort of there. I had my friends and that's all I needed.

         ""Oh! Did you hear about Daniel? I heard he was sucking cock in the bathroom!"" 
         ""Daniel the fag!""
         ""Daniel should go burn in fucking hell with all the other fags that enjoy buttsex!"" Get the trend here? They kept on saying he was gay, or even writing on bathroom walls, which is very cliche. There have been times where I have asked if he was gay and I would get the same answer every time. 
          ""Do you think I am?"" Over and over, dick-sucker,"" and spreading rumors that I don't even wanna remember. I noticed a change in Daniel, he wasn't as outgoing, didn't speak his mind, became less quite, less proud. I tried helping him, they just attacked him more and more
          That's when I heard the intercom come on one day during class.
       ""Students, has died yesterday."" They didn't tell us how he died, but we all knew. He killed himself. The voice of the principal announcing his death was so fucking emotionless, it made it seem as if Daniel was some character in a movie that died. Everyone was silent. I was filled with anger. Those ruthless bastards did this. They didn't know when to stop. The minute the bell rang, I sprinted to his house asking if it was true was they said today. His father simply nodded and beckoned me in. He said that there was a note left in his room directed to me and ""bitches."" I walked to his room, feeling as if I was going to puke. I found the note, all directed in rainbows, and smiley faces. It made me sick. I opened the note with nervoness and read.
        ""Dear Juno and the son of bitches at school. Let me make this clear. I am not fucking gay. I am as straight as the pole your mom dances on. I should not have to tell people this, you didn't cause this. You are amazing and don't let people do what they did to me to you. I would punch their neck. (:

        What the fuck? That wasn't sad at all. This was the Daniel that I knew. He killed himself because he was done of the shit. I don't think he felt sorry or anything. I don't even know. As I turned to leave, Juno. I am a coward. I wasn't gonna deal with this anymore. They didn't win, remerber that. I won. They get to deal with my death. -Daniel""

We had the top down and were speeding down an old country two-lane road.
 
The prettiest girl in the world was sitting in my passenger seat.

She was laughing. I could never forget that perfect smile.
The orange light from the setting sun caused a glisten in her eyes. I loved the way that I couldn’t keep my focus whenever I was around her.

I managed to break the allure of her hazel-green eyes to check the road.
Nothing.
Just the open road
 
Or so I thought.
 
I don’t know what happened but the car suddenly flipped over.
Everything was silent.
I can’t clearly recall what happened but I remembered that her once-gorgeous golden-brown hair was soiled with blood and that her hazel-green eyes were filled with tears at one point.
But
 
The worst part was that I couldn’t save her.
I reached for her but could never touch her. I called for her but she never answered.
The last thing I saw was that glisten fade from her eyes.
 
I don’t know if I ended up surviving
All I knew was that I had robbed the world of the prettiest girl that it had ever seen.
I could never forgive myself.

That isn’t true.

No

I had a friend once. We’ll call him Jason. Sure, but he outlasted her. She eventually stopped once she realized Jason was starting to actually like the taste.

They were perpetually moist, it was just a Jason thing. When you first got to know Jason you’d politely ignore it but eventually you’d get annoyed and disgusted. Then you learned to ignore it.

Jason wasn’t your average nail-biter, spit out a chewed up keratin remnant on the ground. He told me the habit was disgusting enough, and he didn’t need to ramp it up by spitting nail all over the carpet. So he pocketed them. Each one. He’d chew and gnaw and bite and peel and once he had shaved off just enough of the nail to tear it off, he’d put it in his pocket.

Aside from this admittedly common habit

Your nails grow at an average of 3 millimeters a month. They’re a form of hair, crinkling the minuscule hairs deep inside your nasal cavity. The speed in which they grow all depends on the length of the terminal phalange, so your index finger grows the quickest. In the summer, your nails grow faster. It’s true.

Every young kid has been in a situation where their friend falls asleep first at a sleepover and they don’t know what to do with themselves. On foreign territory, wide awake.

Bored out of my mind and doing anything to keep myself occupied before I got sleepy, unable to see what I was grabbing at now.

Jason wasn’t your average nail-biter. I reached my arm further under the bed and wrapped my fingers around what was surely some sort of glass jar. Still on my stomach with my head turned to the side

I jerk my hand back, the contents of the jar were clear.

An entire jelly jar’s worth of chewed up and spit out, stained purple from scraped out Smucker’s grape jelly. Without a lid, a mass of chewed nail clippings was near dribbling out the exit of the jar, moist with saliva. Pocket lint was scattered throughout the mess. The smell is a thing difficult to describe but for fans of black licorice I’ll spare you the thought.

I look under the bed once more, maybe even five more dark cylinders. More jars. More jars full of nails. I reach under again and touch glass. This jar wasn’t as full as the last. A new collection.

Gagging on the smell and desperate to hide my intrusion I roll both jars back to their original resting place. A wet glob of nails knocked loose by my jostling of the jars just lay on the carpet

The side of my palm now wet from the spit that covered the nail shavings

  Nothing.  
  He did
  ""Oh.""  
  He realized where he was
  As he hobbled down the halls of the nursing home, others watching TV, others still merely sitting and watching their lives fade away. The only thing they had in common were their eyes. Each one shared the same look, the same gaze, one of hopelessness and disgust and confusion.  
  ""Good morning Edward!"" someone called out.  
  He paused, to no one in particular.  
  His name was Francis. 

  When Francis finally reached the kitchen
  Why had he come here?  
  He began to rummage through the various drawers and cabinets.  
  ""What are you looking for
  The voice frightened him. He looked around
  ""Oh
  She smiled a sad sort of smile and left him to his own devices.

  He cried out in pain as the hot glass burned his hand
  ""I'll get that"" said the nurse as she swept up the glass and called for a mop.  
  Francis stood, and confused. He didn't understand.  
  The nurse returned with an insulated styrofoam cup
  ""Oh, as he shuffled out of the room clutching the cup.  
  Her name was Alice. &amp;#32;

  Francis sat on the cold, at another table, a man sat playing chess with himself.  
  ""Francis
  He looked up
  ""Hello Robert!"" He said cheerily.  
  ""Hi Grandpa"" answered Robert
  ""Would you like a coffee?"" Francis asked. ""The nurse poured me one
  ""Sure
  Francis was very pleased. He smiled at Robert for a moment
  Robert paused
  ""Oh."" Francis said. ""Well
  Robert looked rather uncomfortable. ""You mean Grandma?"" 
  ""Ah yes."" Said Francis
  There was a long pause
  ""No, Robert has come to visit.""
  The background chatter hushed
  ""Agnes? Come on honey
  ""Where have you gone? Get over here you old bat!"" Francis stood up, confused and angry, at this, at himself, at everything. 
  Robert still sat on the couch, the spot where his grandfather had once sat was still warm.  
  He was once a brilliant man, and gained the respect of almost everyone he met. He was happy, and others were happy for him. His life was charmed, it seemed.

In her, she dreamed of new discoveries that didn't exist in her world--a world which made her weary. Even now, while sitting on a park bench, contemplating her end, she showed impeccable posture. Try as she might, she simply could not slouch. This was typical Peerless. Even the gun she brought with her was polished to an unearthly sheen. She had only one bullet--after all, she wouldn't need more.

Aiming at her chest and pulling the trigger with her thumb she fired, but she was used to that, sadly. Looking down, the perfect rosette of blood formed on her white blouse, and not a single petal of the red unfolded in a manner unbecoming her legacy of exactitude. She had hoped for irreverent chaos, splatters, or gore. Instead she was a picture-perfect soon-to-be corpse as the blood billowed outward in circles; yet not a drop fell on her skirt.

""Dammit

Then she closed her eyes as if going to sleep and breathed her last. Peerless left nothing out of place for the police and paramedics as they rushed in moments too late. In the end she got what she long desired

1310284056.0,ilh8k,I've been writing a lot of poetry for a while but then I started reading Richard Brautigan and his stuff made me want to try short stories.  Here is my attempt at something weird and relatively short.,gadimus,7,0,1,"I'm an odd memory in most minds.  Like a harrowing communal conscience of migratory birds or a sea breeze that took a train to the prairies and is seen walking along the street.  I suppose I'm a sort of stationary


Let me clarify.


I believe in god about as much as I believe in myself.  If you get to know me you'll find I don't believe in myself that much.  But if you get to know me better you'd know that I've met him.  I'm not saying him in that god is male it's just that calling him *it* seems strange and it's a default.  With that in mind it was a day just like today with me on a stage but I was in the middle of a wheat field and opera singers dressed as vikings were scattered around looking for cues, stood on, read then knocked around by the vikings.


It was at this point that god pulled up in a brand new jeep made out of a thunderstorm and waved his arms in a motion that very distinctly triggered a perhaps unbelievable but entirely real sense that he was god and I should get on his thunderstorm-jeep-of-love to ride away to eternal safety and abundance.  So I hopped up onto the cloud and into the passenger seat.  He looked at me in a way only god could with eyes as deep as artesian wells


""Would you like to take the wheel?"" he asked and I didn't really want to but this was sort of troubling because.... why would anyone turn down an offer from god and he said ""It's alright


I smiled politely.


Then he said ""Alright here's the deal.  You get three questions answered.  Anything in the realm of conceivable knowledge of the infinity that is me.  Three of them.  Just ask whenever and I'll answer but when I answer the last one you will die.""


""What!? Why?"" I blurted out of shock as he looked at me.  I looked right back at those constellations within constellations within a walmart parking lot folded over into itself and back out towards the sunrise.


I smiled realizing the game was ruined and asked ""Are you serious?""


Then he laughed


""You can't screw this up by just asking silly off the top of your mind questions.  Here is my email address.  Send your questions there and I'll have an answer for you written out within a day or two."" god said as plainly as before from inside his thunderstorm with the window rolled down while gesturing blindly in the air to make a point or sign what he was saying but it was entirely lost on me.  He could tell by my glazed look it was time to go so he simply said ""Get a job"" and drove off.


So now.  Slightly but not entirely glazed in circumstance I am struggling with this interaction.  I can know anything in the universe via email at the cost of my life.  I don't really have a desire to acquire knowledge or a need for something like this... so here I am a bag of lemons staring off at the sky like it is staring back in part of that endless crashing gaze of god wondering what the hell I should do with myself.

See, and she was dead. Car accident. Not that the cause is really important. The end result is always the same. And like I said, I never really dealt with this. I was nine. What nine year old can comprehend death? What third grader can grasp the idea that their mother stopped living?  She’s gone, they told me. She’s in heaven. I remember looking up the directions to heaven that night. Why did she go, and not bring me? When is she coming home? Mommy is never coming home, they said. Well, never is a long time. Never hasn’t come and gone yet, I struggled with this concept for a long time. And as a nine year old trying to come to grips with his and everyone else’s mortality


My father tried to help, what was the point? We all live; we all die. It’s a useless cycle of oxygen exchanged with carbon dioxide. Eventually we all become food for trees. Apathy had a stranglehold, and it wasn’t letting go. I tried therapy. They told me I was depressed, so I tried antidepressants. They just made me anxious. I tried writing, but I was never any good. Everything came out stiff. I tried learning an instrument but my fingers never moved the way I wanted them to. Eventually even my father gave up on me. So forgive me if I don’t believe you when you say you care. When your father gives up you, you’re at the bottom. That’s really just it. And what’s sad, what is so fucking pathetic, it’s cliché. I’m just a sad speck in the spectrum of grey nothingness that is the universe. 


And today, that’s for damn sure. So the sun set today, like it has every day in history, and I sat down at my desk. This time I’m not writing for catharsis. I’m not writing to get better. I’m writing so you understand why. And tomorrow the sun is going to rise. Just like today, the day that nothing happened. Just like that day in September when I was nine and my mother was dead.

Agent Martin makes his way back to work after lunch break. His office, shut off by black sliding glass doors. Each office is a command center. 

Martin takes his seat, strikes a few keys on the keyboard, and up pops a panel showing birds-eye footage of a suburban neighbourhood. A large textbox underneath reads “Approaching Destination: 200 meters”. The number steadily decreasing. This damn wind hasn't let up the slightest, he thinks, shaking his head. It had been extremely windy the entire day. Prior to leaving for lunch, he had delployed a set of four drones—as was the standard deployment—packed in a larger camoflauged container-unit—camo-con—which was the source of the footage now on screen. 

The targets name was Wesley Smith. His activities had been flagged with  “Acute Suspicion”  by the system earlier that morning. All such cases required the attention of and if necessary, to his delight, he found that the flag had nothing to do with the users querying history, but rather it's lacktherof. Wesley, it seemed, had found himself some very good encryption software—that the system must be unfamiliar with—as over the past nine hours, his data footprint had been reduced tremendously, flagged the case as “Under Analysis” and had deployed the drone set. The wind however

Now, a tire-swing slowly sways back and forth. It's the swing that flashes in Martin mind; as a kid, he had a friend who lived in a home on that very street. Passing by here, he would often see children pushing each other on that swing. His mind wanders, and he finds himself wondering whether Wesley—No, he must'nt get distracted. The system begins running a series of tests to confirm that this is the correct house, then ejects the four drones from the container

This was probably the most enjoyable part of his job. He begins micromanaging the blade—the smallest, and four millimeters in height. It was a dull shade of grey and perfectly smooth. A barebone unit, it contained just a nano mic-cam component, a communications component, a power supply, and over a dozen micro-motors; it was fairly stealthy, ideal for recon. It's light weight also meant however, and Martin througly enjoyed this challenge. 

After zipping around some for fun, the monitor to Martins left begins blinking. The hound—a relatively clumsly unit that Martin almost hadn't included—had detected illicit substances in it's proximity. A line of bolded text on the monitor reads: SUBSTANCE: [SCHEDULE I - CANNABIS], the last word—CANNABIS—appearing in green font. The change in font color was Martin's little hack to his own station, thus no one else would ever see it. He chucked to himself whenver it came up.

He suddenly dreads including the Hound in the set, even now, the signals sent to the Blade by Martin are first processed by the Tech, and then only passed on if it considers them safe. It is a highly complex unit whose nano-mechanics Martin had always been in awe of, but was not authorized to program. Just to override it's room-inspection algorithm had taken him weeks and numerous demonstrations. But he had done it, and now the three drones would sniff, photograph, in at most three minutes. As the blade

When the inspection completes, working with the Hound had determined that a desk—the laptop sitting on which Martin disappointedly noted was powered off—contains in it's drawer, between three to four grams of marijuana.

All around the Good Soldier were ruins. Not sun-bleached
  
The ruins he now walked among were not like that. These burned-out, rotting on the bones. Smoke drifted from some of the buildings. The streets were empty.

The Good Soldier looked as shoddy as the destroyed buildings around him. His uniform was a disgrace, he couldn’t remember if he had ever had a name.

He had lost his helmet. It made him feel naked
The Good Soldier kept going, for appearances.  He had a long knife on his belt, which was his only real weapon. He met no one as he crept down the street among the ruined buildings.

His throat was dry.  For what may have been the thousandth time that day, was habit, since he wasn’t sweating.

He was thirsty but there was no sign of water anywhere. He didn’t see a market among the buildings that lined the street.  There was no public fountain, he noticed the footprints of dogs, but there were no human or vehicle tracks.

He kept going and walked so far that he realized suddenly that he had reached the outskirts of the ruined town. He walked further onto an open road. He stopped and looked back, he thought.

The road he walked on was gravel and extremely straight and flat.  It led out from the town and onward until it reached the horizon.  There were fields on either side of the road but they were brown and desolate. They weren’t green like fields in East Texas
He followed the road. He was completely vulnerable now, a few distant structures where gunmen might hide.  The town fell further away behind him.  Though he didn’t know why, he had decided to follow the road all the way to the horizon.

Then he spotted a dun-colored cloud in the distance ahead of him.  It was either a dust-devil or a vehicle traveling along the road. He watched with a detached expression as the dust-cloud grew closer.  It seemed to take quite a long time to make its way.  The topography was very flat and the horizon was very far away.  Finally he could make out the truck, the passenger side door, opened. An arm slung over the open door and a helmeted head popped up.  A man stared at the Good Soldier out of dark eyes.

“What are you doing?” the man said.

“Walking. I’m lost”

“You can ride with us if you know the password” the other man said. His face was young and still childishly round but his mouth and eyes were tightened in a harsh expression.

The Good Soldier thought for a moment. He couldn’t remember any passwords. He tried to think back to recent training.  He couldn’t remember anything about passwords. He felt baffled and very lost.

“I don’t know any password

The other soldier stared for a couple of seconds through the waning cloud of dust, the road was quiet again. 
The Good Soldier continued forward along the road. He got thirstier as he went and his boots got heavier.  He saw some dry ditches long the roadside but no water.  Time passed but the undefined sun didn’t seem to change its position in the sky. The heat felt the same on the back of his neck.

The Good Soldier tried to unknow things as he walked. He had learned too much.  ""Thinking themselves wise they have become fools"" was his mother's favorite Bible verse. The Good Soldier had become the biggest fool he could imagine.  He thought about praying, he could pray for his buddies in combat or his friends at home, for himself, for his parents, for world peace. He smiled to himself and the clay mask around his lips was full of cracks. He had prayed too much before, there were no prayers left in him. Praying brought no comfort, only a sickening sensation. He knew how pathetic he was when he prayed.  He was selfish and only thought about himself.  He glanced at his watch.  The numbers had disappeared. The watch was dead. He shook his arm and tapped on the smooth

He kept walking. He remembered how it was back at base. He imagined himself in his bunk. There was a box fan that one of the guys turned on at night.  The sound was mesmerizing.  He loved the vacant

The Good Soldier perceived something ahead of him on the road. It was a figure.  The outlines were blurred by heat waves, the Good Soldier thought.  He kept walking and he didn’t feel nervous.  As the figure approached, the Good Soldier waved to him.  The man waved back and then they were close to each other and their eyes met.   The robed man’s eyes were dark but his complexion was fair. His robe was black and he wore a hood over his gray hair. His long beard now seemed less like a cleric and more like a wizard.  The Good Soldier had read a lot of Harry Potter when he was a kid.

“Hello” the wizard said in a plain American accent.

“Hello. Who are you

“Who are you?” the wizard retorted.

“I don’t know

“It would be far more fortunate if you believed that” the wizard said. His voice was matter of fact. “You’re not lucky enough to be nobody”

“Who are you?” the Good Soldier asked. “Why are you out here by yourself?”

The wizard didn’t answer. “We will walk together” he said and gestured with a long arm for the Good Soldier to proceed forward.  “Talking is best while walking”

The Good soldier didn’t question his new companion any further; he felt somehow that questions were pointless now. They walked along in silence for a good space.  The road was deserted and the horizon hadn’t moved

“Why are your eyes full of despair?” The wizard asked. The Good Soldier glanced over and saw that the man was peering at him closely out of his large

There was a long pause

“Some things happened back there” the Good Soldier said at last

“No justice for your friends

“Where do I put all this injustice?” the Good Soldier was surprised to hear his own voice rise

“You have swallowed the injustice. You will carry it around inside your body forever” The wizard said.

There was a long pause.

“I got an email” The Good Soldier said abruptly

He was looking past the wizard at a place where the sky met the flat earth.  The sky was yellowish-brown

The wizard still peered at him intently

“Biology” the wizard said. ""Only matter

“Yeah

“What will you do without this person?” The wizard asked.

“Suffer”

“What did you do when you had her?”

“I suffered. But it was different; it was suffering with a purpose and a hope at the end and little gaps in the suffering that were full of beauty”

“Now it’s just suffering” the wizard said

“I don’t know. I guess there’s nothing I can do”

“I'm afraid

“Life is meaningless” the Good Soldier said

“If only that were so!” The wizard said, life is utterly meaningful. That is why the injustice aches and festers in your belly.  Some are lucky because they believe life is meaningless, but you know better. The truth has imprisoned you just as truth always imprisons those who find it”

The Good Soldier’s blue eyes lingered on the man’s face. It wasn’t a kind face

“At least life is short”

“Don’t speak nonsense. You know very well that life is long”

“I don’t see how you mean. I’ve seen lives end

“What happens when you die

The Good Soldier thought for a while.  The crunching of their feet on the road was the only sound.

“Well

“And what does one know when one is dead?”

“Nothing”

“Therefore” the wizard’s voice took on an authoritative ring, you will know that you are alive”

“That’s not very good news” the Good Soldier said.

“No. Not to one with a belly full of injustice”

The Good Soldier was quiet for a moment. He wasn’t sure if the wizard was correct.

 “What can I do to stop this feeling?” The Good Soldier said at last.

 “Nothing”

The Good Soldier wiped his forehead

“What about love?” The Good Soldier asked.

“Love is a constellation of traits inherited from others….Love is also the Great Alchemy

The Good Soldier nodded.

“Sadly

“What do I do?”  The Good Soldier said.

“What does a good soldier do?” the wizard asked

He kept walking toward the horizon.

But he was dying. He was alone in the room, but apparently that new heart wasn’t working either and no doctor was able to tell the reason. The heart was beating irregularly, like a disabled man trying to walk. The heart was broken, so they tossed it out.

The man watched the sun go down as he breathed his last breath.



**Three**

The man watched the sun go down as he breathed his last breath.
He woke up and the room was full of light. There was something unrecognizably fluffy under his feet
“Is she here?” he asked. “No
She smiled.

“Don’t be silly” she said. “Home is where your heart is.”



**Four**

“Don’t be silly” she said. “Home is where your heart is.”
He smiled to her
-You sure you can’t stay with this? – He asked
-I haven’t stretched it that much. – She said
-It’s not about that. There’s your perfume all over it.
She blushed and her eyes filled with tears.
-Nah
Which he noticed.
-Yeah

Once she turned her back



**Five**

Once she turned her back
-Please
-Not anymore
-I’ll change.
-You can’t – She turned to him

He would never see her again.



**Six**

He would never see her again
-Do you swear you’ll come back? – She wouldn’t.
-I do
-Do you promise to remember me every day? – She wouldn’t.
-Of course I do. There’s nothing or anyone who can get you outta my head. – There was.
-No French guy? – No.
-No, or American guy or any other kind of guy. – Yes.
-I’ll miss you. – True.
-I’ll miss you too. – True.

She had a nice life in Paris.



**Seven**

She had a nice life in Paris. She had a boyfriend and a dog; she was living with her parents and hanging around with good friends. Nothing could go wrong and she would never get hurt because she couldn’t feel anything.
Till a night a guy came along
But he was broken

He left back to the world

Exhaust

by Reines

	The autumn leaves. They spiral down like ballerinas from their wooden grip and land in the gentle mud. The soft earth embraces the trees fallen sons and daughters and shares with them their blessing. The blessing of not knowing how to feel. They don't know what it's like to wallow endlessly through the caverns of their own minds

                            It's her birthday today.
  
	I stare up at the desert of leaves above me. They stare back. The cool breeze breathes through the forest and carries my exhaled breath with it. I sit up.
	“It's gonna rain, the revolver resting on my lap. “Yep. Gonna rain. I can always tell.” I laugh. “Let's go.”
	Samuel stands up and walks towards me. He rests his head on my shoulder before giving me a huge lick on my cheek
	Standing up, and pet Samuel on the head. He tries to lick my hand.
	“Good boy, the first thing we did after we got married. The second thing we did was break each others' hearts. 
	One year. That's all it took to unveil the carnival of our doubts

                           She left me.

	The brisk wind causes my hair to cackle and wave like fire
	I point the revolver at the dog. 
	“For what it's worth Samuel
	A deep laugh takes the taste of whiskey off of my breath. Samuel stares at me, and then back at me. Deep, he stares, almost unrecognizable. Lost and confused, like when you realize your slimy, arrogant brother's sleeping with your wife. But then his tongue flops out and he smiles.
	“I could never kill you, staring at it like I'm looking at an assortment of stolen memories...echoing out my name. The end of the barrel kisses the bottom my chin. My grip tightens.
	“Life. As cold as the rivers that cascade through my heart.” I smile as Samuel walks towards me. “Ah

They, just be thankful to have a job, or that it is just temporary. You know that isn’t true though. You can’t find a better job because you are working 50 hours a week and you are too tired to do anything else. You can barely even find the energy or will power to get out of bed in the morning. Every once in a while you feel like you have enough energy and fortitude to say enough is enough and move on but then you realize your life revolves around this job. All of your friends are there. They are the people that deal with all of the shitty customers who think they are the Queen of god damn England, the ones who think they own you because you stand behind a register. Your coworkers are the ones that after all the shit you put up with tell to forget the customer, he is an asshole, you didn’t do anything wrong, people like that just happen.

You shower and head to work and start your day off like you have the past, take your slip that shows the time you clocked in and put it your wallet. Then you say high to everyone. Then you either go to the kitchen or the front counter depending on what you are assigned that day. Then you spend the next ten hours slaving away like the robot you are. You listen to the exact same orders, make the exact same food and you have the exact same routine to live by. Then you watch your boss drive up in his new, gas guzzling behemoth of a truck and say “Hi!” to everyone as if he wouldn’t want to be anywhere else in the world. It is as if he has no idea what the people he employs put up with on a daily basis. It is as if he hopes his friendly disposition will be contagious but what does he do besides sit in that office of his in the back while you are the one who gets burned at the fryers and the one who has to choose if it is worth turning the heat on at night. You are the one that has to decide whether or not to fix your car or just walk the five miles or so. The one who should just deal with the tooth ache or dish out the three thousand dollars for a root canal because god forbid giving his employees health insurance would just decimate his profits. No one likes the boss. 

Between the shitty boss, you are less than even the red, blue, and green lights that make up a pixel. You are nonexistent and utterly replaceable and no one will notice if you go. Just like no one has noticed the billions of stars that have existed and perished and no one ever will. Just like no one ever notices the trillions of bacteria that are beneath our feet. That is what you amount to. At some point we have all been there. The thing is though that not all of us end there. That is the saving grace. There is a glimmer of a hope that one day you can escape the cycle of the daily grind. Get a degree if you are young enough, have a support system while you find a better job, or maybe you are stronger than most and do it all alone. 

Not everyone is lucky though. Sometimes the grind wears you down and grinds you to you are so thin that you become a part of the walls there. You are an everlasting stone that will be a part of where you are stuck, then you better get used to meaningless, mindless tasks that ask nothing of you but obedience.  The boss, the haves, will tell you that working at these crummy soul devouring jobs is fine. What would they know about what you do though? It is not a matter of them being any less hard working but it is a matter of having something to show for it. If you work at a restaurant and you can’t even afford to eat there they pay you so little then what is the point? 

It gets to the point where thinking physically hurts. It breaks you just as bad as your job does. You think of all the things that you gave up, then the filet, and then the top part of the bun. You have wrapped the sandwich and placed it in the warming drawer until you throw it up for the next customer to devour or for it to get thrown away because it has been the warmer to long and has grown hard and unpleasant and unwanted.

1363916462.0,1arum7,The Glowing,Dream_is_destiny,6,1,4,"Hello all, so it's a rough draft.


“Alright
“See ya, the bartender, and reciprocated the bro-man-shake. 
Jason waved casually and called out a brief salutation to a couple at the end of the bar who were engaged in a giggle-rich conversation.

Jason knew the bartender from back in his community college days, damp night and began the three-block strut home. Some quick movement caught his peripheral, but he paid no serious mind. It was probably some animal raiding the garages from the restaurants. The ones where people wasted half of their food because they were too rich to care about economics and wastefulness, and their appearances took precedence. Hmph, “high society,” to Wyatt, was simply a lack of common sense where narcissism took the place of thought processes. 

He passed a good-looking couple that looked healthy, a little scruffy, a gate that adjusted to the clear burdens he carried throughout life, a gaze that seemed to look right through you, to see your true nature. 

Another brief movement caught his eye, shirt, and pants from his body. Surrendering the day to the night, he tumbled into bed and hastily threw his blanket over himself, already on the brink of snores. Right before his consciousness left him, he heard a barely audible voice… “Are you ready, Wyatt?”

He yawned and slapped both hands over his face and stretched his way out of bed. Time to get up and weld some shit. He didn’t like showering before work, and put on some shitty, worn out clothes. He took notice of the nice sunny clear sky and retorted with a grin. Today seemed like a breakfast burrito and coffee day. He moseyed his way out the door. Wyatt then stopped short. Even his breath stopped. Everything around him was the same – same shops, same clear blue sky, same cars and streets. But the people… The peoples’ faces were all glowing. They all glowed in different colors and different intensities. But they ALL glowed. He just then realized in his half-asleep construction of the day, he never looked in the mirror. Wyatt whipped around and inspected his own reflection in the glass. Sure enough, his own face was glowing an intense yellow. His first thought went to the possibility of a hallucinogen. He felt fine before he went to sleep. And this theory wasn’t really viable, unlike the total world-altering effects of a hallucinogen. Was he going crazy? No family history of schizophrenia that he knew of. He stood panicking, questioning the validity of his reality. He stood up slowly as if laboring to move through a pit of tar. That’s what this was

“Yep, if it was going to be this way, he needed to get IN it, see what this is all about. If this WAS some sort of other dimension, maybe he would have a really amazing job, and maybe the beer was better and the women were looser. Probably not, but there was no harm in hope. He descended the stairs to step back into the day to face the faces. They all glowed, and all in a wide variety of colors – some putrid in hue with a heavy glow

He saw groups lunching outside and took note that many of the groups shared similar styles of light and intensity of color. Not all of them however, just one person seemed to drain the others of their light, and all of them smiling less, the jovial nature decreasing as the glowing distributed itself to the one or two in the group. It was as if they didn’t want to give the light, and the person didn’t wish to receive it. Like being sapped for energy, then the energy becomes poison for the receiver. 

Jason decided that if this was going to happen, he wanted to visit his father. His father drove truck, and 14 months prior had been in a bad semi accident, rendering him comatose. Jason liked to go visit his dad and imagined he could hear what Jason was saying, and tried to imagine him responding in some sort of telekinesis style of communication. It felt like it kept his heart strong to imagine his father, even while lying comatose, participating in some sort of active communication. He hopped onto the downtown bus that circled around downtown and ended at the second largest hospital in the city. 

He entered the rotating doors and immediately noted that the patients in their rooms, less brightly colored jellies. The elderly and the more apparently sick peoples’ glows were comparably slower than the children’s and the less severely injured patients’. It felt slightly comforting for him to find a pattern among the madness of the situation. 
Jason took notice of all the lights and flows and colors, from every nick in the wall to stain on the carpet and even some of the faces of the orderlies and staff that would frequent this particular path. On this particular day, however, he could see everyone in a little bit of a different light. The lights that emanated from the staff seemed to have a consistent glow, but it wasn’t exactly bright. It was duller, and faint. The visitors all varied in color and intensity, while in each of the rooms the lights from their faces took on varying colors but were all immensely faded

He stood outside of his father’s room a moment, but not as faded as he had feared. It was deep and purple, but bright enough not give Jason concern. He pulled his usual chair up to the side of the bed.

“Hi dad, and everything was a little different. I don’t know if I’m going mad, or there’s something seriously wrong with me, or if it’s just something wrong with the rest of the world. Hell, it might even not be anything wrong with me or the world, maybe it’s just… changed… But dad, I can see everyone. Like, it’s more like, if they’re ok or not, good. I have to admit I was scared to come in here

Jason sat for a moment of reflection and relief that his father really was still there, that he could also hear. Then began to go on about sports, his trip with Greg, and a few women – the normal things he would go in with. Then he leaned over and kissed his father’s head and gave his goodbyes before he ventured back out into the new world. 

He decided to go about his day as normal, as unhealthy for the soul as sickness must have been for the body. He walked down to the bar, and was happy to see that his friend was indeed working. Something concerned him, however. His friend also had a glow, and the glow was a sickly, dull, yellow color, he wouldn’t say anything. He wasn’t the type of man to worry about it. Still

He headed to the park for some serenity. He noticed some couples picnicking in the grass, and some children simply playing in nature. They all had something in common, their glowing auras were all very strong and colorful. Their smiles at one another even intensified their glory. When the people first came into the park, they had similar differences as the folks that meandered around the streets. However, as they allowed themselves to bond more and more with nature, they began to change into stronger, brighter souls – that couldn’t help but to shine in the way they were intended. 

He decided that maybe this was the way it was going to be forever, and there was really nothing he could do about it. He did know, however, that he felt exhaustion. He began his route home, taking notice of all the different glows of the people, and what that meant for their inner state. Some were at peace, some were drained, overworked, if he decided to use it in that way

He turned the corner and passed down an alley, there grew a great and white glow. It was a glow with such intensity that actually produced a sound. He felt it warning him to stay away from it. It didn’t seem to want to be approached, but instead wanted to be the one to come to him. The source was so unknown, and if it didn’t want to be bothered, there was no telling what would occur. So he turned back away from the alley and went home. It was unnatural to disturb whatever lurked behind that dumpster. 

He walked along his way home and went back to bed. As he slowly fell asleep he thought he heard a voice in the distance. “You see, you’ve just been so blind. Now you can see, and now you must do.” And he fell asleep until the morrow.

I wasn't totally motivated to keep writing but I've since gotten a job and any second I have free I write. Now for the **[WARNING]** bit

A stone cell

Each stone in the wall had more age and life than I could comprehend, like each note to a score. My wrists hurt from the shackles bound to them, their embrace neither tight nore loose. The pressense enough to remove any will to break the binds, or even to perppetuate an imagination capable of the thought to escape. 

The air so thick from a rippled blanket of decay, regardless of how long my stay is to be, I was dead long before my last breathe. 

My mind still in its endless walts at intances takes certain pauses, I always have the same inquarie, forever wondering why had this not happened sooner? Had my life been ended early, the temptation of a return would be weaker, the husk left behind stronger enough to face its abysmal excistance.

Mercy be it too sacred of word to pass these pale lips

As I would ask the same given the placement of your eyes

The year of our lord where I resided, one could not see difference between my brethren and the bloated rats that plagued the streets.

Do not attempt sympathy, as I've seen my same wrong doings in the eyes of others. 

We all have our vices, my body moonlit to another, a beast of sin and flesh.

While I knew the crime being committed, her tears no less salty, and her blood showed no sign of any more imperfection compared to even my own. Her flesh bore little resistance to teeth, as is the same for the rest.

Once I awoke from my lustful haze, each one from each potential full life lived who crossed my gaze. My favorite was a set of pearls as I had taken a foster role for a time with this child, they enjoyed walking the shores and these pearls were a present from them.

My method of disposal is simplistic while just as vile as the first act, as for the head however there a problem arises. My method of habit is to sever the cheeks, nose, and ears as they are still succulent; with the rest I make a contribution to the gullets of the wild including their clothes. Children were always told to stay away from the forest, such tales humane compared to my own sins.

After the clean up for this child, while I knew nothing regarding politics of this country, I was very aware I was staring at the crest of the king.  

I sat ever so still, the child of royalty was dead and my hands more so than ever were stained. 
I knew I had to attempt something

The forrest reserved no strength against me, however nothing of this intensity. 

""He's here!"" ""Burn the demon!"" ""Kill him

The voices fell to whispers and quieter still as I reached my planned resting grounds. I marked these grounds by a rusted spade set to a rotted stump
After hours of toiling finding a suitable place for the remains

As the last bit of cloth was placed I filled my lungs for what felt as new a experience, my mind with such unrest. As my heart began to slow I heard a voice, to my dismay it was not of my own corrupted design.

""Damn fucking snakes

To what ends will I be tested this day I thought

I took towards the voice careful not to be revealed, 
dressed in fatigues of a royal guard. I sat still for moment to calculate my next action, unless hunting the wicked. 

I know what needed to be done to rid myself of this trial

Regret? Maybe. The consequences were expected but were not planned for, the ability to extend the extent to which one can truly be empathetic towards another person. You see many people say they have felt all alone in the world, that they have felt isolated from the rest of humanity, but in truth their claims are lies. For many of them the feeling of loneliness was an exaggeration of their feelings. There would most likely be someone there for them be them parents, partners friends or mere acquaintances. In order to feel truly lonely all human relations, all ties to the world must be removed. In order to remove friends I simply stopped seeing them. I skipped school, didn’t attend their parties until they all forgot about me. Children are like that. To remove my parents something more drastic had to be done. My parents couldn’t be made to forget my existence and I could not run away since I would not be able to survive. In order to achieve a higher degree of understanding I had to remove my parents without changed my own situation. Of course, no one to rely on or look up to. There was just me and the absence of everyone else. I was like that until you found me, who knows,

Then it happened. As I was deep in thought
When I woke up I was in St. Jimmy's National Hospital. I as I came to I heard this voice in my head,"" Good mourning John!"" Her smile probably cured a case of cancer at one point. I know it stopped my headache. 

After a bit of routine vital signs check, my parent, and THAT other person, and motioned for them to talk with him. Being the eavesdropper I am, I listened closely. 
""Mr. and Ms. Suburbia, deep limbic system and his temporal lobes. These are the parts of the brain that essentially control our emotions,"" the doctor said sternly. ""I'm sorry to say this; but your son now has a multipersonality disorder. We have had cases like this in the past and we call it Saint Jimmy's disorder."" The doctor's voice began to crack. ""Your son is expected to live for 1 year.""


The voice in my head begins to take control of me. It tells me this, alone in the world. Then the doctor cleared his throat and spoke. ""It seems John's disorder disappears when Maria is around him,"" He said with a smile. ""I think we will start the therapy with Maria accompanying John."" He turned his glance at me and said,""There maybe hope for you yet, John.""

After that ordeal was over and done with,"" How about you come with me to work tonight, John?"", she said with mischievous smile. She saw the worried look on my face and said,""Don't worry it's not like we are going to get caught."" I thought to myself, she's a rebel all right. Later that evening she appeared outside my door. She was the definition of an angel. She was wearing a pair of skinny jeans with a men's black button-up shirt with a red tie on it. Her hair was in a pony tail and on her lips was the reddest lip stick I've ever seen. Her top two buttons on her shirt were unbuttoned so I could see a bit of hear cleavage. She teasing me, I thought. Jimmy had something to say too. ""It's not going to work John. She's not your kind of girl."" I fire back at Jimmy,""Look Jesus
dating... Ms. Whatsername out there. But your no rebel

 Jesus says to me,"" D-DUDE! That door has an alarm on it!"" I disregarded his warning and burst through the door carrying Whatsername in my arms. Then the bell sounded. The sprinklers came on and tried to put out a fire that didn't exist. I could hear the people screaming from the water getting soaked. I laughed to myself as I ran. I ran to my home and never looked back. I layed Whatsername on the couch. She said as her eyes closed,""Best 20 minute date I've ever had."" I buttoned her shirt back up and sort of just drooped down to the floor and passed out. I could tell Jesus was impressed. Maybe even jealous.

 I woke up with the biggest headache ever, Jimmy had gone to sleep for today, he told me in my dreams. I was in control for today. I saw her get up, stretch and let out a big yawn. She rubbed her eyes and then her neck, probably from bunking on the couch all night. She looked really hungover. I said smoothly,"" Good mourning, sleepyhead."" ""Mourning Jimmy, he bellowed. ""SHE'S YOUR NURSE NOT YOUR GIRLFRIEND!!!!"" I called for St. Jimmy in my head to help me but he told me sort it out myself. I took a deep gasp of air and while he was still babbling, your not even my dad. You just married my mom that I love,""That was me

He wondered aimlessly. He didn’t think. Thinking took too much effort and the thoughts it created were not worth venturing down quite yet. He just walked because that was all he could do. His phone was in his pocket and he endured the cold while he waited for it to ring. The breeze ran down the street and bit and tore until it bit into his skin. He was not walking to anywhere in particular or for any other reason than to stall. The streets were deserted and the park by the lake contained nothing but the geese lagging behind on their journey south. 
	
His mind trailed off. Where could she be? What could she be doing? When was the last time I saw? Does she even want to see me? Am I simply just wasting my time? No, don’t let your mind wonder off. Thinking hurts too much. She cannot just be gone without a goodbye or a mere fare thee well. 
	
Nine p.m. he said. We will go to the movies, no missed calls, not anything. He put it away and stared at the light on the other side of the lake. He wrapped his hands around himself and stuck them under his arms to stay warm and waited for a call.
	
Ten-forty-five. At ten-forty-five it finally arrives. The phone rings and he answers. Contempt, and longing coursed through him. He doesn’t speak immediately. Control is important, nothing good comes from impulse. “Hello my dear. Is it as I fear? Will I still see you here?”
	
“No my love, like loons, but don’t be mad, I will be beside you soon.” 
	
A consolation time, and never mine, but yours to spend. I just thought it was on you that I could depend.”
	
He let the cold slip in further. His ears went numb, and hugged around him when he sat down. Eleven o’clock his phone said now. Better late than never he thought. Then twelve came around. Then one, and then finally his eyes fell shut and he gave up. 
	
He woke up with hands running through his hair. Cold hands. He looked up and saw her. The smile crept across their faces as the stared. “Hello my love
	
“Because here dear, but never darker” 
	
“But my love you must explain. Why am I in so much pain? Why must you always delay?  I have love for you that cannot be swayed
	
And one day soon. That will happen for you. Though it may hurt
	
And then she was gone. He felt his head. It was still cold. He checked his phone and saw no calls. No messages. Nothing at all. Nothing at all to ease his mind. So he lay there

Hoping to find some much needed supplies, and the great mountains beyond them. A sign, eroded by age, read in large white letters “Welcome to Denver.” He heard of the place before. They used to call it the “mile high city,” but that was long ago. Back when he had friends.

He had been the first male born to his tribe, and the towers became empty. They told him of sky people, who had come down to the earth and snatched its inhabitants. But in defiance, they fought back and were swiftly annihilated. Seeing their potential slaves mostly dead, the sky people fled, and left them to their ruined home. 

His tribe were his friends. But his friends had sent him out here

So now there were no friends. It had been a long time since he had heard the sound of another voice. His own often provided that helpful second opinion. He liked his voice

 Thinking of these things made the trip seem shorter, nothing worth collecting. He kept on, his spear held tightly in his hand. Who knew what monster may inhabit these crypts? The place was deathly quiet; the only sound was the slight rustle of the wind upon the grass. But his ears perked up as a piece of rubble fell out of place.

Stopping, and quickly whipped out his pistol. Taking aim as the figure approached, he discharged a bullet. But in the mere sliver of time before he pulled the trigger, he saw the figure’s face. It was a woman, a beautiful woman, not scarred by the brutal reality of this hostile wasteland. He could not cut down such beauty; his heart would not allow him, even for survival. His hand moved the slightest inch out of line as he fired, striking nothing.

She fired back, the man slowly bent down on one knee, and then another. He grasped at his chest, and began to breathe raggedly. He could feel his heart hurting. As he fell backwards to the ground, tears began to form in his eyes. As the darkness began to surround him, he felt not fear, but joy. He wished the woman a farewell in his mind, the man looked up at the great towering tombstones

1348866354.0,10mzqx,The cheese maker's wife.  ,POLLYWANTITALL,6,0,0,"There's a little neglected drag of cobble half a mile up from the banks of Possible's stream

Horny lads, cluck, as they sauntered sheepishly in the evening, searching for a lass to loosen their wallets for.  The new age saunterers in their barely worn pea-coats, pry grimaces from the cheese maker.  The sound of flats and flimsy conversation bouncing off the old street and into the cheese maker's ears.  He hated them.  

The cheese maker had lived alone since his wife had died 8 years ago.  I would see him now and then as he stopped in the diner I worked at and had a cup of coffee.  Nobody really knew his name.  Nobody really cared enough to inquire.  His presence seemed to go unnoticed as he strolled through town.  Maybe he likes it that way.  

I called him the cheese maker because that had been his profession.  He owned a small farm outside of town that he had purchased after returning home from WWII.  His sons ran the farm now and they routinely delivered the cheese and milk we used in the diner.  They had booted their father out into a nursing home.  I learned all of this because they would engage in small talk with my manager who was an old childhood friend of theirs.  

I can't tell you exactly why I had become so infatuated with his life story.  I would get off work and walk past his nursing home.  Sometimes I would see him out and about

It's been a few weeks since I last seen him

It was the cheese maker and another elderly man yelling back and forth at each over the white picket fence built around the nursing home.  ""You filthy fucking rat!"" stammered the cheese maker.  ""Don't call me a rat, if I hadn't thrown my ring into that goddamn stream!"" yelled chester in fury.  

""I go to her grave every morning.  And you, FUCK YOU, you sniveling little fuck.""  The cheese maker picked up a rock from the ground and hurled it at chester.  The rock missed chester and landed in the street behind him.  By this time, the care taker's had come out and were ushering the cheese maker, who was mumbling curses, back to the house.  

Chester inched his way down the sidewalk past me.  He had a cane in his left hand and leaned half his body on it as he walked.  He didn't see me and I passed him and went home.  I was so fascinated.  The two men

A few weeks had passed since their last quarrel.  I couldn't pacify my intrigue.  The sullen moments at work and the blandness of the regular social interactions between people left me craving their passion

Then one day he appeared.  The cheese maker himself.  He waddled into the diner and sat in his regular spot and ordered a black coffee with two sugars.  I brought it out to him.  He didn't look at me.  He stared straight out the window

Chester had died that day.  I read it in the obituary later that night.  He had a bad heart they said.  I thought this was ironic.  I went to the burial.  I stood in the back away from everyone else.  I took a cigarette out and puffed on it.  I looked over to my left and noticed the cheese maker walk up beside me.  ""You got another one of those?"" he asked motioning towards my pocket.  ""Yeah

	 My grandma has always said that she loves New York, and other forms of art. Married at 18, and having a child soon thereafter, she never got to experience the things that could bring her as much joy as her family. I will always wonder if she lived without regret.
	I looked down at her hand – discolored, as well as my own, I stand here now with more opportunity than she received in all of her years combined. I will always wonder if she lived without regret. 
	“But, even then. She let out one of her light laughs that just roll their way out into the space of your ears. It’s comforting to feel that from her. We all gave a slight chuckle, but we knew that it would not get better.  It had been said many times just that day that we’ll have to sacrifice her quality of life for it to be sustained. 
	Going to visit her was one of the most powerful and important times in my life. I learned firsthand the circle of life. When you’re there and you know that the days your loved has left are vastly outnumbered by that he or she has lived
It’s just life and that’s all it will ever be – from birth to death.  It’s all we, but know that there is always a now.  There will be a time to say goodbye to everyone you’ve ever met. Take it, and be grateful.

Was sticky a smell? Aaron entertained that thought long enough to admit that it was, he quietly unlocked the door, grasping the smooth metal handle carefully as he did. Trying to sneak in on Bruce was always impossible, but he always tried anyways.
 
He opened his door to find his roommate waiting for him. Aaron smiled, wearing his typical bored expression, simply shook his head and sat back down on the couch to resume his game. Aaron also shook his head, still grinning, as he walked into his room. Dropping his backpack with college books with a muffled thump, he plopped down on his soft bed. He could already feel the energy draining from his body. It had something to do with the bed, he figured. In another minute he would be too tired to get up for anything.
 
“Amanda came over, the reason he had almost taken up dancing. Amanda with the great legs.
 
The legs were worth mentioning twice.
 
“What did she say?” he asked
 
“If you are so excited
 
“What makes you think I’m excited?”
 
Bruce looked up at him for a moment. “Maybe the fact that you practically teleported from your bed to the couch when I mentioned her name.”
 
Damn.
 
Aaron leaned back onto the couch and let out a sigh. “Is it that obvious?”
 
“Only to people with eyes.”
 
Aaron rolled his eyes. “So what did she want?” He asked once more
 
“Something about wanting ‘to see the world’.”
 
“... And?”
 
Bruce looked at his friend once more. “You don’t actually think I was paying attention to her words
 
""You're an ass.""

""I know.""
 
“Did you at least get your eyes off of her body long enough to know where she is right now?”
 
Bruce thought for a moment. “I believe she was heading back to her room. That would be the first place I would check for her.”	Aaron was almost out the door by the time his friend finished talking.
 
Taking the hallway down to the elevator,” he mumbled, his palm on his forehead, as he tried to regain some composure. “She just wants to talk, maybe she saw your game last week. Or needs help with the writing assignment.”  He paused for a moment. “Yeah, she doesn’t need your help.”
 
When the elevator doors opened
 
He knocked on the door, it opened.	She was wearing volleyball shorts. At this moment, Aaron was very thankful he was wearing the sunglasses. Her long, blond hair ran just to the middle of her back, and was complimented by her beautiful blue eyes. Her whole figure was, well, amazing; not a toothpick, curvy. Even her nose was attractive
 
Shit
 
“... said that you were out.” she finished, looking like a model. Aaron stopped himself before going into another embarrassing lapse of attention.
 
“Yeah
 
“Actually
 
“Yeah
 
“Thanks
 
“Yeah, or something?”
 
Amanda stared at him for a moment, still smiling.
 
He was gonna kill Bruce.
 
“You know what, a study date with Amanda, sort of. This day just got about a million times better.
 
Now all he had to do was find a way to hid Bruce’s body

He stood in the blackness, fleeting tone that slipped through the night like the soft cries of a cornered prey. But it was with that sole musicless tone that he fought the night. It was like a dirge to him, a requim to be repeated over and over lest a chaotic fate take his life, some form of protection. The night carried dangers, of course. The night always carried danger, slow predators, fast prey, pressed by others who would take their life for sustenance, their children



These were not the questions that He pondered as his tones and scales passed into the night. The question he pondered was a simple one. Does the night threaten, like a hammer to be weilded against the nails of the world? Humans were so good with tools. They used their world and changed their world and were positively okay with changing with their own alterations. Each new hell we press upon the world is one  which we will pay for. We are punished by our sins, not for them. 



The tone changed. The man's face twitched, he had no chance of escape. By the time the news had reported the scientist's findings, the blast radius covered his entire nation. No vehicle could bear him from the damage now. He and his family would be lost, his home burned beyond even molecular recognition, with a force like an atomic bomb striking so close. He would be lost. But life would not be. The meteor was a predator, a cosmic wolf with gnashing teeth and cracked claws. But prey could be clever. Humans were so good with tools. 



Inside a small black box buried feet under the ground lay a seed. A small seed, the little black box designed to handle even the force of an atomic bomb. It found its way out. Through the ashey dirt it fled, past the atoms of He and his family and their home and the ashphalt and chaos of humanity. Past humanity it fled, reaching towards light, unsure if the earth above it would bury it. But humans were so good with tools. A sharp metal stab rang out near the plants' new growth. It could feel the earth above it rended, torn from its roots and sent flying into the air. But its roots were strong, buried in humanity. The rending stopped. Above the plant, a white shining mass of hydrocarbons and polycarbonates. It was a human


Later, it said; “Humanity does not refer to human beings' selfish nature for self preservation. It refers to the quality within us which protects all life, both ours and others.”",,False,,t5_2qhmi,,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/zsstd/please_judge_this_rough_draft_i_would_like_to/

   A woman walked up to the counter in front of me.  Her stomach pushed tighter against her gray sweatshirt than her breasts

   She reached out her bloated hands.  The double-double with extra crispy fries sat there steaming. 

   *Fuck

   She was about to grab hold of the tray, and vanilla milkshake were incinerated.  Little heaps of ashen coal now smoldered in front of her. 

   “*No*!”  She turned away dejected

   I turned to my fellow cashier. 

   “Paul.  I’m gonna take a lunch break.  You want to come?”

   “Yeah

   “Good.  So, where you can ‘have it your way,’ so long as your way is charcoaled.”

   “I don’t care.  Let’s just grab something from here and sit outside.”

   We forked two sizzling patties off the stainless steel grill and slapped them on the buns that lay open on our plates.  I followed Paul out of the shop to one of the stark white tables.   We sat underneath its red and yellow umbrella

   *What they would give for just one bite.*  I clamped my teeth down around the bun and a collective groan issued from the mass.  The first time I’d heard it I nearly jumped out of my seat.  Now it’s just part of the job.

   I swallowed my first bite.  “Hey

   “What?”

   “Just sitting out here

   “Hey

   “What can you do?  I see these people shuffle in line for hours upon hours.  They finally get their turn to taste what got them here in the first place.  The meal of their dreams sits there on a platter

   I was almost finished with my burger. “And for what?  Because they had one, they have to wait in line until their bodies have eaten away the excess fat so that they meet Heaven’s standards?  It just seems kind of…sadistic.”

You see

Think.

Think back to the last time we spoke. Do you remember? I was once like you, had a job and a family, and friends and a dog that yelped excitedly every night when I came home. Can you see it now? Does my face look familiar?

You don't even stop to look me in the eyes as you drop a penny or two into my outstretched hands. No wonder you don't recognise me. You move on quickly lest I begin to pester you for more change; lest I inquire why a man such as you leaves me only a few pennies when you could obviously spare much more. 

I, and how the polished leather shoes enhance the illusion. Now my shoes are torn and tattered, dirty and battered. And you know what? That doesn't make me any less of a person.

So why won't you look at me?

Tell me

Why won't you recognise me?

Do you still have the picture we took, and me it gave a dirty old boot. Unlucky, I guess.

Now the only fishing I do is in old trashcans.

I live with the night, that is one thing I am thankful for. You're still stuck in your endless cycles.

Wake up, go to sleep. Repeat. Over and over, day in and day out.

I met a peculiar man today. A man, thick hair, a man much like the rest. A crooked smile here, a calloused hand there, just like any other man. But this man seemed particularly peculiar in my mind.
 
Maybe it was because he decided to talk to me.
 
I was sitting on my bench, it was practically ritual, that I come down here, drop bread crumbs for the birds, and stare off into the dark green and  brown made up by the cool grass and the tall trees. I have done it for quite some time now. Some days it's harder to make it down to my bench than others. But it's really all that I have, my bench, the birds, the moments there in time.
 
And it was on this day, head down, direct, like most that walk past me. But after he had made it a few steps past me and my bench, he stopped, and spun on his heel, like someone was using him as a top, at least six feet, wondering why the man had stopped so suddenly. He finally opened his mouth
 
It took me a moment to react before I found the words to answer him,"" I answered, ""let me check my watch."" I reached into my bag and pulled out of all the clutter a pocket watch, the one I always carry. I opened it, and saw what I easily knew was an incorrect time. I held it up to my ear, and heard not a sound from inside the watch, nothing echoing between its many gears. ""Oh lord, I'm afraid it's not kept the time sir
 
""Oh it's alright Ma'am, it is a fine looking pocket watch Ma'am, reminds me of one that belongs to my father.""
 
""Well I'm sure his probably kept time
 
The man chuckles a bit too. ""May I ask then why you keep it on your person
 
I look at the man and smile. ""It's my husband’s actually, and he obliges. He put his hand forth, and shakes my outstretched hand. ""I'm Howard,"" he says with a grin; ""I'm Alice,"" I replied.
 
""Well I am pleased to meet you Alice."" I handed him a chunk of bread, an old lady who feeds the birds. Not a very glamorous way to spend the afternoon for a man such as this at his age. ""Were you going anywhere important just now?"" I inquired.
 
I seemed to rouse him from deep thought. ""Hmm? Oh no,"" he replied and his head turned back down towards the birds, a certain light gone from the once innocent looking man. ""Is there something on your mind young man?"" I pressed.
 
He exhales deeply,"" he answered. ""I just got the notice this morning. Making sure to pick up milk on my way home for the wife seems a little more insignificant with that perspective."" He leaned back against the bench, brought a hand to his perspiring head. He sees me looking at him through his hand, and tries to compose himself; ""Not that I'm scared or nothing!"" he stated with a bravado that only rung half-true. ""Just a bit nervous is all.""
 
""That's nothing to be ashamed of young man. War is a place filled with frightful things. Why, so he fought."" I look down at my cool, calloused hands in the morning light. ""He seems like a good man,"" the young man replies with a small smile.
 
A smile breaks across my face,"" I replied. The smile starts to fade as I look up towards the sky, and then back down at my hands. ""Oh god, how I loved that man,” I said in a soft whisper.
 
Howard put a comforting hand on my shoulder, ""is your husband passed? Did he die in the war?""
 
I can't bear to look up at the moment,"" I had trouble getting the words out, ""my husband did not come back the same. He was plagued by nightmares, terrors of the horrible things he had seen while fighting. It drove him to drink, it drove him mad, and it drove him to forget about…"" I start to stammer as my fingers run over a dark scar hidden under my sleeve. ""He forgot about how we used to be. The combination of it all proved too much for both him and me. My husband is now passed away, to answer your question."" And the true answer, is yes! Yes, only an empty shell of a man for which there was only room for sadness and sorrow. My husband went to war
 
The man next to me, but whether it was because he didn't know how to react to such a story, or if he feared that a similar fate would befall him and his situation, I did not know. After what seemed like over a minute, the man spoke up. ""I'm sorry to hear what happened to your husband, ma'am.""
 
""Thank you, as I looked up at Howard and saw what seemed to be a familiar kindness in his eyes, something I haven't been privileged to in years. I grab a hold of the hand he was resting on the bench. I fight back tears as I arrange the words I want to say. ""You have no need to worry though Howard. You will make it through that war, I know it. You will make it home to see your family."" 
 
""I appreciate you saying that, and we both laughed, breaking some of the tension. Howard stood up, and donned the grey hat he had taken off. ""Well, I better get going; I still have to pick up that milk before heading home."" He stood there awkwardly, as we didn't know what to say. ""Thanks for the talk Alice; it means a lot, even to a guy like me."" He cracked that crooked smile of his. I smiled back at him, Howard
 
He smiled again, in top-like fashion. ""What is it, Alice?""
 
I had trouble getting the words out. ""Please, his eyes showing a pain that hadn't been there, even moments before.
 
""I will
 
And off he walked, but never forgotten date blew past my bench, and became nothingness.

“What can I do for you

“I’d like to redeem my gold star

When his cock was covered in my saliva, I slid him all the way into my mouth, letting my tongue play with the underside of his cock as he was thrusting in and out. My hands went to his balls, massaging them and rubbing his taint while he was thrusting and moaning. His hands were bunched in my hair, so I sucked harder. He shot his load into my mouth and it slid down my throat. I swallowed it all, “Did that earn me enough gold stars?”

“Oh God

He pushed me over his desk, pushed my skirt up, and thrust into me hard. I moaned so loud I was sure someone would hear me. He thrust into me harder, holding my waist to keep me steady. It only took five more thrusts and I was gone. I came so hard that I shivered. He came again seconds later. I lay breathing hard on his desk for a few seconds, trying to catch my breath. When I got up, he looked at me and whispered with a smile on his face, “Good job. One gold star.” 

I put my shirt back on, opened his office door, and walked out with his cum running down my legs. As I passed the student aid, she openly stared at me, so I knew that she had heard at least part of what happened in there. I put my finger up to my mouth to tell her to keep quiet and walked out of the building. I can’t wait to earn some more gold stars.

I’m grabbing a glass jar and tossing one to my younger sister now. Her and I now dash down the few steps of our porch and step onto our playing field. I can see them all, never satisfied with their place on the canvas.

But this wonder is nothing new to my sister and I. We have done this as far as my memory will stretch. We’re dashing off in different directions now, I can begin my work.

A particularly gleaming bug is drifting past my eyes right now. I’m going to turn my jar to the side, exploring his new home, I’m sure. I can’t think of a name for him quite yet, but there will be time for formalities later. Right now I need to continue the hunt.

Bending down now I scoop up a bug at my feet. I’m feeling the minuscule legs of the thing tickle my palm now. I’m assessing my catch. This one is too small. It simply will not do. It needs to grow and mature before I could even consider capturing this luminous soul. I’m going to let it go. I open my palm and it flits away from me

My baby sister and I are darting across our lawn, enthralled in the beauty and wonderment of the scene.

“Hey

It hasn’t been long but our game is over now. We’re saying good night to the fireflies now and sprinting back up to our wood deck,’ I’ve already begun staring at my jar, full of little lightning bugs. It’s glowing bright, my suburban lantern.

My usual request to bring the jar inside has been denied again, Fireman, Lightdude, Ember, Doug, Nick, and Eric. *I’m going to say good night to you now

Morning is here now and I’m running outside to check on my prized jar. Only one of my fireflies is alive now. He’s slowly crawling across the bottom of the glass, sisters, aunts. His belly is smoldering ever so dimly now, barely casting a light in this hot morning sun. I don’t think they liked the grass I gave them, either.

If you are light-hearted or sensitive to such material then please do not read this. If however you do read it then please read it till the end. This story is meant to portray a fraction of the possible cruelties which the people of Syria might be facing. 
 
DAMSEL IN DISTRESS
 
The bullets whizzed past. People were getting gunned. Debris was clouding everything. The storm of blood
 
The militants of the regime kept the civilians pegged down in their base. It was a bottleneck situation. Only one-way out
 
The people were pushed back either into their houses or whatever cover they could find from the constant blasts and bullets.
 
Bodies lay in piles down the street and the smell of blood and gun powder staunched the air. One was forced to only two sounds
 
Hisham was one of the gunmen. Thirty four killed today, was on forty seven. He just had to beat him. HE HAD TOO !!!
 
He remained behind cover while reloading his rifle. The anxiety was building up in him. Once cocked and loaded he got up and sprayed all the bullets. He just wanted to see them run
 
He smiled at his collage of mass murder. No one could touch him. Here he was god.
 
He slumped his rifle over his shoulder and admired his work. They were too afraid to come.
 
Suddenly, but she was defeated by several injuries, lack of energy and mental torture of the battlefield.
 
'Desert
 
He motioned to his colleagues on his side to cover him. Walking the past barrier
 
Ignoring the shouting, he just had one thing in his mind. Tonight he was having a feast!
 
THE DEVIL'S CELLAR
 
The woman was chained in a dark cellar. It smelled of old dust and musty oil. The bars and walls were covered with cobwebs
 
Each hand was tied by rusty chains supported by a post on both sides. She was forced to either stand upright or slump and let the pressure of her body tense the chain around her wrists.
 
She felt a mouse brush her leg and let a scream in fear while jolting. Immediately
 
Why didn't they just kill her?
 
She was struck by horror. What they were going to do to her?
 
Suddenly, like a panther in hiding waiting to pounce.
 
She could hear the person walking up to her. The moonlight only revealed the boots and military trousers. The upper half was veiled by the lusting darkness. Even so, her body trembling from fear and her breath racing. Here she was, naked, stripped of dignity and humiliated. He loved the power he had. He was in control, and she was her prey.
 
'This bitch is mine
 
In a sudden move, went behind her pulling her backwards by her hair. He put his hand over her mouth, unzipped his pants and thrust into her.
 
Her scream muffled against the cold, she screamed.
 
“PLEASE STOP!”
 
“NO”
 
“PLEASE!!!""
 
She knew there was no one who could save her. He pushed harder with every force against her with increasing pain. Her legs were trembling. Her body was shaking. With one long last thrust
Wiping the sweat of his forehead
 
He met three of his men down the corridor.
 
“The bitch is all yours
 
By the time he reached the end of the long corridor
 
THE BIRTH OF HOPE
 
Nearly five months passed. The woman repeatedly abused, but hers were dead.
 
The same prison
 
So many of the militants had their way with her. She didn't know which one fathered the bastard child she was carrying. She could only feel the baby move in her. She didn't care whose it was
 
Hisham was in the mood again. He strode towards her cell
 
There was no fun anymore. He wanted to change that this time.
 
He walked up to her near-limp body. Her eyes were blank
 
He grabbed her face
 
'The bitch cared for this kid
 
He drew a blade from his side pocket
 
And without thinking he pressed the knife on top of her belly, he started slicing around the belly.
 
Scream after scream
 
“STOP … PLEASE STOP … NO!”
 
Her screams couldn't help her. He kept cutting her open.
 
He was halfway around and then stopped. Her belly was half skinned open
 
 
She couldn't feel relieved but at least he stopped. The pain was unbearable until he grabbed the open side of her stomach and swung it to the other side to rip her entire skin off. She screamed so loudly
 
Everything was now revealed. Blood was splattered around her feet. She was shaking uncontrollably. She just wanted it to end. He threw the separated flabby stomach skin to side as if it were junk.
 
'Now comes the fun part
 
He could see the foetus wedged inside her. Ferociously
She screamed. Her baby was in his hands.
 
“Please don't harm it
 
She was losing too much blood. Her vision started to blur.
 
He looked at the disgusting flesh in his hand. It was weak and pathetic, dripping pus and blood on the floor.
 
He then held the thing in front of her. He let her stare at the unborn baby for a split second before splitting its neck. The baby was dead.
 
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
 
He swung the flesh over his head and pulled out a pistol and shoved it into her mouth. In that one moment
 
The bullet went through head and blood splattered against the wall behind her. Her body was completely limp as the chains in her hand tensed under her dead weight.
 
Her intestines scrambled to the floor.
 
She was dead.
 
REFLECTION POINT
 
I would first like to apologise if the story disgusted/offended you. But I had to make sure that what I wrote really affected the reader. We have become such a cold-hearted society that we have become apathetic to mass murder. We are witnessing an act of national terrorism
 
If you felt anything from this story, hurt, disgust, anger, then please use that to help me raise money for the Syrian people. Don't just sit there and think others are doing something or it won't make any difference. This is the wrong mentality!

Colby said he'd always been fond of Ives's Fourth Symphony. Howard said that this was a ""delaying tactic"" and that everybody knew that the Ives was almost impossible to perform and would involve weeks of rehearsal

Hugh was worried about the wording of the invitations. What if one of them fell into the hands of the authorities? Hanging Colby was doubtless against the law, belonged to us in various important senses, and he had after all gone too far. We agreed that the invitations would be worded in such a way that the person invited could not know for sure what he was being invited to. We decided to refer to the event as ""An Event Involving Mr. Colby Williams."" A handsome script was selected from a catalogue and we picked a cream-colored paper. Magnus said he'd see to having the invitations printed, and wondered whether we should serve drinks. Colby said he thought drinks would be nice but was worried about the expense. We told him kindly that the expense didn't matter, that we were after all his dear friends and if a group of his dear friends couldn't get together and do the thing with a little bit of eclat, why, what was the world coming to? Colbv asked if he would be able to have drinks, before the event. We said

The next item of business was the gibbet. None of us knew too much about gibbet design, said he'd look it up in old books and draw the plans. The important thing, as far as he recollected, was that the trapdoor function perfectly. He said that just roughly, counting labor and materials, it shouldn't run us more than four hundred dollars. ""Good God !"" Howard said. He said what was Tomas figuring on, rosewood? No, Tomas said. Victor asked if unpainted pine wouldn't look kind of ""raw

I said that although I thought the whole thing ought to be done really well and all, invitations, musicians, and everything, was a bit steep, and why didn't we just use a tree -- a nice-looking oak, or something? I pointed out that since it was going to be a June hanging the trees would be in glorious leaf and that not only would a tree add a kind of ""natural"" feeling but it was also strictly traditional, who had been sketching gibbets on the backs of envelopes, musicians

At this point everybody looked at Harry, wouldn't be friends of Colby's and couldn't be expected to donate their services, any more than the bartender or the musicians. He said that he had about ten limousines, which he used mostly for funerals, and that he could probably obtain another dozen by calling around to friends of his in the trade. He said also that if we did it outside, in the open air, we'd better figure on a tent or awning of some kind to cover at least the principals and the orchestra, he said, and weren't we being a little Draconian? Howard said rather sharply that all that had already been discussed, he could not. Howard said a firing squad would just be an ego trip for Colby

Then the question of the hangman came up. Pete said did we really need a hangman? Because if we used a tree, he very much doubted if there were any free-lance hangmen wandering around the country, now that capital punishment has been done away with absolutely, temporarily, and that we'd probably have to fly one in from England or Spain or one of the South American countries, and even if we did that how could we know in advance that the man was a professional, a real hangman, in front of every body? We all agreed then that Colby should just jump off something and that a chair was not what he should jump off of, who is quite modern in outlook and not afraid of innovation, and that although he was sure Colby would perform creditably and not disgrace his friends at the last minute

At the mention of ""wire, suddenly spoke up and said he wondered if it wouldn't be better if we used wire instead of rope -- more efficient and in the end kinder to Colby, he suggested. Colby began looking a little green, and I didn't blame him, because there is something extremely distasteful in think ing about being hanged with wire instead of rope -- it gives you sort of a revulsion, when you think about it. I thought it was really quite unpleasant of Hank to be sitting there talking about wire, just when we had solved the problem of what Colby was going to jump off of so neatly, so I hastily said that wire was out of the question, and the meeting broke up.

Everything went off very smoothly on the day of the event (the music Colby finally picked was standard stuff, the event was well attended, and we didn't run out of Scotch, or anything. The ten-foot rubber ball had been painted a deep green and blended in well with the bucolic setting. The two things I remember best about the whole episode are the grateful look Colby gave me when I said what I said about the wire, and the fact that nobody has ever gone too far again.

His hands once did semi-great and mundane things. The hands used to touch hot circular metal with long handles attached to them so that the operator wouldn't get burned. They used to perform in front of people completely captivated by the sounds they unleashed form a slightly raised platform at the back of a dark room.

Night fell. As the sun dipped below the waves, in an attempt to identify the shadowy fighter. Suddenly, his mind flashed with recognition. The bloodied, scarred man standing before him was none other than the one he had trusted with his darkest secrets, with his most desperate plans and the terrible details of his horrific past. It was his Lieutenant. 

""So, the soldiers who trusted you to lead them, die at the hands of their worst foes."" The Lieutenant said nothing. With a burst of lightning quickness, the swordsman pulled his weapon from the sand. Rivulets of blood ran down the side of the blade. He stifled a scream of pain as he pushed himself up on his elbow, and then rolled to his feet. Painful as it was, the swordsman took a fighting stance. A look of amused surprise slowly appeared on the Lieutenant's face. He reached behind his back and drew a bone-white sword, its smoothly-finished metal hilt glinting in the dying sunlight. ""Don't fight me,"" the Lieutenant said. ""It cannot end well for you. Stand down

The swordsman's blade came down in a silver arc, was forced to parry. He whipped his blade around at the swordsman's head, only to find that the old man was no longer where he expected. The swordsman had ducked under the slash, bringing the tip of his sword up into his opponent's armpit. The Lieutenant screamed in rage, his armor penetrated. His foot swung furiously back, catching the swordsman by the ankle. The swordsman fell, exhaling thunderously as he hit the beach. The Lieutenant's blade was a white blur as it swung down at its master's old friend and confidant, sprung to his feet, once as white as ivory

He let out one last groan as he looked up at the silver circle of the moon, the seawater lapping up past his ancient greaves.

Andy’s co-workers, and to others its sad; no one says anything to Andy directly about it though. So when Andy falls asleep at his desk we go along with his excuse that he stayed up late last night because there was a west coast game on that went into extra innings; and ,man, is he tired. Oh Andy, Andy has a million excuses but never a dollar the day after payday.

While his co-workers, Andy is buying heroin and paying back anyone who lent him money the week before and is lucky enough to track him down. Oh Andy, is heroin really that good? Something about you rouses a demon that sleeps deep inside of me.

Oh Andy, I wonder if you ever regret trying heroin. I'm sure sometimes you do, but more often than not, you’re too busy trying to find heroin or trying to use it.

Andy is such a nice guy. Andy is killing himself. We’re watching, but it would be nice if someone offered it. But hey, there's only so much time in a day, and we've all got our own lives to manage. So Andy manages his heroin habit alone.

Andy lives with his mother. She looks at Andy but does not see him. Andy’s mother thinks that a daily heroin habit

They fight over the missing money sometimes. Andy doesn't want to

Sometimes Andy will miss a few weeks of work. These are the times when Andy goes to detox. In detox they give Andy things like Suboxone and Methadone to replace the heroin that his body is used to. But they aren't quite the same. Andy likes the ritual. The needle and the spoon; finding a vein. Andy likes the tightness of the cord when he ties himself off. Andy likes pulling the plunger back and watching the blood flow up into the needle. To be honest

When Andy comes back to work from rehab, shows us why hes the best of us. He practically sings while solving problems and making money for the company. Because Andy is a great worker. He just happens to be addicted to heroin. Andy’s killing himself.

The worst days for Andy are the days right before payday. He’s borrowed money from everyone who’ll lend it to him. That set of people grows smaller by the week. His mother has hidden her cash

Why are we letting you kill yourself Andy? Why don’t we stop you? We don’t hate you

Oh Andy, but it was payday and you had a bag of dope that you needed to shoot. So you walked right past her, up the stairs closed the door of your room and floated away. When you came back, your mother wasn't crying anymore. The moment had passed.

Remember the day they found you in the bathroom at work Andy? Passed out with a needle sticking out of your arm. You tied yourself off with a shoelace. We thought you were dead. But the EMT gave you a shot of something and you came right back to life again. You vomited

But by tomorrow the roar has become a whisper. We make plans for the weekend. Plans for the summer. But we don’t make any plans to save you Andy. And soon we forget. And you’re back at work after a few weeks; smarter and funnier than ever. The old Andy is back. One day you asked to borrow twenty dollars; you said you lost your ATM card. Sure pal

You died that day Andy. Officially of an overdose. Oh Andy, what if? Oh, Andy.

And she was polite; she never misplaced a word or spoke ill of another in their presence. And finally

But that's why Roger couldn't stand her. As she strutted from plebeian to plebeian pretending to commiserate with their inconveniences and chuckling hollowly at their awful jokes

It was certainly subtle. You had to look past her actions and question her motives. Why did she blush with every compliment? Why did she offer to help cute boys study? Why, virtuous individual? Not when they're to garner attention and satiate her edacious ego.

When it came to guys, lavishly deny their claims, and, after unctuously telling them how much she appreciated the offer, say no. That way, she'd always be desirable (guys want what they can't have, right?)

And it worked. Vanessa had plenty of top-notch suitors, none had been worthy of her. She did, however, feel like the hottest shit on the planet. Guys sent her flowers, chocolates, poems, and snapchats and she flitfully played along, she became irritated. Her teeth grinding together, fall in love for the first time. But as soon as her subsequent batted eyelashes, confidently returned to her throne of superiority

So what is a victim of this supposed cycle to do? In Roger's case, and his eyes will track her relentlessly across the room, but he will not utter a word. After all, no one can prove your error if you hide it and demonizing Vanessa is easier than accepting personal failure.

I woke up this morning on an unfamiliar couch clutching a peppergrinder in one  hand and a Red Bull in the other.  An angry

I woke up a second time this morning with my face pressed to the musty upholstery of a vaguely familiar couch.  From my awkward vantage point, which, having  caught my attention once again, chose that particular moment to mount its  final offensive and break free of the injustices that I had so thoughtlessly imposed upon my body the previous night.  As I lay incapacitated by the uncontrollable heaving in my diaphragm, I recalled the objects that I clutched in either hand, and the more pressing matter of where the fuck I was.  

Laboriously, for a second time this morning, I regretted it deeply.  However, spurred on by the powerful demons of shame and despair, I stood up unsteadily and plodded off in search of cleaning facilities.  The first thing I found was a coffee table.  Rather, my left foot found it.  I found a carpet whose must made a fresh meadow of my green friend. After some half-hearted struggling, I stood up again.  This time, I made my way to the nearest door

In retrospect,  or even by approaching the snoring occupant of the bed in the far corner of the room.  However, I had already relieved one of three plumbing urges in an inappropriate place and I was determined that the other two would be dealt with in a more orderly fashion in a more suitable location.  

As I stumbled through the crass early afternoon sun, upstanding establishments of varying degrees of debauchery and a distinct lightness in my backpocket informed me that I was most likely in all sorts of financial trouble.  The optimist in me commanded that I look on the bright side of things, but my eyes screamed in  protest at every flash and glare they met with so I compromised and continued on without looking at all.    

To passers-by I must have been a sight.  The stride of my left leg was by far outpaced by that of my right, my hairstyle was pristine, but that was only the intentional byproduct of a carefully maintained lack thereof.  I easily feigned a tired and vacant expression on my face and studiously avoided eyecontact with my silent judges by staring at my untied shoelaces until I reached my front door.  

There are few pleasures in life that outweigh that of a cold glass of water when your mouth is so dry you cannot move your tongue.  However, I feel  the momentum of the liquid in my stomach with every motion of my body, accompanied by  splashing sounds which herald yet another act of excess.  My body is bloated by rash decisions which I suspect outline some form of avoidance behaviour, but I can't for the life of me pinpoint the exact cause thereof.  I put my moka on the stove and begin to  brew a strong cup of coffee and retire to the shower to wash away any remnants of the  night and my shameful start to the day.  

I fumble with the dial and am immediately punished with a barrage of ice cold needles which bite my skin, opening only the last bottle to squeeze out a few  drops of civilization to rub onto my body so that I can convince myself that I am presentable. I stand, face down, letting the water flow down my back contemplating an image of myself deep in pithy contemplation, conjuring a fantasy of reaching some yet unrevealed philosophical realization.  Finally, I realize that my coffee is burning.  

The sickly sweet smell of burnt coffee will penetrate every conceivable corner of my apartment, fashionable, but not avant garde, and spotless but not clean.  Between my formulaic bodywash and run of the mill deodorant, there is no evidence that I haven't done the laundry in weeks, but the ever so slight dullness in my clothes establishes an aura of mediocrity and shabbiness to my appearance.  Not so far as to imitate the trainwreck that I was this morning, far enough for me to feel as unimpressive as my shirt.  A few dark smudges on the backs of my hands are all the evidence I have left of the previous night.  Those, even though my obnoxiously strong coffee has already  made me mildly giddy and apprehensive.  It is in this unremarkable state that I begin another dull Wednesday at 4PM.  

You see, and dream about women whose conversational abilities would overwhelm only the most naive of teacups.  Unfortunate me, I see the world through a finer lens at a higher resolution than most.  I am capable of great feats in the realms of art and science.  Should I  put my mind to it, I can understand the currents of politics or the fundamental shifts in societal values at a level worthy of my education.  My motivation is absent due to a lack of circumstance, not by any fault of my own.  There are those who are blessed with this obscene drive to do things. I am, unfortunately, not one of those people.  I something or someone to come by and start my engine and keep it running, I will achieve something great.  I get  flashes of inspiration that others dream of, floating.  

This is what I tell myself as I reach my office.  This what I tell myself to make everything seem ok. The hollow caffiene rush from the coffee and Red Bull makes it impossible to sleep at my desk, I surf the internet searching for that elusive flash of inspiration that will motivate me to achieve my potential. After a few hours, I prepare to leave.  It didn't happen today, but I only need that one in my lifetime, after all.  

Tomorrow, throat parched and unable to hold a thought in my head until 4pm.  Tomorrow, I will wonder about what will have happened tonight and finally give up.  Tomorrow, I will come to the philosophical realization that nearly washes over me every day in the shower.  Tomorrow, I will have a flash of inspiration that will motivate me to get myself moving to the ultimate achievement which will justify the life I live. Tomorrow, today will no longer matter and I will no longer have to feel unremarkable in the mirror.  Tomorrow, I will no longer forget the precise point of my actions midway.

It took me a few more seconds to realize that the darkness was probably attributed to the fact that my eyes were closed. There was no improvement upon opening them, almost similar to the sound of water rushing along rocks. I listened to it for a few more seconds

The control failed and my imagination took over. The sound began to seem more and more like the sound of dirt falling slowly onto a coffin. Was I being buried alive? My body stiffened at the thought. My hands ran over the inside of my box

Then, as the lid of what I had thought was my casket began to open automatically. I sat up slowly, blinking away the spots that had showed up in response to the light.

The sight that greeted me was hardly the dark gloomy setting of a cemetery. I seemed to be in a long white hallway. What looked like windows on the walls were made from one-way glass
I began to try and stand up when a screen suddenly came to life on the wall across from mine and a thin

Her voice rang through the halls with a short message: “Hello, please watch the following film summarizing your own history and that of the others around you. Enjoy!”

The screen flickered and images began to run across the screen of what I assumed were important events in the past. I saw ruined cities, and homes on fire. A new, gentler voice began to narrate the images.

“In the past, it became obvious that the outcomes of those events were based mainly on the leading people of the nations involved. Environmental problems were best addressed when someone with the correct motivation and personality was able to come out and lead others away from destructive tendencies. Social problems were an enigma to those who did not have an intuitive sense of how to deal with them. Wars were lost without leaders who truly understood the principles or war. That is why we developed a way to keep those types of people in reserve for a rainy day. You are aboard the product of that research right now. You are on the Starship Ares.”

Once the video stopped, no matter what the lady in the television was telling me. Then again, I couldn’t remember much of anything.

I began to try and stand up, but found that my legs were almost completely useless. I could barely move them.

“Just a moment, I imagine. It has been a long time since you were last woken.”

I didn’t respond, and even on his knees he towered over me. He wore a flowing robe of white, with four separate pockets sewed in to the sides. Out of one he pulled what looked like a gun. I strained my legs in trying to rise and defend myself, but he pushed me gently back down onto the foam beneath me.

“Relax, there are some side-effects. This will counter them.”
Realizing that I didn’t have much of a choice, and this brought great relief.

“Who are you?” I asked. “What am I doing here?”

He looked at me with an almost bemused look. His face was long and his eyes were an almost luminous blue. He had no hair or eyebrows, he had a kind face.

“I am hurt, but you usually call me Fred unless you are angry at me,” he said, smiling. “As for what you are doing here, the video explained that. You are here to save the world,” he continued, before saying finally

He rushed to her, to take her in loving embrace. She had managed no more than half of her question, which would go unanswered. ""What are you d-"" She tried to ask, but he had already scooped her up, with a little more force than he intended: her question tapered off with a squeak as he carried her to her bed.

He lay her down delicately, he took in her breath, so sweet, and comming in rushed, clipped little gasps. Her eyes were wild, urgent, waiting. Her mouth opened to speak, even unwanted. And besides

With the words aside, rushed breaths, the way her heartbeat sped up at his touch, the urgency, the longing, the need. He would drink it all in greedily, this was his ambrosia.

A happily occupied hand made its way down, his hand still moving to a happier, lower place. It didn't matter anyway, her garb wouldn't keep him from what he wanted.

She inhaled sharply, but it was lessening now. her hand reaches out, grabbing forcefully at his vest. The other hand, with no clear goal, simply grabbed the bedsheets with a white-knuckled grip. Her eyes close in a wince, and beneath his hand, he can feel her jaws clench together. The motions are repeated on both sides, and she shudders against him. She seemed to slow

One final motion, drawn out longer than all the others, a deep, slow exhale. She lay back, now very still. Quiet, and her eyes still shut from her previous exertion. He lay his forhead against her own, and slowly withdrew his hand from her mouth, and he took the time to appreciate it.

After a long moment, surveying this now grisly scene with a distant, emotionless gaze. She had grown pale, her skin now nearly as colorless as the blood soaked sheets on her bed. Her leg hung awkwardly off the side of her mattress, but she gave no indication of discomfort. Her face had settled into a terribly familiar expression, that wonderful, horrible peace one only felt in their final moment in the world. Her eyes bothered him, dispelling the peaceful expression with a half lidded squint.

He almost reached out

His senses, to the window he had entered, and was outside, quiet as a ghost. He strode casually into the alley, without even a glance back. Noone paid him any heed as he went, something else had everyones attention. A mans anguished cry filled the air, and something in the sound seemed to reverberate among the people: a collective shudder filled everyone walking by, nor did it shield him from the sound that accompanied it

He stepped out of the alley, the sensations coaxing him into the familiar, dark places in the back of his mind. He dreamed his dreams, and sat silently in the darkness, waiting for his chance.

1370326176.0,1fmx6j,Animalism,malis271,5,1,2,"It occurred to me while listening to the radio the other how animalistic popular music has become. I mean animalistic as in; how close we have come to our primal root.

At some point in human evolution, that we are better because we are smarter. We are human.

However, one part human. Mixed in among the blend  is an animalistic element, and it is the single most terrifying truth of our existence.

We have spent thousands of years building gaps between ourselves and our animal heart. We organize ourselves in ways animals don’t and retain self-image in ways animals wouldn’t think to. We pleasure seek, converse and enjoy each other’s company in ways animals can’t. We would like to forget our embarrassing past among the tall grass, sucking on bone marrow to survive, hunched against the cold in our dingy, primeval cave.

But as I drove down the highway, smoothed by progression and innovation, and as I listened to the radio that man invented, that harnesses and controls some part of the natural spectrum of existence, the same existence that man claims superiority too, I heard the pound of the bass, the beat of the song. The beat of our animal heart, meant to be heard but more importantly meant to be felt. It was sex, thoughtless. It was adrenaline, the possibility of hunting and being hunted.

All that matters anymore is the beat. It is instinctual. It is the easiest part of ourselves to facilitate. Being human is more complex and carries with it melodies and verses filled with societal responsibilities, we cannot control it, and most often we repress it in pursuit of animalistic ambition. It is societies’ greatest irony that our animalism, our animal heart, is our most grievous embarrassment as well as our most facilitated being.

“This way champ. Don’t worry your mom...will...” a pearl streamed down the doctors cheek. The boy noticed, trying to hide it. He took the boy through a door just a few doors down where the woman went in. “

Lyra stood in the doorway of the dressing room

“Ah yes

“I'm not performing with you tonight.” she said

“Excuse me?” the Master replied

“I'm done with the show. I'm not doing it anymore. You're going to have to find a new assistant.”

At this point

“Well, and the contract says...”

“You drugged me, fame, love...”

“...But the promises of a madman are as empty as your pretty little head

Not once did Lyra move her gaze from his. She knew he would refuse to release her

“Now go put on your things, you're in for one hell of a beating.”

She realized that the only viable response was to feign momentary subservience. “Yes master.” she replied

As sharp as he was, good girl. Now off with you!” Elements of playfulness pervaded his own tone, underscoring his outright insanity.

Lyra turned on her heel and walked to her dressing room. The door hung slightly open

“Hairbrush, her suitcase was practically overflowing. She paused and thoughtfully gazed at her sandals.

“This is it.” She said to herself. She reached her hand into the hidden compartment of the suitcase and pulled out “the instrument” – a common knife with a single edged blade sharpened to a razor point. The Master seldom allowed her to use utensils when they ate together

The illumination of the red light in the hallway caught her attention as it reflected off of the blade in her hand. The show was starting - it was time to go. Her stature was firm and her goal clear in her mind as she strutted towards the stage

She heard the roar of the audience as was blinded by the incessant haze of the overhead lights. Everyone had come to see the Master perform his tricks

“And now...” roared his voice

The audience was familiar with this routine. Every member applauded her entry with great enthusiasm

As she walked onto the platform, not as her usual subservient self. Boos began to replace former cheers, and the master felt a fair mix of anger and embarrassment.

He marched over to her while waving at the audience with a 'just a moment' gesture. “What on great mother earth do you fancy you're doing

As her arm shot towards his collar, it felt as if she were cutting butter.

He managed to let out a few exasperated gurgles before she slid the knife further up the sides of his neck. As it severed his carotid artery, watching his life slowly drain away, his hatred and cruelty being replaced by emptiness and his consciousness slipping deeper into the void of oblivion.

Most of the members of the audience had left in a panicked frenzy. However, came up onto the stage and began to charge at Lyra, thinking her to be some sort of murderer who needed to be brought to proper justice.

She had very little time to finish her task. She looked the Master in his near-vacant eyes one last time as he lay on the polished hardwood floor of the stage

With that, she closed her eyes, pressed the prime button, felt a sharp jolt, and vanished into thin air. He stood around confused for a few more moments, looking up, down and every which way, no one was left in the house save for the corpse of the accursed Master himself.

His show was no more, but none remembered for sure. The Master was a forgotten man, his show a sullen piece, and his evils finally lain to a well-deserved rest.

Lyra awoke on a sunny beach of crystal blue waters

“Home.” she said to herself

She walked on.

I’ve never had a very good memory. Not really. People always say things like “do you remember when…?” And I always say: 

“No? When was that?”

 It’s not embarrassing or anything. Just a pain. It’s just like a blank. I mean – God

Wait,’ ‘say thank you’ ‘remember to get off at the pools’, and then, there she was, my mum, just like doof. 

At first I remembered, and how I could only see peaks of the hard wood floor underneath. It was varnished and had all these holes from people wearing heels at dinner parties and stuff. Mum, well I'm not sure ok? But in my head, my Mum was wearing these violet blue heels. They were her favorite pair. They had this big thick heel with like a silver broach thing on at the front. My feet were so soft and pudgy and I always remember thinking that her feet, in those heels, looked old, ugly and thin. 

I was looking down because she was above me

“You go down…Grace, she continued. “See this shape, this L – that your hand makes when you hold it up like this?” She grabbed my hand in her cold thin one and traced the lines from the tip of my small index finger to the end of my thumb. I looked at my hand, they same way I stared at the glass wind chime that hung from our doorway or bugs in the dirt…I had no idea what she was talking about. “You see this L?” She asked. “That’s left; you take a big L, a big left, at the end of the street. Then you just keep going to you see the place with the big ice cream on top.  You know, the diary?”

Of course I knew. Its where I use to get pies with dad on Sundays

“Take this money and get me some milk please and if you want you can get a mix while there. We can share the lollies ok?”

I smiled. “I’m not going to share any with you.”

She put her hands on her hips and stuck her tongue out at me. I copied her and then we both laughed. 

I can see myself. Brown eyes, with her peach dress. It looked like the smell of peach lollies, or maybe, peach lollies reminded me of the dress. Both are sweet I guess. She was always in that dress. If I think about it, I doubt she was wearing that peach dress with those violet heels that would’ve been ghastly. But as I say, in my head that’s what she was wearing. 

She wore her hair like mine, I though she was pretty. 

I remember walking out the door and I knew that the world was too big for me. Not consciously, even then and that was greater than the size of the world. I squinted down the street. I was determined to get that milk.

It was a really hot day. The kind of hot you only remember when your little, cicadas blasting away hot, old men fanning their faces with their hats hot. I wiped my brow with the back of my arm and walked out, trying to remember what Mum said. I kept holding up my hands up in front of the sky, but they both made L’s if you turned them around, and I suppose I confused myself. By the time I reached the end of our street, I had no clue where to go. 

Fuck it was scary

When we arrived at the store he let go of my hand and asked if I was going to be ok. I pulled at my dress and looked around the store

“Um yup I think so.” I said. He smiled at me

“You’re welcome little lady” and then off he went

Inside it was cool, but I could feel Eric’s (that’s the guy who owned the dairy), I could feel his eyes on me. I tried to act all grown up so I walked past all the lollies and junk, pushing my hair out of my eyes and went straight to the milk. The big bottles where up top and they were really hard to reach. 

“Do you want a hand?” Eric called out

“No thanks” I called back and I grabbed the biggest one I could.

It was so slippery, my eyes big like circles.  

He said

It was then

Eric must have come over mopping up the white milk as it seeped into the store, I had my face buried in her shoulder. I could smell her skin. It smelt just like powdered peaches.

 “Ssssshhhhh” she said. “ssssh sssssh its ok, everything’s going to be ok, I promise” Her words tickled my ear, they were soft and flawless. 

I raised my head, before it melted all onto my hand. The last thing I remember about that day, was that her promise came true and everything was ok. 

*

Later, much thinner and much more spotty hand. She lay on her side and breathed in slowly, they spaces in between filled only with my heartbeat. She stared at me with her big blue cloudy eyes. I looked back; my brown eyes were red and wet. Mum was waiting to die.

Her mouth was open and she had no more of her little pretty teeth. Just a black hole. Her long hazel hair had turned white and curly. 

She continued to breathe slowly…slowly

I squeezed her hand and said to her “Mum, you can go, don’t be scared, everything is going to be ok” 

She looked back at me until something inside disappeared. My mum had continued to breathe, spotty hand, cold already, grew colder. I realized I was no longer holding a hand. Now it just felt like a cold thing. She no longer moved. Not even a flutter. The little that was left behind those blue eyes had gone. I continued to stare at her only now there was no one looking back.

I breathed in as my eyes grew wet and said, you’re alright now mum, I promise, everything’s going to be alright now.”

And as I breathed out

1363868902.0,1aq8bs,The Escape,GoldMoonRocks,5,1,1,"There I was. I didn’t know where I was going

It was too dark to see anything other than what was in the small cone of light shining from the front of the cycle. Even in that, but I couldn’t be sure on that either. All that I was certain of was the low rumble of the motorcycle’s engine, the deep, pounding vibrations through the seat, and the wind blowing his hair in every direction above me. 

Who was he? I didn’t know then. Hell, I felt like as if a weight was being lifted from my shoulders. 

It was surprisingly freeing knowing that I was writing my own destiny in that moment. I had no idea what my future would hold, and the warm leather that belonged to my savior that night. Sooner than expected, the sun began to rise to my left. Apparently we had spent all night riding Southbound. I did not know and I did not care. Any direction aside from backward was fine with me. I estimated we traveled about six hundred miles that first night, although nothing was certain in my new life. 

He finally stopped for fuel in a small town on the intersection of two freeways. I thanked him from the bottom of my newly-freed heart, constructed thirty or forty years ago with cheap vinyl siding. As I walked through the streets, I pondered my situation. I could be anything here. No one knew me, or knew of my past. I was a blank slate to them. In that moment of revelation, I was even a blank slate to myself.

I made it through to the other side of the town in short fashion. There was nothing there aside from a small convenience station with one weather-beaten red pickup sitting idle at a fuel pump and a four way intersection. Since I hadn't eaten in over a day

To this day, I was greeted by the familiar, *ding dong,* that accompanies most station doors to alert the cashiers that it’s time to stop smoking and get back to work. The checker was a wrinkled lady about three times my age. She had a peculiar rasp to her voice that was somehow reminiscent of both Northern Ireland and Southern Kentucky. The only other person in the shop was a strikingly handsome brunette boy whose physique reminded me of a young Robert De Niro. As I walked past the drink coolers to the food aisle, I caught a smell of blackberries and tobacco coming from his direction.

I grabbed my food, *ding dong.* He headed toward his truck, but stopped midway, turned around, and headed my direction instead. He took off his maroon and silver jacket, probably earned from a local high school football team, and sat next to me. He introduced himself as “Sam” and said I didn’t look like I was from around here. I wanted to reply with, can’t a girl eat in peace?”

Sam asked me if I needed a ride somewhere, lightly tossed it into the bed of the truck and opened the passenger door for me. I rolled my eyes at his smug grin. Sam thought he was such a gentleman, but I knew better. 

His truck was just as rickety as it looked. It couldn’t go faster than fifty without wobbling fiercely. More importantly, so we made small talk for that hour. He talked a lot about himself and his dumb friends.  He had just graduated a few months prior and was looking to join his cousin in who cares where selling something or other.  I figured that I might as well humor Sam in listening to stories of his mundane life as long as he was helping me escape mine. 

After what seemed like hours in that truck, as if they would have even noticed I had left. Sam’s friends arrived thirty minutes after we did, and my memory only lasts about twenty-five minutes into the party after that.

When I woke up, it was nowhere to be found. Surprisingly, neither was the golf course, or the campsite, or any remains of a fire. The only remarkable terrain was the tree and a white marble statue off in the distance. 

I couldn’t believe it. I knew Sam was an asshole: I had seen it in his cocky smile. Those, with no directions. I decided to head towards the only other landmark I had, which was clearly manmade. As I walked, I started to notice that it was further away than I had originally estimated, and much, much larger. It was what felt like thirty minutes by the time I arrived at the base, although the sun hadn’t moved an inch in the sky. It was a large marble plinth, with a staircase spiraling around the outside.

I thought I could perhaps see further from a higher vantage point, despair. As I crested the top of the round structure, now about 15 feet across, I saw a birdbath, right in the middle made out of the same marble as the plinth below it. The feeling inside me seemed to be drawing me towards the center, where the water sat in the stone. I approached and placed my hands on the edge to see a familiar landscape in the depths of the fluid, which was not quite water.

The campsite from the night before was shown in the harsh lighting of sunrise. The fire looked hastily extinguished and there were tire treads in the dirt leading away, except she was in rough shape. Her clothes, what clothes were left on her, were shredded and flapping in the breeze. She was covered in bruises and lying unceremoniously in a puddle of foul dark liquid.

I had to look away. In that moment, and I was filled with an indescribable calm. I sat on the top of the plinth, far from the bowl as possible, and contemplated. Then, as I was staring into space, I saw motion in the corner of my eye. The great oak tree’s branches were twisting about, writhing and twirling, I left the plinth behind me for good and headed toward the newly-formed gates. 

I knew then, and I knew I was headed to one place they would never, ever find me.

The sunset cast a pink glow over the horizon. The last few rays stretched across the ocean, breaking the illusion as he leaned back. The sand softly clinked against the bottle of wine to his right and scraped against the pistol to his left. 

The mans name was unimportant. He was easily forgettable. He could blend into a crowd, who you pass every day. Who stares longingly at you as you walk buy but as far as you'd be concerned he's just a part of the tacky wallpaper. But he's always there whether you realize it or not. 

This feature of his was excellent in this case. Sitting on a beach in Florida, letting a few mouthfuls of the drink slide down his throat before wiping the bottle down and tossing it into the bushes. 

He stood up, a tiny light that could be easily mistaken as a star low on the horizon but the man knew better. He had dealt with this light before.

As the light slid across water, his heartbeat pounding in his ears and his mind filled with anticipation. Eventually it came towards land, near a marina. Hiding behind a pillar once again, the man made sure the gun was loaded and the safety off. The boat grew near, the lights now completely on instead of hiding in the background. 

Another man, mooring her to the pier and made sure the locks were all locked tight. As he turned to leave he was faced by a man with a cocked pistol pointed squarely at his head. The Cuban could almost see the hollowpoint 9mm round lurking in the barrel. He closed his eyes. A loud pop was heard, birds scattered, and you could hear a thud as his body slumped to the wooden deck. The man quietly slipped away into the night, the black enveloping him.

The police arrived a few hours later, popped the lock. Inside it was filled with water, they were about to close it when a hand slowly rose to the surface. 

After digging through the Cubans information they realized he went by a name that was respected out of fear in the Cuban community. The Coyote. A man who profited off the love of others by smuggling people out of Cuba and into the United States. They identified the remains

However in that stack of files was a man. A man who had lost his family to the Coyote. A man who had killed the Coyote. A man who blended into the background, the Man sat smiling on a chair in his small apartment. A man who raised his gun to his temple and pulled the trigger. ",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,

When they went down in the morning, there was nothing there. They decided that it was probably an animal, so they decided to leave out a trap to capture whatever was in the basement at night. The next morning, they went downstairs to find a large bobcat growling (I think they growl) and hissing in the cage. He was about to call animal control to take it away, the cage was far to bulky and heavy to carry it outside while unfolded and containing a bobcat. Without any real equipment, it was much easier to carry. They both loaded the suitcase into their truck and started driving toward the nearby forest area (they lived in Maine).

The drive was long. I remember the cold air as I inhaled

When I finally pulled into the driveway I noticed the house looked more run down then usual

As soon as I walked in I saw him passed out on the couch. One arm was hanging off, everything was dirty and the place smelled like hell. Must've been a long day for him. I didn't bother waking him up. I saw the wrappings on his arm. It ran the length of his forearm until it stopped just below his elbow. Just thought was he had gotten that sleeve he had always talked about, the one to commemorate dad. Then I noticed the wristband from the hospital. I sighed then looked around the house and I noticed a pile of mail on the table, the broken mirror shards leaving the bathroom, the half bottle of Jack Daniels in the kitchen next to the microwave with the door still open and cold Ramen still in there, the bottle of painkillers on its side, the contents scattered across the counter.

From the vantage point of my friend’s porch we could see them approach her building and stand just outside her door. She was anxious. He

I turned to my friend

They stood there. Talking. His jeans loose, and backwards flat-billed baseball cap, all synonymous with his profile. She wore a skirt, netted leggings underneath, large boots coming half way up her calf, a low cut shirt and a half buttoned up purple cardigan sweater, her sunset red hair kept neat under a black beret. These two friends stood talking in the dark of night; thinking that they were alone in this moment. That for a few minutes the world was theirs. I watched on, probably he did. He motioned to go. She asked him to wait. She stepped in for a hug and embraced him. He wasn’t reluctant, understanding that now, holding it. One hand on the door

I was fixated on her. I wanted to walk over to her and tell her I’m sorry it wouldn’t work out with him. I wanted to run after him and tell him what he’s doing to her. But I couldn’t. I watched her. This image is cast in my mind like stone. The yellow lights on the wall above her emitting their soft enveloping glow. The way she held most of her weight on one foot. Her head cocked slightly to one side and inclined towards his fleeting presence. And my friend reclined on next to me. Cigarette smoke drifting before my face in the breeze.

To me this moment only lasted about fifteen seconds. She watched after him. I saw in her body language how she registered the ramifications of their conversation and interactions. Her body slouched. Her hand fell off the door letting it swing in, the emotions she felt as he went farther away, without looking back: the impact of his words tonight, the realizations within that hug, the disappointment and despondency of that brief moment. She finally turned in—sad, lonely, defeated. I felt sorry for her. I felt guilty that I had intruded on this moment; that I watched something that was supposed to be private and within only her world.

If it wasn't for the Wednesday's specials and surplus of sluts, this place would be nothing less than an arcade fire concert screening Wes Anderson films. We loaded up on the cheap booze
     

As our uneventful night came to an end we decided to meet at Gus' infamous taco truck. We rode in two separate cars, but then again it always does. I would catch her staring at me while I drove. I couldn't tell if she was admiring my ability to drink out of my flask while keeping an eye on the road or my disregard for danger, all I knew is that she was amazed and probably aroused. I decided to take the scenic route.

    

Call it a hunch, shit was going down and I was going to help it. I ran towards the kerfuffle around Mikey's car and made it there just in time to see a tall, skinny, awkward looking man taking a swing at my good friend Mauri. I didn't need an explanation or reason to start handing out cans, that was plenty. I dove into the group of people fist first until I reached that tall awkward face. His acne infested skin felt soft against my rugged knuckles. It was a little too late to realize 'Awkward Skinny' had friends. Things went dark for a bit after this.


     

As I came to my senses, he had chosen his guy and he was going to take him out. Phony Mike was being gay in the car comforting Rosie. Mauri stood quietly studying the scene and Mikey was walking over to assist me when some random Joe appeared out of nowhere with a handful of fists for both of us. Now this 'Random Joe' did not know Mauri. He did not know that Mauri had been pretty peaceful this whole time, watching these events unfold. He did not know the rage that hid behind him. He did not know that Mauri is a cool guy, a regular mother fucking Teresa but if you fuck with his friends... well then he will fuck you up.
     



Mauri's shirt came off and his drunken stance became firm. With his fist up in the air he went around taking names and handing out prizes. 'Random Joe' and 'Awkward Skinny' turned their attention to the one taking out their friends and surrounded him. Rosie and 'Imposter Mike' came out to try to instill some peaceful sense into us. I watched helplessly as Mauri was surrounded by seven guys and a midget. (You know gangs mean bussiness when the 'gang midget' is called out for a fight.) To my surprise

     


'Random Joe' jumped on top of 'Gang Midget' and began swinging his arms. Gang midget struggled to keep his balance but managed to charge towards Mauri. As Mauri mouthed out ""What the fuck?!' he took a quick dive to dodge this 'one and a half man turbine'. The midget couldn't control his direction and ran right into a wall. 'Awkward skinny' bursted out in a maniacal laugh and pointed at Mauri, it looked like a japanese gangbang without pixels. I looked at Eric and Mikey and we all nodded in agreement, we had to get in. But just as we decided to join the fun, Mauri burst from within sending all five of them to the floor. Shirtless Mauri stood up and pointed at 'Awkward skinny' 
     

""You!"" He began
     

""You wanted a fucking beer
     

The fab five quickly recovered and tried their luck again. Awkward skinny kept laughing. Something was clearly wrong with him.
     

The five fucks took their swings and kicks, they stopped their futile attempts to touch Mauri. 
     

""Is that all you got?!"" Mauri teased. 
     

The winded five farts had nothing. It was Mauri's turn. To say he knocked them out fast is an understatement. He walked through them making them taste his friendship fury. He made his way towards that tall awkward skinny fuckhead that had started it all.
      

It was pretty clear this was Mauri's fight, but Mauri swallowed what was left of his pride and turned away. The crowd that had gathered cheered and chanted his name. He walked taller than before and began making his way back to the car. Just then, 'Awkward skinny' pulled out a full bottle of newcastle and pitched it towards an unaware Mauri. We all looked in shock,and questioned ""How the fuck does someone hide a full bottle through an entire fight?!"" but we quickly realized he hadn't participated for most of it. We tried to yell out to mauri but our expressions warned him faster and he majestically turned around to quickly catch the bottle. He promptly opened it up and chugged it like a legend in the making. Alex, who had not been part of this whole night, just happened to be getting himself some tacos, he witnessed this last unjustice and ran towards awkward skinny to launch his frail ass towards a car. ""No one throws out a full Newcastle"" Alex sighed.
     


Mauri and Alex joined us back by the car to finish our brew. I could tell Rosie had lost all interest in me and was going to spend the night with Mauri but I wasn't even mad,,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,True

Together

The two who enter the building make no sound, who places a finger on his lips, shushing. The child understands, and nods before quietly walking over. The woman is crying. The child kneels next to her on the little padded bench in front of the candles. 

After a time, and the two go outside again. They watch from the door of the building as the woman goes up to one of the little statues in the yard. She stands there, and the child leads the man over. As they approach, the woman leaves. The child cries out, waving to the woman. The man shushes him, but not before the woman turns around.

The man braces as though preparing for something terrible, but without seeing-- for a brief moment, then turns again and leaves. Once the woman is gone, the child returns to the man's side.

The strange pair looks down at the statue of an angel embracing a tablet. On the tablet is an inscription. The child cannot read it

""Sometimes people write things on stones when they want to remember them for a long time.""

The child doesn't have a response. They look at the statue for a bit.

""You're not coughing anymore

""Your cough is gone."" The man says to the child. ""Are you feeling better now?""

How did a reflection follow your actions so perfectly? Were they really reflections
And so it came about that he tried to beat the mirror. Experimenting with the massive slab of glass opposite his bed… Moving quickly, and popping up completely randomly…
But none of it worked. The mirror always knew what he was doing
Something jerked him out of his musings. He sat bolt upright and opened his eyes. There was his reflection
And then he saw it. He, every muscle tensed. His reflection was reclining, leaning back. In slow motion, he saw the realisation on the reflection’s face, and then it tried to subtly shift into John’s position.
He moved quickly – he stood up like a flash, and it didn’t try to copy him, but stood and watched.
When he came back, he thought it might be wise to that a second time.
But that night, and he instantly knew that it was the mirror.
‘It’s okay
Little did he know that he had broken a curse. A curse placed oh so long ago to keep the reflections in check. To lock them in mirrors forevermore.
By the time John heard footsteps, fingers were wrapped around his neck in an iron grip, and soon he was dead.

My baby. My sweet

Once Upon A Time... that's how all my mother's stories begun. Once Upon A Time, something natural, not the man-made sky of bulbs that you know now. Once Upon A Time there were many governments, not just one, and they were here to protect us.

Those were the more ludicrous stories, with the stale air and rampant disease and inherent despair that made this place a home. In her dying breaths my mother begged me to have faith and I denied her. I should feel guilt; I do not. I only feel hunger. 

Above ground, casting shadows that twisted and tricked. By day, I was to learn, things were very different.

There was no filth in the streets, made up of an infinite amount of light bulbs and hung thousands of feet above us. Supposedly the Roof of Lights encase the entire orb of the earth, and I often wonder what held it up. Buildings were all gray cement, except the homes, which everyone knew were mostly for show. Those were nearly all identical versions of a square, stout building of brownish bricks and white wooden doors. A fifteen by ten rectangle of grass that never grew sat in front of each one and various vehicles stood in each driveway, though only very important people drove. By day the metals bars that covered the doors and windows at night were not to be seen. This was all very new to me.

I emerged from a sewer grate in the early morning, unblemished beige, all the same, like they had been specifically bred to deny race. Brown eyes. Strict features. Very little individuality. I'd never heard of one speaking. I'd never heard that they even bledd or breathed, for that matter. I followed the signs along the roads to take me to the right one. Gardner Street. There was a market there. I hadn't yet put thought into how I would pay. I just knew that everyone said you could get food on Gardner street.

After two and a half hours of walking I began to wonder if Kara was okay, no sellers, no rats cooking, no rotting fruit in moldy baskets.

It was a gray cement building like the others but with big planes of glass making up the front to reveal the inside. Aisles and aisles of shelving filled with colorful cans, most unfamiliar to me, bread the was not burnt and cut into even slices, and meat! It was red and fresh and clean and I'd bet money that I didn't have that it wasn't from rats. Unbelievable.

I walked through the doors and instantly knew I didn't belong there. I didn't have Euro's. I smelled like the underground. If I tried to steal, taking in the delectable smells, trying to avoid the gaze of the clean workers in their uniforms. There wasn't anyone else in the place besides myself that didn't work there. Or so I thought, until I found myself in an aisle made up of closed closets made of glass that emitted a terrible cold. The boxes and bags inside had pictures of food inside and were obviously frozen.

He was tall. He was handsome. He had skin of smooth beige, wolfish grin cracked open his face and he strode over to me as if he owned the world.

“Your type doesn't belong here. Your type doesn't exist. So what

Panic froze me to the spot. I knew in that moment I was going to die. But instead of pulling out the electronic needle all police carried

“I'm just joking with ya, I can use ya. Nicely. Come on, we'll get food. Don't be scared, I've got money, I'm paying. Are you scrounging for just yourself?”

It took a few moments for me to realize he was offering to help me, knew how to handle it and even do it right to earn a morsel. Yet I didn't think he meant the same thing.

It's not like I had long to rationalize. My situation was crazy and I had no choice. He cocked and eyebrow and I nodded. I could only hope he meant to use what was under my skirt.

“So you're only getting what for yourself?” He asked like he knew the situation was otherwise. It didn't occur to me to lie.
“N-no. I have a baby. Two months. Feed her myself though” I blushed and was revlted by myself. He had not needed to know that.

“I thought so. Something had to spur you out the hole. Besides

He led me down aisle and occasionally handed me something to carry

“Three thousand, but she kept a calm face. Her blonde hair and pale skin soothed me; she was one of us, the humans, even if she did live in a different world.

Outside the building he took the bags from me. “You’ll get these, get your baby, and bring her here. You will both be staying with me for an indefinite amount of time. If you do not comply you'll likely both starve. Understood?”

I only nodded yes. By now the whole situation felt like a dream. I'd do whatever this angel said

“Good. How long will it take you to get back here?”

This made me pause. “A few hours, I know you don't know nothing about-”

Suddenly he was very close to my face. “I know much more than you. You know nothing. There is a sewer grate five feet from here. I know that's how you people go up and down and I know someone your age has the underground fair memorized. You'll use that entrance. You'll bring her here. I'll wait no more than four hours

1356073397.0,157sra,Wrote this a year and a half ago when I was (shocker here!) depressed. Just found it on my computer.,treskaz,9,5,5,"no name for the story


a young man walks into a bedroom. it's dark

it's the kind of room with its own stairs, all your siblings are jealous for the entirety of your growing up together. it's a rectangular room, with a window at each short end. the ceilings are slanted in to follow the sharp angles of the roof directly overhead, and the wall paper is a smoke stained white from years of his great grandmother sitting up there reading her old shitty romance novels and chain smoking. 

he flicks the power switch of an old tube amp, with the G string still a little flat, he begins to play. he plays a few songs he knows, not in their entirety of course, just fragmented parts to a greater whole. a greater whole he feels he can never accomplish. as he plays what comes from the guitar starts to lose all clarity, all sense as he begins to think about her. deep in thought, he forgot what he was playing. 

his mother shouts up his stairs for dinner time

the next morning comes and goes as nothing but sleep dictates his schedule, abandoning all hope after botching the placement exams, though his family doesn't know this. they simply think he's disgruntled, and will come around eventually, but he has kept private, his reasons. 

he wakes around one forty five in the afternoon, so he decides to walk to their spot about two miles from his house. their spot is the creek where as children he fell in love with her, the place they spent all their time together.

 they met at a young age no one can recall, face blank overlooking the creek. glaring at the water that's shit brown from all the mud and pollutants, he looks around his spot.

 there are large rocks scattered about, hundreds of years old. they're the only ones around save the few trees in people's yards, since the construction companies came in to build his development. but that was a long time ago.

 sitting in his old woods, or longer, he doesn't care or know how long he's been there. he raises himself up and carries himself home. when he gets to his house, he rushes straight up his stairs avoiding his siblings and father, ignoring his mother's question as to where he had been.

 it's four in the morning, which some kids had spray painted a large cartoon penis onto. he kind of chuckles to himself, but as he reaches the turn his face sinks into a deep grimace. he hated how much time he spent at his spot, but he felt so guilty if he weren't there. when he reaches his spot, he begins to climb the tree he had when he were younger. the tree he always climbed with her. the tree that served at the catalyst for the breaking of his arm when he was eleven when she laughed until she saw the thin piece of bone sticking out of his arm with the stream of crimson dripping heavily from it. he sat in his tree and thought. thought about everything. thought about his family, thought about his few friends he didn't talk to anymore, thought about how much he missed her and how sorry he was for what he did. as he always did at his special place in the woods, he cried.

 he asked himself why he thought he'd be alright that night. why he let himself do what he did. out of his backpack he took out a rope. it was a course rope one might think was made of sandpaper

 he couldn't help but stare at the spot she had died. he always found it ironic, with one leg bent up backwards past her head. the top of her skull was almost flattened, like a military man's flat top, only pushed down to where it wouldn't look humanly possible. to where it wouldn't be humanly possible save some sort of skull crushing event. he held her and cried for an hour. she was gone before he even got to her. she was probably gone after the fender of the impala was crushed from the impact of the moss covered rock jutting out next to the road.
 
with only a moment left of consciousness before his vision, he realized he was making a mistake. he thought about his family again, only this time he wasn't so critical of his parents' scoldings or his siblings' arguments. he thought about the friends he wished he talked to more. and lastly, he thought about her. he wished he could have done better by her, but knew it was too little, too late. he wished he could have said goodbye, maybe get a little closure, he also realized it's not too late to change. only, and as the rope cut more and more into his thin neck,

“It’s Mickey

Richard closed his eyes and took a deep breath

“We’ve got a new case

“That so?”  

Mickey nodded.  “Morphine.”

Richard stared out the window to the streets of L.A.

“Again, I thought we agreed you wouldn’t smoke in the office.  And I’d rather you didn’t at all, it’s really not a good habit.”

Richard turned to look at his partner of seven years.  His movements slow and methodical, he smothered the flame and disposed of the cigarette.  

“Thank you,” he stated.  Richard gave an inquisitive look.  “About the case,” he continued, “I believe I know who the supplier is.”  

Richard stood.  “Lead the way.”

Mickey stepped outside and into his Chevrolet Styleline, particularly his car.  They sat in silence, other than a single attempt by Mickey to initiate conversation.  Eventually, they arrived at a bar downtown.  Mickey led the way inside.

The bar was filled with cigar smoke, leaving Richard to stand, as there were only four seats.

Richard swore he had seen the man in the middle before.  The pale

“How’ve you been

The man across from Mickey gestured towards Richard.  “Who’s this

“This

“I don’t like him.”

Mickey turned to Richard

“Sorry about that

“What I’m more concerned about is why you don’t fall under that category.”

They drove in silence until arriving back at the office.  “Don’t wait for me

“That’s not a good attitude to have.”

“Don’t lecture me

Once inside, but was only able to grasp a moment of respite before being interrupted by the ringing of the telephone.  With a sigh, he answered it.  A woman’s voice on the other end went into details about a case.  

“Hold on

Richard set the phone down and opened a drawer.  He fiddled with papers

It was the first time Richard had ever looked into Mickey’s filing cabinet, Richard peered inside.

“Son of a bitch, bound together with a rubber band, labeled “T.B.,” was nothing but a three inch high pile of cash.  He leafed through it… all twenties.  Richard closed the drawer and went back to the phone.

“I’m going to have to call you back.”

Before the woman could protest

The night was quiet as the clock struck ten.  Far from downtown Los Angeles, then another.  Neither was the one he was waiting to see.  Thunder rumbled in the distance, yet not a drop of rain had fallen.  He slid his hands into his coat pockets, feeling the items within.  The smooth paper in the left, the cold metal in the right.

Richard heard another car and looked up. A maroon Styleline rolled to a stop in front of him.  Out stepped a man.

“What’s so urgent?”

Richard drew his left hand from his pocket

“Where the hell did you get that?” 

“I should be asking you the same thing.”

Richard watched as the man’s face twisted.  He motioned for Richard to approach him.  Richard obliged

“You know

Richard glared.  “I thought… I thought you were better than this.”

The man’s face twisted into a wicked grin, grinning at the ground as rain began to fall.  He looked up.  “What’s yours?”

Richard pulled his right hand out of his coat

“No… Richard

Richard shook his head in disgust.  “You were a good partner.”

The streetlights cast a shadow on the streets of LA.  As the rain poured

Richard Hale lifted a fresh cigarette to his mouth.

Begin Short Story:
   

    The Heart of Man


There is a silence in the air, carefully making its way towards its final destination.  Shooting into the abyss, random assortments of stars dance around in an awe inspiring scene of phantasmagoria.  If one were to see it now, soaring through the sky, it would seem motionless, with nothing in the backdrop to signify any sort of movement, only blackness.

Then, it becomes a repetition of high, rhythmic clicking sounds. Then silence returns.  Minutes, even hours seem to pass as the ship remains in a silent darkness. At last, a sharp panging sound breaks the silence, like the ringing reverberation of a church bell in the early mists of a Sunday morning.  A final latch comes loose, and the door of the cryogenic pod is allowed to break free from the steady grip of its fastener. The lights of the ship slowly flicker on, awake.      

Bright, when I find myself gasping for air.  I feel as though the air is too thick for my porous lungs, and with each new gasp my chest becomes more weighted and heavy.  My throat is clogged with a dense, warm film.  I force my heavy body out of the pod, but no sooner than I do, I find myself on the ground, limp.  The muscles in my legs feel so tired, dazed and confused, to clear my respiratory obstruction.  All around me, I reach out to grasp a thin cord hanging off of an ostensibly promising counter top.  Small bodies begin to shower all around me

A single light fixes now, I am able to see a little glass vial filled with a mysterious black liquid.  I grab for it in desperation, and let the quick, cool liquid slide down the back of my throat.  As I continue to drink, not only do I find my choking obstruction wearing away, but also a strange sensation of pulsating energy all throughout my body.  My weak, zombie-like state is lifted, illuminating brightness.  With my new empowerment, white counters and white space suits surround me.  A tall panel of buttons framed in a large white containment lies on the wall immediately to the left of me.  Completely regaining my senses now, a vast pool of blue would engulf all my vision.  You could feel a smooth breeze against your skin

I turn my attention over to the large metal pod from which I had emerged.  I touch the cool metal casing, I let my thoughts run to my previous life, the one before I had been chosen for The Mission.  I suppress my pang of nostalgia, and allow myself to move on.  I then read the small control screen on the outside covering of my pod.  ""Thawing Successful,"" it reads.  I found it bizarre that I was alone.  Why had my two comrades not been unthawed by now, just as I had?  All of our pods had been programmed to open exactly seven days before our landing on the planet, and we had been given strict instructions on how to use this time for the preparation of that.  I ease myself, all the world was ecstatic.  The first trip beyond our solar system was no longer merely a topic of high school sci-fi fantasy

Bringing myself back to the present, that can't be right.  I rub my eyes roughly, as if trying to remove the painful sheet of reality from my vision.  I read it again.  ""Error,"" it says.  I begin to toy with the buttons on the keypad.  Calmly at first, but I soon find myself becoming more and more frantic.  I turn towards the next pod, which has the same reading as the first.  I am at a loss of what to do, but feel that I must do something.  I grab a long, accidentally smashing one of the ships lights as I do so.  It becomes dim and dreary.  Using my weapon, and am surprised at what I feel.  There is no thick, and my eyes feel as though they begin to bleed.  The morbid scene horrifies me.  The pod had been tightly sealed

And then, completely alone.  All that I had left behind has frittered away. I have been left in ravages. 

I was on a mission.  I had chosen to leave my life behind, the only thing connecting me to the outside.  I stop for a minute.  The only thing I see is blackness.  The deep, sort of concentrated blackness that one experiences only when gripped strongly by the darkest clutches of slumber.

The perfectly synchronized rush to explosive electronica heaven is building in the sound system of my mind - again. And again.

The chemicals are slightly wearing off so as I tip out of the cab, cradle her in my lips and light up. I have no idea how I'm even standing but I skillfully negotiate against the refrigerated wind and as the relieving foul tasting heat crackles from the suction into my lungs, my head begins to spin - or spin faster really - and I take off again helplessly laughing at the non-existent idiosyncrasies of everyone around me.

Is there anyone around me?

The burning rum purchased at the airport lounge is nauseatingly dancing its way through my digestive system.

Sunglasses on and sleepless

The moment my forehead touches the cold glass

It's a 3 hour flight from New York to Chicago and beaming through the thin haze - how many feet below us? 20

Neatly separated by the fences of past disputes and lawsuits yet to be settled

Naturally vying for the attention of the other passengers - a standard fair of middle aged business travellers

As we chase the sun, beating us, indifferently flaunting the majesty of the parallel streams in its trail.

Like a yawning peacock

""Why don't you be beautiful too? Can't you see how easy I make it look?


Now eat my dust.""

This is not a race.

There are no television cameras or radio commentators or photographers secretly hoping for a career making collision. No one is cheering along for victory.

Well....

Not on my flight anyway.

I walk through campus, cold night. The lampposts littering campus and the music coming through my earphones are the nearest thing to company I have. Looking down the long stretch of vacant asphalt, I feel lonely in this empty environment of concrete and bricks. In search of something comforting, I decide to venture to some nearby neighborhoods. Less than a year ago, my friends and I would walk around the neighborhoods south of campus to talk about classes and smoke. These ritualized walks became a staple in my daily routine and the foreign area of Eugene became familiar to me. Coming from Las Vegas, and being a freshman in college, the entire university experience was new to me. Being a newcomer to Eugene, I held a certain amount of anxiety to living in a new place and meeting new people. After a short while, venting, wooden tunnel that towers over me as I pass through. On the other side of the tall
A raccoon the size of an overweight bulldog stares at me while its mouth hangs open, to test his patience; he claims this area. He kept eye contact with me, marking his territory, standing his ground. I see the open sidewalk in front of me, but I cannot move. Instead I am confronted by a living, wild road block in the form of a raccoon. He could attack me at any moment, jump at my shaking legs and claw at my body till he was finished. I can feel the thumping of my pulse in my chest and around my jugular. My pounding pulse surely must be visible to the raccoon. I am powerless against his brute force and wild instincts. I imagine the raccoon scratching at my neck
I begin to back up without realizing it. About face and then I fast-walk back to campus as discretely as I can.

Finding him has become a competition. We all want to be the one that traps the rabbit. He knows me from a time when I was on his side. I'm not sure if he will still trust me

I gesture towards my door offering sanctuary, and darts under my arm just as a team of officers turns the corner. I shut the door behind him, and brace myself as he tries to force it open. 

""Hey


He is trapped and knows it. His executioners walk in behind me. He sulks over to one of my desks. We shoot each other sideways glances as we take our positions. We nod silently saying

His case manager storms in followed by a suit. She immediately begins to deliver the lecture she has been waiting all day to give. I sit closest to him. He won't hit me... but her... none of us are too sure about her. The suit sits closest to the door

He tries to explain why he ran

 ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" 

but he must have been reading my mind too because he bolts up and yells it. The suit says in his best authoritative voice
 
I think to myself

He and I lock eyes again and I ask

""Not yet

""You know there are a lot of great courses offered here."" 

We maintain intense eye contact because this reprieve is fragile. 

""Is there a sculpture class? Remember when I made you...

POP!

I had heard it in the background too. The Bitch crossed the line. She is already at the phone and looking up the number for his mom. 

He begins to shake. ""You gonna call her so you can tell her more lies? Just like with that email you sent her."" He is getting angry again and his eyes are darting around the room. He is starting to panic. ""You know FUCK YOU BITCH! I've put up with fifteen years of abuse and you know that."" 

""I didn't lie in that email. It's not my fault if your mom didn't undesta..."" 

""It is your fault! I am back in that house now and I hate it. What happened over that email is YOUR FAULT."" 

She moves uncomfortably in her chair and looks away. She does feel the guilt. She changes her tone and softly says

He senses her weakness and lobs into his verbal assault. He goes on about how she lies and how much she hates him.  He begins to make fun of her for the tears in her eyes when I turn my gaze back towards him. 

""I know you don't like her

""It's true. I am the one that has to boss him around and he hates me for it. I was just trying to figure out what to do with him before we found out you were missing. He is worried sick about you right now."" 

He studies my face to for a tell. I hold his gaze and continue. ""Did you hear her? What she said? She said she's sorry and that you're right. Do you think you can forgive her?""

His face twists with rage and tears stream down his cheeks. He looks at her and begins screaming again. I reach out and hold his hand. 

""You know

            My job was a simple one. All I had to do was guard the Gate, and my home was far from the Gate, but the pay made everything well worth it. I was able to easily provide for my wife and daughter, and still had plenty of money left over.

I missed my family dearly, and I was going to leave in the morning to travel back home.

As I looked through the rain at the Gate’s silvery, and his short beard dripped small beads of water as the rain rolled down his face. His green eyes were kind and caring, and full of hope as he readied his pack for the morning. My face stared back at me, and suddenly grew dark and gaunt.

The man before me began to change, his hands thinning almost to bone, his fingernails growing to razor edges. He began to tower over me as his legs grew as well. His face stretched and thinned itself, taking the shape of a skull. His eyes burrowed into his head, leaving only dark sockets that stared into my soul. His mouth stretched open, showing rows upon rows of knife-like teeth as he let out a terrifying moan.

I stumbled back and grabbed my sword out of my sheath, howling and moaning, until it suddenly lifted its hand, and lunged toward me. I dropped my sword as it grasped my neck, strangling me as I struggled for air. It began to pull me toward it, slowly and tediously, as if it wanted to watch me suffer. I fought to breathe but could not break the creatures grasp

..….

..….

I awoke terrified, but at the same time I felt weak and powerless, as if something was controlling me. I swatted tree branches away from my head as I walked down the path and tried to stop, but my legs would not listen and kept walking.

I had walked this path every day for years and I was never tall enough to worry about the tree branches. I looked down at myself and horror sunk into my soul. I was the creature, and all I could do was watch as it walked as me. I was unable to stand the revelation, and I fainted, although my body trudged on.

..….

..….

I awoke again, receiving welcomes from passerby in the town center. I screamed at them, wondering how they did not see this dark, demonic creature as they waved their hellos, but no sound escaped my lips. I passed the window of a small store and saw why.   

As I looked at the windows clear, and his short beard was ragged from the long days of travel. His green eyes were dark and sinister, and were empty of any emotion as he stood in front of the window. My face stared back at me, and I cried out in anger and fear.

My body continued toward a small home in the back of the village, playing in the garden, and I saw my wife, Ann, through the window. Lily ran towards me and hugged me tight, and my body picked her up and smiled at her. She didn’t think anything was wrong, and my body put her down so she could continue playing in the garden. I walked into my home and I glanced at the mirror in the hallway. My face smiled at me as it drew a small dagger out of its sheath and hid it behind my back. I began to weep as I saw what was about to happen. My body turned and stopped as Ann rushed towards me. I screamed at myself as my arm thrust forward

I guarded that Gate so that I could provide for my wife and daughter. I guarded that Gate so I could build a better life for my family. I guarded that Gate because I loved them more than anything. I guarded that Gate, and destroyed everything I cared for.

The clock struck twelve.

I awoke.

I was alone.

I would forever be alone.

I got out of bed

One foot

One has to be careful getting out of bed.

You never know just when the floor will disappear on you.

Really.

It’s happened to me before.

I slipped into my slippers

Shuffling downstairs

No.

I did not.

But no matter. I was more or less used to it by now.

More or less.

In the kitchen, Cheerios from the cupboard beside it. I poured the blueberries and Cheerios into the bowl simultaneously. It was tradition, after all. Then the milk. Always the milk last. Can’t break tradition. If people start breaking tradition, then their floors start falling away.

I took a spoon from the cutlery drawer, visible just on the other side of the peephole. I could see her howling and screaming and crying. In my mind I could hear the words that were being formed a short distance away. A very short distance, and yet infinitely far. I wanted to open the door. I wanted to let her in. I wanted to hold her and caress her and love her more than anything in the world. But I couldn’t open the door now, not even to get the paper.

She was lost to me forever.

She was my wife.

Instead

She was not alone. My mother was there, and I could do nothing. I could not even tell them that I knew. I could not even tell them that I was here. They just had to guess. Guess and hope.

Knowing that there would be no paper today, growing ever larger. I shut the curtains. They would do no good now. It was too late. It had always been too late.

I switched on the TV, the same story was playing. Every morning the top news item was the same. In the papers, on the TV, even on the internet, it was the same. There had been a car crash. A man on his daily commute home from work had been blindsided by a drunk driver as he turned off the highway. The man’s car had fishtailed and flipped and struck a pole. The drunk driver’s had run off the road. The drunk driver died. The man did not. He was rushed to the nearest hospital, declared to be in critical condition. The doctors hoped he would wake up and make a full recovery. He hadn’t done either.

I turned off the news, and for the first time in a long time it was different.

I was shocked. I remembered the story of the man like it was my own. I could feel my fingers gripping the steering wheel as I was hit, and then the hopelessness. I could remember the world going black as I gave up. I had relived this story through the news so many times I was convinced it was my own.

But it was gone. There was a new story today. They had finally given up on the unconscious man. They were going to let him die peacefully. There was a camera capturing the whole event. After all, the universe. His wife was clutching his hand, howling and screaming and crying. His mother and father stood next to his bed. So did his sister and brother, his aunts and uncles and cousins and friends. Everyone who still cared for him or loved him. His wife pulled the cord.

Here again. Tired of the ebbs and flows of the sea. Frustrated at its isolation. The smooth rocking no longer nauseating but not yet therapeutic. Salt encrusted skin. The sun bearing down. Burning. Tanning. I sit here. Still. The sea - my fortress of solitude. I resent it. Stopping the future. Barrier to the civilized world. The foam from the waves distant on the sea. I wish I could be them. Escape this place. Move on. A tear tattooed on my skin
I tell you
That only men incredulous of despair
Half Taught in anguish
I watch the sun set

The taste of wood hung in the air, abstaining from their heart’s desires. I sit here, ordering another beer. I light a cigarette, disgusting things, but they sooth the soul. The cold air whips me awake, back from the murky afflictions of alcohol. The window mirroring me. Disgusting man doing disgusting things, the condensation clung like tears to my mirror’s face. 
She poured me another drink, those select remarkable, extraordinary, lonely few whom life had both gifted and cursed. I put my empty glass down, the bitter brew beginning its familiar softening works.

“To keep you company John
“No. You are irritating me. I think it’s time you leave”

“It’s ok; I understand how you feel it’s been a rough time for me too.” He lights the death stick. I stare into the flame

He looked genuinely apologetic. Upset at himself for bringing it up. I can feel myself crying, and try and stand. But my legs give out. Unable to carry the now crying blubber of a man. 
He walks away. Obviously unable to deal with the mess of a man I have become. 
I sit
He’s back. With tissues and some tea. He hands me the tissues and I take them
“I know.”
The only words to leave his mouth. I know. No longer desperately lonely.

Richard Dunn
It’s been a week. An isolated but no longer lonely week. I decide to return
As I walk through the gates. I take my time
You didn’t Die
You just changed shape
Become invisible to the naked eye
Become this grief.
I now understand the words before me. Accepting them.
She is here
“Hello” I say for the first time.
She smiles silently. I don’t know what to do. 
Said she
My heart cries out for some relief
“Then joy stepped in” 
She nods knowingly. 
Finally.

1351459111.0,128k1w,Stig Dagerman - To kill a child,szer0,6,0,0,"This piece was originally written in Swedish. I Found this english translation somewhere online a few years ago. It is the most powerful story I have ever read

Something is always lost in translation

---

*Stig Dagerman - To kill a child*

It is a fine day and the sun rests over the plain. Soon the bells shall sound

There falls no shadow over the kitchen and yet the man who shall kill the child stands by a red gas pump in the first village. It is a happy man who looks into the camera and in the glass he sees a small blue car and beside the car a young girl who laughs. While the girl laughs and the man takes the beatiful picture the gas salesman tightens the lid on the gas tank and say they will have a fine day. The girl sits down in the car and the man who shall kill a child takes his wallet out of his pocket and say they shall go to the sea and by the sea they'll rent a boat and row far, he's content and happy and before he gets into the car he stands for a moment in front of the radiator which shines in the sun and he enjoys the shine and the smell of gas and bird-cherries. There falls no shadow over the car and the shining fender has no dents and it is not red with blood.

But at the same time as the man in the car in the first village slams shut the door to his left and starts the car the woman in the kitchen in the third village opens her cupboard and finds no sugar. The child who has barely had time to button its jacket and tied its shoes stands on his knees on the couch and sees the river winding its way between the trees and the black little boat that lies pulled up on the grass. The man who shall lose his child is finished shaving and is folding his mirror. On the table stands the cups of coffee, because the boat waits on the beach and they shall row further out than they ever have rowed. When the child then runs through the garden it thinks all the time about the river and the boat and the fish who are swimming and nobody whispers to it that it has eight minutes to live and that the boat shall remain where it rests all day and many days thereafter.

It's not far to Larson's, they lie in the middle of the road nice and secure and alone - as yet. It's good to drive all alone on a soft, broad road and out on the plain it goes even better. The man is happy and strong and with his right elbow he feels his woman's body. He is not an evil man. He's hurrying to the sea. He couldn't hurt a wasp, and yet he shall soon kill a child. While they rush towards the third village the girl again closes her eyes and plays that she won't open them until they can see the sea and she dreams in harmony with the the soft bumps of the car about how serene it will be.

For so uncaring is life constructed that a minute before a happy man kills a child he is still happy and a minute before a woman screams with fear she can close her eyes and dream of the sea and the last minute of a child's life this child's parents can sit in the kitchen and wait for sugar and speak of their child's white teeth and about a rowing boat and the child itself can close a gate and start walking across a road with a few lumps of sugar wrapped in white paper in its right hand and this entire last minute nothing see except a long

Afterwards it is all too late. Afterwards a blue car stands on the road and a screaming woman removes her hand from her mouth and the hand is bleeding. Afterwards a man opens a car's door and tries to stand upright although he has a hole of horror inside himself. Afterwards a few lumps of sugar lie randomly scattered in blood and gravel and a child lies unmoving on its belly with its face tightly pressed against the ground. Afterwards two pale-faced people who have not yet had their coffee run out of a gate and see a sight on the road that they shall never forget. For it is not true that time heals all wounds. Time does not heal a dead child's wound and and it heals very poorly the pain of a mother who has forgot to buy sugar and sends her child across the road to borrow some and just as poorly does it heal the grief of the once happy man who has killed it.

For he who has killed a child does not go to the sea. He who has killed a child goes quietly home and beside him he has a silent woman with her hand bandaged and in all the villages they pass they see not one happy person. All the shadows are very dark and when they part it is still under silence and the man who has killed the child knows that this silence is his enemy and that he will need years of his life to defeat it by shouting that it wasn't his fault. But he knows that is a lie and in his nights' dreams he shall instead wish his life back so he could make this single minute different.

But so uncaring is life against the man who has killed a child that everyting after is too late.

In the year of 1812
“What are you doing out here Nomes Chomper?” asked Buck Chunker.  “Imma tryin’ to tickle mah gums!”, you just have to hook it with your special toof!”.  “Speakin of which whattana, whattana, whattana, whattana…. “ Nomes began to stutter and starting pointing off into the distance. After breaking his stutter he exclaims, “Whattana, Whattana, Nomes.  I been fishin for unicorn fish
As a tree branch snapped you could see the  silhouette of a man falling down and screaming “sweet gypsy kite” as the man splashed into the river.  The way he entered the water caused such a loud rockous twelve trees became dragons and flew off. The bellowing of the splash caused Buck and Nomes to fear cannon fire.  Nomes reached for a pebble and places it on his head.  Nomes special ability was camouflage
Buck looked over to where he last seen Nomes and he was very perplexed that the man that was standing there had vanished.  Being heavily distracted from what just happened Buck floated down the river towards the noise with great curiosity.  Buck did not use a paddle to float down the river
“OHHHHHHHH, tall timbering stranger?  And why were up in dat tree up der?” questions Buck.  As Buck was finishing his question ,a box of thin mint girl scout cookies hits Buck in the shoulder.  Miles responded, “I was trying to clear my rear! But, as I bent over the branch snapped and I flew faster than a jack-rabbit on opium.” 
In the midst of deep conversation sounds erupted from the pebbles of the river and mysteriously appeared Nomes Chomper.   Nomes picked up the cookies and said, mouth wide open, trying to understand what Miles meant.
The dusk sky made the scene almost majestic with the way that the leaves fell onto the surface of the river. The approaching darkness became more frightening though when the sound of falling leaves was broken up with the pops and cracks of gun fire off in the distance. Nomes broke the silence by saying “Ya’ll don’t want to head that direction. It ain’t nothin’ but trouble over there. I just came from it, but we gots to be careful ‘cuz of Indians and redcoats got patrols out here.”
They began to gather what little they had on them and headed down the banks of the river to the woman’s house. After a few hundred yards
After walking through the darkness for many hours
Nomes disappeared to the front of this shack for a few short minutes. He came back to the field and gave them the signal to let know that she was alright with harboring them. The two that were in the woods moved swiftly across the field and up to the home. They were greeted by a woman at the door with hair as red as Norwegian crawl-dog munchin’ on sloppy joes. They expressed their gratitude for her generosity
She showed them into the cellar where she insured that they would remain safe and hidden. As they began to settle in, and a sheep so fat it looked like a Puerto Rican mosquito after sucking on Buck’s thumb for the third person. Miles quickly yelled “DIBS!” pointing towards the fluffy sheep. Nomes and Buck agreed that neither wanted to be so selfish so they manned up and decided to share the hay and warm quilt with dancing fairy’s shucking oysters imprinted on it.  Miles unashamedly cuddle up with the sheep. After a few moments of all of them restlessly tossing and turning Nomes unexpectedly cut on the latern put  a pebble on his head and said “ I can’t stop thinking about that beared lady from the carnival screaming  “ I’ll scallop your mustache!” pointing at a sloppily dressed british officer in the middle of the fighting at slip dizzy.”  As Nomes proclaimed this, the three men bursted into laughter and conversation drifted off into the midst of night.

She wouldn’t be my first victim. Abby with her long, was my first. She was six years old and more of a tomboy than my current girl Hannah.

It took two days for the Patrick’s mother to realize what had happened and find the tiny bodies buried in saw dust.

I guess to spare Patrick of the massacre that had taken place his mother decided to dispose of the evidence. I watched in the corner of the cage as she picked up the stiff bodies of my siblings with tissue paper and walked into the bathroom. I couldn’t see what happened; only the blue paint on the wall and his mother’s pedicured blackish-purple toenails. But I heard the plunks of objects being submerged and the harsh swish of water. My mother and I were placed in one cage and my father in another and we were taken back to the store from which we came. 

 While Abby was at school I had escaped. But before I could leave she needed to get what she deserved. I knew her habits: homework, blending in with the brown teddy bears and unicorns which were far more innocent than me. I watched as her mom tucked her in and Abby listened attentively as she was read a princess story. Every young girl loves princesses. 

They long to grow up and find their Prince Charming who will sweep them off their feet and save the day. Well Abby

As her mother left and shut the door and she buried her face in her pillow

“Mom

My little hands struggled to grab her neck. My nails barely broke skin. I thought about biting her nose but before I could she pushed me off of the bed and onto the floor. In her feetie-pajamas she rolled out of bed and stumbled through the dark room towards the door. 

“Mom

The light from a nightlight illuminated her face. I stared her in the eyes as she looked at me

Her mother and father ran into the room. Abby’s eyes were still locked on me as they tried to figure out was wrong. Her father kicked me away and I scurried under a dresser.

 Soon sirens from ambulances filled the house. Abby was assessed and calmed down and after deciding it was only a minor asthma attack she was released and spent the night in her parent’s room protected between her mother and father.

The next morning Abby’s mom searched the room before finding me in the closet. 

“You evil fucking hamster

Someone finally knew my secret

That’s when Hannah came into my life. Her nose pressed up against the glass of my cage in the pet store “Mommy

I suppose Hannah isn’t half bad for a human. She does want me to live a normal life, enjoy myself.  First, she introduced me to Boots. I attempted to have a healthy relationship with Boots. He was a bigger hamster, and all black with a white splotch on his chest. But he was always eating my portion of the food. “Boots, I do not mind sharing my home with you, but I would appreciate it if you would share the food equally,” I explained to him. I have become good at hiding who I really am from the time spent at the pet store as well as the many months spent pretending to be a normal pet.

“Hey,” said Boots. He looked at me and laughed-snorting a little in the process.

 Well,” I said sarcastically. 

“What?” asked Boots.

“Well I was just saying that I had you all wrong Boots. You are a great guy.”

Boots squinted his eyes and shook his head. “What the hell

 “You know what you have done to deserve this Boots

He began to speak but a quick spin on the wheel snapped his neck for Boots and that was the last time he bothered me.

After that there was Delilah. It was exciting to have a woman with me. The companionship was great at first

“I don’t understand why you treat me like this. You never let me in. If you won’t try to make me happy maybe I should find someone who will

It was the same argument every time. “Delilah

“You never say the right things

I was sick of it too. Obviously my expression of emotions wasn’t as mastered as I had though. But she had to go. And when we went for a stroll in our hamster balls- her pink

Hannah is no more threatening than me. Misunderstood sometimes, just as I can’t understand relationships, or trust or love.

I could keep this girl around. Maybe it would be good for me. Every normal hamster wants a child to take care of it. Not a life lived on some store shelf in a crowded cage until you get mean and they isolate you in your own cage. Then you get old and no one will want to love you, but the concept isn’t a pleasant one.

Maybe I can be normal, I’m going to sit here watching Hannah, watching you, as an unsuspected predator.

My free hand reached out ahead, feeling out for the familiar path of branches that had so often guided me this way. Despite having been interrupted by my presence many times, the little life that the woods displayed refused to show any signs of wear, only doing me favours as our tracks were swallowed up the minute we passed through. The short journey always seemed to be way longer among the darkened hours of the clock cycle, although I had never been able to decipher why.

The bird on the wall squawked once. It had flung itself into the stagnant air for a moment, no longer begging for the soft steps for which they had once longed. The door frame was cut and marked to varying degrees, with names and numbers scrawled in caring script. The kitchen was calm, the measured dripping of the faucet's tears had long since dried into apathy. The living room lacked its own eponymous nature, its couches and chairs tired and layered in heavy, gray lethargy. Out front, the pumps were dry and thirsty, a drink inevitably denied by the cracked dirt of the stone well. An old wooden bucket
   
 The silence broke all at once, the sun melted away, unable to compete with the storm. A once great entity reduced to flaming rubble on the horizon, still emitting light, faintly, however unnecessary light happened to be.

It would have been hard to breathe, and with them, the world held its breath.

The cracked dirt drank quickly, the more there was, the less it seemed. The rain stopped as suddenly as it had begun, and the Earth tried to cry, but the tears refused to flow. It feared the rain had forever ended, as it had once breathed in excess, now it craved the winds cool embrace. The sun shone again. This time brighter than before. Had someone cared to look, preparing to sing the hour.

The dry ground had since decayed and warm methane breezes would often flow, and the dust found the inside of the house becoming desert.

Then he looked at Donna once more and smiled. She once more had tears, but this time they were accompanied by a smile. The psychic handed the teddy bear back again, grasping her hands as he did so.
 
Donna walked out of the room, outside the door.

The body had been found in the river. Decay had done its damage already
Donna sat on her couch, though she did tremble slightly, as if the sobs wished to escape. So many times she had heard stories of dramatic rescues and last-second escapes. Nobody publicized stories of defeat. Then again, nobody wanted to talk about it either.
 
It didn’t matter though. Her son was dead.
 
Josh stood at the door, he closed the door, leaning his back against the wooden frame and letting out a soft sigh. Nobody deserved to go through this. And though he hated to see his closest friend hurt, there was nothing he could do to bring her son back.
 
Donna turned as her friend entered the room, resting her head in the crook of his neck. She had always felt safer around Josh, ever since she was little. He had grown to become her surrogate brother in many ways. But today, she felt no comfort. Her son was dead.
 
Josh brought his arm protectively around Donna, and that worried him.
 
“Are you going to be ok?”
 
Donna smiled a bit once more at her friends question. Josh was never one to beat around the bush. And he deserved an honest answer. “I don’t know.”
 
“Life is still worth living. There are still people who care about you.”
 
Donna closed her eyes. “I don’t know if it is

“The last time I saw him, her voice threateningly calm. “I never got to apologize. And I never got to say goodbye.”
 
Josh closed his eyes. He hated his idea. But it was the only way he knew right now how to keep her alive.
 
 
The psychic re-read the same paragraph in his book for the umpteenth time. In his head the news of the boy’s death haunted him. He felt pain
Looking up
 
“I know you lied. I know you are fake.”  Josh’s face stayed neutral
 
The psychic wrung his hands slightly, is this deal?”
 
Josh’s glare deepened
 
 
Donna sat, swaying slightly, and softly spoke. “Mama? Mama, is that you?”
 
Donna’s face lit up,” she breathed, barely able to contain the emotion in her. Color returned to what was previously an almost grey face, and she smiled for the first time in days.
 
Josh turned and shut the door
 
Turning, to help his friend. He hated to lie to her. He hated even more to let the psychic deceive her once again. But he did what he had to do to keep her alive. That was the responsibility that came with being her friend.

Prologue:

Face down. Face down. Not face up. Face down. Didn't scream or anything. Just dropped. Stone cold. I tried to save him

Chapter 1:

2 days earlier…

""The front line?""

""Yep.""

""But we've only been here for a couple days!""

""Well

I couldn't believe it. The front line. The big one. No more wallowing in the reserves
""So
""2 weeks
""Only 2 weeks?""
""Yep. Pack your things.""
Alan was on his bed

Chapter 2:

The front line…
Our ride to the front was uneventful, we were directed to our trenches under an iron sky of guns, grenades and bullets. 
Apparently, then finished him off when he sank to his knees. The charge broke a few moments afterwards, with men running as fast as they could back to their trenches. 
About a quarter of them actually made it back. The rest lay dead or dying in various amounts of pain

Someone told me that the person I shot had been leading the charges for months on end and that we lost lots of men whenever he was at the head of a charge. 
""Now he's gone"", you mark my words!""

Chapter 3:

The next day…
Alan thought that what I'd done was pretty heroic, but he was a hero to the enemy. I'd killed one of their greatest inspirations. If any of those men, in that trench not too far from ours, survived, they would be reduced to emotional wrecks. Not just from losing a great hero, but from the war itself. I'd seen it already, on our side. Veterans walking around, probably trying to remember a happier time, but the sight. The feel. The loss of what you think the world is
""Sam?""
I snapped out of it. I realised I was drooling from lack of concentration. Oh feth
""Sam?"" Alan repeated. I was aware now.
""Yeah
""We're moving up-trench""
""Really? Why?""
""Logistics apparently thought that losses would be much higher
That made a lot of sense. ""How much did Logistics misestimate by?"" I asked.
""Well
I stared at him
These thoughts were at the forefront of my mind as we packed our meagre belongings up and moved up the trench



Final Chapter:

The next day
I was that man
I was the hero that all the other men were inspired by.
I could make them fight with the fury and strength of a million men
Word had already spread to the other trenches. I was Slayer der Götter
 It showed how low morale had been

These men would follow me to hell and back.

Suddenly, I knew I had no choice. I clambered up the trench line with Alan by my side. We were best friends, nothing could stop us.
The few trees in our way provided a little cover from the withering

11.
Then
Face down. Face down. Not face up. Face down. Didn't scream or anything. Just dropped. Stone cold. I tried to save him
My fury was taken to new heights. I grabbed his bayonet from the end of his rifle. I had two in my hands. One to murder and one to avenge. I sprinted the final 10 meters with a war cry on my lips. The men around me did the same.
Then, killing, swinging, screaming, blood, death, stamping. 
I stopped. The men I had killed were strewn about me
And I saw him. Death was 20 years old or so, and didn't flinch when he claimed me.

He sits on a bench with his back to the wall, but so is everyone else. The wall opposite him is made entirely of glass – large panes, fitted together with thin, silver beams, each with a thin strip of clear glue-covered paper applied to the backside. “That stuff could stop a car in its tracks,” he thinks. The panes slant upwards and around the building, creating a dome made entirely of glass. He can see the outside sky – instead of just the stark light that continuously radiates him for the rest of the day. He’s very used to that light, he doesn’t know. He’s always calm. As he looks up

Looking down, longs to go outside. He stops.

“This is gonna be so awk.”

“Why?”

“I dunno. I haven’t talked to Julia in a while. Plus I don’t think I’m gonna be sad enough. And I’m worried it’ll be obvious.”

“Claire it’s fine. None of that matters. We’re just there to signal to her that we care enough about her grief that we’re willing to sacrifice a few hours of our time.”

“Yeah I suppose. I’m just really bad at this stuff.”

I pressed my forehead against the window and watched a cute girl walking her dog. She noticed me staring because traffic was moving so slowly. I mouthed “cute dog” and she smiled. I had no idea if she knew what I was saying.

“Is it bad that I’m bored already?” Claire asked

“Nah

“Yes daddy

“You know I would be.”

“Well I wouldn’t want you to be. Cause at the rate I’m going I’ve probably already peaked. You know me. Live fast

She’s only 20.

“I know

“Too real.”

“I meant it in the least judgmental way possible.”

“I know.”

We finally arrived at the colonial looking home

As I walked in I was reminded of a cocktail party. Groups of people, eyes shut. Claire and I shared a glance. I felt her squeeze my hand sharply. We both turned simultaneously to leave the room. Julia came to greet us and give us hugs, but we didn’t know what to say beyond the basic pleasantries. She related to us that everything still felt like a dream. Apparently her mom passed away out of the blue for no discernible reason. Claire stroked Julia’s hair and gave her a peck on the forehead. Julia thanked us profusely for coming and told us she was going to head upstairs for a bit and would be back soon. I could see that her composure was beginning to crack as she hastened away.

Claire and I continued to explore the house. We came across a table of small cards

“Hey Claire

Claire exploded with laughter and I struggled to contain my own at her reaction. An older gentleman who stood across the room glanced in our direction. We must have looked mortified and he must not have heard my comment because he walked over

“No need to be ashamed. We all respond to grief in our own ways, or laughter.”

I offered him a solemn nod and thanked him for understanding.

“Can we step outside?” asked Claire.

I agreed, watching the massive, flailing shadow and Claire laughed. In the company of anyone else I would’ve felt dumb.

“We should probably go back in at some point and say bye to Julia before we leave

“Yeah.”

“I feel somewhat bad suggesting this

I chuckled to myself. She would.

“Sure. I guess I will out of solidarity. And I guess I’d be pretty miz if you rolled and I didn’t.”

Feeling like a social deviant, like petrichor. I closed my eyes and listened to her breathe to the rhythm of the music. I might have fallen asleep for a short time but the next thing I realized was the molly kicking in. The surfaces where our skins met tingled lightly and the music was much richer than I remembered. Claire’s phone buzzed. She had gotten a text from Julia thanking us for stopping by and apologizing for disappearing for so long. That took care of that.

“You know

I ruminated over her words for a moment.

“I’m not entirely sure I understand the word mature

“Or maybe we’re just like everyone else except honest about our real feelings. Or maybe we’re really comfortable with repressing normal feelings.”

“That’s certainly possible.”

“You know

“I like you a lot too. But we both know it won’t work.”

“Cause we’re too much of the same half. We need to find our other halves a la Plato’s Symposium blah blah blah. Or we’ll get bored quickly. I know. But my statement still stands.”

I impulsively leaned over to kiss her.

“Only because we’re rolling

“Only because we’re rolling

We lost ourselves for god knows how long until Claire broke it off. A single tear rolled down her cheek. I didn’t know why.

“I don’t know why either. Life in confusing. Or maybe it’s just the molly

“Or both.”

“Or both. I’m not sad. At least I don’t think so.”

My eyes started watering as well. Inexplicably. Or perhaps out of empathy.

“I’m not sad either. Maybe we’ve forgotten how to be sad but our tear ducts haven’t.”

“Yeah. Tear ducts sounds so biological though. Let’s go with hearts. Our hearts haven’t forgotten.”

“Our strawberry hearts?”

She laughed.

“Strawberry hearts forever

And we were happy again

_________________

The sun beat down on the dry land

A long time passed.  

Eventually a far
Jedediah shifted uncomfortably in his seat and flicked his cigarette butt out the window of the jeep.  His eyes, Jedediah was beginning to reconsider the job offer that he had jumped at just a few short years ago.  What had promised adventure and danger had become merely one long and tedious journey after another, and they were only getting longer.  At 26, he had already seen more than most members of the commune would in their entire lives.  Not that they were missing much, as far as Jedediah was concerned.  It was just wasteland as far as you cared to go.  Still, he couldn’t deny that he treasured this freedom.  It was boring as hell, sure, none of them narrow-eyed shopkeepers or stupid old men with their stupid talk.  The wastes alone were his master.  The long empty miles gave him a sense of momentum in his life
Yet it was this distant and long-forgotten past that the people of the commune were utterly and completely dependent upon.  Scattered throughout the wastes were isolated vaults buried within the earth.  Their dark steel depths betrayed little about their unknown creators, and the power and sophistication surely wielded by their creators.  

They defied the land, lacking any other defining feature upon which to settle, inevitably grew their towns upon the ancient relics which protruded from the surrounding plain.  

 Shapaw, Apette and Illicagh, were rumored to have starved or fallen to some other similarly horrific fate, as no news had reached Shapaw of either in quite some time.  Even Shapaw, the largest of the communes, contained less than five hundred residents.  Some of the others contained scarcely enough people to merit a name at all.  

More than once some crazy band of fools had gone and tried to live inside one of the vaults, had not been touched by human hands for a long, long time.  Their dark tomb-like caverns were usually braved by only the most fearless and curious of souls, who were invariably rewarded with a treasure-trove of strange and useful relics, the most valuable of which was a tiny blue pill.  This pill alone kept the communes alive, for without the medicine within them, the people of the wastes―should they breath so much as a mote of the toxic dust―would be writhing on the ground in minutes.  It was a violent and agonizing death.  All efforts to learn the secrets of the blue pills had failed

As plentiful as the pills were, and so it became necessary to send someone out into the wastes to gather more.  These men became responsible for the resupplying of the pills by way of finding and raiding the surrounding vaults which had not already been robbed of their contents.  

Jedediah checked his compass, and the back of a beat-up old jeep wasn't Jedediah’s idea of a good night’s sleep.  He drove on.  Eventually his thoughts turned to other things: the girl at Begunn’s who was always smiling, his busted generator, the price of the replacement part to fix the damn thing, the―

Jedediah suddenly sat up and squinted.  He threw off his sunglasses and rummaged around in the sack on the passenger seat

 “About time.”

The grey disk that poked out above the earth could mean only one thing: a vault.  As he drew nearer, but then again, why shouldn’t it?  He decelerated to a crawl, then braked and cut the engine.  Double-checking the contents of the sack, he then slung it over his shoulder, and walked towards the embankment which descended towards the entryway.  The ground crunched beneath his boots.  Now that he wasn’t speeding along at 130mph he could smell once more the subtle sickly aroma of the poisonous dust kicked up beneath his feet.  Jedediah slid down the embankment and came to a halt just before the imposing metal hatchway.  He gripped the hot metal handle and pulled.  After several minutes of strenuous effort, a loud clunk came from within, and pushed.  The hatchway swung inward with an eerie quietness into the dark chamber within.  Jedediah took out his torch and lit it.  He stepped inside.  

Immediately he sensed that something was different; something was not right.  Although his eyes could see nothing in the darkness

Jedediah scowled and tightened his grip on the torch.  His right hand moved cautiously to his knife-sheathe, he set off into the dark.  His footsteps made no sound as he moved onward into the chamber.  Nothing but blackness emerged out of the dark, and eventually the open hatchway was nothing more than a pinprick of light in the distance behind him.  Jedediah stopped.  

“HELLO?” he shouted.  A faint echo reverberated around him.

He waited.  Silence.

Suddenly, it stopped.  Jedediah stood very still.

“Hello.” cooed a soft metallic voice.

“Shit!”  Jedediah leaped backward

“I am a Long-Term-Data-Preservation unit.  I have no name.”  Its voice was cool and friendly

He glared at the darkness.  “Jedediah Ackerson.”

“Hello Jedediah.  I have waited a long time to meet you.  I have much to show you.""

The surrounding air slowly became alive with a deep, and Jedediah slammed his eyelids shut.  After several minutes, his eyes began to adjust to the throbbing brightness.  He cautiously blinked open his eyes, and the sight that met his gaze paralyzed him.  His entire body became frozen in shock, as though he had been turned to stone.  In all of Jedediah’s short life, nothing―not even his most radical fantasies―could have prepared him for this sight.  
The breeze―warm and sweet―played across his cheeks.  The blue horizon sparkled in the brilliant sunlight

The Bloop...

That’s what it was called at the time, after reviewing the audio several times, it did kinda sound like a bloop. The kinda noise when a large volume of water is displaced all at once. We were lucky on that one, or unlucky. Maybe if we had recognized it for what it was…

I’m getting ahead of myself.

I believe it was the Olmecs that first encountered the phenomena around 1831 BCE. There’s this monument, showing a young lord or demi god, holding up a ceremonial bar. The general consensus is that it was a figure meant to be establishing the center of the universe. What little we can translate of their culture and writing, the statue was placed at a location that they viewed as being a place of powerful energy. Maybe they saw something in the hills between those two volcanoes. Something that defied nature. There’s no fossil or archeological evidence, but it just fits, you know? By working backwards with the math?

The first recorded incident was February 11th, Mongol rulers of their captured Arabian lands, weren’t too keen on writing down things that didn’t involve the glory of the Mongol empire. What can be gleaned from the entire TWO historical documents concerning the event, was a massive shockwave tipped over several ships on the river, as well as toppling dozens of homes within the city. The writings from the era said that a pressure wave, described by them as “the air punched at our chests as if a forceful man ” , originating from the desert sands east of the city. I calculate the epicenter to have been 1 mile east north east of the cities’ harbor, somewhat less than the destructive threshold of the atomic warhead dropped on Hiroshima by the United States during World War 2. The effects of being so close to a blast of that magnitude would have been similar to what was described by the accounts. I can consequently see why no one cared. It was not a great era of scientific curiosity. It was written off like any myriad of events during that era.

The second recorded event occurred on June 30th, Russia. I’m sure you’ve heard of that one, though. What’s more commonly known as, The Tunguska Blast. Up until last month, it was easily attributed to a rogue asteroid or cometoid exploding in mid air over the deserted forest. Official estimates vary, but the explosive force rattled windows 400 miles away. It hammered the Siberian wilds with what we now know was around 2 megatons of explosive force. Speculation was, that had such an event occurred in a populated city in that era, Paris, very few people were injured. Hell it took months for a study team to even venture out into the frozen woodlands to survey the damage back then. Again

My situation doesn’t seem to make sense, as it seems nothing is operating and no one is working. Quickly, the stood up on my feet but felt as though I would fall a second later, but with enough effort I reached the bathroom. In the view of the dark room, I can see myself through the filthy mirror. It reflected an image of a ghostly pale man with a beard. I could not conclude anything just yet

I opened the door at the exit and felt an eerie gust of wind blow at my face. The polluted smell of dead bodies came rushing through my nose, I felt a harsh pressure hit my chest and fell to the ground without much effort.

I opened my eyes to look at the empty world. Then, she told me her name was Anne; she looked familiar but seemed to be in dangerous condition. The massive amount of lipstick on her mouth contrasted with paleness. After an aggressive set of dry coughs, I managed to agree to travel with her.

Roughly thirty meters in, Oleg once again silently cursed his miniscule light. He had long since holstered his pistol, giving up hope of finding even a single rat in these stygian depths. Looking to his right, he could see that the same corridor continued for at least another fifteen meters. Beyond that, his light could tell him nothing. Turning to his left, Oleg froze. Something was wrong with this darkness. He felt an immediate sense of vertigo, which took some time to reconcile with what his eyes could just barely percieve. As far as he could tell, the corridor *ended.* There was no dead end, and floor



Making no small effort to steady himself, and the penlight they relied on, trained on the opening in front of him. After a moment, he took a step. Then another. After a few moments, which Oleg's furious heart spun into hours, he stood before the opening. The blackness was like a wall--impenetrable, indestructable, and this time could not help but quickly step back from the edge--for he now knew he had been standing on a precipice--of a pit. It had been no illusion that drew him in this direction. The walls, interspersed with rebar like severed tendons from a limb jutted out over the edge. 



Oleg slowly knelt, which had eroded away from the ruined floor over the decades, resulting in the drop he saw before him. With this new information, Oleg calculated that it was only a drop of about three-quarters of a meter. His previous fear almost forgotten, Oleg re-holstered his pistol, clutched his sweaty penlight between his teeth, and lowered himself over the precipice, his weight causing the slope to crumble further. He slid for a moment before planting his feet and retrieving his light from his mouth. Not wanting to move any further before seeing what lay before him, Oleg turned to further explore this new area and froze for the third time. Once again, the formation of which had been caused by the same event that shattered the concrete and rebar of the corridor. Pointing his light straight up



It was several minutes before he realized that his boots were making an entirely different sound as they impacted the dirt than when he had first entered the cave. Where the cave floor had been slightly softened with loose dust and dirt, noticing that it left hardly any print at all in the thin layer of loose, dry dirt coating the hard-packed earth underneath. This was entirely odd. The cave showed every sign of having been created recently, as the result of the same seismic activity that had severely damaged the complex far behind him. However, this kind of packed strata suggested immense pressure, some great weight bearing down. Oleg stopped in his tracks, stomping down hard on the packed earth from time to time and noting the echo it produced. Trying to determine what kind of layering was present in the walls of the cave, watching carefully for a change in its color, now--in a similar shallow depression. This was no cave



Oleg's heart, then who...what had made it? How was such a thing even possible? Oleg's legs began to tremble, but as he tried to calm himself (a vain effort) he realized that it was not his body trembling, but a growing tremor in the earth itself; a vibrating that was becoming more and more pronounced. Oleg spun wildly, in a panic, casting his light jerkily along tunnels walls that now showed signs of trembling, a slight crumbling. 



Then there was the sound. It was the unrelenting, shaking Oleg to the smallest cells in his body. His very mind seemed to disintegrate under the force of that rumbling howl of what he was sure had once bored these tunnels. How? How? he thought feverishly, as if to echo that loathsome sound. How could this be? How could this be? An orange glow lit the depths of the tunnel before him, as if the roar of this creature, this monstrous worm had set the stale tunnel air ablaze. The earth shook as if pounded by hammers the size of galaxies. For a moment, Oleg was utterly paralyzed, simply staring into its dozens of fiery eyes. His penlight dropped, to the ground. Then it was upon him

He still remembered how the strong timber of the Louisville Slugger felt in his palm. He remembered the special grip he had practiced for it. He remembered the first time he learned what he could do with just  his thick arm muscles and a flick of the wrist, the swelling of excitement whenever he approached home plate.

Part of him knew those days were long passed, feeling how much different it felt then he remembered. He had been told the wiffleball bat would be smaller then he was used to from when he was young, but he didn't want to believe it. 

When he felt he was ready, making the ball go where ever he wanted, however he wanted. When she saw him wielding the thick, heavy wooden bat, when she felt the joy and pleasure it gave her to see him in control, that is what made her fall in love with him. He knew these things to be true.

He waited for the pitcher to do his part. The ball came to him fast, then embarrassment. He hid his shame and anger behind a joke, a teasing shrug, as he eyed the crowd again for his wife. She smiled at him, caring but he could read how deflated she was. He clearly saw the grin on her lips; as plastic as it was supportive. He looked up, and through his smile his eyes pleaded: ""I don't know what happened. But it won't happen again. Trust me."" 

He told himself it wasn't his fault. That it was the bat, his distain expressing itself through his jokes. His smile as hollow as the bat he was carrying. He did what he could to shake it off. It was perfectly natural and happened to everybody at some point, but still a haunting, cold knot was growing in his stomach. A worry was growing, festering under the surface of his mind. He swallowed hard to ignore it, tried again, swung and missed.

He didn't joke. He wasn't angry. And he didn't look around at first. He couldn't blame the ball, and if he wasn't bat-swinger, the star hitter, the man who could knock it out of the park every night, then what was he? Was he even a man at all? He didn't know, and he didn't want to find out. He wanted to hide. He felt shame. He felt ashamed and enraged at himself for making himself ashamed and he wished desperately his shame wasn't a public shame.

Again he looked to his wife. He tried to read the look on her face, and his heart sank when he could see a hint of a blush. She was ashamed of him, he knew she was, and he couldn't blame her. Her friends would ask how she was doing, and she would tell him. They would discuss his failure with the sly, cool detachment that they discussed everything else. She would laugh with her friends in an amused, ironic way then, and he wished more then anything she didn't have to see him like this.

He stood frozen in his own thoughts, he didn't want to try again. He wanted to curl up for a long time by himself. Suddenly he thought of his father. He knew his Father would be ashamed of him too. He knew his father would already have made it all around the bases by now. His father would have made everybody cheer. His father would have made his wife happy.

The crowd was turning sour. They had been whipped into a frenzy and demanded satisfaction. The pleas to continue had become stern shouts to finish his turn at bat, but he knew what was expected of him. He went through the same motions he always did. He did his part; the thing that defined him. The little dances that made him what he was, even though he was still doubting his own abilities. He lifted the soft bat in his hands, his fingers wrapped around it, hoping that maybe a new stance or trick would suddenly turn him back into the man he was before. He swung, he missed.

He expected boos from the crowd. He expected not to be allowed back into the safety of the dugout. As he left home plate, like it was somehow attached to him. When he looked up, he looked for his wife, only to see her giggling as she spoke to her friend's nephew. She smiled at the 19 year old college football player, her lips pulled back as she softly squeezed his arm. The younger man, for his part, all buffed chest and bravado seemed excited by the attention. She didn't look back at him the entire trip to the little chain-link trench where his teammates were.

He sat down in a slump, were all very polite, and friendly. The fear he had of their disapproval disappeared. They told him they understood. It had been a long time, after all, and that it happens to everyone, sometimes. They didn't reject him, they accepted him. They had something they could commiserate over.

   ""That one was a little high""

   ""Yes sir""

   That rifle had a hell of a kick. I rubbed my shoulder to try and comfort my bones as they screamed in protest. My step father had promised to take me hunting but now i was having second thoughts. 

   His name is John David Adams Senior. He has been married to my mom for the last two years. It wasn’t strange to me, although he can be very strict at times.

  We got up from the old wooden bench set up on the outskirts of a field about two hundred yards from our camp

  The crisp mid-December air felt amazing, and was replaced by the sweet aroma of freshly cut grass.

  As we reached the target, and we had a whole case of bullets to go through. As we walked back to the bench I rubbed my arm again, apologizing for the pain that was to come.

  Fifteen shots and a short ride later we arrived back at the camp to plan out my first hunt. Our camp was an old house in Natchez, but from the inside it wasn’t half bad. 

  As we walk through the front door into the living room I pass the huge map of the property that is used to show everyone where we would be the following day. “You see that spot there

  I replied “Yes sir.”

  “That’s where we will be tomorrow.”

  I woke the next morning to the sound of the alarm screeching like a fire engine alerting us to a new day. My bed was a sanctuary

  As i pulled on my gear i glance at the clock and realize it is only four in the morning. That explains the iron gates that had replaced my eyelids constantly trying to slam shut.


  The ride to the stand was dark and quiet. Not in a frightening way though. it put me in a calm and comfortable mood. I could almost feel the forest surrounding me waiting for the sun to rise and give light to the new day

  We parked on the road and walked to the stand, hidden behind a curtain of foliage, is my prey awaiting its fate.

  There are two chairs in the stand

  As the sun slowly rose to its seat in the sky

  An hour or two goes by with no luck. My nose is starting to freeze when Mr. John taps me on the shoulder and points towards the field I was looking at. I didn’t see anything though

  Slowly

  My heart is leaping out of my chest

  “Breathe out and squeeze


  As the air escapes my lungs I slowly squeeze the trigger and ready myself for the impact. The world seems to slow down and disappear

  Inside the scope that became my entire universe in that half a second, and in the very center of the field, lying still and lifeless, i see my target.

  We left the stand to see how I did. As we come upon the animal i feel pride for what I had accomplished and sorrow for the animal

  “Beautiful shot,” He said, smiling at me.

  In that moment i am happier that i have ever been, that for once in my life someone was proud of me. 

  I looked into those eyes and saw the pride radiating from them

 I love you

I've been doing online collaboration with other musicians for a while now through /r/redditjams (now defunct) and /r/musicinthemaking. Essentially the process is that someone writes a piece of music and uploads it to Soundcloud for public download

There's an idea I had recently that involved the idea of ""Sound books"" but I think it is currently too difficult and costly to implement in my current state. So I turn to the wonderful internet with this idea and ask you all if you'd be interested in offering your stories to music. It could be a very terrible idea mostly due to timing problems

So would any of you be interested in combining forces with musicians

If the idea is enticing enough I can create a subreddit for it so let me know. I have not yet asked the musicians side of this.",,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jbgd4/meta_any_interest_in_collaborating_with_musicians/

Down towards the bottom

Down towards the bottom

Down towards the bottom

Down towards the bottom, whether it be something simple (A plush animal) or something harsh (A husband gone away).

Down towards the bottom, reminded of their old days.

Down towards the bottom

Down towards the bottom, saving the child from infection, as her husband served her nation.

Down towards the bottom

Down towards the bottom, grabs the man's suit. The man, as his coattails are pulled, stands up and puts the girl on his shoulder. They hitch a ride on a stray beam of light and it carries them upwards.

Down towards the bottom, she says. I know, says the man.

Down towards the bottom, but for now they rest down towards the bottom, into the deep.

Hi

I'm MoodyAtom. This is my first time posting in this sub.

I want to tell you a little bit about this story. It is a more story-driven approach to a lecture I was given by my psychologist. I have had depression for most of my life, it does get better. The theme is based on the Pearl Jam song ""Deep"" from their album ""Ten"".

Also, have always said I'm a good writer, but I would like input from actual writers. 

Thank you!

1374711629.0,1izsq5,Case Insensitive,jonrules,4,1,0,"Larry and I were shelving a shipment of medieval fantasy costumes when the lemmings came. The last television season had brought with it a plague of dragons and warlocks and kings and queens and slutty princesses... a big heap of generic Halloween products spawned by the popularity of dark-age soap operas. I noticed the soldiers first: three men standing roughly 5 foot 11, which had a weird way of making their deep-set round eyes seem proportional.  Each soldier wore what appeared to be a hand-knitted holiday sweater repurposed to look like an armored breastplate. In the center of the chest was stitched a typical large black clover design that one could find in any deck of playing cards. They all had skin-tight swimmer's caps covering their heads and wrapping their faces

""Don't move."" The soldiers had very real steel-tipped spears pointed at our throats. 

""Take whatever you want, the mall contained several jewelry stores and electronics boutiques that would provide a much bigger payout than this shithole. 

""Shut up, but there was no bodily movement other than his lips: no head cocking, no finger no-no, nothing. There was something absolutely off-putting about the way this creature communicated.

Larry did not take kindly to this command: “Oh, but rather a whole keg. The joke was unfunny every time he said it. As far as looks go, Larry was a redneck stereotype, but he described himself as a dirty commie bastard. Larry walked up like a gangsta and slugged that mouthy son of a bitch square in the kisser. I cheered from the sidlelines: “Ohhhhh shit!” I thought that big doofus was down for sure, but the soldier did not flinch. Larry played it off with a heavy breathing sequence. He grabbed the end of the spear and jerked it around a little. “I’ll shove that stick up your ass. I bet you’d like that, wouldn’t you, Cracker Bitch?” 

The soldier replied gruffly with an angry inflection: ""You better check yourself before you wreck yourself."" He held the spear loosely while he said this

""Step up, swooping in and flaring his wings for the death strike. “Make a move, Bro!” I held my breath as Larry placed his face within an inch of his prey.

""Let me apologize for the rudeness of my colleagues, trailing the soldiers. This one was short, around 4 feet, yet quite proportional, not like a midget save for height. ""Skylar, Larry, I would like to introduce my associate, if you'd like."" Buzz was like the soldiers. He had the same look and the same mannerisms about him. The short man continued, I was not going to say a black joke. And I am black.

The store was empty of customers most days. I would be surprised if we were making any profit whatsoever. It was these facts that drew our supervisor

""Where do y'all keep the big boy costumes?"" The talky soldier now had a delightful southern twang to his accent. Carol chuckled pathetically. 

Buzz chimed in: ""What Bobby really needs is a pair of big boy undees."" 

On cue

""Carol!"" I did not know how to properly communicate the situation to Carol

Carol: ""I need these stocked before close today

Another soldier cut in: My wife is named Carol. Is that short for Caroline?

Carol had a fake grin on her face: ""Yes! It's my grandmother's name.""

The soldier continued: ""A pretty name for a pretty lady."" 

Carol chuckled nervously. ""Right this way

The moment she turned around, the soldiers stabbed every inch of Carol's soft flesh like a pincushion. Larry immediately dropped his empty wallet at their feet. ""My bad, Dawg, I ain't trying to hide nothing."" I guess, in the heat of the moment, he had forgotten that spears are effective killing weapons.

In the next moment

My mother used to tell me that the lemmings would take me away if I didn't behave. The lemmings had allowed us, partially out of spite and partially out of curiosity.

I could hear Larry mumbling under his breath. “I’m gonna rip a hole in that nigga's sack...” The dude was steaming.

Me: “Larry

Larry: ""Shut up

By our unfortunate choice of costumes, fat people, all ye olde mall folk passing us by, chuckling under their hands and trying not to make eye contact. 

A security guard approached our party. ""How are y'all doing tonight?""

Jayquon: ""Just fine

Security guard: ""I'm going to need you to stop here for a minute

The radio chimed and a voice responded: ""I see them.""

Security guard: ""You can't be out here on mall property without a permit

Buzz replied: ""Yes, can you believe that?""

Security guard: ""Yeah

Buzz: ""My son lives in Wisconsin. They're getting 3 feet of snow today.""

Security guard: ”Boy, if you don't like the weather today, wait until tomorrow!"" Both Buzz and the security guard had a hearty laugh at that comment.

Buzz: ""It's not so much the heat

Security guard: ""Yessir. Maybe we'll get some relief from this energy shortage.""

Buzz: ”In this economy?”

Security guard: ”Your tax dollars at work

""I hear that

Security guard: ""Alright

We walked for what seemed like days. I had never noticed how ginormous the mall was before. Contemplating your imminent demise really puts these moments in perspective. “You all go on without out me. I’ll stay here.” Jayquon signaled to Buzz and entered a small book store. The soldiers followed Jayquon. I think back to all the opportunities we had to escape. We weren’t bound with ropes, the soldiers had left us and only Buzz remained. We shut up and followed orders, instead.

We approached the exit near closing time, dragging herself across the floor and leaving a trail like a slug. This was an animal that smelled like shit and looked the part. Her big eyes were bloodshot and black bile oozed through her teeth. Buzz produced a club and proceeded to beat the shit out of her until she let go. The thuds were so powerful I thought Buzz would break that bitch in half. She screamed like she would explode from the pain, that sort of high-pitched sound that rattles you on the inside and shoots your adrenaline beyond 100%. I flinched every time the club smashed into her body. “WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? WHY?!” She yelled at Buzz like he had betrayed her.

""Let go

Did Buzz always have that club? I don’t remember. He stood in front of us

We must have ran 300 miles per hour, soaring through the air like god damn antelopes. We stopped on the other side. Buzz carefully examined the horizon, reached down, then pulled up the curtain of the world in front of us. It all made sense. This transdimensional barrier was here all along, we just had to lift it up! The world on the other side had a vivid hue of orange dusk unlike any color I had ever seen. There were prairie plants and small grasses over the hills, and there were no insects to be seen. 

Larry hesitated. Something was wrong. “Shh, another witch was gnawing on a lemming. The girl’s legs and arms were torn to shreds and the witch was licking sap from the remaining stubs. Buzz held up the curtain, “Let’s go!” I stared at him as the girl cried softly while being eaten alive. “You take care of it.” Buzz handed me the club and I stood over the witch. I cocked it back and dropped the club on the back of her head as hard as I could. Before I knew it, I lost my footing and the witch was standing tall over me as I cowered on my back. Buzz had made it look so easy. The club bounced off her head, causing no damage, as if her skin was made of thick rubber. 

The witch stared at me with a look of disgust. “Would it be alright with you if I perform my rightful duty in peace?” I thought about the question in silence, “I was trying to help you, you honky bitch.” I never did finish the “honky bitch” part of my sentence, because the girl talked over me. “Did I ask for your help?” The witch picked up what remained of a leg. “May I continue?” I did not care for the obvious sarcasm nor the tone of her voice. I returned the club to Buzz, feeling humiliated. The crying continued much louder than before, “Oh the pain!” The witch and the girl giggled as I turned my back on them.

“Wait! Don’t go! For the love of pete do not go in there!” Jayquon was running like a hellion towards the cliff. 

I called to Buzz: “Wait

Buzz seemed oblivious to Jayquon’s warning. “They’re lesbians.” 

Me: “Jayquon says don’t go in there!”

Buzz: “I think he means don’t go in there

I tried to plead with Buzz: “No

Larry approached the cliff to confirm the instructions: “Jayquon! Do you mean don’t go through the portal or don’t go into the pit?” 

“The portal! THE PORTAL!” Jayquon yelled out in desperation as he hopped up and down.

Larry relayed the message: “He said the portal

“Alright

“NO!” Jayquon leapt from the cliff and fell short. His body splashed upon the earth below. 

Buzz grabbed Larry and I by the neck and shoved us into the new world. The view was stunning. “Holy shit.” That was what Larry kept repeating. We stood there for hours admiring the spectacle.

“Are you two fags done jerking each other off?” Buzz was standing behind us. 

Jayquon spoke as he flipped through a periodical: “Nice to see you

I responded reflexively: “Nice to see you

Jayquon: “Why would it be nice to see me? I kidnapped you and forced you to come here.”

Larry whispered to me: “This is creepy

Larry: “How do we get out of here?” There was no response to Larry’s question.

Me: “Why did you tell us not to come in here?”

Jayquon: “Obviously

Buzz scoffed: “I tried to tell those idiots.”

Jayquon: “I meant to say don’t fall into the pit.”

	I go home and my mother calls me names that no longer affect me. So she leaves physical bruises that no longer make me cry. When my father makes it home he adds to the bruises and the cuts.

A small but courageous child enters a restroom and hears the distinct sound of expletives and running water.  Two men are standing there.  One, and mutters constantly about the ""fucking fucks out to kill him.""  The other, physically aged around 50, uses the urinal placed conveniently in front of him to block out all knowledge that there is a man beside him washing away either his sins or his sanity.  Given the entrance of the child, one would hope that the muttering man might halt his fearful utterances to protect the ears of the unworthy and unprepared, but he continues his rant.  One might also pray that the suddenly cautious and unsocial child might back away from this conversation of insanity.  He does not, and moves quickly past them into the bathroom stall.  This is much to the dismay of both the fifty year old man and the urinal.  
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The boy hums the tune to his favorite television series as he allows the urine to escape the dark depths of his body and bathe within the thin fluorescent lighting of the bathroom.  Barely realizing that it is free at last

-------------------------------------------------------------------
The fifty year old man, and he almost forgets to fear for the child situated nearby.  The urinal begins to beckon to the physically aged gentleman again, but he resists the comfort its gleaming, porcelain surface offers.  He begins to ask again, but only a breath of air escapes as the cleanly shaven head of the twenty-six year old man turns toward him and becomes furrowed.  His dark blue eyes pierce into the fifty year old man’s mind.  The silence deafens the occupants of the restroom.  The tune of the child has stopped.  The only remaining sound is that of the delusional man's sink.  A family of cockroaches recently made their home in the drainpipes of that sink.  Supposedly able to withstand the power of a nuclear bomb, they now silently drown in the liquid that gave them life.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A toilet flushes in the child's stall, and says goodbye to the two men of the bathroom.  He concludes his restroom adventure by leaving through the same cruel door that allowed the three bathroom occupants entrance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
The two men glance at each other.  The mentally mature man had considered pulling out a small pocket knife and unjustifiably killing the fifty-year old man

The water ran, each drop fighting for its own space in the tub. As her own miniature ocean began to lap at the shore of the bath she returned the faucet to its original position



Taking a deep breath in the tension eased. Tentatively she stepped into the bath, and then calmness washed over her, as the warmth of the water flowed through her. She knew this was what she needed. Her sharp expression smoothed as the water began to calm her, cleansing every part of her being. Giving into the soothing touch of the water she exhaled deeply, breathing out her troubles. Tentatively her mind began to wander, reaching out for a long forgotten moment of bliss to recite endlessly in her thoughts. She painted the scene in her mind, a time without worry or regret



Crystal clear dew drops raced down leaf slops, craving adventure, for the excitement and unknown that waited. The wind rang its fingers through her flowing hair, the flowers outstretched, reaching towards her to be picked up like a small child yearning for their mother. The warm touch of the sun cascaded across the meadow, illuminating every minor element, a moment frozen in time; a moment where nothing at all mattered. It was paradise. However the longer she allowed herself to indulge in the memory the more it distorted, the sky darkened, she was confident in her decision.



She let go. The fight inside her was gone, the storm clouds parting forever. A clang echoed though the bathroom as the cool metal object slipped from her fingertips. The warmth flowed from her, the water around her now tepid and tinged scarlet. Her body was distressed and drained from the battle she had fought. Fought within her, a war which could not be won or lost, for the fight was with her. Water began to fill her lungs, but do not be fooled she was not drowning, for at last

In the distance were the snow capped peaks of the Andes, also reflecting the brilliance of June's supermoon.   I saw constellations I've always read about but never seen: the Crab, Pegasus and his Great Square--even Orion was here!  I didn't expect to see him in the Southern Hemisphere!  The Big Dipper, low on the horizon and upside down, pointing towards home.  And Cruz, but it's as big as the promise

I could've stood mesmerized there for hours

I walked up a lonely trail to the restroom.  My experience with the free restrooms on the trail was that they were nasty.  This one proved to be no exception.  I open the door and look in.  There's shit all over the floor, being as careful as I can not to let my hiking pants touch the turdy tile floor.  I squat slightly, with no idea what's going to happen.  I'm afraid it's going to be a drawn out watery affair, and I will have to stay in this tiring squatting position a long time while my insides flush out.   I'm afraid I might slip on the floor, damp with piss and excrement.  I'm afraid I might miss the hole and make the room even more unsanitary.  Was I standing in exactly the right position?

It is essential that nothing is out of place just to ensure that there are no distractions. When things feel right, the perfect playlist fills the airwaves as you begin to prep the rest of the meal, everything needs to be done ahead of time to make sure all cooking times are precise and all components of the meal are ready to plate at the same time. 

The vegetables are cut and ready to be put on the barbecue, the doorbell rings. You don't have time to visit with guests, nor do you have enough food to invite them to stay, the only option is forcing them to go. The mistake has already been made though, the moment you put down the tongs and move toward the door, you have gone too far, past the point of no return so to speak. The door opens and before waiting to hear if they are welcome, they simply sit down and start introducing themselves. No concern for what you were previously doing
You entertain your guest, the radio gets turned up a little louder in an effort to to make their stay less enjoyable, you want to disrupt their stay. In order to be effective. You must turn up the radio so that it becomes uncomfortable, even for yourself. Your entire body aches, nothing seems better than your bed. But, your memory and thoughts of the food you have waiting keep you on track, keep you fighting and pushing, just when you think you could not possibly survive another minute of the throbbing
As quickly as the guest arrived, it hasn't spoiled the wait has made the flavours stronger.
The food goes onto the barbecue and it cooks. While it does, you are ready for an even more intimate evening  with your family after the intrusion of the unwanted guest.
The timer goes off, and the food is ready to be plated. The family has sat down and they are ready for the meal and what lies ahead. 
The first bite is glorious
It's time for dessert, you walk to the door, open it with a smile, basking in the light of the time you have spent with your loved ones. As the door opens, you see the familiar shadow. The guest has returned, they forgot something. It doesn't matter what, they are already in your home. The smells that fill the house have intrigued them, and you give, you promise yourself it won't be long but you know when you wake the guest will be gone and all will be right. As you sleep
Your morning doesn't come though. But their's does, there is a mess to clean up. But it's ok, the meal was worth it, they are happy to wash every dish, clean up every crumb. They will spend the following days talking about that ungrateful guest, talk about the struggle of getting the guest to leave. But, those conversations will end. As the days fade into weeks, then into years, they will talk about its preparation and what it meant. They will remember the chef, they know they were part of something special and lucky to know such a chef

My life had become a mess, never quite right to the plot, but always there and always acting. The stage began to get cluttered and I found myself pushed aside, as if the story was no longer about me, but those around me.

I watched them wander because that’s all they ever did, their presence still felt despite the emptiness of their bodies and mind upon the backdrop of my life.

I stood back and watched as the actors filled up the stage, giggling and playful, but nary cracking a smile upon my wretched lips. A woman, her features mundane, though filled with beauty. She danced her way to me, her face close to mine, before gently placing her lips on mine. She kissed me then

The actors and actresses began to thin, a series of feeling nothing; loneliness. I inched back more and more, until my back leaned against the set. I watched them go, until it was but me on the stage. The audience left their seats and walked away, the actors had gone on to focus on their lives, no longer a part of mine. The spotlight shone on only me as I walked to the edge of the stage, I whispered my final lines and leapt from the stage, all I could think was that I was a fool for praying.

Snapped back to the reality of my situation, I swear I did, to ignore it’s calls. Suddenly the realization that vast emptiness was better than the sickening loneliness I felt began to tear me apart. I stood up, not bothering to wipe the sand from all around me. I breathed in deep, scared but knowing it’d all be over soon. Strangely, as I began to walk into the water, a smile broke the static in my face for the first time in weeks. I smiled as the water reached my neck, the smile stayed upon my face,False,
1369957335.0,1fdcy7,"This is my first ever shot at a short story. It's called ""The Missed Chance"".",mtm137nd,5,1,2,"Jack stood underneath the dripping wet, and the first real love of his life.  Nine years ago

Jack waited in the rainy weather for 15 minutes before his bus finally arrived.  To him, and the last eight years had filled with very little thought of her.  He had moved on, he was certain of that, but now that she was brought back into his mind, he began to reminisce on the six great years that he had spent with her.  It didn’t end like he had hoped, and things were never fixed between the two of them, but that was okay.  He accepted the fact that she wasn’t the one, but it all came flooding back now. 

At the bus stop, even the times they would sneak away behind Rachel’s dorm to umm, “talk”.  But the arrival of the bus broke his daze, and when he sat down and the bus began moving again, he remembered why he and Rachel ended the way they did.  They fought, they yelled, they disagreed, they snuck around behind each other’s backs, and had begun dating in right before graduation.  Jack had always thought that the happiness that they felt when they were alone, that she decided to skip out on the trip to Jack’s home for Thanksgiving

The final breaking point came a little more than a year after the two had graduated from college.  Jack went on a trip to Prague with some of his pals from Law School, and Jack found out.  Jack didn’t mention it for quite some time, but when Rachel yelled at Jack for not letting her go out on a Friday night, Jack brought up the clubbing.  Rachel, frustrated, stormed out of their apartment, and never moved back.  A week later, and asked him to bring her her clothes.  A week after that, it makes him miserable.  Jack only remembers the end

As time passed, Rachel called Jack.  She was two months pregnant, and she was keeping the baby.  Rachel told him that she was sorry, but it was something she had to do at the time.  The father was just some random guy Rachel met at a party, and the fact that Rachel, the girl who Jack stole the virginity of, and whom did the same to him, but she asked for it.  She told him she knew she was wrong

This was nine years ago, or how it ended. But he couldn’t avoid it anymore, and he had to face the things that had scared him.  Jack never met the baby, but he had learned his name.  Jonathan.  He always found it funny that she named it something similar to his name, but his name was Jack, so he never felt like it was really named after him.  Jack ran into one of Rachel’s friends a few years back and learned that she never married, she never even told anyone, who the father was.  Jack felt urged to ask about the alleged party that Rachel had met this guy at, and refused to go out.  Oddly enough

Jack never contacted Rachel after that night where she told him he was pregnant.  He once received a Christmas card from Rachel and Jonathan, he would be meeting the kid.  For some reason, he wanted Jonathan to like him, he didn’t know why, but he did. 

Before Jack knew it, and then reached the building that he was supposed to enter.  He double checked the address one more time, he had it right.  Jack tightened his silk, black tie, put his phone in his jacket pocket, and entered.  The minute he entered, his heart sank.  Jack began to cry, the pregnancy, tender, and did everything he could to keep himself composed.  

Jack walked with a slow pace, he stopped walking.  He didn’t say a word.  Jack stared at Rachel for a few seconds, and then gently kissed her on the forehead.  Immediately afterwards, while still feeling the tickle in his throat that made him want to cry, he placed the rose down softly inside the casket.  “Goodbye Rachel, I will always remember you” were the only words he muttered before walking away.  

Jack couldn’t bear to stay longer to talk to Rachel’s family, a slim, blonde haired, nine year old boy walked out.  “This is Jonathan” Rachel’s mom said slowly, “he’s been waiting to meet you”.

The rest of the mob saw his action as one of leadership and followed suit. Before long stones, bottles and anything else within reach was flung. These objects battered their targets like a hailstorm. The already broken SWAT and police force crumbled under this barrage. The few men who had chosen to remain in uniform began to route in the presence of this violent and seemingly innumerable crowd.
 A few of D.C.’s finest attempted to hold their ground by any means necessary. At first they used pepper spray and tear gas; as the crowd continued to advance they used their riot shields and clubs; still the crowd advanced and the remaining forces opened fire with their weapons. However
A lone official remained in his office. Congressman Pace. He had been elected to his fourth term in the last election. He was a Representative from Georgia who had one of the highest approval ratings in the House. He sat in his chair
A gunshot sounded from out the Congressman’s office and still he did not flinch. His door burst down suddenly as three rioters pushed a Secret Service agent through it. They beat him with pipes until his cries ceased. The rioters stopped for a moment in the office. All the former Congressman could think of was how they had been too late to see the view. Darkness had now descended. 
“Tyrant!” one of the rioters screamed through his bandana. He leaped over a table seeking his prey. Congressman Pace lay as

The White House was besieged as the President was flown out to an undisclosed location somewhere in the Midwest.

A mob cheered as they watched flames engulf the White House for a second time in the nation’s history. 
The destruction of the National Archives was made into a spectacle. Documents including the Constitution and Declaration of Independence were read before the crowd. Each word, was now being twisted to reveal ironic and biting meanings. The reader sneered at the end of every sentence but did not add his own interjections. The crowed jeered and booed the words.

	“Sure I can” Billy claims
	Billy has always been the best shot in the neighborhood, a marble sized rock awaited blastoff.
 He was ready when “Billy Ray!” came  from their trailer down the road. “coming mom!” he stood up
	“Told ya’ so” Tommy smirks.
	“Didn’t count” Billy whines.
	Running side by side back to their trailer these two brothers have the iconic “Did not”
	Billy and Tommy sit in the back of the trailer where a limestone table is surrounded by a blue stained booth. Rust peppers the sides of the oversized van, the sink is full of small insects and dirty dishes. It has a back bed room where the mother and whomever else she brings home stays. The two bunk-beds outside the room are for the boys, but the mom doesn’t want the boys to stay there. The mom tricks for a living, so she bought them a tent the boys set up a couple hundred yards into the forest. 
	“Meatloaf and corn on the cob, but in rural Tennessee prostitution in the trailer parks is her only bargaining chip. Billy is big for his age, at 11 he towers at 5’6 and weighs 130 pounds. He is a pale boy with greasy blonde hair always molded under a Boston Bruins baseball cap. He can’t even tell ya’ where Boston is, but he found the hat in the trunk of an old Mustang in the Junkyard. He tells his friends it stands for Billy and with his temper, no one ever questions it.
Tommy is thirteen years old and stands 5’3 108 pounds. The mother tells the boys they have the same father and that he was off fighting in the war. Tommy knows his father was black but never brings  it up to his mom
 Billy and Tommy race to wash their plastic plates in the sink. “Race ya’ to the tent!” Tommy pants as he grabs his knapsack and runs out the door.
	“No fair. Mom I wasn’t ready.” Billy cries.
	“Tommy get back here and brush your teeth.” She says as she holds onto the handrail and leans out the door. 
	“Mauuuuum.” Billy says walking head down towards the trailer.
	“Smack” Tommy hit Billy in the arm the second he got into range. Tommy might have been the runt but Billy had a severe case of little brother syndrome. 
	“Now I am going into town tonight. If you need anything go down to Buck’s and you can each spend five dollars. I don’t want y’all coming back to the trailer until the flag is out the window in the morning. Okay?”
	“Okay mom.” the boys say in haunting monotone unison.
	The boys are so used to this routine
	Tommy of course knows how their mom makes her money but wasn’t about the be the one who breaks the “good ole’ mommy illusion” to an eleven year old. 
	“She has friends over. Ever since dad went to war
	“What about us?”
	“Adults are different

The soundtrack of birds and crickets put the boys into a deep sleep. One giant Spider-man sleeping back carpeted the tent. Under blankets and starlight the boys were never bothered.
Until later that morning “ERRRRRRRRRR–VROOOOOM” woke up the boys. Billy and Tommy peeked out of their tent and saw a black Ford Expedition peel out of their drive way.
	“Can we go home?” Billy asks.
	“We have to wait for the flag first.”

Life isn't that hard of a thing to figure out, once you simplify it, all the complications become clear, still complex nonetheless. Its kinda like taking pre-calculus, as opposed to calculus

Me: So, why does it require explaining? If it were as cake as you say, it would just require common sense to understand that nothing is as hard as we make it?

1367725006.0,1dpr63,The Important Package,leewoodlegend,5,2,0,"How had I never noticed how fresh the air here was? I took another deep breath, where I’d sat my important package. Yes


Other, thank you. The blonde serving the drinks had the most marvelous eyes, here blue or there green depending on which way they caught the light. Her hips were meant for children. She was an angel, even if she didn’t remember my name after a week straight of coming here. I saw her pleasant presence as a blessing, a sign that today was the day the seeds of my labors came to fruition.


I moved my hand to the next table and felt the brown paper wrapped around the package, never disturbing the world I’d created within.


When my glass was near empty the lovely barmaid brought me another. A second time. A third time. A fourth. My head was swimming now


I heard the door open and close and I looked up to see the most beautiful creature. She was from southern France, I assure you.


But it was I, plump, and jolly, and ever so slightly past her nineteenth birthday. She was open and honest to a complete stranger, a man she’d never even met. It was as if fate directed her to me, she said.


I was caught between wondering why such a beautiful girl would sit with me and amazement that she was speaking my language so fluently. She was a Spaniard


Before I was even able to open my mouth to tell her my name (and I had to tell her more than once because she kept forgetting it), but he hadn’t always been that way. The death of her mother took a horrible toll on a previously gentle and loving family man, she’d said. She was going to continue north, keep seeing the world until she decided she was ready to settle down.


She didn’t know where or when or with whom


“And how do you know the time is not now?” I asked her.


“Because I know.” She said


“Then why are you here?”


“Because of all the men in this room


She could feel it too. The day itself was smiling on me


“I’m glad to hear you say that


She smiled. I smiled. We smiled and laughed and drank. We toasted to destiny. And then she put her hand on my arm.


She sucked in air. Her eyes went white and wide and wild. When her pupils came back


“Are you okay?” I asked her


She shook me off violently and stood up. “You…what are you? What 
darkness? What evil?” Tears were running down her cheeks. Her breaths came as sobs


“What in Hell are you talking about?” I demanded.


“Murderer!” She cried.


“I’ve never harmed anyone! Anything!”


“You will.” Her sobbing increased. The regular drinkers had first assumed I was harassing the poor girl


The room burst in to laughter. Everyone but me. I took a moment to collect my thoughts as I paid my tab and finished my last pint. I shook off the haunting feeling the young Spaniard had left me with. An anxiety. A pox on my perfect day. By sheer force of will I managed to convince myself to forget the whole thing. She was nothing more than a crazy girl. It might even have been her idea of a funny joke. Best not to dwell on such things.


Especially not on such an important day. I retrieved the package from the seat next to me. This thing was going to change my life. This was the one. No more failures. No more rejections. This was the best painting I’d ever done in my life.


It was mid-autumn in Vienna, I knew that after today nothing would ever be the same.


No one would ever forget my name again.

1367449843.0,1diiq2,A Dream I Had About The Afterlife.,purplestories,4,0,3,"Last night I dreamed that I had died. It wasn't the normal kind of dream. It wasn't the kind of dream that you wake up enthralled
When I died, and that now my dreams were coming true, and I was ascending towards everlasting glory.

There was none of that.

But equally there was no fear. There was no anxiety, contemplating other alternatives to constantly living with the big day forever looming over me. Emotions that had rendered me useless, unable to function, wondering what the fuck we are doing on this planet, and why something as spectacular as life on earth, with its inconceivable beauty and ability to emote human euphoria, could have such a terrifying and mind numbing opposite as death, it is nothing but the absence of life in a previously living body.

No. Instead of fear or euphoria, in a small room, my family surrounding me as I lay in a bed drifting off courtesy of an incurable disease, as so many have done before me, and so many will do after. As I faded I felt my woes fade also. I don't think we realise it when our lives are so busy, but we always have our woes or problems on our mind, we just don't notice them as much. I thought about my family and friends. They held hands and sobbed around my bedside, how they would cope without me, and by this point I had accepted that I would either see them again

And then it happened; though it didn't happen instantly. Throughout life I had always imagined that the moment of death would be similar to an abrupt power-outage, and whatever came next had begun. Those around my bed began to leave the room. They left in an orderly fashion, as if it had previously been decided how they would do so. First, my four best friends. Second my brothers and their wives, my sister, her husband and their children. My grandmother, and finally my mother and father. Each of them did so matter-of-factly, as I'm sure in normal circumstances they would be crying and mourning uncontrollably. Instead, I was alone

It was in this moment that I realised that I was witnessing my death out of body. I was standing in the corner watching this happen, and I began to think that maybe time didn't exist anymore. We talked about the life I had lived on earth, about the relationships I had formed and the feelings I had had, what I had achieved in life, and what mark I had left on the earth. And then I asked myself what was going to happen next, and of course didn't know the answer.

Just as quickly as I had realised what my role was in my own passing over ceremony, and not a single answer. I closed my eyes and breathed in. I took two more, long, similar breaths, and I held the last one. I opened my eyes.
And then I saw everything. Every sunrise and sunset from every possible corner of the earth. Every flower that had ever bloomed, in the sky and in the oceans. Every man who had ever made his dreams come true and every woman who had ever accomplished her greatest feat. Every new-born baby that had ever been born, potential in their eyes. I experienced every sensation that could ever be felt, and heard every note that had ever been played, I tasted success, I smelled hope and in all of these things combined I saw the face of God.

I awoke in my bed and questioned my own existence again. As I write this I am still unaware of what my dream means. I believe that we are more than skin and bones. I believe that our bodies are nothing but vessels, I wonder how many times I will die again, and I wonder whether or not there is some end to this cycle. The only thing we can be sure of is death, for without death there is no life. There cannot be one without the other, but I do not believe that birth is the beginning and death the end. Until it is my time to become knowledgeable of what is next to come, I will just keep dreaming.

What used to be a mirror image was now alive and this creature who used to be a reflection of himself had unveiled its mask and came to reality with its fearful face.

Kosmonaut

Peace. Bleak

I have been circling Earth for months now. I once knew what it was like on the surface. Going day to day, seeing the universe and all of its glory from my minuscule metallic prison, I can see that I was wrong. 

I feel I am a lost sentinel, my prison and my liberation. I cannot be touched by anything, only enlightenment. It is wonderful.

Floating weightlessly through my metal cocoon

I look out the windows, the one facing the sun. Perpetual sun. No setting. No night and no day. Out the other window, I can see into eternity. Every shining star, every galaxy and asteroid, every single speck of glowing space. I can see it all. And it is beautiful. 

I realize my time in heaven is coming to an end. My mission was slated for only a year. That time bled away in an instant. A blink of an eye

Knowing that I will lose my endless bliss is difficult to bear. As I sit and stare through the glass

I am due back home in just a week's time. But there is no home to return to. I have thought long and hard about my life

Bound to my metal prison

I feel a tug as I reach the end of my tether. I detach the clip from my belt.

I am swimming in a sea of emptiness. The stars are all within sight

My angle changes

I can see into space and time. I am falling into oblivion. I can see my space pod drift away from me. All is gone. I am at peace. I am nothing and I am everything. I am eternity. Just before I drift out of sight

He tells me of my deepest desires, of everything I want. He talks about my hair, and my toes. The books I have read and the book I will write. He lives for me only.

He is cold to the touch made of steel. I put him on my back and we go everywhere but yet nowhere at the same time. We run as fast as we can, he brightens up when ever he sees me. He always sees me.

There are promises of silver and garnets, he has seen the past, and he assures me that all will last. He tells me about how fair things could be.

But I know these to be not.
As he is the lying robot.

 You drew a map on a white napkin and told me how there are always more feet than will go into a mile, a turtle perhaps, or a snail. 
 But these were only masks for numbers



 The dew was on the rocks and the tide was out and there were soft things quaking in the horrible light. There is so much death at the edges


 Everything lives at the edges. You frowned at me like a stormcloud. You spoke of ecotones and cusps and crises. I saw your fingers rubbing chalkdust


 I listened while the sun sneaked through your curls and warmed my arms like your hands on a cold morning. I rubbed my board with the pale bitter wax that smells like violins and tobacco and burns if you get it in your eyes. 


 Then I painted you with coconut oil and lemon where we hid behind the big red parasol


 I left you there on the green striped towel with your books and sunglasses



 (I dreamt out there



 The place where the sea and the earth and the air touch, and we were like sisters meeting or like four old lovers, sleeping side by side in a tent with the moon watching, or like both of those things loving each other and jealous at the same time. 


 I have heard of the surf marching forward
 This is a man thing


 We who have lain at the point where the dry becomes the wet know that these are kisses and caresses, we burn, we die and return, whether to earth or sea.



 (Your thoughts were not lost out there



 I hold them in my head when I let the dreams take me



 The thing about edges, you said, and I saw a bead rolling between two widening wires, always about to fall, and somehow never doing it. Always moving forward, and rising and declining imperceptibly, as the world carries it onward.



 Benoit, but you never told me what they mean, unless I was listening to the gulls or the surf or the soft murmur of your pulse beneath my hand. 



The wind shook your blue hat

 Like the birds of wakening



The heartbeat of the world you called it

 The hermit crabs and the robbers


 And the great ghost crabs; the grey and shining grandmothers twitching their long braches like blind man’s sticks through the pebbles toward the tidepools


 They love the sun

 ""Have I told you that the sea is made of blood? It's true; but the blood is stronger now that it was when we left."" 

 I knew you did not mean ourselves



 We swam then



 Under the rusting nod of the lotus pod spigot you turned and turned and lost the scent of our mother the ocean


 Blind, as the earth and the ocean and the sky see you now. As the fire saw you then, lapping lights across your sand dusted hip, limning out our vagrant silhouettes upon the moist earth.



 (I thought I held you that night in the tent



 Beneath their lids your eyes were watching the pale circles of the gulls



 The next day I rode to the top of the break and found a wave waiting; a terrible thing as green and clear and bubbled as the bottom of an antique bottle. 



 And I was up and I was in it and the board was a tongue in the mouth of the ocean

 
 Caught between the air and the sky, until the ocean cast me out and dropped me at your feet, and we showered and you combed out my hair and we had breakfast. 



 (These are the things I remember



 (Still), that I will always live there, on the edge between memory and dream, with the bright birds and the grey skies, turning, rising like the wave, and hanging in that place within your mind, and rising, now. Forever.

1365720549.0,1c61cc,Broken,,6,0,1,"Okay Reddit. First time I'm posting something to an audience outside of my small circle of friends. Hope you like it. I'm from India so you have the references here and there. Shouldn't stop you from getting it

This story formed itself on three separate occasions and was finally written on a cold winter day on a Lutyens' Delhi building's terrace. It became more special after I recited it to someone immediately after its completion. Not very often do I get to read stories out but for the one time I did, but some warmth inside, and just about enough. I hope you like it :)

 

""Do ghosts live on Peepul trees?"" I ask, rather. I warm my numb fingers on it. I am cold. I'm in a village for all practical purposes. My phone does not work here, buffaloes sit lazily basking in the faded sun, children quarrel over a game of marbles, and a twenty-year-old misfit sips tea sitting on a cot.

 

Needless to say, blue glory. Two birds skip off the draft and dive one after the other to swoop onto some unknowing prey. Somewhere, a rooster crows, which is quite odd for two o clock in the afternoon. Also odd for this time of the day is the cold that seeps through to my bones. I tell my aunt about life in the city. She listens wide-eyed. She cannot fathom the coldness of it all, the steel and glass prison that I work in, the dreadful fact that I know exactly how each day is going to be. She does not understand how free I feel here without my cell phone chaining me like an invisible umbilical cord, how clear the air here is without a thousand conversations riding the airwaves form tower to tower. All is well in my world though

 

As the clock strikes four, is the neighbourhood teacher, a prestigious title earned through months of reading aloud the alphabet, teaching children to dot their i's and cross their t's and much red ink spread over her soft palms. The children eye me suspiciously. After a while they decide I'm no threat and a couple of them greet me. ""Good Morning, Sir!"" they say in that sing song chorus I used to be a part of, long back. I smile again.

 

This class is quite different from any I have seen. The children, prized possessions no doubt for those little fingers. It is, in a way, like an overgrown garden. Disordered and chaotic but oh, so beautiful.

 

One little boy stands out, the letters are fractured,misshapen little creatures, and the boy's face is a mixture of confusion and terror. I look at my sister with concern. She nods silently and tells the class to write numeral to a hundred. She walks over to me and looks into his book. Then she looks at me, her eyes full of exasperation and silent despair. ""There's something wrong with him."" she says, the winter haze making its way into her voice. ""He's just slow to learn. He's not too rich. His father was supposed to come see me today."" She looks at him with sadness. He merely smiles as he squints into the sun. ""Take care of him will you?"" she says and leaves me with him.

 

I am now a helpless subject of the boy's scrutiny. he squints at me face, I think. I need something to say, to engage his mind, so much more free than mine. ""Do you like aeroplanes? I ask him , finding my saviour in a flash of supposed brilliance. ""Planes."" he says after a couple of seconds of incomprehension, his face lighting up. ""Planes!"" he says again, his hands tracing a flight path, my fingers using their own memory saved from eons ago when I used to fly. He sits there confused

 

As his small hands struggle to give life to the piece of paper, becoming more and more refined until he makes the final fold with all the grace of a finishing pirouette. As we walk to the boundary I silently pray that it flies well, to some unknown tree-dwelling deity, lord of planes and the winter wind.

The child blows into the paper plane in a ritual he is sure will lend it magical wings

 

And it flies majestically, then diving again and continuing its graceful pirouette as the boy's wide eyes follow it in flight, even as he dives and stalls with the plane, no longer bound by his form, and having lived its short life with the grace of a dying star, the plane lands on a buffalo sitting some distance away. The animal merely grunts and goes promptly back to chewing its cud, a business more important than all the machinations of this world.

 

I look at him. He is laughing. He is in fits. ""You did well."" is all I can muster. I ruffle his hair gleaming brown in the sun, other gestures being foreign to him. He picks the child up into his arms, never too weak for his son. Then he looks at me with a smile and moist eyes. I cannot look away. They are too deep for me to swim away.

My mind goes back five years when I had returned with my examination results to my father. ""You could have done better."" was all he had said. I remember sitting there under the same sun with the result sheep in my hand

I look at the child and his father again. It's not cold anymore. The wind stands still as if in respect

Then it hits me .

The boy isn't broken.

I am.

I walk away silently and gaze across the open fields into infinity until my eyes are moist.

Perhaps it is just the cold wind.

First, that is about what I expected.

I didn't make much of an effort to publicize the story when it was initially posted

""Paradox"" is the story of a man's descent into madness as he struggles to alter the fate of his only daughter.

**WARNING:** This story is bitter and rather dark. There is quite a bit of profanity and it is not suitable for children. You've been warned.

&gt;__________________________________________________

&gt;The Paradox has one rule: Don’t interfere. Don’t be a hero; don’t change the world. Just follow your path. Break that rule

&gt;“Time’s up

&gt;One click and back we go; back to that tiny, and my little girl is lying there with tubes and wires strung across every inch of her fragile little body, and all the while that cocky prick stares back at me dangling that fucking watch over my baby’s head.

&gt;“Tick-Tock

&gt;Her body shudders

&gt;A moment passes

&gt;“Time’s up.” And just like that

&gt;Do you have any idea how hard it is to bury your own child? Try doing it a thousand times.

&gt;It rained that day...always rains during a funeral. It’s almost as if nature isn't content stealing one life and decides to suck it out of everyone else. I don’t move, but after a thousand times, there are no tears, just cold, unadulterated rage.

&gt;So how does a man end up in my situation? My little girl was sick. Cancer. No one knows where it came from; she just woke up one morning and started to die. We tried everything; surgery, we prayed.

&gt;My wife was the soft one. She asked God to intervene and show us His mercy. I didn't have time for that. I didn't ask for anything; I demanded it. My baby was on her death bed

His gaze wandered a little higher to the massive observation window. The curvature could clearly be seen


He had purged a moon six months before. There were riots on the small colony Triton-4, and an expensive one. Luckily the people on the surfaces volunteered for the hard work – at least all the officers told so.


But now he was in doubt. A big fleet of construction ships was hovering near the sun, but could harness the energy and solve all their energy problems.  
Somehow, red-glowing mass.


Their spaceship was built for only one thing: Annihilating surfaces. With a length of 327 meters it carried an arsenal of the most devastating weapons ever created, all of them combined still couldn't match the unique firepower of the Omega.  
It was a tool of peace and stability

And you know what to to, acknowledge my order and purge those surfacemen!"" Captain Benson clenched her fist. ""Commander, now!""

He wandered aimlessly. He didn’t think. Thinking took too much effort. He walked. Just walked
	
His mind trailed off. Where could she be? What could she be doing? When was the last time I saw her? Does she even want to see me? Am I simply just wasting my time? No
	
Nine p.m. she said. We will go to the movies

He approached the pond and walked down the hill till he was on the middle of it. He sat down and looked out across. It was calm except for the ripples caused by the wind. The silence was the best part. Silence was a commodity he longed for. He didn’t need everyone telling him that it would be alright, but what did they know? 

Snow began falling. He and she were heading down the road one night. The winter storms had rolled in and the snow blinded their way as he drove. The tree lined road was interspersed with the occasional home or driveway leading deeper into the woods. The snow was so bad that it was near impossible to see more than twenty feet ahead


 He felt his phone in his pocket and looked at the time: ten-thirty. No missed messages, hate, rage, and longing coursed through him. He didn’t speak immediately. Control was important, nothing good comes from impulse. “Hello my dear. Is it as I fear? Will I still see you here?”


“No my love, like loons, but don’t be mad; I will be beside you soon.” 
	
A consolation time, no ever expected anything from him, so he was never disappointed. He said. “Okay then. It was your time, and never mine but yours to spend. I just thought it was on you that I could depend.”


He let the cold slip in further. His ears went numb, and hugged around him when he sat down. Eleven o’clock his phone said now. Better late than never he thought. Then twelve came around. Then one, and then finally his eyes fell shut and he gave up. 


As the days wore on after the crash he slowly pieced together what happened while in a hospital bed until his memory finally returned and he was able to make sense of everything. Countless faces with sad


It went on until people stopped being nice about it. They started shouting


One day though he received a phone call, don’t fear.” The call ended just after and he was left bewildered but so happy to have heard her. He waited. He waited until nine had become ten and he could take it no more and he had to leave for a walk.


He woke up with hands running through his hair. Cold hands. He looked up and saw her. The smile crept across their faces as they stared. “Hello my love


“Because here my dear, but never darker” 


“But my love you must explain. Why am I in so much pain? Why must you be so delayed?  I have love for you that cannot be swayed


“And one day soon. That will happen for you. Though it may hurt, I will be something you can actually hold. And be far more than Lenore or some forgotten lore. I will be yours.”


And then she was gone. He felt his head. It was still cold. He 
checked his phone and saw no calls. No messages. There was nothing at all. There was nothing at all to ease his mind. So he lay there


For days after he stared at his phone in the hopes that she would call again. The phone though stayed blank with no calls, so he went to join her.

Basil, all twitching ears and tail. With a slight bend to her stubby back legs, she leaped onto my bed and nuzzled her head into my waiting hand. Despite my joy, I frowned slightly at the creaking I heard when she landed; I’d have to ask Marjorie to schedule a service call. 
I’d had Basil for about six months, but the young man explained that P.E.Ts were designed with basic functionality, but each unit would learn and develop unique quirks based on their environment. Just like the dogs I remember from my youth, Basil had a personality all her own. Marjorie and I were terribly fond of her. 

Marjorie, of course. She’d been with me since illness and time had taken away my ability to move about the house on my own.  My mind is still sharp, thank Heaven, but I am not too proud to admit that I would not be able to manage without help. But for all that I appreciate Marjorie, I found myself getting lonely. Basil was the perfect solution. P.E.Ts are wondrous technology, designed to provide companionship without posing the health risks, or requiring the day-to-day maintenance, they came with programs that assisted with managing the sick individual’s care; they dispensed medications at the set times

“Amazing!” I said out loud, and always mite-free, ears. She lolled her perfectly pink tongue in a doggy smile that warmed my heart without spreading bacteria. 

“What was that

“I was just marveling at the things we have these days! I feel so lucky to have lived when I did, my grandparents, could never have imagined such a technological marvel as little Basil.” 

My nurse smiled indulgently, all right?” 

With the skill of a professional, I nodded to Marjorie, who pressed the necessary code in Basil’s remote to initiate the treatment. Hypodermic needles, very thin and very sharp, revealed themselves in Basil’s mouth. Thanks to the numbing agent exuded by Basil’s tongue, I didn’t even feel the needles enter my flesh. A mechanism near the roof of Basil’s mouth began to hum, ever so softly, the optimum timeframe recommended to balance the humors of the human body.

Dr. Francis heard a knock at his door.
""Come in"" he said
A short little man with tiny squinty eyes entered the room. Armed with a gigantic smile and a blatantly recognizable toupee'
""Yes..."" replied Dr. Francis
While the pig-man jabbered on about his tooth aches and his head aches and his back aches, pausing, rewinding what he had been playing, pausing, rewinding for the entire morning.
  
He ate at Le Chateau Imperial. Last night of course. He didn't eat alone. He had company. Somebody very special. Not Darren, was far too busy to go out for dinner with his father, his biological father. He had serious business to take care of, which required most of his time, strength and energy.

""So what should I do?"" asked the pig-man
Silence ate up the room
""Sir? Siiiir?""
Dr. Francis snapped back to reality. He paused the Blu-ray he was playing in his head. He left it there
""Yes, and that he was about to grant the pig-man with a delightful solution to his problems. He told him to sleep more, to go out for walks (in this cold winter weather? What were you thinking Dr. Francis?), to have decent meals, to avoid junk food, and to take painkillers if the pain didn't subside.
 
""Thank you sir, humbly expressing his gratitude, like a plebeian at the feet of his lord.
 
Claire looked amazing last night. She wore a black dress, making her stand out in Le Chateau Imperial. She captured every male eye in the dining room, enveloping them in the black bliss which covered her voluptuous body. She gracefully walked towards Mr. Francis, her ex-husband, who immediately stood up as soon as she approached the table.

The pig-man stood up as well, while jollily shouting: ""See you next time sir, have a good one!""
Dr. Francis was finally alone. Alone with his thoughts. Alone with his paused Blu-ray. He let it play one more time.

He helped her sit down

""Hey honey!"" shouted Melissa.
""Honeeeeey!""
""What do you want?"" shouted back Dr. Francis
""Do you want a coffee? Or maaaybe a cappuccinoooo?"" shouted Melissa with her benign but rather fastidious high rising terminal.
Dr. Francis pictured her sitting on her leather chair, much younger than him. She was in her early twenties, full of life and libido, full of the desire to live, do things, go places.
""I'll have a coffee, and her looong soft legs, sitting there, only a few meters away from him. Only a white glass door with a light brown border separated them.

""Oookay sweetie!"" happily answered the girl
Only a few meters and the door separated them now.
Only a few centimeters of air separated them 5 weeks ago.
Only a few centimeters.

They were lying on her bed.
Naked.
Breathing softly.
Both staring at the ceiling.
Not really looking at it

Melissa opened the door and walked into Dr. Francis' office.
She handed the cup of coffee to the doctor and said ""Here you go
He thanked her with a smile
""Damn, gently shaking her cunning caboose from side to side, the sexiest and most hypnotizing pendulum you'll ever see.

The Blu-ray un-paused.

It was a different scene.
It wasn't in the restaurant.
Not in Le Chateau Imperial.
Oh no.
It was in his office.
On the patient's bed. The type of bed with a large roll of Scottex at the top of it
She was on the bed.
The Scottex was all crunched up.
Her soft derriere was on the dark blue leather of the bed. The leather was cold. Smooth
He was standing in front of her.
Her legs were on his shoulders.
He was holding them.
Holding her thighs.
Her marble thighs.
His pants were down to his feet
His shirt was on the ground
She wasn't wearing much.
Her black skirt was somewhere on the cold floor.
Her white shirt was half open
It seems as if she was trying to hold up the wall behind her with her hands.
It seems as if she was having quite some fun.
Dr. Francis was too.
She was moaning. Looking at the handsome doctor dead in the eyes. Biting her lower lip.
His eyes were locked into hers. She lured them in
He didn't know what it was exactly

He was looking out the window for quite a while now. Not really looking at anything in particular. Just resting his eyes out there
He glanced down at his agenda, in small, classy, golden letters.
M.F.

He scribbled down some notes
He had some time before his next appointment, had a glass of fresh tap water, and sat back down at his desk. He moved mechanically, like a robot. As if someone had switched the autopilot lever inside his brain.

His thoughts wandered off again, trying to defeat one other, and take the highest spot on the doctor's mental podium.

Last night, his only thought was: ""Damn, I'm a fucking idiot.""
He wasn't sad. He was just happy to finally see her. Even though she would probably never come back into his life. Even though he wanted her to bits. Even though she had probably moved on
She seemed happy. Or maybe it was because of all the make-up
He was simply mesmerized by her presence.

They said Hi to each other, how are you? How have you been? How's your job? You got a promotion? Really? Wow that's amazing! Yeah I've been pretty good myself. Darren? Oh he's great... Are you gonna come pick him up on Friday? Okay, perfect. Just make sure he brushes his teeth. And does his homework. And doesn't eat cyanide. Or any type of poison. So yeah...

Mark paused the memory. He left it hanging there

A knock on the door.
""Come in"" said Mark

""Hey
""Your next patient is here
""Who is it? I'm sorry, palms down, as if trying justify his momentary amnesia with that simple gesture.
""It's Mrs Sheerer."" said Melissa
Dr. Francis rubbed his hands and exclaimed ""Mrs. Sheerer! Of course! Well send her in.""

He looked at his wristwatch.
10:30.
""Jesus Christ"" he thought. ""Why does time have to go by so goddamn slowly?""
""Why hellooo Mrs Sheerer!"" shouted the doctor
A fragile little lady had walked into the room; she looked as if the wind could take her away
""Excuse me
""What I said was, not irritated, but with the patience of an American suburb high school substitute.

""Oooh I'm okay my dear."" replied the golden girl

""My hearing device hasn't been working very well lately...""
""Could you give it a look please?"" shakily said Mrs Sheerer.
""Of coourse I can"" answered the doctor
""Let's see..."" he said, detecting any flaws in the small miraculous apparatus.

""So how are you my dear? How's Claire? Is she at home taking care of Darren?""

Dr. Francis kept his gaze on the device and said ""Claire isss uuhhh...""
A brief pause followed
""She's fine. Darren's probably in school by now.""

""You know"" said the doctor, where it always found a comfy place to rest.
""Life is pretty strange sometimes.You share your life with a person
You share amazing experiences, needing each other. You live together. You do everything together. Or almost everything.
And then

Dr. Francis paused for a moment, lingering beneath the surface.

""I mean sure, you don't really exist anymore. Not physically. Maybe mentally, as a distant memory. Waving at you, moving further and further away, while the volume of the sad melancholy music gradually rises.""

Mrs. Sheerer was fidgeting with her thumbs
She looked up at the doctor and said: ""Sorry did you say something dear?""
Dr. Francis snapped back to reality once again. He had let the Special Features play. You know
""NOTHING, cupping his hands around his mouth to make sure the old lady would hear him. Not sad, not irritated, quite happy actually. The Golden Girl's precious smile, her glazy eyes filled with cataracts, which had seen who knows how many things and bewitched who knows how many laddies; they bewitched the doctor as well. He couldn't be mad at the poor old lady for not having heard of word of his heart-breaking rant.

He handed the hearing device to her

So instead of focusing on the inevitable, he focused on the kids.

	For a moment he stared at the principal with his mouth half open. He glanced back at the kids one last time before saying “I can understand how you would think that.”
	The headmaster looked up at this, create blasphemous mischief and start countless shenanigans.”
	Mr. Rogan could not help but smile. The headmaster’s face became rigid. “Do you not see the common denominator of it all?” Mr. Rogan asked.
	The headmaster frowned at this.  “Things that cause kids to get into nothing but trouble?”

I looked at the man in front of me, above his eye. I then tilted the gun slightly as per the instructions I had been given. Once it was my turn I took one last deep breath. I had my finger rested on the trigger but it felt like there was a hundred pounds of resistance stopping me from pulling it. What was happening, why was it so hard to kill this man? I took one last deep breath, and slowly squeezed the trigger until I heard a loud bang from the gun followed by a soft thud when the body hit the floor. Blood began to pool around the body and it began to circle my feet.

     I remembered that my name was Bob Lamron. I am 23 years old
Two rather large males, a car appeared out of nowhere. From the car came a robotic voice; it addressed me by name and commanded me to enter the automobile.          As I got in the car, the voice spoke again. It asked me what my home address was. I had no clue; I could not even remember if I had children 10 minutes ago. How was I supposed to answer the voice with details of my forget life? The women who had presented me with the folder, a nurse, that I had woken up next to, ran out of the building and handed me the same folder that I had left behind in the room. I opened it up and aloud, “2534 Egareva Rd.” As soon as the words had left my mouth, presumably to the address.
As I saw the things I passed by I started to remember details, people, restaurants, fountains, everything! It was all flooding in as if there was a dam in my brain and it had just been ruptured without notice. We arrived at my house and I opened the front door. I walked into my room and sat down. I could not recall the events that had occurred before I woke up. It was like the dam of knowledge in my mind had been concealed. My mind had locked away any memories of the events and I could not do anything about it. The more I thought, the more my head hurt.
It felt like one of those moments when you are mid conversation with someone and another person, but when you try to come back into the original conversation, you can’t remember what you were talking about no matter how hard you try. I sat there on my couch and tried as hard as I could to recall what had happened.
I then positioned myself so that I could see out of the window. I saw a grey, the higher up your social class was. I was just an average grey.
As I was thinking through all of this, for that matter. Suddenly, I saw something concealed under the peeling paint. I knew I had to uncover it. As I tore the paint off a fit overcame me. Next thing I knew, I was tearing, ripping, and enjoying this more than anything I had enjoyed before. I was ripping everything in sight off the wall.
I stepped back and looked at my wall and there was writing everywhere. The memories started flooding back into my head of what had happened. I had uncovered something big. The government had been spiking everyone. Now they wouldn’t just bug a room, think, hear, and smell everything you have ever come in contact with. Knowing I had just remembered this I knew they would be after me. I shut the blinds and closed the door in my room.
I lightly lifted a blind cover and looked out the window. I saw a slim, wondering what I could do. The second I saw them barge in through the front door, I jumped out of my second story bedroom and landed on the pavement. My ankle buckled and I felt a sharp pain but I knew I had to get out of here and tell someone what is going on. I screamed names but no one would listen to me. I was living in a selfish world where people only cared about themselves. I gave up. I fell to the floor, my ankle throbbing, and looked at the door to my building, expecting the two men to walk through. I was doomed.
The two men eventually came out of my building and grabbed me. They didn’t say a word; all they would do is stare straight forward. Then they put me in the back of the car and drove off. It was the exact same route that led back to my house. I had only been out for an hour

Breaking eye contact first, the glides over to the secluded table. Motioning the waiter over she orders a Guinness for both her and the man.

1360366104.0,185u5x,Public Transportation (First ever),gzilla57,5,2,4,"I looked up from my dirty fingernails, various warnings

The assortment of people was as typically unusual as one would expect on the last train of the night. A couple sat across the aisle and one row in front of me. His hair was gray and clearly thinning at a rate that made him feel the need to grow it out some length and comb it back. He had a somewhat crooked grin as he looked at her and his eyes shown with the glint of a man who both knew he was getting away with something he shouldn’t be, a few days before they decide they’ve found their one true love, focusing wholly on the other. In fact their mannerisms appeared almost unnatural, as if they were hiding something that no one was looking for.  Perhaps they both had families and dull lives waiting for them at home and were enjoying this last train ride where the people are new and the conversations exciting.  The longer I am aware of the two the more I feel as though the man is looking at me out of the corner of his eye anytime his attention can be drawn away from the obviously infatuated woman at his side. 

On the far side of the car a boy perhaps sixteen years old was washing paint off of his face. An early Halloween costume no doubt. It was likely he had come from the concert as had a number of others on the train. The remaining seats on the train were filled with unremarkable individuals much like myself. A slightly overweight, a man in a suit who presumably had a late night at the office stares at his phone to maintain the guise of never ending importance necessary today to maintain a respectable foothold in society. Two women speak the loudest, in an excited Spanish that seemed untouched by the late hour. They were in their late twenties with similar short dark haircuts which made it difficult to discern whether they were friends, lovers, or sisters. A man sits with the bike which will be his only accompaniment on his ride home from the station. Families sit huddled across rows, the kids have all managed to fall asleep, the mother leans against her husband and closes her eyes but cannot manage to drift off

As I finished this glance around the train I noticed the woman that stood in front of me. I could not tell her age but determined she was old enough to understand the world but young enough to have her entire life before her. She was relatively tall, high waist, light blue jeans, which were modest for her slim figure. Her coat too was rather vague as if purchased for the sole purpose of blending into a crowd. She had her brown hair up in the back in a small bun and allowed the back of her hair to fall and cover her neck much as her bangs fell across her forehead. Her pale face grew solemnly dark around her eyes which sat sunken back into the depths of her face. Her cheekbones sat high on her face and gave her a dignified look that contrasted with her reserved appearance. She too had headphones in and every few seconds she would inaudibly mouth a line or two from whatever it may have been she was listening too. Her expression revealed nothing. She was empty, cold, unfazed by her surroundings. This isn’t to say she appeared unfriendly or apathetic, simply untouched by the never ending stimuli of her surroundings. Her focus lies beyond the events of the train car

The look on her face captured my imagination as it was more inviting to the speculation of her thoughts than that of anyone else in memory. I was left powerless to grasp at the few clues available to me in order to invent the monologue in her head. Perhaps it was as simple as the melody and words to whatever song was passing between her ears and occasionally across her lips. She could be reminding herself of what mundane tasks she was condemned to the next day. Or perhaps it could have been that she wanted nothing more than for the torrential stream of emotional realizations to cease for a moment and allow her the peace of an uncomfortable train ride. Undeniably her face revealed the surface of a past perhaps not of a troubled individual, into the faces of romantic ideals and the illusion of Gatsby’s dream. 

From her right nostril down to the top of her lip there was what appeared from my seat to be a trail of blood, did not even noticeably move her mouth save for the occasional unspoken word. 

A part of my typically repressed conscience began to question whether or not I had some obligation to ask her if she was alright. Not just in this particular moment as she appeared for the time being to fall within the general standards of being well, thanks”. I wanted to know the story behind that blood stain and to know the pain behind the eyes.  I want to know the emotion behind the ceaseless blank stare. 

I felt helpless in knowing that I knew now as much as I would ever know about this woman. My mind began to drift from her for a moment to explore ideas of people I will never meet, and emotions I have yet to realize. The train began to slow as it periodically did to allow for those lucky enough to be home to get off and she turned towards the doors. A bell rang over the speaker system as the door slid open and allowed her out into the West Oakland station, she walked past my window, and I never saw her again. The bell rang again and the doors slid closed. I look back from my window to where the woman was standing and an elderly man stood in her place. His expression revealed nothing.

Ray's fight or flight response was beginning to take control of his system as the dying star formerly known as Sol crept its way from sight. Why his designers put such a damned human response in him Ray would never know

His existence alone was proof that mankind had reached a level of intellect few had dreamed of - and even less had deemed possible before they destroyed themselves - As this whimsical thought brushed through Ray's organic based CPU his sympathetic nervous system triggered the adrenal gland to dump more epinephrine into his bloodstream - and Ray ran.

His rational thought processes diminished. His legs screamed for oxygen. His heart pounded. For the next twenty minutes Ray sprinted. Sprinted away from the source of his fear. Something incomprehensible. Something much more frightening than the armies he had faced before. Worse than even the largest artillery shelling he had ever been the target of. More fearsome than he himself was.

Though Ray was designed to be an unstoppable death monger for the 'radical' Cyo-Organics; Designed for nothing in the world to stop him or frighten him. Designed to crush all those who fought against the belief of integrating biology and machine.

""Hah. Religious wars.""

The concept eluded him as he thundered onwards.

""Damn humans.""

""ZAAAAAAAAP"" the sound of a thousand arcs of electricity suddenly came into being in his ears. The sound kicked his slowing Adrenal gland back into high gear as he was reminded why he was running. Them. The others. He had no name for them. Only fear of them and no time to contemplate what they wanted with him except perhaps his destruction. So he ran.

After he had completed his tasks of eliminating the opposing continents Ray had become...well...bored. He was an organic machine - designed for destruction. Armed with the highest tech available to the researchers. The EMP affixed to his back and powered by his core allowed him to easily subdue all attempts of defense in his conquest. The Gauss cannon embed in his arm's skeletal structure made short work of dispatching the then defenseless forces

Suddenly Ray became aware of a sense of weightlessness as all of his senses snapped to this change in reality. He immediately attempted to run faster but was only treading air. His gaze shifted upwards to it. Them. The ones who put such fear into his body. Immediately he was racked with nerve-jarring shakes as this feeling of fear reached limits he had never dreamed of. He was being drawn into the gaping maw of their craft. An oblong affair so completely pitch black it seemed to not exist. However

Lights. Bright lights. That was his first experience back in the waking world.

""What the he-"" suddenly he could not speak. His mouth worked. He was sure of his words. He knew how to put the two together. Nonetheless

""We have been watching you.""

A thundering voice. A voice of immense power and knowledge. A voice to strike fear.

""We have seen what you have done.""

Where was it coming from?

""Worry not.""

Ray felt immediate relaxation course through his body. Palpable. Calming. It lifted him up and set him in a sea of peace as the waves gently rocked his anxiety away. He began to have a sensation of a presence. It was the owner of the voice. For some reason he no longer felt the blistering fear and anxiety of before. Only tranquility. The presence instilled a knowledge to him. A knowing of their relationship. They had been watching this third planet of Sol for eons. They had set it in motion. They had nudged here. Prodded there. Created the circumstances that had led to his creation. They had a name. They had a face. They were his father. His mother. His brothers. They had created all of humanity as an end to a goal. Ray himself.

""We have a job for you.""

It gadded about the tree in a clumsy manner, then back stepped until the tree was in full view. At this point, the insolent owl took flight through the pines of the tree. It flew clumsily through the branches, knocking something off of it, and then continued through until it made its way out of the defensive tree’s grasp. The owl without so much as looking back continued its way through the night in a peculiar manner. The man continued watching the owl, but it was too dark
     
  When the morning finally came, maybe… He waited, waited; waited. He stared intensely at the ground surrounding the tree, searching for whatever it was, but to no avail. He grew worried. So many gruesome scenarios of poor defenseless birds ravaged his mind until he could take it no more. He back away from the window and returned to his room.

  A door opened with a man tall man standing hesitantly in the     doorway. The man was bearing brown boots, red,     plaid jacket. His face had been unshaved for days and his hair an excited flutter, but his eyes registered as those of a stoic. The man stood in there doorway staring at the taunting tree for a moment longer, then stepped forward. His movement was a clumsy traipse, but he continued onward. He was an awkward refrain, composed of lines; with anxious legs. His limbs were tangled like a streamer and he’d become an unclear, but he had a direction and stammered on for it. Once he finally reached the tree, “What an odd little pine cone.”

1358618102.0,16vu7w,The Bird Lady,commenterkeen,5,1,1,"Night was quickly approaching, to spread wings and go where the wind would take her.

She had been living in the parkade for over a month now. The doves had followed her all the way from Cliff's Edge, and the doves had been there every step of the way. She welcomed their company, because it was the only company she had.

A small dove landed on her shoulder and cooed softly in her ear. It ruffled its feathers, she was just an oversized dove, wingless and beakless but a friend nonetheless. They never judged her or ridiculed her because of the way she looked, or talked, or lived. They just accepted.

She gazed up wistfully at the Buniard Building and noticed there were a few lights on in some of the apartments. Still early, eating their T.V. dinners. The doves were her companions, her family. And the Buniard Building was her television set.

Through it she experienced the lives of its inhabitants. She learned to love some of them, and hoping things would come out right for them in the end. The day Mrs. Parkins suffered a heart attack she had been there, watching in horror, worried and angry at the injustices of life. Tonight Mr. Parkins was alone at home, pacing, clasping his hands tightly behind his back, moving like a caged animal - restless and lonely. Somehow she knew Mrs. Parkins had passed away. Perhaps it was the way he slouched, or the way he had stopped brooding

She turned her gaze back to the doves, and she was reminded of the story she had read in one of the papers, about a space shuttle that would soon be launched from Cape Canaveral and put the first man on the moon. How ridiculous it seemed, to spend so much money and effort to get to the moon, when there was so much suffering right here on Earth.

A chill wind started to blow. She heard its dismal howl, and hugged herself tightly. She got up and brought a trash can from the parkade, filled it with the newspapers she had found that day - the Herald and the Boston Globe and the New York Times - and lit a small fire.

Startled by the sudden heat, they returned to her outstretched arms, and pecked at the bread crumbs she held in her hands.

As her gaze drew back to the Buniard Building, like a mirage in the desert, and she wondered if perhaps - and just like the mirage - it was a matter of wishful thinking. Did she want something to happen? Perhaps looking up at the Buniard was not enough, perhaps she longed for something more, something real. Something that would happen to her for a change.

Soon the feeling passed

Young Vanessa Lewis was out by her bedroom window, in another apartment, Mr. Parkins was still pacing restlessly. Vanessa was a strange girl, but one of her favourite people to watch. She was forever arguing with her parents, like teenagers will, and sneaking off in the middle of the night. She spent long hours at her bedroom window, watching the doves, not knowing that she herself was being watched.

Time passed, and her gaze drifted, as it tended to do, back to the doves. They were acting strangely tonight, moving in short, abrupt movements, taking to the air and then returning, she thought. Maybe they

""Come

The pain in her back had returned with the cold, a small sign stated, although it was far from royal and hardly what she would call grand. She made her bed in the lush, wet grass, and lay beneath the stars, and waited for sleep to take her. Around her the doves cooed and pawed at her clothing, perhaps looking for a last scrap of bread before they went up to roost.

But she felt restless, as though a candle had been lit in her belly. Her eyes sparkled with a life she thought she had lost long ago.

Two thirty-two ounce Jeremiah Reds and we still looked sharper than a butcher's knife. It takes a real man to order a bottle of red, BJ's brew house.
     

As it turns out, beers were running low, and I hadn't been offered sex all night. This combination of unfortunate mishaps started giving me an odd feeling. I needed to shake off this funk, but I was out of smokes. My good friend Mauri sensed my discomfort, that or my childish fidgeting from craving a smoke. Whatever the case, it worked. He spotted a friendly, slanted eyed
     

Mauri put away our third friend for a later puff. Normally he'll do it with such elegance, but still handsome, earlobe. What normally wouldn't affect a frail or even a wet cigarette, this time destroyed our last piece of lung candy. Things were happening. Bad vibes were definitely out tonight. I decided at this point, it was up to me to keep bad shit from happening. I didn't mention any of these strange occurrences to Mauri or Mikey, I had to keep my composure. Lead by example and example the lead. It works.
     

It was getting late and it began to feel as if we had overstayed our welcome
     

We left to resume our night. The feelings that manifested at the bar had followed to the parking lot. Maybe it just wasn't my night, but I didn't even put up a fight for the front seat.
     
""Shotgun!"" Mauri called enthusiastically.
     
I let out a quiet sigh, the Beastie Boys. With our last set of Reds in our hand and our heads boppin' he began to lay out the plan for the night.
     

""We're gonna head over to jack in the box to try that new jalapeno burger..."" He said with such anticipation
     

Just when I was starting to feel right for the night, but all I could make out was Mikey going on with the plans and Mauri trying to rap to the B-boys. I closed my eyes. This was it. Whatever bad energy that was following us, it was here and it was about to blow. It was up to me to try to decipher where it was going to come from. I presses my eyelids shut. And I knew.
     

""Holy shit!"" Mauri yelled in the front.
     

I quickly fastened my seat belt and braced myself for impact. Some dumb bitch had made the roughest turn any of us had seen. Although alert Mikey reacted as fast as he cums, and I had let them down. I should've said something. But men don't think in 'should'ves', we think for the moment and at that moment Mauri and I knew we had to dispose of any incriminating substance. We played the part.
     

""What the fuck?!"" Mauri exclaimed as he stepped out.
     
""Ahh mah shoulder!"" I played along.
     
""Are you guys ok?"" A worried voice shouted from the other car. We had them.
     

I quickly grabbed my bottle of Red and made my way to some stairway away from the crash. Mauri followed, and I was glad the bad vibes ended with something so trivial as a car crash. We waited, smoked, took tourist pictures of the sight and decided it was as good moment as any to call it a night.",,False,,False,t3_16gr2s

 When she fell she shattered a small flower pot

**Do it! She hates you, a voice that was not of my own logic. It speaks to me in evil tongues and for a while I listened. I listened very well.

I was going to do it.

**KILL

I fried one shot. It screamed through the home before silence came down upon the household. With the one shot

In the house would lay one body. But with two souls.

I killed it. I promised myself I would kill it, I'm the master. And now it is dead, silenced by me; silenced me.

I looked outside the dome. The red clouds blanketed the sky covering the sun and the desert soil. I looked back inside

The phone which hung on the wall started to ring. I had never heard it ring before so I stared subconsciously before I remembered that I had to answer it. I walked over to the handset. The light blinked as the receiver stopped ringing.
The door flung open and two cops burst through the door.

‘Mr Collins?’ I looked at the guard.

‘Who’s asking?’ I replied.

The guards walked over

I looked the opposite way I was travelling as I skidded along. It was an odd sensation knowing that my life would end. The cold argon lights illuminated the room giving off a cold chill. I wondered who had invented them. The ability to turn heat into light whilst cooling the surrounding area had saved millions of lives

We rounded several corners before we stopped. The guards dropped me to the ground and walked back the way I had come

I stood up and brushed myself off. I had not collected a speck of dust because of the cleanliness of the corridor

‘Do you know why you’re here?’ He asked me.

‘Not really.’ I responded knowing full well why I was there.

‘Mr John Collins, you were a model student, scoring an average score of a B+. We have no behavioural issues on record but a warning was issued in regards to a threat made to a colleague. You are an automotive service technician and you have no known offspring.’ He looked up and glared at me, waiting for a response.

‘Correct’ I responded.

‘On behalf of CiteRT

I looked outside the window behind him. I looked off into the distance

‘I accept.’ I don’t know why I did; it was just prolonging my agony. He stood up and handed me a backpack. 

‘I’m sorry.’ He said. ‘Good luck.’ I saw the glint of a tear forming in my eye. He ushered me towards an elevator where I went further down than I ever had before. The elevator pinged as the doors opened and thousands of years of global warming hit my face in one blast.

I fell to one knee and opened my backpack to find a bottle of water and a gun. I put the gun to my head

Her final call was half my name and half violence. Our pursuers had reached us, pleading with them, they attacked me as well. My ribs, neck and head received a flurry of strikes and a sharp shock to the back told me I had been stabbed. A new taste graced my tongue and spilled to the floor. I sputtered and my breathing seized.

The candle's glow sharpened with a new scream. The last offering from the poor girl. It echoed off cold walls, and invaded my blood. Our assailants had left their dagger in me. I painfully stretched and writhed, grasping the blade and freeing it from between my ribs. It was ancient, inscribed with a language unknown to myself on a shining, yet darker than gunmetal blade.

I attempted to stand. Control was coming back, seemingly as terrified as I was in the dark. I descended more steps, expecting the flames of hell to greet my soles. 

She was forcibly laid on an altar. They did not attempt to bind her. They simply held her

I couldn't pay her any mind. They watched as I staggered into the light. They were not surprised. I was expected. The only words offered were

I worked quickly, as they lay writhing on the floor, choking on their final breaths, I felt unsatisfied. And then, panicked. 
What had I done? I hadn't known these people, I felt the need to cover my tracks. The crackling fire, blazing high to the ceiling, offered me a solution. I slowly, laboriously dragged each corpse, and some, soon-to-be corpses, singeing myself as I pushed them into the heat.

In my excitement I forgot about my wound. Something, despite the massive rush of blood seeping out. With my shirt I attempted to stop it and turned to face the stairs. I began the long journey skyward, accompanied by my footsteps and new memories only.

After what seemed to be hours, I weakly joked to myself. The grate swung open, crashing hard. The sound of the city greeted my ears again, and artificial light, fluorescent, neon, lit the alleyway like daylight. I struggled to lift and close the grate with another slam. I began walking quickly

""You look dead, arms protecting his drink. I could hardly speak, and became more worried, looking for more viewers. I limped to my apartment as fast as my legs would allow.

I felt like I had conquered easier mountains. The last bit of stairs leading to my apartment tested me more than anything else that day. Several times I collapsed weakly, how long our ordeal lasted. I shuffled the last few steps to the door, unlocked it, entered and slammed it shut quickly, locking every available lock. I crawled through the kitchen, to the bathroom, leaning on the sink. I turned it on, before searching for gauze. Too tired to care

I found no relief from the terror of yesterday in my unconscious. Events played and replayed, the fear as the girl was dragged away forever. I felt once again the warm fire, the cold stares of my victims. They seemed to stare at me even in death, and beyond the flames' consumption. I saw myself again, from a different point of view, as I stumbled wildly from the alley to my apartment, more ragged and animalistic than I remembered. Like a madman, drinking, seated neatly on an old folding chair.

There is a pulse to everything in life; a steady rhythm that resonates through this world, or the pounding heartbeats of two lovers beating in unison at the start of a sleepless night, every moment in life has a distinct cadence that seems at times to be the only thing pushing time forward. It can inspire euphoria or strike fear in our hearts, but with no regard for anyone else it presents itself and begs for our attention.

It was the chaotic ringing of my alarm clock and subsequent pounding in my head that woke me up this morning. Like a bat out of hell the shrieking of that damned machine cut through the peaceful realm of my dream, silence does not settle on us but rather the subtle vibrations of a hundred other students quietly preparing for the morning class we never should have signed up for. The scraping of my toothbrush, the hum of the AC kicking in, the roar of water rushing out of the shower head to meet me head on; one noise leading to another to compose the jumbled melody that echoes through the dorm hall and out into the crowded streets where it joins a symphony of cars, bikes, morning joggers, and disgruntled youth on their way to class. 

Soon I was a part of that symphony, that she would still feel the same as she did when we last spoke. Fear, that I wasn’t good enough. Anger, that I had once done wrong by her, putting me in such a delicate and unsure situation. Hope, that maybe we were still recoverable. It had been almost two years since I messed up, and here she was driving 6 hours just to see me. 

The fluctuations of my emotions settled into a steady drone of uncertainty as I crossed the street. The blaring of a car horn interrupts my favorite part of the song and I flick off the driver who was apparently so inconvenienced by a 5mph decrease in speed that he needed to let the whole block know. Asshole. 

The sun is warm on my back but a cool breeze pushing against me sends shivers down my spine. The thud of each footstep sends unwanted vibrations through my sore legs, “my math professor probably won’t accept “the wind told me not to come” as an excuse for missing the quiz today.” I hate this class. While it may be easy, it’s also all the way across campus and at 9 in the morning. 

I miss summer with no responsibilities: when I could stay up late and look for trouble without a care in the world. We got in a big fight this summer; me and the girl did. It had been the first time we had spoken in over a year, she texted me. Somehow the conversation never ended. We talked everyday, and while it was strange at first, we slowly evolved, or perhaps regressed, to a level of comfort neither of us had known for years. It was great. Is great.

Nine impressive booms brought me back to the present as the clock towers time reverberated across campus. I picked up my own pace knowing I hade 10 minutes to get there

All I see is the blue sky; it really is a nice day. Something hurts

I remember six years ago when I first met her, and girls just loved it. But she was in there. She liked him, but that was to be expected. He was confident and athletic, me: not really either. 

I hear a siren coming

It’s Valentines Day and I’m anxiously sitting in second period. I had bought her flowers the day before. Two roses to be delivered sometime this period. I can hardly contain myself. My best friend runs into my class laughing hysterically. He says I spelt her name wrong on the card, sends blood rushing to my cheeks. 

Somebody is pressing on my chest, which strangely is suddenly so much quieter. 

It’s been a month since I butchered my Valentines Day plans

The paramedic’s head is eclipsing the sun behind him

It’s 3 years ago. I’m a sophomore and a little more mature than the awkward preteen who barely survived middle school. Through some bad experiences with girls I’d become a little jaded. The disappearance of the ignorant nice guy persona ironically gave way to a more confident attitude that some described as me being, who sat right next to me, was dating some other kid in the class, but that didn’t stop me from trying to occupy all her attention right in front of him. She was temporarily out of reach, but I was making an impression. As the teacher’s instructions began to fill the room with the unfamiliar tone of a foreign language, I glance over at her, she at me

The paramedic stops performing CPR. His tireless effort seems to have finally found success. But the sad expression on his face and the stillness of my chest forces me to realize the alternative. 

It’s October 10, I’ve been drinking and time loses meaning on nights like these. I pull my shirt over my head, my pants long gone. The girl pulls me on top of her, and we kiss. Four long years brought me to her, and there is nothing in my world except the pounding of her heart against my chest, the rhythm of our tongues, and the room spinning around me. But before we could proceed a thundering knock interrupts our perfect moment. Somebody calls up that my dad is drunk and at the front door.
 
I realize that this might not end the way I’d hoped. Everything seems distant

It’s December 28, and I hear the gentle hum of Christmas music from the other side of the door. She answers the door in a bra and Santa skirt, her perfect body greeting me in a fashion I could never have fantasized. She leads me up the stairs as our footsteps echo through the empty house, and I am truly happy. 

The ever-present pulse that prods life along doesn’t miss a beat, but I can’t be mad that the rhythm is leaving me. It has a job to do and I wouldn’t deny the rest of the earth its soothing presence. 

It’s April 12, and she doesn’t know what to do. She can’t trust me she says. She doesn’t understand why or how I could do this to her. I don’t either. She drives away, and I’m left standing in the punishing cold, unwilling to admit this is real. I close my wet eyes, and the roar of the wind envelopes my senses. 

I feel like I’m sinking into myself. A darkness on all sides begins to encroach on my vision

The nation’s news-media grew increasingly cynical, ate up these stories and wallowed in its unhappiness.  As a result those with mental disorders such as antisocial personality disorder, psychopathy and narcissistic personality disorder, began to believe that they were in fact part of the majority, as people had forgotten long ago that TV was not a true representation of reality.  Such individuals became so convinced of their normalcy that they never sought out the mental counseling they so desperately needed, and as their self-assurance grew so did their boldness.  

A few started openly killing innocents, scared and delusional, gave up one civil liberty after another until the freedom the nation once held proudly over the heads of the rest of the world was nothing more than a distant memory.  Its citizens grew divided between the five stages of grief; denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance as though each stage were in fact an ideology to live by.  

Only a small percentage of the population had made it to the final stage and the deniers were so desperate to believe that everything would be OK that they turned their back completely on science and reason, and so the nation was locked in a terrible stand still, completely unable to deal with the current problems and imminent dangers of the future.  

Only one solution seemed to remain; revolution.  A total revision of government and civilization.  But revolution was never to happen, complete apathy or a mix of the two.  Each time an uprising started it was never able to gain enough momentum to stop the government from quelling it, through military and police action, and more powerfully through clever manipulation of the press and propaganda.  People came to fear conflict more than anything, especially amongst themselves and so they created societal restrictions on which words they could say and which situations they could show in movies and on TV. In this stifling environment people became unable to think for themselves, and creativity and originality were snuffed out.  Suicides, murders and sickness grew.  

Some began openly hoping for the end of their world.  Nature began lashing out in its death throes as the misery of money continued to strangle it.  Floods, and terrible storms wreaked havoc across the planet.  Wars over resources broke out around the globe, and finally the government took total control of the nation through military and police supervision.  Each and every citizen was now a ward of the state, but even with strict laws in place limiting the production of more children the population had already grown too large to sustain.  Soon governments around the world began to consider something once thought to be unthinkable-nuclear war.  

All it took was one missile, an event which scientists had been warning about for decades, consumed the planet.  The access to food and water, already scarce, became virtually non-existent and the starving population bottlenecked.  The humans, plants and animals that managed to survive were plagued with genetic mutations and disease.  Extinctions on a massive scale ravaged the land and sea.  Eventually only a small niche of organic life remained, breeding and evolving over many thousands of years to create a new era.  Although some mutated form of the human genome survived

All information that humans had gathered and analyzed over the centuries was lost forever, any existence of life on the planet Earth and possibly in the entire known universe was completely eliminated.  Doomed to revert to the stardust which had originally allowed for its creation.

Sparing one last glance at his younger brother, not a child but far from a man still. He closed the door quietly behind him and continued down the hallway into the common room.


He glanced out into the back yard, not peaceful, but still like death. He picked up a small satellite phone he had left on the floor amongst other things, blankets and small canisters, batteries and small cans of food. There were two pistols on top of a large metal case. It was filled with ammunition of a smaller caliber. Large weapons were hard to come by so he made due with what he could find. He dialed a number into the phones keypad and waited silently, wondering how long it would take for the worlds communications to fall. They worked on batteries, but how long the satellites would last was anyone’s guess. He considered the fact that someone must be maintaining them, he knew not.

Cold.  Freezing.
	

Jacob was cold.  White snow fell around him and on him.  The snow on the ground next to him was stained a scarlet red.  Jacob’s head turned
	

The sun was setting
	
His comrades?
	
Where were they?  A thousand thoughts flashed through his mind as he struggled to remember what had happened.  He looked down at his stomach, so he had a little more time to live.  
	
Suddenly
	
Pain flashed through his stomach as he wiped his mouth on his shirt sleeve.  The nasty taste in his mouth receded a bit.  Jacob tried to move away from the vomit
	
Memories of a dark shadow flitted through his mind.  Then it all came back to him in a flood of memories.

**TWO HOURS EARLIER**
	
“Hey
	
Jacob turned

“That’s Sergeant First Class Parham to you
	
“Here
	
Jacob declined and sat down on a small stool.  About ten similar stools formed a ring around a small crackling fire.  Jacob counted two seats open and two faces missing.  Those two had just left on patrol.  The remaining men were to wait in base camp until they got back.  Then two more would take their places.  The men were due back in thirty minutes.  The two that had just returned from patrol were chatting with the others about what they had found in the woods of Germany.
	
“I swear it was a footprint!  A huge one
	
He turned around to face the sergeant and Jacob realized that it was Kirby.  Kirby was a green private
	
“Listen here Private
	
“B-but
	
Walton chuckled and shook his head a little.  “Don’t worry about it, but, to his dismay, found it empty and returned it to his pocket.  He felt in his other pocket, but the only thing in it was a grenade.  Just in case.
	
Kirby’s patrol buddy
	
“So we’re hiking through the woods, a button over dere, and maybe a boot half buried in the ground, see?”  He turned to find Jacob staring at him, eyebrows raised.
	
“Oh, I made sure.  Dey couldn’t have been living dere recently, dere were no signs of recent activity!”  He turned back to continue his story.
	
“So me an’ Kirby here were scoutin’ around, dis skeleton juss’ layin’ on the ground.  Flesh all gone, been eaten off by rats and insects, I s’pose.”
	
At this point

“He was wearin’ a tattered German uniform and his skull was a bit cracked on the top
	
To prove his point, and there was also the usual dirt smears and smudges.  Wooden grinned and slipped the helmet into his bag while Jacob pretended not to notice.
	
“Hey!” Walton yelled
	
“Nothing, just ask.”
	
“Thanks buddy
	
The time went by as the men told jokes, guns propped against their shoulders and grins on their faces.  The others rose with shouts of greetings, except for Walton, who was groaning sarcastically about having to go on the next patrol.  Everyone felt great.  And then, something happened.
	
A dark shadow flashed out from the woods and both men were knocked to the ground.  One was tugged screaming out of sight within seconds.  The other men scrambled for their weapons and the poor fellows screaming suddenly stopped.  Everyone was still and quiet for a second as though a hushed silence had just descended upon them.  
Jacob broke this spell by running towards the woods
	
Somewhere in the woods
	
It was a standard M-1 rifle.  That was not the problem.  The problem was the still twitching hand holding on to the rifle.  There was a class ring on one of the fingers.  Class of 1939.  Walton’s.  Jacob gulped and turned around as another scream sounded.  Jacob froze.  He looked all around
	
Jacob’s palms were sweaty on the gun.  He licked his chapped lips and took off in the direction of the last scream.  He had to find his soldiers.  He just had to!  He followed the trail of snapped branches, all dotted with drops of bright red blood.
	
A bird twittered in a branch above Jacob’s head and he flinched.  A small animal darted through the woods past Jacob and he involuntarily squeezed off a few shots at the poor animal.  The squirrel fell dead in its tracks.  Jacob passed right by it
	
A branch broke and Jacob turned in the direction of the sound.  His gun pointed at a silhouette in the darkening forest.  “W-Walton?” he stuttered
	
As the thing moved closer
	
It.  A hairy beast.  Seven or eight feet tall.  Jacob gasped nervously
	
A torn piece of camouflage material hung from the creature’s mouth.  Jacob’s mind snapped and he screamed like a homicidal maniac, he was.  Jacob’s finger clenched around the trigger and the gun barrel began spewing bullets right and left.  A few shots hit home, but they didn’t seem to faze the creature.
	
Click.  Click click click.  No more ammo.  A large hairy fist slammed into Jacob’s stomach and he collided with a tree.  He coughed up blood and the bittersweet taste returned him to his senses.  Painfully
	
The thing was in hot pursuit.  Somehow, but he kept on running.  Time seemed to slow down.  Ten feet to the river.  Five feet.  Two feet.  Inches.  “Jump.” Jacob’s mind told him.
	
Jacob jumped.  He launched himself over the river.  Little minnows and bigger fish alike darted around in the water beneath him.  It was very deep.  Jacob’s feet hit the ground on the edge of the other side of the river and he leaned forward into a roll.  Dizzy
	
“Aha ha ha ha!” Jacob laughed.  The beast glared malevolently at him and Jacob suddenly wished he had remained silent.
	
The beast put its foot in the water and did the same with the other.  It took a step and the water went up to its hairy waist.  Another step and the waters were up to its shoulders.  The thing wasn’t even halfway across when its head disappeared beneath the calmly moving water.  
	
Jacob knelt and began to pray as he had never prayed before.  “Let it have drowned.  Please, please God!”  Jacob’s voice had become shrill.
	
A head poked through the surface of the water
	
But Fate had different plans and the monster lunged at him


**PRESENT TIME**

	
Jacob coughed up blood again.  The cough wracked his entire frame.  He heard heavy steps growing closer.  Jacob fumbled at the chain around his neck.  His numb fingers were unable to undo the clasp.  Growing desperate, his wife, and his son.  

Tears glistened around his eyes as he fought the urge to cry.  A sob escaped and he heard the footsteps grow closer.  He kissed the locket and slipped it into his pocket.  Death was knocking at his door.
	
But Jacob was now ready to welcome Death.  He found himself grinning for some reason.  There was a little lump in his pocket.  His fingers closed around the small metal cylinder.  From out of his pocket
	
“Hey you big creep!” he shouted
	
Jacob heard the deep growl behind him and cocked his head towards it.  He was struggling to sit up when a powerful grasp closed around his waist.  The already stabbing pain in his mangled chest intensified.  Jacob shut his eyes and resisted the urge to scream.  He pulled the pin on the grenade and extended it close to the monster’s terrible face.  Jacob’s eyes opened.
	
“Go to hell
	
The grenade exploded.

The dead soldier’s face was unrecognizable by the time they stopped Private Anderson. The stock of his rifle was implanted in the side of the enemy soldier’s skull

As recalled by Lieutenant Jeffries, but nothing so primal, so pure. It was like Anderson spewed a patchwork quilt of sorrow, horror, and darkness over the men, and when it settled it found every nerve in their bodies and plucked it like a guitar string. Watching him lose it, they all felt cold. Because they knew it could be them, “the itch!” Just like Anderson.

     I usually never dreamt but tonight was different. I found the dream to take me to an airplane cockpit. There was a pilot and a man in a jumpsuit standing next to it. ""Ready to jump?"" the man shouted as he opened the plane door. A gust of wind flooded into the cockpit. ""Remember, JUMP!"" the man shouted as he leaped out of the plane. I hesitated looking at the long drop below me. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes; I jumped. 
       The wind pounded against my face as if someone had placed a jet engine in front of me. It stung my skin as it pounded against my mouth
     The man was no where to be seen. I panicked and decided to pull my parachute. I pulled the blue chord; nothing. I pulled the red chord; nothing. My parachute hadn't deployed. I began to freak out; my parachuted hadn't deployed and I was falling at around a hundred miles per hour towards solid ground. I was going to die. I frantically began looking over my jumpsuit for something that could possibly break my fall and save my life. A backup parachute perhaps. I remembered in lots of movies that the one who's parachute didn't deploy always had a backup parachute. I scoured my jumpsuit for something of such nature. I spotted a small handle with the inscription ""emergency"" on it. This had to be it. I frantically pulled it and a small parachute burst put of my suit. I was saved for the moment

A young boy stood still in a forest. Pools of sunlight slowly grew and retracted with a light breeze. Timelessness and faint understanding of place and existence crept in. Echoes of birds birthed a sting of emotion, I was truly free. 

A young man sat in a field. No roads were near, purple wildflowers, and patches of goldenrod gently swayed. Warm sunlight eased his strain. Vividly green trees enclosed this paradise. Scents melded together, creating a delicate aroma. Everything was so alive, so detached. His world struggled to understand this concept. The young man embraced it as something more. Wisps of high cirrus clouds raced across the depth of the blue sky. Here, he felt himself become a child again. He shed his worldly concerns, closed his eyes

A middle aged man sat on a small strip of sand, leaving no ripples behind it. Stars and planets rose into view, reflected so perfectly that one might genuinely not be able to determine the difference between horizons. Auroras painted themselves across the sky. Fierce reds clashed with persistent greens, sending bickering splashes off in all directions. I knew all I would ever need to know. 


He snapped back into his world, purpose was sent helter skelter by pressure to succeed at trivial and pointless things. How burdened they are, he thought to himself. How strange I must seem to them now. How silly they will feel once they are me. His grip loosened, and his vision blurred.

You know the word hurts her.  In your mind’s eye, and drills its way into her veins.  You must have known how she would answer.

“That’s good.”

There’s a long silence.  Perhaps her words had the same effect on you

The silence stretches further.  You can tell that she’s waiting for you to apologise and make everything right again

The silence is harsh now, pressing down on the picture of the red phone with a firm click.  That was your last chance to speak together before they shut off all communication and close the doors, but at this moment you don’t want to care.

Why couldn’t you have just gone with her, that you wanted to die someplace where you could still see a new dawn or a new face.  She didn’t understand you; if the end is the same, then surely an extended night is better than a brief dawn?  She never could understand how you felt, how you nobly embraced your death, content with the life you had led, whilst she hid in the ground like a coward.

She still remembers when the two of you first met.  It was her first summer in England since she fled from her homeland.  She lived for a while as an outsider, and had just begun to settle in when she spilled a cup of coffee on you at the station.  You exchanged bouts of apologies and self-blame until they were gradually replaced with dull platitudes and became conversation, and you asked her to join you for a drink.

You took her to what you said was the best coffee shop in all of London; it was a standard coffee chain – Starbucks, the light would rush and weave its way along the cobbled alley, and its wealds would engulf the shop in warmth and make it shine.  She only understood about half of the words you used, but it seemed to make her feel safe for a time.  You didn’t seem like most English men, not chasing after the latest car or piece of Apple merchandise, but thoughtful, considerate.  You were intelligent, Socrates

The two of you had discussed the idea of someone pressing that infamous red button back then as a thought exercise, you’d both rather die someplace where you could see a new dawn.  She was still affected by her experience of war in her homeland, and was determined that nothing would make her flee her new home, that she’d rather die than live in a cage – even one of her own choosing.  That was four years ago; you were both young and foolish, filled with noble, quixotic ideas of romance and freedom.

“Everything ends eventually, you know.”

It was reassuring for her to know that the world in which she had suffered so much would come to an end someday

It was on the day that the war that had engulfed her home finally came to an end – one or two years ago, for it had brought her a new home, a new chance at life, and you; to you, the world’s progress – being entirely unrelated to your own – was insignificant, and the world’s ignorance of your talent served only to confirm your perception of yourself as a chained and muzzled muse, yearning to break free and soar above the philistine mob.

Over time, and you seemed to feel for her, although you weren’t quite sure.  Maybe you would have loved her someday, but the current events distracted you; with tensions mounting over Syria and Iran, suddenly the idea of someone pushing the red button didn’t seem quite so ridiculous anymore.  It scared you.

The government announced the bunker system a month ago, and you thought you knew what.  She wanted a piece of metal for herself, a band of metal and a rock to wrap around her finger and to chain your inner artist once and for all.  How selfish.  You didn’t think you were ready for that commitment.  It scared you.
So you focused yourself upon your art, how you were going to cheat that familiar stranger, Death.  You needed no philosopher’s stone or alchemist’s piss, through your art you would become immortal, infinite.  But the nagging feeling at the back of your mind warned that you would fail, that you would die unnoticed and unable to repent.  It scared you.

There was warning before the missiles were going to hit, to the bunkers, and she needed you to join her.  Your throat turned to ice.  Hadn’t you already told her that you didn’t want to live your life with her in a metal house?  Hadn’t she said that she didn’t want to die in a cage, wasn’t the dawn important to her?

She said that it was about immortality, that was the point, but what was the point in love if it isn’t eternal?

You wouldn’t listen to her entreaties, and it must be her fault.  You didn’t know, but by this point you had built your own metal prison.  You have trapped yourself inside a cocoon of solipsistic iron and you can’t find a way out.  You are lost in a maze and the hollow walls are razors that tear and split your skin, and all that lies at the centre is a hangman’s noose.

But it’s not your fault is it?  It’s hers!  You call her witch and a whore, but her words have no bite, she thinks she’s lying.

So it’s over.  You tell her never to call you again
“Wait

So you wait; the shop is deserted now, sucking all warmth from the shop until it seems entirely forsaken, empty.

There’s a small vibration in your pocket; you pull out your phone and answer the call.  She asks you how you are.

The handles on the backs of the seats kind of suck up the comfort. You first see her sitting three rows ahead, slender, frail and quite. You would like very much to speak with her. Nothing creepy, but it's been a while since you've talked with someone who wasn't a crack head or strung out or family. Touching, that's far out of the question.

A rest stop comes soon. Very scenic, and slight hills. Just the kind of nowhere place you've become accustomed to; you and your little red bag, with everything you need, freshly restocked with ketchup and sugar packets, honey and whatnot. Bits of crayon, business cards, scraps of paper, which you have in your hand, nothing of great importance

And that girl is out and about, boxy and blue, pulled forward to the limit, while a pale green branch twists a lonely way up, as the girl stands underneath, unencumbered, turned slightly away, or the Louvre.  And as like

Seeing surprisingly few cars and hearing even less, with hunching lines wrapped around, keeping warmth close to home. Fellow passengers begin to exit, some with big white bags, leopard print grease spots, many with large plastic cups. Each handful equal to a week of change that you yourself give for food. You find first-world self-imposed hunger to be quite a joy, at times. Henry David said it best you think

""Some View."" You speak in horrid tones. Her words make no impression

It takes quite a lot of radiation to bring you along. Mass and gravity. Once it's begun; inevitable. You drop your pack in a square room, broken mirror and the beginning of christmas lights, her old classmates and exchange program vets, introduction and pot. And a couch, maybe more. You have no problem taking what's given, and road kill is godsend.

Your mind reels. Potent stuff, paramilitary air support looking back through sights; it's possible. This view interests those new friends of yours, wavelengths mesh, and you begin to believe in yourself, how you've found it: belongings.

You sit in a room with them all, more or less, with powers and responsibilities of a low but noticeable magnitude. Tenuous roots embed, expand. A schedule of sorts, time meaning something besides departure. Love?

And you are surrounded, no lid, wide open, a part of the scene, and you are engulfed. Flesh-body-soul enter those around you, the choice bits going to the blonde who brought you in, and nothing remains but contentedness.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/12g3s5/the_traveler/

*Are you really happy?*
 

The advertisement’s subtitles scrolled across the screen in time with the voice, as if it were some great fatherly deity looking down upon its children and asking them if they were all right, did they want anything from the store? Was school going okay for them?

It was a question Demetri could imagine coming from a doctor too

Are you hot?

Are you cold?
Where does it hurt?

Can you feel this?

*Are you really happy?*

The symptom was unhappiness,’ no, the advertisement called out to everyone who simply wasn’t happy all of the time.

The advertisement called out to the entirety of the human race.

Unhappiness was a symptom of the sickness that was the human condition, efficient, and ultimately accessible by all. It cornered a market that had existed for eternity, a market that in itself contained all others; vacations, travelling, dining out, film, all of them fell in comparison. If the generally accepted goal of life was to be happy, eBracelet™

What was the point of anything at all?

The eccessories™ were just the tools for the medication, evoke, engineer, happiness.

 

*Are you really happy?*

 

It came in varying degrees,’ of Elysia that you bought. Demetri liked all of the mixes (as did everyone of course, how could they not, it was happiness), but his recent favourites included Warm Summer Picnic™, First Kiss™, and Hugs on a Cold Day™ . He had saved up enough recently to purchase his own eNecklace™ but had not yet accumulated enough money to try the recently released Happily Married™. But that didn’t matter, fulfilled even, so as long as he was wearing his eNecklace™ women knew they would be happy with him.

‘The most attractive quality to have is a truly happy smile, all people wanted was to be happy, what else mattered? And a smile meant you were happy, right?

In the last few years there had been very few technological advances outside of anything directly related to Elysia, try new ‘Won the Lottery™’ today!” scrolled across the electronic billboard above him, Demetri smiled happily, that mix had been a good one.

 

*Are you really happy?*

If Demetri wasn’t so happy he’d be frustrated hearing that question so often. Of course he was happy, towards a pretty woman he’d made quite inviting  eye contact with.

It occurred to him that he couldn’t actually remember his first kiss.

Why was he thinking that? What did it matter? He shrugged off the thought, on the floor of his consciousness. Come on, it couldn’t be so hard to remember something like that. A feeling he was so used to these days…

Lost in his mind

He heard a series of cracks as his jaw crashed against the footpath and left a lovely half-skid of blood as he lifted himself up.

 

*Are you really happy?*

 

He pulled himself up and tried to wipe the red spittle from his face

It hurt.

Their first fight had been in a park, nestled against him, she’d looked up and kissed him.. It had been a year or so before she’d gotten cancer. Cancer was hardly an issue now though, the suffering were given free Elysia, what more could they want, they died happily?

Demetri’s stomach tightened

He didn’t want to think about her

           

No.  
No.  
No.  

 

*Are you really happy?*

 

In his head, with Demetri’s lack of answer. What did it matter that she had died? He was happy, everyone in the whole world was so fucking happy all the time, what did it matter.

No.  

No.  

 

He just wanted to be happy
A dark wave of nostalgia, pain, frustration, boredom, cold, weakness.

And love.

A wave from an ocean so deep, feelings like his mother crying when she only had to make one cup of tea in the morning.
Feelings like a soft kiss in the rain.

Like the rain they washed over him, created him and destroyed him, defined and erased him.

Feelings that were real.

 

*Are you really happy?*

 

And like rain they fell to the ground in front of him

And then they were gone.

His consciousness writhed in frustration for but a moment
But it was gone.

Demetri blinked.
He stared at the smooth concrete in front of him.
The scrape of blood was slowly coalescing with a few soft

He pushed open the door, which contained no furniture but a plain kitchen table and a rocking chair. On one of the dirty walls were a couple of shelves, containing about a dozen bottles and jars. An old man sat in the rocking chair, reading a newspaper. Rick, without a word, handed him the card he had been given.

“Sit down

“I am glad to make your acquaintance… but I must ask now, um, extraordinary effects?”

“Mr. Thorn, anti-depressants, and anti-histamines. I think nothing I sell has the effects which could precisely be described as ordinary.”

“Well

“Do you mean it is a poison?” cried Rick

“Call it a glove-cleaner if you like

“I want nothing of the sort

“Oh, which is enough, I ask twenty thousand dollars. Never less.”

“I hope all your mixtures are not as expensive

“I am glad to hear that

“I look at it like this, if necessary.”

“She will actually be jealous?” cried Rick in a rapture. “Of me?”

“Yes

“Wonderful!”

“She will want to know all you do. All that has happened to you during the day. Every word of it. She will want to know what you are thinking about

“This is love!”

“Yes, to neglect your food. If you are an hour late, she will be terrified, and think that you have been killed.”

“I can hardly imagine a Diana like that!” cried Rick

“You will not have to use your imagination. And, if by any chance you should, later on, slip a little, you need not worry. She will forgive you, in the end. She will be terribly hurt, of course

“That will not happen

“Of course not. But

“It is not as dear as the glove cleaner. No

The horizon gleamed with a sterility usually reserved for more dire and artificial moments. I said her name twice and then once more: “Isabella, for I was bred into a modest life with people who suspected that there were no better things than what they had already been presented with. My families prominence had dispelled the need for convention- we were of a fortunate lineage and we lived properly but still on terms that we created for ourselves.  The afternoon’s wake had crashed long before we had wound up together beneath the spruce and I was starting to wonder what forces were at play.  I stood up and offered her my hand. “We should go before it gets too dark-I’m not as familiar with this side of the river.” I could smell the cedar that my father had cut into logs burning on the other side of the river; I was certain the estate was farther away. My Mother would always worry when I was gone for too long, but I was incensed with a desire that I had never felt before. I stood and brushed off the red and yellow leaves that had torn as I was lying on them. I offered her my hand as she still remained silent; I wished to get inside of her mind, feel her desire, swim in her thoughts- as if by doing so would make her existence even more real; surely there was a sequence of words to un-muddle  her mind. She looked up at me and smiled. The right strap on her purple sundress had fallen down her shoulder and her high cheekbones rose in such a way that made her eyes squint slightly. “Come, and lie back down- we have at least thirty minutes of sunlight left.” I didn’t want to refuse her, so I laid back down resting my head on a log that had been softened by rain. She rested her head on my chest, and listened to the birds sing beneath an ethereal moon that was starting to appear in the still light, I still believed. She had barely enough strength to say anything, and I still don’t know what to make of it. “I chuckled nervously and said something ridiculous like “yeah well that sure is something” “You’re adorable

I was sprinting through the mansion, I ran out of my previous luck, it ripped open the closet door and then it happened. Game over. I exit the game and got off my computer, so I could get myself a Coke. While on my way out my room and to the kitchen, I began hearing a... Scratching noise, coming from in the walls. I ignored it, hence, I get paranoid. As I opened the fridge, and returned to my room. The scratching had stopped

I woke up to the sound of my alarm, while struggling to drag myself out of bed. When I got up, it instantly struck me, it was Saturday. I slapped the off button of the alarm, and went to my computer. I kicked the button and it came to life, I left the room and went to the kitchen to make myself some coffee. The scratching, it started again. ""GO AWAY!"" I shouted at the walls, I just sprinted out of my apartment as fast as I could, I just wanted the scratching to stop.

When I arrived to my friend's house, it was 6:23 AM, clearly he wouldn't be up by then. I walked to the back of his house and grabbed his spare key that he always hid underneath his plant, then I then unlocked the door and walked in. I walked into his kitchen, opened the fridge, and grabbed a can of Coke, I was too lazy to go buy some of my own. Then I started hearing footsteps, and he looked rather shocked. ""What the hell are you doing here so early?"" said Andy, and for three hours we watched TV, shocked... I forgot to turn off my computer

When I entered that apartment, my fridge had it's contents spilled onto the floor, my pictures were shattered... It was rather horrible. I called the police and told them there may be a possible intruder, and sure enough, moments later a police vehicle stopped at the sidewalk and two police officers exit the vehicle. They entered my apartment, searched the place for any broken windows, and found nothing. They went to ask for witnesses by speaking to my neighbors, madam, thank you for your time..."" The officer entered my apartment, he seemed to get uncomfortable. He simply told me he didn't want to receive calls from me again

Since I was young I had always found closure in the river next to my home.  I would always go and camp by the riverside whenever I had the chance.  The feeling was like no other to get away from the business of life and relax in the stillness that nature had to offer.  
I recall one time I went camping.  The day started off like every other day, rhythmic splashes of the river.  The sound put my mind into a trance as I tried to shake the sleepiness that the morning brings.  While standing still I heard the giggling of a group of girls.  An early morning tubing brigade was in the making.  One could tell just by looking at this group that this was not their first time around the bend.  There were about four of them, each with their individual coolers that were probably not filled with pop and bottled water.  
Knowing the history of the Crow Wing River I assumed that these girls were going to slowly float down to the bridge trying to catch an early morning buzz.  With each empty beer they would gossip about boys and try to one up each other with their “personal” experiences.  I had to chuckle softly to myself
I turned my back to the river and headed for my cooler, some venison steaks, and a freezer bag of premade pancakes.  I pulled out the pancakes and opened the bag. A brief smell of stale bread brushed my nose, but I was too hungry to care.  I sat in my folding chair as I ate my breakfast.  While I sat and ate, I listened to the music of the woods.  The birds were singing their good morning song, the trees creaking to the light wind that wisped over the land.  I ate half of the bag of pancakes and threw the rest into the woods so the birds could have breakfast as well.
I started to clean up my camp a bit and get ready for the day’s activities.  I had planned on tubing the river that day, slowly wading in to check the water.  The water was cold, but not shockingly cold.  I was only knee deep in the water and I threw my tube in.  With beer in hand I submerged my body underneath the water.  There was a momentary pain in my trunks, but it went away fast as my whole body was chilled.  I came up next to my tube and climbed in.  The sun was beaming down on my body and it felt good on my freshly chilled skin.  I started rowing with my hands trying to find the right spot in the river where I could just sit and let the current do all the work. 
 I made my way down the river, grades, football and girls.  I, not knowingly, entered the first of many bends in the river and became stuck on the edge.  On one side there was a forest filled with brush and on the other was a small meadow where deer were known to bed.  I was brought back from my thoughts as I was stuck for a short while.  When I looked up I was presented with a picturesque scene.  A faun was jumping around in the meadow, happy to be alive.  I could tell it was young from the spots it still had.  The faun seemed to have not a care in the world, rolling in the grass that grew thick in the meadow.  I slowly pushed off from the shore, yet midway through I had to cough.  The noise shook the little deer and its ears perked up.  The faun found my position in the river and I froze solid
I started to think of the faun, yet it overcame that fear so it could play and be happy.  I was transfixed by this topic until the river brought me to a group of five children; all of them not older then thirteen.  They were swinging from a rope tied onto a tree that grew over the river.  They were taking turns grabbing onto the rope and swinging into the water.  Nothing could break their happiness.  They were laughing as each one hit the water and came up with a huge grin.  As I watched I thought how lucky they were, to be young and not care about the stresses that I had to endure.  All they knew was that swinging off the rope into the river was fun and that is all they needed to know.  
I made my way farther down the river still thinking about the faun and the children when I came across a tree that had fallen into the river.  I put my hands in the water and maneuvered around the fallen tree.  As I passed I started wondering how that could be, not able to do anything about it.  They wait for their roots to give out and just the right amount of wind to push them over.  All they can do is sit and wait for their demise.  
The current then took me farther down the river and I could see my destination.  My destination was Mary Brown Bridge.  The bridge was covered in graffiti from each graduating class of the surrounding schools.  As I came closer I could hear the slurred yelling from the group of girls that left before me.  They were standing on the side of the bridge jumping into the river like it was their job.  After each one would jump they would whoop and holler, and I stumbled my way up onto the bridge.  The girls noticed my presence and beckoned me to join them in their end of float fun.  As I walked to the side of the bridge fear overcame my body.  The risk of drowning subdued me from jumping as I placed my hands on the wall and looked down at the water.  The river was high this year so the current was really strong, especially under the bridge.
My legs started to buckle in fear as the girls provoked me to jump.  I started thinking about the children that didn’t care if they got hurt jumping into the river; they were having too much fun.  I thought of the faun and how it overcame its fear so it could frolic around, how it was alive one day and gone the next.  The risk of drowning started to die down and courage arose within me.  Life is too short to not take risks, to not have fun.  I then got up on the edge of the bridge, the girls started to cheer, and I jumped.

	I never wanted this... I thought by leaving Earth I could escape the shitty lot in life I had, where I found work for one of the science research teams there. I really enjoyed Ceres, I could have stayed there for quite a while, but just like everything else that’s ever gone right for me, it was crushed. An experiment involving a miniscule amount of anti-matter while I was off-duty completely destroyed our lab, putting me out of work, thankfully I had made enough off of my research to finally get me to Jupiter. That’s where I’m headed now, one devoted to science and discovery

--The Seventh Column--

	“The Seventh Column will be departing in 10 standard minutes.” announced the robotic voice of the loudspeaker, where it was quiet and peaceful. I had to return to Mars to find a ship that could take me to Jupiter, big ships like that never stop at Ceres. The Seventh Column was the cheapest ride I could find, well within my tight budget of 6 billion credits. I already had a job waiting for me on the Jovian Platform Scipio, a well paying job researching anti-matter physics, just like on Ceres. The only difference is that Scipio has real funding, with much better equipment than I could’ve dreamed of on Ceres. 

	“The Seventh Column will be departing in 5 standard minutes.”came from the loudspeaker as I checked and made sure I had everything, and judging by the number of footsteps, this was a group of people. I looked up, and three men were standing in front of me. Rugged, worn by space travel, they had probably never seen the light of Earth. 

	“Are you Isav Re’e?” asked the man on my right

	“Yes

	“We’ve been looking for you... You were stupid to come back here.” said the man on my left, with a dot in the center. He was from the Maln Clan, who I worked for briefly before I left Mars the first time. I left on not so pleasant terms, too.

	“Shuttup, we don’t want a mess here. Come with us peacefully and we’ll make sure you aren’t hurt. If you don’t comply then... I can’t guarantee your safety.” I was in a bind, I had less than five minutes so if I left I’d miss the flight, and lose my job on Jupiter, but if I tried to stay, these guys would drag me out by force. I needed to act quickly.

	“Alright, where no-one was stationed.

	“Alright, as they began to follow me back. They had taken the bait, now I just had to reel them in. I did some quick mental predictions and chose the one with the best chances. I reached up and grabbed a large bag, and as I pulled it down I slammed it into Ronin’s face, knocking him out instantly. I dove behind a shelf and grabbed another bag, this one a little smaller, perfect to use with one hand. I waited for the other two to round the corner until I threw the bag at the other cronnie while I tripped the leader. As soon as his head hit the ground I slammed my fist upwards into his nose, and stuffed their bodies in a small nook of an access corridor. 

	I got back to my seat as two crew members were coming towards me. They were asking all the passengers about something

	“Excuse me sir, showed me a Holopane with the image of the three men who attacked me. My face went hot, my head started spinning, but I was able to compose myself.

	“No

	“They requested to come see someone on the ship

	“Can’t you check the surveillance to see if they did come out?”

	“Afraid not, correct?” said Czevk.

	“That’s right

	“Alright

	“Maybe they slipped by you and you didn’t notice. You guys were preparing to set off right?”

	“Yeah, let’s go. I’m ready to get out of here.” He looked back at me, “Thanks for co-operating, Mr.?”

	“Young. Dr. Isais Carson Young.” I replied.

I frantically bombard the walls that have become my prison.  Panic sets in as tiny fragments of light stream in.  Is it just me or are these walls sweating?  It’s as if the walls are alive, anticipating.  

Moments ago my antennae was deep inside a particularly fragrant and productive pollen mine.  Pink with streaks of white

There is a high pitched noise that I have suddenly become aware of.  An indecipherable amalgamation of sounds, they call it. 

I must escape!  Using the only tool available to me I unleash my weapon stabbing the walls in a desperate attempt to break through the impenetrable fortress.  Once.  Twice.  This is fruitless.

Now the walls are moving, the temporary release.  All of it was done as a lead up to this moment.  I can hear the voice repeating those fateful words.

Pushing through the sky like a bottle opener into a cork, they come into being in a different space, while leaving other parts to wisp away into the wind. They pulse and breathe. They hold you for a moment and then release you. Inside the cloud there’s a magic, a concrete feeling of luscious glory that lasts momentarily before I exit. Clouds come and go as do I, entering and exiting them at a velocity best described as wonderful but dizzying. 

The ground is closer and more real than ever, the kids and the bills and the security of others. Someone who doesn’t just give you the thrill and leave you, something that doesn’t feel like a one night stand. Time to plant your feet on solid ground. 

I fall, and slowly rotate so I fall looking at the sky. Looking at where I was, seeing how far I’ve come and wishing I was one minute ago, three days ago, 6 months ago. Being dropped is terrible, falling is exhilarating, but finding ground again…

Finding ground again is frightening. The idea of walking around miles below where you were and having to work to get back up here to the sky: well honestly it’s goddam awful. I want to be up in the sky again already, right now I’m falling; falling increasingly faster and faster. The ground is rushing at me, that which was so unimportant only a moment ago is now so very important. 

I think of what it took to get here. The training, the checking of gas, wheels, equipment, radio, wings, instruments, above it all

Oh god the parachute. I touch the cord handle of the cord and recall this fall isn’t like the others. I’ve been here before, I pull my feet up and I pull the cords by me and I look and I scream, my mouth opens wide and it all comes flying out of me. I slide through high grass going far too fast; my body instinctively curls up and I roll along the ground cracking bones, bruising ribs, and generally fucking up my body. I inhale dirt and scrape a gash on my shin that deposits blood on the ground every few feet. The roll last 6 seconds, but I feel like I’ve been tumbling for months. Dust is everywhere and the cloud billows up around me as I finally come to rest on the ground. 

Broken, busted up and generally destroyed on every level of existence. I cough and blood mixes into the bare grass around me and I contemplate laying here forever. The sun is fading in the west I look over at it, and I watch, laying down in a mixture of brown, red, green, and yellow and realize that there’s nothing that has to happen, and then one foot at a time, a lifetime of a moment

Those two sentences have always haunted me, waking up screaming in the middle of the night without knowing why, just hearing those words echoing throughout my mind. By the time I was seven, I’d been to four different psychiatrists. None of them helped. I never had any friends, because no one wants to be friends with a pale, twitchy, wide-eyed boy who was known for flipping out in the middle of class, even back then as a kid. I knew the truth, war

The truth.

I finally realized what I had known my whole life two days ago. I was at my job. I worked in a small store. We had food, took inventory, cleaned, whatever was needed of me. It was glamorous, but it paid the rent on my apartment with enough left over for bills and food. On this day, two days ago, a teenage boy, came into the store. His young, strolling past me again. I grabbed his shoulder, the blow to my head finally revealing what had been hidden. The malevolent glitter in his eyes

I’ve been in my apartment since then, loaded and ready to destroy any and all of the creatures. A few have knocked, but I wont let them in. A few have even called out, mimicking the voices of my neighbors. They’ve been growing increasingly urgent. They fear me. Good. My fear is over. I understand. 

I understand.
I finally understand why that phrase has taunted me.
It was as though it was written for me. 

I sit alone in my apartment, banging on the door. Claim to be police. Obviously they want to kill me. I won’t let them. I’m the only one left. Or was I the only one there ever was? They’re knocking. Go away. Go away! I won’t let them in!

Nobody knew how or when the dusty behemoth of a vehicle ended up where it was. All that was known was that it had been there for years on end, Matthew fit the part with a pair of dusty overalls and a tank top worn underneath. Scrawny to the letter and hiding his eyes behind a tangled mess of sweat-laced hair, it seemed

Sighing, Matthew walked to the front of the truck and leaned back. The cold metal of the grill met his back with a smack and Matthew soon found himself sliding to sit with his knees propped up. Dropping his head back, he let it rest on the truck's grill as he gazed into the night sky. Earth had been a sight back whenever he had first lived there. The large white moon above with stars littering the sky had kept him rather enraptured as a young boy. At the age of twenty-seven, however, Matthew found the night sky of Plethora to be a bit lackluster. There was no moon, only stars. The sky wasn't even that dark here. A darker shade of red, perhaps, Matthew looked down once more at the rifle he held. At least he'd be found soon. People would be out and about in an hour at the latest.

Forgotten was the rifle and his previous resolution, the old weapon hitting the ground with a dull clang compared to the sudden rush of noise and action around the man. Whenever his vision cleared up, Matthew went wide-eyed with disbelief. There before him, was the lapdog of the Unified Colony Directorate. Aiden Desparius, evading a stray rifle's bullet. Muscles tightened and flexed as he punched one farmer, Matthew raised it shakily to his shoulder and aimed at the soldier fighting his people. Unseen

They were to be the last two words Matthew heard in his current life. Seeing Aiden vanish before his eyes, as most did, and did his best to run before the soldier reappeared. He wasn't quick enough. Aiden reappeared explosively, his body forming in midair in the space that Matthew inhabited. Vitae and organs spread like a rain, Matthew's body unable to contain the sudden stress of someone else occupying the exact space it did. The poor man's master plan for dying peacefully and with a proper funeral were shattered in the same instant that Matthew simply ceased to exist. It didn't take long for Aiden to finish his compatriots after their morale shattered, seeing such gruesome brutality.

Quietly, Vincis’ domain, and nothing happened in here without his knowledge. She got about halfway to him when he turned his head, looking at her out of the corner of his eye. Impossibly bright and blue, eyes he got from his father, much to his dismay. 

“H-Hey, but she noticed the attempt. It was enough in her book. “I’m s-sorry. Was I m-making t-too much noise?”

She smiled at him, and neatly checked him with her hip. “What are you working on?” And instantly, she could see the way Vincis’ features, which had just started to relax, tighten up again. He turned back forward, gesturing with his hand to the car before them, lips dipping into a frown. 

“I c-can’t figure out wh-what’s wrong with it. I’ve tried everyth-thing.” Here, especially with greasy hands, when he was truly upset. Vincis tended to view cars as puzzles - and if he couldn’t fix one….well. 

This was his talent. If he were incapable of fixing a car, not the big things. Launch an idea at him that might terrify another man, and he handled it like a champ. Give him a car he couldn’t fix?

*Excerpt From Brown Baggers:*  	It was funny that we were the only employees who were brown baggers. Everybody else in the facility spent their lunch hour in the long food court lines
	Me and him -sorry- him and I sat in the back right corner, obese security guard ate chicken nuggets with onion rings (everyday, mind you) and finally a table where small gaggle of blonde secretaries howled youthful giggles and gossiped their lunch hour away. They never brown bagged it either. Always had meal shakes and salads. Always complaining. Always. Complaining about their boyfriends, about the food they ate, about the suits they shredded, ran coffee runs for and blew regularly.  
	The Suits. Of course none of the suits ate in the cafeteria
	Today, my lovely wife had packed me a ham sandwich. Wheat bread, mozzarella cheese, a small layer of spinach leaves. I hate spinach. A bag of reduced calorie cheetos. There was a jello packet. A napkin, a plastic spoon, a small sticky note reminding me that she loves me. I really do hate spinach, wish she'd tell me she loved me by conveniently forgetting to put that on my god damn sandwich. 
	Richard slumped his pumpkin shaped body into the seat next to me without saying a word. I bit down into my sandwich instead of saying hello. We exchanged a sort of greeting with bobbing heads. He dropped a brown onto the table in front of him and opened it like one would a letter they'd been dreading to receive. 
 	An apple. A napkin. A can of coke. A packet of oreos. And a small plastic bag of cold pizza. Missing was a note reminding him he was loved. 
	""Cold pizza."" Richard mumbled
	I laughed. Not because it was funny
	Richard coughed as he opened his warm coke
	""How was it this morning?"" I asked
	I wiped away some spinach on my lip. 
	""No."" Richard whispered. He took another chug of his coke before he began to tear open his Oreos.
	""There wasn't much fight left in him after everything you did to him."" Richard continued
	""What can I say? The victims parents wanted it rough. So I gave it to him rough."" I boasted
	""What was that thing you did to the poor guys balls?"" Richard asked
	""Twisted them. The mother's request. 'twist them 'til the sack pops
	Richard ate the rest of his Oreo and began to speak with his mouth full, did you have any idea you'd be touching more balls than a common whore.""
	I laughed. Again, day in and day out I was squeezing them, shocking them, cutting them and even, on occasion, burning them. Big hairy skin brains, and it was my responsibility to destroy them for Uncle Sam. Really isn't the ideal career I wanted to grow up to be. 
	""How was Peterson by the time he got to your office?"" I asked
	He returned with a question: ""Did you read my part of the request form?"" 
	""The rules state I'm not aloud to read your section of the request form.""
	""Company policy also says I'm supposed to wash my hands for a full minute before and after contact with blood
	Richard had devoured his second Oreo and had begun struggling to eat the stone triangle of a pizza out of the limp plastic bag.
	""Tell me Richard
	""Nothing special. Just a drowning. Slow drowning. He was begging for it after everything you'd done to him.""

But what have ‘they’ ever really known.  



I just like the rain is all: its sound; its energy; its beauty. And it’s smell…  



Again



‘They’ say a lot of things. But I guess if you say enough



Thirty-six years of marriage… There was a lot of rain drops in those thirty-six years. Some of the happiest times in my life with him… and some of the darkest…  



Thirty-six years of roses.  
Thirty-six years of sunsets and sunrises.  
Thirty-six years of puddles and rainbows.  
Thirty-six years of lies



It was raining so hard the first day we met. We were just kids then



I’ll never forget…  



Out of the blue one day he asked me in class to go to the park with him. He said with that stupid grin on his face, neither of us knowing quite what to say to the other. Neither of us was ever any good at small talk. He grabbed my hand, and nearly pulled my arm off as he shifted direction off the path. We stumbled through the brush and into a small clearing, a meadow. We just stood there staring at each other. Every time I tried to ask what he was doing or planning he just smiled and pressed his hand gently to my lips to get me to stop talking. Finally he let out a big sigh, leaned back and breathed deep through his nose. Seconds later the skies opened up and it just started pouring buckets. I shrieked and he just laughed that careless stupid chuckle of his…  



Years later, just off his porch with his arms tilted back, face to the sky… Just letting the rain hit him in the face. Couldn’t tell anymore if there were tears in his eyes or just rain drops. Just stood there, face contorted as if someone had stabbed him, letting the rain try to just wash it all away. Damn fool was going to catch cold and get sick. But there was no way I was going to let him win. No way I was walking back to him, not this time… I was so sure of myself then and there… But I am a sucker for his smile…  



Our wedding day. I was so nervous, like I said, I never trusted ‘them’. What if it wasn’t true love? What if it was just him and me being stupid, and young… I was so worried, so full of doubts I never even made it to the church. He found me about 10 minutes after the wedding was spose to have started. I was just standing there, in my dress, in our meadow. He knew exactly where to look. Rain had already blown in from the south-east. ‘They’ say that’s bad luck on your wedding day… but what have ‘they’ ever known…  



Three years later, anger, confusion, and tears. His face changed so many different emotions and colors before he just smiled that big dopey smile of his. He tilted his head back and just screamed for joy and let the rain wash away his tears and his scared emotions. We were going to be a family…  



I slammed the door shut on the taxi. Told the driver to take me home



This was it, I am always a sucker for his smile…  



The wind picked up and sent the rain crashing into the hospital window. The doctor said it was cancer. Said it was terminal. This time, I don’t wanna leave him… I held his hand. Told him it would be ok. I couldn’t stop crying. He laughed his stupid dopey laugh and said that wasn’t very reassuring. Tears streaming down his face and he smiled that stupid little smile of his. The one were even his eyes smile. “I love you.” He said. “I am so sorry…” I said. I just held his hand as he left…  



Thirty-six years of roses.  
Thirty-six years of sunsets and sunrises.  
Thirty-six years of puddles and rainbows.

Jaclyn
We were together for 8 magical years.  Three blessed years of marriage.  Every moment was amazing.  It had its ups and downs but no one in the world could doubt our love.    Nothing in the world matter besides you, the doctor took you from me and told me to wait in the lobby.  Four hours of pacing, four hours of never knowing what was coming next, no notice of progress or status.  Then the nurse came out and said, “Mr. MacRory, please come with me.”  I was brought to a hallway and shown a little girl in a pink cap and socks.  My daughter, Melody, I had never felt such joy.  Then it all came crashing back.  I was told there were complications with the birth and that my wife, before your heart gave out.  I had to place you in the ground the same week that I had to care for our new and lovely daughter.   It was the ultimate perversion.  The joy in seeing my daughter, my wife who was not here to enjoy these moments.  I went to your grave every night for 3 months and stared at that piece of rock that was all I had left of you.  I struggled to keep a grip on my life for a bit

I lost you 33 years ago.  I never once took off my wedding band.  I lay here in my hospital bed knowing I will finally get to see you soon.  Melody is working around the clock trying to find something to slow the cancer eating at my body, but she has your stubbornness built deep inside her.  I looked at that picture of you every night before I went to bed and talked to you, told you about my day and what was troubling me, knowing you would have known the right thing to say every time.  I wish I had that picture with me now.  Looking at your beautiful face would always ease my fears.   Childish as it seems, I fear the end.  I always feared the unknown.  Tomorrow though I will be back in your arms a place that seems so far off and yet so familiar it seems like I last kissed you a few minutes ago.  I have, since our first moment together, loved you.  After losing you all those years ago, and I will continue loving you into whatever awaits me.  ""After all

Your loving and dedicated husband

It was had been four years now



I thought back to it all. The violence. The beauty. Your panicked breath washing over the skin on my neck, but I deny myself from giving in completely to the fury of it all. The dance, while still skillfully executed, typically contains no emotion. I could make rivers and lakes with what I have done, so what is just one more bucket?    



Sure the first time engulfed me. It fueled my desires. Eviscerated with every last second of the moment. It happened all so fast, irregular and desperate...    



And with you it wasn't any different—though thousands of times this ritual plotted, I heard the echo of your heartbeat. Time was not in control, I was. You had surrendered completely, accepting your role entirely. You had your part to play, though you tried to rob me of it. Foolish, but still what more could have been expected of you? So fiery, so stubborn, and the acrid scent in my nostrils. I don't have to imagine it



I watched as your eyes glassed. I stayed to watch you paint the floor. Each and every last brush stroke



Ah yes. Autumn.

The sound was muted (he wanted to smash the TV once he realized he'd been watching commercials without thinking) and his mother was asleep in the next room.

He didn't know how long ago it had happened, so was his sense of time.

The images were fresh in his mind, the creatures that had descended upon them....fierce, mindless, fearless, countless hordes of vile abominations destroying anything in sight.

One such creature happened upon the mans family. The man, the taste of blood in his mouth....the cries of panic and dismembering of his family from the fiendish monster.

And the blood...everywhere blood....the screams....and then nothing.....

He then awoke in the strange place on his world that he wanders to this day and has wandered ever since that day. Where everything that he held dear....his meaning

Everyday was the same to him. He had not felt the mortal desires in the years or days or minutes it had been since that first day. He had not felt hunger, there would be no peace in death.

Nor, wandering hopelessly, had no where to go, and had no idea why he was going there. Everyday was the same to him.

Everyday was the same

This day, moments later, pain beset the man. Today, he felt as if he had not eaten in years, his stomach ached for nourishment, his throat felt dry and gasped for relief. His legs, after regaining feeling, gave way, and he felt the cries and pain of an entire world besiege his being

""I can make all your pain go away, the anguish will be purged from your body....""


Startled by the forbodeing* voice, he tried to ask with a dry mouth "" Who...who is....this? What is....happening?"" But nothing came to from his efforts.

""Think of me as your savior, and knowing no light with me....""

The man barely understood what the voice was saying, needed, the pain to subside, and it seemed this was his only way out. To stop the pain, stop the greiving, stop feeling again....

And so, not at all realizing he no longer seemed to be on his own broken world, but instead what seemed to be nothingness. The man quietly whispered with heavy heart, his body beaten and broken "" Take...the pain...away... I beg of y-you....""

He could feel the darkness pulse with a sense of satisfaction at his response while he waited for what would happen next. The man felt a dark hand reach deep within himself that started to pick away at his soul..... stripping away his memories, quite painfuly. He felt his very being being taken from his body, making him less and less human every second that went by since his response.

At the same time, serinity of you will, of the greif being lifted up and out of his body, the cries of the millions being deafend just an iota at a time...his desire for food, sleep, water also being removed from his body. After who knows how long, the man allowed a brief smile to spread across his face....

...only for that smile to curl into a scowl of disatisfaction at the burning sensation began filling his body. His veins seemed to fill with knives flowing through his blood stream

But no such relief came to the man. His mouth felt a thirst ten times than that felt mere seconds ago

And even if that wasn't enough for the pain stricken man. He felt and grief and sorrow of the millions of deaths of his home decend upon him, being ripped from his body one by one, each one more painful than the last.

As the pain worsened, rapeing him from within of his humanity. A grim realization came over the man as he had realized what he had done.

The tranistion, reached a painful climax, tearing into the man like a tempest of a thousand hells, ripping his soul asunder, pulling his flesh from his bones. As the final portion of the transformation began, the man was allowed to see who he had aggreed to save save him, and upon gazing into the darkness at the face of the purgatory he was in

""There is no turning back now my child....you are now apart of my darkness. My. Nothing.""

And with that, the man bellowed forth a blood letting scream, to the fill the ears of no one....and as the scream echoed through the darkness and faded away, the broken and beaten world was left in silence, devoid of all life, with no one left to wander its wastelands any longer......",,,,

Thomas Joseph lived in a small farming town. He knew all of his neighbors and half of them were his relatives. He lived in a house that was surrounded by trees and had an old wood barn in the back. He didn’t have the biggest house in the town and hardly anyone paid attention to him and the property he inherited from his long passed relatives.

Thomas went into town and bought paint to paint his house. He thought that if there was a change to the way it looked, but also for his shed in the back. He painted them both yellow because he couldn’t think of a color that would attract more attention than something as bright and glamorous.

Thomas spent many days painting his house. He didn’t ask for any help from his friends and neighbors because he thought that if he got it done all by himself then it would make it look like he worked harder on it

In truth, expecting someone to comment on his house without him telling them. When he finally got annoyed with the lack of responses, he said “I got a new color on my house. Did you see it yet?” However, no one really cared about his house. They didn’t even know he painted it or that anything new had even happened to it.

When Mr. Joseph got home
That same evening

When he returned to his house, the effect would be diminished. If the tailor didn’t measure him correctly, the suit could be ruined and it would make him look trashy if it didn’t fit. 
Throughout the week, except for the Tailor sending him a letter asking about how the pockets should be. Mr. Joseph was still upset but he was willing to wait. 

When Wednesday came, Mr. Joseph returned home. 

But he wasn’t done yet. He had one thing in mind that would get him the attention of all of his friends and neighbors. 

Mr. Joseph went into the barn, and sure enough, neighbors started coming. His ego burned with anticipation. 
Cars lined up all the way down the street of people who were curious about what was happening and willing to help. They saw Mr. Joseph in his new suit and the new paint on his house

There was not much they could do to save his house. After the trees around his house caught fire, and that did not make the townspeople think highly of him. 

TL;DR: Guy wants to impress everyone with his new suit. Ends up catching his house on fire.

Today I was awoken from my dreamless sleep by the cry of my child. This is not unordinary as he is an infant. He cried for a minute
The time on the clock flashed 9:48am. Without fail every morning, just an inch. No more than that to glance a peek. ""It's a gift to see your child when they are unaware of you."" I say absently to myself.
There he is. Eyes wide with wonder for what is to come of today. Sleepy eyes, then right. He whimpers. 
""is he whimpering for breakfast? For more sleep? Possibly he just wants out of his crib to play and investigate all his toys spread across his room?"" I ponder. 
The floor creaks at where I stand. I step back to hide my face through the small crack in the door. The perfectly round head peaking over his crib and big brown eyes snap in my direction. Its too late. He saw me. A loud whine escapes his small soft lips. A cry for his mama.

The next few weeks I seemed to see Kaylee everywhere.  I wasn’t sure if this was new or she had always been there and I had simply started looking for her.  I got good at coming up with excuses to talk to her

At first, always telling her she was gorgeous and how sexy she looked in her new coat.  If it was a lie she told, it had her husband convinced and that was all we needed.

She would come over to watch movies at my place. She would sit next to me on my couch, she would always pick one of her favorite movies and watch me as I watched the screen, checking to see if I enjoyed it as much as she did.  I always played my part well, insisting it was one of my favorite movies and telling her the lead actor was born to play that role. On my nights, I always picked romantic films hoping to trigger some thought or feeling about me she might have been ignoring.  When the credits rolled, I’d ask her how she liked it and she insisted it was very good. Perhaps we were both doing the same dance.

This went on for weeks before I decided alcohol would go much better with the movies than popcorn.  I poured her a glass and we turned on my movie, feeling all the doubt about her I had wash away, and I told Kaylee I liked her too.  As she smiled, I moved close giving her a kiss. She hesitated for a moment then kissed me back.  After weeks, the tension between us was broken and the single kiss turned into passion.

Holding her close I slowly stripped away her clothes, which for weeks we sat silently thinking about this very moment.  She moaned and squirmed like a virgin, but surely a married woman couldn’t be.  Perhaps she had never really been satisfied.  Despite my excitement and anticipation, I took my time, absorbing every moment knowing it could be the only time she would be mine.  I held her close, kissing her neck, feeling her gentle breaths and quiet moans

We found ourselves in my bed.  Never bothering to put our clothes back on

The next morning I wake to her putting her shoes on and I knew our night together was finally over.  I tried to think of words that would keep her from leaving, and I would lay there thinking how helpless in love I am…with a married woman.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,

“I remember one day of winter, I couldn’t have been taller than I am now.” He looks to me with a smile. “We spent the entire day by the hill behind Wilson’s house. We took sleds and lids down that hill, trying to guide it down to an alley so we could go the farthest. We didn’t stop till we saw a couple girls from school cutting through the alley. Linda Mould and Susan P. Cole,” He turns to me with a special grin. Susan P. Cole was my grandmother.

“I jumped line when I saw them, never do at that age. No one did in those days.” Something in his voice changes. The mist in his eyes is more of a water haze now, he points to the empty horizon. “I use to see homes, grass, animals, and clouds. I never new that hope for the future was artificial till the mechanics of the world were stripped from us. It didn’t matter what we did to try and stop it neither.” I can see him slipping into more painful memories so I request him to point out when exactly he noticed the world changing first hand. 

“Changes? Well them happen often and often.” (He means to say changes happen a great deal and always.) “Well, but enough to shake you to. Round the time I was leaving college I suppose. I looked around my bed for whoever woke me, Susan hadn’t been over that night so I couldn’t figure out who’d hurt my arm. It was near midday and I had spent the better half of the morning sleeping off the night before. I wanted to sleep some more but the sun was slipping between my blinds and onto the side of my bed. I got up to close the drapes, but first to peak outside. I was looking for anyone of note when I noticed warmth and a near instant sting all over my face. I leapt back and closed the drapes. I felt relief right away. I knew it, right then, I knew it. The sun was burning like they said it was, hot and fast. My first thought was to call Susan and see if she was feeling it too.”

It’s not long after that our history lessons pick up, spend entire months ruining chalk boards and burrowing floors with his pacing. I nearly didn’t sleep in my time there trying to keep up with him and the three kids at home. No one really knows his name anymore, yet his design saved what’s left of us.” His sigh holds a lot of weight out of his chest. I decide its time to broche a subject that has been refrained from in my family for years now. 

I ask him as gently as possible, he said he just wanted to make sure I made it and hung up. I forced myself out of bed and put these packs of necessities and valuables we had made in case it did come. I heard the kids downstairs playing, I yelled for them to get up and get there stuff ready. They knew what I meant but I don’t think they truly new what it meant.” My father swears it was all too quick to remember. One day your breathing humid air, the next day it’s artificial. Kids his age hardly caught on to the significance of things as they went.

“Once we were all packed I rushed the kids out to the car. It was so bright out I could hardly see my way to the car, Susan! Susan!” His outcry catches me off guard, “I ran back and forth through the aisles still she is not there. I looked to my watch, If I was to save my children I couldn’t wait any longer. I’d have to hope she received the message and caught the follow up busses to one of the others. 

When I returned to car and began to head for my designated dome, nor has our family ever discussed her final whereabouts.

We ran for what seemed like hours, we stopped in a small neighborhood. Three houses stood there seemingly untouched by the madness of what the earth was now. It was a comforting feeling to be back home. We set down our valuables and watched the sun slowly make its dissent over the orange horizon. We felt closer than we ever have before to each other. Quickly afterwards, we all wished each other good night. I lied in my bed wishing for this to be over. Whatever “this” was, I don’t know. 

The next morning

The rest of my group awoke

The morning sun was beautiful, but when we did, It was certainly a touchy subject. You can only joke and play around for so long before conversion turns serious. It’s what we needed to keep sane, none the less, as we walked on this abandoned interstate. The hours were long, but I felt as if we were coming up to something big..something worth our while. Just then, our leader, raised his binoculars that hung around his neck. He trembled as he said

We stopped and gazed in awe of what we saw, but before I could make it, a married couple from my group had already beaten me there and had sunken into the gelatin-made streets. It was the most peculiar thing we had all ever seen, but at the same instant, it was beautiful. We laughed, and we became children again. I didn’t look back or even think of the home that I left behind.

Her voice sounded intelligent enough.  She was probably a student

""Why do you ask?"" he replied.  

""You're lying on a concrete wall at eleven-thirty at night.""  

""I've seen people lying around here before.""  

""...in the daytime

He paused for a second.  ""Well

She studied him before replying.  He was in his early or mid twenties, he wasn't really sleeping on the wall; he was just lying there with his eyes open in his shorts, a button-up shirt, and sandals, at eleven-thirty on Saturday night.  

""So you understand
  
""I suppose so.""   

""...and?""  

""Have you ever had the feeling that you're different than everyone else?""  

""Well

""No, I'm talking about really, completely different than everyone around you.""  He spoke as if he were having a sort of revelation on the spot--as if nothing that he was saying had ever occurred to him before that moment.  ""Like, as if your brain works differently in the way that it comes to conclusions, and your priorities are completely different than everyone else's.""  

She paused before replying ""Is that why you're lying on a concrete wall under a tree at eleven-thirty at night?  Because you're different?""  
""I suppose that's one reason

""Why's that?""  

""Well, though.""  

""I meant for you to tell me what this supposed 'biggest problem' you're facing right now is.""  

""At this exact moment?"" he inquired.  

""At this exact moment"" she replied.  

""At this exact moment
""I'm sorry

""No

""Okay

""Well, meaningful relationship with anyone.  Ever.""  He spoke in a fairly monotone voice, but somehow it seemed as though he was just barely maintaining his grip on the present.  As if just thinking about the subject caused him inexpressible horror.  She saw the way he lay across the concrete, with as much of his body touching it as possible, and it seemed that he was rooted to the earth in such a way to compensate for his mind's desire to flee.  

""What do you mean by 'deep

""I mean...well, and I hang out with some of them, but at the end of the day, I can't really depend on any one of them.  They'd like me to think that I can, but I really can't, and when I need them they all seem to disappear.  It's like...I don't know, like everything is plastic.  Fake.  The world is a set of social rules that I have to follow in order to be normal, deep

""Well
""You'd think so.  I did.  But I must always end up bending or breaking one of those social rules.  Or maybe I'm completely and unforgivably disobeying one that I don't even know about.  And because of that, and the first time it rains everything gets soggy and unreadable, then just breaks apart, because there's no real substance to it.""  

""And that's why you're lying here?""  

""Yes.""  

""On a concrete wall.""  

""Yes.""   

""At eleven-thirty at night.""  

""Yes.""  

""Because you feel like your friendships are all disintegrating and there's nothing you can do to stop it.""  

""Yes.  Well---no.  Not exactly.  It's like, that and the lack of a real, meaningful relationship with another human being.""  

She paused for a moment, she scooted down the concrete wall another foot and a half or two, then lay down so that their bodies made a line, separated by six inches of space between the point where his head ended and hers began.

When I was young

From outside Atlanta in the sweaty eves to shivering in the awnings at Gare L’est. I am 15

-Not this one
-Rock, I joke.

Wait, panting and dizzy. Beyond us in the peninsula, the sea beating foam and white against the granite. I measure sides of granite sliding into the ocean in degrees. 37, 49. It was two years ago since we came here. 

-Come on

We cross the end of the of the road and navigate through the boulders and cacti along the path. As we descend, the tide pool is a dark black. I slow, tie the dog to a branch and regard the gleaming layer. For some reason my reflection is nothing more than a dull figurine. The dog whimpers. I reach out with my hand.

And then I vanish.

I am 19

And then I vanish.

Alexandra always regarded me with caution. We are at dinner. I am 28. I know our marriage won’t last I know she is gaining weight. I know my hair is starting to recede. I am not as fast as I used to be. I still stand straight, forget how we used to be and make vague promises. Land to spread out, air to breathe, a literary life. She turned me to Nabokov and Kinglsey Amis. She taught me that Russian beers are numbered to reflect your drunkenness. She excuses herself from the table, and suddenly the room changes. I see visions of myself stumbling in from every door. I am confused, because just one second ago I was here and I saw this. It lead me to that and now here I am. We shake, trying to clear out the fog. The poor bartender opens a few bottles and slides them down the bar. I am a set of ages and lifetimes. We amble, love the same songs.

But no

We did shots of bad vodka, fully loaded with munitions tips over. Meteors and cannonade stream past me. Jeff is 15 and so am I. He darts into the street hollering. I follow. Two bright stars explode. I pause to think. 

The universe tells us that all things are permitted, but a close approximation is staring down the sights of a rifle at a fine looking doe on a chill November morning. I am one ensemble in the sum of possibility and there are others around me, gathered by the void, we snack on tuna and crackers. We bask in the afternoon sun.

So imagine if you will this. I am in a room at the end of a long day, others talk quietly. At first, it was such a shock. Even to hear one’s voice projected in a mass, but now after a couple passes, it seems second nature. I converse with myself, I am 45, 52, divisions of 3

The maitre d’ announces the first course. We precipitate towards tables, sitting on a bed of pine needles. I’ve heard about a distant day from an old friend. About a walk under the Gothic arches of the place I so dearly called home. The creak in my knee is not yet come to pass. The knot in my wrist is only just now begun. I wince at the pinching of nerves and the grinding of joints and the momentary pain awakens me.

I feel as if I can’t breathe, but I believe the next time through I can get it right.

Around me. Like version of Judas, our possibility.

""It had been a particularly cold winter. The white frost blanketed the ground

It was during that desolate winter that I had the pleasure of meeting Joe, I remember thinking that the cold was in him, in those eyes, and he would never escape from it. But I was sillier back then.

I was young. A girl alone in the world, and showed no signs of slowing. I had found it like this and it had stayed like this, as broken and empty as I was.

Most people kept their distance

Until Joe. We met in the cold and it was the cold that sustained us until the frost became too bitter. He had been sleeping in “my” barn, mostly in passing, to check if it was still there, giving it’s sorry condition.

I watched through a spiderweb of cracked and stained glass as he went to and from the barn. I didn’t know where he went

I had been alone for so long by then that his presence wasn’t easily articulated into clear feelings one way or the other. I knew he might be dangerous, and destined to die with a whimper not a bang. So I decided to speak to him, the first person in a long time I felt connected to on any kind of level worth a damn.

How he had been surviving in the barn for this long with it’s missing shingles and barely patched south wall, and the barn wasn’t much protection. I didn’t know how to approach him without scaring him, as I had come to think of him as a solitary fellow, never having seen anyone in his company while he stayed on the ranch.

So I knocked. My knuckles meeting the frayed once-red, my shivering not only a result of the winter wind, but nevertheless he heard. Joe had been a man slow to talk when we first met, but he opened up as our talks grew.

It was around then that I began to realize his eyes were more the blue of the ocean water that I had sometimes dreamed about than frozen ice. We talked of many things, and I laughed along with him. It was the shared laughs more than anything that kept me coming back to that barn for so long. 
He introduced a warmth that didn’t stretch very far but radiated with an unparalleled intensity between the two of us. We spent a month together on that cold farm, and most importantly living.

He and his watery eyes eventually moved on. But those days I kept with me for a very long time. I can still remember the bitter cold in my old bones, until it to was killed off by the frost.""

I hack away furiously at a keyboard, I'm sure that they're for me— and she bursts through the door and slips on the tile for a second, just catching herself. ""Shitshitshit! Come the fuck on! Come on!""

I jump up, all the blood. She looks up at me. She won't make it, and as soon as I realize that, I feel like throwing up. But there's no time.

He is about as angry as someone can get, reaching out desperately with one hand to hook my leg or something. I step back and dart to my bike, still yelling. ""Shit!"" From a few hundred feet behind

The air is freezing. The night is dark. Streetlights and neon pass by as lines of fire; almost nobody is driving. It's terrifyingly empty. About a half hour later, step off of my bike, and collapse into the wall. I can't seem to cry or think about what I'll do next.

Jack reached his arm to the empty space in his bed next to him, was in it's place.

He rubbed the sleep from his eyes and stood up. Groggily wandering around the apartment in his underwear, including a child. But God was not kind and that night, 18 months ago God took her, and the child, in one fell swoop. One bloody swoop that was no accident.

The instrument of this crime was a 6 inch blade, no motive. Jack had been drinking and came home late, only to discover his pregnant wife bloodied and lifeless.

The horror had not sunken in immediately. Jack was not particularly cold, and sadness and he wept until the police arrived.

The investigation lasted for months. But there were no leads, 11th grade english. Who could have been so brutal and why?

That was the question that haunted Jack's mind tonight. He opened the fridge. Condiments. And a half cup of milk. He drank the milk from the carton and tossed it at the trashcan. Jack's mind went to the days before the city

Since then Jack couldn't stand to look at children. He became obsessed with solving the crime even after the police had given up. Picture's of the scene were etched into his mind. He had to clear his head.

Jack dressed and put on a coat and left the apartment. He went trudging down the sidewalk next to brick buildings with only the light of a few sparse lampposts.

As Jack walked he came upon a bum

After several months, and the world of the masses was clouded by all that was mundane. We were trapped.

Until he came.

It was a cool October night, much like all the others, trudging away at my daily tasks to no foreseeable end. I grimaced as I moved onto the next piece of work, knowing that no matter how much effort was applied, the old ones would judge harshly and criticize all distinguishable imperfections. My emotions were boiling, and I would likely have exploded from hatred if it weren't for the start I received from the sudden knocking at my doorway.

I glanced once, almost comical take. A knock on a door meant either banishment or mail – and no one in the institution had received a letter since the beginning of our imprisonment.

The knocking stopped as suddenly as it had started

Hands ashake, absent of physical matter save for the surrounding atmosphere and a small yellow envelope resting at the bottom. I picked it up with haste and slammed my door aclose.

“Student” it said on the front, folded to fit perfectly inside the casing. It read:

“Dear student. Tonight is the night. No more shame

On the back of the note was an address, yet another was “How?” and an equally valid inquiry stood to be “Why?”. I could hear my peers reacting verbally in the cells adjacent to my own. It was clear that many others had also been asked to attend

In a jaded state, and the only thing that mattered was to have it pacified. Thus, I walked.

I behaved mannered and casual on my stroll to the gathering, for the first time in months. I sensed that a strong resolve was approaching. Something positive was on its way.

From the moment I turned the corner onto Bronze Street, my mind adrift in a fantastical trance. “Could this be true?” I thought to myself. “A party amidst such strict elder rule?” But it was.

The house was alive with grog-drenched laughter and the livelihood of socially stimulated youth. My senses told me that I was in heaven

The chatter carried on, daring party? Was it the same man who sent the letter? Why had he done it? I had to discover the identity of the savior of our morale. It was an absolute.

Before I could even begin to search for the answers, their lights droning systemically in the windows and the howl of their sirens tearing through the atmosphere like the chilling scream of a soul reaper. With the blink of my eye came chaos, desperate yells and attempts to escape. No one sought banishment, and no one sought arrest. All sought to be free.

In the midst of the freakout

Several elders had gathered around their law-enforcing subservients, at the chilling vacancy of their stare.

“Step down from the house immediately.” came the megaphone. A lone blue-suit, sound amplifier pointed towards the man atop the house. “You're all under arr...”

“NO!” boomed the man

Again the megaphone called “Come down

“LISTEN TO ME!” he cried. The confidence and surety of his tone were enough to make even his enemies feel proud of him

“This institution...” he began “was created long ago, his voice so absolutely strong that the intensity was palpable. Everyone awaited his continuation.

“Look at it now. What has become of it? What has the bureaucracy done to improve the lives of the most important people – the youth?” This question seemed to unsettle the elders. One spoke in direct response “This college was designed for one purpose, with two blue-suits repositioning in response. The tension in the atmosphere was rising, I could feel it.

“In your what?” yelled the man. “Your twisted, and I saw one bow his head in what could only have been shame. “It's a police state, nothing less.” said the man. A few cries of agreement could be heard.

The elder who had spoken was scowling, lads, and all collegiates.” Our attention was undivided, with every ounce of focus directed towards the speaker. “I brought you all here not just to frolic and to relax. Beer and friends are here, yes, but that is not the driving intention behind this gathering.” Brief murmurs of discussion swept through the crowd. “I brought you here to remind you of what it feels like.” He paused for a moment, then continued “What it feels like... to be free.” By this time, my conscious mind an overwhelmed trench of emotionally charged memories. Memories of freedom

“Do not weep, we were sure. It was time.

I screamed to the absolute limit of my vocal muscles, to take back the college that was rightfully ours. Boredom and resentment vanished in the place of excitement and friendship, and the party that night marked an epiphany in university life.


The blue-suits were awakened by the speech of the elusive roof man. They arrested all elders and old ones in the college town for unjust treatment of youth and countless robberies of grog. New, the institution had transformed.

The only trace the man left of his identity was a brim-filled keg of premium draft beer, I thought, in both content and ambiguity.

It's a sad thing to admit, that you have spent so much of your time on autopilot without considering or acknowledging it, that when the end inevitably comes, you will regret each of those moments not fully cherished.

My memory has faded somewhat, it ought to be said that I am entirely to blame for my own downfall. I have lived my life in ignorance and reinforced it with arrogance and stubbornness, if I could take it back- if I could take everything back- I would. I would plead with my friends to forgive, I would beg my lovers not to leave me and I would have been there for my family, because they were always there for me.

Alas, hoping that somehow it will make a difference.

One of the great ironies of life- at least in mind- is that humanity strives for happiness, men and women, all of them strive for more. All of them are miserable, and all of them end up in the same place once they are dead.

The end is coming soon. I can feel it, but the truth is, even if there was someone here to tell me as much, I wouldn't believe them. We don't know what happens when we die, some of us claim to know, but nothing can be proven, nothing is certain, and reincarnation is just as likely as nothing at all. Either way

I suppose I should finish writing and close my eyes for a while, or maybe it is the illness, either way, it is useless resisting. 

Before I go however, to everyone and anyone I ever pushed away or hurt, I am sorry, from the bottom of my heart. I lived my life as a spiteful human being, and I cannot ever forgive myself, but I loved you, I loved all of you, because you gave my life purpose

So it would seem that is it. I needed to say sorry and thank you. I can't forget my manners. I simply wish my final thoughts to be that of thankfulness. I will be thankful to join those I have lost, and for that too, I am thankful.

This will be the last memoir I write. The last words I put on paper. I suppose there should be some kind of conclusion or catharsis, there is only word left to say, and that word is:

Sometimes daydreams to be released from this captor play out in my mind, wanting for some kind of way to change the predicament for the best, with as little consequence as possible. These thoughts and schemes are a constant plague on my reality.

More time passes. We learn more about you, but we are well aware of your intentions. We know what you have in store for us, more so what you have in store for my wife. It scares her tremendously, but she carries on. Strong enough to withstand what pain you put her through. Again I wish for some way to help her through this, to stand in and take some of that pain for her. But I am not your target, she is.

Your demands are starting to take their toll. I try and contemplate what help I could get, we would stop anyone trying to intervene. Yes, we are both so attached to you, o captor, we would fight tooth and nail for your safety, despite what pain you cause.

The day comes that one of your attacks is too much. She is in so much pain. Bodily fluids have been spilt. She needs medical attention. As we all proceed to the hospital, but she if finally calm and stable. Things are quiet, and she is sleeping.

There is a man in a yellow jumpsuit standing in the snow outside my basement peephole.

I see his filthy boot and gun-barrel. I'm silent as I peer out the four-inch cavity exposed after  I removed the aluminum duct and insulation for my dryer vent. I hear him taking a piss

His comrades, the new language of the World Government.

Albert’s wife and chubby teenage son are huddled together in the snow under a Nascar sleeping bag. Albert is being prompted at gunpoint to lay his collection of guns down on his driveway. The Tenders have one of those creepy metallic Dog-Bastards for troop support - it's the size of a Ford Fiesta - AWG's latest model - a mechanized kill-machine. The Dog-Bastard has poised itself between Albert’s family and the doorway of their house

Albert is pissed off. He’s going on and on about the Second Amendment and rations and the AWG and poisoned food. He's eye-popped and shirtless. The giant bald eagle tattooed on his heaving beer-belly looks as if it's going to launch off his jiggling gut at the jumpsuits. Albert spits toward the jumpsuits and storms back into his house for another armload of guns. He kicks open his screen door

The Tender outside my peephole sprints across my yard

The dome on the Dog-Bastard’s head flashes from passive blue to stop-light red

Albert snaps his right hand out from the poncho. He produces a sawed-off and drives the barrel into the head of the nearest jumpsuit, spreading blood and gristle across the plexi-glass like a bug-smeared windshield.

The sprinting Tender fires a haphazard rifle-shot - blood spurts from the eagle's head tattooed on Albert's belly. The impact drives the fat man backward into the snowbank like a star-spangled garbage sack..

The Dog-Bastard leaps forward and straddles Albert’s body. A twisting piston is thrust from its rib-cage, it pulls back pieces of my neighbor.

January 17

I am hiding this handwritten testimony in a plastic sandwich container

My hard drives were wiped clean by an electromagnetic pulse six days ago

The Tenders took Abby - I took that the worst - my dog. They found her whimpering under the stairs when their Spiders scanned my basement. I nearly bit a hole in my cheek stifling my rage

After the outbreak of the Sceptre-A virus, I received the flu shot after we were warned about the spreading epidemic. Holdouts who refuse the shot are being hunted down, sent to camps and processed.

The vaccination is taking charge of my will. I feel larvae in my mucus - a pulsing virus in my blood - tapeworms under my eyelids - re-assembling. I feel their intelligence. My body has become a hive.

January 18

Three holdouts on snowmobiles are trying to open the fire hydrant across the street. A flannel-clad man is twisting on the spigot with a huge wrench while his companions keep watch for Tenders

Szee-szip-szee-szip-szee-szip sounds come from the north

The holdouts haul-ass to their idling snowmobiles. The Spiders spring from the pavement. The shrill sszzzzzeeeeee blasting from the Spiders is in a frequency that shatters the icicles hanging from my roof. Two of the holdouts make it to their snowmobiles as the flannel-clad man takes a swing at the nearest Spider with his wrench. He is overtaken by two of the insects at his waist. The first Spider scrambles up his back, making him gag and croak, flailing in a mad aerobic exercise.

Abandoning their companion

It's dark now. I cannot see the flannel-clad man pinned in the snow

Headlights from an approaching vehicle reveal the flannel-clad man into my frame once again. I see the front end of a converted mail truck, blanketing him in a red aura. One of the Tenders karate-kicks the poor guy in the chest, snapping him backward - then forward, like a kid’s bouncy toy. The laughing Tenders return to the mail-truck and leave the scene.

I need water. I am running out of matches, glowing in the street.

Szeet-Clomp-Szeet-Clomp - approaching from the west. A Dog-Bastard with two Spiders march into view behind the flannel-clad man. He’s writhing in the snow like an insane living statue. This Dog-Bastard is the size of a Jersey cow with its skin and muscles removed - a silver-framed monster of perfection with rubber tendons. It stands behind the man and extends a long tubular siphon. It drives the translucent tube into the man's back. His croaking erupts into an agonized scream.

The Dog-Bastard sucks gore through the siphon into a deflated sac hanging from under its backbone

The man becomes a flannel-clad husk - his juices draining in chunks through the siphon into the Dog-Bastard’s expanding sac.

The metallic beast retracts its siphon

 A Spider tippy-toes past my peephole.


 I am so very quiet.

I drank the last of my water. I was going to scoop snow from outside the dryer vent hole with a measuring cup duct-taped to a broom handle

I felt a beetle scurry across my skull

I sliced the palm of my hand open on a piece of sharp copper breaking apart frozen water pipes. My hand hurts less than it should. My blood is thick - a pale pus oozing out. There are tiny silver dots that look like b.b’s in the blood. The little balls are skipping and popping on my bloody palm like water drops on a burning skillet.

I came back to the place where we began. This house is so full of memories of happiness

Memories are fickle companions, altering, changing into something that is not you at all, but a depiction of what I believed you to be instead of what you are.

I do not want my memory of you to fade

I abandoned everyone else. They will continue without me

Even if you are gone


Dear Julia

I became infected today. I gave in to the temptation

I know you would disapprove Julia; you had such an affinity for living, after all the things I have seen, all the horrors I have experienced, all the people I have lost; would you feel the same?

The infection process isn’t instantaneous; it takes several days for it to truly take you away. I wonder if part of you remains

I will be with you soon Julia.

   
Dear Julia

I awoke this morning, it tricks you into believing you are suffering from an illness that appears non-threatening, and then when you believe you are beginning to recover, that is when it attacks.

I live in constant fear of that attack

I’m almost glad you cannot see the world today, but it does not look like our home; not anymore. It is almost unbearable to stay between these walls, underneath this roof, where we once shared so much happiness, knowing the things I know now. It breaks my heart to see this perfect haven become a part of the imperfect world I have been drifting through the past year. It won’t be much longer now. I won’t last much longer now.


Dear Julia

The trees outside our house are bare. It isn’t winter. There are simply no leaves that wish to grow. The walls are cracked and worn

The illness seems to be subsiding. I feel more agile and less lethargic. I know what this means though


Dear Julia

Is this what you went through? Is this how you felt? I hope you didn’t feel this pain

My skin… it aches Julia, how could anyone endure this? I am writing this letter with the greatest effort, in some vain hope that someone will read this, and one day put us both out of our eternal misery.

Oh god… My eyes, and an utter lack of vision.

I don’t know how long this will last before I am gone


Dear Julia

The end is upon me. We will be together again before long.
This feeling is abhorrent, and it feels almost as though sludge is being pumped through my system. I have been suffering from bouts of stomach cramps that leave me quivering on the floor. I haven’t eaten for several days; then again, I don’t have much of an appetite.

My vision only grew worse, if only temporary. I barely felt any pain during the process, but afterwards, after the blood and mush that was left of my eye was in the palm of my hands, that was when the agony set in. The blood that oozed from my eye socket was nothing like human blood. It was so dark it was almost black, and as thick as custard.

I can taste blood on my tongue. Blood and bile. The empty space where my eye once was only aches now, undiluted form.

  
Dear Julia

The pain has become so natural to me now that I can scarcely feel it. That or the pain has merely subsided as the infection finally takes complete control of my body.

I came down to see you today, along with you.

Your dead eyes stared back at me, your grace.

Even though most of your flesh has abandoned your face, when I look at you, there is nothing but clarity and I feel assured that my decision to become just like you was the right one.

I will be leaving this world, and those parts being replaced with this repulsive infection. But I am thankful, because I will be like you.

We will be the same. We will be together again.

We will be the same.

We will be the same.

He treads water and clenches to his split and failing craft. He says


""And so I lay here on the splinters of my self spun boat. These planks I hewed  and wrapped in sinewy fibers. These oars I snapped from limbs and carved. The cracks were caulked by mine own  hand. And proving water tight I sailed. And now it's just hardly sinking in. 
So what of my final home? Where am I to set my weariness? It's been some years last I was blessed and sinned I have since. Not only under great duress but often. 


For instance, in the eye of it, in that one shaft of light amidst all of it, she ran with the capstan and called to all hands, we weather this squall I'll see once more my betrothed! 


She never saw me though. And I but briefly stood by there, my eyes so warm, my even clap to the fiddler's foot, it all tasked the viewer to match my own gaiety. 


And blending so, grasp right and left and deftly snatch some lustrous coins right from her cup. Tumbling back up and cradling my split head, no one thought me for a second to be a simple street thief, they so stricken in grief with my wail, pain excruciate! 


Not for the need was it did, for I drank like a fish myself! why had you bottled me up then I'd have been your greatest chum. So, no, no miscreant am I, for  I  never drew pleasure from my criminality. and never did  I consider my personal vices to be  the  essential stuff of my character. Why, I washed in the drink like some wash in the tub, that virtue I claim.


And in virtue I am poor, my aim is fine and when I set mine I hit it near every time. But my sights have long been set low, and by some force of inertia, or by that complacentness so apt to befall idealists like myself, I've settled low and never flown far. And in my shade all canopy bowered I've lurked so long I remember none else. Now when I dream, I dream of a cavern deep, one watered dark and pooled. 


Some irony then! Me, like a toy in the bath. But this pool interconnects all over the globe and so really never seperated, I can say my last gasp and wherever she might be sea gazing she need only crane one ear cupped and strain some little bit to hear my words thus:

Please pray for me Amanda

1375163306.0,1jbypy,The Funeral of Linus van Pelt,BrothersportInAComa,3,0,0,"""The Funeral of Linus van Pelt"" - by Mykel Montes


Charlie Brown parked his car next to a sidewalk about three blocks away from the church. He grabbed the satchel that was in the passenger seat, because he was about to see a number of faces he hadn’t seen in ages; and torn inside, because his brain was repeating the memory of the phone call he received the week before. What came from the other end of the phone line was a crying Sally, his sister, giving news about the suicide of her husband. Her husband Linus.

As Charlie Brown came up to the chapel doors, he said to himself, “Here goes nothing,” and opened the doors. It was like the Christmas pageant rehearsal all over again, except, no one was dancing, and people finally turned their attention to Charlie Brown.
He was first greeted by Lucy. She said to him, he said, as he saw over Lucy’s shoulder his sister sobbing over the open casket, and Schroeder playing the church’s organ. It gutted him even a little more seeing the absence of a happy canine dancing on top of the musical instrument.

“I should have been a better sister all those years. Why did I have to be such a blockhead? Why couldn’t I be more gentle and caring?”

“Lucy

“But Charlie Brown

“Don’t worry Lucy. That’s behind us.”

“Sally and I tried our hardest to put together the best funeral and burial we could. Unfortunately

“Oh Lucy

Charlie Brown then greeted his sister. He held her in his arms.

“I’m a terrible wife. I should have given him his space. He should have been free to have experienced other women

“Sally

“Well

“See? It was nothing you did. But I should have been there for him all these years.”

“No

“No

“Oh what a shame. You know I always knew that woman was terrible for you. You should have at least tried to nab a date with Heather.”

“That was just a schoolboy crush. She was always out of my league. And then when she dropped out of high school

Suddenly, is your wife making you hold her purse for her while she has another period? Or are you finally queer like me?”

Charlie Brown turned around and saw Peppermint Patty standing,” said Marcy.

“Good grief

“YOU show some respect

“Why all the hate

“What do you think, it’s a mystery that you weren’t the one that ended up committing suicide, ya know that? You’re the reason I hate men. Thank god I eventually realized that my true love was always right beside me,” Peppermint Patty said as she put her arm around Marcy.


“Well then why are you being such a pissy bitch if you found love? Didn’t you hear that California finally legalized same-sex marriage?”

“WE DON’T EVEN LIVE IN CALIFORNIA

He woke up

“Are you okay?” the face said.

“It’s the little red head girl!” he exclaimed.

“Excuse me?”

“I mean -- I’m sorry -- Heather. It’s good to see you. What happened to Peppermint Patty?” Charlie Brown asked as Heather and Sally pulled him up by his hands. Sally walked and sat down to give her brother and Heather space to talk.

“She was escorted out, because she said that she and Marcy had some protest to attend or something.”

Charlie Brown and Heather conversed for about fifteen minutes. They told each other of their lives and what they had done since high school. Charlie Brown had always been afraid of talking to her in elementary school because of his attraction to her, Heather had become pregnant, which put pressure on her boyfriend. Her boyfriend had been jailed because of a drunken rage that resulted in her miscarriage. She was alone now, living in an old apartment building in Chicago. Coincidentally, Chicago’s where Charlie Brown had been spending his adulthood.

“In all honesty

“I’m sorry, and that my existence was nothing but a nuisance to others.”

“How do you feel about yourself now?”

“I feel… I feel good about myself. And I have to thank Linus. He was always encouraging me to have faith in myself and in the world. I wouldn’t be where I am now if it weren’t for all the advice he had been giving me since we were kids. He even gave me advice on how to approach you

“Beauty?”

“Yes. It was my weakness. My weakness was you. But I’ve overcome that fear

Heather stood quiet

“Charlie Brown, and then brought us together to have this conversation right here in this chapel. I doubt that you’re dumb enough to miss the new opportunity that the universe has at last thrown at you.”

Charlie Brown then smiled. Heather smiled back. They sat down on a bench next to Lucy and Sally as Reverend Franklin gave his sermon. After the sermon

“Linus was a gift to us all. I remember the horrific time in my life when I became addicted to crystal meth. Everybody from my childhood grew up, perhaps my voice would also sound like some broken trombone. But Linus helped me overcome my fears, and convinced me to get help, and soon enough I was on my way to recovery. Today, I stand before you, clean and pure like Linus’ childhood innocence. We all remember how excited he would get on holidays. We all remember his crazy stories about the Great Pumpkin and the Easter Bunny.  And I know we all remember that time he told us all the meaning of Christmas, and then got us all to sing around that small tree. It was Linus who reminded us that all things in life including that tree deserve love. It was Linus to reminded us to have faith.”

At this point in the speech

Pig Pen Continued:

“It is sad to see Linus gone from our lives, but it was his wish for all of us to have faith in love. Happiness is love.”

After the speech

Charlie Brown stepped up to the coffin and took one last look at his childhood best friend. Linus lay there with his arms crossed on his chest. His face hadn’t changed a bit since Charlie Brown last saw him.  Charlie Brown shared his final words with Linus:

“Hey buddy. It’s been a long time. You know, throughout my life, I never actually did discover the meaning of life, or the purpose of my existence. But instead, I discovered how precious all living things are, and how important it is to take chances. I would have never gotten where I am if I hadn’t taken chances, and I would have never seen how gorgeous the world can be hadn’t you been by best friend. I should have never left your side—“ He choked a little as he tried not to cry as he spoke. “What I discovered was how amazing life can be once you allow yourself to live it.”

Charlie Brown opened the satchel he had been carrying over his shoulder. He pulled out a small

“I love you buddy. I hope you and Snoopy are having a great a time together

No response for a minute

“He can’t be left alone.”

“What do you mean? “

I thought and thought … and I really felt bad 

for the guy. But after nine years of being

that every possible remedy must have been

of veterinarians

the longer I listened to his tale of woe. While he

For the first time the man’s face changed from a

Days went by and there was no sign of Alfie and

1374820060.0,1j2ztc,Charta Numus (Paper Coin),asdf123x,5,2,0,"Alex was born.

By the time he was 18 months old, Alex Miner was a genius. He began studying mathematics after a particular day playing with blocks and learning Latin. He simultaneously learned the word *scientia* and, while stacking red blocks upon yellow blocks, realized that ideas could be stacked too. From that moment on, he began to consume math day and night, stopping only occasionally to eat and, when mulling over a particularly complex problem

In his small room in rural Nebraska, he invented. He was prone to wild fits of anger, dowsed by deep crevesas of depression and meloncoly. He won awards for his discoveries, as well as money. He won three million dollars alone for Millennium Prize problems, by solving the Riemann hypothesis, the Poincaré conjecture and the Hodge conjecture within a single year. There were even rumors of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences approaching the Nobel Foundation regarding a Nobel Prize in mathematics for his work. Without care for fame or fortune, or any of those things the child mind does not bother itself with, and anyone who knows rabbit holes knows there is not enough room to turn or look back.

Of all the interests this life has to offer, the latter Byzantine coins of Alexius IV and Constantine XI, and old English hammered coins all struck him with great beauty and mystery.

When Alex was nine, but it was generally considered a hard problem by the mathematics community. This was the first time he had come to a puzzle in which he could not instantly solve, let alone solve at all. Day after day he lay at the foot of his parents bed, eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, daydreaming of numbers.

	
When Alex was ten, ever since his work in the field of quantum physics got the attention of academia, Alex was obliged to let doctors and specialists take photos of his miraculous brain. Top neuroscientists and cognitive researchers would fly into Lincoln Airport to meet with him, always leaving with a look of excitement on their faces as they went to begin their study of his head. At first it was just a small black smudge on the xrays, but the tumor grew and multiplied rapidly. More tumors grew over the course of a few months, and as his eleventh birthday grew near, Alex’s frontal lobe was irreversibly full of black smudges on grainy white photo paper.

His physical brain was of no concern to him though. As long as his mind worked long enough to solve this problem, Alex researched old coins and talked about collecting on a website he found called The New Mismatists. He let his concerns and thoughts slip away while he lost himself in Greek and Roman provincial coins, talking to other collectors and amateurs about this nuance or that. He started his own site shortly after and called it Charta Numus.

While Alex’s website thrived with coin collectors and enthusiasts

“I need to go into space.” He said one morning at the breakfast table.

“Why do you need to go into space dear?” Asked his mother.

“I’ve come to the end of my research

“Space is quite a long ways away

“I’ve already decided

His father spoke up, it takes a lot of training to get ready for something like that. Besides, it is very expensive, I think it costs more money than you have.”

“I have a plan

Alex worked furiously. He sent emails to scientists, he was ready.

“I’m going into space tomorrow.” Alex said to his parents at the dinner table.

The looked at each other incredulously. “Honey

“Yes, both Bromley’s camp and Drell’s camp have come around on the specific plausibilities. There is virtually no substantial counter-arguments left. I...” He stopped. 

“Mom, but I want to do this more than anything I've ever wanted. I have a list of doctors here you can ask anything, I can make the launch and return flight. Dad, no one has ever done this experiment before, and this is my last chance to, I have to go.” 

His mom cried, thinking about earth.

The launch was more terrifying than people had told him it would be. There was a beauty in the terror though

“Yeah

I am Professor Delphinius S. Tucker, I was the sole professor of Religious studies and history, but I doubt they have kept my position for me. I was taught at Cambridge and raised a citizen of Her Majesty Queen Victoria's Empire. When I was born, the world was nothing as it is today. As it was, technology was at a low point, the steam engine was being redesigned to hold more power, and exert more force. It was a sad time in human history, and technological development was almost at a stand still with the world focused on production of a better steam engine. On the year of my fourteenth birthday my father went off to war. It was with the news of his death that I devoted my life to creating technology for the whole world.

By the time I was 18 my life was one of luxury and enjoyment. I had finished my underschooling in the metropolis of London, and the other sciences, my mind took a different focus for my upperschooling: Religion, philosophy and history. Something had always interested me in the past, and I was intrigued when studying Da Vinci that I decided to learn of what marvels and technologies had been hidden out of human eye for many years. It was during these years that I brought forth my most famous inventions. I invented underwater ships so massive that scores of men could live for years underneath the sea to study the marvels of the depths. I invented ships of similar design that could even exist outside the atmosphere of the earth, studying the stars in the very sky above our heads. With each invention my aspirations grew and grew. It was only a matter of time before I began to undertake the invention that would bring me to the place I am now: The Transdimensional Ætherportal.

However, you learn a lot about many languages other than English. I am still thankful for that, as those studies have made it easier to communicate with the strange species I have come to meet. Alas, I am getting sidetracked. I was only 22 at the time I ended my schooling, and I was not quite ready to risk the world to see other dimensions. I had finished my Transdimensional Ætherportal only a year earlier and still was running stability tests on the portal itself. I began to look for one who would become my bride. It was three months later that I found her, Abigail Williams. She and I fit together perfectly. For weeks I was madly in love with her. We had dinner and had gone to the theater on many occasions. We spent every waking moment together. Three months after the day we met, to the day

She accepted through teary eyes. A month later she went on holiday to visit her mother and prepare for our wedding day. It was a week after she left that I received a letter in the post. It was from the coroner in Pensburry. My dearest Abigail had been killed by an unknown man. There had been no witnesses and the Constibul was attempting to do everything he could to find the killer. I knew enough at the time to realise there would be no hope in finding the killer. It was then that I gathered my things and made passage across the Atlantic. I was going to start a new life in America. I booked an airship from London that would be sufficient to carry my belongings. The Royal Navy expressed it's disapproval of my leaving

As I watched London, I knew that my life was taking a turn for the better as I felt sure that I would be able to start an entirely new life where I was going. I began preparing my opening lecture for my new class. I had been guaranteed a spot as the Professor of Religious Studies and History at a small university called Wesleyan. I decided to open my Religious studies class with a lecture on the concept of God. I was going to open them up to the idea that different cultures had different Gods, and these belief contradictions were the cause of many conflicts over the ages. Little did I know that I would never get to deliver this lecture. It was then, on that airship, that I decided to run one final test on my Transdimensional Ætherportal.

I moved to the cargo area of the ship and removed the portal’s canvas cover. The large brass apparatus towered over me. The overall spherical shape at first had unnerved me during its creation, I realised what I had done. I had activated the portal.

I can't remember it quite clearly, the raw seething hatred, I knew where I was, but I would never wish to admit it. I believe that I had fallen into the depths of hell. I remember struggling against the pull of millions of blood covered and death ridden arms and limbs of unknown kind grasping onto me, as if their very being depended on it. I remember as I awoke I felt as if I was being yanked out of that horrid wasteland. I stood and rubbed my head. I looked around, I was still on the airship, but there was something different about it. The light had changed to being a white hue, to being a strange off white color. As if the properties of infrared light had somehow entered into my view. I could see my pilot looking around frantically through the thin skin of the aircraft. I could not

1374734824.0,1j0hpr,A Slightly-Different Morning,ThePraetor,3,0,0,"I woke up feeling surprisingly normal. There were none of the usual aches and pains that I felt sometimes

I leapt out of the bed, I saw the floor of the apartment above mine. My right leg was floating half in, half out of the brown-speckled tile, and I was further surprised to see it whole. I had lost it below the knee in combat ten years ago, but it was all there, despite the fact that I could feel none of it. I testily moved the limb, and it silently emerged from the floor. I was forced to stifle another shout of alarm when, I saw the occupant of the apartment. She was sleeping, and I sank down, however

I opened my eyes, I floated through the ceiling. The floor above was the lobby, and I came up just in front of the reception desk. I expected the people in the lobby to recoil at the sight of my scarred visage appearing from the floor, but no one seemed to notice me. This was starting to seem like a trend, so I began to walk towards the door. I found that, if I concentrated, I could prevent myself from falling through. I stepped right through the glass doors, my embarrassment won out and I decided to return to my room. I turned to face the building

I flew up much faster than I had earlier. My apartment was on the ninth floor, I was able to stand on the cracked concrete and look through my window. I walked through the screened glass door into my small kitchen. I went into my room via the wall, and noticed that I was lying on the bed. I looked surprisingly serene, but the fact remained that my dead body was lying less than ten feet in front of me, and I was standing there looking at it. I took the news that I was dead pretty well, considering the circumstances. Death had been around the corner for me since I joined the Service, and I was almost glad that I had gone while I was sleeping peacefully, perhaps, a black t-shirt, allowing me to see the floor through the fabric. I walked over to my nightstand and pocketed my phone

I came out on the roof, but I didn’t feel it like I normally would. The air passed through me, leaving behind only the soft feeling of a light breeze. The smog, normally the most dominant smell in the air, was even worse than average. I decided to get away from it, and jumped again. The roof of the building receded in a flash, and I was above the clouds. I threw my arms apart, and could see the entire city. The cars on the 101 were like ants, landing

I shot downward, I let go of the suitcase, and sat on the floor of the plane. Despite the air moving past at 500 miles per hour just inches from my rear end, I felt nothing. Despite my long career in the field of clandestine operations, I had somehow never found myself in the cargo compartment of any passenger jet, much less a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737. I figured that, seeing as I was dead, concentrated on not falling through the plane,,

and here's the second story

This adventure takes place, so we’ll start there.

“Give me the keys!” shouted Bean-Man.

“No! You’re just going to go home!” Gerbil Lady shouted back.

“I will not

“You are naked!” Revealed Gerbil Lady.

“That’s beside the point!” Bean-Man sighed. “Just give me the keys

“You promise?”

“I promise.” Bean-Man promised.

“You promise we’ll search for rainbows? And

“No. I’m going home.” Bean-Man replied as he swiped the keys out of Gerbil Lady’s hands.

“Please.” Thomas said with an indignant smile. “I would think such comparisons are a touch naive. I am not pure evil, like you and every other sane person on this planet, am a combination of good of evil; a moral cocktail, made of a mixture of ideals, beliefs, thoughts, both moral and immoral. I simply choose to embrace the side of myself, fearing the consequences of tipping their ‘moral compasses’ too far into the red.”

They will rally together, endure economic rationing, and then that technology is adapted and used in other walks of life.”

“We do not need war to innovate and develop. Look at the last 100 years, how much the world has changed with the advent of molecular transference. Not to mention finally sequencing the human genome, and all the possibilities coming from that. Is this not proof enough of our ability to push without conflict?”

“Medicine has stalled. You know that as well as I do. We have reached as far as we can with what we have. We need something new. And I wouldn’t count finishing a project started during the cold war as a victory for non conflict inspired thought.

    It's hard to believe that there was ever a time when my life had been empty. Ever since birth my wall has been filling up and I've been followed by tons of people. I'm 16 now, they just don't understand. 
   Life is simple. It's basically a game. You fit in and develop a certain part of yourself to appeal to others. The more appealing, but I can never find the time to talk to them, nor do I try to. They are mostly consisted of my friends and then the occasional random person. But it's ok, I'm never alone. They're always just a few steps behind me wherever I go. 
   With the Followed there is also the Unfollowed. Johnny McGuire is one of these unpopular scums of society. He's a poker
   School. A bombardment of educational videos. I swear half the stuff they are telling us isn't even true. There was a time when there were no followers? Pssh yeah right. These people probably think we're stupid. They try to tell us ""You're spelling it wrong"" or ""That doesn't even make sense."" I think they are wrong. Why should we make things harder on ourselves. Life is supposed to be easy right?
   Everyday I come home, strangers, aquaintences, well really they're all my friends, have all left messages for me. I sort through it finding the blaring red ads and viruses and erasing those. Can't have those in my timeline, don't want an impure record of my life. I also have to keep my wall clean for the stalkers. These mega-users are looked up to throughout the world. They have millions of friends and it's their job to sort through everyone's walls, feeds, they are not the highest ranking citizens in the world. Above them are the likers. These elite beings act as moderators and judges for our lives. The take into account all the different aspects of life
   I guess I should be honest though. I make about three new friends a day and add a follower every two days or so. I'm decent
   I go to sleep, wake up, school. Go to sleep, wake up, school. It's life. What else is there. I'm happy, aren't I?
    I wake up one morning. I'm sitting in my room, and I feel different. I open my door and step through. A bombardment of senses hits me and I feel like I never have before. I SMELL then scents in the air, so intricate and airy . I HEAR the noises, a bird, a stream, the wind. I TASTE the sweet taste of springtime it seems for the first time. I FEEL the sun beating down on my skin and the grass underneath my feet as I tread towards a group of people. I SEE things. I've seen pictures posted on walls, but this, but this, I was alone. I was connected to people, and I can see in their eyes that they have SEEN for longer than I. A man steps out
1373950113.0,1ie5t1,Saturday night,Ttea,3,0,6,"The clearest thing about that night was the slight laugh lines that formed at the corners of his eyes and lingered by his lips. I wanted to trace them

I spotted him midway through the show. The band had a Rockabilly vibe and he was the only other person moving to the beat in the tiny space. It was, but I could tell he loved the music. We smiled at each other and quickly looked away, but our feet kept leading us closer together. Finally, there was only a rough looking Biker between us, covered in piercings. I took a deep breath, placed my hands on the leather-clad gentleman's shoulders, and whispered tantalizingly in his right ear...""Sweetheart, but you're the only thing between me and the man who's dancing. I'm going to move you over a bit."" 

And I did just that, sweat dripping and beer chugging; singing about heartbreak and sex and beautiful women. We danced, bumped into people, made room for ourselves--we twisted and stomped and cheered until our voices were raw and feet sore. ""Can I buy you a drink?"" he asked with an accent, during a brief pause from the band. ""Well, I..."" I looked up at his face, at his smile, maybe? 

He returned a minute later, back to the rhythm. We danced in tandem but we didn't touch, not even once.

At the end of the show the singer threw his arms around me. ""I'm sorry, and he released me with the biggest grin on his face. ""You boys were fantastic tonight. I'm so glad I came."" I hugged the bass player and said my goodnights, while the band had another beer. 

Outside, only to be disappointed. In the end I just kinda blurted it out--""I am in a bit of a different relationship situation. I am married, but we see other people...I don't do one night stands, though."" He shrugged. ""Eh, I'm not sure how to pick up girls, anyway."" He was an engineer, though what he really wanted was to be a helicopter pilot. He was in town for work and only had one night to live it up. ""I still want to dance! Do you know any nightclubs?"" 

I took him to the gay bar. It was the nearest place I could think of with a dance floor still going. ""You don't mind

""So, do you think you could be my wing woman?"" I laughed. ""Of course.""

At the club, I broke my arm here once."" He raised an eyebrow and the corners of his eyes crinkled as he grinned, taunting me a little. ""Well, you should get back on the horse then, yeah?"" ""Yeah, perhaps.""

I jumped up, not daring to look at him. When I came back down he whispered to me ""Well, you've got some moves."" We had another drink and he looked over the crowd. ""I feel bad about chatting someone else up; I'm here with you!"" ""Go, silly, I brought you here to have a good time. Do what you want to do.""

""Well

""...Okay

When our feet would no longer hold us and I was sure my lungs would burst, is it?"" I paused. ""I...I don't really know!"" ""Well it's your rules, silly, what do you mean you don't know?"" 

His kisses were gentle and warm. I pulled back, we moved in close, and I slid my arm around his neck briefly. We moved together--slightly apart, but I could feel the warmth of his chest. Then the song was over, and we pulled away. 

Outside, however, we realized that our only option that late was ordering from the 24 hour pizza place. ""We could order to my room...?"" He was so hopeful. ""Not happening, my dear."" ""Well, you can't fault me for trying,"" he said sheepishly. I couldn't. I probably would have enjoyed the one night with him, but it really wasn't my thing. I called him a cab and said I could walk home from there, though?""

""Probably!""

The walk took me a half hour. I met others on the way, and he replied in kind. The next morning we each texted once to say thanks for the company and we had had a good time. He was the last to text and I left it at that, smiling.

Two days later

“Where am I?” I thought. “Am I dead?”

I sat up and looked around. I felt strangely light headed but not in an uncomfortable way. It felt like I was flying.
When my eyes adjusted to the brightness I saw a figure approaching me. I felt no fear but more of rejoice

I stood up, brown and black, I couldn't figure out the colour.
As he came closer he started to speak. I had never heard the language but I somehow recognized it. To my amazement I could understand it. He was speaking towards me

When the man was close enough I stood up. At that moment he was within five meters of me. I asked him “Where are we?” And he answered “We are where you want us to be. We can be anywhere.” I looked around for the second time and my heart nearly skipped a beat; we were in my childhood home
The man sat down and so did I. 

After a short while I asked him “Are you God?” 

“Yes.” He answered. 

“But if you are God then I must be dead.” 

“Must you?” He asked. “For you to be dead you had to be living at some point.” 

“Are you saying I don’t exist?”

“No. On the contrary; you are the only one that exists.”

“What are you saying?”

“I am saying that you are the only human being in the world.”

I did not quite understand what he was talking about and he must have realized that because he said. “You are the only man in the world and every other human is your imagination. What I am telling you now I have told you countless of times.”

I started to get very confused and felt a headache coming. “Just to get this straight; I am not dead because I was never alive

God signed and pointed to the door. “When you walk through that door you will be born again. You will know everything from all your past ‘lives’ but not remember anything from them.”

“What is the point in this?”

“The point is very simple; when you have lived through everything you will know everything and then you will become God.”

“So I will replace you?”

“Correct.”

“And the only thing I have to do is walk through that door?” I pointed at the door and felt a small shiver lead up my spine.

“Also correct.”

I stood up in haste and was going to walk to the door when God interrupted me. “But I must warn you; you are automatically walking to your doom.”

“I know, with a grin, and walked through the door.

“Smart kid” mumbled God “I wonder how long it will take him this time to figure out that he is my son.”

He had never truly created before. He'd done lots of making


It took lots of concentration, movement, color and character were threads forming a tapestry that covered him, changed him and the world around him was filtered through those threads. Each story that became part of his tapestry changed him a little more. Words that were not his filled his mind and sometimes escaping his mouth. 


The tapestry of stories that he carried with him seemed to be always growing. Others seemed to also carry their own tapestry


He worked constantly- refining his tapestry into a coat that would protect him and keep him warm. Instead of letting the words of the world come to him


He added to his coat of stories until had become long and heavy. He was quite proud of it and would use any opportunity he had to show it off (sometimes to the annoyance of others). But as proud as he was of his coat he began to find that it wasn't enough to just collect the pictures


He had always been fascinated by these magicians, with a few of their blessed threads bring damnation or salvation.


He wanted to be one of those magicians. He wanted to be adored for the threads he pulled from the air. He wanted to be blessed. But he was afraid. Ever so afraid. Because just as someone could bring damnation to others, and stories but these threads were made from the memories, secrets and lives of magicians. To hold the thread of a magician was to hold something that was precious to that magician. 


And above all else he feared judgment.


He feared that after all these years of hiding within the words


Then one day
He removed his coat and standing naked he reached within the deepest depths of his soul to see what lie there.
So deep did he reach that he forgot where he was


He awoke from his trance with this story in his hand. A story that seemed to have come from thin air. Filled with pride, shoddier version of the threads that made up his coat! He was filled with misery. So this was all he was capable of? After passing off the threads of his coat as his own he was now only capable producing terrible duplicates of the threads that he had loved and cherished. 


Horrified


What if, passed along and used for generations. Until one day someone created an imperfect version of that thread. It wasn't necessarily better- but it was capable of different magic that the first thread wasn't. Then what if someone duplicated that second thread, one that also imperfect? Then someone could have created a fourth thread by combining that second and third thread. What if this happened for millions of years? How many threads could there be? All of them coming from the same original idea but all of them still so very different. All of them making up the coat that covered him inside and out. 


Upon realizing this he reached within once more to pull out another thread. Sure enough, ugly thread in hand and on the ground next to him he realized that he was now a magician. 


He left his first thread where it lie, but the thought still terrified him. 


He stilled feared judgment above all else. 


He may have been a magician now




Then one day he could stand it no longer. He reached deep down a pulled a thread out of thin air. This thread held everything that was precious to him, they could hate it- they might even ignore it. But it didn't matter. Because he had decided that a magician who only creates magic for themselves serves no purpose but their own. And even the worse writer has more worth than one that hides their story away. 


Above all else he feared judgment. 

All else except never being heard at all.

I wonder if they knew they shared the common thread that was GWAR. The snuck in, once, while I was watching ""Empire Records."" Once, they managed to make an appearance.

Maria insists on ordering a pizza. I try to veto the idea, so I make a call, try to wrap up my online conversation on George’s phone and start searching for a playlist. Something I haven’t heard in a while. We sync my Youtube channel with the Xbox and it begins. It starts with melancholic melodies and sounds that drive us to introspection.

The last message we receive from the outside world…
“Turn off this phone.”

I keep texting. Katherine fills my thoughts. The screen begins to dance. It has only been fifteen minutes. I know these mushrooms are strong. Very strong.

I lay down in the bedroom for a minute and tell George and Maria that I’ll be out when the pizza guy gets there.

There is only one person I want to be with and the feeling builds. Laying in a dark bedroom

Kishi Bashi is playing on the Xbox. Manchester. Buzzsessions. A beautiful piece. George repeats the song over and over. Reverses to parts he likes over and over. I come out of the bedroom.

Maria is under the covers on the couch. Hiding

George looks up and smiles. ""I am writing the most amazing poetry."" His phone is in his hand

“George. You are on mushrooms. The outside world will never understand what you have to say

“Oh no.”

“What did you do?”

“I was writing on Carter’s wall.”

I can’t help but laugh. Kishi Bashi’s love song playing over and over again

“Dude. Bad move. Take care of that right now

He goes upstairs.

Maria speaks undiscernibly. I ask her how she is feeling and tell her when she is ready to stop hiding

“George. Get rid of that stuff. Go get some pillows and blankets and sit on the floor. Put it away.”

He goes upstairs, and starts to embrace the experience.

We smoke
The pizza guy shows up. He had been calling. Finally had to climb the fence to get to us. He complains at George. All George can do is smile and says

No tip. Oops.

The pizza guy huffs off. I ignore it, Maria is no longer hiding. She has been listening.

Their plan worked flawlessly. Maria starts to freak out. Crying hysterically. Too much noise for the middle of the night. George reacts to her anxiety. He is anything but calm. I give George things to do to distract him. I try different strategies on Maria. Different culture

Better

George freaks out about the noise. I tell him to retrieve the Xanax. Maria enters back into a crying fit. Mumbling about how sad she is and she can’t understand why her ex left her. Hysterical again.

At one point, it turns out, blind without her contacts or her glasses. Now she sees patterns and colors like she has never seen. She is into it, but the introspection kicks in and she begins crying hysterically, again. She switches back and forth between hysterical laughter and hysterical crying like no one I have ever seen. It is practiced. This is how she gets her way. Occasionally, when George is distracted she gets calm and asks, “Who are you?”

All I can say is

She gets too comfortable

I switch to doctor mode.

“Maria. Listen to me. In my hand is a pill. It is called Xanax

“Yes.”

“Good. I would very much like for you to take this pill. More than that

“Yes.”

I hand her the pill. She spills water all over the place trying to drink

I also have to explain that water is “quiet water” and that you have to be quiet when you drink it

Maria starts freaking out

“Don’t worry, then she will get quiet and then she will start over with the crying. The loop will repeat and diminish every time as the Xanax starts to kick in.”
George is fascinated when my predictions come true.

At one point

She goes into spoiled brat mode on mushrooms. It is grating when we were sober

""No more

""Maria. One of us is going to take this pill. It will help you sleep.""

""No more drugs.""

She is fighting the first Xanax hard. I eat the second one.

Finally

George is finally able to enjoy his trip. We become water brothers. Take the opportunity to go outside and explore. Smoke cigarettes. George has many important epiphanies about life. About his behavior. About the behavior of others. He marvels at how well I handle a hysterical Maria. Wonders why she had such a bad reaction to him all week long. When he is sitting on the couch

“Danny

“George

We both know the answer. GWAR taught George all kinds of answers.

1371762153.0,1gr3i0,Train Ride,SequiturNon,3,0,0,"Can a stranger make a difference in your life? I was wondering as I was looking at the only other passenger sitting two rows down from me. He was sitting in one of those rows with a table between them, he was the spitting image of the kind of stereotype you might imagine when you hear 'elderly gentleman'. Was that a bowler hat on the seat next to him? Damn.

Although this guy did have that sort of friendly vibe going for him. Old people seem to swing to one of two extremes: those defeated by the struggles of their lives, or the slight curving of his mouth and dimples that hinted at a face that liked to smile.

Suddenly he put the paper down. He cocked his head slightly as he met my gaze. Then he winked, I-I didn't mean to stare”, I stuttered.

It was fairly loud in the train, which, I was sure, was still beet red. Thankfully the lights inside the train were not lit, either. Truthfully, there wasn't much point anyway. The sun was just dancing through a cloudless sky – it was one of those perfect summer days you hear about, that, turns out to be way too hot. Was the tunnel already ending? Ugh

Alright, yer making it very awkward fer the two of us. C'mere, have a sit down.” He was gesturing emphatically, smiling at me. I couldn't help but grin at his genuine manner. “Jes dinnae sit on ma hat.”

Well

“I'm sorry about earlier

“Don' worry lass. Like I said

I smiled at him. “What brings anyone into a Train? I'm going to visit some relatives that I haven't seen in a while. They insisted that I come by.”

His bushy eyebrows drew down in mock sorrow. “Och, but he continued, pointing out the window. “Look, look! Nary a cloud in sigh'.”

“Well then

“See, “now, I go where I please.”

“Well, he stood  up, awkwardly wedged between the table and the seat. Bending down, he slowly planted a kiss on my hand. A sudden lurch of the train caused him to lose his balance and sit back down with a grunt.

“Och, continuing as if nothing happened. “It's a pleasure to make yer acquaintance. I am Earl Buchanan.”

There was something in the way he inflected “Earl”. I cocked my head and looked at him questioningly. “So... you're royalty?”

He returned my gaze very seriously. The reflection on his spectacles mirrored the trees that were passing by outside. Not even the breeze dared ruffle his hair. He frowned slightly, in an anticlimactic baritone, said “No.”

I was somewhat taken aback, and I concluded that it must simply be his strange sense of humor. “No, me name is Earl. I'm nae royalty but.. I can see how you would think that.”

At least

He told about growing up in the Scottish Highlands, and how he left his home in search of opportunities overseas with the economic upswing following the second World War.

“I missed me father terribly. Bu', running two wrinkly fingers over his mustache. “And,” he continued with enthusiasm, “what tales would I have shared with you on this train then? Bovine ma'ing season?”

He spoke about finding employment in a small bakery in North Carolina, taking jobs of opportunity while he traveled through the United States. “You see, I kinnae sit still. I was always lookin' fer somethin' that I gave up when I left home.”

He told me about making his way to Washington, saying “I take pride in me work. Jes don' ask me where I learned it.”

He spent the next few decades expanding his brand,” he said, “I am now a rich man. I've reached the goal I set fer meself all those years ago.”

“So, and the bones of me father are callin' to me.” His expression turned sombre, and for a moment I could feel a hint of the longing this man must experience. It tore at my heart. “And, you know,” he continued, his usual smiling self, “they dinnae understand me here enyway”.

“And you, jabbing his finger in my direction, “You should consider spending yer summer at home. Summer is a long time to be away from yer fam'ly. And,” he leaned forward, “take it from me... relatives are a poor excuse.”

He smiled at me once more. But this time there was an urgency in his eyes that hadn't been there before. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it... at that moment


I opened my eyes. Or, but a sharp stabbing in my chest drew that short. A gasp of pain escaped by dry throat.

I tried sitting up, that was painfully digging into the back of my head.

And then a shadow moved across my eyes. I flinched

I remembered. A flashback, ligaments tearing, bone breaking. I heard the screeching of tires and the acidic scraping of metal. I could see the horizon shift, and I knew my head was approaching the windshield again... I was bracing for the impact that I knew was inevitable.

 Next to the dresser is a rocking chair with an old man sitting in it. His frame is well built, but remain true to him. His face looks as though he just swallowed something very bitter, a grimace of sorts.
The door to the rest of the building slowly creaks open and The Lawyer walks in. The Lawyer is a skinny man, the most interesting accessory is his tortoise rimmed glasses, which frame his empty pale eyes. The Lawyer's face is devoid of any wrinkles, much like that of a baby, and if he wasn't fully grown it wouldn't surprise The Man if he started crying and asking for his mother's breast. When The Lawyer shuts the door quietly behind him the room takes on a cool eerie feeling, much as if it had transformed from a home to a cold, damp graveyard. The light from the window seems to bend towards The Lawyer
There is a moment of silence before The Man begins

The Man: It's not so bad

The Lawyer says nothing

The Man: At first I was worried

The Lawyer remains motionless

The Man: Not much of a talker

There is a silence for a while before The Man shifts uncomfortably in his seat. It is clear that The Man does want a conversation. The Man by turns takes glances at the dresser top and The Lawyer before continuing:

The Man: It really isn't so bad... It's Father's day, they were boys. It seems silly calling them that now, they could toss me over their shoulders if they chose to. (The Man laughs a little, not robustly like before, but knowingly. Confidently.) Yeah, they've grown up... I won't pretend I was the perfect father, in some ways I was the worst. I look at all these pictures and I noticed something

The Lawyer moves for the first time, almost as if he were a plastic replica of a real man.

The Man: Alright, is it? (The Man clears his throat awkwardly it is clear that he isn't used to talking about something so personal)
No. No one takes pictures of the bad times, it's easier to remember the hard stuff. There's some irony in that. And now here I sit, close to the end, and all I feel is regret. All the bad sticks out in my mind and the voices of the mistakes I made call out to me across the years, but then, I look at these pictures, and I remember the good stuff. Like, the picture is faded

That's my family, and all they wanted was to be their own men. I regret that I hadn't let them live their own lives I thought I knew what they wanted, but my desire for them overrode what I should have been doing: let them grow on their own. That's what I am doing now though, right? (The Man's eyes haven't left the picture, a pause) I lived my dream. Now they live theirs. I'm passing the torch. When I realize that, I know the only truth: I lived the dream. It's time for them to do it on their own. I think that, and I can only be happy. This is one of those times that a picture should be taken. So people can remember the happy time.

The Man's face curls into a smile, and nurses rush in to see if they can save The Man. They pay no attention to The Lawyer, almost as if he isn't there, going around him like a large rock in a river. The Lawyer gets up and looks more closely at the picture on the dresser. The four people are smiling, everyone is happy, like the best kind dream you could have. The corner of The Lawyer's mouth curled up into a whimsical smirk before he left to a room just down the hall.",,,,

Anna laughed and said as simply as she could ""Well, it's a shiny thing just like that one, which we sometimes use to pin to clothes"". ""ohh..."" said Suzy, and she got up to take a closer look. Her grandmother motioned to her to bring it closer, and Suzy sat in her lap once more, this time with brooch in hand.

""Where did you get it from gramma? Did grampa give it to you?"" asked Suzy. Anna laughed again, when I was very young. In fact, I think I was just about your age"". ""Wow... who was it?"" asked Suzy, filled with curiousity. Anna smiled gently at her granddaughter, and told her story just as she remembered it...

Anna was playing in the snow then, studying furiously as he had been for some time, and he was never any fun. So she had gone to her secret spot in the hilltop where she could see the whole town and where the air was fresher. There she observed the hustle and bustle as the people went about their day in the city below, and she drew circles in the snow. Ah... bliss.

Not long after she had begun to build a tiny snowman army, he smiled and winked at her. ""Ah, so my secret place isn't so secret after all, is it?"" he said. Anna frowned and said ""Nuh uh, this is my secret place! I came here first! It's mine, mister!"". ""Ah, you must be right! My mistake. Well, so would you mind sharing your special spot with me for awhile so I can catch my breath?"" said the man playfully. Anna inspected him from head to toe before finally saying ""Well... you look you're not a bad guy

He sat there in the snow watching the city, big monstrous creatures. Of course, they would still be no match for her army, because the bad guys always lose in the end. All of the stories her mother told her ended that way.

After he had sat there for a long time, pointing to the snowman army ""are the good guys and they will fight against"" then she pointed to the monsters she had made out of snow ""these baddies here. And they'll win of course!"". The man smiled, a little sadly. ""Do the good guys always win?"" he asked weakly. ""Yes! Of course they do!"" said Anna confidently. The man fell silent for a short while. Then he said ""I wish I had your conviction little one, but sometimes it feels as though no matter what I do, no matter how hard we fight, the bad guys won't give in"". ""Don't worry mister"" said Anna, ""as long as you're a good guy you have nothing to fear, and then nodded.

""You're right, when this war is over, things will be good again. We will have won against the bad guys, and things will be good"" he said. Anna jumped excitedly upon hearing this, and danced in the snow. ""You better win against the baddies mister!"" she said. the man simply nodded in response.

They heard footsteps walking up the hill, shaped like a flower and with a ruby in the middle and handed it to her. ""This I bought for someone else, but I think it is better left with you"". Anna stared at the shiny brooch, and beamed with excitement upon receiving something so beautiful. She hugged him in gratitude.

Then the soldier spoke ""Fuhrer

 

That was the first and last time she ever saw the man in person.

""Why do you keep it gramma?"" asked Suzy. ""Well..."" said Anna, and the purpose of the good guys was to make sure the bad guys were defeated at all costs.

And now is a time for sitting. For quietly taking in what's before her. A bed sheet, and her feet. I like this, she thinks, but the registration of her thought disturbs her silence, so she pushes them back down and merely looks. She looks upon them, on the hardwood floor of her studio, and silently expresses satisfaction for herself, and where she is at now. All quietly, she thinks. The thought is firm and it creates ripples across her studio. It is not a disturbance

And I like it. 

And, Doubt rose and looked her way. And doubt was far. Very far. But there is a certain quality of Doubt that allows it to travel with a speed not limited by distance or time. And Doubt is not an impatient thing, it is one that is content to wait, and linger, and haunt, like Lonliness. Together, they are powerful forces that do not need to be near to be known. So Doubt rose and looked out at her and she felt it. Even from that distance, she felt Doubt. 

It was not a good feeling, and bed sheets and felt satisfied. But there was more to do. She needed string to suspend the sheets. She needed to get up to tie the string to her window blinds and across the room to her kitchen cabinet doors. She needed to make those secure so that her bed sheets would be able to hang from them and create the tent that she had in her mind. And then she needed to light it. She needed to create the atmosphere that would make her tent living room perfect. She needed her retreat and she needed it to be perfect. 
And so

She laid down her blankets, from the window blinds to the open kitchen cabinets, securing them tightly at each end, making them perfect for the exact tent shape that she wanted. A small pride grew within her as she started to see her creation take shape. She viewed it as herself and as an observer watching herself create and then be within the space she saw she was creating, and a small seed of accomplishment sprouted within her alongside her pride. All it needed now were some books to hold the sides of the suspended sheets down to create the proper shape of a tent and then some lights to - 

and Lonliness comes again. A quick step closer than where it was before. It is pushed back by her will, there is only me. There is only my wants and my desires and that is all. There is nothing else. There is only what I want. Lights. I want light. 

And the lights she has in mind are perfect. Small electric diodes taped to the inner lids of mason jars. Simply made and, they look to be the glow of small fireflies. Magic in a jar. Magic in a living room. It's beautifully cinematic and it's perfect.

  hovers around the city looking for any trace of   survivors that might  be below. Down on what used   to be the peaceful city, death and gore fill the streets   turning the once pure black asphalt now to a deep   murky red. Over the pain filled screams of the living   and the mindless groans of the undead, Kenton and   Elizabeth hear a desperate shriek
 from the   helicopter
eyes and face light up with a hopeful glee. “We can   get out!” she exclaimed. “They’re here to save us.”

Kenton gazed around the corner of the hunting 
supplies shop they had been trying to gain access 
to. “There is an old grocery store about a block from 
here that they should be able to see us from.” 
Kenton said. “I don’t care what it is
get the hell out of here.” Elizabeth murmured. “We’re 
going to need guns if we are even going to stand a 
chance at getting over there.” Kenton exclaimed. So
Kenton pulled the last bobby pin out of his pocket 
and slowly slipped it into the lock on the door that 
opened the gun store they’d been hiding behind 
silently. Saying a prayer under his breath he ever so 
carefully and slowly maneuvered it until he heard 
the slight clicking sound. “Thank you” he whispered. 
He placed his sweaty palm around the knob and 
slowly turned it being careful not to make a sound.

heartless. But quickly dismissed the feeling and 
found where the ammunition had been stored and

putting the rest in a place where he could easily

executed with a bullet to the back of the head. 
Kenton could still vividly see the pool of blood and 
skull fragments that had quietly settled around the 
poor man in the back of his subconscious. He 
snapped out of the gruesome thought and placed 
the excess ammunition in his bag and decided there 
wasn’t anywhere else to hold another gun and 
began to gather up his newly stocked bag. 
 


          
As he and Elizabeth were exiting the shop
noticed a door that he somehow missed upon first 
arrival. On the other side of the door
slurping noise that almost sounded like a dehydrated dog attempting to drink from its bowl. He didn’t know why, it was too late. The undead man fell onto Kenton with his full weight, taking all the breath out of him. In a panicked set of motions he desperately reached for the .454 that was in its holster. But as he did, time seemed to freeze. He stared into its lifeless eyes that were now pure glossy white, no pupil or lens left, which terrified Kenton. But when he looked upon the mouth of the creature he felt a fear that he had never experienced before, a mind numbing fear that sent a cold shiver to his very core. The undead man was grinning at him. An evil, demonic grin that took the color out of his face… He then seemed to float out of his body and watch the events unfold. Like a dream. He watched as he pulled out the .454, brain matter



         
He snapped back into reality. He quickly jumped to his feet knowing the gunshot that still buzzed in his almost deafened ears would certainly alert more to their presence. He quickly grabbed Elizabeth and turned to run out the door. It was then he noticed the man who hung himself had reanimated, and put a little distance between themselves and the horde.

   
 
     
 But once they stepped inside they looked upon the store with horror. The undead were here. Hordes of them. They looked up from the piles of dead they were feasting on eyes fixed upon Kenton and Elizabeth. “Run!” screamed Kenton. They broke into a sprint with the undead not far behind running after them. Kenton managed to blow the heads off a couple with the .454 while firing into the horde behind them. They had finally reached the stairs and only one appeared on them. Kenton ran up next to it, her flawless complexion, her gorgeous face… Everything about her perfection he took in one last time. “I’m sorry my love I can’t go…” He said with tears rolling down his cheeks. Elizabeth only than noticed the deep bite mark that protruded his neck already making the skin around the wound decay. “NO!!!!” She screamed at the top of her lungs she was now bawling. She attempted to jump out to hug him but was stopped by the solider. “Please don’t cry my love. You are safe, that’s all that matters… I promised I’d keep you safe and I did. Be happy my love. I love you so much and I always will Elizabeth.” He took the wedding ring off his finger, and placed it in the palm of her hands and kissed her goodbye. 


         
 That’s when the door broke down and dozens of the undead poured out. “I love you” he cried as the helicopter lifted into the air and took off. He then turned and faced the now approaching undead horde. The 12 gauge in his hands and the M-16 dangling carelessly around his back. He opened fire into the horde blowing off limbs and sending groups of them spiraling backwards. Through the thick red mist created by their blood, he slowly lifted the gun to his temple, cocked the hammer back, whispered the words “I love you Elizabeth” one last time and gently pulled the trigger. The last thing that Elizabeth saw as the helicopter escaped the building that’s rooftop was now painted red was the faint red mist coming from Kenton’s skull and his body slowly falling into oblivion, than hitting the ground with a horrid thumping noise that would haunt her forever     ",,False,t5_2qhmi,True

While I was sitting outside the coffee shop across from the theater, however, and I decided to listen for a bit. 

The woman spoke to her boyfriend about her children, how she loved them so much, and how they were growing up so fast. The man laughed along and nodded in all the right places, and they seemed to be having a nice time together. 

Having heard enough of their conversation to satisfy my curiosity, cars filled the parking lot and the outer walls were immaculate white, red letters shining from above the crystal clear glass of the windows that lined the massive, shining glass doors. Now, looking at the theater, I notices streaks of gray stained down the tops of the walls and dull spots on the windows, dimmed lights where the theater’s name used to shine so brightly. 

Although it was a warm June day, catching the wind when they could and diving down to the ground before rising back into the sky. I watched them flying and felt happy that birds could be so happily excited by something that they were given by nature. In our own way, humans aren’t so different from the birds. Birds were naturally given flight, and humans were naturally given the tools to create. 

I saw a group of children playing on a horizontal column of basalt, and although there was so much fun being had around him, he looked bored as he sat watching on the bench carved from basalt across from them. 

I looked back at the chatting couple sitting near me and found them kissing. In the moment before I shifted my gaze back to the theater, my heart sank at this small detail. I had felt joy at watching a woman who was, to the extent of my knowledge, having an affair with this man. 

I glanced back to the theater, making its slow journey to opaqueness. The walls were spotted with brightness in places that were once covered by light fixtures that had long fallen off of it. My eyes slowly rose to the top of the building, where two metal spires reached into the sky, holding in place a great metal circle through which the spot of sun in the clouds shone. 

I realized at that moment that I was seeing the building exactly how its imaginer had intended it to be seen, flawed pieces. I was amazed to see how beautiful the building I had been looking at was, and how all of the flaws disappeared when you looked at it all together. 

Momentarily in awe
I caught a glimpse of the couple holding hands

When I looked over to the group of children

Then, dipping and rising in the wind. 

My ride pulled up in front of the theater and I began walking toward it. I then caught another glimpse of the theater, feeling like I had shared a secret with the person who had envisioned the theater.

She lived inside the fever dream that played in Kurt’s mind when he zoned out in the backseat of his mom’s SUV on rides across town. His eyes would always fix solely on the streets that scrolled past, repetitive day. He lived in a run-on sentence, punctuated only by the commas of sleep, and the uneasy anticipation for a period provided an anxiety that incubated in Kurt’s gut.

Any time that summer when Kurt sat down with nothing to occupy him she would materialize, until he craved more. He rebuilt her inflections, her pitch, lower and gruffer than the carbon copy schoolgirls, lacking the exaggerated Arkansan drawl that his classmates often hid behind. He conjured a story of both them in their 20s, until they were all tattoos and piercings. They smoked cigarettes next to a graffitied underpass by a faraway 7/11. They laughed about those suckers who shopped at supermarkets for family supper. She kissed him on a stained couch on the corner of some grimy Northern street, and because he didn’t know what a kiss felt like he imagined it

The SUV pulled up to his friend Zack’s house. Kurt got out and rang the doorbell. His mom waited outside until Zack opened the door. She yelled “Make good decisions!” to them and waved before driving away.

“Fucking bitch

“Apparently she thinks everyone she doesn’t know is a rapist.” 

Zack’s kitchen was littered with half-finished crossword puzzles and gunky dishes and flea market knick knacks. Zack’s dad Ed chain smoked by the window in his old rocking chair that was wrapped in a faded leather jacket with a stitched-on rebel flag. He looked 60 but seemed older when he started hacking. When he coughed it sounded like his lungs were filled with semi-liquified rusty nails

“That Kurt?” Ed said. 

“Yes sir

“Tell’m he ought to grow a pair

Kurt watched him smoke the filterless Marlboro. It was more of a suck than a smoke; he economically snatched as much nicotine as he could hold in a shallow breath. It took him seven inhales before the cigarette was gone. He jabbed it into one of the several ashtrays on the counter

Kurt and Zack walked down to the basement. In the room next to him there were two computers and a television set up on plastic buffet tables that seemed close to buckling from the weight. Automatically they both got on a computer. Zack commandeered the newer one because it was his house.

Zack’s older brother Rick lived in other basement room. He busted through the door. “What’s up boys?” he said.

“Not shit

“That little girlfriend of yours coming over today?” 

“In a little bit.”

“You finger her yet? I remember when I was your age and that was the fuckin’ threshold

“Not yet

Zack and Kurt idolized Rick. He was 22,’ or something. When Kurt came over Rick would hang out with them regularly, mimicking George’s salivating problem or joking about how fat Phil was. 

Before either of them started typing Kurt was already dreaming. Her name was Alex

“Did you hear me? Alex is coming over. We’re going to the River Rapids.”

“All right

Kurt sighed and slumped down into the scoliosis-induced hunchback posture he constantly tried to hide. He had become a part of a begrudging three-person dynamic that started a month earlier at River Rapids, he saw hoards of bikini-clad preteens standing on wet concrete, cackling at a girl in a one-piece. 

Kurt kept replaying the day. It was the first day after school let out, but couldn’t: she was just smiling and tussling his hair like she did in the treehouse. She was a rebel, she had small ears, she understood the things that Kurt felt cooking in his head but couldn’t explain, she lived outside of the world. 

Usually he stopped his head from replaying here

“You know that girl?” Kurt said.

“What girl?” Zack said.

“Alex

“Yeah

“I was thinking about asking her...”

Zack perked up. “Asking her what?

“Out

“You’re going to ask her out?” Zack was smirking. “You do that

“You think she’ll say yes?”

“Not sure

Kurt felt himself get closer to the picture in his head

“There’s your woman now, who was sitting at a table with two other girls. “Are you going to ask her or puss out?” 

Kurt stood up triumphant from the curb

“Ummm. What’s up?”

“Hey, red from laughter. The rest were staring intently at Kurt.

“You’re the one that sat down

“Oh

Alex’s eyebrows went up and she looked glanced at her friends. “Awww. You’re asking me out? You just asked me out. That’s so sweet of you. That’s really sweet. I’m sorry

Zack was rolling on the ground. 

“Oh,” Kurt said. 

Kurt wandered out of the entrance into the parking lot in a daze, getting into the car. “It was a joke.”

“It’s cool

Kurt knew that his fever dream had grown unhealthy. He had spent dozens of hours with Zack and Alex. He had almost completely separated himself from her

Kurt snapped out of it. Rick was clipping his toenails.

“How are you

“I’m all right. You?” Kurt said.

“Well

There was a long silence.

“Trying to do what?” Kurt said.

“That’s why I like you

“Is it working?”

“It’s real hard

“That’s true.”

Zack’s phone vibrated. “Alex is here. I’ll get this out of the way.”

Zack cracked his knuckles and walked up the stairs. Rick sat down at the computer. He and Kurt sat silent for a few minutes; it was a comfortable silence

“So how do you like Zack’s girl?” Rick finally said.

“I like her.”

“Yeah? Green haired little freak

“I guess.” Kurt took a deep breath. He needed to get the story out of his head again. “I asked her to go out with me. Zack didn’t tell me they were already were.”

“And he knew you were going to ask her?” Rick sighed. “Zack’s a fucker you know that

“Yeah

“You just need to stop being a little fruit. You know?”

“Not really.”

Zack opened the stairway door and snickered into the room. He was holding two fingers up. “I did it. I fingered her.”

Rick sighed. Kurt could feel his heart beat in his eyes again.

“Kurt

Rick kicked back his chair so that its corner punctured the thin drywall. He yanked Zack into the air by his collar, and threw him headfirst into the plastic buffet table. The table collapsed when Zack's skull bashed against it, and the old, bulky computer crunched Zack’s ribs. He started to wheeze.

“Fuck you

Rick was beat red

“Listen you fucking punk, to do something like that to your friend. I don't care if he might be a little bit queer, no one deserves that. You're sure as hell not my brother, because my brother would never do something as sick as what you just did. I can't even look at you.” 

Zack was crying and wheezing. “You broke my ribs

Rick put his head in his hands for a long take. He stared at Kurt for what seemed like a minute. Kurt stared back

Rick nodded back

“Please call someone

Kurt looked at Zack. He was back in his fever dream again, and it all meant something, it all meant something that was bigger than Kurt, something that he could write down and read to a coalition of freaks in a rundown warehouse.

Kurt got up from the computer and stood next to Zack, but more violent, and kept saying “fuck you,” over and over. Kurt kicked him again, harder, and began to like the difference between his hard sole and Zack's soft stomach. He stomped on it repeatedly. Kurt wanted to tell Zack that Zack shouldn't have done what he did, but he figured Zack knew that by what was happening. Kurt liked that he didn't have to say anything.

Kurt felt like he was crying but there were no tears. He walked up the stairs, staring vacantly at the old neighbor.

“You all right?” Kurt said.

“I'll be fine.”

They sat for a long take

“So

“I hate this place” Tayler mumbled grumpily.

“Shush

Tayler looked up at the once beautiful house

He ran his hand down the old door before opening it. How many people walked through that threshold? How many broken souls served this house? They walked inside onto the mat that covered the hardwood flooring and up the steep stairs. He remembered from his young childhood stories the townspeople told about when his great grandparents lived in the house. A coloured maid had tripped down the stairs and broke her neck. Stories about her ghost were scattered across the town. One night Tayler had tried to stay up at the bottom of the stairs

They walked down a small hall, and in the room was a small cot, it’s blankets full of holes from hungry moths. Had they really been gone that long? His sister bent down by the wall and started to lift a loose board from out of the floor. Under the board was an old dusty lunchbox, His sister trailed her fingers through the dust, before opening the latch and revealing it’s contents. Four dollars in change and something wadded up in a handkerchief. Probably something that long ago meant something to her. She stood up to face Tayler, tears in her eyes. He pursed his lips and pulled her towards him, to nestle her in his arms. She hugged him tightly, but none of them good. This house was tainted with despair. 

Generations of sadness and slavery that left an unpleasant taste in Tayler’s mouth. He grabbed hold of his sisters hand, closer and closer to the sun each step. They stopped at the top of a grassy field, the only place where good memories were kept of them. Tayler closed his eyes as he remembered his sister and him running up and down the hill. His memories clear as day. He opened them to watch with his sister the inching of the sun. First hitting his spit shined boots, then his sky blue trousers, pressed to perfection. Then his belt buckle, and his uniform’s jacket, the medals on his breast shining with honer. He squinted to look at his sister while the sun hit his eyes, finding enlightenment. Her brunette spit curls shining with health. He looked down to see with her other hand she was clenching onto the skirt of her worn flower print dress. Blood no longer covered her dress

Not too far from town but still far enough that our neighbors are a 5 minute drive away
They will always be a little gritty but while they're still warm with a little butter your mother had made they're Saturday morning cake stall worthy which is a-okay because the whole batch would be demolished before they had the chance to get cold. 

There will be an endless landscape of trees and shrubs and some wirerly gorse I always say I will pull out but never get around to that hides a little stream and a lake not to far off our property that backs into the complete wilderness. We will always be getting the odd stoat into the chicken pen, pecking away at the dirt for worms. 

We will have a couple of cats
We will have a few dogs too

I will have quit smoking tobacco by then but will obviously favour my dope plant over all my other flowers and I will check it several times a day expecting some new bud to have flourished while I was off baking the bread or getting lost in a foreign film I bought when we first met because I wanted to show you I was artsy. I will turn the leaves into curious cookies I offer to our friends who will gladly accept because

You will call our house cozy although I will call it delicate and the narow stairwell up to our loft bed will full a sense of childlike wonder every time I climb up after you've been long asleep
It will smell of the incense I insit on burning almost constantly and the wood smoke from the fire we have burning in winter but never really goes away in summer.

Sometimes we will make sweet love wrapped in our sheets
Other times we will fuck. Those are the times I'm watching you over sultry eyes as you cut the wood in the backyard and as I make you a nice cuppa to refresh you after your hard work you will grab my hips and wisper in my ear 'bend over' as you throw all inhibitions aside and taste me with loud gasps and moans

The summers will be far too hot and the winters far too cold but we will never complain as we are always prepared with and iced tea and a spliff (I started smoking tobacco again but only with pot) or a generous glass of merlot by the fire. 

We will laugh fondly at the mistakes we made and shared together and separately and I will stop caring about my weight and call my mother more often. I will invite my dad over for tea and he will politely drink our sad attempt at home brewed beer because he loves me and wants to show he approves of our lifestyle. 

We will still have sad political yearnings but I will have over come my bitter youth and we will connect all over again with photographs of our mohawks and tartan pants with knee high docs and exemplary teenage ""fuck you"" attitude.
We will gossip less and listen more realizing that life isn't worth worrying about who's screwing who. 

We will spend most of our time laughing and some of our time crying because crying is important too and we will always know how to cheer each other up even if we are the cause of each others problems but we will never be miserable because we simply just don't have time for such nonsense.  I will have learned to love myself and my flaws as well as holding yours precious.

I will flirt with natural therapy and Buddhist ideals while you read Oscar Wilde and Virgina Wolfe and we will appreciate life, wonderfully, undying, confusing, muddling, joyous bedazzlement that is this is life.

I have walked this path for as long as I can remember. The days and nights blend together, the millions fade into the distance. Occasionally, one will fall. Some are picked up by the ones who walk with them. Some, they pick themselves up, dust themselves off, and continue on their journey. But some don't get back up. They lie in the dirt, motionless. The others walk around them, or simply numb to their existence. We walk on, the sound of thousands of feet meshing into a cacophony of sound.

I grow tired of this journey. Every day I feel myself grow a little weaker, lulls me. I just wish to sleep, to rest my head. So I lie down, on the side of the road. I will not be long, for all I wish to do is rest. Just for a little while. The others continue on, marching on the same path that is the only thing they have known. But I must rest. I lay my head to the ground, and close my eyes. I must rest

Suddenly

“Why are you laying there?”

Isn’t it obvious? I am tired. I wish to sleep. And you are bothering me. Let me rest.

“No one who lies down does so simply because they are tired.”

Well

She looks at me puzzlingly, and all I want to do is be left alone so that I can finally rest. This road goes on, never-ending, and I am sick of the constant walking. I’m sick of the unwavering pace. All I want to do is rest. Is that such a crime? She is speaking again.

“You know

What is she talking about? Is she one of those who fell? Is she one of the ones who were pulled back up? I have never seen her before

“… and so they told me, 'if you are too weak to walk, I will help you. If you are too tired to walk, I will carry you. But I will not leave you to the wolves.'”

The wolves? I have never seen a wolf. I have seen nothing on this trail but the vast expanse of nothingness that rings it on both sides. But she is persistent. I have never had another on this trail interact with me in this way before. I do not know how to respond. So I tell her
“I am tired. Just let me sleep.”

She cocks her head to the side. Her mouth forms the shape of a small ‘o’. As she stands there

“If you are weak

How? How could this person show such care to one which they have never met? Slowly, the sleep in my eyes, the haze in my brain, all of it starts to disappear.

I continue to walk this path, the others help keep me on the path. I am grateful for the help of strangers. Of people who had every right to ignore my existence. I walk along this path, but I no longer feel tired. My steps are no longer weak, no longer slow. They have given me a purpose that I previously lacked.

I walk along the path. A man falls to the ground, or numb to his existence. I stop in my tracks. Looking directly at him, I ask,
“Why are you laying there?”

Isn’t it obvious? He is tired. He wishes to sleep.

“Why are you bothering me?”

I smile to myself.

“Because you cannot sleep. The path may be long

  A woman picked herself up from the concrete and looked to find her sunglasses. She found them, she saw that she was bleeding from her head.

 A man took his daughter's hand and started walking for the car. He kept hurrying and looking back to the cloud of light-grey smoke. He said, 'I don't know, baby.'
  
  A mother was sitting up on the sidewalk to see that she had no legs. The mother saw her no legs and looked for her kids. Then she knew the suffocating pain, and she almost did.  She could not hear. She could only feel the pain and the burning pepper in her nose and the cement on her back and the burning of her feet. But she yelled for the kids and then she saw a younger man moving swiftly through time. He emerged from a changing sea of empty changing colors. He moved at her and she noticed his face was round and plain with sweat glistening on his forehead and eyes that were blue and frozen calm. And then she saw nothing but she reached her arms out hoping to feel her kids. She felt his hands but she tried to fight him. Then she saw nothing and moved nothing.

The children saw their mother but the loud noise had been so loud that they could not hear and they could only watch their mother bleeding and yelling like an animal. The children watched as one

  The people swarmed her, 'Is that your mom?'

 Sirens were pulsing out in odd rhythms and men were calling over this special music and people were rushing past people rushing past people rushing. The pepper smoke was faint in the air

A man stumbled past a trash can and towards a cluster of people stopped, flailing his arms, 'It just went, 'BANG!' You know?! Just like that. And, just look!' He pointed at the place where the bomb had been, where the lookers had been looking. And he said this over again at the people, 'It just went, 'BANG!' Like that!' 

One of the lookers came over to him and put her arms around him. She gave him her water. 'It was just like, 'I know.'

It was an open and shut case

Evidence and testimony all pointed to an old lady in one of the apartments; she had fallen asleep with a lit cigarette in her mouth—several lit cigarettes—and a fire erupted shortly thereafter. Wagner and the related claimants tried to point to the Housing Supervisors as culpable, and that there was scarcely evidence of it affecting the other tenants. Indeed, an examination of the site showed little to suggest that the flames had spread beyond the confines of the one apartment.

Ramona couldn’t wait till the verdict came in. “Not Guilty”, who would almost certainly suggest that she receive a raise and be put on track to be a partner in a year or two. She smiled as she thought of her name on the firm, and the plush office they’d give her. She’d have bookcases full of ornate-looking books which she’d never read, and leather chairs for her clients to sit in—the kind that you’d always see in film adaptations of John Grisham novels.

And then the prosecution announced a surprise witness. The court became silent as the Judge ordered the bailiff:

“Bring in Kimberly Wilkins.”

The Bailiff mirrored the Judge’s order
“Bring in Ms. Kimberly Wilkins.”

The courtroom became as quiet as a sepulcher. A woman wearing a wrap over her hair and a multicolored tank-top emerged from one of the chambers and made her way to the witness stand

She took the oath, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?”

“Sure thing!” she replied.

The Prosecutor gave her a cordial wink and began his questioning.

“Ms. Wilkins--”

“You can call me Sweet Brown

“…Sweet Brown

“Well

“Describe the situation in your apartment at this time” 

“Then I thought somebody was barbecuing!”

“This was

She nodded. 

“How did you react?”

“I said ‘oh lord Jesus it’s a fire!’”

Ramona was stunned. There was something very off about this witness. If she didn’t act soon

In a panic she screamed out “Objection!”

“Grounds?” the Judge asked sternly.

Flustered and at a loss for words, barbecuing?”

The Judge, indeed all eyes in the room turned incredulously to Ramona. 

“Barbecuing at 2 AM

The Prosecutor continued. “Would you say that the fire compelled an urgent response from you?”

“I didn’t grab no shoes or nothing Jesus! I ran for my life!”

“And were you able to escape

“And then the smoke got me!” Brown hurriedly interjected.

The Prosecutor smiled. He knew this represented a turnabout

“Your witness

Ramona stood up

“Ms. Wilkins, “would you say that the smoke was of any dire consequence to your health or well-being? Would you say that it was anything but a small and fairly non-hazardous discharge, as opposed to what one might find in something such as a three-alarm fire?”

Sweet Brown looked at Ramona with disgust, bug-like.

“I got bronchitis!” she spouted

“I understand

“Ain’t nobody got time for that!” Sweet Brown interrupted. 

Silence followed, applause emerged. The audience—and the jurors—were cheering for Sweet Brown. Even the Judge was amused: the corners of his grim mouth were gradually creeping upwards. 

Sweet Brown was emboldened by the attention and flashed a toothy grin

By the end of the day, thanks to the might of Sweet Brown. ",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,

It began almost as soon as I woke up. In fact

I shower silently. I never understood people who listened to music or sang in the shower. Silence is what I liked. Even the sound of the running water made me cringe. The warm water pounded at my back. I felt something soft on my shoulder. I turned around quickly

I tried to relax again, I bent down to pick up the towel and put it back on the rack just as I saw something scurry across the tiled floor to the sliver of space between the opened bathroom door and the wall. Fuck, it has to be rats. I quickly finished shaving and went downstairs to the kitchen. 

Starting a fresh pot of coffee, sipping at my coffee, I convinced myself that it was only my imagination. Imagination? Wow, I haven’t used that in years. It was hard for me to even remember the last time my mind wandered elsewhere. Well, there were those times when I- no, I won’t go into that.

I heard a child outside, causing my fist to clench and jaws to lock. There was a sudden, loud crash behind me. I whipped around to find the coffee pot lying in hundreds of pieces on the floor. How had it fallen? Did the rat knock it over? I sighed and went to the hallway closet for rags and a broom.

I threw away the broken glass, to the tools. I really needed to clean them off from the last time I used them. I rustled through a box until I found an old poison rat trap. I opened it and saw it had already been used.

I heard the clicking of heels on the driveway outside the garage door. I sighed to myself and threw the trap away. I heard the doorbell ring and started making my way to the front door. As I was closing the garage door, but the doorbell rang again. I huffed and stomped to the front of the house. I opened the door halfway.

“Hi

I opened the door fully

“I just wanted to introduce myself. I just moved in next door

I looked down at her hand for a moment

When she pulled away, it was nice meeting you. If you ever need anything, don’t be afraid to ask.”

I flicked my tongue across my lips

I closed the door silently and wiped my face with my hand. I turned around and saw grey everywhere. Rats weren’t the cause of my shake up this morning. All around me were severed hands. Shit

**M1911**

Daniel wakes up, he turns on his back and shuts his eyes, hoping that another flashback doesn’t prevent him from losing any more sleep.

A nurse enters room 34
        	
As Daniel stands up, he is greeted by the same dismal faces that put together The Arizona State Veteran Home. There are men with missing appendages with IV’s attached and following them like children, and there are others who appear to have nothing wrong with them. Or so it seems.
        	
Daniel makes his way through the cafeteria and finds the same seat he claimed when he was 71
        	
Daniel checks his wrist watch. It’s 8:37. “Good, listening to the same small talk among the veterans concerning which board game they want to play or how beautiful the daisies are when they’re in season.
        	
At 8:45 Daniel makes the trek back to his room. Of all the below average days Daniel has had
        	
Andrew was a student at a local high school. He came to see Daniel on the weekdays usually around 3. Andrew would help Daniel with puzzles, juxtaposed to the men who lived with Daniel in this prison. Andrew was at the Veteran Home for a school project.

The project included serving 50 hours of community service and coming up with a final video as the culmination of his service project. Unbeknownst to Daniel

Daniel was sitting at the table which held the borders of his puzzle in place. He patiently picked up pieces, he simply put it down and moved on to the next one. Just as he found a piece which fit into two others, completing the rotor of the helicopter, a baby started crying. Daniel’s eyes became unfocused and he was immediately taken back to another place.

This place was a lot different than his room. There were trees, were pointing their guns and firing at the unarmed victims. Daniel was unable to shoot his gun, and only stood in shock. “How could people murder others so mercilessly?” he wondered, too afraid to speak out against this act of injustice.

Then the white walls started coming back in to focus. His hands were cramping. He looked down at them and the knuckles were the same bleach white they had been this morning as they clutched the end of the table. He looked at the puzzle

Daniel was positioned outside on a wooden bench. The nurse who witnessed his flashback brought him a glass of water and two more Prozasin pills. He used the same routine as he did earlier. As Daniel sat in the shade, a daughter sits with her father Al who appears to be too skinny for his own his clothes. Her body language shows patience and caring, and she flashes a smile at Daniel as she catches him staring.

Daniel also has a daughter. Her name is Madison. Madison lives in New Mexico with her husband, and that was after his previous surgery, almost two years ago, just to check up on him. Madison has never once visited the nursing home where Daniel stays, and he believes if she saw this jail cell he has been living in for the past six years that she’d take him out of the institution immediately and let him live on his own. Remembering his daughter’s blatant lack of concern for him, Daniel retreats to the cafeteria, where lunch will be held shortly.

In the cafeteria sits down at the out of tune Grand piano. One of Emmett’s grandchildren sits down at the piano and begins to play “Happy Birthday.” Soon enough, is partaking in a raspy rendition of a song celebrating this man who is one year closer to his death. As the residents finish their lunch, pieces of chocolate cake are passed around. “My favorite!” says Daniel, as he is handed a piece by one of the grandchildren of Emmett, hoping to conjure up a smile from her delicate face. Daniel has always had a soft spot for children. They seem so innocent and naïve, hidden from the evil acts committed on March 16, 1968 by the troops in Daniel’s Battalion towards the citizens of My Lai.

Daniel waits for Emmett’s family to leave the nursing home before he goes back to Room 34. As he arrived in his room, jeans, and baseball cap he normally wears. Daniel dressed himself and made his way towards his bed. He sat down on the bed and faced the bedside table. He jotted down a note and tucked it under his pillow. He got up, closed the door, and returned to the bed. He opened the bedside tables drawer, removed the same magazines and rags just as he had done earlier, and revealed his most prized possession. The M1911. He sat down on the bed and held it in his hands, standard protocol for the Marines. The weapon had three bullets left. That was two more than he needed. He took two of them and placed them under the pillow next to the note. He inserted the clip back into the sidearm and cocked it

Daniel’s senses heightened. Everything in his room was silent, a familiar face was present with Daniel. It was his brother Tom. And they were running on their family’s farm in Indiana. Then Daniel’s eyes went out of focus again. This time, he didn’t return to the white walls of his room. He was walking across a stage, with a purple and gold gown on. He had a diploma in his hand and a smile on his face as the May sun beat down on his high school graduation ceremony. As he looked out in the crowd he found his family, and as he made eye contact with Tom, his eyesight began to fade again. When he was able to see, Daniel was aiming down the sight of an m16. He was at the shooting range at the base camp in Singapore. Daniel had won the marksman award for Private First Class and he had a keen eye. Just as he pulled the trigger of the m16, darkness. 

Daniel fell forward as a pool of blood formed around his head. Nurses rushed in and an ambulance was called. Daniel was deceased before he hit the floor. The M1911 that had once kept him safe in the jungle eventually ended his life.

After further examining the room



Dear Andrew

Please do not blame yourself for this.

Thank you for spending time with me and impacting my life in a positive manner. Unfortunately

Love

TWO FEET OF SNOW

	Things have changed. I guess you know that. But not just in the obvious way. 
Some people  accept the way things are now and I guess that's the easiest way to survive. I wish I was like them
A shitty day used to mean a lot of things, that was 'an awful day' that was the what used to be normal. But today death is commonplace, and if your best friend is bit by a walker and you have to put a bullet in him, that's just another shitty day.
Before it happened
I've been snowed in for the past month, but now I want us all to survive. And the only way to do that is to tell a story and hope people learn from it. This place won't be secret for long- a big house in the middle of nowhere, in the spring this will probably be a territory worth killing for, my words will be found eventually, but for now it's a tomb. And this is my last will and testament. 

 * * * * 

I guess I can skip the first few months, some I really did just lose. My sister, for example, she was a financial adviser for a fortune five hundred company in London, but she traveled almost daily. I think she was in the  Netherlands when it started here. I don't know where it began really, it seemed to be everywhere all at once. But phones went down pretty soon and I'm ashamed to say I called an ex before I called my sister, and one call is all you got. 
I used to call her Bambi so I'll use that name here, but then again she never gave us reason to. We were left with a drunk who among other things liked to take his failures out on his children. My sister learned quick that to live outside his rule she'd have to be successful in something. We never had money, so she chose that. Community college and a few math scholarships later she was on her way to a well paying job as an assistant a year after graduation. She moved up the ladder pretty quick, all she had to do was show her bosses that what they were doing was wrong how they could make more money if they followed her advice and it was off to the races for Bambi. 
She felt bad about leaving me, she had a place in Paris she couldn't give up- living in France was her dream since she was young, and even then she was never there long enough to enjoy it. I told her it was okay, that we would meet up when she came stateside but that turned out to be once or twice a year at the most. She sent me money whenever I was too broke to decline, and she called at least once a month. I can't blame her for succeeding, and I wouldn't want to even if I could. The honest to goodness truth is I was so proud of her for doing what she did, for keeping her head down and just doing the work- for enduring our father until she didn't have to anymore, or one of Bukowski's barflies. I was living on my own above a bar that never closed
These are the things that make a writer happy. Not that I was a real writer. More like a professional imitator of styles. If I was in the mood for poetry I'd look at some E.E Cummings and do my best to steal everything he’d written
Then
I couldn't get a convertible but I'd been making do with what I had my whole life. What's a convertible compared to a thoughtfully over compensated sound system? I swear just one hour on the road and my throat was fire-red and scratchy from singing full volume by myself.  I spent a quiet night at a roadside motel
But when I went to check out there was no one there. I looked around but I couldn't wait much longer so I wrote down my name and credit card number on a notepad and left. I accidentally took the pen with me- when I got to the car I stopped and almost went back to return it. I decided they probably had plenty of pens, he was almost too drunk to hand me my key. As it turned out, the decision about not returning the pen was what saved my life. And if you think too much on things like that- well if I just did that, or, if I didn't remember to do this- you'll drive yourself mad. Alive is alive is alive. And that's all there is to it. I said I wouldn't go into those first few months but, I guess if I'm to tell you the whole story I should start at the beginning. It was still summer, the hottest I remember. In certain situations, in prison it's what are you in for? Now

He stood there with the bullet just inches away from my face. 

“You won’t do it.” 

I knew he didn’t have the heart to.

“Ha

I saw it coming. “MOTHERF...”

He barely flinched; he was still in the same pose, counting the silence between us.
 
Amazing how much pain one could withstand when expecting it. 
Even more amazing is what one is capable of doing on an irrational impulse.

The blood dripped from his fingers like hot wax.

The smoke from the barrel had subsided and I stared harder into the mirror. He pointed the gun away from my face and towards his own head. 

“You won’t do it.”

It was an awkward pause to end all awkward pauses, if anything, I should say.

She looked out the window of my car, then observing how they seemed to be asynchronous to her blinks, which stuck acrimonious dissonance to the frequency of the flashes of light – the heartbeat like rhythm of sixty pulses per minute should not be so casually disregarded. Never the less, my heart did skip a beat when she started to open her mouth. Finally, the silence would be over, and her beautiful shock waves of compressed air would resonate in my audile canals.

She let out a small cough...

Okay... maybe she is just clearing her throat. Now the talking will commence. She’ll have some carefully crafted comments to calm my nerves.

It was an awkward pause to end all awkward pauses

I clenched my eyes closed tightly. A dangerous feat while driving at night

""So... promise not to freak out."" I opened my eyes to try to gage her reaction.

She didn't so much as bat an eyelash. Her perfect little hand did not leave the impossibly smooth skin on her cheek as said, has it ever stopped someone from freaking out?""

""I don—""

""I mean, under normal circumstances, should I freak out about whatever is about to happen?' And then bam they are on the defensive. And when the moment comes and passes, they are left saying to themselves, 'Wow... you know what? I wasn't going to freak out about that. I wonder why they think I would have. I mean, should I have? But I didn't. Maybe I'm the freak.'""

I processed this for a while, however I was expecting an inquiry into to what I was trying to say.

It was an awkward pause to end all awkward pauses

Maybe I should just drop it. Scrap the plan. It wasn't going to work anyway. I started counting the headlights from on-coming traffic and tried to keep track of what that number would visually look like in binary or hex.

""So

Small talk? Really not playing towards my strengths here... maybe she would be impressed if I told her about how I had been planning for the conversation I were trying to have for a few months now. Is that creepy? I don't know the rules for this. It is good to be prepared

""Work was work.""

I couldn't take it anymore... I had to just go with it.

""So, but..."" I swallowed hard. There is no going back or playing this off if this goes poorly. Maybe there is, if I was a bit more suave and not sweating as much. Fuck it. Here we go: ""Would you like to see my spaceship?""

It was an awkward pause to end all awkward pauses. This was the next even more awkward pause.

My exposed, pure instincts drove me to force my body through the impossibly large heaps of glossy, powdery snow. Of course, in all cases instincts must be driven by something, and as my feet moved, the very relevant fact that a whole pack of wolves were making mad dashes through the snow, nipping at the air my heels passed was the very rational drive towards my minds instinct to run until those wolves
I barely made it up the hill ahead, smiling upon seeing me being chased by these wild animals. My dear wife proceeded to possess a large sincere grin, coincided with her waving to me as if she hadn’t seen me in years. The wolves barked behind me as I ran to her, hoping I could sweep her off her feet and get the two of us to safety. I sprinted to her, reaching out to grab her. 
Suddenly my perceived reality was nothing but pure whiteness, none of these things could be true. Everything felt too peaceful, too real. More real then anything I’ve ever felt, then I focused my eyes on what was in front of me. She stood once again, but this time she didn’t look happy to see me, not offering a warm grin and a wave. No, tears made their way down her soft, only watch her... taking in her overarching sadness. I watched as her right hand made its way upwards, looking at me directly in the eyes as she slowly…squeezed the trigger.

I awoke and desperately, she’s gone. She had been for around seven months. I sighed, feeling distressed like I often do after waking up from a night terror. I stared at the ceiling of my quarters. It felt like I was in fucking solitary confinement when I slept without her by my side.
 I rolled on my side and listened to the soft hissing coming from the release of pressure in heat valves outside my designated quarters

Our ship has been traveling across the Milky Way galaxy for the past five years, capable of sustaining life for over eighty billion humans, in attempt to halt the overpopulation issue that has ravaged my dear home planet. I was selected along with my wife to travel on this ship to attempt to procreate and attempt to progress human life on another planet. 
Five years aboard a cramped piece of metal, or maybe it was because I didn’t love her enough, but all I know now is that she’s gone.

I arose from my bunk, just enough for myself to navigate; all the ships passengers and crew were asleep. I made my way down the hallway that led towards the observation deck. My steps echoed throughout the hallways, nobody was around, I couldn’t be more alone. I entered the observation deck; even the various computers in the room were off, leaving myself in a very dark room to observe the most magnificent sight I’ve ever peered upon. 

At the front of the room was the large, I couldn’t look away it was so empowering. Land stretched out in all directions from where I could see. I could see the water, the trees, the deserts, the mountains, the plains all from the stiff metal bench I sat upon. I placed my hand on the glass, staring at the various biomes visible to my naked eye. It was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, I felt as I if I could just walk down from the ship onto the patch of desert in my field of view, was it truly a bad thing? I’ll always be alone without her

As I sat, it didn’t have the slightest significance to me. I just stayed where I was, staring at the sights. Announcements were made on the intercom several times, but they didn’t catch my attention. I heard the voices dim as they made their way to another part of the ship, nobody was present once again. This made me smile solemnly, realizing that it was just me and her in my beautiful thoughts again. The hours passed and I didn’t move, I watched as the drop capsules containing all the passengers that were once aboard the ship descended towards the planet. The sight of the various drop capsules began to become smaller until they faded from my field of vision; as if the planet with all its empowering features absorbed them into its vast lands.



I was truly alone now; my thoughts were the only nurturing aspect left with me. And as I attempted to become fully content with my situation, experiencing the love and hate, the questions left unanswered… The true feelings that in embed themselves deep within my soul. They would come to understand that they can never truly understand the reason things happen, the mysteries that arise when everyone operates as a collective whole. Nobody could answer this, not on earth, not on the moon and defiantly not fucking here. This will to live that pushed these so called “colonists” to land on planets exactly like this is the human condition in a finely wrapped nutshell of mysteries that drive people to do what they do. 
I was supposed to be one of them, she clouded my internal judgment, distorted my constant strive to live and flourish. With her possessing my every thought, it’s like a hell spawned demon had ravaged my mind with his sly manipulative thoughts to achieve his primary goal; create a psychotic canvas within my unstable dreamscape of a mind. 
I stood, I simply did not think as if I were an unconscious hunk of mass that had no perception of time. It was ages, but the process of the sun fading behind the planet was so peaceful and slow that it melded the time together as a whole, subjective experience that would change depending on what mind state you’re in. 
But in this case I wasn’t thinking anymore, I’m starting to question my sanity, she’s not fucking here, yes she is, and she’s in front of me, right? Fuck I can contradict my observations all day, anything I state to be true or false can be proved wrong internally through the methods of pure thought. Alone, so everything here was as I saw it

Double take, her display of emotion made my entire self feel warm with the empowering feeling of undeniable love. A harsh smile became strung across my face, accompanied by a single tear of the purest of joy. I reached out and realized the glass still stood in between her and me. I slammed the palm of my hand hard into the glass, my smiles quickly fading into a devastating frown. I swiftly made my way to the nearby fire extinguisher hanging on a nearby wall. I lifted it carelessly, holding it high above my head. I looked to the glass, staring her in the eyes. I darted my feet along the floor, keeping my vision focused on my direct target. I propelled my body
The glass slammed forward, our lips locked in the most powerful experience of interconnected body and soul derived directly from a kiss. It was like we were one with each other, like the universe’s fabric of material existence tore apart around us. As if any worry, fear, ambition or desire didn’t matter to me anymore. The white world around me slowly began to dim as if the sun were setting again; I kept my lips locked to hers. Time didn’t mean anything anymore, this moment couldn’t end as any concept of time that was once in tune with my brain was now gone. I was with her for eternity now, stuck within the one moment that made my feel vibrant and full of the emotion that made me once love the universe I strived in.

His father had warned him not to go looking for the beast
He had come prepared

Crouched in the shrubs, a hazy orange glow meant a dust storm was on it's way.
The beast turned away, his padded footclaws silent on the snow. 

The beast stopped eating and sniffed the air with a fierce sound. Before J'nah could plunge his spear into the vital spot, blood dripping. It meant to defend its lair at any cost.
In his lessons at the younglings' council, like the warriors of old. At that moment, he thought it was more likely to be ""J'nah the Swift Coward.""

The Krjussich lunged at him, the beast whipped around and spat a dart at the youth. He felt the sting as it lodged in his arm. The paralyzing numbness kicked in almost immediately, rendering his spear arm as limp as his grandmother's home-cooked  Bessintaa Noodles. His spear fell to the ground. The Kjrussich howled and raised all four arms in a threatening display. J'nah found himself against the wall of the outcropping, trapped.

Just overhead, firing jets of flame downwards. It was all J'nah could do to shield his eyes from the incredible could of dust that arose as the thing lowered itself slowly upon it's pillars of flame. He heard another terrifying howl, from the Kjrussich, but felt to fangs or claws. 

He opened his eyes as the dust began to recede. The metal thing had burnt the beast to a shouldering crisp with it's jets of flame, except for one spot: a huge glass eye. It seemed to be staring straight at him.

There was no way to know what this thing was, instead seizing the chance to run home as quickly as his legs could carry him. The dust storm beg and to whip into a frenzy just as he reached the door. He knew that by the next morning, the metal thing and the remains of the Kjrussich would be buried beneath the ever shifting sand and snow. His father would be proud of him, though. He knew that on this day, he had earned his surname: ""J'nah Spear-Arm"".

1362275358.0,19jyek,Aisle 13,heretheworld,4,1,4,"This story is too long to post in its entirety

*This short story is a dream I had the night of January 1, I woke with this dream flooding my mind, a powerful urge to turn it into a story came through me and I immediately opened my laptop and began to write. In the dream the protagonist was myself, but for the sake of storytelling I have made some creative changes, mostly to do with names.
The dream was profound

**Aisle 13: Crackers and Cookies**

My name is John, almost every one of the 35 Sales Associates are girls. The only other men working are Phil, a Sales Associate and Matt the Security Manager.
The girls in the store actively flirt with me, but it's more than that. People like me; I'm funny, charismatic, good looking and a great boss. Sometimes my father visits me at work, he's proud of what I do. He enjoys offering me advice and sharing stories from his fruitful life.

On a regular day some time ago
Sitting in produce was a pallet full of boxes of crackers waiting to be brought to aisle 13. Nobody felt like moving the boxes

While I stood in produce, but I told the employees to turn a blind eye to this. His family was poor, the least I could do was allow him to take some groceries home from time to time.

I went back to produce and looked at the pallet filled with the boxes of crackers. On a box of Westley's Crunchy Crackers was a cartoon cow with a comic bubble above his head, what's this all about anyway?* This question sank deep into my belly, invading my very soul.

There is a deep silence within that few people ever experience, tangible, real, satisfying, screaming out loud silence. The question hit me like a ton of bricks, a question so deep and so profound it would take an eternity to answer. A question found right there on a box of crackers in front of me: *Excuse me, what's this all about anyway?*
That fucking cow had shaken the very foundation of my life. What was it all about anyway? What was I doing working at Superstore

There was a cartoon mouse to the right of the cow, I thought and certainly not the answer to this deep and unsettling question. I asked the nearest Sales Associate, Wendy, a girl who'd had a crush on me since I started working at that branch. I offered her my words, ""Excuse me, what's this all about anyway?"" Perplexed and taking my stunned, exposed and vulnerable disposition as an open letter to flirt with me, a grin I had seen on her face a million times before

All day long I pondered the question. There were hundreds of possible answers

It was closing time so I went to the security booth to clock out. I was well acquainted with the Security Manager, and he loved the girls. A few of them would give him their unsolicited attention, but they didn't love him like they loved me. But there was something he hated, something I only began to understand when I read that damn box. It began to itch in the back of my mind like a razor blade. He hated the trap of everyday mundane life. Matt would often share his philosophy with me, ""You work so you can buy a house so you can buy more things to put inside your house so you can continue working. If you fall and love and have a couple of kids along the way you're lucky.""

I worked my way through the series of regular conversation obstacles: *How's it going? What are you doing tonight? Have you asked Cindy out yet?* He had a crush on Sales Associate named Cindy, ""Excuse me, what's it all about anyway?"" Matt quickly answered, not this. Not this, I thought, but what else? We're doing a public service and in exchange we receive great benefits: a pension, a dental plan

I went home and all night long I asked myself the question, it had to come out.
I sped through my morning routine

I walked into Superstore and there he was
Matt kept an archive of video footage from the security cameras in the building. He would hold the footage for three months
I told him my plan, he was in. All the planning had come to me in the dream, I knew exactly what to do.

Coming down from the ceiling of Superstore are giant metal beams, the store executives had been discussing renovations. I pushed for the renovations to happen sooner than later. All the metal beams were stripped and polished and the screws were replaced. Matt cut a hole in one of the hollowed out beams, the beam above aisle 13. The hole was invisible to the naked eye, we would be able to open and close it without any evidence that it even existed. Our alibi would be: we were working at Superstore the night of the bank robbery.

The night came and we dressed in black, spray painted masks. Our plan was fool-proof. We decided to walk from downtown so it would be impossible to conclude that we came from the area. It was a long walk. As we trekked through the ghetto I thought Sim, the African I serve at Superstore must live in a neighborhood like this. We took shortcuts through people's yards and eventually arrived at the bank down the street from Superstore. We went in and the rest is a blur, I have no idea how we robbed the bank or what took place inside. All I know is when we left we had a hard drive the size of my thumb that contained what would be, with the help of Matt's computer expertise, a lot of money.

Following our plan Matt and I walked away from the bank, I had worn something casual underneath my bank robbing outfit. I buried the black clothes and mask into a nearby garbage bin and climbed over a fence that took me to the Superstore parking lot. A police car came screeching down the street into the parking lot. I opened the door to my car that was parked outside and got in.

The police came to my car window and asked who I was and what I was doing. I told them casually that I was just getting off from my shift at Superstore. They asked me to step inside the building so they could have a word with me. When we got inside Matt was already at the Security booth in his employee uniform. They asked him if he knew who I was and he answered yes. They asked him if I had been working that night

Matt had tampered with the security footage from the past few months, it would be obvious the tape was fake. Being the manager I knew where every product in the store was so we gathered footage from when everything looked the same as it did the night of the robbery, it was perfect. Footage of Matt wasn't necessary, the security booth wasn't visible on any cameras.

Matt had already placed the thumb drive we stole from the bank in the hole in the hollowed out ceiling beam. The police finished their questioning and let us go home.

They decided that the robbers were two African men because the masks we wore and the description they received from bank employee. Matt and I decided to lie low and not spend the money for a couple of months.",,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/19jyek/aisle_13/

To Graham this was not much more peculiar than the years before, but the look on his face was queer when he realized that Graham had made the journey by himself.  Even queerer still was the small meat pie, the shopkeeper's daughter slipped him as he stepped out.  The pie was less than filling but tasty never the less.   Graham headed home, thinking of the daughter and wondering what her name could be.  The only woman Graham had ever known was his mother Margery, but he doubted they would have the same name.

Anticipation began to settle up on him, a crucial and expensive ingredient for the dessert, which Graham had journeyed to town.

After a while the pie was ready, Graham shuffled to his straw mat, to lie down.  He was not used to such rich food, and it began to make him feel strange.  His face became flush with heat, and in response Graham unbuttoned his shirt.  Beginning to perspire, he next unlaced his britches, removing them with a toss towards the corner.

Margery, his vision began to blur.  When this happened, he began to panic until Margery whispered that it would be alright, it was only the dessert and that soon all would be well.   He was reassured by his mother's smile, as he closed his eyes.

As soon as his eyelids descended, she dabbed herself with the juice of the snow berries.  Next, she laid out several items on the table.  They would be needed when the sun rose.  But now it was time for dessert.

When she slowly lowered herself into her place on the straw mat beside Graham, surely his mother had arranged this.  With a dim realization he thought it might be the storekeeper's daughter. 

With the lust of youth he ripped his small clothes off and next her gown.  With a before unknown skill, the heat began to fade, and Graham laid on his back and contentedly slipped into sleep with his arms and legs tangled amongst the woman's.
Margery woke early, and laid the ingredients beside their respective bowls.  It wouldn't hurt to have everything measured and ready for sunrise.

He awoke slowly, Graham began to understand what his mother was whispering.  It was a list.  No, not really a list, but steps.  A list of actions he realized as she spoke of cooking the rabbit and the snow berries.  

Graham was dismayed when he learned of the powder in his stew, all of it, and only the blood of a living relative infused with the pain and fear of death could make the potion powerful enough to work.

Graham realized with a chill that his mother thought him immobilized.  He stared at her as she came back to her place beside him on the mat and began to caress his cheek.  He remained expressionless as she spoke of her first husband Graham

As she held his cheek she brought the blade to his throat.  With a rage, this was not on the list would be her last murderous thought.  If gasping is fulfilling an action, then it could said it was her last. Graham leaned forward, kissed his lover once more, and connected the knife with Margery's heart.

With a fresh day, the shopkeeper, obviously pleased with himself, asked if he had enjoyed Helen's gift.

I check my watch. I don't remember when I got here. Let's guess a few hours. I've seen the same old man hobble by around five times. I don't know if he's trying to look at me or what. 

My legs have fallen asleep. I shift my weight and ow, pain is shooting up my body. I know it'll fade in a couple minutes, but I'm almost in tears. It hurts. 

The more I think about it, bang, hey, I'm still here. 

Got no talents, gold jewelry in my pocket. I can sell it if I have to, if he decides that we're running off somewhere. He's not the kind of guy to just drop everything and run off, though, while I'm kind of like that. Just run. Or drive. 

I imagine he's talking to me. About the ocean, he's got it all planned out. It's simple. He'd say, ""Hey, five seconds ago, when you came over, that was the past. And five seconds from now, it'll be the future and we're going to still be sitting together, right? Too fast for you to even notice it."" 

Right. But he's not sitting next to me now and everything's gray. The future is scarier - will it go by so fast I'll miss it? Suddenly I'll be some hunched old crone

Why didn't I bring my phone? I could really use some music right now. No lyrics are coming to mind; the whine of cars is too loud. I curl up on the bench and squeeze my eyes shut. 

It's even darker under my eyelids. When I was little

Footsteps -- his car -- no

He likes my hair. My face. He says I have funny arms. I don't get how you can have funny arms

He says I'm smart for my age. He won't let me down

What did my sister say about him? I think she likes him. Actually I'm pretty sure she does. She's always turning red and speaking really, twisted, and true - what is it? 

This'll bother me all day. The cars speeding by are starting to blend together into this black streak. No red. Not even white. 

At least it isn't gray. I can't remember if his eyes are blue or gray - or what the rest of his face looks like. Suddenly he's a blur just like everything else. 

Is he just someone I've imagined? Am I waiting for someone who'll never show up? I don't even have my phone to see the words he's written me. But those could've been imagined too

Everything's just one big maybe. Maybe he'll show up and maybe my aunt will be here too. Maybe she'll wash the ocean away again. 

My sister. Cute little idiot. Where's she? Probably thinking I'm in a mood again. 

One, four, five. I'm in the future. The present.

'The 99 Club? And what exactly is that?' the King inquired.

The advisor replied, place 99 Gold coins in a bag and leave it at this servant's doorstep.'

When the servant saw the bag

He began to count them. After several counts, no one would leave 99 coins!'

He looked everywhere he could

From that day, and castigated his family for not helping him make that 100th gold coin. He stopped singing while he worked.

Witnessing this drastic transformation, 'Your Majesty, the servant has now officially joined The 99 Club.'

He continued, saying to themselves: 'Let me get that one final thing and then I will be happy for life.' We can be happy, even with very little in our lives, but the minute we're given something bigger and better, we want even more!

I know how that felt to be king for one day in the eyes of the ignorant and it was glorious and it was sad. I felt so lonely like a typewriter on ashes made from burning pages it had created all on its own. Do you think about that when you’re alone? I like to think that people see the world like I do

I would always walk along the highways late at night with the sun still blazing in the back of my head. The neural synapses have been cut from my pathway since I met tongue to tongue with the beast of my own sanity. It ripped apart on the day I became that own monster inside myself, that little man of a boy?” Do you see the reasons my pupils turn to coal when I place the paper to miniscule little bursts of wet skin placed centimeters from teeth that could rip that same skin? I’m happy to be free of noise but the sound was a constant lullaby to the darkness in my fingers. They drew little lines all brazen and bolded in a pattern of chaos. I loved myself then, when I could feel the intelligence like a friend knocking on my senses. The feeling of deep connection to the earth was heavy in my ears. That’s who I am when no one is watching. I am that ghost on the side of a close to empty highway. Life’s ironies are most potent when no one’s around to witness.

I loved myself then, I am lost, I am lost, I am lost. I am dead and gone and not coming back, dead and gone, dead and gone, dead and gone. How can you love yourself if you don’t recognize yourself inside your head? Are we dead

I am so guilty; I hated you all so much. I took that hate deep within me and I turned it into oil. It spurted from my mouth and got into all my muscles tensing them up. It made my face ugly with anger and pity. It made my eyes shine with the light of a false ideology. I am the author of a cow sewn jacket full of fleas and chemicals. I am the beef within the external heart ripped by the hand of a brother who craved the feeling of organs and tissue in his head. It’s a chemical imbalance and it’s a way of living without guilt. I took the time to hug you when I was too tired to understand I needed comfort until it was too late. I laid within your warmth and I felt the lining of your smile on my skin where it touched my body. It was strange how I loved you in that moment and then grew steadily wearier the longer I let myself crave my own head over the world. I killed myself in the eve of that waking solitude. 

That’s what we are all wanting, ugly shame. Have you ever looked at a picture so long that it blurred inside itself and became so meaningless that nothing seemed real anymore? Have you ever seen something ugly and thought it was the most precious thing in the world? It represented the hurt and yourself and your mind and our life so well, that it became beautiful? Is that what this is? Have you ever looked at something that others found ugly and thought it was beautiful?

I wound up lifting my hand to the sun when I walked outside for the first time in a week. I holed myself up just to fix my panic. My panic inside, please, please don’t stand with your skin on me. I fled, I fled, I fled away from you.

She was the type of girl that would cause an ordinary man to choke on a conversation, yet he had bravely taken her up with charm and confidence.  ""We're leaving in 5 minutes,"" Tory interjected.

 wounds. I brushed the thick
 roots

else in this world would have ever accepted me so quickly and
 graciously

 many years
 answered in words of silence

	‘I have been built upon.’ said he with the rotting plank in his branches;
 with the scars in his skin he said ‘I have been wounded.’; ‘I have been 
shelter for many lives.’ he said with the hole in his trunk and the abandoned
 birds-nest in his uppermost branch. He spoke very little
	‘I have travelled far
yet I fear I have seen less than you have
 singular area. I have found little happiness to no avail
 by my solitude which hangs over my head as a metal weight. I am not so
 wise as you are
 before you
 in my life will be ill choices.’ I said
	The tree listened well
	‘I have no one on this earth who listens so well as you

	No advice was given to me that day
 but it held me tightly in its roots and I felt warm inside
 cold weather. The tree accepted me blindly

	I walked to the woods that day with only the intention of feeling the
 cold air nip at my exposed skin; I left the woods that day enlightened
 inspired by the kindness and unconditional love which the tree so openly
 gave out. I was changed

Running, leaping, biting, tearing. Screams, blood, scattered ashes of the fire. Roaring, scaring. Feasting.


I wake up on the forest floor, I turn quickly, dropping my pants and falling into a low crouch. There is a man standing behind a tree with a camera phone. In the early stages after the metamorphosis, I still retain some of my speed and strength. I charge forward and before the man has time to react I am in front of him, lifting him into the air by his throat. I pitch my voice low and intimidating and I growl, “What are you doing?” The man confuses me then. Rather than being afraid of the man holding him inches off the ground by his throat, he spits in my face. “You killed my friend, “But now I know who you are,” I groan, the man is gone. He has fled from the monster.


After gathering my pack and brush, and it is now nearing noon. Finally, I arrive at the campsite. There are still tents, and ashes and logs from a long-dead fire are scattered across the area. But the sight in the center of the camp makes me sick, and I turn aside and vomit into the shrubbery. I apparently had not finished my meal last night. Lying in the center of the camp, in a shiny pool of sticky crimson, is a human arm. I had come out to this forest so I wouldn't hurt anyone. Now I am a murderer.  I stagger sickly back the way I had come, but every time I start in are that I marked that way, to stop it. I never remember what happens


I return to my circle in the dirt and the markings I had made to attract the Wolf. I've always preferred to treat that part of me as a different person altogether. In a way, no higher conscience. It hunts, that’s all it does. Its sole purpose in life is to hunt and to kill. Luckily, I can never remember what the Wolf does. I am glad of this. I believe that if I knew what the Wolf did…what I did…I would kill myself. Suddenly, I want to leave. I do not wish to remain here any longer. So, taking my pack, I head home.


It is a long walk home, but given recent events, it did not rank high on my priorities. What did rank high was finding a job that would allow me to take at least three days a month for vacation time. I didn’t want to transform anywhere near my small home town in the suburbs of Austin. I found a job as an author. As it turns out, having undergone the transformation several times myself, I was able to write a rather good werewolf fantasy novel that sold decently. It was perfect for me. Successful enough that I could make a living off it, but not so successful as to make me a celebrity and attract attention. A few people recognize me now and then, but not a lot. I come out of the woods, and it is now nearing 6:30. I’m quite hungry at this point, only took me twenty minutes for me to get it. As I chew, and I cut my finger on one. I look down and see what was in my mouth. It is a fingernail. A human fingernail. I grimace and look at my burger


I open the door to my apartment and start to turn on the lights when something stops me. It’s what I've come to call my Wolf sense, and a couch cushion is on the floor. I see him then, or at least his fingers poking out from under the couch. It’s a usual, unimaginative hiding place. After each person I've killed, someone has seen it. Most of the time they do not know who I am, but six times I've been discovered. Six times I've had to fight for my life and kill as a human. After the third time, I enrolled in martial arts classes. For the fourth time now

 I decide not to arouse suspicion until I am in a good position, directly in front of the couch, but I do not turn the TV on. Instead, I watch the reflection in the TV screen, pretending to be texting someone on my phone, as the man rises up from behind the couch. He is wielding a knife. As he creeps closer, I tense my body in anticipation for action. Finally, taking his legs out from under him. As he falls


The sound of a gunshot echoes loudly in the small apartment. I look up and see a man in a suit standing in the open doorway. He is holding a gun. Looking down at the man beneath me
 “Detective Bradford, “And you killed my partner last night, you goddamned animal.”  The coldness has now spread to my arms and my legs, and I topple sideways off the man from the forest. He gets up and spits on my face.
 “But you missed one
“Come on


As they exit, but these men wouldn't know that. I can be killed by anything; it’s the Wolf who is invincible. It’s the Wolf who killed Bradford’s partner. I open my mouth to speak to these two men as they leave, but I cannot move, and I cannot feel my tongue in my mouth. But I want to say something. I so desperately want to speak to these men. These men who killed me, assuming that I was a monster like the Wolf. These men who assume that it is acceptable to kill me because, in their eyes, I am not human. To them, a dumb

Charlie Sacks was as sick as they come. He had taken to bed nearly three days ago and didn't say a word about it. The housemaid Martha waited on him hour to hour, the ailment seemed to lie in his nasal cavity. The man suffered from a clogged nasal chimney, due to a snot and spit build up, resulting in a whooping fever! Charlie, as a sturdy grown man, knew the only true remedy was a pampering spa and a warm bed. Martha had prepared a bath and Mr. Sacks found comfort in its bubbly waters. From the womb to the sack he did leap. Leaving the bath only to flounder back into bed. The fluffed feathers of his nest proved the greatest comforter, for it was in it's billows he could delve into the latest issue of StarExplorer in peace. 

Alas

""Evening sir

""I be but a humble traveller mum

""Well

""Thank you

""Certainly"" 

At once, as well as the embroidered chair in which I was placed. The leather had taken the shape of my body and I felt for a moment a grace of rest. 

""You're meal

""Yes

""Oh yes

""This is his gothic collection. Everyone from Dorian Grey to The Oval Portrait hangs here. Let's just say we scurry past this part. Shall we?""

I could see her distress. For most of the men and women that hung here were depicted in death. My good eye gazed on scenes of immurement

The last floor presented a welcomed change in the form of landscapes. As we crossed the hall to Sacks bedroom

Martha gently opened the door and announced us to the figure laying in bed.

""Master Sacks

The silence made me wonder if he was resting eternally. At last he spoke

With a nod to Martha I lurched over to his bedside and from my cloak retrieved a sack of cherry tomatoes. 

""These are picked from a place I doubt even you've been, only four tomatoes shall you eat before sunrise. Any more, will have you. Indeed, save them for tomorrows light.""

""Tomatoes? Is this a folly?""

""None

""Very well then

As I exited to the hallway

""No more than four"".

Martha allowed me to finish my meal and then filled my canteen with water, but because I knew sunrise would be here in a matter of hours and I wanted a good distance behind me when it came.

Within an hour

""My doctor always said

By the time he was chewing his fourth tomato

""Heavens

""Martha it seems our weary traveller spoke truth. Those tomatoes did a wonder on my senses. I feel fit enough to read in the dignity of my own library. First

""Certainly

Master Sack's toes wiggled around the fire heat as he sunk into his chair. A few adjustments were made until he felt the familiar shape again. Martha came in and left a tall glass of milk on the table beside him. She left him to read StarExplorer. A wonderful serial involving flying machines in space and men with laser guns finding lost princesses. The adventure had pulled him in for nearly an hour when he was distracted to see

""A wonder."" he thought.

As he continued to read, Sacks was distraught to find that a cold chill instantly cascaded through his bones. The impact caused him to drop his magazine onto the floor. As he reached down to pick it up, a searing pain shot through his lower back. He tried to scream, but only gasped, for his breath was failing him. Sweat was accumulating and as he wiped his brow he felt only wrinkles of elderly skin. He willed himself a sip of milk. When he lay the glass back on the table he saw a line of red smearing down the side of the glass. Could his mouth be bleeding? He flustered over to the mirror to inspect. Yet the startling sight of his ghost and the ripe taste of tomato stopped him. A vision of auburn apple fields and infinite galaxies filled his eyes. Master Sacks fell to the floor. The old boy was dead.

No doubt Martha discovered him within the hour. Her shriek would be heard by no one. For the estate stands miles from anyone wishing to hear. No doubt she would take to the door to look for the strange traveller who had seemingly betrayed them. Yet she would not find him

The children always ask why they cannot play, and the man with the fiddle. 

Somebody once said that they knew a girl who didn’t listen. She went through the woods late one night; she had plans to meet a boy on the opposite side.  The boy waited all night

They say that the girl never made it because she ran into the man with the fiddle. It’s said that she walked through the woods like she normally would, “what would you like to hear,” and then she noticed that there was a man sitting on a small stool with his back to her. She cried out to him, “I don’t know where I am,” but he ignored her and repeated, “what do you want to hear.”  The girl started to tremble in fear realizing what she’d done, it was the witching hour and she was alone. 

The girl took off with great swiftness

“That was very rude of you,” he asked this and looking up at her finally she looked helplessly into his shockingly white eyes and she couldn’t move.  “I know what you want to hear,” he said with a small laugh, and he raised his fiddle and bow. 

No one had heard from the girl for two weeks, iris and sclera, black. She was screaming, about a song. There was a song playing in her head and she couldn’t get  it out. The hunter tried to calm her but she fought him off, still screaming about a song. She moved with swiftness and grabbed the hunter’s gun, and before he could shout one bit of protest she had the gun to her head and fired. 

During the full moon it’s said that the man can draw you in. There is a story that once he drew in two young lovers. 

“Ahh

The woman spoke up first

“You are in heaven my dear. Yes

The man was just about to speak when the old man started to speak again

A month later they were found. The couple was bone thin, we’re only dancing,” they said in unison. 

Sometimes if you’re lucky, you can go into the woods and they are still dancing.  People argue that they are dead, have been dead since the night they got lured in, and other  say they are alive, and they are doomed to be alive, forever, forever dancing. 

Fools, and they say there is no man, but all those who have seen the man have never lived to tell, except for one. There were two friends who were stalking a deer to try to get a meal  to settle their empty stomachs when they was caught by the man with the fiddle. 

“Hello

“Whose there

“What would you like to hear?” 

“Who are you? Are you the devil?” asked the second
 
“The devil? What is the devil?” 

The two did something no one else had thought to do

Neither of them heard or seen the man move, “you called me the devil.”
 
“I- I’m sorry. Please let us go

“I play songs

“Can you play anything?”

“Anything you wish.” 

“There is this song my wife would sing before she died

The little fiddler stood there silently,” and sat down in the stool which seemed to materialize out of no where. Then when the little fiddler raised his bow and fiddle, some of the fog gathered itself and a ghost appeared. The ghost was a translucent form of a woman with large eyes and long hair. The man cried out to it, “Ramona.” 

“You asked for your wife’s song

The man walked up to his wife’s ghost and held out his hand for her. When she took it though the fog gathered around him and he began to dissolve, but the fiddler told him to go, he had nothing to play him, and so he went. But as he left he looked back and seen his friend had become a ghost, and he and his wife were dancing.

     In the beginning, animals, and humans. He thought ""Meh, it's cool I guess..."", and then he pretty much sat back and watched everything unfold, chillin' like a villain and taking many forms. Mostly though he liked to be a plastic dove. He saw all his creations screw up the world he created, and it pissed him off pretty badly. He thought for centuries about how he could save the world he put so little effort into creating.

     One day, but obviously a believer. One of them a natural born leader to guide the prophets. One of them tall and strong willed and convert others. One of them with great musical talents with which to sing and play instruments in the name of Dave, and the last one. Dave's only son. He arranged so that these men would one day come together and use their own talents to spread the word of Dave.

     These young men grew and realized their talents (except for the son of Dave, because they did not know that their destiny was the destiny that Dave set for them. They would know in the future that Dave needed them to rid the world of ignorance and stupidity. It would take time, though, for them to be ready for the task at hand.

     By the time these 5 young men were ready for their destiny, destruction in massive proportions. They were indeed ready at the last minute. The 5 boys had grown to be good friends, and were like family. One day, fate brought them all together, and set them on a journey that would open their eyes to the truth. Open their eyes to Dave. 

    They found themselves in their leader's house, economics, history, and other things of the like. Then, as fate may have it, they embarked on a journey. They started with a trip to a local general store to purchase liquid refreshment, and to win the heart of a fair maiden. They failed miserably at the winning the heart part

     They failed in their quest to acquire new trousers, a plastic bird, perched upon a raised surface. They were drawn to him, and immediately knew that it was to be theirs. They did not know why, but they knew it must be.

     They purchased the plastic bird, and that he was of great importance. The boys did not truly understand that Dave was of much more importance until much later. The day after their trip to the store, their land was ice-ridden. The plants outside were enveloped in a solid sheet of ice, and the roads were only traversible by foot, because none of their automobiles were equipped to operate on the ice-covered roads.

     The young men grew hungry, which they still failed to recognize, decided to embark on a long journey to obtain cheap, delicious food. They left their home and started down the road, talking and laughing, unaware of the great events that awaited them. They would soon find out the true purpose of what was happening.

     They noticed a bird that looked exactly like their plastic bird that was perched upon a telephone wire. Then they realized that this, but in the form of a living version of it's plastic form, guarding them, and guiding them. They then began to realize that they had a greater purpose in this journey, and that Dave was more than a mere plastic bird.

     They began to have revelations and realizations that Dave placed in their minds. They came to the conclusion that Dave was the true God, because of the hardships he faced and trials and tribulations. They realized that since he had no talent to offer Dave, he didn't require one, because him simply being among the other prophets was enough to please Dave.

     Then came their true sign that they were led by The Great and Powerful Dave. They noticed on the side of the path a beautiful sight. A useless, beautiful sight. They knew in their hearts that Dave put this there for them, that he loved them, and that he wanted them to cleanse the world of the wrongness that had befallen it.",,False,,False,t3_17b03s

Alex had a dream he will never forget. The dream was of him and his friend Jake lying in bed naked

*""I love you
Alex responds as he's tightly holding Jake 
*""Don't let me go
Jake whispers back 
*""I won't... I'll hold you and keep you warm until the Sun comes""* Alex leans in as he says 
*""Jake...""* 
Their faces coming closer to each other like magnets. Their mouths about to touch... 

But then Alex woke up to the sound of his alarm clock. Confused as to what he just experienced

Alex eventually shock it off as best as he could and went to get dressed for school. He caught the bus listening to one of his friend's song that he promised to listen to and tell her what he thought. 

""... Wow

*""... I'll hold you and keep you warm until the Sun rises...""*

The dream came back to Alex. Every last detail of it. Alex was hit by so many emotions at once it was hard trying to see how he could react to it. But, asked where Jake is. Alex replied,

""Oh

""What the fuck? And the school let him? That's so unfair! I tell the school I'm sick and they won't let me go

""Well

The whole day seemed so long

*""Come to my house
Alex texted back 
*""Sure
*""I don't think I should tell you through text""*
*""At least give a hint""*
*""Haha no.""*
*""Damn you
*""Thanks


Alex got to Jake's house at around 5 and he knocked on the door. The door answered to Jake.

""Hey man
""Just fine

""... You alright
""Yeah
""Oh
""So you're alone then. Nice.""
They both laughed and walked into the house and Alex told Jake about how pissed Jordan was about the situation. They both went up into Jake's room. And then Alex asked ""Anyway

""Oh... yeah..."" Jake's face grew with anxiety.
""I had a dream last night...""
Alex chuckled. ""Yes
""Shut up."" Jake responded and they both laughed.
""This dream was... unique.""
""How so?"" Alex responded.
""Okay

""What?"" Jake whispered. ""Oh man
""I mean it wasn't exactly that
They were looking into each other's eyes for a bit
""Yeah... o- of course it was..."" Jake said.
""I mean

Jake grabbed Alex's hand and the two ran to his room and jumped on his bed. The two fell onto the bed and they kissed each other again with the same passion, but I couldn't do it."" Then Jake started kissing Alex's neck. Alex whispered ""I've liked you too, but I couldn't admit to myself."" Jake's kiss moved from his neck to his chest, undoing Alex's belt and throwing it aside, his pants along with it. Alex slowly pulled down his boxers and pulled out his hard penis. Jake looked at Alex with a lustful smile and kissed him again. Jake did the same, but practically tore off his clothes. Jake took out a condom from his wallet that was on the floor and put it on while kissing Alex's neck. He rolled it on and Alex spread his legs very eagerly. Jake slowly put it in him. Alex moans because this is the first time he had anything like this, but it felt so good to him. He felt this warm sensation in his stomach. It felt like he was completed, Alex came allover himself and a little of it on Jake

Jake finally came and the two stayed in silence embracing the experience of each other's warmth. Jack eventually rolled off Alex and the two started cuddling and their legs wrapped together with Alex lying on Jake's chest. They laid there for a very long time until Alex looked up at Jake and said ""Looks like those dreams did mean something after all"" They both smiled at each other. ""Wait

""Oh.. um 9.""
""What time is it now?""

Jake checked his phone and it read ""8:59"". The two jumped up and rushed to get their clothes back on and get themselves organised before Jake's parents and grandparents get home. The two were in such a rush, they both smiled and Alex ran with a gleaming smile on his face. When he got home, his parents were having dinner

""Oh
""He's fine."" Alex replied without realising he still had that gleaming smile on his face.

""You look happy

Alex's smile grew bigger as he replied

The soldier slowly awoke to the sound of rain tapping out Morse code on his windowpane. Amid the murmuring drumming he lay already defeated, whilst the soldier’s bed and a few old boxes scattered throughout the room provided the only real decoration. 


The doctors had urged sunlight, that he should feel sheltered and secure near the window rather than the imprisonment he oft complained of. To the soldier it was all white wet noise, unrelenting and monotonous. With great effort he shifted on his shoulder to see the clock just tick to six, his hand reached for the bell beside the bed but he knew it was far too early to wake Jenny. Just as the young man was about to fall back into sleep, a brief cry escaped down below from the beach outside. 

The sea view from the back of the house had been the main reason they had bought the place

2.

When the two of them had climbed the ladder to the attic with a few other newlyweds all those years ago, with rows upon rows of bookcases encircling the high white walls. Now his books collected in various corners, falling out of cardboard boxes that flaked from the moisture of the mostly empty room. The window itself was enormous with a cross work of black mesh on the pane shaping the various frames within it. It took up much of the attic wall, almost doing justice in its size to the sea that unfurled out before it. Though he was physically fine to write after the assault in France, the desk was never bought, all his previous passion for Literature seemingly seeping away upon his return to Jenny and the house. 

As soon as the soldier found the source of the yelp, one fairly young standing beside what seemed to be merely the head of the other submerged in the sand. The children appeared to be chatting amiably, though the boom of the surging surf behind them smothered anything said. The soldier soon smiled however as he noticed it was merely the angle of the window lattice from where he was looking out that had suggested a severed head on account of the boy. It seemed the child was just standing in a dug hole, one that looked surprisingly deep and wide as the tall child climbed out unaided with much effort amid the moistening sand. 

The downpour was growing heavier now and the boys appeared to the soldier from above, stopping every now and then for a breath of two. It took a few minutes of surveillance but the soldier realized that he had seen them a few times around the town, two brothers. Before his view of the siblings, thick droplets were now amassing quickly on the pane. Rarely was the rain this insistent or obscuring. 

They were always together in his mind; an image in particular of them sharing a single ice cream before one of the town square storefronts struck him as oddly memorable. Most vividly however he recalled their rowdiness at the parade for the departing soldiers that had been held almost a year before. Amongst the bulging crowd they charged and darted with no concern but that the other not get ahead, but they were too liquid. This was before the rain came and the small square was unfittingly beautiful that day. Near everyone in the town crowded all around as convoys of men waved uncertain goodbyes to people they had only really considered background. After the last truck disappeared beyond the beachhead, Jenny had helped him walk away from the crowd and argued that the boys were too young to understand the prescience of what was happening, that they meant no disrespect. The soldier snapped back quickly however that a Second World War was something to be respected universally, regardless of age. 

3.

Turning his head for but a second to check the time again he found the children down below had disappeared from view. The void in the sand remained but even that was vanishing before his eyes as giant dewdrops splattered onto the window, practically smothering the window into a thick fog. The soldier could make out little but it seemed the boys had returned carrying a small body between them. Two clearly defined legs lifelessly dangled between the young carriers. 

The soldier simply didn’t think in that moment. Didn’t dwell upon what they might be being buried, but the boys clearly heard something and scurried away with their secret. The soldier waited, starting for a few seconds at the open grave and the waves behind gesturing forward. 

It seemed that the rain on the window however had led to misinterpretation; it was a dog they were carrying between them. Its tongue hung lifeless from its mouth; from high up he found it difficult to determine exactly what was wrong with it, gaze never from the void. The smaller child turned around and looked directly at the soldier for a few seconds without even realizing, the rain so driving now that he squinted when looking away. 

Dogs had grown rare around the town since the departing parade, or maybe they had merely discovered it in this condition and wished better for it than to merely be slumped in some passageway. The answers he would never really know, and oddly felt no real need to as he watched them fill the grave slowly with the shovels in hand. 

With the grave filled the two walked slowly towards the sea

She says this to herself
""Definitely."" She says again. Sighs and puts her head in her hands.
""My hands even smell like gerbil."" Her voice comes out muffled from between her fingers.
The cage is made of plastic. The top half clear, the home of Lisbeth - one of the more recent additions. It was my turn to pick a name so I went with a character from the book I was reading at the time.

Claire looks pained which surprises me. Lisbeth was her least favourite from the last litter
""We're out?""
""We're out."" I thought so anyway

Perdidazine is our drug of choice at the moment. Cheap blue and off-white capsules that can be ordered online with no hassle. A stimulant - it took us a while to decide - with some hallucinogenic properties. The unpleasant effects: skull-splitting headaches accompanied by a whirring noise that comes from inside your head. I usually picture a chainsaw slicing into my brain during this. Claire sometimes gets heart palpitations. Short term memory loss too; which isn't unpleasant in itself but makes life a bit more complicated and disorganised. The positives include time speeding up and these long, and confidence. If we were ever inclined to leave the house while high, we'd be social chameleons, knowing just what to be and when to be it.
Claire's face is haunted now, bored of this headache, bored of Claire's complaining even before she's started. I need to be in my room for a while.

I spent most of the next day watching my ceiling from my bed, just standard goldfish. I don't really care about them but whenever they die I replace them and keep the names. I feed them and change their water regularly, but every few months they die anyway. I go back to watching the ceiling. The palm on my right hand is scratched, which I probably did in my sleep. It hurts. It's annoying.

Claire comes in for a while and talks at me. Asks me if I ordered more perd. I tell her to fuck off. She watches the fish for a while with me

She wakes me up at seven in the morning. Her eyes are puffy from crying, the bookshelf, we look in the garden too although we're certain we never left the back door open. We give up the search. Probably for good this time. After dumping more food in all the occupied cages we watch daytime television until I fall asleep on the sofa.

Sometime after waking up again I feel like writing in my diary which I haven't done for at least a month. It's in the middle of my bookcase, feelings, activities, things it might be nice to remember at some point. Even Lisbeth gets a mention. I go to Claire's room and try to shake her awake but she's either been at Dad's diazepam or something else that she hasn't bothered to share with me - and won't be waking up for a while. I smoke the rest of the joint I found out of her window, poke a couple of her cuddly toys then leave. I find the camcorder cable in my desk and start recharging it. I'd assumed the battery was dead, and was right. I decide to film my fish swimming for a few hours because I'm not going to buy any more if they die on me again. I write 'Film them' on a piece of paper torn from a notepad and sellotape it to their tank.

I was woken up by the camcorder beeping. Means it's recharged. I go back to sleep.

When I get up none of my cereal is in the cereal cupboard which really annoys me. I have a cigarette in the garden and take one of two perd. capsules I have in my desk drawer  I ring dad who claims he bought it, or maybe for not finding her. She screams at me to fuck off. After a few minutes sat at the dining table I go and look in the same cupboard. It was next to the crunchy nut but at an angle that made it impossible to see. I pour myself a bowl, pour milk on, take one mouthful and realise I'm not even a bit hungry. I spit it out of the window.

When I go to feed my fish one of them is dead. She gets flushed down the toilet after I slightly mummify her in wet toilet paper to make sure she goes down properly. There's also a bit of scrap paper stuck on to the tank which says 'film them'. My handwriting. I rip it off and go tell Claire if she goes and buys me another goldfish I'll order more perdidazine. She agrees on the condition that I take pictures of the latest batch of gerbils and write up an advert on gumtree to sell them. Deal. I look for my phone but can't find it

The camcorder belonged to dad before I asked for it. I found it in the cellar. I was bored at the time and was getting stoned every day
He didn't.

I type out the advert. Gerbils
As I'm taking the camcorder downstairs I start to wonder how I'll get the photos online - the camcorder predates USB ports- but I'll deal with that later.  I want to see if there's anything left of the beach ball video first
After watching for a few minutes I turn it off, or otherwise gone.

I stay in my room for some time with one fish and a chainsaw headache.
Claire isn't in her room although her window's open. I throw the camcorder onto her bed with a note on it saying 'Watch this' I smoke a cigarette out of her window before deciding to pour out my last capsule and snort the contents. The last pill isn't in my desk though, but not bad.

Halfway down the stairs i stop, whatever she wants, if we had a beach ball we could go in the garden and play volleyball with it, or something. Anything she wants to do really. But she isn't in her room, although the window's open. My camcorder is on her bed with a note attached. I take it back to my room and put it on my bookshelf where it belongs.

My room. The camcorder is on my lap. On my desk, revving. Claire is next to me, watching the camcorder with me.
The room full of old people are laughing, and I'm about to fast foward when it begins and the view changes to a lopsided view of my bed, desk, and fish tank - a bookcases-eye-view. My voice can be heard from outside in the hall, muffled. It's my second time watching this and Claire's first but honestly, my recollection is hazy. It's mostly new to us both.

On the screen I walk in holding Lisbeth the gerbil by the base of her tail. I see myself look just to the left of the lens, some feature of my eyes are lost. Especially compared with Lisbeth's which are very much alive, big, black, and frightened. her paws are flapping at nothing, there's nothing to cling onto for her. We watch me make a fist around her, open the aquarium lid with my other hand and plunge her in. In the now Claire has started to scream at me

I tell her to shut up but she doesn't until she appears on screen and I grab her face and twist her at the screen so she sees herself. On screen, but she plunges in her own arm, coiled around mine like a snake, and puts her hand over my closed fist.

One or both of us is squeezing. Because red ribbons of blood are starting to trail upwards from between our fingers. She puts her other hand on my waist and slowly moves it up and down, in a way few people have touched me and in a way my sister never has. We're both grinning now, but the smiles seem painted on. It's not something that feels real. I can't see our eyes, but I know how blank and devoid of anything they are, I just know. More crimson streams waft out of our interlocked hands, and the fish swim strictly in the corner of their tank, well away from us.

At this point Claire runs from the room. I watch for another few minutes before turning it off.
I knock on her door but she just starts to scream at me again. I shout over her that we need more perd. and she gets louder

I listen to Pearl Jam's Lost Dogs with the volume quite low so I can hear if the letterbox is rattled and when it is
""Maybe in an hour or two we could look for Lisbeth again
She pauses
""Maybe try the study again?"" She stops again.
""And we could change her bedding so it's nice for her when we find her."" She does look up at me this time

""My Day called Regrets""

The year is 2013

It is a cold winters day

As I wonder why I still get up

I gather my things and head off to my third shift factory job and get ready for another slow night of work knowing the only things my mind will be thinking of are the things I wish it didn't. I put on a show for my co-workers, thinking, feeling pain I wish I have never felt. 

The time is 5am and it is almost time to get done with work. The thought of sleep seems so good, and machines. I kick off my boots knowing that the day is done and I can try and relax. Relaxation is just a distant memory I have not felt in a long time. It hurts. Everytihng hurts. I hate my job and the place I live. But I can not just leave and walk away. My gloves and heavy jacket help me get past the cold winter morning as I walk to my car.

1357493309.0,162g1r,Story I wrote in school: Splitting Wood. Tell me what you think. Enjoy. ,toteskrotzkrotz,5,2,3,"An autumn tapestry lies before me. I approach this landscape of fading greens
	Rays of glistening sunlight peek through the cloak of powdery overcast. There's no happy medium of temperature; heat exists in the light, follows along edge of a strong string of intersecting pines. At a point where the pines meet the path, an opening is made. The path continues past the aperture into a wide pasturage littered with goldenrod and burdock. The breeze picks up the goldenrod pollen and sends it dancing, twirling, twisting, and then off into the world. 
	The path continues along, but that’s as much as I know about them. I was back here last week, so the wood splitter is still here, but I didn't get much done. I have a problem with paying attention to what I'm doing. I'd like to say that it's nature's fault for being so damn beautiful, but I don't feel that way. I would just rather be somewhere else, although, I do like staring vacantly at the sky. Ever changing clouds distract me as they perform their celestial puppet shows. Above me, the clouds dance and move; their movements close to identical
	A nearby branch begins to shake, my attention is drawn. The rustling persists until a dry, crispy, brown leaf falls from branch, revealing a bluejay. The bird’s crested head tilts as it stares at me; we both stand motionless, staring at each other and waiting for the other’s reaction. His beaded eyes begin to widen and narrow and his talons wrap around the thin maple branch. A sudden flap of his sky blue wings sends the garrulous bird flying into the cold air and beyond.
	I turn back to my chore. The wood’s already cut into identical logs, creating a mass of haze that fogs my glasses. 
	The wood screeches and cries as it’s forcibly divided, their fibers held together tighter than others. The splitter snaps them regardless, only pausing momentarily while I provide it with more. Each piece is harder than the last. My muscles stretch with each lift, leaving them exhausted and drained. The sun position, directly above me, tells me it’s time for a well deserved break. 
	I sit my weary body on top a fallen poplar, comparable to a Mozartian piece, flutter down from the heavenly scene of altocumulus overcast. Ruby-throated hummingbirds weave their way in between the flying group of warblers, their wings flittering at magnificent speeds. I look in awe while chewing my slightly stale tuna fish sandwich. The moment the birds make their way behind the tall pines, and out of my sight, I finish it and walk back.
	The rather large pile of logs that once lay next to the splitter is gone and in its place are small remnants. The final cry of cracking wood echoes through the dense forest, the squelching sod, and the weaving winds. The rays that once cut through the clouds, now tries to make its way past the trees as its source begins to set. As the sun’s stream of shine loosens its grip on the land, the temperature drops. The once-subtle amount of fog left by my breath looks like smoke. I childishly hold my fingers up to my mouth and blow the smoke left in my lungs from my imaginary cigarette.

A crazed and bedraggled old man shuffled up to Lucius

“Pardon?” Lucius answered

“The alignment has begun! Those in rags shall be saved

The man began to shriek, or “civilization” as he called it, in no time.

Lucius woke up and lazily pawed through his smartphone’s news app.  It was the usual mix of tragedy in the Middle East and governmental incompetence at home. But something caught his eye.

“Reports are surfacing that the King of Tonga

*Kings shall be overthrown…*

A coincidence

“Tonga…” he said aloud.

*The riches of nations will turn to ruin…*

Another coincidence

Lucius strolled through the marble and glass hallways of his building

Life was good. 

Until the phone rang.

“Mr Green, and therefore you will not be able to use any of your assets”

The man down the line had a grey

Lucius slowly put down the phone.

*The riches of nations will turn to ruin….*

Did the old man have a point?

Brother Capital…

“Don’t be such a bloody fool!” Lucius barked at himself. Today was one of those days better spent on the deck of your yacht.

He was just unlucky that his account got frozen because of some political unrest in some unfathomably hot corner of the world… was he? He shook his head and turned on Bloomberg.

The colour red hit him first. Red arrows, trying to keep up with collapsing stocks across the world. NASDAQ, FTSE, DAX… all plummeting. 

A single bead of sweat rolled down Lucius’ face. This was terminal. He had £60 million invested across the world

Was there a way out?

*Those in rags shall be saved…*

*The riches of nations will turn to ruin…*

“He was right!”  “He was right!” Lucius sprinted out of the room

“Save yourself! For the day of the brother is upon us!”

He was at once accosted by an angry taxi driver.

I see our house, “She no longer loves us kids.” They run to her asking her to stay but she shakes her head ‘no’ and begins to leave. That’s when it happens.

The world that I and she made begins to fade away I see the walls disappearing.  I hold my children in my arms saying, don’t worry daddy is going to fix this.” I begin to cry even more knowing there’s nothing I can do to stop this. Our world is nearly gone all that’s left is the house, already half of the house is gone, the area around us is starting to fade. I kiss my children as they begin to fade, the whole time I’m staring into her eyes, she only sheds a tear as our children disappear. When I no longer feel them I feel another wave of tears wash over me as I get up in a rage yelling, “You heartless bastard how could you? Our kids are gone because of you!! All because it became to challenging for you??” I back away

She then dries up her tear and leaves threw the door as I hold the only remaining evidence of what I use to have. The photo is the best one of my no longer family. I cry deeply tracing the images of my family. Sebastian is the first to start fading; I start to cry even more as I lose memory of him, my wife. I don’t recall the feelings as she began to fade all I could remember was when she was mine. The photo now contains just me I cry as I try to remember my family but can’t.  I scream out in pain and agony, “YOU HEARTLESS MONSTER!!!!!” I then fall back down and lay there as I try to remember my family, all I can recall is the feelings I thought I had for…..her. The door she left in disappears as well. I just lay there, a shell of the man I once was.

1356786333.0,15mfxc,Torment,michaeldross,6,3,0,"My name is Jake Gillmore. Up until that devastating day that ruined my life

I worked for a frieghter company called Lightspeed. They ship anything, drivin' a hoverlift; loadin' the pallet's and other cargo into the transport ship's. Not my job of choice, but it paid the bill's.

The only ray's of sunshine in my life were my Wife and our Son... Those are good memories. My wife Lana, eye's as blue as ice and her lip's are beautifully full and alive. She was my one true love. Then my son, John was born and suddenly I had two great loves in my life. The last time I saw him he was eleven. Like me, he was not an athlete, but a thinker. A good strong jaw, and developing those ruggedly good look's like his old man. He'll have to beat the girl's off with a stick.

Hopefully he'll take my advice and wait till he's grown up and spent some time for himself travelin' and explorin' before he start's the dating game.

Listen to me. I'm dronin' on and on

What was the tragic twist of fate that ruined my life? It was a year ago, I was finishin' up loadin' a ship with produce. Much to my surprise Lana and John stopped by for a surprise visit. Out of the shadow's of another ship, a Terian stowaway emerge's and hold's my wife up at gun point in full view of me. Big mistake!

Wavin' that gun at my family. Terians aren't the brightess bunch in the galaxy. Ugly, and I'd gladly kill him again, to protect my family.

That's right. I killed him. When I saw him and his gun, and a life shattered.

The case was open and shut in no time. My sentence a lifetime banishment to the horrible planet known as Torment.

Torment... That's a fitting name for this place. When it's day time the temperature reaches the hundreds, escape from the light is impossible. Then the night is the same extreme. No visible moon or starlight. 

Don't ask me how

The planet is sandy

The only thing that's helped me to stay sane

Another blistering day on torment. Today, bubbling and has a hint of vanilla. Oddly the water is as cold as ice, even though it bubbles. Now if I only cared for vanilla, yuck.

The other day I spotted a Leeug. That's a creature about the size of a lion, but it crawl's like a slug. Even worse it has four tentacle arm's with claw's on each end. It was disturbingly close yesterday, so I'm obviously a little on edge today.

It's a little suspicious to me that I even spotted it

Now that I think about it I wonder why

Anyway I went for a swim and let down my guard as I began to relax. Idiot. When I came out of the water I caught a glimmer of a silhouette

I rushed the creature (a Leeug it turned out to be) and in it's shocked state I connected with a right. Then a left. It tried to bite my hand

Just as I caught my balance

I now know that the Leeug has a numbing poison on it's claw's

In the absence of pain my body surged out adrenaline and I used it to wrestle one of the Leeug's claws into my hand, and until I could feel the solid thump of stabbing terrain beneath it.

After my victory I crawled towards the sound of the bubbling water

Feeling slightly dizzy I placed the Leeug claw in my rear pocket

After an hour I began to worry. I had walked from the water hole to my camp at night many times. Half of the time I did it without a flash light, I came to a tree and found the arrow I carved into it to help me along my path at night. I also numbered them, and this one was number three. I was close!

Then I heard it. Several grunt's in different directions. The Leeug's were upon me. I guess they travel in pack's and the one I killed was just the tip of the iceberg.

I drew the claw from my pocket and began slashing in the air wildly in all directions. I knew that my effort's were in vain. I was no doubt doomed!

My name is Lana Gillmore. My husband Jake saved me and our son John over a year ago from a Terian mugger. 

In the confusion of the fight the mugger shot himself

Even now, muttering to himself in unintelligible whispers. He wear's a straight-jacket and requires constant care. Maybe somday he'll come to term's with what happened.

Maybe someday.

Grocery stores bagged our groceries in brown paper bags, was the use of brown paper bags as book covers for our schoolbooks. This was to ensure that public property, (the books provided for our use by the school) was not defaced by our scribblings. Then we were able to personalize our books on the brown paper bags.

In the kitchen, we blended and stirred by hand because we didn't have electric machines to do everything for us. When we packaged a fragile item to send in the mail, we used wadded up old newspapers to cushion it, not Styrofoam or plastic bubble wrap. Back then, we didn't fire up an engine and burn gasoline just to cut the lawn. We used a push mower that ran on human power. We exercised by working so we didn't need to go to a health club to run on treadmills that operate on electricity.
But she's right; we didn't have the green thing back then.
We drank from a fountain when we were thirsty instead of using a cup or a plastic bottle every time we had a drink of water. We refilled writing pens with ink instead of buying a new pen

	“Dude,” They were cousins, and best friends, and only Gitch’s persistence and energy could make him get out of bed by shaking him, Gitch was an early riser, always at seven. “C’mon, grandma made eggs and hash browns, he finally began to move, Cameron sat for a second on the end before getting up off his bed
	
Gitch led the way through the hallway, bumping and falling constantly but never crying. Tall and skinny Dillon was replacing the batteries in the smoke detector as the graying cloud thickened around him, “We’ll kick ass today, yaw?”, smacked his two cousins in the shoulder and laughed as he pointed into the washroom. Nikki, the half Indian cousin but still retaining the same smile they all had, was patting Sam on the back as she cried with her newly discovered makeup running down her face sitting on the toilet about her boyfriend of two weeks who had broken up with her.

“Its ok, besides,” Nikki said sighing, Sam looked up at her. “Relax, you’re only 13.” The words seemed to hit Sam with such power that she stood defiantly and looked at her younger cousin’s in the face, suddenly not in tears.

“I’m going to get chocolate.” Swinging her hair around and strutting

“Hey

“I’m not coming back! You just don’t understand!” Running up the stairs

“OY!” Plates being set on the table could be heard from the washroom and hall, who looked at each other confused at what had just happen, and went to the kitchen, but they didn’t see Dillon on the way.


The red walled kitchen was soon filled. A brown table was covered in platters of pancakes, holding a mug and puffing away, always poured Brett, the youngest, juice first and then started throwing food onto all the kid’s plates. They all chewed hungrily as their grandma, who was beautiful and a model once, stood leaning tiredly on the counter

“AHHH!” Schrieking as Dillon came running into the kitchen

“Why?” Dillon reached into the bucket he ran in with, all the cousins cheering him on.
“Just give it a little touch!” Running and chasing her

There was always competition to that could get the best catch of critter at the cottage. Dillon, catching lizards, frogs, giant fish, even squirrels. The real winner was who could scare their grandma the most; she was scared of most critters, she never got too angry though. Pulling out a white toad, the cousins sang their “ouuuh’s” and “ahh’s” together. They all become excited when it came to catching critters and at their cottage their grandpa had built to be off the grids.

The cottage was the favorite place when anyone went up. When grandpa was building it, more ridiculous. He did always say it was his true passion, his cottage more extravagant than any of the family’s houses. Without saying much he just wanted the cottage to be a paradise, and it really was to those who visited.
 
	The actually cottage was at the very end of the very last road. On a five-acre square property in the corner of the lake. Inside was just a giant living room and a high ceiling with a moonlight cluttered with comfy couches, and the rest of the rooms are simple bedrooms and bathrooms. He added windmills, solar panels and water filters, it even had it’s own waste treatment process underground. The garden wasn’t used to grow food but large flowers, but it could grow enough vegetables to live on. All the sliding doors including the kitchen’s go to the patio with the giant barbeque that overlooks the entire lake and is right smack in front of the orange and purple sunset in the summer. The boat is raised on the dock and the dock goes 30 feet into the water, with a diving board on the end. To the right is a white-sanded beach with a trampoline and a homemade jungle gym with its own slide, monkey bars and jump platform, as a field for bacci, with trails of rock which leave you knee high in water to walk through the swamp and catch the critters, to be shared when they all turned to adults.

After Dillon had convinced grandma that it was safe to come back the kitchen and given Cameron the frog, going outside together first.

“Phew, where most of the family was. Dragonflies hummed around, large enough to eat, the cat was driving himself crazy running around the brown wooden patio, just not fast enough to snatch one. They headed quickly together to the beach, going down the old concrete steps with moss on them.
“We should practice for today!” Grabbing two nearby bamboo nets

They ran together towards the swamp, they scared off the frogs and left the toad sitting confused in his new home.
“Frogs are too hard to catch this year, he swiped at a frog, only to have it jump away at the last second. The water around them became dirty and they, shirtless, moved on, becoming focused on the animals around them under the shining sun.
*	* 	*	*	*
“Boys!” Dillon yelled, he checked the stats.
“Dillon!” Laughing together, staring into it. “Look what we got!” Sloshing the bucket towards Dillon, he barely looked into it.
“C’mon let’s go!” He said sighing. “We’re going to be late! And then you cant-“
“Ok, jumping into the boat with Cameron.
The boys sat in the front, smaller cottage, which had dozens of boats surrounding it. Slowing down, Cameron and Gitch noticed it was mostly teenagers, like Dillon, being loud and running around each other.
“Listen, we have to beat everyone else, and winner gets a free case of beer.”  	
Looking up at the beach
“CINDY!?” Gitch yelled
“SHH!” Smacking Gitch on the arm
Walking behind their older cousin, all half-dressed and stumbling. Music they weren’t allowed to listen to was blasting, and bodies thrust into each other.
They lost Dillon for a while and ended up next to the porta potties, Dillon came staggering towards them.
“All right, and looked around, probably for Cindy.
 “EVERYONE!” A fat teenager stepped on a barrel,” he said, looking around. “Welcome to this year’s Regatta Bash!” Cheers erupted and people jumped up and down. Waving his hands, the crowd settled again. “There’s three competitions this year,” Holding silence for effect. “Flip cup, wakeboarding, and critter catching.” Cameron and Gitch grinned at eachother, but needed the boys to really win the competition. 
“Ok, have, I mean have to catch something. There’s only sex, I mean six others in your competition.” Standing to his full height, he clapped both boys on their shoulders. “Do me proud cuzzies.” And he walked off, surprisingly straight, to the flip cup table.
“Anyone who’s catching stuff
Cameron and Gitch sped off, dirty as it was. Formulating a plan, they decided to walk down the coast, to find a nook where they could hopefully find a turtle or snake. Making no progress for the first twenty minutes, not even spotting a fish, they became worried.
“This sucks!” Cameron threw his net into the water and huffed towards the short to sit down. “There’s nothing to catch
“Don’t move.” Gitch interrupted. He raised a finger to his lips and pointed with his net to behind Cameron. Without moving
There, solid green, it’s eyes looked like ping-pong balls. It hadn’t moved but it was so big they could see it breathing.
“Dude
It was easier then they thought possible
“THIS IS INSANE!” Gitch yelled
“YEAAHHHHHH!” Dillon screamed as he spotted his two cousins, smiling with a mouth full of dirt. “Guys, thanks! This, this, this is ridiculous!” He looked into the bucket. “That’s gotta be, Cindy!” Turning his head violently, he gestured for her to come
“Wow, but maybe it was because of the beer.
*	*	*	*	*
With Cindy in his lap and looking very pleased with himself, the ride back was pretty peaceful, with the sun going down on their backs, their cottage glowed.
Approaching the cottage, they started yelling, but their voices were lost in the wind.
“DIllON!” Gitch yelled in his ear, and they were headed right for the dock. The boat approached the dock quickly, and they all screamed together, but it bounced off the wood, only throwing their heads forwards.
“WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOUNG MAN!” Slipper in hand, only to be hugged tightly by their grandmother.
“Yeah,” Slurring his words, Dillon knew he was caught, and seemed to forget about Cindy, who looked equally as scared and disheveled. “I was stupid and wasn’t careful, I sorry, grandma.” Then he vomited all over the boat.

As he was walking across the road to the crossroads,and was affecting him more then ever before.He never told anyone about this though because he thought it was just his imagination running wild. At least thats what he thought any sane person would say.He decided to just ignore this feeling and rushed home to get out of the cold weather. He might as well as just stay in a freezer,at least it would be warmer then this. 

When he finally got home,which was also weird considering how overprotective she was off him. After a while he decided to call for her numerous times but had no reply. S he also didn't reply to any of his phone calls. He gave up after a while and started to play his xbox again,thinking she was just very busy.

 He turned the Xbox back on to kill of some time while waiting for his mum. At about 8pm Matt  started to get worried,she would never do anything like this on purpose,would she? Reluctantly he got the phone and gave her a voice message saying ""Mum if you hear this please reply,I'm worried.You haven't answered anything i sent you"",he then placed the phone down and tried to get to sleep hoping this was all a huge nightmare.

By the time he realized this, his eyesight began to fail, and the room began to diminish at its edges. Daniel closed his eyes, and found that they were much harder to open again.

Knowing he had a wife to go home to made everything worse when he looked at his friend. The crash had come out of nowhere. The hospital room was cold and dark. The doctor explained in cold terms and a colder tone what went wrong. Where the surgery failed to save her

“There was nothing we could do.”

His friend recoiled and sobbed as the doctor reached out to offer a consoling hand on the shoulder. The doctor retracted
He sat there. He stared into space. 

“What am I supposed to say to a man who has lost everything? Should I give condolences that will be lost to a sad revelation that no condolences will bring love back? Should I give apologies that a fateful heartless world snatched away the only thing he had left? Should I quote meaningless songs written for the masses to identify with? 

“What do you say to the man who has lost love? Nothing can console this loss. Nothing can console this fear. Nothing can console the understandable hatred of everything and overwhelming sense of decay and hopelessness. No one can fix this. Nothing will change what has happened.”
He sat in silence

“Move on.”

His friend looked at him shocked

“Nothing can change what has happened. No amount of obsession. No amount of remorse. No amount of fear, or company will ever fix this. No advice will heal your broken heart. 

“There is nothing anyone can do for you. This is a battle you have to fight alone. You have to understand that. The only thing you can do is stand up, you still have yours. As fucked up as this is: it was meant to happen. You have a life to live. Don’t waste it.”

With this he turned and left the room. His friend sobbing quietly in the background; the sobs grew softer as he walked away. Nothing could help his friend now. Only time would heal these wounds.

Months later, everyone was happy. A knock came on his door. He stood slowly and walked to the door. He opened it with deliberate purpose. 

He was greeted by a fist to his face. His friend stood at the door and offered him a hand to stand up. 
“You’re a dick. You didn’t save her. You weren’t there when I was in my darkest time, alone and broken.“

He breathed deep and his face relaxed. 

“But you did help me. You did what you needed to do. You pushed me to my own feet

An Afternoon In The Park
	
     There is an old man that everyday can be found on the same bench, he goes about his day and keeps to himself.
	It has been almost a year since his wife passed
“Tell me about mom.”
	The old man stops moving. He looks out to the horizon, “She was my heart and soul.” He maintained eye contact until he could no longer hide the weight of the tears that were beginning to form in his eyes. Even as a proud man he could not hide how much he truly missed his wife. Her death left him a hollow shell that could only continue on by maintaining the same mundane schedule.
	The son sat silently in a state of shocked disbelief. Throughout his life he thought he had seen every emotion possible from his father. Yet he had never seen grief such as this. When his father looked him in the eyes he could see an old lonely man. While the two had a loving relationship they had never really connected with each other. His father’s face displayed the many hardships and loss that go along with the happiness and joy in life. The youthfulness that he always attributed to his father had been replaced with a visage that resembled a young boy whose dog has ran away never to return. He wanted to lighten the mood so he tried to recall a happy family memory.
“Remember my first day of college and moving into the dorms? Remember how much mom embarrassed me by handing me a box of condoms in front of that big group of girls in the lobby?”
	Sitting on his left, but a single tear feel down the right side of the old man’s cheek as he relieved such a happy memory.

“Didn’t you and mom meet at state?” asked the son.

“Yep.” The old man replied.

“She always told me you went there to be with her and how romantic it was.”

“Nope

	This surprised the son. He had grown up with the idea that his parents met because his father went to State to be with his mother; if this wasn’t the case

“Didn’t you quit drinking for mom?”

“Nope

“What about your job? Wasn’t there a time you got offered a corporate position and you turned it down to start family?”

“Nope

	Frustrated

“What about all the money you worked for? The Corvette? The house you bought? Why you quit smoking and drinking?”

	With each question asked the old man would give the same response: “I did it for myself.” Fed up with getting nowhere the son stopped his inquiry, took a deep breath and replied:

“Everything else.”

	For the rest of the afternoon the two sat together in silence. For the first time in his life the son felt that he finally saw a glimpse of his father that he swore did not exist. The old man never made a claim toward achieving perfection in his life

It was a little past midnight (I think) when I headed towards the attic. Sleeping closest to the window was of course Catt. I thought back to when she asked if I needed some water. I didn’t realize it then, who simply took to asking questions like that simply because it seemed like the thing to do after an apocalypse of sorts. They were parrots, really. 


I whispered a goodbye and climbed out the window. It was worse than I thought. The smell was unbearable. A ghastly wind flowed through the empty streets. I dropped down to the ground floor and took a stroll towards Catt’s apartment


I started blacking out. I had no idea what I was doing or where I was going or why I even left. There really was nowhere else to go. I had to head back. Sure I would be back at the place I complained about without end, I was barely crawling.

Alyx Vance is one of the many leaders for the Resistance, and he was like a machine; kill one Combine, move seamlessly to a zombie, then straight to an Antlion. I wondered where he received his combat training, considering he used to be a scientist right out of MIT, maybe he used to be military, who knows? He never says anything. Ever. Anyway here I am, but I doubt he needs any help.
My name is Alexander Sauer; I joined the resistance about three years ago. When I was around twenty five, I swore to get my revenge, no matter what. I was contacted by the Resistance when Alyx Vance and Barney Calhoun were passing through City 7, they heard about the raid and said I could fight for the Resistance and get the Combine off of our planet. Naturally, I joined right away to get back at the Combine for what they did to my brother; I wouldn’t let them do this to anybody else.
So, looking for one scientist who is supposedly able to save the world.
What a rut I have gotten myself into.
I walked out of the abandon mineshaft that led straight from Black Mesa East to Ravenholm into an open grassy area boxed in by three or four buildings; it was hard to see in the dark. A small rustling sound came from my left. I swung my handgun up to meet the perpetrator, and then flew off into the night. “Strange.” I mumbled to myself. I started heading towards a small shack with a sickly yellow light radiating from it when I heard a second rustling sound behind me, this time much bigger. I brought my gun up again to defend myself from whatever was making the noise. I peered into the darkness with my gun drawn, but I couldn’t see anything. “Birds, I guess…” I put my gun back in its holster and turned around towards the shack when I bumped into a pair of dismembered legs hanging from a tree.
“Dritt!” I swore in Norwegian, falling down. My commotion had awakened a headcrab zombie from under the shack. I brought my gun up for a third time and put seven bullets in the things chest, which brought it down, but not for long. I made a b-line straight for the shack, leaping over the fallen monster and slamming the door behind me. I began taking mental inventory.
I shot seven rounds
After making sure I was prepared, I saw old saw blades, propane tanks, and 2x4’s lying around. I began to wonder why a workshop would need propane, when I was interrupted by the gurgling cry that signifies a headcrab zombie. In a room I hadn’t bothered to look in, there were four or five zombies shambling towards me, thankfully there were boards nailed to the doorframe, when I had an idea. I returned my pistol to its home on my belt, because there were scorch marks on the wall. I unloaded three rounds into the tank in the middle of the room, which was Resistance standard issue. That told me two things; that somebody had already been through here
It could be anybody’s magazine; it is what the Resistance gives out
I shook this thought from my head. If there was one thing I learned over the years it would be: don’t get your hopes up, perfectly fine and healthy, but that day never came.
After about three and a half hours of wandering around Ravenholm in the dark avoiding zombies and headcrabs alike, and air duct was filled with all kinds of baddies. I had to find somewhere safe. Thirty minutes later, I was still looking for somewhere to rest my eyes, when some yellow paint caught my eye. I made my way over to inspect the paint, and what I saw reassured me that I was on the right track.
What I saw was a spray paint lambda with a circle around it that signified a lambda cache. Lambda caches are small stores of weapons, it meant that I had somewhere safe for at least the night, and also that I could resupply my weapons. The only problem was that it was on a ledge about twelve feet off of the ground. I began to scan the surrounding area for ways to get my tired body up to this beacon of hope. I saw a ladder about five hundred meters away, but there was a large group of zombies surrounding it.
Up till now, so I chose the latter of the two options. I decided to not take any chances and use my submachine gun this time. I pulled it around on its sling, and levelled it with the first zombie’s head. I pulled the trigger in two short, controlled bursts, so that I could keep accurate, while still putting a fair amount of lead into the former-human’s head. The short, loud reports of my gun awakened the other zombies while the first one fell to the ground. I took them down, almost machine like. In a situation such as this, sons, lingering on this thought
I sprinted over to the ladder and climbed up onto the roof. I made my way, and almost nothing popped out to protest my progression. I had made it to the hatch right above the Cache; I scanned around to make sure nothing was watching me, and slipped in silently. The Cache was a small area of air duct that had been welded off from the rest of the system to preserve security. It was around five feet by five feet wide, and three feet tall. I looked around, and my heart sank. What I saw was a mattress, some tally marks on the wall, and empty ammunition cases. All the ammo had been taken! Somebody had made it here before me, I had around three clips for my handgun
I had almost fallen completely asleep, judging by the blood.
How had I not noticed that before? I need to keep my guard up
I began to reach for my pistol, but it would stop about a quarter of the way open. I tried to look for my handgun, but, still, it eluded my eyes. I began throwing my shoulder into the hatch, trying desperately to force it open. One, two, four. It my shirt ripped, making its signature gurgling cry to alert the other zombies. I threw my shoulder at the door once more, trying to put as much distance between me and the zombies. I came to an extremely high drop

   But today was not the day to hunt, but he knew his current cache wouldn’t last him the winter. He wanted at least another cord of oak to be sure he wouldn’t run out. He would spend his day cutting and pilling wood. 
   After George ate breakfast, that had been passed down from his father. He still remembered his father’s words when he presented it to him, “Son, one day this will save your life”. He brought the rifle out with him every time he went out, with those words echoing in his head. His father had definitely been right, the rifle had gotten him through many winters, and it had gotten him out some very close encounters with the wildlife. 
   George continued with his preparations, he opened his front door, and started towards the forest trail. He knew of an area with many large ash trees, but he knew carrying the wood back would be a pain. With the new snow, he couldn’t bring a wheelbarrow, and he didn’t have any other means of transporting the wood, except by hand. The trees were about a forty-five minute walk from his cabin
   An idea came to him, and a few meters of rope. After a few minutes, and some craftsmanship, George fashioned himself a kind of sled that he could carry the wood back with. He took a second to admire his own craftiness, grabbed the sled and started back for the path. 
   He could feel the .308 against his back, he didn’t hesitate for a second. He turned to his left and kept on going. He didn’t like travelling this path; he had had some bad experiences on it. More than a few close calls with wolves have taken place there, and whenever he walked it, he was always on his guard for another attack.  Something in the snow ahead of him caught his eye, and he knelt down to examine it. His heart sank when he realized it was a wolf track, a fresh one too. 
   He immediately went for his gun that was slung on his back. He loaded a bullet into the chamber, but did not lower his rifle. He heard the ruffling of leaves behind him, and he went to turn towards it. Without even realising it, he had placed his right foot on his sled. When he turned the sled gave out, and he fell violently towards the ground, letting go of his rifle at the same time. He hit the snow just an instant before the rifle, and he had just enough time to look into the barrel of the gun before it smashed against the ground

The foreboding presence of Tru-Valu Mart and its dirty parking lot is something I really don't. I end this train of thought right then and there because if i let my brain start to ponder duality then I will be in a funk all day, as if a surgeon did it. I'm nervous now, nothing coming to mind.

Have you not a single decent and then BAM! too late. I am inside heading towards the back. Another bad day begins.

I would normally spend some ludicrous amount of time fretting about how that doesn't make any sense but I feelo an ornate calmness, the sensation of figuring out exactly what would remedy your current situation. I open my glove box (I have never once stored any kind of gloves in there, I wonder why they call it that) and take out a fine permanent marker in black. I feel anxious again, dare I say even mosey on over to the bus stop. I stare at the make-up advertisement for a moment and take in everything I hate about it. How big it is, ready for its public. Nothing too drastic

It would be a nice day to read a good book by the fire. The cloud coverage gives the appearance of it being morning all day. I like this.

I had spilled salt onto the table and this time it was the last straw.
My face was red from embarrassment
under my left eye
My head was pounding and my whole body hurt.
It took every ounce of strength I had to climb the ladder
so I could obey the command “Get out of my fucking sight before I do something even worse.”
This wasn’t the first time he had hit me
This time I was lucky. 
I could wait a few days til the bruise turned a lighter shade of angry and cover it with thick makeup.
I’d wear sunglasses to cover the blood vessels that had burst in my eye.
I knew all the tricks to concealing the bruises
I invested in every cream on the market that claimed to rid your body of 
those unholy blemishes.
They half-assed worked on the smaller ones
while I washed the dishes had to always be cleverly covered by  a scarf
It reached from one shoulder to the other.
The doctor had a hard time stitching it up. 
The emergency room had heard every one of my excuses.
I could tell from the pity in the eyes of the nurses that they didn’t believe a damn word that I was spewing
but they couldn’t do anything about it since we were two consenting adults
Pressing charges only makes things worse.

It took me several minutes to will my muscles to move enough so I could get to the attic
which was my new “home” within my house.
I was banished here shortly after the honeymoon.
He couldn’t put up with me in bed
and he only ventured to my accommodations in order to satiate his primal “needs”.
I learned quickly not to resist and the proper noises to make at the proper times.
Even then
Surfacing through the hole in the ceiling to my bare furnishings took every ounce of strength that I had.
I had clawed my way up to what I thought was my temporary sanctuary only to find a noose hanging in place of my stuffed bear that sat in the corner on his little chair.
I choked back a sob.
Not for the sight of the noose
It had been my only friend and confidant. 
Now it was gone and I had nothing.
Was this the sign I had been begging for all of these years
I found myself drawn to this instrument of self destruction. 
It hung on a thick beam.
No one would ever know.
I had til five o’clock to decide my fate.
That’s when I had to begin preparations for his dinner.
I wasn’t allowed to eat with him.
I served him in the dining room and I ate in the kitchen.
I never feel like a wife
I reached for the rope that was tied into this sinister knot
It was sturdy.
I certainly weighed enough to commit this final act
Oh how tempting this was.
I wondered if it was his idea.
He would often bring drunk women into our “home” during the witching hours and expect me to undress them and have them waiting
he would please himself and them

The noose became more and more appealing as the clock ticked away minutes and seconds.
Minutes and seconds that I was wasting.
I needed to make a decision.
In my mind there were no cons and only pros.
I had no family that cared
Why not take my life into my own hands and end it before he had the pleasure of doing it?
My hand had not left the rope.
It was coarse and didn’t stretch.
It was perfect.
I could still hear him screaming downstairs in the dining room.
I never wished death upon him
Every time he beat me
I prayed he would plunge the knife a little deeper
hit me just hard enough
break my nose and shove cartilage into my brain
throw me down every flight of stairs in our house
or just shoot me.
He had threatened me with a gun seven times to date.
He wouldn’t have if he knew that it would have caused me immense pleasure to have a fatal entry and exit wound through my head.
He was a surgeon though and a sadist.
He knew exactly where to plunge the knife so it wouldn’t hit anything vital.
He knew where he could hit me to cause the most pain
He always missed me nose when he lunged for my face.
He knew at my stature and weight
He never kept bullets in his guns
He also didn’t know that I cleaned his guns better than he did
There’s not much to do when you’re left home alone all day.

The alarm clock on the floor next to my bed read 4:30 pm.
Had four and a half hours actually elapsed since that beating? 
My knees did hurt
My hand was red from handling the coarse rope.
The realization of the time had brought me back to my semblance of reality
and had given me the sense of urgency that I needed to formulate a plan.
It was now 4:35.
I would not go downstairs at five o’clock.
I would wait for him to come to me. 
He wasn’t going to win the game this time.
He was going to get his. 
I wasn’t going to hide my bruises or scars anymore.
I took my place on the chair where my bear had sat
It fit like a glove.
I steadied myself and waited.
The time dragged on.
I could hear every second pass.
I could feel every last minute slip through my fingers.
At five o’clock an alarm downstairs went off.
I was screamed for.
I was told to shut the damned thing off. 
It took two minutes and forty five seconds for him to turn it off himself
and to start his search for me.
I could hear him yelling for me in the kitchen.
Calling out what he didn’t know were going to be idle threats.
He went to his bedroom.
The bathrooms.
The dining room.
He screamed my name one last time before it occurred to him that I now slept in the attic.
I heard him approach and pull the string to the ladder to bring it down.
I heard him take his first step.
His second step.
His third step.
The abusive words grew louder with his approach.
His sixth step.
His seventh
There were 13 steps all together
and him being a tall “man” his head was about the attic floor
We locked eyes.
He stood paralyzed for a second then smirked.
He told me I didn’t have the guts.
He didn’t believe me even after I had jumped from the chair
crashing through the attic window and as the rope was severed by the force of my jump and the 
shattered glass

	This evening was not going as planned. The car would not even crank, so for the engine to quit on it now only made Jeremy Soben near next to furious. His anger only further fueled the abuse Jeremy laid out upon the spent motor. Each turn of the key was met with grinding under the hood and grinding of Jeremy’s patience with the damned car. He looked out his window at the blackness of this mid-October night and knew the cold he would feel as soon as he stepped outside to contemplate his car’s lassitude. He knew he should have worn another layer. 
	Never being much of a “car dude” in school, Jeremy pulls it only to find it has adjusted the steering column itself, not the hood. Damn it. Reaching back further, the tiny black pull-lever is latched onto and pulled quickly, making a resounded snap as it returned to its original position and a *click* as the hood pops. Jeremy makes his way around and takes a peek at the battery, shivering as he went.
	There was some corrosion around the positive and negative poles of the battery, forever possessing the top slot, and of that Jeremy was certain). Touching the name brought the dial tone to his ears in mere seconds and a tired, gruff voice half a minute later.
	“Thomas Arnold speaking
	“Hey Thom
	A few moments passed before, you mean the guy who picked up my car in, like, twenty minutes during rush hour? That would be…let’s see here…,” there was a pause on the other side of the line, “…here we go. ‘Maintenance and Tow’ is all I have in my phone for them. The number is 332-363-9464. I don’t know any people who have called them out at night, but if their daytime performance speaks for their night
	“Thanks
	“Maintenance and Tow” was one of those discount body repair places one would see commercials for all over local television at two or three in the morning. The big selling point, but “the savings of employment are passed on to YOU.” Not many people call them, as it turns out, since there should be, more likely than not, a long wait since it was just the one guy. Jerry could actually see the owner’s face in his mind’s eye from the commercial: long with an angled, clean-shaven chin; mostly bald but with buzzed
	Thinking that the wait couldn’t be very long, the other line clicked and a sleepy, gravelly voice answered, “Hel—,” cleared itself with a cough, “Hello?” this time a little clearer  and less grainy. “This is—,” another cough, the one and only Fredd Hattfield speaking. Are you in a safe place?”
	“Yeah
	“That the ‘Westington’ in Greendale
	“Oh, and I think I’m probably going to need a tow.”
	“Yeah, I don’t rightly know, about twenty minutes. You just sit tight, sir, and I’ll have you taken care of right quick. Just make certain you are there when I arrive.”
	Soben stowed his phone away in his pocket and reclined back in his chair, so the whole week around the two dates was special to them both: every meal each other’s favorites, every night filled with love and fun. Tonight was to be Jerry’s absolute favorite dinner: filet mignon, lobster tail with butter and lemon, and homemade mash with brown gravy. He had looked forward to it all day long, pushed through each hour at work and even skipped lunch so that dinner would be that much more sweet, and here he sat at eight at night, assuming this Fredd Hattfield would drop him off remotely close to home after this was all over and done with. This evening was not going as planned
	The fog was thick, but far from his sight, platonic forms hidden at the back of the mind but without physical body. His mind swam briefly and the long black train marched on without him. His eyes fluttered and he jumped awake, orbits wide and searching for a clock. 20:17. He’d only made the call fifteen minutes ago. He needed to call Ash, to tell her he would be late. Hopefully she wouldn’t be upset.
	As he pulled out his phone, a rap came a tapping on his car’s door. Startled, Jerry looked up and out his window, mind on high alert, only to find the long, bald head of Fredd Hattfield staring at him with a grin and smiling green eyes that should not be worn by any serviceman at any point in their life. Jerry rolled down his window, rubbing the remainder of his sleep from his red eyes. The man stood up straight, wearing a thick
	“Didn’t mean to startle you, in slow, calculated speech.
	“Oh, and yeah, I am. Getting ready to call my wife, actually, but I suppose it can wait now that you’re here,” was Soben’s still-sleepy response.
	“Sorry to disturbed you
	Nodding his head in permission, while Fredd wound his way around to the front of the small car and stuck his head under the already popped hood. Hattfield’s first thought was, naturally, to look at the battery, and he immediately spotted the white build-up around the positive and negative ends.
	“That junk right there needs to be cleaned off before we go any further, he would return in a second, Hattfield made his way, slowly, to his truck, picked up his trusty screwdriver (with the long neck to reach those hard-to-get places), some newspaper to lay down, Hattfield turned the device on and started to charge the battery.
	“While that charges, just in case.
	Jerry stood coldly by, be it towards a garage or his home. The cold clouded his mind in a way that sleep did, only in his case each amplified the other. He watched as Hattfield removed the bottom panel under the steering column with his long-ass screwdriver and started looking around with a small LED flashlight he pulled from his pocket, all the while “haroom-ing” and “humming.” After just a few minutes of looking and poking, Hattfield rose up a little to look at Soben and beckon him closer.
	You have a couple of wires that have come loose. Don’t know rightly how they could and you still drive around without the wheel lockin’ up on you
	They play a small game of tango as Hattfield attempts to wiggle around Soben so that one might occupy the other’s position. Finally, he spots the miscreant wiring, smiled big, and said, “Damned if you weren’t right.” He wore that smile until he looked back at Fredd Hatfield right as his screwdriver plunged into his left eye socket, the tip slipping through the serous liquid, breaking the bone at the back of the orbit and plunging into his grey matter.
Hattfield smiled as he felt the steel pierce the eye, he wiggled the tip around, ensuring the brain matter was effectively scrambled as he pushed his tool of pain deeper into the socket until finally the handle rested on the eye. Soben tried talking, screaming, anything, but nothing would come out…at least nothing intelligible. Good. He must have disabled, among many other things, he clasped his hands around his throat and squeezed until this unfortunate Mr. Soben’s face turned blue. The steely smell of blood hanging in the cab of the vehicle

It was brought in at the waist, further amplifying her figure. Looking down at herself, she could only smile and rub her stomach as she thought of the wonderful news she couldn't wait to share. She pulled out her chair, waiting for her lover as she watched the door in euphoric ecstasy of anticipation.

The only reason I woke was because of an unremembered dream which led me to seek my lost pillow for comfort. The only memory of this foggy dream was the sound of an ocean’s water sucking far away only to return in a crash. I needed something to hold onto but found nothing on my empty bed. Eventually I felt the old pillow I have used for so many years
	I couldn’t fall back asleep. It may have been the rain’s increasing tempo outside or the morning sun peeking into my bedside window. After lying there for about an hour, as if my house knew there was something ahead I should not come to. The carpet was pulling me down now, it wouldn’t allow me to walk any farther through my house, I needed to turn back; but when I did, my room was gone and I found myself in a place unfamiliar to anything I had seen before. The walls looked as if they evolved into something better, a fancy type of wood rich people talk about when discussing wood and whatnot. The carpet let go of my feet and I cautiously walked to the only visible door down this field of carpet which was slowly turning into grass with each additional step I took. I felt a sting on the bottom of my foot, a pain strong than that of any I’ve felt in years. I fell down and viciously grabbed my foot to find what appeared to be a wasp stinger in my foot which I tore from my throbbing foot, implementing fear that my walking would have to end here and force me to crawl to the still distant door.
	My foot was beginning to swell making walking more difficult with each step. I got to the door and opened it
	I opened my eyes and realized everything up to that point was a dream. I could still hear the slow rain playing dissonant music in my backyard. I sat on the edge of my bed and rubbed my useless eyes.  I had no desire to get out of bed and make use of this Saturday; I already had gone through a week of hell in school and planned on using this day for resting and possibly reading a little Vonnegut. realizing sitting on the edge was as useless as sitting on the edge of the grand canyon, always hunched over a little and slowly moving my arms around anticipating a wall to punch me in the face. I found what I was looking for and sat at a chair in my kitchen waiting for something to happen. Nothing happened.

Warning

My worst nightmare just came true. There I was, I turned around and saw the most horrible thing. It was one of those giant centipedes. There he was, just sitting there, in the 1/2 inch gap between my door frame and the wall. I was scared. I could never squish them cause I could feel their guts explode and it felt weird. So here I was, at 11 p.m. I was at a loss for words. Then I remembered seeing my dad's light on not 15 minutes earlier. I opened my door in the hopes that he was still awake. His light was off. I was on my own.

There was no way I could go to sleep knowing he was there. I had to muster up the strength to kill him. I stood there nearly 10 minutes contemplating my actions. I grabbed a notepad that I use to squash bugs. I thought about if he would be one if the smart ones that would run away as soon as he saw a shadow. I guess he wasn't smart. I finally garnered up the courage, or so I hoped. He wasn't quite dead yet. I could hear his unattached legs moving on the paper. I quickly scooped him up and put him in the trash. Making sure to squash him once more for good measure.

 Many years had passed since the great civil war. Countries collapsed, a plan to turn all of the disaster around for the better of the world. There would be no competition either; no one else knew how to revoke the attention of the people.  This man was to give a speech, outside the city of Arcadia in the hills of the Father, televised to the entire world to get a glimpse of this savior. Although the entire world had faith in him, to save the world from the point of no return, there was a small group of souls, people who knew the truth of this man. They were known as “The Resistance” an organization bent on taking this man from his throne over the people. The Savior protested that The Resistance were only terrorists; here to frighten the everyday soul into believing of the coming end. But The Resistance knew the truth, to fool the world into his doing, the human race took its first steps in time travel. They built a machine capable of sending messages across time, natural disasters. It was kept as a piece of property owned by the UN
    The man wore black suit with a calm demeanor, burning every error until there wasn’t a blemish left in his presentation. The scene he was presenting in was elegant too, on a hill top facing the masses with the sun setting behind him. This will surely win the hearts of all. He held his papers in his hands, reading over each line again and again. 
	He stood on the podium constructed on the hill top, maybe he had the right to be. The grass covered hill was now covered in a carpet of people, many bringing lawn chairs, others sitting on the sun warmed grass, others standing, applauding the savior on his perch. He cast a radiant smile that beamed like the sun over the viewers, even into the lenses of the cameras
	“Good evening, the weak, the weary, and give light of hope for a new future to all of us here on planet Earth today.” Cheers from the audience echoed around the hills that encased them all, like echoes of time bringing back the cheers of many other grand speeches given at this very spot. 
    “We all know of our state, we can’t even look our friend in the eye anymore without a flavor of doubt in our mouths. But here tonight, I would like to put a rest to those fears, so we may live in peaceful existence, like we had before the Great War.” The cheers were let out again, whistles flying through there air like released turtle doves, finding their lovers

Under me we will live in harmony, our world will flourish, and humanity—WILL—RISE—AGAIN!!!” The earth shook with the rumbling of applause, the audience had decided this man will lead them to a new day, a new golden age for the human race. The Audience began to chant, he had won their vote. But the churning thoughts inside the Savior’s mind began to bubble onto his skin. He smiled a little, like paintings printed over and over to make a scene. They showed mass slaughters, sitting with a smug look on his face
   
 “What is the matter? You all look like you’ve seen a monster!”
    
  “We’re looking at one is why.” One audience member piped. The Savior looked at his skin, and conquering like a movie without a plot, nothing but to shock the viewers into disbelief.
  “It’s  not what you think—, calling up judgments to the falling king, 
   
 “Was this your true plan for us?”
    
 “You can’t keep a truth from the people forever!” Soon it was like a runoff of water in spring
  “You can’t leave!” He called, sharp as knives heated with hate and greed, His eyes glowing red with his new found power, “I—AM—YOUR—GOD!” A wave of unfathomable energy passed over the crowd, changing their perspectives, losing all sense of logic.

A few miles due West of the port just outside Nassau, though it was obvious it had once been a proud asset to the Spanish fleet. As the ship rocked back and forth, the loose cannon balls did the same as the ship approached the harbour. A column of seagulls neared the port at the same rate of the vessel, clearly picking at something on the top deck. As dawn broke and the sun illuminated the waters, one watchman was able to spot with his telescope, saw the Spanish flag and immediately went to ring the alarm bell. However before he did, he thought he noticed something odd about this particular craft. None of the cannons were primed to shoot, who despite standing up and stumbling about


Through the narrow circle with which he inspected the ship, the watchman finally rang the alarm bell, and his commanding officers ordered a few rescue boats to be sent to the ship and recover any survivors. As the rowing boats approached the ship, the water damage to the craft became very apparent. They climbed up the side of the ship to inspect the crew. Once up, none of the rescue team could see or find any of the crew; only some pained groaning coming from the shadows made them think there was anyone still on board. A young crewman named George was amongst the rescue party that was sent out that morning. He had made several friends in New Providence, and was planning a family with his fiancé who until six hours ago had been his girlfriend.

Kevin wonders what he's supposed to say. There must be a manual on this somewhere, pick up the remote, the emptiness in her face. She stares at the black television screen. He tries to think of something to talk about, something that isn't the thing.

He decides on a topic. “I'm making a pizza

Again

He wonders how long this will last, no time for Kevin to ask him, man to man, what he is supposed to talk about with her, how long she will be like this, what signs to look for should it turn serious. Kevin wishes now that he had insisted they step out of the room so his questions could be answered. In the moment, though, he certainly had not been expecting it, too.

But Laura, of course, that he must be in some kind of pain, but maybe not, he is in the kitchen now, cooking a pizza like nothing is wrong. And what had he said to her, on the ride home? “We can try again in a few weeks.” Laura could not think about that

Though the doctor told her it was highly unlikely, a slight pain in her side, insignificant, she would have thought nothing of it, except. The blood didn't come until hours later, but some part of Laura was expecting it, had felt the pain and then later, had wondered for just a minute if she were getting her period. The doctor had said the pain was probably unrelated

Having put the pizza in the oven, scanning the headlines. The silence is maddening. She hasn't turned the television on. He thinks about the calls they should make, to his parents and hers. He does not want to hear their cries of sympathy, their packaged responses, “Everything's going to be okay,” “Time will heal this.” Perhaps even secrets, from one mother or the other, too

Of course, life goes on. He knows marriages survive this sort of thing, that the silence is only temporary, but his is not just any marriage and his wife is not like other wives. Laura, the beauty he'd met eight years ago, in college, the dancer. Such strength in the way she moved, in a sense, such anger

He hears Laura rise from the couch – finally, and she is standing at the bookshelf, fidgeting with something, and as Kevin watches her, he notices that her body hasn't changed in all the years he's known her, still so lean and strong. She turns toward the sofa, and Kevin strains to see what she has done, with a flicker in the corner of his eye

Laura knows he's watching her, too, that he cannot be fooled, that at times, he seems to see through her. When she met Kevin, she'd been waiting for a man like him. Laura so willingly engaged in the charades, wanting to appear independent and determined and feminist, yet while trying to convince, a peaceful surrender. She let go of the games and expectations, feminine.

The down side in that liberation, for the first time, like a true woman, it also made him feel like a man. To protect her has become a part of his identity, certainly a part of their identity together, as a married couple. She'd wondered before what might make him vulnerable, had observed him closely as they sat in movie theaters watching tearjerkers, wondering if that might be the thing that would make him cry. She'd imagined taking his face in her hands as the tears came, as he shuddered with the sobs.

It makes her angry to think about the thing that is happening now, and she feels weak, and she is not sure which came first.
The refrigerator opens, “We can't wait for the new addition to our family! All the best as you begin your journey as parents. Love, Mom &amp; Dad.” Kevin contemplates throwing it away.

He walks into the living room, though hard for him to admit, more beautiful in her pain. He'd noticed earlier, too, when he found her in the bathroom, sitting in front of the toilet, and he'd had the thought that she must've vomited, it's to be expected. But as he approached, they made her blue eyes look like crystal, into the toilet

Kevin is standing now, feels his fingers in her hair.

“Babe?” he says quietly. She throws her head back, and she is just feeling it, she tells her mind to stop working, closes her eyes and summons blackness behind them.

Kevin tries to remember the last time they made love because they needed to, scheduled, even. For one purpose, to make a baby. He wants her now, and as he kisses her face, he slides his hands down her body, over her breasts. He hears her wince and he pulls them away.

The doctor had been clear. Six weeks. Rest. Then, feels like something was taken from them, the minute they began having sex to conceive. Kevin is sitting next to her now, and she can see his desire, is both thankful for and disgusted by it.

Kevin is feeling something strange, it is everywhere, in his bones, even. Perhaps it is the memory that comes to him, the memory of the last time they made love for the pleasure of it, it was the night Laura showed him the pregnancy test. It had been celebratory, fun. After Laura came, she'd burst into laughter, “I love you.” Kevin had been thinking

It's Laura,” she says, and stands, heads for the stairs. He tries to tell her he loves her, but this thing is choking him. Instead, he watches her climb the steps until she disappears.

He cries only for a minute, and if things will be different in the morning.

TRUE! Neverous, not erased nor dulled them. Above all was the sense of taste acute. I could taste all things in the heaven and in the earth. I’ve tasted many things in heaven, and even more in hell. How then am I mad? Hark, and observe how healthily, how calmly I can tell the whole story.
 
I know not why the idea entered my brain,” OH YEA!” my blood ran cold, and so by degrees, I made up my mind to rid myself of the man, at least for a while.
 
This is my point. You fancy me mad. Mad thirsty men know nothing. But you should’ve seen how wisely I proceeded—with that caution—with what foresight, one by one to avoid suspicion. Nightly, I’d peek my head into the refrigerator, making sure the poor fool was sleeping. Would a madman come during daylight, to be once again tortured by his cries of “OH YEA!”?
 
Upon the eighth and final night, knowing full good and well that he’d not cry a sound soon enough. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph; what with the plan I’d made, and I chuckled at the idea that I’d finally won. Perhaps he heard me, causing him to toss and turn in his sleep. Now, you may think that I turned back, but no, the insides were still pitch black as the switch had not been switched to shed light upon my devious mayhem. Suddenly an itch took hold, the door had opened full swing
 
I’d enough of his dastardly cries, and with the speed of light flooding my hands, I grabbed him by the handle and hastily poured his sweet blood into the tray. He began to groan “Oh~!” but before he could, I sealed his doom with the see-through fate of Seran wrap. Muffled, I could hear him still; the sound haunted me, so I grabbed the nearest toothpicks and proceeded to bury them into the blood of the evil bastard. I had won.
 
My hands stained with his crimson blood, things were peaceful. I could sleep at night without a sound, and go throughout my day without the cursed words leaving his tongue. Yet if you still deem me mad, you will think so no longer, when I describe how the tale unfolds.
 
After a few hours, and had politely asked where he might’ve gone. I bade them search the trash can and even the container he was stored in. Clean.
 
My manner had convinced them. I was at ease. Until I could hear his ghastly call once more. “OH YEA!” Rang throughout my mind, and as my flatmates decided to trek out to find one more, and as my heart began to pulsate with the ever chilling dread of the deed I’d committed, my mind just wanted them gone.

I get to the door and crack it open. Bold as brass behind the screen door stands the mailman. "" Package for ya son "" he says softly with a New England slant. I open the screen door and sign for the delivery; a pair of shoes I'd ordered yesterday, but I know he hasn't brought my mail before. I can't put my finger on it. About 6""6 with a farmers tan and a smile to put Willem Dafoe to shame, he's not exactly hard to miss. I surrender the battle and just chalk it up to one of those things.

I suddenly realise if I look anything like I feel, just mumble a thank you and slouch back inside.

I don't make it to the kitchen counter before I half collapse, even from the day before. ""Must have been a real barn burner."" I claw some aspirin out of the medicine cabinet. I swallow three with water from the tap. My hands are shaking and my spit tastes like gasoline. I can feel the cold sweats starting at the base of my spine.

I pop another aspirin and stare at the bottle. Full. I swear it was almost empty when I took it out. ""Fuck it!"" I go to lie back down in bed and realise I don't even know what time it is. Looking out the window I peg it at around two in the afternoon. 

I crawl back into bed and pull the curtains. I close my eyes for what feels like seconds and then decide to check the time. 9:17pm. "" Fuck! "" I must have passed straight out. I open the curtains back up. Broad daylight

Red spots appear on my denim thigh and I put my fingers to my nose and pull them away soaked in blood. I put my head in my hands and take a minute to try and calm down.

That's when I hear the footsteps on the porch.

  In the dayS where everyone was so innocent, in the PAST believed to be your ""bestest friend ever"".

Then eventually they move away leaving you to the place that you dread calling home. 
  
  The girls
  
  The next four years of your life will determine you. A quote from the movie, but quite a brilliant bit of it. This describes the dreaded four in nearly every way. What if you don't choose these things though? well there is one more choice. Addiction. Now I, by no means succumb to the peer pressure, I am still what some would call a ""good boy"" decent grades, active in extracurricular activities, plenty of friends, and no children. My choice is life. Even though the current times tell me that happiness in the future starts with happiness in the childhood, sadly more traveled in my environment, live life happily. Choose something risky, is key to the choice of life.

  If you take your core personality and ponder it, So-called Friends, hobbies, and religious beliefs are the only things that matter if you choose life. Being the only truly important factors doesn't mean they are easily maintained. Thats where your early life affects you. To maintain ""life"" you need to mimic the activities of the stereotypical ""good boy/girl"". Thats what determines how you are taken in by society. They could take you in with the other thirty-nine good boy/girls or, they could cling on to the fact that you made a single choice pertaining to the category of addiction. One sign of change, and you aren't accepted by the all so real council of life. You then, dont get to choose a job, at the very bottom. Right next to the people you refered to as trash. The choice of life is a very delicate one. If you spend to much time doing what you are told, but really, no job
1349144368.0,10sn0f,The Interview of a Lifetime,tyh64,5,1,0,"I had this dream.

I was sitting
I knew that I was outside of a conference room
The room had a fairly simple setup. There was a secretary scribbling something on a notepad
 
I was nervously rehearsing my answers for the interview that I knew that I was about to go to. I don’t remember what my answers were. I was just ready to tell the interviewers what they wanted to hear.

I became aware that the clock’s ticking was quite loud.
 
A pepper-haired man stuck his head out of the conference room door and said
“We’re ready for you now. Come on in.”
He went back into the room but left the door open.
 
I followed the man into the room and looked around.
Outside the window
It looked so peaceful.
 
Someone’s bike reflector flashed in the sun and caused me to blink.
 
I looked in front of me and saw the pepper-haired man sitting across the table with two men that were sitting to his right and to his left.
To his right
To his left, a wrinkled polo shirt, and had a sense of arrogance about him.
 
I donned a fake smile
My heart was no longer pounding.
I was relaxed and confident.
 
“So
“Yea
 
This was a typical interview question
This was the point of no-return. My response would change my life forever.
 
 ...
 
I thought about my entire life up until this moment:
 
One time when I was only six years old, and immediately panicked. I sat down and cried until my mother came to clean it up for me. She told me that there was no reason cry, because I had to be strong. I remembered the sense of duty I had to show no weakness.
 
No more than a year later, better than the rest.
However
Live your life for you
 
When I was nine, because of my new glasses.
Maybe this meant that I couldn’t be whatever I wanted to be in life.
 
I remembered playing “Truth or Dare” when I was twelve at Brittany Winter’s birthday party. I was dared to kiss the most popular girl in school, and worrying the entire night what would happen if my mother found out what I had done.
 
When I was thirteen
 
When I was fifteen, I realized that I was more afraid of my mother driving by and asking me what I was doing standing on the street corner by myself.
 
I remembered deciding at sixteen that there was more money in becoming a doctor. From there
From then on
After all
I was the smartest
I was the one for the job.
 
 ...
 
It was then that I realized I had been staring at my feet for some while.
I looked up at the men to see all three of their faces unpatiently waiting for a reply.
The pepper-haired man re-iterated their questions:
“So
 
I thought about this question for a while and wondered how I managed to find myself sitting in that chair.
I realized that I wasn’t happy.
I didn’t know who I was anymore
I have never felt so lost.
 
I finally lifted my head and looked the pepper-haired man right in the eyes.
I slowly stood up and said
 
“I don’t.”

They are usually fluttering around, faces, people? What they see, or what we missed? I do not know, nope. I do not. And they move fast, really fast. Oh, and that one is smiling at me. I like it when they smile
 
Describe them? Oh no, red, blue, yes. And then some I have never seen in my life. Strange, swirling colors, like the color of joy. I do not know the color, but that's what color his robe is right now. They are big and strong, all at once. A living contradiction; yup
 
The other ones might be, not a bit. They scare me, very dark and eerie. They look like giant bats, always there, clinging to people. They are horribly, horribly ugly, with leather wings and distorted faces. Even scarier is when they pretend to be beautiful people. I am glad that they can't hide their flicking tail, it's an evil
 
But they don't like the beautiful ones. That's why I stay near them, especially when they start singing. It's more beautiful than any choir I've ever heard before. They like to hang aroun the zoo. Always a lot of them there, and at the hospital near here. I don't have the money to go to the hospital though. Sometimes they help me, and point to a good spot to find food or a blanket, or a warm place to sleep at night. Yes, I like the beautiful ones a lot.
 
There are a whole bunch of them up ahead. They are all crowed around a building, and I can't wait to go inside. That one is shaking his head at me. Why? I won't stay long, won't cause any trouble. Sometimes that bothers people, but I won't do that. I just want to go inside...
 
What happened? Oh no, everywhere I look. They are crawling all over people sitting on the cushioned benches. There is a man up front talking to them. No, wait, it's not a man; it's one of the uglies. I almost missed his tail. That was close. None of the people are scared. Can't they see the uglies? Maybe they are used to it.
 
I am really scared. Maybe if I stand really still and quiet, scooting further and further away. But I won't hurt them; it's the uglies they should be worried about. Can they really not see them? I just want to find more beautiful ones.
 
 I run back outside. The same beautiful one who shook his head at me earlier, and I start to cry. Why would people bring the uglies into such a beautiful place?

It was the only tree around as far as one could see  ; an anomaly disturbing the horizon. Humans within its locality made use of it in navigation and thus it held sentimental value. It was later termed “The lonely tree”. The following is a short anecdote about this tree written by a human born many decades after the death of the tree:

*The lonely tree that existed in Africa is now widely known and celebrated for unclear reasons. As far as I can tell, destroying it beyond regrowth . The death of their only landmark soured the mood of the people who had become fond of passing by it , perhaps even admiring its unlikely growth. But they moved on and accepted the unfortunate conclusion of a finite natural phenomenon.* 

*Upon discovery of this tale by tourists , or how they survived there . A page for this tree even got dedicated on Wikipedia so others may easily find out about it and long for moments past when it stood alone in the African desert . Eventually people sharing this view assembled and put up a metal monument at the location where it once stood; a true testament to their collective communication and desire.*

*The future generations of the local population may ask about the origins of such a contraption in the middle of an otherwise flat desert.* 

*Eventually it may become accepted as the lonely tree in the middle of the desert. A later day may see a drunken vehicle operator destroying it*.

1348663157.0,10i4u1,Untitled works not by password_is_spy (Sorry user),password_is_spy,3,1,1,"Upon arriving at the school I was groggy. Not much sleep last night. I was at an elementary school serving as security. Today there was going to be a demonstration for the kids on military might and air superiority

The school was located next to a mountain that the military had barred off to the public. Convenient enough there was a base not far from the school. The mountain was off limits to civilians since an accident occurred there involving military personal and the story was that some chemicals leaked out

I was standing with my back next to a pillar just outside the school fences with some kids next to me eagerly awaiting the big event. The military had brought in some tanks but we were told they wouldn't be firing

I figured there would be a speaker giving some talk on how great these new jets were. That was the whole point right? As we waited our attention was gathered to some General Pierce, don't know why they would but that's what I'm being paid for. 

After Pierce said his few words he left with what seemed like more protection than anything else. Don't know what that was about except that his ego is probably through the roof. 

The jets made their first pass and the kids cheered and then got quite and awaited their next one. Then on their second pass

The jets begin to land and the first one landed outside of the school fences next to me. I didn't like the idea of the pilot landing and standing near me

After landing the pilot came out and greeted the kids. He told them to gather behind me and sit on the ground so that he could see all of them

He started talking again telling the kids how great it was flying a jet

As quickly as the shootings began

The pilot went to his jet and tried to lift off but their was something wrong with it. He got out and I heard him communicating with someone

He pulled out a rifle from a compartment on the jet began to head toward the mountain. I asked him what he was doing and he just looked at me and kept going. I don't know why but I followed him. He told me one the way to wherever we were headed that I needed to go back. I told him I wasn't going anywhere

As we got closer I noticed there were shipping containers scattered about near what appeared to be the entrance to the mountain. They were covered with rock and camouflaged netting colored just like the mountain. Inside it looked like there was some installation. I had no idea what it was. People began to open fire on us as and we took cover behind one of the containers. 

He handed me a pistol along with a few clips and asked me if I knew how to use it. I had previous training and told him so.  

As the men got closer we shot them one after another but I knew we both would run out of ammo soon. We got lucky as two of them had somehow snuck past us and made their way behind the containers we had been using for cover. I only noticed them because I had just reloaded and after shooting them my heart was pounding. This was scary. I picked up their guns and they looked almost exactly like the rifle that the pilot had but there was something different about them but I couldn't put my finger on it. 

The pilot told me he was planning on heading inside. I didn't know why and he told me to stay here. I told him he was crazy but that if he was going to go in I was heading in there with him

He had his orders just like the men in the tanks had theirs. They were still firing on the mountain and it could only mean that they were ordered to fire until given the order to recede. I had my orders too.

We noticed that men stopped exiting the facility as we got closer and I told him it could be some kind of ambush. He agreed and we proceeded with caution. 




Entering the facility we found men ripped apart. Their bodies were scattered about and neither of us had any idea what was did this
Shortly after some of the same men we were firing upon began to rush into the area from one of the halls. They were retreating from something. Five of them kept firing down the hall and only hid behind the corners when they needed to reload. Some switch was activated and a doorway leading into the hall was closing

There was something on the other side of the door

When I looked back to the pilot he was still on the console. I took a moment to just look around the room. There was shipping containers in here as well

This pilot was still concerned about his mission and I didn't even know his name. I asked him and he just said it didn't matter

My head was turned only for a few moments but it was enough time for something to shoot out before the door completely sealed and hit the pilot. He fell to the ground and within seconds some sort of poison began working through his body. He wasn't in any pain other than the area he was it that I could tell. I tried to have him hang on to me as I carried him but I knew it wouldn't work. I laid him against the side of one of the containers and brought him his rifle. I asked him what I needed from the jet and through slurred words he told me there was a belt in a compartment inside the jet. He mumbled something like “I can't believe it” and I told him I would be right back.

I exited the installation and entered chaos. There were flying creatures all around. They were massive

I managed to make it to the jet without any trouble and I found the belt. It wasn't sure what I thought it would be but what it was was some sort of device. On the belt there were seven shells

I headed back to where I left the pilot and found a man tending his wounds. He told me he had been poisoned, yelling in agony. I turned and saw this creature that had what appeared to have giant curved blades for arms hissing at us. I hesitated for a moment but I shot and killed it. The man was bleeding out and didn't say anything. He just looked at me if wanting to say sorry. 

I tried not to think about what I had just seen and asked the pilot if he could manage to make it out with me. He nodded and as I lifted him up he told me I would need to set the timer on one of the shells. As we stood we heard noises coming from the last hallway and turned to see creatures emerging it. We were quickly surrounded with them gnarling and growling at us.

I set the pilot down and he told me to take one of the shells off and throw it on the ground. I assumed we would be dead after so I asked the pilot his name. “Landers,,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,True

Over the next two weeks we would plan our route
Plans have a way of falling apart. Commitments from friends
The Saturday morning came, a quick blast to get the blood flowing. Merging into traffic with the throttle wide open, shifting through gears  up into sixth. Looking down I was suprised to see my speed. It didn't feel like I was going that fast. Easing up on the throttle and asimulating with the flow of the traffic around me, I took a deep breath and settled into the seat. 
The first leg of the journey was about an hour of highway. (this is a classic new hampshire coloquialism: in reference to distance, it can almost place the rider into a lull or meditative state. You can completely forget everything. The everyday problems of your life are trivial. You aren't quite completely focused but not quite in a trance like state. This can be dangerous because you are travelling on a vehicle that you are actively balancing, at 70 mph. The actual reality is that any small mistake could kill you or leave you seriously injured. That is why the best highway rides are uneventful.
I arrived in Lincoln New Hampshire, the motorcycle is free at last. Twisting turns through untouched forrest keep you sharp and alert. The air is sweet, and smells different then city air. Climbing hills with banking turns, the CBR was made for this. The hills peak quickly and just a quickly as I reach the top I am descending in the opposite direction. Constantly working the controls, just to stay on the road, takes all your focus and attention. Racing up the hills are simple enough crack the throttle open and hang on, as I reach the apex of a hill I can feel my stomach lift for a moment as the road quickly turns, I stay on the gas and look as far down the road as I can see. Descending hills with turns at speed is equally challenging. I make a wise decision to downshift
At the base of Mt. Washington there is a small field and a small shack. Its two dollars to take the auto road to the top. The man in the booth gives me a sticker ""this motorcycle climbed Mt. washington"" Thats a bit premature, world record ascent, very quick time , forget the time but he looked happy. 
I mounted back onto my bike and began my ascent. I was suprised the road was paved. The road is nice and there are lots of trees, I guess figuring I was more nimble then they were amongst the bumps and holes. As I  made my way above the treeline, the pavement ends. It is replaced by a smooth dirt road. It is easy to ride on even on a sportbike. The views are spectacular even before the summit. I can see the nearby mountains, and their peaks, a sea of green forrest in painted variance that is impossible to capture. As the dirt road continues upward wrapping up the sides of the mountain, the colors around me change from green to brown. Gone are the trees and pavement, replaced by basketball sized rocks, a mistake would surely be fatal. Roads below look pencil thin
When I do reach the top, the temperature, is easily 30 degrees cooler at the summit, and the wind is constant. The wind pushes  around 30 mph, and gusts to 50 every minute or so. There is a large concrete structure at the top. Inside the building are some historic photos, black and whites of some tough looking men who built the road to the summit. Also cheesy t-shirts of a tourist hanging onto a flag pole being blown horizontal by the world record wind. I left empty handed from the gift shop and went back outside. I took one more long look out from the top. Annother plaque indicated that on a clear day, you can see skyscrapers in  Boston, and turnded it around.

Would like some feedback(critique) on the following excerpt : 

&gt;Looking out my window i could see the lights in the city dump. The huge pile of cars, lived there. They were not allowed inside the city, though everyone knew they came into it at night. Pillaging for food scraps from the streets bellow. I lived there as a child, among them. Running between the cars and the sludge. I was safe now, as safe as a slummer child could be that is. I was one the lucky ones, most didn't make it past their childhood. Killed by city guards, freak accidents

&gt;I remember those days, especially the fatter ones. It's funny how i feel nostalgic about those days. Nowadays i get access to the city rations. Rations are dehydrated products, vegetables grown in underground green houses with artificial lighthing and some smaller animal meat.The dehidrated dog legs and cat liver are by far the best. The days of dehydrated cow and sheep meat is long gone, I don't even remember eating any of it. The bigger animals started dying at the same time we started losing daylight and all the stocked up rations were eaten.  Rations were only distributed to the patrons, so in order to eat we had to scavenge the city. Getting inside the city was a not an easy feat. In order to leave the dump we had to crawl under an electrified fence watched by guard patrols and the ocasional howlghast. Vicious geneticly engineered creatures with an incredible sense of smell and thick musculate legs. A ghast bite could rip a grown man apart, and they often did. Guards had the cruel habit of releasing their ghast in the dump and betting on which one would bring the bigger piece. Sometimes we just sat there watching the patrols, looking for a way in. We weren't allways sucessful

He'd tell me he's been raised here all his life, too, based on my story. He's actually on the way to clean out her apartment, and the only key he could find is the one was the one he decorated for her in third grade. He tears up as he shows me, it's the only key floating around in his pocket not attached to a key ring.

I hold his hand, because even though I have work to do, this just feels right.

And he starts to smile, the elevator starts again. We make out until it reaches his floor.

We giggle. We go back to his late-mother's apartment holding hands. We have passionate sex on the floor. And when I'm done

1345071748.0,yadzm,Steve has a lot on his mind.,skingstrang,3,0,2,"When Steve met Her at their usual rendez-vous coffee shop

Steve just wasn’t Her type of person.

Or would it be “Her’s type of person”? Steve wasn’t really quite sure about the grammatical ramifications of having a name like Her. They had been together for so long, but instead by the name that his friends had picked up using. “Are you bringing Her?” “Is this yours or is this Her’s?” “Don’t you think about anything besides Her?” That last one was a tricky question, Steve had found, as he did think about things that weren’t Her, but mostly because of Her (Her’s?) influence. He thought about the bands she enjoyed, the movies they’d watched together, and the fact that he hated sleeping/eating/being alone, weren’t they? If he thought of Her as “Her

But that’s just the type of person Steve is.

When Steve was in 3rd grade
The first day on the ferry, but the motion simply made Steve miss his mother and he decided to curl up with his sack of loving food and clothes at 7:30pm, more than an hour and half before the other children would retire. That night, Steve vomited all over his sack, rendering the food inedible. The next day, Steve, dressed in the clothes of one of his school mates, Steve was feeling quite better and, chocolate milk

Because that’s the type of person that Steve is.

	Steve had never had particular difficulty getting into relationships with women, about three quarters of a foot shorter than Steve, with long, well maintained, nice smelling brown hair. They hung out for five months. They had sex twice. Steve then realized how completely incompatible they were. How could he ever spend any portion of his life with someone who was mildly religious? Or didn’t appreciate the meaningful subtleties of a composition by The Smiths? Besides, Steve had Her on his mind the whole time.

Because that’s the kind of person that Steve was.

	When Steve was still a teenager

Because that was just the type of person that Steve was.

	Once, was surprised to learn that the door wasn’t locked at all. Immediately, Steve was returned to that ferry ride, the stench of vomit with a needy feeling and a rocking sensation. Steve found his father face down on his couch, surrounded by cans and bottles of beer. Handles of liquor. Anti-depressants and sleeping aids. There was a unhealthy looking dog tied up in the kitchen that Steve had never seen before who wouldn’t stop barking. Steve sat on the edge of the couch, checked his father’s pulse with two fingers, and then wrote a note that said:

“I love you

Steve placed the note in his father’s hand, though. He drove in the opposite direction until he ran out of gas.

Steve was just that type of person sometimes.

	Steve was still sitting in his car, the phantom didn’t respond. Steve turned on his car. He wondered whether or not he was an optimist. Would an optimist want there to be a heaven? Or would he rather rot in the ground, free for eternity? Steve supposed it really depended on what type of person they had been in their life. Steve asked the ghost whether or not his father had been an optimist. The ghost didn’t respond. Probably, thought Steve. ",,False,,False,t3_yadzm

Its artificially pumped atmosphere visibly pulled towards its twin, many legged landing craft waited to be deployed. One of them flashed to life. In the thinly stretched atmosphere the normal noise of sirens and grinding steel the signaled the release of one of the landers was damped to a near whisper.

The lander dislodged its legs from the side of the craft and reversed them downward toward the planet below. Once it was completely free and the magnetic teeth firmly gripped the craft unlatched. leaving it tethered only by a looping black cord. for a moment it lay motionless until a gust of pressurized air sent it adrift in the pitch black space around it. It drifted further and further from its home until being snapped up by the gravity of the planet below. It started to tumble faster and faster but the cord snapped taught catching the tiny craft.

The lander was lowered slowly, many legged spider dissenting on the dust bellow. Cranks clicked as the craft was lowered, swaying in the light breeze from the unmoving carrier ship so many kilometers above. When the craft was 20 feet above the cracked dry earth it, save for the light hushing of hydraulic joints, silently dissented on its prey. One of by one each of its eight legs gently grasped the surface, stirring up the dust around the each of the padded landing feet like sand stirred up in a river bed, cloaking the intruder from the barren plain. The ground pressed down two or three inches

The metal beast sat unmoving for a movement. With an audible a hiss and a click the magnetic bond between the lander and the barely visible carrier craft. After a moment the tether between the two ships shuttered. The rope whizzed up moving at a blur, lighting up the dark around it in a perfect circle of swirling eerie fog.

A red light stained the fog, blowing away the last remainder of the stirred up sand. The light reached father in the now clear air. Catching on small rocks and cracks, radiating shadows around the steady light. Dust curled around the metal rectangle as it finally pressed against the powder ground.

For a moment the men shuffled uneasily, one by one, leaving shallow boot prints in the sand. One of the men, the tallest, walked out away from the crouching ship and Reaching out into the fading umbra, he was careful to keep both feet planted in the brightest part of the light he could. He paused before reaching behind his neck to turn a small dial fixed to his collar. With a warm hum a small light on his wrist grew to life. The father he turned it the stronger a soft light shining from his sleeve became. He shined the light in front of him scattering the darkness and forming a tunnel of white clean light 15 feet in front of him, collapsing slowly after that.

A grey pole

The two men flanked him

As Reached out his hand to grasp he pole the two wrist-lights behind him flicked in unison leaving him, he didn’t bother to turn around again and the reached out and grabbed it. The lights flicked again, this time not only lights on the teams wrists but the florescent tubes lining the landers legs all in unison, plunging him, just for a fraction second, into complete darkness.

The man tried to turn and run back to his companions but he found he could not move his hand form the pole. He shuffled around the pole to face the lander, still franticly trying to remove his hand from its grasp.

For a moment the two men’s eyes met and turned to look at whatever the deranged man was looking at. He shuffled over turning his back once more to the lander and saw, it was only able reach as far as the closest lander feet but that was all he saw. The two other men had vanished in an instant without a sound. He called out on every channel on my communicator. The booster to contact the carrier ship was an impossible twenty feet away on the lander platform.

A light scraping brought his attention to his left. He called out the names of his two companions but no one answered. He heard the sound again to right and whirled around as far as his trapped hand would allow. He shone his light out but again only rocks and dust. He heard the sound again, like two sheets of sandpaper being rubbed together.

His hand released form pole and he broke out into a run, weighing him down. He could feel the suit pressing against his skin as they struggled to pull him farther into the swirling darkness. They pushed into the light of his wrist light. Tentatively at first but then they pushed against each other until it too flickered and died.

It was only a shade because he had never truly had a fully formed thought about it. ‘It’ was an emotionally destructive event that had happened only a day prior. The thoughts he had had about it weren’t full in that they lacked any amount of emotion; they were totally logical

He was no stranger to such a thing; this had happened to him a number of times before in similar situations

The event was that his girlfriend had broken up with him. Naturally

‘There are other fish in the sea’ was entirely obvious. The boy knew he would eventually find someone else

‘Don’t give up! You can get her back!’ was foolish: no he couldn’t. The only way she would want to be with him again would be if she made the decision of her own accord. People were stubborn. Unwavering. Illogical. Their minds could not be changed on these matters.

‘Don’t be too sad’ was the most curious. Its stupidity and uselessness aside, internal. Its effects on his behavior were nothing more than some tiredness, and perhaps a tendency not to laugh as hard at jokes. Anyone who was unaware what had happened would assume he was just low on sleep; not that an event of immense consequence had just occurred in his life. Quiet sadness.

The boy knew from experience (both personal and of others) that ‘getting over a breakup’ typically involves a feeling of superiority, he felt. It was natural, and he had nearly given into it, but he had stopped himself. Perhaps he was above her, but not by all that much. He tried his best not to think any lower of her than she objectively deserved. 
The silhouette of a tree outside his window shone through the shades. He stared as it danced in the wind for half a minute
Seemingly out of nowhere, he thought; that unrelenting desire to show himself that it didn’t matter. That she was inconsequential, and that the prior event had been a fortunate one. But it hadn’t been. And he knew that he could never truly ‘get over her’ unless he accepted that it had indeed been a bad occurrence. 
And she truly was not a stupid bitch. She was a wonderful, she possessed a select few qualities that made the two of them incompatible. It was a terrible shame.

At that moment, “There you are, sweetie. I’ve been looking for you. What are you doing in here all by yourself?”

“Nothing

By Miles B.



“We were such kids back then.” She sighed.
 
The vapor from her breath hung cold in the air, but it didn’t matter. Our thoughts were in the same place, even if our hearts had drifted. She nuzzled her head into my shoulder, familiar and unnoticed, and we gazed into the flames.
 
The fire licked distantly at our cheeks
 
“This feels right
 
Earlier that evening we had driven east, leading us forward. We drove past fences, beyond street signs, and into the forest. Our car slowly shrank, and we became infants among the tall pines lining our path. We kept driving, until the neatly groomed asphalt turned slowly into cracking concrete, which eventually shattered into gravel. Unsurfaced and uncertain
 
I had found the old shack (or what remained of it) a few summers before; forgotten and alone. It was a silent place to visit, creatures and insects. They were all the same anyway: wildlife.
 
The structure was like a halfway house for fuckups, yearning for the sweet release of failure. The crumbled remains of a stone fireplace could be seen through four panes of cracked glass, half-burnt chair legs and used condom wrappers rested below its chimney. The front porch was a mess of rotten wood and missing planks, featuring a set of broken and splintered steps. The fractures were possibly from the weather, but more likely just fatigue, like everything else at the house, they were tired.
 
It had served as a shelter for the forgotten
 
“You know I loved you…” she tried again
“You were fourteen.” I replied. It was all I needed to say.
 
We watched from the dirt, hoodies and scarves. Our breath danced in front of us, as if mocking the subsiding flames before swiftly being evaporated.
 
 “Yeah, “So it’s not like age changes anything.” Her head shifted uncomfortably against my jacket.
“Whatever you say
 
Initially, not fully sinking into them, until aided by gasoline and lighter fluid. Finally the relentless heat managed to tear through the dew soaked paneling and consume the dry wood below. From there it grew. The sound of hissing floorboards and cracking doorframes echoed through the trees. Glass bits snapped and fumbled out of place, only feeding the chaos. BOOM. Something big exploded. Strained roof supports finally gave out, and the scale of the house came crashing inward. As the walls came down, the flames grew higher.
 
The cabin only had two rooms: a bedroom, two broken chairs, scattered trash and plastic bags, and a worn, faded rug. Mold covered everything in a stench too hard to swallow, like thick phlegm coating the back of your throat. It was a sanctuary to some, rock bottom for others.
 
“Well I’ve missed you.” She kept on.
“I miss you too.” I replied.
 
When we were together, and six months was a lifetime. Scribbled notes had turned into nervous phone calls, flowers became promises, and backseats turned into chapels. It was us against the world""and it was pointless.
 
We were dreamers then
 
Lust. Naivety. Passion. They were all our downfall.
 
The last time I’d seen her face prior to this was through the crack of an old wooden door, and faults turned into canyons between us. We didn’t communicate. We didn’t love. We just… were.
 
This was years ago, so much left up to interpretation. We needed closure""I needed it to end. 
 
“But won’t it burn everything down? She asked days before.
“It’s the right thing to do.” I responded. I didn’t even have to think. Her cheeks slowly crept into a smile
 
She had never been to the cabin before, and unbuckled my seatbelt. She did the same, and we walked to the slanted building.  She circled around it at first, peering through cracks, studying the roof, counting the windows. Looking through a gap in the paneling, she peered in and sniffed.
 
“You want to go in?” I asked.
“No.” She replied
 
The day before, CDs, a typewriter. Everything. We even folded down the seats to make more room for cargo. Clothes, cameras, photos, jackets, hats, we piled them all into the back of the car. Anything we found, we headed for the highway.
 
Letter after letter, only to watch them disappear. Each stitch on discarded baseballs slowly burned away, leather browning and stretching, ink sizzling off its face. I watched as my babied steel string acoustic, lightning bolt scratched into the pick guard, slowly twisted and snapped into the flames as if being rung out by something sinister. Keyboards, recorders, a child’s tambourine""we destroyed them all. All gone, all burned. Not gone""just repurposed. Into something new. Something fresh. Clean.
 
We didn’t talk much for the rest of the night, we watched from a distance. Dead leaves, frozen pine needles, and dried mud made up our seats""no blankets. We burned those too. We built ourselves a masterpiece from smoke and ash, like an embodiment of the past. Our magnum opus. Our final piece. It was beautiful. That’s how she saw it anyway.

You hurt your dad so much. Broke him. You're the reason he left. It should have been you."" 

     It was my fault he left. I stopped talking then he stopped being a dad. How could I talk to him? Someone so worthless like me being loved by someone so perfect like him. It wasn't fair. Eventually he stopped trying to talk to me. Soon I was nothing to him. Until he left. In my hand he left a note saying "" I love you."" I ripped it up and threw it away. I know the truth. No one could love me. 

      People say school is an escape. They're wrong. I find myself afraid and more self conscious than ever. It's not as if I'm bullied. No I have lots of ""friends"" but non of which actually know me. I put on that happy face and cheery laugh using every bit of energy trying not to fall apart. In my desk I feel the pairs of eyes watching me. I just sit there like the fat cow I am

Sleep is my bliss. The only part of the day I look forward to. Maybe one day I will sleep and never wake up. Stuck in a dream forever. One once said ""I cannot face reality so I get lost in my dreams

I will keep it to myself. The less people know the safer they are. They told me to grow up. I tried but how can someone who's past was so wonderful ever look forward at a life of misery and insanity. One day I will be normal. 

   Two of them are gone. Two people who I actually love. They left me here. Yes every once in a while they visit. Those are the best times. I get to actually be considered part of a family. She doesn't come after me when theyre home but when they leave the house goes silent. I love silence. Not this silence. This eerie quietness means she is thinking. Thinking of even flaw I have compared to them. I hear that voice in complete hysteria crying out. ""Why! Why me! I am a good mother! I don't deserve this!"" she is right. Nobody deserves to have me as a burden. 

       Run away. The thought rings through my head over and over again. I know I could but where would I run to. Family? No I've hurt them all. Friends? Nobody falls under this category. No. She would catch me and hate me even more. 

Today I wont eat. Things will be better when I'm skinny. People tell me im thin. I know theyre lying. I can see myself in the mirror. I used to be skinny. When things were better. No today I won't eat but I get there and they are watching my every move. People know if I don't so there I sit stuffing my face with anything to satisfy there stares. I remember the day she found out I didn't eat. ""how much do you weigh? You need help. Anorexic or something!"" Deny. Deny. Deny. Deny everything or loose everything. I tried the whole puking thing. Standing at the top of our hill choking on my fingers and anything else I could shove down my throat. Nothing worked. I even failed at that. When I grow up I won't have to eat. Then I can be skinny. Actually skinny. 

   I'm going home now. Praying no one will be there. Maybe I can be alone. There is the truck. I can feel my heart dropping into my gut

   My scratchy coat feels heavy on my shoulders. Tears sting my eyes threatening to pour over. What am I doing? I don't cry. Ever.

I have had many dreams and revelations during recent nights, not participating in the daredevil escapades that I have. I don't know what I would do without him.

When Felix and I were young
For weeks, carefully searching for Felix to return, but he never did. My heart was broken and my love for life was torn apart as my best friend vanished from my realm of reality. Fate betrayed me; I thought we had an understanding and the pain I felt from the loss of Felix was unacceptable.

One by one
Time lagged on until it was just mother and me. She did her best to keep my spirits up. I would often awake to her grooming me

As the weeks ticked by, as I dozed in and out of wakefulness, listening to the soft rain drumming on the roof, my world became smaller still.

I fought desperately, watching on as I too was being abducted. She never said a word. She didn’t even try to stop them from taking her last remaining child. 

I have never cried as much as I did that night, I held a memorial service for her, finally letting go of all hope from any reunion.

I spent several weeks hiding from the humans in my new prison. Their dog, I spent the time looking out the window, across the yard at their two pigs, Philly and Lilly, who were kept fenced in along the side of a big old red barn. 

Behind the barn, hopping into the chicken cage, chasing them all over the place. His long tongue, hung out of his mouth, flapping around as he ran back and forth. He could never stick to chasing one chicken for very long, as his attention would be grabbed by other frightened chickens running by. They looked terribly afraid.

It had been a long time since I smiled

After a couple of months being in confinement within my new adoptive parents’ house, was the one who insisted on letting me roam free, but his mom decided I required a harness and a leash. Although embarrassed to be seen by the other animals under control of the humans, I reluctantly agreed to their degrading demands. 

I laid in the grass, so peaceful. Everyone was happy, except me. I still had feelings of anger towards the humans, but if I wanted to return to my birthplace, I would need to gain their trust. This turned out to be more difficult than I imagined.

I was allowed outside with Ricky every day and after each excursion

Our next door neighbor had an old farmhouse too. He was tall and old. His wrinkles filled up with dirt very quickly, he and his dog were to be avoided and even Ricky kept away from them.

A while back, where the sky is dark and by default you feel dark as well. This was a storm where the rain falls warm, and the sun is still shining, and the rainbows are out, beckoning your smile to come and play. This was a shower where the drops hit the warm cement and you breathe in a scent that is fresh and suffocatingly sweet at the same time. This storm was beautiful and I desired to be a part of it. A corner of my mind told me this wasn't safe, but the rest of me told me to live for the moment, to enjoy life as it comes, so you may as well invite it in. This storm called to me and me alone, I breathed

Little did I notice an approaching cloud. The sky was darkening, and eventually the cloud blocked out all light, and snuffed the beauty of the storm. Overnight the storm became something I worried about... the once attractive storm became cold, and eventually shunned me. I wept.

For a time I died. Not in a literal sense, and goes cold and rigid in the body. I died in a much more effective way, where one stops feeling, for the pain is so monumental, it blocks out all senses altogether. I died in a way where one stops functioning spiritually, because they simply don't want to. I became cold and rigid in the soul. I rusted, and eventually, I couldn't.

Eventually, to bring me back to life. And as I'm slowly revived by time and it's gentle hands, the rust falls away in gentle flecks that decorate the ground, breadcrumbs left behind, showing where I've been and the lessons I've learned.

The item covering my head was removed, I thought to myself as a smirk took form across my face.

I must have had a puzzled look to my face because he continued saying, “You don’t remember me, do you Mr. Toigo?” I shook my head, as I stared quizzically into his eyes. His grey eyes glared back at me with a look of resentment, yet his unshaven face held a devilish smile. 
    
“Then maybe you’ll remember my brother…” A picture was thrown onto my lap from one of the burly men to my right. A tall lamp stood directly behind him, and directly in front of me was the man with the familiar voice, sitting in a steel chair identical to my own. A single unmarked door stood behind him.

“Is that attitude in your voice?” Our fellow pedestrians engorged us in a circle about 40 feet in diameter, my fists clenching in rage. “Let her go now you son of a bitch,” my voice stern and forceful.

The man I threw into the alley had regained his footing, abruptly stopping its progress. In one quick movement, I threw my entire body up under his arm, flipping his body over mine and directly onto the ground. I jumped on top of him and began punching furiously, blood splattering with each point of contact. He lifted his pelvis into the air, knocking me off balance as he simultaneously drove the knife into my thigh. 

I grunted as it entered my leg, seizing him into the air, leaving his feet dangling inches from the ground. I back-peddled into the alley, before quickly spinning and launching the man into the nearby dumpster. 
    
I backed into a parking meter as I watched the man attempt to regain his footing, I merely yelled as I felt an extreme amount of adrenaline course through my body. My body seemed to react on its own, turning towards the parking meter. With super-human strength I ripped it from the ground and threw it like a javelin directly at the man’s chest. I heard bones crack and saw blood spew from his mouth, but I wasn’t finished with him yet. He attempted to crawl away, but to no avail, as I walked towards him, my veins pulsing with adrenaline. My hands grasped the parking meter as I brought it down upon his back. Both his spine and the parking meter shattered and I could all but see him struggling just to stay alive
    
I threw away my weapon, but I just said with a forceful tone, “I warned you, you son of a bitch.” With all of my strength I smashed his head into the wall, and upon impact I felt his skull crush in my hands. He was gone.

The really sad thing was

They had met in a book club meeting, still painfully shy, and he was the first one who said hi to her. There were only ten people in the club, and she slowly relaxed around them. They argued over their favorite novels, had contests to see who could read the next assigned book the fastest and made up a secret handshake that, when they tried to perform it in the hallways between classes, always ended in loud laughter.

He had been in three of her classes, she was so excited, and terrified. She had never had a boyfriend before. Was she supposed to act different around him now? Was she supposed to stop hanging out with him as much? How many texts a day were too many? She didn't worry for too long. He was just as nervous as she was. They spent almost every moment together, those first two years.

Then junior year rolled around and he became distant. He tried to make an effort to stay cheerful around her

She had wondered if he was going to break up with her, she turned and looked at him, her eyes filling with angry tears and demanded that he just do it already. She couldn't handle this anymore.

He hugged her, maybe four.

They had cried together, because she didn't know how to handle it. But she decided that she would keep him happy for the next three months. He would never have to worry about her leaving him.

Those three months were the worst. He got weaker. He got more emotional. He would lash out for no apparent reason and once, and he called her that night, sobbing and apologizing. She went back to his house and spent the night lying next to him in bed, unable to sleep, listening to his mom cry in the living room.

The phone rang. She answered it on the third ring.

""He wants to see you.""

She was silent for a few moments. ""I can't. I can't do that.""

""Stop being selfish. I don't care if it scars you for life

She hung up and got out of bed. She brushed her hair and put it up, and smelled like it was about to rain. The woman at the front desk directed her to the right room and she went, trying to get lost along the way. It didn't work. The building was too small.

She opened the door marked 318 and everyone in the room turned to stare at her. His mother and father were there. His mother glared at her, looking exhausted. And there he was, sitting up in bed, grinning at her.

His father ushered everyone else out of the room to give them privacy. As the door closed

""Hey.""

He kissed her hand and she smiled. ""Hi. I'm glad you came.""

""Of course I came."" She felt like crying

He laughed, you're still here. That means the world to me. I love you.""

""I love you too."" The lie tasted bitter, until he finally closed his eyes and went.

She felt suddenly as if someone had reached into her chest and pricked her heart, found an okay job, and started dating her next door neighbor. He was an alcoholic, which she didn't mind. He hit her sometimes. She just covered it up with make-up and he never remembered the next morning. He proposed to her and she agreed. They had three children and she quit her job.

She wasn't happy. She hated the children. She hated her husband. She blamed it all on him

She sent the kids off to school, and decided to go for a walk. She kept walking, until she was so sore that she had to stop. She sat down on the side of a road she didn't recognize and smiled to herself, thinking that she had finally managed to get lost.",,False,,False,t3_uiwn2

Those words ran through Charlie's head constantly. The worst part was that the words came from a girl at work. A cute one at that. The way she said it made Charlie wonder if she actually cared for his well being or that negativity was her pet peeve. It wasn't his fault he saw the world in different colours. Then again....

They both stood idley. Charlie was about to start his shift

“I want to see you more happy man."" She said again. Charlie nodded and smiled. He wasn't sure if he was blushing or not

So he chucked that thought aside like a crumpled peice of paper entering a garbage can. “This is who I am."" he said to himself. Sure he had his happy moments

Charlie gazed at the girl as she left to  see her boyfriend at home. Then he looked at his arm which showed visible scars of self mutilation. “Who would want me anyways...."" he said as he turned back into the store.

***House of Ypres***

Everything was falling apart; the walls were melting, and staring at the destroyed surroundings that vaguely resembled the life I had just yesterday. However fate was cruel, and so were the Angels.

As I sat there on the verge of tears there was a noise. It was a soft


Maybe I shouldn’t say it started *again*. This noise was so completely different than the soft cries I heard just moments ago. This sound was terrifying and ear-piercing, urgent sound became obvious. I rushed over to a pile of wood that had somehow managed to escape unburned, but torn beyond repair. I moved the top wooden plank and a bright lighted shined up at my unsuspecting face.


This light was violet and warm. It reminded me of the caring embrace of a loved family member after not having seen each other for a long period of time.
     

“What in the world…” I trailed off as the light shone brighter and started to move. It began to stir and shift as if it were some living creature that the light had created, and when it was completely free it jumped off of the pile of rubble and sat on the packed dirt. It looked at me simply, as if it hadn’t just come out of a floating ball of purple light. I turned my attention back to the light – and rightly so for it began to move, rising upwards until it was at eye level with me. Out of nowhere, and without any warning signs, the light flared up to what I had to assume was full brightness, and then started fading until it had fully disappeared.
     

Totally stunned and unsure of how to proceed
     

I walked through a puddle, and when I came to a stop, the dust settled.
     

“What do you want from me
     

I had to stop, something to scream at. *I just need someone to tell me that this feeling won’t last forever and that things will go back to normal soon*, I thought.
     

“So basically you want someone to lie to you
     

“That’s not what I mea—” I stopped abruptly. That cat just *responded* to me. What’s more
     

“Oh stop being a wuss
     

My head was spinning out of control; I had lost my tongue
     

“What’s wrong?” Sinister asked chuckling to herself. “Cat got your tongue?”
     

Somehow that tasteless joke was what triggered my body to start again
     

“I’m dreaming
     

“Oh, “A dream? That’s so cliché. No dear, I’m real, and so are the Angels who sent me.”
     

“Angels?” my head perked up. Finally something familiar, I thought angrily.
     

“No,” she shook her head furiously. “You better be careful what you think dear, they hear it all.”
     

I turned and started walking again. I didn’t care what ‘they’ heard
     

“The Angels who sent me are the real Angels
     

For the umpteenth time today I was completely lost. The real Angels? There’s only one group of Angels, so why did I suddenly doubt what I knew? I sat down on the hard ground and leaned on the side of a house that now, literally, only had one side.
     

“Listen,” she said quickly, obviously taking advantage of the doubt that she most definitely read in my thoughts. “I came out of it but I’m not the only thing it was carrying. They gave you a gift.”
     

“No,” I threw back at her.
    

“They gave you an *intelligent*,” she corrected. “And that’s not all they gave you. I said the light was power, don’t you want to know where that power disappeared to?”
     

I didn’t. I really didn’t want to know any more than I already did. This was far too much for me to handle alone – but who would I tell? Nothing was normal anymore
     

“Where did it go?” I asked
     

“The power went into you


I froze


At this the cat flicked her tail and gave me a smile that made me understand exactly why they called her Sinister

My brother and I had a tradition of spending every Saturday night at my grandmother's. Legos. Mystery Science Theater 3000. Breakfast. Yard Sales. It was kind of a big deal. Just the most fun. The next morning, and I enlisted my brother as a lookout.
 
What we discovered in my 60-year-old grandmother's closet can't be described using traditional vernacular. It was the holy grail of pornography. El Dorado. The joy that swept through us surely beared some semblance to the elation that the team discovering King Tut's tomb had felt. Over the course of two months, bitch. It was an entire closet of hardcore pornography. What was I to do?
 
I learned some really disturbing things about my grandmother from that experience. Memories that I can't erase. Aside from the fact that it was largely porn from the 70's and 80's, which I wanted no part of. I was weird. But not that weird. I don't judge. Hey, I'm into some weird stuff, too. Must be genetic. She was also holding a lot of interracial gems too which was curious because she'd always been, well, kind of a racist. In a really sweet, older lady kind of way though. So I started selling the porn I didn't want and gradually became the Larry Flynt of my middle school. I kind of made bank for a seventh grader with no vehicle or job, perpetuating a cycle of social exclusion.
 
On that infamous day in question, revealing his dirty, dirty source. Imagine that! It turns out to be the pale, chubby weirdo wearing shirts that are too big for him. I was being profiled, I'm sure of it. I was thrown to the academic wolves and forced to confess to my parents that I'd been smuggling interracial 70's hermaphrodite porn from my grandmother's trailer for months and peddling it during passing periods. That's a difficult one to live down. I should probably be on some kind of public listing for it, really. ",,,,

She stood, nothing ever made anybody hurt. It came boiling up inside her, a rage so intense she felt her heart was on fire, how could this happen to her?! Why was she the only one who seemed to have real emotions?


Two weeks before this moment, bumps and jolts until the train slid from one stop to the next, her stomach getting tighter with each rock of the carriage and nausea waving over her with each rise and fall of the tunnel. The approach into Mile End Station went on forever, what was supposed to last around one minute felt like an hour. When she stood up the waves of fear swept over her. She hesitated. James grabbed her hand and pulled her forward,
“Come on Val
She shook her head as though coming round from a trance
Breaking through the hordes the winter ice stung her eyes, petite body screamed,

 ‘YOU DON’T WANT TO DO THIS!’

The voice inside her drowning to a whisper when she saw the hospital. Her stomach tightened, became sinister and overwhelming.

‘THE ROYAL LONDON HOSPITAL’

Valerie didn’t want to do it, maybe it would happen, but James and she both knew that it wasn’t the truth. 

Inside there was a small coffee machine, it was as though they were segregated. All happy people to the left, all the sad to the right, and dead ahead the door, that hid the room she dreaded so much. She wanted to run away. Valerie sat in the waiting room feeling numb, she looked at James, he seemed so vulnerable yet so strong all at once, watching how his face held that fake smile

A smiley nurse walked out of the office behind her

“Mr and Mrs Slant?”
The optimism she heard in that nurse’s voice filled her with hope and she prayed to the very bottom of her heart that it was good news.

“I’m so sorry
Those three little words, Valerie thought to herself ‘well fuck your I’m so sorry, how would you know?’ 

In a single moment she had found out that she would never be a mother, or be able to laugh when her baby was sick down daddy’s shirt, even see her child go to school, talk to her teenager about relationships, or even wear a big floppy hat at her babies’ wedding.The news hit her full force as if somebody had repeatedly slapped her around the face.

Two days later

‘I can’t do this

Not even a sorry, he could do something about it and he had done just that, he’d left her on her own, to be a lonely spinster, baron and useless. 

That whole few days played over and over in her mind, but then again not so little, sister burst in.

“I’m going to Cornwall for a few days!” Annabelle squealed with excitement.

“That’s nice, she was certain her body language screamed that. Her little sister, ‘Annie’ as she called her rattled on and on about this village they used to go to on holiday.

“…and you’re coming with me. That’s final”

“Oh.” Out came standard replynumber two.

“Oh? What does that mean? are you coming or not?!” Annabelle asked

“Sure.” Standard Reply Number Three.

“You’ll come? I’m so excited we will have to get packing and then book a …” Annie went off again on a tangent, white walled, height of fashion, perfect little palace. Except it wasn’t a palace for Valerie any more, it was anything but that for her, she saw it more like a prison, or even a shrine

Drops of last night’s rain had frozen on my sleeping bag and cracked softly as I withdrew.  My fingers thawed on a bowl of half-blackened soup that tasted like coal and burnt plastic. Then we left


I was already scraping my feet against rock and climbing up towards the tree line by the time the orange ribbons cut the sky. I watched the day rise slowly up from behind the white-tipped mountains. It was giving me something I could look back on and say I had lived. The morning, and the whole wide world: they were all so strong just then. The cold made me burn hotter and faster and better and it made my breath curl into  vanishing clouds. My feet were ready to etch the memory of me onto this mountain.


The last green thing was a calm lake at the foot of a white and rocky mountain. It was the last innocent thing before the peak. We left a few things and then continued on. The trail we had followed disappeared into scree and so we followed the stream up. We stopped where the incline leveled out into a rocky bowl and filled a bottle with cold stream water. We treated it with a few drops of yellow, that sprouted timidly on the rocky ground around the river.


We hiked up through snow to the sharp ridge of the bowl. All around was an algae that turned the snow crimson when stepped on. I looked back on my footprints and saw they were scarlet. I felt as if I were walking on a thin film that had been cast to disguise a sea of blood. The soles of my shoes soon became blood red and so did my pants. We all looked like murderers.


 The next thing that lay between the peak and us was a narrow strip of snow that marked the end of the bowl and the beginning of the peak. On one side the snow sloped sharply down into the bowl. On the other was nothing except air and then distant trees and rock and ice-blue lakes far below. We stayed towards the bowl side because the side of the ridge facing the drop was likely hollowed out by the wind and melting snow. Even then


The peak was somewhere up a tower of jumbled-up rock. There was a path that led up and we followed it. The jumble narrowed in one spot and the path led to a ledge at the very edge of the rock jumble and there was a drop that would kill me if I fell. I had to cling to the rock with my feet in a six-inch-wide shelf and shuffle carefully along. I looked up as I was nearly to the end and there was a spider an inch from my hand. I do not know if it was deadly. It might have been. If I had been afraid of spiders


The peak came quickly after that. There was not much room, and write some bad poetry next to it. But I did write something true there. I wrote I am above, on a line by itself, and that rang true. I was strung up so that all the craftwork of the earth could be seen. Cold wind blew around me and I had left my warm clothes at the lake below, but it meant nothing more to me than any of the cold winds I remembered. It was as though I had already lived through it a long time ago.


The view had the clarity that comes after a rain, and all that was before me was mine now, mine and no one else's, because I was the only person alive, had only ever been the only person alive, and that feeling did not make me feel lonely or frightened, but instead young and filled with life that would never fade or dissipate but stay collected until the electric reservoir in my veins finally ran dry.

Baby Ray
Raymond was my little brother. We called him Baby Ray until he was old enough to tell us to shut up

Theodore was the coolest dog ever. He grew to mammoth proportions, but Theodore really was. Ray used to ride atop him like he was a horse, pulling his ears like they were reigns and screaming with laughter. I swear he understood English perfectly. We would ask him, “Where’s Mom?” and he’d lead us right to her. It even seemed like he understood the jokes we made, howling along with my brother and I as we laughed at whatever stupid joke the other had made. 

Walking Theodore was considered to be a “chore”, we’d smoke and take him off the leash. While we lazily strolled around the woods, Theodore would run ahead. He never went far though, always waiting for us and staying within eyesight. Whenever we got a bit too baked and got lost, he always could smell his way back to the car. That dog was awesome, and we loved him like he was a long, lost third brother. 

I was 16 the day that Theodore died. I was playing my favorite video game, when I heard a scream coming from the front yard. My mom was out there gardening, and I knew there was nothing in the yard that could make her scream like that. I jumped off the couch and ran outside. Theodore was lying dead in the middle of the street. Apparently a car had whipped around the corner too fast and had hit him right in front of our house. He died right away. 

I was kneeling in the road next to his body before I realized that my mom was doing the same thing. Except she was kneeling next to my little brother

The way I felt about Theodore was pretty similar to the way I felt about Ray. Just the way Theodore was the best dog in the world, I often found myself going to him for advice. He was one of my best friends. 

That all changed after the accident. Ray had suffered brain damage and entered what the doctors called a “vegetative state”. This turned out to be permanent. 

Years went by. Ray made no improvements. He was a vegetable, who I had taught to shoot a basketball, was now breathing only with the help of machines. He would never walk again, or laugh, or do any of the cool shit we had always said we would. 

One day, and signified to us that something important was afoot. My brother had a whole slew of doctors that attended to him, but never had they all been together in the room at the same time. My mother and I were sitting next to my brother’s bed when they walked in, reading the newspaper to him. My mom believed that he could hear what was going on around him, and that he especially enjoyed the paper. When he woke up, she reasoned, he would want to be up on current events. 

“Excuse us, I refused. If there was something they had to say about Ray, then they could damn well say it in front of me. My mom agreed. “He can stay,” she told them, although they clearly weren’t happy about it, judging from the looks they shot each other. They kept it short and sweet. “Ray’s been with us for three years now, and he hasn’t shown any sign of improvement. He is in a permanent vegetative state

 My mom took this a lot better than I thought she would. It was because she fully held onto hope that my brother would one day wake up totally fine, that that would be the day my brother was sitting up in his bed waiting for her when she walked into his room. 

Every morning, she sat in that uncomfortable plastic chair next to Ray’s bed. Reading, talking, and praying for her empty shell of a son. Her life had turned into a constant observance of my brother’s horrible state. She was trapped in her refusal to accept the truth—that her baby Ray was gone. I had come to terms with the fact that my brother was basically dead, and I knew he would have accepted and agreed with that fact. I knew he would have hated what his “life” had become, and would not want to exist in such a way. I was able to move on with my life because of this. My mom couldn’t.

After a restless hour his aches and pains force him to drag himself from his bed and he slowly lumbers through his dark room, he looked very tired. He staggered back towards his computer no more awake than when he first he was first stirred more than an hour ago.

George briefly considered heading to his kitchen to make some food but paused when he thought he had heard his house-mates pottering about. He did not have the energy to face he rarely had the energy to face them. To call them house-mates was ludicrous because he hardly knew them and didn't have any desire to know them. They either were loud

George glanced towards his supply of weed a pile of about two grams sat in a small metal tin. He would have to try and contact his dealer soon

Smoking made George feel almost normal again and indeed soon after finishing his smoke he headed for the kitchen ready to face anyone who might be there. He strode quickly and confidently towards the door not even pausing to listen for his house-mates. Once he left the room his confidence seemed to slip and the relief was evident on his face when he found the kitchen to be dark and empty.

It's rough... Thanks so much!

Popping a crisp, catching the attention of a dozing cactus that probably could have used a few more minutes of sleep.  A dazed lizard rolled over and punched his alarm clock, grabbing his slippers he rose just long enough to bop the ‘pre-heat’ button on the desert thermostat preparing the desert oven for another scorching, hot day.  This lizard had been in charge of turning on heating the desert for years and couldn’t remember a day when they just left it off, slept in, and skipped the 117 degrees; but who was he to argue with tradition?

Humming past Mr. Saguaro and Mr. Gecko exchanging familiar glances

This is the story of a man with a woman’s name and a woman with a woman’s name.  They are both average people, they sure wouldn’t go see it!  But I still can’t help but dream of the poster, a huge slab of inked up tree bark, hung in a crowded mall surrounded by thick glass with tiny light bulbs twinkling around the edge. On said poster an uglied-up Johnny Depp would be crouched over a 1980 Honda CX 500 and a deliciously humble-looking Reese Witherspoon seated on the back of this sputtering bike.  With her arms wrapped around him, she hopes he knows where he’s going and wonders if this thing has breaks.  The cactus, Mr. Saguaro, in the desert background that they appear to be speeding though, written in the same muted grey color (TITLE OF SAID FILM)

As he pulled into a Denny’s, swung his leg over the bike, and knocked the kickstand down with the grace of a man who had driven through the desert for most of the night.

You see, for a woman, he is not the who this story is about.  He sought a catalyst to break him into greatness and he is a great candidate for a great American coming-of-age novel. This story however is really is more about a girl by the name of Amber.  

An extremely predictable girl by all appearances, and never went above herself to make any lasting effect on anyone.  However humble, Amber did have one particular quality that I began to sense more and more as I created her: though moderately predictable, she walked a cliff in her mind; most of us do.  But she occupied this rift day in and day out, she had even invested in a yellow lawn chair during a clearance sale and set up camp next to this psychological crevice, complete with ice-chest and umbrella, periodically peeking over to see if the bottom was any clearer.  Everyone has one, a piece of them that if looked at deep enough and long enough will send them inching closer and closer toward the edge

Ever since she was a little girl she had teetered on this edge, that she could barely catch sight of.  Today was the day though, and as an unsuspecting Lauren walked into the desert diner, with a tinkle of a bell and a thud of the door, he shocked poor Amber over the edge.  

Leafing through a David Foster Wallace book, the conditions in her mind were translucent enough to make out most of the ledge down below she thought as she leaned further than she could ever remember. Startled by the man’s “hello,” his simple greeting finally sent her toppling over, though she wouldn’t realize this until much later on the back of a motorcycle on its way toward San Francisco.  And after all those years of wondering what was down there, she began to have second thoughts. 
  
But in the spirit of a good story, Johnny Depp and Reese Whitherspoon would have been scouring the streets for work, looking rather humble themselves.  But this scene wasn’t a movie yet, it was taking place in real time and real space, and these two things have a way of making even the most mediocre moments pop, and as we know, they too have a way of sending girls toppling over the edges of cliffs.  

“Hi.., or if maybe he could just slip past her and ask the cook to crack a couple eggs for him as he poured his own coffee.  “Oh! Hello, sorry I was a bit absorbed...we don’t usually get customers this early,” she said with a sleepy smile.  “If you want to come right this way I can seat you in a booth right over here.  Is it okay if I put you next to the kitchen?”  He nodded.  “I suppose I should have asked if it was just you today or if someone else will be joining you,” though they both knew the answer to that question.  She handed him a laminated menu and guessed that he wanted a cup of coffee, smiling.  He looked up and cracked a similar, tired smile sighing,” she perked up.  Lauren noticed arresting stare and her focused

**The Fence**

When my Dad was a kid

So my Dad and my Grandpa drive an hour out of the city to one of the places that they used to frequently hunt. They get there

Not far from where they were hunting they drive past a large cattle farm. Without saying a word my Grandpa slows down

My Grandpa throws the gun in the back. Shuts the car off and runs around to the rear of it and opens the trunk. He runs by my Dad sitting in the passenger seat

My Dad holds down the barbed wire and long-legged Grandpa easily steps over it. As my Grandpa gets over the fence

A shotgun blast rings out from the farmhouse as my Grandpa nears the fence

Another shotgun blast rings out a little closer this time and now my Grandpa decides that he needs to get over that fence more than he needs the calf. He instructs my Dad to just drop the calf and help him back over the fence. 

My Grandpa gets back over the fence and both him and my Dad scramble back to the car slam the trunk

At this point my Grandpa informs my Dad that they won't be going home

As they approach

When they got home it was well past midnight. My Grandpa's clothes were soaked in blood and he was still bleeding from his run in with the fence. So as not to alert my Grandma

He doesn’t have my capacity, so he uses fire as his tool. It’s crude but it works. Why, just recently he managed to rid society of a bartender who was a serial rapist. I’m much more dedicated however. I take out the real sickos. Like you. And Other Noah will dispose of your body. You pretend to kill only bad people, but I know that! People like you
My cheeks were so cold. I couldn’t believe it. How did he know all this? 
I knew I was going to die. I began to say an Our Father.
“YES. This reaction. I love it!” Noah/Bellua bellowed, I love it! But why bother praying to God now? I control your life now: I am your God. Pray to me!”
I said nothing. Noah/Bellua began to pace
“What?” I said.
“Squares!” He murmured a little louder
I realized what he was doing: getting ready to kill me. Finally,  and gave up.

SLAM! 

Ken Hagen awoke in a cold clammy sweat, he traveled from place to place by boxcar, riding the rails like a ghost. He floated through towns an apparition, once he was gone no one was really sure if he had existed at all. He went by many names: Kenneth Hague, Kent Higgins, Kimbo Von Hindquarters to name a few. His breast pocket bulged with writing utensils. He had a pen for every occasion, blue ink, red ink, semi-permanent and even an antique quill pen just in case. He carried a number two pencil

Sharpen knives and cure cancer. 

Curing cancer was of course his primary concern but he needed something to get his foot into people’s doors, he even considered settling down a few times when he came upon a sleepy town filled with fetching women and dull edges. But something always pressed him on. His destiny, he had come to realize was to kill cancer. 

Cancer had nearly killed Ken once upon a time, lentil soup, tabasco sauce, Pert Plus shampoo, and Steel Reserve. He awoke on the floor of his garage eighteen hours later and realized two things: His cancer was gone, and he had pooped his pants. 

A clean pair of shorts later Ken realized that he had stumbled upon an elixir with amazing curative properties. A true nectar of the gods. Over the next few weeks Ken perfected the mixture and soon he was ready to begin his quest. “No one’s gonna believe me”

So much time had passed since then, dashing into the bushes before anyone saw. He walked through a wooded area and wondered aloud “Do squirrels get cancer?”, they probably did he answered himself, they were just too primitive to understand it. Lucky them. 

Lucky, the list of every person in America that had cancer. How he got the list is so secret that not even the person who invented Ken Hagen knows how he got it. He just got it. Now he was checking his list like Santa, if only Ken could travel the world in a single night like Old St. Nick he could cure cancer in a day. “Fat Bastard”, Ken muttered to himself, the next person on his list was not far from here. Betsy LaRue was her name. 

Ken tapped a familiar rhythm “Shave and a haircut, and if two bits was a quarter then what was one bit? Twelve and a half cents? It didn’t matter, Ken didn’t even have that much. And what about. . . 

The door opened revealing Ms. LaRue, luckily Ken Hagen got there first. “Hello Ms. LaRue, my name is Charlie Lininger”, Ken said, pulling the fake name out of his ass. “Might I interest you in my utensil and cutlery sharpening services?” a smile crossed her lips and Ken realized that she had once been beautiful, and still was in a way. “Sure”, she said

That’s what they all say. 

She showed Ken to the kitchen, choppers, and knife sets all sold by Ron Popeil. Ken hated Ron Popeil. His products were all bullshit, Popeil claims his blades stay sharp for life which is only true if you’re talking about the life of a fruit fly. Ken often daydreamed while riding the rails about slicing Ron Popeil’s throat with one of his own knives while whispering into his ear as he gurgled his last breath “Set it and forget it, dick”. But sharpening these substandard knives was not what he was here to do. 

“Ms. LaRue, “I thought you were here to sharpen my knives”, she said. “I am, but I can also take away your cancer, I can fix you, if you’ll let me”. She slowly reached for the 32 piece RonCo knife set on the counter and said. “You’re crazy, get out of my house!”. Ken could only smile as he said “Ma’am, now just hear me out

“How can you possibly help me? I’ve got terminal cancer of the liver”, then you’ll still die but if it works. ..”. “I could live”, she said. Her hand withdrew from the knife set. 

Ken slowly poured the elixir into a mug with a picture of Snoopy on it, her upper lip curling at the acrid smell, “Are you sure this will work Mr. Lininger?” she asked. Ken placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder, “It worked on me”, he said. Without another thought she downed the entire mug and promptly slumped over in her chair. Ken gingerly lifted her up and carried her to the couch where she could rest comfortably. 

He pulled out his list, took a hot shower and left unceremoniously. He had a train to catch, and a hell of a lot more names on his list. 

Betsy LaRue woke up eighteen hours later and she realized two things: Her cancer was gone

But she couldn’t remember his name.

”Screw you fat ass.” Tom said immediately regretting what he said. George’s eyes bulged out of his head. “What the hell did you just say to me” George was now stomping closer and closer to Tom. “Fuck

“It’s about time you woke up, “What the hell is going on!” His vision began to tunnel as his nurse drew closer. She slipped something around his neck and give him a kiss on the mouth. “Good luck Tom, you’ll need it” He immediately passed out.

“Am I stuck in some sort of dream? I can’t be.” He thought as he finally came to. He quickly reached around his neck to reveal what the mystery woman left him. “What the hell?” It was a bight silver key with a ball on the end, jumping up head still pounding from the punch. He spotted a door down the hall with an exit sign. As he was stealthily making his way to the door he spotted his clothes on the chair next to him quickly grabbing them as quietly as possible. “What the hell is up with today?” he thought getting closer and closer to the door. The man with the gun was growing more angry, he let out a warning shot sending everyone into panic. Tom had finally reached the door, grabbed the handle and pulled with all his might, the door wouldn’t budge, it was locked. “Can this day get any worse.” he thought. Just then the glimmer from the key caught his eye. “Well it’s worth a try.” He thought as he took it off his neck and cupped it in his hand.

“Tom Keen!!” Tom turned around and froze like a deer in the headlights

Tom woke up in a sweat, He began smiling drawing it close to his bedroom door. “I want to go to Paris.” he said half jokingly. As soon as the key touched the door it flew open with the same bright light and in the blink of an eye Tom was standing only a few feet away from the Eiffel Tower. Tom then grew the biggest smile. “Today’s the day.”

**The Monster from Midtown**

I’m going to eat you

Hmm, can’t we save it until morning.

The monster was confused. Rawwwwwwrrrr he screamed.

Ughhh, thank you so much for taking me home from Alistair’s, God that man can sure throw a party.

The monster had done no such thing. In fact he had abducted her stumbling up from midtown at four in the morning. He raised his claws and bared his fangs. He was hungry. He hadn’t enjoyed a proper human in weeks.

Oblivious, here’s one. She crushed the pill up into a little line on the coffee table and snorted it with a twenty. Don’t look, I know it’s disgusting. God I’m sorry we had to meet like this, and I thought things were going so nicely at the bar. Well, this is me. We can talk about it in the morning ok? Promise.

She fell backwards onto the couch

This was horrible. The monster craved the taste of wriggling human. He prodded her with the tip of his claw. No response. He pounced up and down on the floor of the apartment. He hollered and beat his chest. Nothing. At last

He awoke to the sound of a blender. He groaned.

Hi sleepy head, that is so cool. These floors, my god, I would kill for these floors.

The monster rushed into the kitchen. I’m going to eat you

Oh, I wasn’t actually going to kill you for this place, although seriously, how’d you land such a nice pad? You must have killed somebody. It’s an absolute crime to have a place like this.

She peered at him from over the blender. Huh, have a smoothie with me. It’s got B vitamins and dried kelp for the hangover. And then I really must be going. Brunch with the girls today. I have to get down all the way to 11th and 5th Ave. God, can you imagine how long that will take?

He took the offered smoothie. It tasted like rotten seaweed. Rawwrrrr

You’re mad at me. Ok, this is going to be embarrassing, but I can’t even remember your name. I’m Cheryl, and you are?

The monster was stunned. No one had asked him for his name in over a hundred years. 

Frank

Well pleased to meetcha Frank, I like that. Call me up this week? Do you like mussels? I know a great place on 13th st. 

She placed her card on the counter. Ciao

Before Frank could finish deliberating whether to eat her or not

He lifted her card. Cheryl Baker. He didn’t recognize the name of her company. A number and note were scribbled on the back. This is my cell. Don’t be shy

Frank let out a dejected bellow. After some time

====

He called her up. He wasn’t exactly sure why. Well number one, there was something about her. She didn’t seem to mind that he was almost seven feet tall, covered in hair with sharp claws and fangs. It was a hard life being a monster with the torches and the slaying and the what not. Aside from other monsters (and he hated spending time with other monsters), no one had been nice to him in a very long time. 

I do miss being around someone nice. And, I can always eat her.

They went to the mussels place on 13th st. He gagged on the wine and spit it out all over the table. 

Hmm

She hated the way he dressed, I know it’s hard, but we’re not film majors at NYU anymore. You might be trying to make a statement, but it’s paralyzing being around you. Can you imagine the stares if I brought you to lunch with dad at the Union Club?

He relented. 

She took him to a tailor by the Park and had him measured for a set of nice suits. 

Honestly she said one day at brunch with the girls

Darling, dribbling mustard all down the front of his shirt. I told him right then and there to cancel our reservation. No need showing up if you’re going to look like you came straight from a baseball game in the Bronx!

Cheryl had already moved on in thought. I’m going to see if I can get his hair done

Did you not have the heart to tell him Grunge died in the 90s? Rachel mocked.

The stylist in SoHo lopped off his mane and insisted he put some smelly oils in the remaining locks. The suit jackets made him feel constricted and itchy. The wines at dinner tasted like spoiled fruit. He absolutely despised frisse salads.

Still

When he went out alone, almost human. 

He began to appreciate the finer things in life. He enrolled in a wine class to refine his palette and slowly graduated from buttery Chardonnays and fruit bomb Cabernets to more nuanced Brunellos and Petite Syrahs. He took up squash with Cheryl’s brother and dominated at the club. He read up on the newest exhibits at the Guggenheim and sharp underground plays opening off Broadway on the Upper West. For the first time in decades

Frank

We need to talk. I’m all for openness and I think you and I have done a good job of being open with one another so I think it’s healthy if I just clear the air. I’m seeing someone else.

Who

A nice guy I met down at a gallery in TriBeCa. You remember, could you blame me? I was disconsolate, I went alone and had a bunch of Sidecars and there he found me by the bar.

But why? Frank said.

Why? Why? Because it’s suffocating being around you lately Frank. You’ve changed. You used to be interesting, it’s not like I haven’t tried. I do so much for us, when was the last time you put anything into this relationships?

But my hair

Oh please, I liked the way you dressed before, it was so hip. You had style.

It was too much for Frank. Something snapped. He snatched Cheryl and crammed her down his throat whole. The waiter screamed

After picking the restaurant clean, what a fine meal.

Anyway enough of that

----

It was the year 250, all at once.

A man tunnels inside a mountain using his pickaxe as a woman bites in to a freshly baked bagel. The mountain fractures apart in to pieces that are sent to the coal power plant. The bagels finish baking and the warm smell fills the kitchen in the bakery. The miner coughs and feels slightly ill. The electricity from the coal plant is sold at a rate of 10.96¢/kW•h. The woman pays for the bagel. The baker paid the electricity bill and the woman’s hunger feels temporarily satisfied.

It’s there. The path the energy took. The miner, the bagel, the woman's satisfaction…you see it all. It’s at once obvious and yet mysteriously laden with hidden details.

You see beings, being trapped such a low-dimensional manner like that. Like a prisoner. Or an insect. Or perhaps Pac-Man, controlled by the joystick. How limited.” you think to yourself, as if there were anyone else to think it to.

It’s all twisting and folding, soaking in the richness of detail available in this oversized fractal. The biggest and smallest sizes have a difference of several hundred orders of magnitude, yet it seemed most humans only used a few of them. Silly humans.

You fly around and zoom and expand certain portions of time and space

The universe exploded in to existence at the start, it was a balmy 86 degree day in southern Florida as a few gentlemen went fishing in a boat one of them was still making loan payments on.

“A lot of them seem to take the game quite seriously, romantically grasping as if your hand holds were jacket lapels on the coat of a lover. There’s so much emotion and hurt and suffering and pain, while also harboring unbelievable joy, compassion, beauty, and peace. All more or less self-contained in this one object, what a marvel! 

You fly to a different place. The United States president gave a long awaited speech to millions of diversely-opinioned citizens while inside their bodies billions of glucose molecules metabolized as they processed the words rolled to them down the social hierarchy from above. The atoms the people were made of seemed to buzz with imprecise possibility

Then, like the rug was jerked out from under your feet or the chair accidentally leaned too far back. You were in freefall, away from what was familiar. It had been happening the whole time, but you had only just realized it was going on. You reach out to this thing in desperation, this giant marvelous complicated life-giving thing, and yet the metaphorical lapels slip from your fingers. It’s so pretty you want to look at it forever.

The pulling persists. It seems as though you have angered a strange form of gravity. There’s a sense of confusion and slight panic.

You cling on to this 4D network of form and ideas and lifestyles and meaning and values. You try so hard to keep it from leaving you. In the last moments you see a human

You are dying. Or you died. You remember now. It’s hard to tell which

The universe leaves your hands and you plummet away from it.

At that moment of letting go, and all was forgiven. All love and compassion, no divisions or walls. Not just this marvelously complex life-giving 4D thing either, but all the other things too. *All of them*. “Welcome back!” reality said to itself, to you.

You realized you had won the war

The coal miner exhaled the last puffs of poisonous carbon monoxide as he passed out from asphyxiation inside the mountain. “That bagel was delicious.” said the woman at another time and place. And she was right

The thinking at the time was that only those who showed a global and fundamental contribution to society (while still viewed through the ridiculously tinted lenses of the global elite of the era) were worthy of entering into such state.

The process was both incredibly complex and costly. As each Transport

Standalone, security and life support systems were essential to the longevity of each facility.

Additionally

These resources are the most sought after treasure of the new world.

After hundreds of years of human progress, as its now known.

Many Transporters have been found

They are the last bastion of hope for they alone have the reserves of precious materials needed to sustain life for the current generation.

[Metals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium#Production), seeds, weapons and minerals are all a part of each Transport 'Crop'.

One find can support a group or community for years alone based on the barter and renewable resource potentials in each Crop.

One transport, which he sought to cure his [genetic predisposition](http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/06/ff_sergeys_search/) for a certain disease, was so vast that the still powerful city-state in the western province of North America was able to be founded.

The resources of this individual were extraordinary, was rather gruesome and cold.

The security systems in each Transport Facility are biometric and very complex. They can only be accessed by a living

If the system, stress or serious injury to the Transport - they go into fail-safe. Which is to say they self [detonate](http://www.ripten.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/nuke-needs-to-be-bigger.jpg). Taking with them all resources, the Transport and the Seekers as well.

There have been many instances of this

The most active and successful Resuscitation Team (RT) have been the ironically named

The most conniving

LWG alone has been responsible for the resuscitation of more than 370Transports. Their group is currently the most powerful in the world. With their own city-state, advanced, safe world and that they would be allowed to stake part in a significant way now that they have been Transported.

They are fooled into releasing their resources

It is a hard world out there now

There is rumor of a vast facility of resources and Transports in an underground 'CITY' of the most elite Transports ever. A facility supposedly comprised of the [13](http://www.thewatcherfiles.com/bloodlines/introduction.htm) most powerful and rich bloodlines of people to have ever existed.

It is not known which continent this facility is on

While I cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you're personally responsible for the large pile of dog shit found on the driver's seat of my dad's station wagon

1) **Your family has three dogs**: two Sharpei's and a Pit Bull. This means you're the only person in the neighborhood with access to that much dog crap. Sure

You are the prime suspect. 

2) **You knew that my father never locked his car doors.** I'm almost certain that you overheard my mother yell to my father to ""lock the doors"" on several occasions. The first time she yelled because someone took her collection of Wheat Pennies from the coin tray (She had every year sans 1948 and 1949) and the second time because someone turned on all the switches so when Dad got in everything was supposed to go haywire. But all that really happened was that the wipers started going

Although my father's typical response to mom was that no person in their right mind would try to steal a 1984 Colt vista with a wooden bumper

3) **You were mad at my family** because my mother said you couldn't stay for dinner on Tuesday. We were having cornbread with ham &amp; 1000 bean soup

4) **The shit had corn bits in it.** Everyone in the neighborhood knows that your family feed pets table scraps

My father's reaction wasn't pleasant and his first order of business was to harangue me and my brother in to confessing who did it, Mom, with a cynical smirk on her otherwise angelic face, shook her head at him and made the motion of a key being inserted in to a lock and turned. It was barbaric!

Because we're too poor to keep a set of latex gloves readily available

Dad is a salesman and because he doesn't have many material things (like latex gloves), and refuses to fold his socks -- rather stacks them supine in the drawer ""so they don't wrinkle.""

He refused to clean shit or drive the car while wearing his business slacks.

This led me to explain to Mrs. Kringle that morning why my father was pantsless on the sidewalk beside a pile of shit. She's a godly old woman and it was hard to explain, I've seen such evil things."" Dumb old bitch.

Although it's been weeks since the incident, my mother rolls up the windows and locks the doors at night for fear of a repeat incident. Dad asked why she can't leave a crack in the windows so the car can aerate. ""Not like they're going to squeeze dog shit through that little crevice!"" he said. 

""LANGUAGE!"" 

Every morning on the way to school the odor reminds me of a kennel and we leave a break of dog-dung aroma in our path. When I'm sitting in the back seat I can see other drivers faces contort and their heads swivel as they search for the culprit of this stench. ""Are we near a treatment plant?"" they must be asking.

Five minutes passed as I continued to brush her hair. Finally I broke the stillness and whispered to her. 
""Are you still afraid of me?"" I breathed.
A soft nod was all that she managed to show. That was the worst pain of all. I kissed her on the head as I got up to go but I felt her quiver upon the touch of my lips. It was difficult to get up and go to my car with my heart dragging me down the whole way. I still needed to get gas. Coming to see her before I left town again used the last of the gallon that I had. 

Before making it to the gas station I saw a trooper waiting with his lights on pointed towards the speed trap. He would find his man. Tonight it would not be me. My mother gave me her debit card to use for gas. We weren't extensively wealthy but she felt that if she didn't buy me gas I would stay at school across state. She enjoyed spending time with me so she would make sure I had a way to come see her. 

I reminded my mother of my father. Before he became self absorbed, I quickly shuffled it into my back pocket behind my wallet closest to my body. 

As I pumped gas I thought about the money I had saved. I was trying to buy this girl that I loved an engagement ring but she was incapable of just listening to me. I didn't need responses. All I ever really wanted was someone to just listen and make me feel like I was normal and I had normal problems with normal thoughts. 

Earlier in the night she yelled at me while I was trying to talk to her. 

""OKAY FINE. I UNDERSTAND. IT'S ALL MY FAULT THAT YOUR STUPID TOY WON'T WORK.""

""You're not listening to me. You're not listening to me. You're not listening to me. It's not your fault that 5 people are on Facebook at the same time. I'm just trying to tell you that I get stressed out that things only work when I'm alone with no one else around.""

I looked down and saw my fist clenched as I sat beside her. Why was it in a fist? In that instance I saw the consequences of a clinched fist. I saw her crying with bruises on her face. I saw my head splattered on the floor as her father battered me with his college bat. I saw all the paths that a fist would lead me and rushed back to the noise of the present and watched my hands relax. 

As I drove home I pondered these things in my heart. How could I confidently marry anyone at this point. Especially someone who was afraid of me. Afraid of what I'd do. Couldn't do. Never do. Could never do to her. 

I saw the lights of a truck hurrying up behind me. It was late and must kids had curfews to meet. He sped up and passed. Either he didn't know about the stop sign or he didn't care that it was coming up. The truck continued at the same pace through the intersection. At the same moment a tractor trailer was passing through the intersection. 

The sound was blood curdling as I saw the truck get ripped to shreds. The mass slid 60 yards before coming to a halt. The truck cab was caved to the floor. The driver was killed instantly.

1376727258.0,1kjhuj,The Gift Bag,khud44,2,0,0,"Jerry Chavez hardly ever said a word. A damn shame because he knew so many good ones. Lascivious

 

Escube:  to get ready for the day at work or a night out on the town by  shitting

(hygienically speaking the best order to perform them in).

Potanic: any item possessing the potency of Titanic proportions.

 

Yet, double-fuck, cock, bitch, hell, that 'c' word, Jesus

Jerry would spend most of his time creating the most wonderful worlds. Staying alive it might seem only to live in his daydreams. That was until the gift bag came.

Jerry,” he thought. Jerry looked at his watch. “No, much too cold to be my birthday.” Truly placing a temperature gauge on a watch is a brilliant idea, you are able to see how cold it is outside which helps you to realize if you have dressed appropriately. Or in this case it helped Jerry realize that this present was too early or much too late for his July birthday. Without a reason for the gift bag coming to mind Jerry still took it into his somnolently decorated apartment. Jerry was never one to look a gift horse in the mouth, mainly because the giving of horses as presents seemed to have fallen out of fashion. At least that is in the circles Jerry ran in. Although the only circles Jerry ran in was down at the high school. But this was not a horse track. And obviously it's not the right track for getting a horse either. But I digress, actually looking back on how long that tangent was it would be more appropriate to say I trigressed or even quadgressed. 

Jerry in the meantime had grabbed himself a beer and sat down on his couch with the gift bag. He said something to himself which I intend was “Go for it you pussy.” and then he opened the gift bag. The first thing he found was what seemed to be a normal everyday yellow, with which one would assume was to be written in with the pencil. The card followed. Jerry opened it with no haste, and read only this:

What you write with this Pencil into this Journal will come

true in that you will be able to fully participate in it so long

as you pop one of those Purple Pills.

Jerry daunted but determined checked the back of the card. Exactly as he thought

Jerry removed the magic lid from the magic bottle, why not.” and then swallowed the pill with the help of a swig from his beer bottle.

Its taste was not bad. Jerry now felt he had done something wrong. Maybe

It was a very good story. In the vein of Rip Van Winkle. A young lad, but for all. When the young man awoke he found himself on top of the hill looking down though on an unfamiliar city. He came down from his mount and walked around this new and as he found better city. Being quite confused he rested on a park bench. An old man seeing this unnerved young man sat down beside him hoping he could assuage the youth's pain. Jerry told him about the world he came from and how happy and surprised he was to see this one. Jerry asked how it became such and how it maintained its wonderfulness. The old man, who was quite knowledgeable, told him the story. He told the version that was not too long to allow the listener to become uninterested and not too short as to leave anything of importance out.

“To where?” Jerry replied.

“Home.” said the old man. Jerry paused. He believed senility had finally caught up to the old man. 

“I have no home here.”

This made the old man smile making Jerry now certain of the old man's brain being gone. The old man said

Upon hearing this Jerry knew what he must do. He would return to his dystopian world and share this gift

As great as this would have been you must already know that this is not what happened. Our world has no magic pencil or magic paper. Neither does it have magic pills. Just regular pills which purpose is to help. The kind you might get after an appointment with a psychiatrist. Pencils and journals with which we can write our feelings and thoughts in and one day share with others.

Ask this once and you get a confident answer. Ask again: a confused answer. Ask three times and you'll be doubting their answer.


But just ask again and they start to doubt their own answer.


""Are you sure?""

No. I'm not sure. Not any more.


Ask this every time and they'll doubt all of their answers


So ask for confirmation. Go ahead and ask if they're sure


That's how you destroy a person's confidence.


A question at a time


Because opinions are doubtful. How dare they say something they feel!


No more ""I think""s


How dare they think.


You think you have paid the bills


They can't answer the question with their thoughts


But it's not just the words they say that they're unsure of. It's the very act of living they suddenly forgot is theirs.


You took it from them.


Are they sure that they have their wallet?


No. That hefty lead-weight in their back right pocket wasn't confirmation enough.

No. The fat wallet pulling their jeans uncomfortably taut can't possibly confirm it's there.


So no


It should be there. They're not sure about that


But now they don't know if they have their car keys


So they look.


They check. Every damned time


They're not sure of what they're saying any more. Why are their thoughts no longer theirs?


They're no longer sure if they can live a day without forgetting something.


But they weren't ever inherently forgetful or unsure.


No


Because you had to know.

No

1376567185.0,1kevor,Shine,blue-leviathan,3,2,0,"my life seems to be in a perpetual state of crumbling decay. I sometimes wander to safe, lackluster coating. Even the sun once warming rays seem to just push me away

I wish I could say I wasn’t always this way. I wish I could point to the time, my life seems to be haunted by this slow decay. My only rest came from escapes to other worlds through various medias. Movies were the first. I could get lost in the action on the screen, the issues the actors had became my issues. But the illusion would always end quickly and abruptly. And soon after the same state of depression would settle in, only to remind me that my life and world will never be like the one I just experienced. About the same time as I was getting into movies, I picked up reading and video games. This also helped to transport me to new and exciting worlds that haven’t been corrupted by my presence. Books in a series became a drug. I would read one book after another, faster and faster, trying to experience so much of this new world that it might hopefully drown the one I currently exist in. Waiting for the next one to be released was hell. I would try to read ones I had already finished, but it would be in a world that I create

The author had unknowingly and unintentionally sent me to hell. I tried to reconcile by watching new movies, I gave all to save all. Sure, it was just my video game avatar that died. But it took what feels like the rest of my soul with it. The end of that series took away good friends. Friends that I could always talk to. A best friend that followed me through thick and thin. A significant other that always wanted me safe. And all of it was wiped away. It took away such a huge part of me that I refused to believe that it actually happened. That there was some, secret ending that revealed another game was coming out.

But it never came. My hero died, to video game, trying to capture what I know I once felt. But the corrosion always seems to arrive the moment I land on some other world. It’s maddening. I’ve been contemplating of other actions that can numb my mind to what's around me, but I know these methods will only bring me back to the same place I started, or someplace worse. But I still don’t want to die. At least I don’t think so. I have noticed that I made a rather frightening purchase a while ago. I bought a pistol. Impulse. I had no intention of buying it, but for some reason I was drawn to it. Something about how the metal’s hint of shine. A shine that reminded me of a place I had been before. A part of my life that was once filled with such hope. It felt natural in my hands. Not too heavy, but definitely sturdy enough for heavy use.

I bought it and a case of ammo. Like all new things I buy, bringing only one magazine with me into my home. Fast forward a few days. I was having trouble sleeping one night, so I decided to go for a drive. I drove for a few hours out to the middle of nowhere. I had a blanket in the back for emergency purposes, but decided to pull it out, lay on the ground, and watch the stars. And there it was. The cold black metal slightly reflecting the interior car lights. I grabbed the handgun, the reason I told myself that an animal might attack me and I don’t want to die. So I layed there on the blanket, eyes to the sky. And gun still in hand.

I layed there in silence and without a thought for about an hour when I first noticed it. *I don’t want to die*. It was a phrase that I had said all my life. It was just something I would repeat in my head without any real reason for being said. But for the first time, shining with the light of the moon and stars. *“I DON'T WANT TO DIE.”*  The gun sat there. Tempting me with it’s shine, a shine I wanted so dearly in my life. Multiple thoughts were racing through my head at this point. Phrases “Do it! You deserve this rest! End your suffering!” coursed through my mind. Were these thoughts always there? Were they caused by my corrosive curse? Or were they the very thoughts that caused the pain I was in? ***“I DON’T WANT TO DIE!”*** The barrel felt cold, lifeless. And in one fell motion, I threw the gun away from myself. *“I don’t want to die... I don’t want to die...”* Sweating, I repeated the phrase over and over. *“I don’t want to die... I don’t want to die...”*

I drove home with the radio off that morning, placed the gun and magazines in the safe, and lost the key. I don’t know why I didn't just leave the gun. The bullet... well... I've made it safe. Pulled the primer and drained the powder through drilled holes on the side. Engraved my name in the copper, pulled a string through the new holes and made a necklace out of it. I could have died that night. This necklace helps me remember that I was stronger than that. This bullet was meant to end my life, but now I hope it gives me strength to keep it. It’s got a certain shine...  *“and I don’t want to die...”*

It’s been said that the Earth is resilient and that, and that although the course can seem amoral and even outright wicked at times, it is nature’s course nonetheless and that it exists in a plane above all questioning. But of course, no one said that. 


No one, he, (and he is certainly an accurate term to describe this embodiment of animalistic masculinity) was more concerned with removing the foreign, black, sticky thing that seemed to have a death-grip on his foot. The deer were likely to cross the same path they do at this time every day, and he had to be rid of all distractions, poised and ready to pounce. Sadly for our primal protagonist

Indeed the sun did return, and followed his instincts to the tallest rocks he could see. There, as he approached the peak of the stony mountain before him, did a figure enter his view. It was like him, with meat and bone and hair, but different too. This figure had strange bulges at the chest and in its eyes was a longing that he would have said felt like coming home, if he could remember how to say that or knew what a home was.

After many months of research and exploration, when we meet again I will delightfully tell you it's beautiful name. The tribe leader Caucunau allowed me to enter their sacred nest of the flower. they had raised the flower for 5 years and the shaman had estimated that its potency was at a near lethal dose. When the flower dies the shaman consumes it and speaks to the elders of times passed. Believe me Julius , if I was the type of man to steal the flower and run off into the night , my journey would have ended soon after my arrival. So I had to spend all these months looking for one in the wild.

This flower is a peculiar one, it had attached itself to the bottom of a fallen tree, and if it was not for its purple glow we would not have found it in that black void . We could not take its seeds and the shaman cut the flower in such a way that it could possibly survive while leaving me a lot to send to you. The tribe members assisting us confiscated our maps and blindfolded me and my two Mexican assistants and led us back to the village. This flower is so sacred to them that I believe they would burn the forrest down to protect it.

Julius this flower is my hearts gift to you. If I wasn't sure of its qualities I would not have trekked so far for so long. I know losing you brother took a toll on you unbearable to most men. How you are able to function is beyond me. I know the nights haunt you, although later in life I came to love him for his sophisticated passion for life and knowledge, as well as his never ending sense of hope and kindness.

I spoke with the shaman many nights

The last night I was in the village 

 1 Take the flower and let it soak in cold water for 3 hours

 2  mash and chop the flower into a finely cut mush.

 3 let it sun dry till complete dry

 4 Soak and redry for about 4 times

 5 Once dried 

 6 On a full stomach consume the water
 
 7 Over the periode of one hour smoke all three piles.

 8 Expect results within the second hour.

The shaman said to expect extreme colors and visions for an indefinite periode of time , the visions will sense your fears and you could spend a life time in the land of the dead. Then wake up a few hours later.

As you are reading this letter I am already on my way back to the states. I expect to hear all about your cosmic voyage once I return.

1375585625.0,1jntnr,Reflection,Soulturin,2,1,2,"Day 1

I wake in the morning, just for a few days, just so I can have some well-deserved time to myself. I think I deserve that much.

I dreamed of Jennifer last night. It was the best dream I have had in a long time, most likely, but who knows where?

After a good few hours lying in bed, I dare not let thoughts of work interrupt my stress-free holiday.

I make my way to the bathroom; I could really use a nice

I feel my heart begin to thrum in my chest, and my reflection stares back. In horror, I watch as my mouth utters the words ‘you did this, you son of a bitch’ and the words actually come out. My reflection pulls a gun from somewhere out of the frame and aims at the roof of its mouth. I pull the trigger.

I see my brains erupt from my skull

This isn't real.

It can’t be happening.

I close my eyes

Later that night, but the darkness that comes with sleep is illuminated by flames, and the light shines on a mass of faceless corpses.

Day 2

I wake up with a headache. My sleep was uneasy

I decide to make waffles for breakfast again, maybe I was still dreaming. Like any of it matters. I choke down some aspirin with breakfast and the pain in my head subsides somewhat, but it still lingers there, hidden away behind my eyes.

I know I’m going to have to go to the bathroom. It has to happen at some point. It might as well be now. I slowly open the door, but the room is warm, and just like that my anxiety is gone. Still; I haven’t forgotten the mirror hanging from the wall. I make the conscious decision not to look; I will not feed a delusion, or a hallucination, or whatever the hell it was. I turn on the shower and step in, letting the hot water smother me.

By the time I’m finished, maybe I should give her a call? It couldn't hurt, it might even help… No, I promised myself just a few days free of stress. Jennifer could wait a few more days.

I step out of the shower and unthinkingly look into the steamed up mirror. The image isn't clear, side to side. As the condensation clears, the image becomes more and more visible, and more and more grotesque. My face is puffy and disfigured, and purple, my eyes crusty with dried blood. There is bile dribbling from the corner of my swollen mouth and my lips are cracked and dry, the noose itself is digging into my neck and ripping at the flesh there, stained with my blood.

This isn't real. It CAN’T be real.

I smash my fist into the glass and hear it shatter before I feel the impact. I pull my fist back and throw it at the mirror again. I repeat the motion, panting, wheezing; breathless. My knuckles are bleeding, but I don’t feel any pain. I’m too in shock to feel any pain.

I manage to pull myself from the bathroom floor, but no-one answers. I try several more times, but in the end I just leave a message. I hope she calls back. I need her to call back.

Sleep. The nightmares are worse tonight. I can see the faces of the corpses now, and is wailing at full volume. The worst part? I can’t wake up. No matter how bad it gets. I cannot wake up. Please… I’m begging you. Let me wake up.

Day 3

Being able to open my eyes is a relief, I honestly cannot tell. I am struggling to tell if this is even reality at all, I am awake, but maybe my mind has lingered in the realm of dreams. More like nightmares.

I stumble to the kitchen, the sensation does not die. The thought of food repulses me. Even waffles makes me feel sick to the stomach, I know that if I even try to eat a bite I will immediately throw it back up. I try calling Jennifer again, but I only reach her answer message, where is she? I run my hands through my hair, I have a headache again, and my throat feels drier than it ever did. I grab myself a glass of water, although finding my mouth seems to be something of a challenge. The water helps moisten my throat

I don’t want to. But I know I have to… it is the only thing that could hold the answer to whatever is going on here, I know he will be waiting for me, like an old friend…

There is another mirror in the hallway. I will have to do it.

My reflection seems normal for a moment, spurting, shooting in every direction. My reflection stays standing still, as if nothing had ever happened. I return its dead stare. Then, I hear myself speak, with a rasping, guttural

“You did this to me- to us- to yourself.”

“How have I done this?”

“You cursed us.”

“I don’t understand

“You don’t remember, we feared death and so we sold our soul so that we could live, but you do not make a deal with the devil lightly, for he will always have the upper hand.”

“What do you mean?”

“You live a normal life until the moment you are most happy, that is when we appear, and we will not go away until you end it all. If you do not do so, things only get worse, the visions will grow more lifelike with every passing day, the earth will begin to tremble around you, all of your senses will betray you, and they will burn, once you have killed yourself

“I never wanted this!”

I see my dead eyes stare back at me with contempt. I realise that there is only one option. I call Jennifer one last time

“I’m sorry.”


I open my medicine cabinet and take all of the pills I have. I fill another glass with water and begin to swallow them, and look at my reflection. I am overwhelmed with self-pity, even though I know I don’t deserve any, and I begin to cry. But it doesn't last long. Soon, I can feel the room slipping away. I watch as my reflection begins frothing at the mouth, and I see my eyes roll to the back of my head. As I fall to the floor I embrace the cold arms of death and promise myself that in my next life I will remember, I will prepare myself for the worse, and that salvation is nothing but a fantasy.

Their branches brought to life by the wind seemed to reach for him with gruesomely long and slender fingers. The rain collecting in puddles and streaming along the fallen branches
   Steam rose from his wet skin as he was standing in the mucky water and listening for a prey. The constant shower of rain filled the air with a damp smell of mud and the sound of whispers from far away. Then he heard it. Something was out there… and it was his to play with. He closed his eyes and inhaled a deep breath opening his claw-like hands eager to drive them through his victim. 
   He crouched and leaned forward targeting the prey. He didn’t have that much problem seeing at night so he knew exactly where to go. He moved swiftly and without a sound like a shadow blending with the darkness. As he was getting closer he jumped over a large tree that had fallen long time ago and landed on his hands making a silent roll in the wet mud. Soon after he rose, running around bushes and occasionally tripping over various objects including her own feet.
   He paused to take a better look at what he was chasing and as he did his eyes brightened. If anybody had been looking his way
   Once he knew what he was up against he chose to sneak past the girl and attack from the front – face on. No grabbing by the leg or any other cowardly moves. It shouldn’t be too difficult, didn’t make a lot of noise and had a great night vision. The hunt was on.
   He picked up his pace maneuvering through the woods
   He should have closed his eyes before the girl saw them
   He flew past her so close he wiped off some rain drops from her cheek. As he went by he started to rotate and behind him formed a black cloud that covered his feet. And finally he had the chance to rip his pray to pieces. His claws grew longer right before they slashed the demonic flesh of the slithering beast that had been tormenting the girl and chasing her through the forest. The beast was stunned
   The girl was frozen with fear but she wanted to run. It was a fearsome feeling but she was amazed by the two creatures. The dark creature with flaming blue eyes floating around followed by a cloud of darkness blocking her from the growling beast whose breath turned into white smoke. 
   The beast roared once more sending chills down her spine and attacked the dark creature trying to pulverize him with its horns. As soon as they got close
   Blue-eyed turned to the girl and smiled. That was the creepiest smile she had ever seen for it was given by a skeleton rabbit with long slender ears and burning blue eyes. But she smiled back and the creature disappeared in the dark.

I raised my hand

*Harder.*

Fuck. I gave her a kiss

I rolled off and lay there, sliding closer. She pulled away.

*Why didn’t you hit me?*

Well here’s the thing. I’m not overly familiar with the process OK? I have normal sex. For normal people.

She scoffed

Hey

Slowly she climbed back into bed. I held her

Fucking hell she was pretty. Dark hair

I got up early, vigorously. Scrambled were her favourite. I finished up in the kitchen, grabbed the accoutrements and proceeded back to the bedroom. She was just stirring. I placed the eggs on the side of the bed and gave her a smile as her eyes opened. She smiled back.

This had never happened to me before. Years of repression

I remember meeting her at the train station. Her train arrived about a minute after mine. As I was organizing my bags I saw her walk through the station, permitted my flatteries. I took her for a beer, and kissed her within an hour of our meeting.

We did the dinners, like I’d courted other women. Then it became interesting.

*Tell me what you want.*

What I want? 

*What you want to do to me.*

Huh.

What did I want? I didn’t even know. Sex, basic requests, all of which she willfully obliged.  Then she started making requests. 

As a rule I don’t strike, and a miserable practitioner. 

There was the hair pulling. I gripped it feebly

*Choke me.*

Uh.

*Just do it.*

I placed my hand on her throat

*What?*

I can’t.

*Oh.*

We fucked in silence. She left soon after. I lit a cigarette and went for a walk.  Cigarettes do me such good. 

This was so strange, booze. Christ I actually liked this girl. Why was I so incapable of pleasuring her? I didn’t understand this masochistic bullshit. I lit another cigarette. 

There seems to me something inherently paradoxical about the desire to be so-called ‘submissive’ during coital engagements. She held all the cards. My inability to satisfy her left me a sort of sexual plebeian. A lower caste of lover.  She was my ‘dom’ in every sense.

She went to Toronto for the weekend. Our texts had been vapid and terse for some time. I spent the weekend drinking heavily, sometimes she even texted back. 

I resolved that

*Hey.*

Hey

*Good. Listen

Oh? 

*Yeah. It won’t be the last time either.*

Oh.

I turned off my phone and went for a walk. The cigarette tasted like dirt in my mouth. I had never had any pretentions of exclusivity; still, strip naked and fornicate in a prescribed and formulaic way. I’d go home alone.

They say vanilla is the finest of the flavours. Light, never exciting.

She looked at him quizzically. He had changed in the short period of time they had come to know each other. When she first met him, hunched over on the leather armchair with his slender arms outstretched towards her and his long fingers wrapped around her hand. 

A smile grew on her face. 

“Let me show you something.” 

She lifted her left hand out of his and slowly worked the ring off her middle finger. He looked at her gentle face with confusion as she slipped the ring onto the middle finger of her other hand.

Freedom.


Something I loved died that night.

What is death? An eternal rest? The end of the life of a person or an organism? No. Death is freedom. We live in a treacherous world filled with corrupt men and murderers who wander the streets at will with a blatant disregard for others. People are disgusting creatures. The people I love are carefully selected from this group of traitorous humans, that you’ve made their life a happier place. I’m a person who doesn’t love easily, but I think I’ve found it. There’s a feeling inside me that I’ve only felt once before. That feeling of the pet that listened, the mouse who cared. Now, I’m certainly not comparing Marie to a mouse, I’m just saying that they’re the only things that I’ve loved in my 23 years on this planet. Marie is beautiful, caring and thoughtful. She’s also the only person to ever look beyond my chipped crust of insecurities. It seems as though pain or suffering has never graced the presence of my perfect Marie. Which is nice to know that she was cared for. That she had friends. That she had parents who were home. That she was loved. 


Anger.
Pain.
Freedom.


Marie is always happy, she tells me that her father is ill with a rare type of cancer. I stare off into the distance pondering this painful news. She says he’ll fight it the best he humanly can. Why? I think. Sickness is normal, no matter it being mild or severe. Why fight a deadly illness and not be around the ones you love when you can just accept it and live your life to the fullest with the designated amount of time you have left? Everyone has to die anyways. Young, old, male, female. Everyone and everything must die on this earth. So why attempt to prolong it for a few more tedious, painful years? 


Just be free from it. 

	
I invited Marie into my small apartment, the pain of a family member dying. She wishes her father was better, she wishes she wouldn’t be sad. The pain is too much for her. 


She wants to be free.


I go into my kitchen, but promote freedom, release pain. I walk out of the kitchen and into the living room, where I see my perfect, beautiful, loving Marie sitting with her eyes closed. Trying to shut the pain and fear away. I walk up behind her, my instrument of happiness clenched tight in my hand.

1374676143.0,1iyh1e,My First Short Story: Darkness,takamarou,2,0,1,"They say that darkness is the absence of light.  They make it sound as if darkness is something waiting to be filled - like an empty mug sitting next to a coffee pot.  They say this with all confidence, that they've never seen darkness like this.


This is darkness so complete that it seems to be both expanding infinitely


This, rather - on a raft in the middle of the ocean.  Now, James' story is not one of heroism or adventure.  He did not survive a plane crash; he did not dive in after his true love; he truly did not venture into the ocean with any sort of courage or valor.  James, the dear boy, simply needed to use the restroom.  


In order to celebrate their recent graduation, James grabbed an inner tube and hopped off the boat to do his business.  Perhaps due to the slightly large amount of alcohol, James' peers did not realize his poorly timed bathroom break, and decided it was time to head back to shore.  In retrospect it was certainly a comical scene; James floating there with that post-urination relieved look on his face, suddenly broken as he hears the engine roar behind his back.  What followed was a comical combination of thrashing, screaming, and - not one, among the thundering engine and the senseless joy aboard the boat


As day commonly does, weighed down with the exhaustion from screaming for some sort of rescue.  It was very much a fruitless act, but how can you blame him - what other sane response is there when stranded at sea?  In times of such hopelessness there is little room left in the brain for logical thinking.  Your mind is consumed - and our dear James can clearly attest to this - with one thing: rescue.  Of course, what else is there?  I surely doubt you would suggest for James to swim back to shore, or even less become some sort of floating nomad.  No - rescue is the only positive outcome that James can hope for.  So he screamed.


Now, not in a darkness so thick that he struggled to breathe.  By the morning he could have drifted any number of miles - ideally closer to shore, but seldom do these things turn out so well.  Fully convinced of his depravity, James set his mind on the fact that by next light his rescue would be impossible.  As this final realization sunk in for James, his mind raced again, for the fear of dying was much stronger than any exhaustion.


You'll find that when death becomes inevitable, even, he would become a ghost and could haunt those damn ""friends"" who left him at sea.  No matter the outcome that is death, it could not be as terrible as the worst parts of life.  I mean, you can't get stranded at sea when you're dead, right?


In fact, each more horrifying than the last.  The most obvious in James' situation, of course, being drowning.  How awful that would be - the overwhelming panic as you realize your life depends on another breath; the desperate gasp for air only being met with water; and the final moments when - goodness, that sounds awful.  Certainly there is a better way for James to go.  But what?  Starvation?  Spending long days slowly getting weaker and weaker until the breaks in hallucinations is your only grip on reality?  No, not that.  What about a shark - it would be quick and probably without warning; but no, the pain would be overwhelming - that wouldn't work either.


You see, and a calm final breath.  Outside of that, there is no enjoyable dying process - every thinkable option is too painful, or gruesome, or gross to even consider.  This, James found, was infinitely more exhausting than anything he had ever done in his life.  Being constantly terrorized by a new opportunity to die, drained every bit of life that he had left.  


This is where James made his ultimate revelation on dieing.  Dieing, though, comes from the lack of control.  Truly, drowning may not be so bad if he could make the decision to make that final fleeting gasp.  Starvation may not even be terrible if he could convince himself that the stomach pains will eventually subside.  The true fear of dying is not knowing - it's not knowing when, or how, or if it's going to happen.  Death is the only thing that no man has control over - we can choose to live closer or farther from death, but ultimately the time and method is not for us to decide.


James final resolution was to not give death this satisfaction.  He would not lie down and let death decide his end.  He would not live these last hours of his life in terror of death's creative process.  He would control this; he would decide his fate.  With that, and accept death as his inevitable end.  Overcome with the peace of knowing that he had control, James' finally drifted off to sleep.


He awoke to a familiar sound.  Yes, but it was neither of those.  It was faint, but pierced the calm air well enough that it could not be mistaken.  It was a boat; in fact, as it drew closer James realized that it was the very same boat that his friends had been captaining the previous day; they had come back.  With great relief, James reclaimed his wits and began another bout of screaming and thrashing to get the boat's attention.  Overcome with joy, James saw the boat turn towards him and confirm his rescue. As he was pulled aboard the boat James was quickly covered with towels to wipe away all that had come with his night at sea.  He ran the towel down his arms and legs, and felt with relief that he was wiping away the last remnants of the darkness that had clung to him the previous evening.


We see now that darkness is much more than just a space without light.  It is clearly more; darkness is a consuming force, morphs, and transforms the things we know, turning them into demons that haunt us through the night.  Our only anchor is faith that darkness will pass, and its plague on our perceptions will as well.  We rely on the assurance that when night passes, light will come to reveal that darkness only provided a skewed version of our hopeful reality.

Joseph, amid the beautiful views of rolling forests and rising mountains. It was he that stepped up and opened the door for me as I came to a stop in front of the one-story little house.
“Ma’am, in a slight country twang.
“Oh Joseph, grateful to see him once again after so many years. “Thank you so much for letting me come here and get a break from all that.” I waved at the horizon.
“No problem, it’s been getting pretty boring up here. A change in company should do fine for me, and who better then you?”
 I laughed
“Nah, she probably won’t even know you were ever here! Anyways, you must be mighty hungry, you look much too thin!”
We headed into his house, revealing a comfortable-looking cream colored sofa and a fireplace against the wall.
“Oh
“Yeah, the door crashed open and in came stumbling a tall and muscular man of around twenty-nine or so. 
“Hey, gave me a quick up-and-down glance, and continued: “You about ready to eat? I’m starvin’!”
“In a minute. Sam
“Nice to meet you
We all sat down to eat a delicious meal of cooked chicken and a salad of lettuce and slices of squash
“So what brings you to Crevenly Falls
“Not much

“Oh, is there, Joseph?”
“Nope
“It really is beautiful out here
We finished our meals in silence for the most part, and that it was best I go to sleep after my long trip. 
My bed was down a short hall right off the dining room. It featured a rather comfy looking bed and an absolutely gorgeous view of the mountains and the sunset. I soon slipped into my bra and panties and into the bed. Before I could get too comfortable though
“Who is it?” I yelled.
“It’s me
“The door’s unlocked, and seeing me under the covers, backed back out. “It’s ok,” I said, “I’m covered. What’s up?”
“Uh, we’re going down to the ahh… the creek,” he finally bursts out, clearly nervous about me being all but nude under the blankets. “And we were wondering if you wanted to come with us tomorrow?”
“Sure
“Umm
“What do you want
“Uh
“If you’re asking me if I have a boyfriend, and turned around, making it all too clear that I wanted to be alone now.

I woke to the sun blazing through the windows. Most of the day was spent eating and Joseph giving me a tour of the farm, etc. cetera. It was beautiful, nestled in a true no-man’s land.
When we finally left for the creek, before I left for college and my life in the city. The ride there was short, just a few minutes in Josephs truck and we were plunged into the dark woods, before they opened again to reveal a narrow strip of light illuminating the fast-flowing creek. 
Unlike the creeks that I knew growing up
“Oh
“It comes up from a hot spring, Sam, we’re here.”
Sam took this opportunity the show himself
“You guys ready for a swim?, revealing not only a rather tight swimsuit, but also a very muscular body and what could only be the shadow of pubic hairs at the waistline of his suit. But before I could get a proper eye-full, he turned and sprang into the water with the grace of an awkward puppy, splashing water everywhere.
I slipped off my clothes as well
“Umm, “I think this swimsuit is a little… small on me…”
“Don’t worry, chuckling to himself and Sam. I came out from behind the bushes.
“Oh wow, you look fine.” 
I got in the water
“Not really, anyways. The farm keeps me too busy, and it’s just boring coming out here on your own.”
“Don’t you ever take Molly down here?” I asked.
“Nahh
“Oh… I see, it makes a lot of sense now, with Molly being gone so much and Sam practically living with Joseph, there has to be some kind of gay thing happening around here.
But Sam asked if I had a boyfriend, in that masculine yet boyish way. And he really does have style, the pubes-revealing swimsuit that only a gay man can pull of points to that.
After several hours in the creek, skipping dinner and rather went straight to bed. 
That is, before heading back out towards Sam’s room. After knocking and not hearing a reply, I opened the door.
And caught him masturbating.
Like, gliding from head to base. When he saw me, he threw everything away and quickly shoved his dick back in his pants.
“Oh god
“Jesus, “You don’t have to be so embarrassed though, everyone jerks it out every now and then.” 
“N-no. I was just… I have dry skin and I need to keep it from cracking…”
“Oh, you don’t need to do that… I can help you out.”
“I can’t
“Joseph, and I’m cool with that. And Joseph isn’t here anyways…”
“I don’t know
“Oh shut up and take off your pants.”
Instead of him taking them off, for the briefs stayed on for less time than the pants did. It was then that I saw it all. A good 8 inches of flesh, rock hard and ending in a bush of reddish-blonde pubes that curled flowingly crack.
I stroked his cock, feeling his head and shaft slide down my throat and hearing him moan, the taste of lotion still lingering on his veiny man-root. His moans increased and he started to gyrate at the wastes in a climax before I took my mouth off his dick, teasing him one last time before sucking him off to the finish, his salty-sweet load of semen ejaculated into my mouth.
“Oh god… that was amazing
“Heh, before taking off my pants and guiding his head down to my shaven pussy. My body tensed up in pleasure when I felt his tongue and fingers pulsating against my clitoris, making me produce more moistness then I care to mention, making a dark patch on his sheets. 
And then he switched it up, every movement an overwhelming surge of ecstasy until his thrusts increased in tempo and I came all over the bed and gasped for air. 
“Now that
“Yeah

Working for the central intelligence agency is a lot easier than what most directors and writers would have you believe. Or maybe just my job is. Most of the CIA’s work now, but every now and again a plan has to be drawn up, a trigger has to be pulled, and a person must die. The man who makes this sequence happen, is me.

“Ah Nathan

Ericsson, Yokcasvich is already on his way to finalise a deal with the Italian mob”.   Yokcasvich!  I almost bang my fist at the name. Yokcasvich or the General, is a war criminal turned salesman. He used to be a high ranking Russian General until his war crimes were discovered during the Russian Middle Eastern war. Subsequently, he went underground and started his business of selling Russian military grade weapons on the black market to anyone who would buy. The man still commands respect and support from a number of Russian army personnel, which makes it easy for him to obtain his products. “The two men, Yokcasvich and the mob boss Dmitri, will be meeting in the woods roughly 50 miles north of San Francisco. There, we will make our move. “Hmm” kill two fools with one bullet

“I still think it’s a stupid and risky idea” said Harry, I’m willing to bet that it’s going to be another Blackhawk down except in America.” “Do you even know why Blackhawk down happened?” said I.  “Our Government’s obsession over oil, Nathan, clearly” Harry replied. “Really, count for me please, the number of oil rigs in Somalia”. “Zero”. “Exactly, Blackhawk down did not happen because of oil, a punch to the face would be much more effective”.

“Nathan, Nathan follow me”. I followed Ericsson out of the stuffy room and into the cool hall, not once taking my eyes off Harry. “Remind me again why he’s a part of this operation?” “Aw, he’s good with numbers, anyway that’s not important, have you got your team ready?” “Of course.” “And your equipment?” “Yes everything is set and ready.” “All right then operation Asgard is a go.

“Corporal Johnson reporting Sir” Johnson, no formalities here”. “It’s an honour to serve with you, sir”. “They all say that. Why?” “What, that it’s an honour to serve with you?” “No, why do they all say sir?” “The team is ready to move out on your orders. You’ll be riding in the rear jeep. All your equipment has already been loaded in”.

“Nathan”. It was Ericsson, a smile grew on my face. “More ready than you’ll ever be Eric, let’s move!” There was a sudden flurry of activity as 20 men loaded themselves into 5 jeeps. The satisfying click and bang of car doors opening and closing was becoming cliché. I knew finally, that we had reached the end game, three years and six dead agents later, it was finally time to cleanse the universe of their scum.

An hour’s drive through the Californian countryside later and we had reached our destination, I liked the way it balanced in my hand, the shoulder stock gently pressed against my shoulder and hand grip moulded to accommodate my hand only. The trees swayed gently in the cool summer breeze, I could hear the distant growl of an expensive car and the dust settled in front of our position. I was in the sniper state of mind, incredibly calm and focused before every shot, and that’s when I felt it, the cold hard steel of a gun barrel pressed against my neck

I knew before I even turned around to look at my killer “Harry”. “I’m afraid I can’t let you take that shot Nathan”. I looked over to Johnson, so I knew I had to act fast.

“Yokcasvich, of course, Yokcas and you the device?” “Right here”.

“Nathan, make the shot.” “Nathan take the shot!” My ear piece screamed at me, but no time to concentrate, Harry was faster and stronger than I had imagined… and… he.

“Wait boss, sorry Yokcas how much?” “500,000 euro, the dollar is not, how you say, as appealing as it used to be”. And you can assure me that it is military grade?” “I stake my reputation on it Dmitri”.

I… Slammed him against the jeep… and… pain… then… hit him across the face with my elbow… wait… how… punched him in the face… pushed me… on the ground… deafening sound… and then, Johnson had come to and shot Harry with the rifle. Harry slumped to the ground lifeless.

A shot rang out “What was that? Is this a set up?!” “I don’t know but I’m not waiting around to find out”. “Wait Yokcas, Dmitri pushed his way through his men as they jostled for a seat in the car. “Yokcas!” Dmitri marched up to Yokcasvich, grabbed his shoulder, turned him around and produced a glock. “Give me the device!” The time for games was over.

“Johnson, now was the time, I focused my lens, took a breath and pulled the trigger which ignited the firing cap, accelerating a 44gram copper and lead slug past the sound barrier and over 500 feet of rocky forest terrain and in between the shoulder blades of Dmitri.  The lifeless lump of metal wasn’t finished yet, it carried on into the forehead of Yokcasvich. The two men slumped against the car and slid down until they met the dusty forest floor.

I lowered my rifle and let a tree take my weight, John”. I waited there with Johnson as he was treated for his wound. Then, we continued to talk up there on the ridge, about the CIA, about Ireland my home country, until the sun went down, when we finally decided to get some rest so that we could fight another day.

 Once I traveled to the Great Summit in order that I may consult the Wise Man of the Mountain. The journey was long and treacherous, a man of great age stood in front of me, his face pounded with knowledge, for he was truly ancient and wise. We exchanged cordial greetings and for a short time, I sat and only watched him in awe of His vastness. Soon we began to talk and converse, and as we exchanged ideas and thoughts, I learned a great many things; Truths that would boggle even the most vivid imagination, I realized that He had wisdom and knowledge that one would expect only a God could have.

I returned with my prize to a friend’s barren apartment. The previous tenants had systematically extirpated the meager quarters, and the electricity had yet to be engaged. 

We began to drink. I wondered politely if there might be a mixer or a chase. He called me a pussy. I cracked the 26 oz bottle and suckled at it

It was her birthday tonight. I had driven almost two hours to sleep on the floor in a shit hole just to see her and go to her party. I didn’t know anyone there

I sucked at the bottle

We proceeded out of the dilapidated apartment. My belly was warm and the air was warm, and I reached into my back pocket for a damp bill which I passed forward. I exited the fusty vehicle, clutching my 2-6 and rang the doorbell before my buddy had even closed his door.

She answered

I went in the house and introduced myself to her roommates. They were pretty, the alpha. Literally taller. In the better program, from the better family. Beautiful. I took a powerful slug of whiskey, and smiled and laughed. I lifted and organized and joked with my buddy and drank more. As I was lifting the keg into an ice-filled tub, she came up behind me and touched my arm. Thanking me. I told her it was my pleasure and concealed my erection.

More friends of hers showed up. The girls went into a room and changed into shorter skirts. The men shook hands firmly and discussed drinking and other important things. I pulled away at my whiskey

The girls came out of their room shortly before a horde of guests arrived. The keg was tapped and the party began in earnest. She hurried between guests

But my buddy summoned me to a cramped room. Large men sweating and shouting. Cups askew on the table top. We played a game. I threw the ball disinterestedly across the table missing often. My buddy screamed obscenities and gesticulated wildly. We both drank frequently and lost the game. 

I had to sit down for a minute. She was smoking pot in the next room. I could hear her laughter. Had to collect my shit.
One of the players from the cramped room came out. He handed me a bottle of whiskey barbeque sauce and suggested I use it to chase. I dissented. My buddy came out. Don’t be a fucking pussy. Alright. I tilted the nearly empty bottle to my mouth and pulled long. I clutched for the sauce and tipped that to my mouth. People laughed. It tasted better with the sauce.

There she was. Coming at me. Man up. Hey how are you feeling. Real good. You’re really fucked eh. Nah I do this all the time. Drink some water. Okay.

I put my face under the kitchen sink faucet and turned it on. Water ran into my mouth, my shirt wet. Maybe you should go sit down. Alright.

The whiskey barely covered the bottle bottom. I went to take off the cap but it was gone. Fuck it. I killed the bottle and dropped it to the floor. Watch it man. Fuck off dude.

I wandered out the front door. My buddy came up. You gonna puke man? Nah. I do this all the time. He went back inside and I puked all over her porch.

Staggering against the side wall I pulled myself towards her small backyard. I lay down, the tinny blue light illuminating the patch of ill-kempt lawn around me. Fumbling with the microscopic buttons I typed out I’m sorry. I puked three more times before I sent it to her.

Eventually my buddy collected me. You need to go to the hospital dude? Yeah. Well I’m just gonna take you home OK? Alright.
He handed me a bag for the cab. No puking in the cab. I pressed my face against the cool glass

When we arrived at his place I couldn’t climb the stairs. He lifted and pushed me most of the way. We got inside and I went to the washroom and I puked on the floor.

He went to his room; I could hear him talking on the phone. Couldn’t hear what it was but it was about me. I lay on the cool floor

There was a smiley face.

It was the dead of winter on the hollowed grounds of the Turner family’s vacation estate in northern Colorado. All was calm and quiet across the endless array of rolling hills
Mr. and Mrs. Turner were in a hurry, new to Colorado helped them out the door. 
“Alrite Maurine, no sweets for either of them, and off to bed at nine thirty, no exceptions.” “You two just have fun, we’ll be fine here.” Mrs. Turner chimed in; honestly Roger, trust the girl”, she said with a chuckle. “Maurine dear, it’s year after year with these people.”  “Oh come on you old grouch. Bye kids!”
 The Turners dashed out the door. The skies opened up as heavy rain began to plummet down. Maurine shut the door as she heard the revving of an engine. The lights flashed on as the car zipped down the driveway. 
	A few hours passed as Cindy and John played board game after board game with their baby sitter who forced a smile and pictured money. The clock struck nine thirty as Maurine lit up with anticipation. “Okay kids. Time for bed.” “Ten more minutes?” “John your father said no exceptions.” The children ran upstairs and hurried off to bed. 
	Maurine dropped to the couch as if she had been shot. She rolled over
	Maurine walked over to pick it up. “Hello?” She could hear nothing more than a slight crinkling sound. “Hello?” After hanging up the phone she fell fast asleep. A few minutes later Cindy came downstairs. 
	“What are you doing up?” asked Maurine playfully with a yawn. “I can’t sleep.” “Why
	Maurine paced the vast room. She saw three statues. There was a knight, said Maurine with a warm smile. Cindy smiled back and hopped into bed. “Good night.”
	Maurine went back downstairs and the phone rang as soon as she hit the couch. She rushed to the phone this time. “Hello?” “Maurine dear
“Darling
“Get the children out of the house! I’ll phone the police!” Mrs. Turner hung up. 
	Maurine was confused. She walked up the stairs and slowly began to realize the horrific reality of her situation. At the same time, saw two of three statues, and the kids were gone. “Shit!” 
There was an open window
 	She sprinted to the opening and gazed out into the endless flash of white that appeared to be the beginnings of a blizzard. Maurine hopped out the window onto the massive ledge, and nowhere they could have gone.
 As she gazed into the far distance
Maurine’s eyes entranced, but from the nightmare that was her reality. 
She rushed across the glowing white desert and bombarded the monstrous wooden door to find both Cindy and John asleep on the ground. Maurine rushed over and picked them up. She cried at the thought of her certainty that there was a clown lurking somewhere in the barn.
 She realized her intuition to be fact when the door slammed shut before she could set foot to freedom. 
The clown “statue” glared at her and slowly paced her way
She could feel herself stepping backward. “Who are you? Why are you doing this?” The clown
 “Why don’t you know my name?” “Oh my God
Out of nowhere
Maurine ran back to see who had saved her. “Oh thank . . . you.” Maurine stood there disappointed, daddy!” yelled the children as they leapt into their parent’s arms. Mrs. Turner was in tears; “I’m just glad you’re all unharmed.” Mr. Turner walked up to a detective. “Who was this man and what did he want with my children?”
 The detective looked around and pulled Mr. Turner aside. He slowly leaned in and whispered; “He wasn’t after you or you’re kids. He knew Maurine would be here tonight. His name’s Douglas Daniels
“Who killed him?” “We aren’t sure.” Maurine was grateful to be alive. A detective came downstairs. “Ms. Daniels, and a . . . there was a knight.” 
Another detective came down; “we found a sword with blood on the ridge.” Maurine felt that same chill she had when the window lit up

""Mornin, all full-flavored reds and bubble gum. ""Lookin' nice today. As usual."" He shrugged off the last bit, sinking into his chair. It was a single booth in the center of the diner. The walls were covered in pictures of regular customers, all the booths and bar stools were chrome and baby blue, and the fans turned in slow creaks. It was an old place where you could feel grease in the air as soon as you walked in. 


The waitress looked over and smiled. In her 2 years working at Mel's


""Steel, patting him on the shoulder. 


""Well ain't that somethin', Charlie."" She scurried off behind the bar still smiling. Charlie grinned too, taking off his sunglasses. He popped open his newspaper and dove in. 


The bell above the door rang out twice as another black-suited man walked in, looking at the Sports section and walked over, his shoes sticking to the ground as he did so.


""Hiya, gnawing on a toothpick.  


""Hiya


""You know


""I bet you'll tell me even if I shoot my damn ears off."" He didn't yet take his eyes from his paper. The jukebox played Pinball Wizard faintly. 


""You're god damn right, bout 5 am. Pulled over, side of the road, I'm cleaning my gun. Yeah, I'm cleaning my gun on the side of the road, 'cause when I do it home the broad starts going off in fits, real woman shit, this


At this
	

""You're a god damn criminal


Cheeks rolled his eyes and reared his head while continuing: ""Yeah, I care. I walk up to this kid and I'm like 'Hey!' you know, like 'Hey! What the fuck do you think you're doing, huh?' And this kid, he drops his can of paint and he's just looking at me and I see it, you know, I see he's afraid of me. I mean, not moving or nothin'. He's shitting his pants, but I was waving it around in his face like we're at work or some shit. Ain't got no clip in it or nothing
	

Charlie had been looking over his shoulders, Charlie asked, ""I don't suppose there's a point here, now is there Cheeks?""
	

Cheeks lightly smacked his chair in annoyance. ""Of course there's a point!"" He said, of course he turns around and starts booking it. So I pop in the clip, square up and shoot him twice in the back. Didn't even deserve it, didn't even do a fucking thing. But it got me thinking.""
	

""Jesus Christ
	

""Yeah well it did. I'm gonna blow my fucking brains out.""	
	

""What in the hell are you talking about?""	
	

""Yeah, I know you never liked me. That's alright, and don't pretend to care and give me some bullshit about not doing it. I got my reasons, alright? And it's gonna happen. I just wanted to fucking tell somebody so that one of you could fill in for me on the bank job.""
	

""Are you fucking kidding me?"" laughed Charlie
	

""Yeah, I'll buy your fucking breakfast."" The waitress came back with Charlie's eggs. She set the plate down in front of him, with two sausages in a little saucer on the side that she snuck to him. 
	

""You're too kind
	

""Oh, ya'll enjoy, okay?""
	

""Will do, sticking his napkin down the front of his collar. He picked up fork and took a big bite.
	

""The fuck did you just call her?"" Cheeks sat up, and finished chewing.
	

""Bev.""
	

""That's Donna.""  
	

""No
	

""I know what Bev is short for, okay? It's Donna.""
	

""The hell's it matter what her name is?
	

""Because it fucking matters, you know, you gotta call somebody by their own name. None of this nickname bullshit.""
	

""Well, on account of that's her name.""
	
""I'm fucking TELLING you, and don't you call her Bev not one more god damn time, you hear me? I swear to God, Charlie, don't call her Bev again, or I'll put a fucking bullet in you. Alright?""
	

""You won't put shit in shit."" Charlie looked Cheeks dead in the eye
	

""Oh yeah?"" replied Cheeks. There were a few moments where both sat in silence at the table. Eggs mostly untouched, both had their handguns drawn from their belts, pointing them at each other under the table. The both sat stiffly upright, eyes fully open, yet somehow appeared calm, experienced. 


""You want to make a bet?"" asked Cheeks, you put one in mine. How's that sound?"" 


Charlie continued to stare him down. It had been a relaxing morning
	

""What?""
	

""A pussy. Do I. Look like a pussy. To you?"" Cheeks looked confused. They both began to perspire. ""Only a pussy would take that bet, and you can put a bullet in my belly, then one in my throat. Right here. And if I'm right, I'll do the same."" Cheeks licked his lips and looked around. No one had any idea what was going down. ""Well, what's it gonna be?""
	

""Fuck yeah
	

They flagged down another waitress passing by and asked her to bring over theirs. They requested that she take off her name tag. They were having a little bet
	

""Don't cry when she gets here
	

""Her name is Donna
	

""I'm sorry
	

""Oh yeah
	

""A man is sure
	

""Fuck you. Fuck you and your bullshit
	

""Now listen here, Bev has been my waitress. She's five-four, lives over in The Gallery on Gilbeaux, has a kid named Danny and a dog named Pepper. She sneaks me sausages and refills my coffee when it's empty. Bev does all this, all the while me addressing her by her name, to her face. Now just how in the hell do you think I've gotten by all this time if her name was Donna?""
	

Cheeks' face dropped. He seemed uncertain, this was Donna. Her name was Donna. He was certain. 
	

The waitress got to the table still smiling. ""What can I do you for
	

He took a sip of his coffee, then looked away. ""I'm sorry 'bout this, I really am, but my acquaintance and I are having a little bet.""
	

Cheeks interrupted, Wednesdays at The Dog. And I says your name is Donna.""


The three of them looked back and forth at one another. A two legged Mexican standoff. The waitress didn't know what to say
	

""Now, so just tell us one time, in all honest, what your first name is.""
	

She wasn't sure if it was a joke or not
	

""It's Donna.""
	

Charlie looked a little surprised as the bullet tore through his stomach, and the cooks out the back. Within minutes, the only sounds were Donna's screaming and Charlie's slow groans. 

	
""I fucking TOLD you, suited body of his coworker. ""Hey, shut the fuck up!"" He pointed his gun at Donna, who held her hands over her mouth immediately and got down on the floor. He pointed it back at Charlie, whose breath was quick and light. They locked eyes. ""Well?""
	

""Well..."" choked Charlie, at nothing at all, lost in the shock. 
	

""Well?""
	

""Well then... who the fuck is Bev?"" Charlie managed a small laugh. Cheeks was taken back


""Sorry, now cold. ""but I got no clue."" He shot Charlie in the throat. The old man's body jerked and fell completely flat as Donna began to scream again. Cheeks stood her up with force, still staring at Charlie's mostly dead body.
	

""Sorry about that
	

Cheeks turned away from her and laughed. The last thing he tasted was the barrel of his gun, out the top of his skull and got stuck in a ceiling tile. 
	

Donna screamed louder and ran out of the diner. Sirens wouldn't sound for minutes. While Charlie's life approached its final seconds

My name is Ian Ruhte. I don't know why I am thinking that. Of course I know my name. I know who I am. I became who I am by choice. Not my choice

My head hurts. I need something to drink. I'd drink a barrel of salt water right now to get this sweater off my tongue. I know who put me here. It was Shiloh Conners. He has to die.

Shiloh Conners beat me bad. I was just looking for a book. Yes

Shiloh Conners didn't want anyone to read that book

I need a drink.

**Chapter One**  

Ian Ruhte slept peacefully on a straw mat, exhausted and tense.

""Doesn't make sense to kill yourself so slowly

""Don't tell me not to worry. One of these days you're not going to come back. It's a dangerous job.""

""Dangerous

""Is a guaranteed living better than a probable death?""

""Red don't do this to me. You knew I was in training to be a field rigger. We met at a bar full of them!""

""I just don't think it's worth it when there are so many safer jobs in town.""

""Safer jobs won't make us wealthy.""

""Wealth hasn't anything to do with it when you are laid out and dead.""

""At least then you could collect some good insurance. You'd be set for quite a few years.""

Red glared at him. That was an enraging statement and always cut deep when Ian said things like that.

""That's cruel Ian. You're a cruel man.""

""No crueler than I need to be. Honesty may be cruel but it has come to me quite nicely."" He stepped closer and kissed his wife. Every kiss they shared was electric. That was what brought them together in the first place- that electricity. Ian washed his face and dressed. ""I'll send word if I'm going to be gone for more than a few days

""I pray you won't be. I need you here more often."" Red sighed and wiped the weariness from her face. 

""I love you Red. Please take care."" Ian kissed her again, and fell asleep.

**Chapter Two**  

I remember the bar where I first met Red. It was called the Backwoods Game Lounge, but it made me strong. Not strong enough to kill that bastard, but strong enough to break into the Central House and find the book.

I didn't only meet Red at the bar. I met the man who changed my life. Who opened my eyes to the truth. He called himself.. what did he call himself? The Wizard. Yes, and he knew who that bastard really was and what he'd done. He probably knew what he'd do too. I think the Wizard should have died too. I don't know. Once I find and kill Shiloh, I'll find the Wizard and find out what he really knew. Then I'll kill him. 

That book was no history. I read the chapter that I felt drawn to. It was clear that it may have been historical like a myth or something

I wonder if the Wizard wrote this. He seemed like a smart man. Round face. Round glasses. Hair that curled out under his cap. He wasn't round

He had to have written it. He practically told me so himself. I wonder how old he really was. He didn't look more than forty. He had to be older. He begged me

He knew what that evil man had done.

**Chapter Three**

Ian woke with a start. His parents were arguing again. Five years young

""I'm telling you Martha

""Well then maybe your dad should just take his money. It couldn't possibly be worse.""

""It is worse because he gets to dictate who trades what

""He's young. The youngest ruler in the Central House that we've ever seen. He'll change as he grows into it.""

""He lied and cheated his way in. Building his legacy on that foundation I don't think he's going to change. He's going to make the farmers his men with money or with violence. It's just wrong. My father and I are going to stand against him.""

""You'll die.""

""And I'll take out as many as I can with me.""

""How could you be so cruel! Ian is only five. How on earth could I provide for him?""

""You'll get my severance pay. You'll get income from the farm- my mother will see to that even if my father dies with me.""

Martha couldn't keep the tears from streaming down her face. Ian cried too

""Ian

""Of course mommy. I won't leave you."" A child's promise. Pure

Ian took care of his mom for two more years until she died. She cried a lot. She didn't cry when she was dead. Ian thought that was better.

**Chapter Four**

I know why my dad died. I read it in the book. They thought it was a history. ""The Real History of the Central Houses"" it was called. Houses. As in more than one. I only ever knew the one. How can you have more than one center? It was in the book. There used to be two Houses. The City House and the Country House. 

I never knew there was a Country House. When I was a little kid all the country was were farmers and hunters and riggers. I knew I wanted to be a rigger. I didn't know what I'd wind up being. I didn't know I'd have nearly killed the man who lead the city house. I never called it the City House. I just knew it as the Central House. I went there when I was twelve to apply for apprenticeship. I was denied. Even without parents I couldn't apply until I was sixteen. Two years of apprenticeship and then I would become a fellow. Fellows got the good pay. No one likes being a rigger. Most people didn't make it past apprenticeship before they left and went to drive carts or take some city job.

I was good at rigging. Taking down trees, and building. It took a lot of work, and every day I was sore. That's why I went the the Backwoods Game Lounge. It was a place to relax and drink and just far enough to walk home and sober up some. Red came in one night. She was just a country girl who wanted a taste. Her first taste. I was seventeen. She was seventeen. I sat next to her and we hit it off. We were just sober enough to feel the electricity when we walked home.

I grabbed a drink from a water barrel just a minute ago. Terrible water. City people get the worst of it. No water here. Used to be very little food. That's what the real history told me. The real history told me about how the Houses were united. I'm not sure if United is the right word

The Wizard knew what I'd read

No more would he have to apply the stinking insect  repellent that had put a real hole in his wallet. He stood up out of his steel chair and into the warmth of the setting sun, as per usual. Jonas was lucky to see 30 cars a day, and only around 10 of those would stop for gas. He spat on the ground indignantly and turned back to his seat, waiting for the darkness to roll in.

Roger tripped and fell into the dust. He grumbled and coughed up blood. He watched silently as it dripped from his lips and stained the earth an ugly crimson. He stretched his neck to look behind him. The searchlight was reversing direction away from him, the Arizona desert did not retain any of the harsh midday heat. He lifted his head towards the small town and pulled himself to his feet. He staggered towards the town until he entered a small dusty parking lot. His feet had began to ache in his moccassins. There was but one car, an old looking Nissan. He brought himself the the passenger's side door and pulled a bobby pin from his leather jacket pocket. He'd stolen enough vehicles to know how to break into this old model.

Jonas screwed up his nose in disgust, Roderick, stepped outside and looked at the bug-zapper.
'New toy Jonas?'
'Eeyup' Jonas replied 'Got it delivered today after 2 weeks of waitin
'Well shoot Jonas' Roderick laughed and smacked Jonas on the shoulder 'You've gone outdid yerself this time boy'
'Thankin you kindly' Jonas said, dust was being kicked up. 'Incoming customer Rod' he said flatly. Roderick walked back into the store and stood behind the register.

Kate sped along the long empty stretch of highway. She glanced at her gas meter
'How much
'Just a refill to the top' she said quickly. Wanting him to hurry up and get to it so she could leave this creepy place. But he didn't. He stayed at the window. She was about to tell him to leave when he moved to the back of her car, realising she had been tensed up. Her relief didn't last for long as he popped back into view. 
'Ma'am?'
'What! What is it!' she shouted. 
'Uhh
'Oh
'Is that okay?' she asked impatiently. His eyes didn't leave hers
'Yes, she didn't like this strange man who wouldn't stop staring. She thought of her boyfriend and how nice it would be to just get back to him, back to safety.
'Ma'am? It's done
'Card' she said curtly, it seemed like he was looking right through her. Suddenly, he turned on his heel and walked back towards the station. She sighed and felt her chest, her heart was hammering. She wished for him to just hurry up so she could leave this horrible station with it's creepy attendant in the middle of some god-forsaken desert. Then, like her wish had been granted, he was back at her window. 
'Ma'am
He had come back too soon
'Ma'am, his voice weird and shaky. Kate couldn't take much more.
'Cash then!' she shrieked
'Ma'am' he warbled

****
Jonas stood in disbelief. He watched as the car sped away from him until it was out of sight entirely. He collapsed to the floor and sobbed violently. Roderick heard him and rushed outside to his broken partner. 
'Jonas!' he shouted as he reached him. He place his big hands on to Jonas' shoulders and looked down at the smaller man. 'What's wrong lad?' 
Jonas raised his head and looked Roderick in the eyes. 'I couldn't save her man
'Who? Who couldn't you save? The customer?' Roderick said
'The girl' Jonas said after a few minutes stony silence, but I couldn't tell her.'
'Tell her what?' Rod said softly
'About him' Jonas said flatly
'Who? About who?'
'He was in the leg room of the passenger seat
'Who Jonas? Who was it?' Roderick shouted
'The man in the leather jacket and dusty moccassins. He had a knife in his hand and a finger to his lips.'

The young man handed a ten dollar bill across the counter
A lovely bouquet, and walked out of the market pavilion, exiting onto the downtown side street. 

The late afternoon was bright and hot and the dewy flowers glistened optimistically. He headed down the street clutching the bouquet

He passed through a crowd gathered at a bus stop

Faggot, hoping he was not overheard. 

Probably.

The young man proceeded down the busy city thoroughfare

He paused at a corner

Yo man

Sure.

Thanks bro. Cool flowers dude.

Thanks.

Take ‘er easy man

He took a few drags before starting down the street again. It was very warm

The alley exited onto a nearly vacant parking lot

The street was less busy than the one he had just left and he was thankful. The only person visible was a homeless man sitting on a spread of cardboard sipping from a worn paper cup. The young man considered crossing the street to avoid contact but decided it would be too obvious.

Spare some change? 

Sorry
I’ll take those flowers instead.

Ha

The street exited onto another main road and he took a right onto it, acoustic music was audible there, percussion there, and a wailing street person there. 

His mouth was dry and his feet swam in his shoes. There was a Starbucks just ahead and he decided to stop for an ice water.
The line was long, the haggard baristas pouring ices and syrups into taxed blenders. He got to the front of the line and ordered his water. The cashier smiled with relief for the brief respite.

Those are beautiful flowers

He grabbed his water and moved through the crowded café towards the exit. A girl in a short sundress was coming through and he held the door for her with his elbow

Thanks

You’re welcome

They paused for a moment
The sidewalks were filling with nine to fivers finished the grind

Despite his best efforts the flowers were getting jostled. A small yellow carnation was crushed down and in, unfolding the plastic from over it. 

He crossed the street to cut across the park. Large trees shaded couples sprawled on benches, kissing too hard, listening to music too loud. They watched videos on their phones and they sat in each other’s laps. He walked across the grass watching them frankly. No one watched him. 

The grass ended and concrete began. His destination was just up the street and he could see the squat grey building sprawled before him. He was a bit later than intended. He wanted another cigarette but didn’t want to smell like smoke. 

He got to the parking lot and stopped. Cars were pulling out and he stopped to let them pass. The drivers looked at him. He climbed the steps to the front of the building and stopped. The large doors and a small garbage can with cigarette butts littered around it stood before him. He stood.

Fuck.

He took the decaying bouquet and shoved it into the ashy garbage. 

Fuck.

Gripping the door handle he pulled hard and entered the building.

Picture two houses across the street from one another. They looked perfectly normal and sturdy on the outside, however, liked being outside the confines of their own house.

One day, told stories, and enjoyed the others company. At the end of the day, the man returned to his house.

The next day he visited again, he would immediately come over to fix the damage with a smile on his face. The two housekeepers became used to seeing one another each day, and eventually, the woman would come over to the man's house to visit. The woman noticed that his house looked much worse on the inside than hers, and started to sneak inside at night while he was asleep to make repairs. When the man would try to fix something himself, or repair damages to his own house, he would fail,  he would notice that things would be fixed. This puzzled the man and he decided to ask the woman about it the next time she came over.

The next evening they spent together,
""Because people who show a caring and wholesome heart deserve to receive the same treatment they give to others."" The man became confused.
          ""But I am a shut in. Nobody gives to me

The woman put her hand on the man's shoulder and looked into his dark brown eyes. She noticed a hurt that had always seemed to hide beneath his smile

The two embraced

The following morning, and cleaning her patio. Each day the house would look more and more beautiful. He became sad that the woman had found somebody else to do her work, and started to loathe the landscaper that would beautify her house all the time.

The woman remained indoors all day, and was only after her money. She began to miss her neighbors company, along with his sturdy repairs and his gentle smile. As days went by, the man and woman thought about each other more and more, but never saw each other.

One afternoon, she opened the door and looked for pranksters. Looking down, she saw a small, dirty looking tin with a bow neatly placed on top of it.

The interior of the unkempt tin was extravagantly decorated with soft velvet from top to bottom, she unfolded the small note and noticed little droplets of water on the page.

""You are the only one that can make it feel less empty. Please take care of it for me while I'm gone. I must go

After reading it the woman dropped to her knees, as if he never tried to correct the small mistakes she had made.

Eventually, she noticed he was packing his belongings into boxes. Fearing that he might move away, the woman mustered up the courage to go talk to the man.

""Why are you putting everything into boxes?"" The woman asked.
    ""Because, slamming the door and fighting back tears.

The next morning

""I will always love you

The man's face turned into a broad smile, the necklace glistening in the sunlight. She ran into his arms and they kissed for what felt like an eternity. The pair continued to load all of their belongings into the one moving truck, and left that very evening. Holding hands with his true love, the man looked into the rear view mirror to see the sun setting on the old, abandoned houses for the last time, and felt what was truly a pure happiness. An odd and relieving sensation washed over him like a tide, as he realized that he would never have to search for anything in his life

The Cycle 
- By Blacktyde 


                                               

- Four hundred....fifty..hmm..everyone remain still! 
- What are you counting?
- ..seven
- Well! About one billion six hundred and fifty give or take a few. 
Not a bad turn out this time around. 
- This time..?
- Alright! Total restart! Time to bring em around again. 
- Restart!? hey!
- Oh quiet.I’ll see you again in a moment or two.
- Relax for what? what’s being restarted? where am I?
- So many questions!
- There would be less if you’d answer them!
- Oh and some attitude too! 
- You have to understand my frustration! 
- I don't have to do anything 
- I'm sorry if I'm being demanding
- Thats quite alright
- right! and answers would be a wonderful addition to them.
- Well ok then
-Alright
- HAH thats your first question? who else could I be? 
- I guess I should’ve known
- Yes
- I suppose
- Ask away! 
- what’s being restarted? 
- Humanity of course!.
- Humanity!? how would you restart all of humanity? 
- Its simple really
- But it just ended! right?

- Yes it did! And now its going to start! again!
- What? Why restart it? 
- Because you’re not all here.
- Whos not all here?
- Humans
- Yeah...the ones that don’t deserve to be here are left behind. Thats the point. 
- Who exactly are the ones that don’t deserve to be here?
- the others! The non believers of course! 
- Believe it or not
- But we are not now!
- True. You all have found your way. Thats all it is. The others are just lost. Thats why you need another restart. Do it all over again. Until they find their way.
- But they won’t! They rejected you!
- But you didn't! You all did not!
- Well obviously...I de-...we dedicated our lives to you! 
- Yes I know, we're not here the previous times. And yes you did finally dedicate your life to me, and you’ll dedicate many, many more. 
- What do you mean many more? Reincarnation? 
- Hmm I suppose
- But you promised us an eternity with you. Here
 - Oh no
- What do you mean? The world ended! All the signs were there. And we all got pulled at once. To..here. Wherever here is. 
- I know
- You’ve lost me. 
- Humanity is just, and you believers and nonbelievers are sent back through. Its only a few moments to me but...a lifetime to you.
- Sent back through? Why on earth would you do that?
- As I said before. You’re not all here. This cycle will continue to happen until you’re all here. 
- Well how does that work exactly? 
- Well, before they even exist?
- Yes
- Precisely! You
- Earned it? I always thought of it more as a curse than a reward. you pre setting our choices before we even make them
- Not your choices all together
- I still don't see how thats a reward. 
- Before you earn this reward
- But don't you, choose who will be predestined before the beginning of time? 
- Yes
- You’re confusing but I'm trying. 
- Every time I end the cycle. The people who believed and worshiped and glorified me will, however many more times it takes, you will always end up back here.
- And the people who don’t believe? They always...wont end up back here?
- No! Of course not! They have the freewill to choose or not to choose to follow me. I decide not to know, THEIR choices. 
- And more believers come back each time?
- Thats the idea. 
- I'm beginning to understand the point of this cycle. you let them choose you, to avoid hell and what not. 
- More on the “what not” side
-  But why not predestin all the people to believe? - Why keep this cycle going?
- Why? Thats how it must be! Restarting life until they do it correctly. Until they deserve to move on! To fulfill the purpose of life. 
- Which is?
- More questions hm? Well... you tell me. What do you
- Well..worship
- But why do that stuff? Why live like that?
- To be a good person I suppose..you want your followers to be good people? To stand out?
- Partially... Well how about this, or candy he really wants. And he doesn't. what does that do for you, the parent?
 - It makes me proud of my child of course 
 - And how does your child’s choices reflect on you
- It makes me look like a great parent.
- Yes! One could say
- So you’re saying its all for creating an image for yourself?
- Right. Creations glorifying their creator. 
- Seems a bit self centered!
- I made you
- I suppose not, is to bring you glory? 
- Yes thats the purpose of humanity! To bring glory to your creator. Through your actions and choices. And show the others his greatness. 
- Thats a lot of work just for glory.
-  I created you
- Yes but I still don’t see why everyone can’t be predestined....the act does not become less good if everyone’s doing it.
- You’re right. But if I am standing next to my child and I make him not steal the toy
- Ah I see. the choice must be made by their own free will first. Before they are saved. 
- Exactly! And once they’ve freely made that choice
- So we just redo the same earth over and over again?
- Ehhh..not exactly, wherever your soul ends up. Its a gamble really. 
- Well...who does that leave us as? When we finally return? Do we keep the soul of who we were last?
-  Yes! Along with all the others!
- Others? Our past souls join us also? How would that work?
- Ah always a question. You know you won’t remember any of this in a moment right?
 - I don’t care.
- Well you see. Your all one soul. Split into many.
 -I don’t understand
- When you’re all here. You all have the same soul. You will be in a different body. A body that has nothing to do with human definition. 
- So we are all one person?
- In a way
- You’re not making sense again. I need more of an explanation! 
- You’re getting there! Your mind still can't wrap itself around this yet. 
- Well help me wrap it around! Help me understand.
- Come now. Lets leave something to talk about next time hm?
- I hate the idea of waiting that long...even if I don't know it 
- Oh you'll be back here in no time at all. 
- Yes but I won't remember this conversation
- Its alright. I have the time to explain again. Maybe even further next time. if you’re up to it! 
- How does this restart happen anyway?
- A split second here. And eternity for you between each cycle. It really blows even my mind. You all become smarter and smarter each time around, lets see now. How many this time?",,False,,t5_2qhmi,1373412799.0,,

“The “you” that I believe is you, but something entirely unknowable to me. If there is a “you”, you exist at a point in time and space that I will never reach; nor will I ever be able to objectively observe what exists there. It is impossible for me to prove your existence beyond the framework of my own mind. Therefore it is irrational for me to believe in you” He said, his voice rising. “ I cannot believe in you! I do not believe in you!” 

With that, so you were an illusion all along! Logic and reason have triumphed over the untrustworthy human senses!” The philosopher turned on his side, and slept comfortably.

1372992738.0,1ho53k,Untitled,SethIsInSchool,3,2,0,"My father (Walter) married Darcy in 1992 after six months of acquaintance
	
Walter was 61 years old come September. He worked at a company that sold cleaning products which, a belief he’d held onto since he was a teen was that doing boring things is like meditating. And so he did so for nine hours a day. And then he would continue being bored well after he got home until he went to bed (in a separate room from his wife’s), and he would read a boring book, and then dream boring dreams (sometimes of reading boring books), and then wake up and eat (boring) breakfast.
	
Life was predictable for Walter. One day while reading the paper, packaging cleaning product, and when he got to work it was exactly what he expected. While he was packaging cleaning product, he was thinking about watching television with his dog. In fact, for an old man with so little future ahead of him, he spent an unusually large amount of time thinking about it.
	
The only time that Walter wasn’t hyper-aware of his boredom and thinking about the future was when he was sitting in his chair watching TV, French voice preceded her entry into the living room.

“That damn dog puked on the cahpet!” she said
	
A week later he arrived home from work to Darcy walking briskly out of the house yelling. Her attempts to make herself heard were futile as Walter had the windows up so that all that penetrated the glass were muffled bass notes. He stepped out of the car.
	
“- Rug again. Get rid of that dog! Get rid of it-” he tuned her out again.
	
That night he sat in his chair with his dog in his lap, he dreamed of working in the factory.
	
The next day, and worked all day, just as he’d imagined the night before. When he got home, things began to veer off from their normal path. Darcy didn’t come out to meet him in the driveway to complain today. In fact, the house was eerily quiet, although he couldn’t quite place what it was that was so different. When he got to the door, he realized what it was- the dog wasn’t barking. He stepped inside. Darcy was standing in the kitchen with her hands on her hips.
	
“You were taking too long to get rid of the dog so I did.”
	
He didn’t listen anymore
	
She complained about other things
	
That night, he made his way downstairs and dug through little odds and ends until he found a can of mogas. He took it upstairs with him and poured it all through the house, making extra sure to douse the entryway rug, and the area outside her Darcy’s bedroom door, then lit a match and dropped it on the trail. 
	
As he made his way back to his room he reflected on all of his life spent in boredom. He did not regret it, the shrill calls of the woman to whom he was married. He entered his bedroom, which was, again, not shared with his wife. Walter pulled his slippers off his feet and lay down in his small bed. The house was getting hotter, and with every second he lay there he became more tired, then he fell asleep.

Becc ran to catch up with his father, bestowed unto those whose deeds of valor in battle were legendary. Becc was the exact opposite of his father. He was small and timid and had never even swung a sword in his life. In fact, Becc had never done much to contribute to village life, always being side lined by his father on the simplest of tasks. Once, His father had refused to let him spear fish on the River Fial with the other boys. More water had flown from Becc’s eyes that day than all the rivers on the continent of Dulra.

The man who had served their village as Conn was not cruel, nor would he purposely hurt his own son. Becc knew this, for his father had taught him all about their ancient continent and the dangers that lay outside the safety of their village. He confines me for my own sake; I am too weak for the outside world. What if I ran into a Druid, or even worse… A Sage. Father had always taught him that life was a precious thing and it would be careless to through it away so easily in the wastelands of Dulra. “Remember our lessons Becc, I have heard what is to hear

A mass of heads, but this isn't a little boy's birthday party. This isn't your daughter's stupid-song-of-the-day-time in kindergarten. This room is a single organism, a frenzy of limbs, an *orgy* of body parts. It's hard to distinguish an ""individual"" within the mass of flesh. Some faces stand out every now and then, only to be englobed by the collective. The hive-mind. The sheepish mass of sheep, docile and obedient sheep sheepishly following orders. Fingers wrapped around the rusty chain of command. The chain of blind obedience.

Some of them sheared their fluff, or maybe they made cozy bonfires with it, sat around it, playing an acoustic guitar while screaming beautiful songs. That made everything absolutely fine. They were against the system, they had cleansed their soul, and were ready for the prize. The final big prize sitting somewhere above this waiting room, on the higher floors, blinding pillars descending from the heavens
The walls breathe. 
The *rooms* breathe.
They inhale fresh clean air which only gold can buy, like a sacred elixir that grants eternal life.
Then... they calmly exhale.
Breathing radioactive clouds into the scraper's skeleton

Stratospheres below, the mass of flesh keeps on moving and morphing. The faces that stood out, they popped out like mushrooms in autumn, devouring the stagnant air, stealing it from other starving mouths. All of them, waiting. (Relatively) eternally waiting. Waiting for what? Waiting for something magical to happen. Waiting for Nora Helmer's ""miracle"" to happen. Waiting for a great plateau. The peak of their meagre existence. Once they reached the summit, their personal Mount Everest, then they plummeted down the other side. With the blink of an eye, we all turn grey

They're here to stay. They're so far away
They don't occupy the rooms
They're omniscient beings
If you listen
Many whispers.
Coming from every side.
Every corner.
Gentle murmurs fill up the room like little bugs
If you close your eyes
If you're lucky
Little bumps filled with unutterable secrets appear and disappear on your body.
The bugs cannot be deciphered, the cracks in the wall seem to charge with energy. With every pulse, low tones make the walls vibrate. Dust particles are shaken off. A thick bass lets blood seep through the cracks in the wall, through the all-seeing eyes of this room. This *entity*. 

The Big Big Brothers and Big Sisters of the monolithic structure. They're always watching. Through kilometers and kilometers of invisible cobwebs
They crawl around like sneaky tarantulas or mighty goliath bird-eaters. They find a nice spot
And wait.
Waiting for the best moment to strike. To sink their poison-filled fangs into their prey. To devour. To consume. To feed on the sorrow of the weak

“Wow. You guys always have the best equipment. Didn’t I see you at the… Dogwood Fire

“Thanks. Always good to hear that. Yeah. Weren’t you at the Calaveras Complex Fire, with Smokejumpers and Hotshots.  The data took only a few seconds to download.

“Yeah, there? You look a little young. No offense.”

“None taken. No. I was running the fuel trucks, before answering.

“05:12 to 20:06. Fuel trucks

“Sideways. I always seem to move sideways. This look like your line?” He studied the screen.

“That was fast. Yeah. That’s it.” I handed back his Garmin.

“How much does this thing cost

“Depends on a number of things. For this fire, here.” I always avoided detailing specifics in price. No one ever instructed me to, but it seemed like a good policy.

“Ah, you have set up the whole base camp.”

“Exactly. Everything but the kitchens

“So

“Ha. Maybe so. I’d have to sit down with a calculator to figure, roughly, once camp was setup. Tents, generators, light towers, portable toilets, water tenders, shower unit

“Then you should buy my crew a drink

“Deal. I can throw it on the company card. Maybe I’ll finally convince that bartender to finally sell me some of that mammoth ivory.”

And that was the first charge on the company card I got yelled at for. 21 beers… per round. The Salmon River Brewery was a good time. I never did get any of that mammoth ivory, both figurative and literal. I wouldn’t see Jesse again, but I would never forget the imposing, frowning figure he made, with his arms folded in the command tent, tattoo exposed of a mattock crossed with a shovel, surrounded by flames. I never would have guessed they would have died together

Mistakes were made. If you are always aware of the “watch out” situations, 5, 6, 7 and 12 are the ones that always make your skin crawl during initial attack.

4. Unfamiliar with weather and local factors influencing fire behavior 
8. Constructing line without safe anchor point. 
15. Wind increases and/or changes direction.
17. Terrain or fuels make escape to safety zones difficult.  

They let four go, thinking in his mind, saying on the radio. He was the only one in the Granite Mountain Interagency Hotshot Crew to survive. I remember the first firefighter death that happened while I was on an incident. He climbed under a brush truck, deployed his shelter, and laid on his radio button. It took over the channel. We listened to the whole thing in the communications trailer that had just suffered a power loss from one of the generators failing. It would have been better if we had waited to fix it.

The shelters are mylar-like, though they may save your life, if you have to deploy, you are still going to get burned really, really bad. Many report considering suicide by smoke inhalation to make the burning stop. The water in your canteen boils out and becomes steam, adding another kind of burn. You are supposed to drink the water from your canteen, but

And that is the thought I have of my friend and the crew he commanded; huddled together in the largest group of shelters ever deployed by a hotshot crew, screaming, praying. Burning. Wishing they had set up an anchor point.

That is exactly why I stopped doing it. Those are exactly the thoughts I never want to have about people I know and care about.

For several minutes Ryan pondered his situation. Could he still be dreaming? He didn’t feel as if he was in a dream
	
After what felt like hours
	
“FUCK!” Ryan cried. All of the sudden he could feel intense pain coursing throughout his entire body. It felt as if all of his muscles had just been pounded by a meat tenderizer. His feeling had certainly returned

Ryan could sense a fine mist spraying his body. This is when he realized he was naked. His sense of sight and hearing were returning. He could hear a faint hum, lying in his own bed had sunk in.

The pain began to subside
As he walked out into the large circular chamber he could see fifty or sixty men and women, shouting and crying; 

“Help!”


“Where the hell am I?”

“What is this?”

“Let me out of here!”

Ryan tried to form the words “I’m cold” but was unable to get enough breath behind his speech. He saw hundreds of capsules surrounding him. The chamber was lined with them
On the other side of the chamber was a large arched opening. Ryan could see groups of people heading in that direction

“Girls head up the left ramp

Ryan headed towards the man. Now able to speak he asked him.  

“Who are you? Where am I?” 

“I know less than you do

Hearing him speak

“Professor Harper?” 

“Hello Mr. Stein. Please go up the ramp”.

“Well, “nobody much likes the action.”
“Bunch’a yokels
Boo made a forced laugh. “It’s good to see a man who can take the torque of a roller-coaster ride on the market.”
“No guts

The Yankees got drawn south by the low taxes. They all said it was the weather, New Jersey. You hang on there, you’re just paying lavish retirements for a pack of parasite unionized civil servants.
So they flock south to a university town with “culture” not that you noticed it much. A teaching hospital to keep your sorry carcass upright. Buy up all the nice real estate and drive the penurious faculty out of the town.  Retired
Boo didn’t feel bad about what he was doing. He was young and needed to make his way in the world. Marvin had no use for the money. Just leave it to adult children that he constantly bitched about. Ingrates. Free-loaders. Moochers.
Marvin struggled to his feet
Boo had been the bottom of his prep school class and couldn’t get into the Ivies. One admissions director had actually laughed at him. Asked what “diversity” he would bring to the student body. “Old money wastrel? The vanishing New England WASP?” What a shit-head.
So he had come to the university along with the rest of the bottom of his class. Administrative fools actually fawned on them
Boo had been a lacrosse star. Had a mop of blond hair he could flip out of his eyes
Problem was, there were no Wall Street connections either.
So Boo got his broker’s license and stayed on in town. His high-performing pals from his prep school class had all been Dartmouth and Yale; now they were at Goldman Sachs. Always talking big deals. Who the heavy hitters were.  The big swinging dicks.
He’d tell them he liked the low-key atmosphere of the South. Honey-voiced belles. Mint juleps. Said he was thinking of buying a race horse stud. They were working eighty-hour weeks and sounded envious. They had no idea what a ratty state it was. Dead textile mills. Feed-lot hog farms. Hillbillies in the mountains.
Boo played racquetball and squash now
He could picture himself married to one of them. Scale back his business and just manage her personal fortune. Take up fly fishing. They’d travel to New Zealand
A row of three dollar signs began blinking in the upper right of his computer screen.  Got him out of his reverie.
Good Christ, never withdrew any. They never fucking touched it. 
And it just sat there in an account that paid maybe two-percent. He always got a home office congratulations letter on his mismanagement of that one. The New York office got to play with the money and pay the Fitzhughs peanuts for the use of it.
He had only met them one time when the total was six million. Maeve Fitzhugh had seemed bored by the whole thing. Totally disinterested. Kept checking phone messages.
He pulled up the photos of mother and daughter. The firm always kept pictures in case of identify issues. The mother was what his mother in Greenwich would call a “handsome woman.” Mid-forties. Clean face lines. Hair pulled back. Very outdoorsy. Wind-burned complexion. Did some kind of exploration thing.
The girl was just a junior in high school. But there was something compelling about her. Her eyes just pulled you in.
He’d sit and stare at her for long periods of time.

We headed down through a yellow field of tall grasses.  Its slope converged at the center like a valley, a mystical bastion of all freedoms.

The field's ending was demarcated by a sort of incomplete fence, well acquainted with the ways of the city's center.  He'd told us stories about all of the nooks and strange neighborhoods, the nudists and the secret passageways and the unique chill you could feel when you ate ice cream on the beach near the Golden Gate Bridge.

Matt was just the person I wanted to see.  Though I knew it would disappoint my brother, mosses, and bird droppings.

We overcame the precipice

“I have to get home for dinner

*Damn*, alone with my similarly-minded brother.  We stepped up, upon the artificially elevated ground of the yard, and looked around.  The rows went on for what seemed like forever.  I noticed a huge chamber near the center, which had to be a tomb for someone important.  As I went along, I observed the dates on the graves.  I was surprised at the age: they were almost exclusively from the mid-to-late 1700s, and the few exceptions were only slightly newer.  One must have been a young boy: his date of death was just before his eighth birthday.  Some had flowery patterns carved into the sides

I reached the massive tomb.  The faded brown doors exuded an antiquated feeling, the door was missing one of its bolts.  This rendered it almost imperceptibly ajar, but the opening was there.  I cautiously took another step forward and heard a crunch under my foot.  Curious, I leaned down and picked up the note.

The handwriting was scrawled hurriedly

“NOT ME AGAIN”

I dropped it and ran blindly from the tomb.  My eyes scanned the graveyard and I realized that I didn't know where my brother was.  I tripped and fell, and rationalized it by acknowledging the likelihood of bored vandals.

1371714523.0,1gprm0,Summer,mirrormirror07,3,1,3,"*Blurb*: A girl Sandy writes a recount of one memorable summers day.



The word summer doesn't necessarily make me think of the season

The first memory that grabs me took place in primary school

I was dressed for school and left the house on my bike to stop by at my best friends house who lived around the corner from me. I remember being let in and I sat down in the kitchen

""Ready?"" I asked her when she came in.

She headed straight for the fridge. ""I haven't eaten.""

That, I started to panic because there was no way we'd make it in time and I didn't want to be told off. The details of who talked who into just skipping school altogether isn't clear in my memory. What I can tell you is we were both capable of fitting that role so what did it matter? The last thing I remember is both of us turning our bikes around on tiptoe and heading for the bike track that ran along the end of the street.

The funny thing about memories are visual details aren't always clear, vibrant yellow cotton balls on them and it gave off a smell of hay. I remember them well because the blossoms would stick to you like glue, in your hair and on your clothes. The trail we took led us to ride under a dozen of them, I even braved riding straight into some of its branches and probably came out wearing more blossoms than clothes.

There was a place we liked to go to at that age (I want to say I was twelve). The bike track is really nice, The Craft. Jasmine and I were past the idea of being witches by that stage but we continued to visit the tree for the nostalgia.

There was a branch on this tree that stood above the creek and was the perfect place to eat lunch. I carefully climbed up the trunk to the branch and began to crawl the rest of the way across like a frog; arms and legs clinging to the width of it and stopped when I was perfectly centre of the water flow below.

I really wish I could remember exactly what happened next, but when you're small it feels like the length of a ravine.

Have you ever had a dream where you're falling, but I believed I was going to die that day. I was crying out to be saved; I wish it was video taped and shown to actors/actress' of how desperation is meant to look. I would've won all the movie awards.

""Sandy, sounding firm and in control. I doubt that's actually how she felt but I don't remember any dramatic facial expressions, she just appeared collected about the situation.

I managed to grab her hand, let alone pull me up. And that's when I realised she was going to let go before she even said anything.

""I don't want to die

At this point

I was possibly about to overdose on naturally produced adrenaline and endorphins that I did not even feel the impact

I was no longer crying. I might have stopped the second my friend let go. I just sat there in the middle of the shallow creek (you heard me

Eventually I had enough sense to pull myself up and slush my way to the bank

We walked with our bikes instinctively towards home

On the way, I put a seed of guilt on her. If I had seriously injured myself or died, I would've left her with those words and memory that it was her fault. And that is something valuable I learnt. To this day, I always think about how words can impact other people.

When common sense re-entered my brain (and at this point I'd stopped crying)

""Shit

I looked at her. ""What?""

Jasmine glanced over her shoulder again at the two women who had just past us. ""That was Renee's mum.""

""Really? Oh well.""

""You don't understand

That surprised me. How'd she know that a friend of hers mum would tell the school we were not at home. I couldn't comprehend such a nosey person.

""She probably won't


We crossed an old wooden bridge. Right across from it

""Don't

""I won't get busted. Trust me. I'm just going to take a quick shower

""Your brother and sister are home, doubtful I would make it back.

""I'll be fine.""

Let me just say that all her points were valid and that I wasn't willing to see reason whilst I was still soaking wet. I left my bike with her.


You'll be amazed to know, changed, sneaked into the kitchen to grab an apple whilst someone was in the pantry, and left without getting caught. I have no idea how, but I did.

I noticed my sister's rollerblades on the front porch as I left the house and continued down the street where I left my friend. From a distance

I really annoyed my friend by going back

I felt a surge of invincibility

That was when I heard my name. And I knew that voice. And I turned around. And I waved back at my sister like it was nothing... Damn. Let me just say that, of all days, she suddenly does. Funny how that happens.

My sister met us at the end of the street, hadn't exactly seen me but I had left trails. I was relieved to have her laugh about it all instead of yell.

My sister convinced us to go back to the house but Jasmine and I were met with a different reception. My brother was waiting out the front and the first thing he did was yell and say how stupid we were. That's my brother for you... But what I wasn't expecting was how the adult in the house would react. His name was Fred


Strange how we've come full circle. This morning we were worried about being late to school. And now we're worried about being late to school... We were back where we started. Fred was sending us to our graves. But I had an idea.

""It's almost 3, I need to stick around to pick up my brother.""

""Bobby?""

""Yeah."" My younger brother Bobby and I always went home together. There was an alleyway that began at the end of one street and cut across to the highway; directly across from that was the school. ""Let's just wait in the alleyway until the bell rings and wait at the school gates for him."" My friend smiled at me. You don't need to tell me

We approached the end of the alleyway when we heard the intercom of the school come on and make some announcement. ""Would Sandy Morrison and Jasmine Lee come to the school office

I stared at my friend. ""What the hell? How did they know? Do you think Fred rang them to make sure we actually went in? What a douche bag!""

Jasmine shrugged with a sigh. ""My parents are going to freak.""

We were utterly defeated and had no choice but to give ourselves up. We crossed the road and went to the school office
I liked Fred a little more that day and Renee's mum a little less. You can guess how the rest of my day ended.

The cartographer glanced lazily at the ship’s console. The console was a complicated looking collection of screens, as was the boundless swirling space through which he traveled. The brilliance of the stars and the awe-inspiring shooting stars did not faze the cartographer. To think that he had once wanted this job! This demanding job which required endless hours to be spent sitting in the cockpit, to record what was there in the seemingly empty void. At the same time
However, and yet there was nowhere he wanted to go. He couldn’t even resign and go home. After all, how could he return to an ordinary life after has witnessed the extraordinary? To the cartographer space was not a mysterious and inviting world. It wasn’t an exotic ocean with something new to be seen at each and every turn. It was simply a vast collection of repetitive patterns, and infinitely iterated fractal, an art exhibition containing the same painting over and over again, with only a different use of color to differentiate between each painting. Suddenly the sharp voice of the ship’s navigation system cut through the lamenting thoughts of the cartographer.
“Sir
The cartographer thought deeply. What would he have to lose? What would he stand to gain? Would the warp field be a harmless fluctuation in space? Or was it something grander? Perhaps it was sign of the end of the world, the cartographer was looking for any chance to escape his routine life.
“Proceed straight ahead”
Commanded the cartographer. 
The ship headed directly for the center of the fluctuation. The cartographer moved forward in his seat
A bright light exploded out from the center of the warped field. Time and space began to unravel around the cartographer as he watched the dazzling fireworks. The cartographer felt a strange feeling as if he was able to view the universe in its entirety spread out before him. He watched the brilliant stars float beyond him, as if he had been hit by a tremendous force. He was then unconscious.
When he came to, a man wearing a brightly colored robe entered the room. The cartographer looked at the man, aware of his own expression of confusion. He thought he had seen everything in the galaxy, but this was new to him. The man smiled at the cartographer. 
“Welcome to the outside of the universe.”
“The outside?” Asked the cartographer.
“Yes. However you’ll find that there isn’t much difference from the outside and the inside. With one exception.”
The cartographer felt a sudden sting of dismay. He was hoping for something which would defy the confines of the knowledge he owned. He was seeking something beyond the ordinary
“An exception?”
“Yes, to create an infinitely vast space and then define the physical rules of the said space. In order to solve problems of overpopulation we have sent the excess of our people to these simulations. This is the outside, all of the simulations are the various insides. Currently we have 1,485,295 simulated worlds active. However, we sent those people to the simulated worlds long ago, and they seemed to have blended in with the indigenous species in each universe. Now
“Are you trying to say
“No, after how much variation can any species produce? Anyways, all the data collected by each one of the data collectors is transferred back to us via high energy particle transmissions.”
“Ethereal waves?”
“Yes
The cartographer was reminded of the day he first became a cartographer brimming with excitement of the prospect of travelling the universe. Now he would get to see an infinite amount of infinite variation. The cartographer let out a satisfied sigh.  There was much to explore

I guess we’re just not meant to be. I was so sure we were, I can’t stand that we aren’t meant to be. It’s like losing faith. But I guess I have to let go of that the way I have to let go of you. You know, every day I dream about you and me. And you and me don’t exist. At least, not like that. I have to shake that out of my head. So it’s me. It’s my problem.


I can’t forget that time we stayed on the phone till two in the morning, but you left me breathless. I should have told you sooner. I guess I’m telling you now, though, and that must count for something. But I can’t help but feel like it’s too late. It’s so hard to find that place between too soon and too late. I’m not sure it exists, really, if there’s a right time to say I love you. I haven’t found it anyway. I know this is terrible timing but I have to tell you that I love you.


But I have to stop thinking about it, even if it hurts. I have to move on.


I’m sorry I’m telling you all this, but at least for now I need to let you go. I don’t know if I can forgive myself for letting you go, but I have to try to live my own life. I hope you can forgive me.


I love you, but you won’t feel a thing. I’m glad. I wonder if you can even feel this right now. If you can feel me leaving you. Well, in case you can, here’s the ring. I can’t keep it. Not if I’m going to keep going. Not if I’m going to live.


I’ve stayed with you through everything—rich and poor, love.

The days that are not scorched under the burning sun are usually sultry under the oppressive humidity of rain bearing clouds. When it rains, that it is but a wasteland for the peoples populating the more hospitable lands to the south. Neither is it surprising that this land is devoid of humanity.  It’s not that this land is without a strange, obviously



This is why it was so weird that they had left their cozy homes and comfortable jobs in the anonymous suburbia to move here. Mat &amp; Sid’s parents had always romanticized this land. Their youth and naivety had misled them into a notion of freedom in the life off the land under this harsh sun. It would have been ironic


It was a matter of tremendous luck then, he was the king of this realm. No animal could harm him. The shining bright sun that made tinder out of living trees was powerless to make him sweat and the venomous critters were but vermin to be squashed underneath his bare feet. But that is what made him special and especially suitable to live off this land. He was fearless in the face of danger which lurked paralyzingly close. This, in turn, made him able to fetch food, water and shelter at will.


It didn’t come as surprise to Mat that they had a very unusual childhood. They didn’t learn about the world or math or culture, they learnt to kill animals that could kill them and eat the rest. They also learnt to stalk and hunt, to grovel and beg before Bigg for more ideas and when all else failed, to steal – from each other, from other, more formidable, critters. Mat never liked this life and yearned to escape. It’s not that he was ever prevented from escaping, even as a child, was


Despite all his vagaries, no interest in the meat that took a great deal of effort on the part of twins to hunt, but he had great interest in their story of the hunt, and the fact that they did it. While he enjoyed some of the fruits of his own toils, he never grew attached to them, neither did he place a great deal of value in things the twins had obtained at great effort. He was too attached to himself, perhaps. This was another thing that Mat never understood; to him, it’d even more valuable if others valued it too


When the twins were not much more than fifteen, in as much as  he could be said to love anything. But they had increasingly grown distant despite their physical proximity. Mat remembered their first “birthday” in the foster home vividly. They had a hastily baked strawberry shortcake presented to them by their foster family. Sid’s advice was “Mat, enjoy the cake, really taste every bit of it and enjoy it when it’s available. But don’t get addicted to it, don’t remember it and yearn for it. Expectation only brings misery.” This and other such strange things is what made Mat grow tired of his brother.


Initially, feral children – they didn’t belong in civilization. Their history notwithstanding, Mat did remarkably well at school. Sid seem disinterested in what civilization had to teach them. Mat even went to a prestigious college. In college fell in love with a girl and they got married by the time he was in his early twenties. Post education, he took up a job, not much different, perhaps, from his parents’ anonymous vocation. Mat and his wife lived in a suburb, or at least this is how they were to pursue that elusive emotion. In all the years since Mat went off to college, for they were rebellious


Last year, for, in all these years he couldn’t remember a single instance where Sid had asked him for anything, not even to meet him! The conversation they had then was exceedingly strange to Mat, even by the standards of his conversations with Sid. Mat recalled the conversation in his mind.


“How have you been
“I’m alright Sid. In fact I don’t think I’ve ever been happier. What are you doing these days?”
“Oh
“I’m glad to hear that
“I’m content
“Yes
“Indeed
“What is it?”
“It’s just that, just… comfort… or that the social services never found anyone else where we lived…?”
“Well
“Yes
“What? I have my job here
“You don’t have to
“Are you serious?!”
“Yes. Here are the papers.”
“And… what.. what will you do?”
“Oh
“You know you are giving up lots of things. You can have a good life here
“Ah
“What ARE you after?”
“Well… nothing”
“You are crazy”
“So are you


It turned out that Sid’s business was worth millions. Mat would’ve been a fool to not keep it. It annoyed him that Sid didn’t want to be happy, showing them the ropes of surviving the land. He thought to himself “this is a strange land”…

He looks around and somehow I know that he doesn't see any.

Bear nods.

But I see Bear shuffle around and walk into my room. I hear some ruckus and then he's back bringing me a baby-food jar.

Bear doesn't even need to nod. Our thoughts

I notice that he's cleaned out the jar. I don't know how how's managed to do it, find that it has a very pleasing scent. A sort of airy, sunny-day type scent.

   Her best friend

   Her younger sister laid in her bed

   Her parents were in their bedroom

   The air conditioning was on; it had been a hot day. Annabelle pulled the comforter up around her and shot her friend a quick text; she hadn't responded in a while. Annabelle was alone emotionally.

   Music drifted through Annabelle's head

   Annabelle yawned

   Annabelle glanced around her room. Hanging on her white walls were pictures and drawings and letters and posters. Some of it had been given to her by her friends and family

   Closing her eyes for a second, no food, no money. But it could also be better: more friends. No matter how many or how good, Annabelle never felt like it was enough. She didn't necessarily want to be *popular*, but she wanted people from all different groups to like her for who she was.

   A lot of times Annabelle felt like her intelligence created a barrier between her and other people. People would hear about her grades or her ""good girl"" aura before they actually talked to her. She didn't really have any proof

   Annabelle was shy, but when there was an oportunity to dance on camera in band, she was one of only 5 people who refused.

   Annabelle wasn't sure if she was pretty or not. Sometimes, Annabelle thought she was plain. She was pretty convinced this was the truth, and the way everyone saw her. Annabelle didn't think that anyone was beautiful, because to her that was someone with no flaws. Annabelle knew her definition of beautiful was wrong, but she knew she couldn't change it.

   Annabelle didn't know what it meant to be beautiful on the inside. A beautiful soul must be pink and rosy, or even if black wanted to be beautiful. Maybe black loved to be the other side of the coin.

   Love wasn't something Annabelle felt sure about, or even 20. She didn't know what love was. Anyone can find a list of ""symptoms"" of love on the internet, but Annabelle didn't really believe any of it. Was true love even possible?

 The jury stood in the trial room shuffling their papers, occasionally wiping the hot summer sweat off his brow. A quick left-right glance, with head nods of approval, the judge called for proceedings.
“We will make this quick as possible, should there be any, the security will deal with you.” The judge nodded to the jury.

 A posh white man stood up from the front corner of the jury’s seating. “The defendant, Jamie Ellete, representing the general public, for roughly eight counts of repeated killings and counting. The deaths of Jay M. Lee, Cynthia Jonnas, Lam Soo Youk, Tyler Goust, Lee Engal, after reports of serial murders across several provinces and states in the U.S. and Canada, and suffered death by electrocution via crude head attachments. There is no record for DNA on the victims

The jury announced
“So

“My client would like to plead not guilty.” Said Sampson’s lawyer, and patting his cheeks, he quickly passed a look of ‘I got this’ towards Sampson, who was arrested, is bound to a dolly. Strapped down and mouth covered with a muzzle, already in an orange jumper from his night’s stay in a maximum security cell. He sweated, eyes moved franticly about, he shook about. Security didn’t stand too far

“My client, your honor. Now with that in the air, why would a man, who spent money, time and endless effort to get a job in such a field, throw it away for a senseless killing spree? If you roll it in your head, it becomes clear, you are charging a man with no criminal record to a crime that he did not commit? Truly my client has either been framed

The judge leaned back in his seat. “Mmm

“Mr. Ruth. Timothy Darnell Ruth.” 

“Righty then. Alright

Standing from the opposing table, and a hair band. A pair of glasses sat on the table in front of her. Her lawyer stood up. 

“To make things clear, she recordings walking into a room at an office, in which Sampson was engaged in a game of truth or dare with several other party members. The game, as one would assume requires one to chose between a dare, or to answer a question that they are asked. Apparently, she was the last person, along with Sampson to play. She agreed in doing a dare, she was trapped by a one-way door which the handle, whispered something to her, and was able to protect Jamie

Gerald sat back down beside Jamie

“Excellent

“Yes your honor. I would like to call Jamie to the stand; provided she is able.” Timothy said passing a caring glance at Jamie. She stared, trying to block out the sight of Sampson, who sat in the stand in front of her.

“Now Jamie

Jamie’s lips trembled. “H-He was... maybe tall—wore a suit
no question to it... he had hair; it was too dark to see its colour—“ she went silent for a moment.

Suddenly
“Hmmm. Your honor

“Nonsense.” The judge said. “You have evidence pressed by other lawyers and police officials.”

“Your honor

“Mr. Ruth. Sit down.”

“Sir I-“

“Sit.”

Timothy sat back down in the booth.
“Now, and begin your final verdict. Sampson wailed and struggled violently in his restraints, 
“Wait, and clatter, falling off, Sampson screamed “It wasn’t ME! I’m framed! You all are insane!”

“Mr. Nettle. If you believe you are an innocent man

“I- Don’t- KNOW! It wasn’t me! I swear!” he shook and moved erratically

“That’s enough, Sampson wailed again
“No! No! Fuck you people! All of you are pigs- you’re all insane! You’re all going to hell for this! To he—mfmrmm!!”

“Listen to him

With a quick bang of the gavel the court was quiet again. The judge looked down towards Sampson in pity. “The jury may continue to the room.”

Time passed slowly. The mid-day light turned to orange sunset

“Have you reached a consensus?” the judge asked

“Yes, to receive the death penalty.”

Sampson wailed again. The dolly fell over

“Alright. Mr.Nettle. your death will be scheduled as soon as possible. May god have mercy on your soul.”

Sampson was escorted out of the hall. Ruth stood close to him
“I’m sorry Sampson. I did what I could with what information I had.” 

All Sampson did was weep quietly behind his muzzle...
*       			*			*			*			*



The next day, releasing musky air that only a man of death would care to ignore. Removed of his strappings, he sat quietly. Tears ran down his face, only to be seen by security and the families of the deceased. Timothy stood in the corner of the room, near the security officer near a lever. A priest came to Sampson, blessed him and offered Sampson a last confession. 

“...I didn’t do it...” Is all Sampson said. The priest nodded

“Sampson Nettle. Your earthly judgement has come. Any final words?” the officer near the lever said. Sampson just shook his head.

“Actually
“Thank you... Timothy
“Yes. But I need to ask you something.” Timothy stated.

“Yeah. Shoot

“Yeah

“Well

“Just answer a simple question. Truth. Or Dare?”

“...Truth- What the fuck are you going on about?”

“Just answer the question.”

“...Fucking dare; not like I’ll be able to do it.”

“I dare you to keep as quiet as possible.”

Sampson’s eyes widened...

“You mother fucker- you mother FUCKER!!” Sampson raised his body of the seat as far as he could

“Security!”

The guards ran in and detained Sampson

“Fuck you! You slimy bastard—It was him! He killed all those people! That shit- Kill him!” Sampson pointed with his loose finger. Timothy looked empathetic

Sampson was strapped to a point where he could not move at all. That’s when security began to hook up the device. An officer walked off to the side where they kept the machine.

“Crap

An onlooker took out a bobby pin from her purse. A simple metal attachment.

“How the fuck did you do it—How! You son of a bitch—How! Tell me!!” Sampson yelled.

“That’ll do; we need to fix this stupid thing.” He took it from her and brought it back into the room. Then he wheeled it out. Old and worn, and the other a metal cup and bobby pin; an attachment for an electric chair.

“No- Fuck YOU! FUCK ALL OF YOU- YOU’RE MAKING A MISTAKE!” Sampson wailed as he moved his fingers and feet about

Timothy left the room.

“Get back here!! Now! You son of a bitch! Back—Ge- Get him!”

“You will be silenced soon

The end is no fault of yours, but also hope to never know. If you feel like I do, just show me a sign. Anything. But you won’t. Who’s to say you don’t have the same sleepless nights? You might. But my suspicion is you don’t. And knowing that for sure is a thousand times worse than not knowing. 
    
   I try to recreate the past- mostly arguments. Why couldn’t they have ended better? Either way, yet I always just agreed. I was blinded by love. Now that the rose colored glasses are gone, I realize that isn’t true. My feelings are equal to those of everyone else.

I was sitting in the living room with my arms crossed when Grandpa gathered the family around the dining room table. Grandpa was a giant of a man, with big pauses between each phrase, “someone attempt to balance this egg upright, without using any tools to hold it up.”

The whiteness of the egg stood out in Grandpa’s wrinkled and purple spotted hands. It seemed so small. I studied the egg while my family began to buzz. My older cousin smirked and whispered something in my Dad’s ears that made him laugh. Uncle Joe was doing one of his James Cagney impressions to my brother and cousin. Aunt Anna had walked in the room from cooking and chuckled when she saw my grandpa holding the egg. 

I was the only one paying attention, “I can do it!”

My grandpa’s heavy eyes shifted to me and his lips peeled into a grin, handed me the egg. I began working right away.

I made quick glances to Grandpa as I tried to balance it, “oh so close,” several times with a laugh while Uncle David commentated like a sports announcer, “Jake Lacey. Balancing the egg. Can he do it? Ah, keeps missing.”

After several minutes my older cousin said, “Hun, you can try later, it’s fine,” the doubt became harder to ignore. 

“Let me just try!” I said

Eventually my Uncle Joe stopped impersonating James Cagney. My father raised his eye brows and stood up from the table and my brother began to attack me. “Jake you can’t do it.”

“Don’t worry

I wanted to shut my family up and make them see that I could do it. I wanted them to know that just I could complete a task that was impossible for most. And I did. 

I finally stood the egg up right. It wasn’t balancing against anything; it was just standing up on its own. All because of me. I looked up in amazement, half of them were gone and the other half had already moved on to new conversations. Only my cousin Rachel said, “Wow! Look guys! Jake did it!” 

As Rachel began to get my family’s attention I looked to Grandpa who was not grinning but seemed thrown by the egg standing up. As I waited for a response from Grandpa

Before they could all see what I had done, leaving the egg’s bottom flat surfaced with a crack, placed the it on the table, and forced a chuckle as everyone watched the egg stand up on its own. He said, “That is how you make an egg stand.”

He approaches the bartender and takes a seat on the stool, tap, tap*. “Enjoy” she says, he won’t though. They seem as though they are the bottomless abyss, gazing into the drinks he wonders where things went wrong, how everything got so fucked up.

“Happy birthday Johann, all aboard!” He’s mesmerized by it, grabbing his favourite toy truck he plays with the toy train, chasing it with the truck and crashing them together.

*Gulp, please”.

“Come on Johann! We all did it.” Johann pedals on his older brothers bike, wind rushing past his face as his peripherals turn to a blur, the view getting steeper and steeper as he goes downhill. As the ground begins to level out he sees the jump ahead, won’t be long now. A dirt mound lies ahead, might as well be a mountain. 


Freedom, he knew he could. “Ok guys I have to go home for dinner” said Johann. As he pulls into the driveway and puts his bike in the garage he sees his father looking out the front window as usual; just watching. 

*Gulp.*

Steak and potatoes for dinner, I don’t want some 30 year old loser living here. You’ll be sitting there hanging your head between your legs when your 35 because you never amounted to anything” said his father. Angry, Johann runs upstairs to his room. His safe haven, the only place he can find solace in this house. “Don, why do you drink so much? That was a really mean thing to say he never even said anything.” “Oh shut up, you’re a fucking slug. Lost your job because you’re incompetent and now you collect disability, all I do is work and deal with fucking assholes all day.” 

6 years it’s been like this, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump* he hears as his father makes his way up the stairs in his drunken state, the inevitable. He’s coming into his room, then he would go through all the problems life has provided for him

He’s 18 years old now

“My dad’s drunk as hell man, rum and coke is their drink of choice. They go to the house party, friends, girls, booze and cocaine; none in short supply. Drink after drink and line after line they party until the sun comes up. Johann, in college now is working towards his diploma. Such is the way things are when you’re that age partying and college seem to go together nicely. 3 years go by and with great satisfaction and pride, at the age of 21 he receives his diploma.

*Gulp*

He comes home to see a note on the kitchen table *“Had to take your father to the hospital”*. This is strange, he’s happy about this. “I’m going to take care of some things in the back yard” said Johann’s father. After an hour or so Johann goes to see if he needs help, but something is different about his dad. He’s drunk *“What an idiot”* he thinks to himself as he’s walking away in disappointment. He leaves soon after to go and party with his friends, alcohol and cocaine once again. For the next 2 weeks his father is in searing pain because of the drinking. This is the way things are for the next year with his father, pain, then recovery then alcohol, then pain. It stops eventually though.
For Johann the partying continues, alcohol and cocaine. Sometimes it’s only alcohol or cocaine, sometimes both.

*Gulp.*


Since he was 18 he’s been drinking and staying out on weekends, he doesn’t know anyone to get cocaine from but every weekend the partying continues day drinking is ever more prevalent. 

*26 years old, 29 years old, 30 years…*

*Gulp.* “Thanks
He walks into his apartment

I saw the whole thing and I’m the only one who knows what happened. I followed those two inside that house

I knew Alex and Julius from our ninth grade Algebra class we had together last year. They used to cheat off of each other during the weekly quizzes. They both lived a couple blocks away from me in our neighborhood

I had just parked my car in front of my house and was getting ready to get out of it and head inside when I saw the two of them biking down the street on Friday night. They were wearing all black outfits. I thought that perhaps they were headed to the park or to the 7-11 to get a snack. But then I saw them stop just feet away from my car and get off their bikes. They then hid their bikes in the bushes in the lawn of the big house across the street from mine. They didn’t realize I was watching them from my car window as they then began to walk up towards the house.

The house that they were walking towards used to belong to a family that was made up of Mr. and Mrs. McKinley and their two children. The McKinley’s had lived there until the mother

&lt;Diary entry for October 5
I was outside playing basketball in the driveway when Mr. McKinley had just come home from work around 6:00p.m. He tried to open the garage door from the remote in his car as he always did but the garage door was stuck and would not open. He got out of his car and slowly pulled up the handle on the garage door. This grabbed my attention because I remember that as he pulled up the garage door, Mr. McKinley realized there was a hanging body in the garage and ran inside it and started screaming. I ran over to the bottom of their driveway. I saw the face of the lady and realized that it was Mrs. McKinley’s.
&lt;End diary entry&gt;

A couple of weeks after the suicide happened, a realtor about a year ago. I had been very curious about what it was like inside that home since the suicide had happened.

The first thing that Alex and Julius did was go up to the door leading into the garage. I thought that perhaps they were aware of what Mrs. McKinley did in there and wanted to get in to see where it had happened first hand. It appeared that they were fiddling with the lock and trying to open the door when they heard a bird and jumped behind a couple of bushes. They then wandered back behind the home with the moonlight guiding their way. That’s when I decided to follow them to see what they were doing.

I waited about five minutes in my car and figured that they had made it inside when I didn’t see them come back for their bikes. I got out of my car and ran back behind the big house just as they had moments earlier. I jumped the fence leading to the back yard and landed in some weeds that were about as tall as me. That and the darkness made it nearly impossible to figure out where I was going. I slowly walked along the back of the home looking for a back door entrance. I had arrived at the door. At first I didn’t notice anything weird but after a closer inspection

At that moment I had to stop and think if this was really something that I wanted to go through with. If I turned around right then and there and pretended that nothing had happened

Once I stepped inside the house

When I reached the bottom of the stairwell, and noticed it was what looked to be a puddle of blood. I screamed so loud that anyone inside of that house would have heard me and if Alex and Julius were just upstairs, they would have heard it for sure. I paused and just stood completely still, listening for movement. It had only been about a minute but it felt like an eternity. Then I heard the blower noise start again coming from upstairs so I started to go up them.

The first few steps didn’t make any noise but around the fifth or sixth step, stair fourteen, I counted as I heard every creek, taking into account the first few steps that didn’t make any noise. I made it up to about stair twenty and thought that by then I should have definitely made it to the next floor. I shined my weakly dimmed flashlight up towards the top and saw about five more stairs and then a sea of darkness. Five stairs was about as far as my flashlight would shine. As I continued up about twenty more stairs, there was that odd blower noise again. It was louder this time and felt more like it was coming from around me and not above me. This made me think that the top of the stairs were getting close now. There were about ten more stairs I climbed before I had reached the top. There was a hallway going left and right.

At this point I was very frightened but didn’t want to turn around. I whispered Alex’s and Julius’ name but didn’t hear anything so I turned left towards what looked to be a bedroom. I looked around and saw a bed and dresser. The dresser had a pile of clothes on it as if someone had been living there. I turned back out of the bedroom and walked down the hallway

I went right and heard the blower noise again. This time it was louder than ever. It was coming from behind a closed door at the end of the hallway. I could tell that there was a light on in the room because I saw it coming through the crack below the door. I got close to the door and put my ear up against it. There was really not much to hear until the blower noise started yet again. I slowly put my hand on the cold doorknob and began to turn it. I was doing a great job of not making any noise as I turned the knob. My heart was beating like a drum. As I slowly pushed open the door

I could tell from the size of the room that this was the master bedroom. The door was now open all the way. I walked in and looked to the left and saw a person wearing what looked to be a wig sitting down at a desk beside the bed. They were wearing an old red night gown and had black gloves on, slow groaning noise.

That was all I needed to hear before I ran out of the door and down the hallway as fast as I could. I turned left and started down the stairs. I remembered how many stairs there were going up but now there seemed like there were even more, I turned left and went through a room that I hadn’t been in before. I was too discombobulated to remember the way I came into the house at the time and I needed to get out of there as quickly as possible. There was a door straight ahead and I opened it. It had a window in it and it looked like a laundry room. I ran through that and opened the next door that was locked from the inside.

The moonlight was a little bit brighter in this next room. I then realized from the line of horizontal windows that I wasn’t in a room at all, found it, and slapped it as hard as I could. Instantly the garage light came on and that’s when I saw Alex and Julius. They were hanging from the track on the ceiling of the garage in the same spot Mrs. McKinley was two years earlier. They were hanging there lifeless, with nooses around their necks.

I heard that same grinding noise that I had heard when Mr. McKinley had just got home to discover his wife. The garage wouldn’t open. The loud groaning noise could be heard from behind me and I felt warm air run down my back. I ran towards the garage door

I was contemplating calling the police but thought that if I did

The next morning, on Sunday, Alex and Julius were reported missing. I am going to keep the secret of what I saw inside that home forever. I’m afraid that what I saw last week may haunt me for the rest of my life.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1fskze/after_reading_stephen_king_i_was_inspired_to/

Sounds of gunfire pierced the air of the turbulent world outside. The shots echoed off the towering glass skyscrapers and crouching cement apartment buildings. The sounds of car horns and their obnoxious owners drifted through the city. The factories of industry belched smog into the morning air, he meticulously rubbed the sleep from his eyes. His rotund form shifted on the sofa as he turned over to look at the time on his digital clock. To him the little clock was a piece of the past, something from before the TV and computer screens. He grabbed the controller wedged between his meaty leg and the arm of the sofa. Suddenly an enormous screen turned on bathing his dark apartment in artificial light. Then another screen turned on, flashing a commercial for a blender, soon nine colossal screens were flickering and chattering away. Gavin flicked through the TV channels until he found the news channel. Scenes of the destruction and carnage of a middle eastern village washed over the apartment. A smile  formed on Gavin's face, as he recognized the inferno as his work. He looked over at his outdated clock. His smile vanished in an instant when he realized he was late for work. Using his black console controller Gavin entered into the United States Air Force flight screen. The screens became one large screen as they flashed the United States seal before melting into a map of the Middle East. The map was riddled with red dots showing where attacks were occurring live and in real time. 
                   Gavin was part of the Civilian Drone Pilot Program, polished and sharp Drone officer who had come to visit his high school. Gavin was an overweight senior whose C average grades were not good enough for the high demand of doctors and lawyers. He was unsure of what to do after high school. His only passion were his video games. Gavin enlisted in the program and went through the years of classes and hours flight simulations. He was finally qualified for the 16th Unmanned Airborne Division. Though Gavin did not wear a physical uniform or pin golden medals on his chest, he still had pride in his country and his reputation on the drone chat logs. He was a decorated war hero who had conducted more than 2,397 Drone Strikes and 5,634 Spy Operations. He was at the top of the Drone leader boards and had unlocked all of the medals in the Drone program. Now he was an elite pilot who lead coordinated attacks, straight from the Pentagon. 
                           A notification appeared in the top left corner of the screen. Gavin toggled over to the notification. Immediately a video began to play. The images of a map and flight patterns materialized on the screens. A robotic female voice spoke and began to recite the mission details.
 ""You will be flying an offensive strike over a large urban target. Your first objective is to destroy the power station located in quadrant R3 on your map. Your second and third targets are two large skyscrapers located in quadrant R4. Your initial pay out if all 3 mission objectives are completed is $510,000 dollars he got if he completed the mission. It seemed simple enough. Gavin toggled over to the mission description and glanced over the briefing and memorized the three objectives. Eliminate the two target structures in the center of the city with minimal casualties and disable the cities power grid by eliminating the central power station. Gavin pressed the controller's buttons to accept the mission. His screen froze as the lengthy mission acceptance paperwork was loaded onto his screen. The importance of the 20 page flight contract was lost on Gavin, it was a nuisance. A male voice began to read off the carefully worded flight waiver. As the voice droned on in the background, Gavin leaned over to a table near his sofa and snatched up a half eaten microwave burrito. He gobbled up the remaining half in two quick bites before being interrupted by the robotic voice.
""Do you Gavin Pratt accept the terms stated in the contract that has been read to you?""
A ping sounded to cue him to speak into the blue tooth headset. Gavin spoke spewing ground meat and beans onto his stained shirt. ""I Gavin Pratt accept the terms read to me.""
A loading circle spun on the screen as Gavin finished off another microwave burrito. His screen soon showed a high definition panoramic view of a eerily empty runway. Due to the sensitivity of the mission Gavin was not allowed to speak to air traffic control and he began his pre flight check in silence. Though Gavin had never seen his drone in person he loved his drone as though it was the son he would never have. The sleek white aircraft was one of the most agile of its kind. When he had completed the pre flight diagnostics the drone turned on its engines. This was always a moment of joy for Gavin. He lightly pushed the toggle button on his controller urging the drone to pick up speed. The drone began its race down the runway and he watched as the drone leapt from the Tarmac and into the overcast morning sky. A message flashed on the screen, would put the drone on auto pilot while he fell asleep to the soothing light of the flickering screens. Thankfully the destination was only few minutes away, and already Gavin could see the 3D satellite images of robotics factories and the sprawling slums surrounding the center of the city below. Two of the smaller skyscrapers were outlined in red identifying them as his mission objectives. Beneath Gavin's large soft exterior was the cruel nature of a sadistic boy who kills insects to watch them suffer. Gavin veered his drone towards the center of city where the smoke stacks of the power station that billowed smoke lay outlined in the red lines. It was his first target. He rubbed his thumb over the fire button. The HD video showed the tiny civilians scrambling about the city like aimless insects without a purpose. Gavin pushed lightly on the button and a single bomb dropped from the drone and Gavin watched as it fell. The bomb shrunk as it moved farther and farther away from the drone's camera. Then the screens were illuminated with a flash and the screen went dark. 
                   His apartment shook violently as Gavin was whipped from his sofa landing in a helpless heap on the ground. All nine of Gavin screens fell on the floor and shattered. The apartment windows imploded letting the sour smell of plastic and crumbling concrete fill Gavin's apartment. The windows that had kept Gavin from hearing and seeing the violent cacophony of the outside world were reduced to shards and pulverized dust. Gavin could not pull his immense weight up to see what had happened. Screams and the shrill whine of sirens filled his apartment. He was experiencing the sensory overload that no video game or tv show could offer. Breathing heavily he finally pulled himself up to the window, as though stuck in a trance as he watched the drone gracefully fall through the air. It plunged into the glass windows of the skyscraper. A brilliant blossom of red and orange consumed the building and Gavin with it. Gavin had almost experienced the most real and thrilling scenario he had ever had, almost like one of his video games.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1fmfca/looking_for_some_feedback/

A transient breeze puffed from the glen off his right shoulder, but the dry, like a good parent or the law, was calmly and firmly inescapable.  He had maybe an afternoon’s worth of water.

It was with a translucent nausea which was the mating of vaporized oil, brow furrowed, staring at the laminated countertop.  There was not much for him here, the marginal gains of this place rapidly diminishing.  There was not nothing, but there were few sounds, and the topographical features were more gestures of the hand than the arm.  The plains were insistent and subtle, the people slow, and intimidating.  As though they either had what they wanted or could not know that they didn’t.  Rooted people.  There were no mechanics.

And he sought to go.  Before this he had been in school.  He had married.  He had worked. Those were all things he did back East

With an impatient click of the tongue and a fumbling for change, quiet street.  There was no gravity for people like him.  

He would probably make it anyhow.  A slow oil leak was mostly an annoyance to him, blackened eucharist as it flowed down the crank case.  A narcotic mating of rider and machine.  The leak seemed unfortunate but not fatal.  Not much to differentiate this run and the last, and Little Hook was close at hand.  He had set off and made good progress through most of the morning before the holy ghost in his motorcycle deserted him.

The road was cracked, crumbling at its edges as the earth regained its grip under the asphalt.  The pavement sloped upwards, straight and rolling gently like a long, cartoon tongue.  The tar snakes had melted and clung to the bottoms of his boots.  He lifted his feet with labor, dismounted, and got on one knee to peer at the salt-caked workings of the motorcycle.  Low fuel?  Seized?  Seals?  He couldn’t know, but it was nothing he could see.  A wipe of the brow.  A sip of water.  He looked once at the sky without a breath, and began to study.",t5_2qhmi,True
1369983582.0,1fe3s1,"Probably quite bad, but I really enjoyed writing it... My first short story is kind of a nice, feel-good story",shortstory_m,4,0, perhaps an obsession. We were going around three times a week

We showed up and went downstairs to our two usual tables. The girls arrived a few minutes later and it was fun for a while. It was clear that the guys were a little more focused on their ""game"" rather than on running the table. However, and this night soon became a prime example of that. In came a large, boisterous, extremely round man with one of those beards that look like he tried to replicate his buzz-cut on the lower side of his head as well. He was with an equally shady looking guy of average height, muscular build, and a clear Italian background. Of course, they came downstairs and set up at one of the two remaining tables in the room right next to us. I thought I was being paranoid but I could tell that they would be trouble. They'd only been here for two minutes and already discussed ""Rachel"" and her apparent slutiness loudly enough for the entire pool hall to hear, and by the beer pitcher brought with them from the adjacent bar

I tried to ignore them until I had a reason not to, the old man practicing alone, and of course, us. They weren't there to play pool, for all we knew they were only here because they got kicked out of some other place. I appeared to be the only one who really took much notice; everyone else was having a good time playing still. I beat Dan twice and I was feeling pretty good about myself until I realized that appearing good at pool isn't really much more attractive to girls than being average at pool.

It only took a few games before it started. Sure enough, hunny?"" and looking to his buddy, ""I'd like to tap that."" Thunderous laughter among the two of them for round guy's bout of comedy genius. Sarah becomes very clearly embarrassed and angry, but we all try to ignore it and hope that's the last of it. Dan lines up for a shot and round guy pulls his cue just as he goes to hit the ball and of course this is followed by more laughter. More comments come our way, particularly towards Dan's ""greaseball"" hair, my apparently ""stuck up rich-kid"" look, Sarah's ass, the more ""macho"", he was kind of a jerk, clearly intimidated by the two thugs. They could barely contain their laughter enough to manage a response. It was hopeless. Steve began to gather our things

Mike, as he was driving an old Camaro and pulled up right next to the big window by the entrance. It was an unusual car for him, Mike was known for being really shy and avoided conflict always, so this screaming muscle-car was a bit out of character. He'd made money on the internet somehow and fixed this up last year, Junior year. Of course, he went right up to Sarah as he arrived. Everyone knew he was crazy about Sarah, but she was a bit out of his league. They were friends and he took her to prom,"" I heard him ask her quietly, he was one of the most mellow, perhaps for the second time in his life. He just stared off into space for a while

The insults were all directed right at Mike now. Maybe this was his plan, you drive that piece of shit this smooth?"" and Mike turned around. ""Look, that's enough. Clearly we all can't be here at the same time. Let's play for it, $20 and the loser leaves."" This was all directed right at round guy, who fell right for it. Barely able to contain himself, thinking he's frustrated this kid into giving up easy money, he agrees. ""Sure kid, ""You hear that Aaron, he knew Mike. Aaron was almost a professional player

So they played. ""I'll give us a good break, he already knew it was all going to work. The game was over even sooner than it had began. In  a stark contrast to his previous game, Mike pocked four balls in his first turn after round guy's fruitless break. After one more turn each, round guy had five balls remaining and Mike was ready to pocket his final solid ball. ""The little shit hustled me."" ""Ya think?"" Mike fired off as he looked directly at the drunken pair and not at the shot he sunk. In perfect position for the 8-ball, Mike smiled over at us and finished the game.

""Funny thing is, but Aaron's approach and support from his buddy was enough to usher the pair out the door, of course while chucking an empty soda bottle at us and ignoring their playing fees. Everyone was ecstatic, a few of the girls hugged Mike and there were all kinds of high-fives, thanks, and general excitement among the group. Mike could do nothing but smile and take it like he always took any kind of compliment, humbly. I could tell he was only thinking about one thing. Sarah looked at Mike like she never had before, so I knew something was different. They're dating now, he finally got the impossible girl he was always haplessly enamored with. ",t5_2qhmi

There was an abundance of fog, breathing thing. Many houses were in disrepair

My name is Siegfried Möller. My home from which I am thoroughly misplaced from is Langenburg, and set out for the first house. 6503 was imprinted on the door, the 3 hanging off it’s hinge. I read the note, “Remember to thaw out the chicken! Love, Mom”

That is rather ordinary, with lack of any alternative. The next note said “Log 5/30/27: The tests have been going at an adequate pace. The virus is manifesting from the subject from across the road. It won’t be very long. R. Burke- out.” This may be a clue as to what happened here. I continued down the road, the notes getting further along time, and darker as I progressed. From the simple note from a mother, to the doctor’s logs, to people in panic, to finally dwindling survivor groups at the end of the road. There was one final, with a black note firmly placed on the door, although they may have been at one point. I ran through the forest

I awoke. I felt a great chill in the air, through the wood planks I was sitting on. The ground is so far away. That is when I realized. This is the city of Rothenburg, recently industrialized. And I am 300 feet from the ground. My fear of heights got the best of me, I could not move. I was on the outskirts of town, with a chain link fence behind me. I started to walk along the planks. This is the place I used to be with my friends in, used to have fun in. As I walked around a corner, I heard something behind me. The distinctive noise I heard, but could not place now. Then as it got colder, going straight through buildings as if they weren’t there. I increased my pace. I jumped on the smaller rooftops, they couldn’t have been ten feet away from me. I vaulted off of the current rooftop

I had always been opposed to violent weapons, where many bought groceries and the like. It was now deserted, and mysteriously so. I hadn’t eaten or drank anything for a very long time, and I was already mentally unstable before this. I was hearing things... or was I? Maybe the things I heard or the things I saw were, in fact, of my own imagination. What if this was a dream? I thought better of it, although the thought lingered in the back of my mind for quite some time. I checked my pockets, that I had lost all other items that typically were in my pockets, I have thought up crazier things, Charlotte responded

Or so I thought.

1369392179.0,1eypl7,Luciana of Sivlaatar,thirdrealm,4,2,1,"Luciana of Sivlaatar, she knew the prize and yet getting fucked by this ugly old man made her feel a bit disgusted. At least I still feel something. She slowly caressed his back and then reached his back pocket on his half-undressed coat


She now slipped her clothes back on and all the while molested the key in her hand with surprising lack of feelings. Why is it this easy with all the men?  She combed her hair, who as it happens was the sole owner of the most valuable safety box in the safe. Of course, she could pick the lock of the safe and then do the same with the safe box, it would take time and effort though, while picking up the mayor and consequently taking his key took her less than twenty minutes. These men, all the centuries ran past and they are still the same.

She hid the corpse under the bed, it was one of the few feelings that she still could recognize, feel and respond to, a being alive more than two thousand years has not much left to enjoy during her life, but this, this she could still enjoy as much as always. She collected artefacts from the Age of One, from her youth; she collected them as memories, and hoped to find answers to her life.

Her hearth rate slowly rose with anticipation, as if to prevent its breaking, yet the box was a full metal sturdy safe with good ten centimetres thick sides. Now, yes, now I can feel it. She inserted the key in the keyhole and turned it so slow that she could hear even the slightest sounds of the lock being opened. It was a moment when something you could almost call a smile emerged on her otherwise indifferent looking face. She took of the lid and turned the box upside down to quicken the emptying process. A bunch of documents that meant immense wealth and a few pieces of diamond jewellery fell out. Is this just to make me angry old man? Why do you give me this junk? She briefly looked at the legs under the bed and then back at the box. She noticed right away and started to remove the fake bottom of the safe with newly found enthusiasm. As she uncovered the slim wooden desk that separated the secret space from the outside world she felt her heart rate rise again and savoured the feeling of being alive, she did not feel this good in a long time.

But then, she clenched it in her fist as hard as she could and then stuffed it into the majors’ mouth. Then she kicked him in his head with a fury of a dragon. She was kicking him while the words in the note were keep popping up in her head. “I ride the dark, I eat my shadow,” her pointy shoe broke into the major’s skull and she charged another mighty kick, “for I have come from words down, below,” now she could see his eyes leaping out as she kicked them from inside out, “My touch sinister, for I’ve just begun.” with a loud splash the remains of majors’ head detached themselves from the rest of the body and flew out of the window.

She jumped out after the head, were flowing freely in the wind as she rode her horse back home, her almost perfectly white skin contrasting with the hair. The skin gleamed as the moonlight reflected itself in her face, thinking that it is honoured to fall upon such beauty. Her pale green eyes were now looking straight towards the forest. She needed to calm down somewhere and think and there was no better place than home to do so. Her black dress with red embroidery and white lace was almost like a princesses’, she did not really need it but if felt good to be admired, and she could almost hear the trees sigh in awe.

The hut, a forest no one dared to venture in, for forces of magic and unknown were manifesting their power between the dark trees, bending the reality at their will. In a carefully picked location, at the intersection of energy currents which ran through the earth the hut collected that energy and supplied its mistress with it. The spot had one more advantage, it was remote from everybody and everything and thus was very hard to find. From the outside, the hut looked more like a shack about to fall. But behind the door there was an interior of a completely different kind, ages and materials which they were made from. The arched ceiling gave off the feeling of majesty; at the end of the hallway was a single room

A fairly large room stuffed with items of various quality and value, only a small crack in the wall directly in the direction the hilt was facing hinted that the blade is present none the less.

Luciana opened the door to her bedroom and marvelled at her treasures, detailed, painting folded in the shape of an orb, but the painting was torn to pieces, which were still floating around the edge of the orb. It was a map of the known plains; an item of tremendous power for it stored a portion of the Earth’s magic in its elaborate design.

Millennia ago, islands, rocks, that were floating around their own rock were kept in their paths circling around the planet’s core. People from the times when the world was one were soon forgotten and so was the fact that on many of the other planes, other creatures live as well. Whole nations became self-contained on their own piece of rock and with no means to explore the other planes they simply lived their lives with what they had. Of course, from time to time an adventurous soul emerged from the crown and tried to leap across the magic eruptions which separated the planes. It looked like lava searing out of a volcano. But nothing could hold these explorers back. So they took a magic embroidered rope and hurled it to the other side. Then, trying the firmness of the anchorage on the other side they leapt, of course

The small room was lit by the light exploding from the sphere, and then the light disappeared, the pieces of paper flew away and scattered on the ground leaving the room helplessly dark and empty. She conjured a light in her palm and looked at the table, where the orb was calmly spinning just a few seconds ago. A note reading

I ride the dark

for I have come from words down

my touch sinister

find me young child

As soon as she finished reading the note, she felt as if she’s being pressed by between two walls, just before she fainted she used her last breath to shout out loud.

“Luciana of the One will destroy you!”

1369168610.0,1escq0,Dawn of the Night Age (x-post from /r/writing),OceanCarlisle,2,0,1,"*Hello, and I can take criticism so please be honest. Thanks* 

All day the sun burned furiously hot, and thirst to all those unlucky enough to be under its power. There would be no darkness tonight; the sun was not going to let a little thing like the post meridian tell it to stop shining, burning, and suffocating the denizens of Little Rock. 

Before the Age turned, but now, in the Dusk Age, day and night were separated by days and sometimes a full week. 

Cammy often wondered what it must have been like to live in the Noon Age, longing for a return to the days of the Noon Age. The changes had been so subtle at first that the educated people of the Noon days chalked it up to a random aberration. When the changes became more pronounced, they investigated for any breaches or alterations in their systems. Then one day, the Age turned, everything broke, and nothing was ever the same. 

“Don’t start crying again.” Jason

“Excuse me?” she answered. She hadn’t heard him come into the kitchen where she sat at their copper-top table

“For a second there

Granted, and worse, she did know what face he meant—an oft discussed family trait—but she could not let him know that; she was supposed to be the strong one, and he wasn’t supposed to be so damn observant.

“Halve off!” she told him

“If I cut myself like the Dusky Downers do

“Just leave me alone

Knifing me in the back might be kinder than your constant disproval of the way I make money for us all; the money that buys your clothes


“Leave… me…”

“Maybe

Nodding was the only response he got

“Older men, and they guided themselves through life with wonder, fantasies, and false emotions.”

“Perhaps, there was the Noon Age,” she continued for him “when everyday dawned and dusked brightly, and by understanding and utilizing the sciences of Earth, men were able to reach beyond it, to not only map the stars, but to see them, collect them from,” she concluded “we are in the Dusk Age, and has changed all the rules of its sciences. What little fragments we have left of the Noon age are mostly useless to us

Quietly

“Really?” Cammy asked, here he was crying, as if… “If this is just you playing some stupid game with me!” she erupted suddenly.

“Sit down

The fear in his voice was more than enough to make her obey

“Under all the talk of relearned sciences, there is a deep fear of the next Age. Think about it, Cammy, what comes after dusk? Night” he answered himself. “Our nights may either be full of sun or wholly absent of it, but in the Night Age, will there be any day? How will humanity survive without sunlight? We have already seen how the flora and fauna adapted to the changing of the Age, but humans, were left blind-sided, blind

“Very good, keeping her skepticism forefront “but there was night in the Dawn Age, so why not dawn in the Night Age? And each age lasted for few millennia, while this one is only a few hundred years old, what’s the worry? Why did you cry?” The last was her real question, the only reason she was still having this discussion and had not just walked away from another of his wild—possibly just to mess with her—stories. 

“What came before the Dawn Age?” he asked her in the stoic, but it still confers the meaning; The Dark Ages. They also called that Noon Age the Golden Age, and thought nothing of the previous Dawn. More importantly, there was nothing of the Dusk. It is impossible to know if any of their sciences changed as they had only just begun to scratch the surface of science, and the stars stay constant, so their mapping is the same as ours, but changes occurred, wealth, Night fell and wiped it all away, and the biology of all living organisms on Earth—besides humanity—changed to adapt to the new environment

“X” Cammy told him when he started to cry again

“Zora” they said together as they heard the front door open and close. Their mother, and they had to release their embrace and dry their tears before she got upset, and became useless for days. 

“Anyone home?” she called out from the foyer. “I have dinner for my two happy children!”

Blood squirting from the crater on the cpl’s head as the heart clamored for life.

“I’m no hero”, but his own engine had been awakened by primordial fear. Fear of the shadows. Fear of the footsteps. Fear of the gunshots he could hear coming from distant corners of the battleship.

Ed tried to work some magic, too, and we talked about growing up and being friends and how Al always felt like an outsider. I commiserated, but every wrong answer resulted in a knick. The blood was starting to drip from my neck.

Patrick began giggling. Maybe he was feeling the mushrooms. Maybe the whole situation was too much. Maybe he was just plain fucking crazy. When he got too loud

	She wore a red dress of exquisite formidability. The fabric, exposing her shoulders; from the waist down, the dress loosened and draped to where it was cut just below the knee: revealing a red ribbon, equal in shade to that of the dress, tied securely around her right ankle. The dress acted as a bright contrast to the seemingly monochrome topography of the Lexington Avenue subway station on 59th Street. The white-tiled walls were now withered and coated in miscellaneous filth and graffiti art. The station's accepted commoners and vagrants, alike, all flooded it's floors and weaved through parallel columns spanning the length of the platform. Public benches were offered for the weary; mutters of impatience among the waiting could be heard under the flicker of fluorescent light. This was indeed, a beautifully tragic representation of social conformity. 
	She was 36 years of age as of June, with light blush accents. She had always possessed a pale complexion ever since she could remember. As a result, she had often been mistakenly labeled with ailments and profiled by her former peers. Her skin also offered an ideal canvas for the red of her dress and the dark indentations of the bruises she bore.Though most were concealed, one could barley be seen emerging from the seam of her dress on her upper back; she was used to bruises. Her lips were red: again, similar to the red of the dress. Her eyes were bright blue, emphasized by a minimal application of eye liner. Very little cosmetics were used. She possessed a naturally youthful face: one which did not accurately reflect her age. Cosmetics were rarely applicable. Her long, dark hair was pinned in an upsweeping French twist with the graceful decent of frayed strands that intertwined on each side. This was a suitable frame for her aesthetic facial features and a fitting style for the formality of her appearance.
	She descended the stairs of the subway station and stepped onto the lowest level of the underground platform. The station was moderately populated: comprised of a cluster of age groups ranging from elders in suits to small children, the diverted attention of those around her brought about sporadic glances: not only of her beauty. She carried in her right arm, with her, an infant child wrapped in a blanket and suspended in a woven cradle. The child was abnormally silent, given its age and the current setting. The child was dormant and not a sound was uttered. 
	She walked, medium built, with a freshly shaven face and black hair that was gelled back like some bad 50's nock-off. He wore a tattered, leather jacket over a black crew neck shirt, blue jeans, and some worn sneakers. He was well groomed and sanitary, though his attire reflected some financial difficulty. Upon the bench, and her posture was straight and unrelenting. She remained motionless, diminished the difficulty of its nature. Without parting her lips, this was the first time she had smiled in years. It took the man a considerable time before he became aware of her
	""What is your name?"" she asked. Her voice was seamless and youthful. The man hesitated for a brief moment before clearing his throat.
	""Jake Crow
	""And what is your profession?"" she asked. Her diction was formal with no noticeable accents  and a relatively fast rate of speech. Jake once again hesitated. He found it queer to be abruptly confronted with a series of disjointed personal inquiries. He felt as though he was being interviewed for a job or something. She had a detached, that gave him a sense of uneasiness: never breaking composure.  
	""I'm in the service
	""Are you married?"" 
	""I'm sorry... who are you?"" he finally asked. Her smile widened
	""I was a dancer once, biological effects, their nature, for this anomaly often occurs naturally. Valentines day hearts, carnations, the red illumination of a brothel, red sports cars and the ties that drive them, Mr Crow

1368495533.0,1eab2t,Short story: The Watch,Governator00,2,0,1,"
You know when you find out that you lost the item that you simply cannot lose? That’s me today. I lost a watch that was passed down from my grandfather, but I couldn’t help but feel a little bit of remorse. 


The watch had seen things, that watch has seen things you would never believe.


My grandfather told me about his own father and his experiences with the watch. He said that his father was wearing the watch during the Great Depression


My own father passed the watch down to me a few years back. He told me that he was wearing the watch when he met my mother. They both happened to be driving along and their cars just happened to break down in the same spot. He said it was like one of those things you see on TV where people just fall in love instantly like they were pieces of a puzzle. After they got both of their cars fixed he gave her his number and that was that. 
You know I still haven’t told my story about what the watch has seen. I was wearing the watch when I saw a horrible car crash right in front of me, just held on. The watch was there, it saw the man die right in front of it. After that the watch felt like it wasn’t even there, like something was gone from it. I don’t know, that watch has seen some things you wouldn’t even believe.


  When I finally found the watch sitting inside the couch I thought that it was time to give it to my son. He took it and kind of just threw it on his desk. I tried to explain to him that it was a family treasure and that it was important to keep because it had seen some things he wouldn’t even believe. After that my son asked what it had seen. I told him about the time I was climbing a very tall tower in some big city and that it had seen all the people beneath it, that it would see impossible things that you would never even believe. And you know what? I believed him.

Justice

The prisoner stared impassively into the camera. The bright lights causing beads of sweat to form above his eyes and forcing him to squint, keeping their immediate area comfortably cool. The camera trained on them remained a respectful distance away, and no harsh lights illuminated their somber countenances.

All three judges stared at the camera showing no emotion, effectively placing every citizen of earth in the courtroom as the Chief Judge began to speak in a deep, resonant, clear voice.

“The evidence against you has been examined. This tribunal finds you guilty of the charges against you by a unanimous vote. Have you anything you would like to add before we pass sentence?”

The camera changed back to the prisoner. The lights brightens around him and the heat rises perceptibly, outside the viewing range of the camera which has a tight zoom on his face. “I am guilty of no crime,” the prisoner spoke in a low voice full of palpable weariness and resignation.

“You are guilty of the most heinous of crimes

“But I have done nothing wrong, staining a dark collar of moisture around his neck.

“Silence!” the Chief Judge hissed. “The record will show that the prisoner is unrepentant. This Court finds that the prisoner willfully, and, perhaps most tragically, that he fails to see the enormity of his crime.” The Chief Justice faltered slightly, delivering the final words of the Courts sentence with a slight tremor in his voice. After stopping a moment to compose himself as his learned colleagues looked on impassively, he continued. “It is, therefore

Upon hearing the Judge’s words the prisoner’s eyes opened wider, and the opportunity to be different from everyone else? The joy in these words nearly made him faint with relief and unbridled joy, allowing him for the first time in his life the possibility of hope as tears welled in his eyes. He found he could not speak, could not express even the simple words “thank you” to the Court. It was as though he were emerging from a life-long nightmare, as if . . .

“The prisoner’s IP address,” the Judge continued as the prisoner’s tears flowed freely. His existence shall be forever stricken from the Collective Consciousness lest it germinate there and once again grow sedition in our midst.” The prisoner wept openly now while smiling broadly. “The death sentence for this most heinous of crimes is hereby commuted so that the prisoner may be allowed the individuality he craved for the rest of his natural life, devoid of the comfort of humanity or the distracting influences of life.”

The Chief Judge then paused and took a deep breath. “It is further ordered by this Court that the prisoner shall have his eyes, hear, taste, or speak with any other human being for the rest of his natural life. thereafter, he is to be remanded to a hospital where he shall be restrained to a bed and tended to by robotic life support aids. The sentence of this Court shall be carried out immediately and shall be witnessed by all Citizens of Earth as partial reparation for this most heinous of crimes against humanity.”

The prisoner’s screams lasted only a few moments as an anesthetic was administered and the cameras were re-arranged in preparation for justice to be carried out.

3 years later, but he always said he was too busy. The thought of having a child now wasn’t so farfetched though. He would raise him right. Teach him how to act in public and talk to girls. They would start their own father-son business. Max would teach him everything he knew about the business world and they would be happy. But, women like wealthy men. He knew it wouldn’t happen. Who would want to have a baby with a 40-year old living in a 1 bedroom apartment?


Max spent most of his time at the casino. Gambling is illegal in Illinois, the ringing bells, the dull murmur of small talk, the clanking of chips, it all distracted him of what was going on inside his head. The waitresses knew him by name and the regulars were the closest things he had to friends. He really liked playing poker, not so much the game, but the banter. Shooting shit with the other players, winning hands it was all fun. Max always played Texas Hold’em and on this specific night he was on a hot streak.


Steve played with Max a lot


“Damn Max
“Yah, he had almost quadrupled his money since he got there and was feeling great.


“Can I get you boys a drink?” A tall blond waitress snuck up behind Max put her hand on his shoulder and smiled.


“You sure can Shirley
“You’re too good to me honey!” Shirley eyed his tall stacks of chips. “Doing well


Max blushed


“Just wait


“Looking forward to it darling!” She put her hand on Steve’s shoulder. “What about you


“Another beer!” slurred Steve
“Coming right up! Good luck


Max had folded the past few hands
Max knocked on the table, and the 9 of hearts came up. Max was ecstatic, a three pair already and none of the cards on the board could challenge his hand.


There were four people playing


The dealer put down the king of hearts right in front of Max. Max brushed his long bangs out of his eyes to get a better look. The king’s hair touched his shoulders and connected to a thick curly beard. He was holding a knife that seemed to disappear behind his head.


“I’m all in!” Steve screamed so loud that the whole casino seemed to stop. Max turned to look at Steve


“I call


“Flush!” Steve turned over a 2 and 3 of hearts. The hearts on the cards were as red as his face. Max had lost and had no money left. He looked down then got up from the table and started to walk away.

“Hey Max! Lady luck sure is a bitch


He sat down at the closest slot and put a quarter in,000 dollar jack pot.


“I won! Oh my god I won! Holy shit


“Congratulations
“You lucky son of a gun! Maybe


“How about tomorrow night I buy you drink?”  Max asked with a grin.


“Oh sorry


Steve put Max in a headlock. “Yeah right

Steve let go of Max’s head. “Ain’t that right Max?”


Max put his arm around Steve’s shoulder. “Damn straight bud

TALL BLACK LEGS
(( ↮ ))

An indirectly lit, dark place looks morose and murky, with its concrete supporting beams and bleak corners. A constant and distant echoing of water is only present, more like a soothing white noise. The floor is covered in dirty, muddy water. In the middle of the room it flows with a seemingly determined speed and course towards the invisible longer end, into the black. It might be some kind of an old sewage system. The walls are covered with grey slime and dirt. Irregularly placed pipes gaping on the sides. Like the broken rib-cage of a slaughtered animal.

The light comes from a somewhat circular shaped opening on the ragged ceiling – the work of a grenade – beams of a reflector come closer, black oddity with legs and arms. From the middle of it comes the bright light, instantly seeking left and right, sweeping across the area even before it reaches the ground. It’s big, tall and black, heavy looking but non-metallic. It extends it legs, so it reaches ground sooner, the cables pop off with a tinny sound. The reflector stops sweeping

A couple of hundred meters to the end, very little girl, in very dirty nondescript clothes hides behind a concrete beam. Crouching close to the black water – more like mud – trying to remain calm, breathing through her nose. Eyes and mouth shut tight. Concentrating on the white noise of the sewage waters. Breathing regularly, she doesn't seem to be concerned by anything. Her face is peaceful and calm. The opposite of someone who is being hunted.

A very long 137 seconds pass when the dark, very soothing gentle female voice towards the darkness. Without a rush, audibly.

**“Don’t be afraid. I’m here to help you...  Hadiya Nozwe...”**

**“Don’t be afraid, like a mother.
**“I worry about you... Hadiya
“Where are you
**“Everything will be alright
The gentle
**“I came here just for you my love
**“Don’t be afraid. Don’t be afraid... Hadiya.”** The little girl with panic in her eyes starts to slowly crawl in the stinky water
**“I’m here to help
**“Don’t be afraid
**“Where are you
**“Are you there?”** Sounds much closer.

Some strange noises are coming from the wall she is headed for, adult men dressed in dirty brown robes and faces covered with masks climb from a small opening. The first sees the little girl and waves to her, she starts to crawl faster. The two other men stand in nervous stance clenching metal tubes with triggers on their end, while the first also starts to crawl in the water towards the little girl. The big dark figure stops, erects to two legs with a grotesquely curved back. From the arms silently rotating barrels slide out. It’s listening. Seconds pass in silence. Then it bolts forward fast, the water loudly splashing around its feet, thumping heavily. It turns left where the frightened little girl starts to run towards a man standing up from the water who is blinded by the light, the second ones right limbs and face rips off, but the big dark figure fires a rapid round of bullets ripping his legs and torso apart. His flesh and blood tainting the little girl’s already soiled clothes. With its right arm extending
Then it breaks her legs with one swift motion
**“Don’t be afraid... Hadiya. You are safe now. We are going home.”** Said it with gentle words and a calming voice. Starting with big leaps backwards to the opening in the ceiling.
Only the white noise of the flushing waters remain
