Control.Monad, Data.Ord, Data.Function, Data.Maybe, Data.List, Control.Arrow, Control.Applicative

**Future work:** A proper interactive tutorial, had other people test it, and written the interactive tutorial. I wouldn't want a simple bug to give people a bad vibe about Haskell, it has to be solid.

**JSONRPC interface**:
It uses a JSONRPC service which provides the mueval evaluator

It just supports GET at the moment, similar to how Google Maps API works. Try Haskell uses this generic service.

**So

I remembered how QuickSort is solved in the Haskell FAQ

    someList = [1,4,5,6,7]
    lastElem (xs:p) = p
    main = do
        lastElem someList

The error message is cryptic enough (""Couldn't match expected type `IO t0' with actual type `[t1]'"")

When I realize that the good old ""Hello World!"" isn't being introduced in LYAH until chapter 9 (of 14)

The above code obviously didn't work


**Over to ""Problem 2: Find the last but one element of a list."". I try the following code:**

    Prelude&gt; list
    [2,6,7,8]
    Prelude&gt; let secondLast list = list !! length list - 2
    Prelude&gt; secondLast list
        *** Exception: Prelude.(!!): index too large

I verify that the !! operator works as I expect

Solution: let secondLast list = list !! (length list - 2)
 

**Next ""Problem 3: Find the K'th element of a list. The first element in the list is number 1.""**

Apparently

Otherwise easy
 

**""Problem 4: Find the number of elements of a list.""
""Problem 5: Reverse a list.""**

Skipping because I know of built in functions...
 

**""Problem 6: Find out whether a list is a palindrome. A palindrome can be read forward or backward; e.g. (x a m a x).""**

Uh.. definitely harder. Went to look up if statements and something sort of equal to for-each

Solution: let isPalindrome list = list == reverse list
 

**Then theres ""Problem 7: Flatten a nested list structure.""**

At this point

**""Problem 1: Find the last element of a list.""**

Uh.. it's hard to say what's off limits. I'd say the !! operator is good

    myLast [x] = x
    myLast (_:xs) = myLast xs

Uh... Functional programming is hard

Another solution:

    myLast' = foldr1 (const id)

I end up reading about Fold (http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Fold (dead link to identity element in section 2 btw)) and can feel my mind bend when trying to make sense of the definitions of foldr and foldl. No mention of foldr1 though. And there are two stackoverflow questions for const and id respectively which asks what's the point of them.

Anyway

A short reflection on what went right and wrong seems warranted.

Things that went well:

* Initially Waldo.BrowserCap.mergeBE was a mess of fairly imperative code. Due to many errors in the dataset it was iteratively cleaned up until it became the current functional implementation. This implementation is far more resilient
* Testing via Waldo.LoadTest. Early on we launched a small script that recorded the requests waldo would receive. Our testing merely was to replay these
* Using an embedded domain specific language to encode the stories. The stories came together at the very end and the eDSL made encoding them fairly fast and easy. Even an experienced occasional programmer was able to quickly make changes and additions. I believe that without this level of abstraction that would not have been possible and I do not believe that directly encoding it would have actually saved time. The eDSL is still far from optimal though. The Waldo.A1 module
* Performance of the Haskell code was very good in both terms of throughput and latency. No extensive tuning was required.
* chromakode doing the front end side. He’s amazing and reddit should give him back.

This that went wrong:

* There are very few comments - even where they would be fairly important. Time for typing was time lost in this project sadly. Not only comments suffered for this. 
* Waldo.BrowserCap uses a rather poor matcher. This requires that we try every possible browser separately and with crafted inputs some matchers can be sent down the garden path. For all the complexity of the API of the Haskell regex libraries, the timeline of this project did not allow much time for optimization and as such the simplest solution was used and a large LRU cache was placed in front of it.
* Possibly the eDSL should select the panel sizes also. A knapsack sizer may be a poor choice even in the current form and is pluggable. Time disallowed playing with other solutions.

Future plans:

* Split out Waldo.BrowserCap as it’s own module. This really isn’t something that is conceptually part of waldo and it would make sense to use it elsewhere.
* Instead of integrating the server

Many parts of xkcd are implemented with Haskell. A short list includes:

* dynamic.xkcd.com (though it is unloved and in need of a rewrite
* Umwelt
* pbfcomics.com which we host and somewhat maintain. Based on WAI
* holistic.xkcd.com a quick joke site using WAI, and for spam checking http-conduit.
* Tools for interacting with our hosting provider [voxel.net](http://voxel.net/) (downloads logs
* Some business admin tools.
* Two new sites that haven’t been released yet. One of which is written using [Hakyll](http://i.imgur.com/ACWKO.gif).

Haskell is used so much over here because of its safety and low surprise factor. The community is made up primarily of contributors who tend to care about the details of their respective problem domain and craft APIs to match. While libraries can be scarce the ones that are available are crafted with an attention to detail often lacking in other languages.

We have a decent amount of code, and when we come back to it after a long absence we need to not have to remember that something in a far flung file interacts with it - there must be a clear way to determine the exact behavior. Pure functional programming provides us with very strong guarantees about isolation between the different parts of our code base, while strong types give us assurances about behavior and let us lean on the assumption that in Haskell, “if it compiles, it is probably (still) correct.”

  &gt;         where prefixes = strings ""fif six seven eigh nine""
  &gt;     ten3 = ten2 + ten1 * string ""hundred"" * (one + ten2)
  &gt;     ten6 = ten3 + ten3 * string ""thousand"" * (one + ten3)
  &gt;     ten9 = ten6 + ten3 * string ""million"" * (one + ten6)

  It also demonstrates how the straightforward approach (just generating the strings) is too slow for the author's patience.

  &gt;     *WordNumbers1&gt; length (concat (ten9 :: [String]))
  &gt;     Interrupted.

2. [The second post](http://conway.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/wiki/blog/posts/WordNumbers2/) introduces the concept of generating the solution directly from the problem statement

  &gt; Now we can quickly count the total number of characters in the English words from one to a billion.
  &gt;
  &gt;     *WordNumbers2&gt; ten9 :: Deriv Count Volume
  &gt;     Deriv 999999999 70305000000
  &gt;
  &gt; For a sanity check
  &gt;
  &gt;     *WordNumbers2&gt; ten6 :: Deriv Count Volume
  &gt;     Deriv 999999 44872000
  &gt;
  &gt; … which agrees with our previous result

3. [The third post, where the words are concatenated in numeric order (rather than sorted into alphabetic order). The author uses a binary tree monoid to maintain the order of the generated words.

  &gt; The binary search is now straightforward to write.
  &gt; We can now quickly solve the problem…
  &gt;
  &gt;     *WordNumbers3&gt; answer 51000000000
  &gt;     (""sevenhundredthirtytwomil""
  &gt;
  &gt; …and check a few small values to be sure there are no off by one errors.
  &gt;
  &gt;     *WordNumbers3&gt; answer 3
  &gt;     (""on""
  &gt;     *WordNumbers3&gt; answer 4
  &gt;     (""""


4. [The final post, returns to the original problem statement and uses a trie to implement radix sort of the words.

  &gt; Using this binary search
  &gt;
  &gt;     *WordNumbers4&gt; search (&gt;= Nat 1) ten9
  &gt;     (""eight""
  &gt;
  &gt; … as easily as the last string or the middle one.
  &gt;
  &gt;     *WordNumbers4&gt; search (&gt;= Nat 999999999) ten9
  &gt;     (""twothousandtwohundredtwo""
  &gt;     *WordNumbers4&gt; search (&gt;= Nat 500000000) ten9
  &gt;     (""onehundredonemilliononehundredseventhousandtwohundredtwentyone""
  &gt;
  &gt; In these searches
  &gt;
  &gt;     *WordNumbers4&gt; search ((&gt;= 51000000000) . volume) ten9
  &gt;     (""sixhundredseventysixmillionsevenhundredfortysixthousandfivehundredseventyfive""

  Now that the original problem has been solved
  another derivative-based monoid:



  &gt;     answer | target == volume m = (string
  &gt;            | otherwise = error ""The target letter does not end a string""
  &gt;       where target = 51000000000
  &gt;             Numbered grammar = one + ten9
  &gt;             (string
  &gt;             stop m = volume m &gt;= target
  &gt;             volume (Deriv _ (Wrap (Nat n)
  &gt;             mass   (Deriv _ (_
  &gt;
  &gt; The answer to the puzzle is an ordered pair.
  &gt;
  &gt;     *WordNumbers4&gt; answer
  &gt;     (""sixhundredseventysixmillionsevenhundredfortysixthousandfivehundredseventyfive""

It has also been pointed out there that it might be wise to start a new thread with the reaction I posted there

Let me start by thanking everyone for spelling my name correctly. Usually it is causing great problems. Let me try to summarize my opinion and give some background information.

1) We just had elections in the Netherlands and being a member of a political party I was bombarded by messages like: if every member finds another member we have twice as many members

2) The speaker wanted to double the number of Haskell programmers in a year

3) As a community

4) I my FP classes I notice that the course is taken by many math students too

5) My conclusion is that if we want to get a more balanced representation Haskell offers a great opportunities.

6) Now the crucial remark, meaning: - I would feel less weird in more a balanced audience (i.e. going to a more balanced meeting would be more attractive to me) - I think women would feel less weird in a more balanced audience (i.e. would be more attracted to a more balanced audience)

7) Let me explain my opinion about the latter observation. I do not think that there is any reason why there should not be more women in CS. I have been lecturing for many years in Bolivia, they were good at it, and I see no way why this should not be the case in at least the place where I am coming from. But, I also see that I have a female colleague, and she is attracting significantly more female master and Ph.D. students than to be expected based on the composition of our student population. Apparently there is something attractive in doing a project with her, most likely because women feel less isolated there. So I firmly believe that we have a chicken/egg problem: we attract few women because we attract few women. I think the FP/Haskell community and the link to math, where they do not have this problem

This is an exercise that highlights some problems with using monadic IO in a simple practical context.  The problem is a simplification of one I routinely encounter at a large scale in the course of the work I do.

My own ""solutions"" are:

- use unsafePerformIO
- use unsafeInterleaveIO
- use another language.

Every once in a while I like to ask Haskellers if they have a better idea.

**The Problem**

There is a standard Unix utility called ""du"", and do a fold to get the total.

The unfold portion of this is the Unix ""find"" command

This problem is unlike the typical Haskell lazy I/O examples in that the I/O is nested:  you have to perform the previous step's I/O to get the data you need to define the next step's I/O.  While it's unlike typical examples, and which chunk you need to get is quite likely to depend on what you found in the previous chunk.

As far as I can tell

1. be space-efficient (i.e.
1. be functional in the Haskellish sense (i.e.
1. use data structures that can be operated on with standard libraries that ship with Haskell or are in common usage

Haskell true believers tell me to give up on (3), Perl, Python, bash, Java, Clojure, or Scheme;  the only reason to do it in Haskell is to make it short and elegant

**Iteratees**

I've read the paper.  It didn't appear to resolve problem (3).  If I'm wrong

    foo (Con1 ...) = ...
    foo (Con2 ...) = ...
    foo (Con3 ...) = ...
    ...

My trick is to add this at the beginning:

    foo arg | trace (show arg) False = undefined

Now every time *foo* is called this first pattern is checked (and always fails) and the trace will give me the argument that foo was called with

I'm really interested in the concept of functional reactive programming, [Main.hs from the breakout example using reactive-banana](https://github.com/bernstein/breakout/blob/master/src/Main.hs) is just full of cryptic operators like &lt;&gt;, &lt;$&gt;, &lt;$, #, and &lt;*&gt; (among others), and functions strung together in what to me looks like totally unintuitive ways.

Now

* Yes, and I was easily able to look up Semigroup to figure out that &lt;&gt; is a group operation. I don't expect to be able to understand reactive-banana code without reading documentation, but at least in an OOP context I would have descriptive function names to guide me.

* I also know that a significant part of Haskell's expressivity comes from the programmer understanding more abstract

* I realize this particular package is not necessary exemplary of good coding or commenting style; however I found the same thing looking at the Frag source (which uses Yampa for FRP).

Given all of that though, and future me is not going to remember the meaning of all these seemingly arbitrary sequences of special characters. Future me is not going to be able to make sense of something like this (again from the breakout code):

    paddleHit :: Behavior t P2 -&gt; Behavior t P2 -&gt; Event t ()
              -&gt; Event t (Velocity -&gt; Velocity)
    paddleHit paddlePos ballPos frame =
      let c = colliding paddlePic &lt;$&gt; paddlePos &lt;*&gt; pure ballPic &lt;*&gt; ballPos
          response v@(unr2 -&gt; (vx
      in response &lt;$ whenE c frame

Good comments will remind me *what* that does

I'm not sure if this is a problem with me, or with Haskell itself; probably a little bit of everything. The bottom line is I'm just really discouraged right now about the practicality of Haskell+FRP for such a project, and I was wondering what more experienced users have to say on the subject.",,False,,t5_2qh36,,http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/19v4l1/i_cant_shake_the_impression_that_frp_code_is_just/

First of all, and pull requests. Special thanks to Michael Snoyman for providing a whole new Yesod implementation that's much faster. It's been a great learning experience for me, and I hope that if nothing else I can use this post to document some of the things I've learned in hopes that others find it useful.

[Round 3 benchmarking results](http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r3)

The short of it is that Yesod has seen some good improvements, but without proper profiling I can't find out what the cause is. [A new parallel IO manager](http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2013-February/000414.html) was recently merged into GHC that scales better with the number of available cores, so a possible explanation is the current parallel IO manager is simply failing to scale up to 8 cores.

One of the first batches of improvements made was to the RTS options. I was really excited about these changes because on my test box I saw reqs/sec increase by a factor of 4-5, but without access to the hardware used for the tests my capacity is very limited in that regard. I'd love it if someone could give me some good heuristics for what `-A` should be set to, though, since I have no idea.

Next up were changing the libraries used. `json` was replaced with `aeson`, but I've since come up with a good rule of thumb: if you're trying to decide between two or more libraries for a given task and Bryan O'Sullivan is listed as the author of one, use that one.

Unfortunately, causing lock contention to do terrible things to throughput. I'm hoping to get some time to deal with that this week, although I'm not expecting much of an improvement over the current version.

Probably the most interesting change is found in Mr. Snoyman's Yesod build. Specifically

So that's the current status of the Yesod and Snap benchmarks. The guys behind the benchmarks will continue running them so long as they continue getting pull requests, do any configuration fix-ups, and issue pull requests on your behalf.

I'm writing my first greenfield project in Haskell having been tinkering for quite a while. It's become apparent that I don't have a good intuition for ""haskell in the large"" (and this is a feeling I've seen expressed before by people new to the language). If it's OK I'd like to ask some general big picture haskell application design questions here in the hope that they will help myself and others.

Here's what I'm writing for some context:

I want to write a client library for my excellent online small business accounting package

* Oauth2 library and http client. I've gone for hoauth2 and http-streams. I'm not set in stone here; any pointers?

* A library to manage a ~/.hfreeagent config file. The config file will need to manage and store the oauth credentials (id, the location of ledger files, and token management (oauth2 tokens need to be periodically refreshed). ConfigFile or bos' library look like good options here.

* A rest client which marshals json objects to haskell and thence to however hledger represents things. Aeson looks good for this one.

So far so good!

So the questions then:

* What should my monad stack look like? The presence of the config suggests a ReaderT somewhere. But I'll also need to write to the config file when I refresh a token

* Any pointers on structuring the library (directory structure

* Is there anything that could generate my types from json for me? Something like F#'s type providers

* How would you model the workflow of looking up the token

I think that will do for now. The library will be open source https://github.com/perurbis/hfreeagent

----

The rules here are pretty simple.  The radix tree syntax is signalled by an empty `import` line

* a prefix, or
* an import

  * module namespace: one of

     * `qualified`
     * `as X`
     * nothing (inject into module namespace)

  * a list of module contents to import: one of

     * `(...)`
     * nothing (take all contents)

----

Conclusions: this reduces the number of non-whitespace characters in this example from 902 to 543: a 42% reduction.

----

Edit 1: and if this is useful

Edit 2: the quick and dirty solution is a preprocessor.  [GHC lets you preprocess](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.4.1/html/users_guide/flag-reference.html) with the `-pgmF &lt;cmd&gt;` flag.  Any takers?

Edit 3: replaced `qualified as X` with simply `as X`.

Hackage 2 info pages live on the cabal wiki: http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/wiki/HackageDB/2.0

Note

The issue tracker is on github (with the cabal repo): https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues?labels=hackage2&amp;state=open

Note, but in darcs: darcs get http://code.haskell.org/hackage-server

If you're interested in our package repositories and architecture

Also, the new architecture is much more modular. Helping out with issues, core features, patches etc at the moment will get you in good familiarity with the codebase, so tossing on social plugins, etc. in the future will be a more straightforward task.

Other platforms have formed teams with the goal to provide easy

 * [Debian/Haskell](http://wiki.debian.org/Haskell)
 * [Arch/Haskell](http://archhaskell.wordpress.com/)
 * Fedora/Haskell
 * Gentoo/Haskell

A small dedicated team of 3 or so should be able to ensure the Mac is up to date. This would benefit thousands. All it needs is a bit of leadership

This is open source

 * documentation for the current resources (MacPorts
 * a discussion page where people can add technical issues they're concerned about

[Looking at the diff of the raw data](http://alioth.debian.org/scm/viewvc.php/shootout/website/websites/u64q/data/ndata.csv?root=shootout&amp;r1=1.540&amp;r2=1.541) (see below for the header for that diff) it looks like the [regexdna program fails to compile](http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/program.php?test=regexdna&amp;lang=ghc&amp;id=2#log) due to the lack of `Text.Regex.PCRE.ByteString' and there is a significant performance regression in knucleotide (it seems to be using only one core now).

Haskell](http://tryhaskell.org/). **Please** don't post
this proggit; it's still WIP.

If you've got 10 minutes and you don't mind reviewing it that'd be
really helpful. Newbies very welcome but keep in mind this is **alpha**.

Here's what I've done since last time:

* Fixed some priority bugs (works well in Chrome/Safari now)
* adjusted the sizes of some stuff
* added some links to the Haskell site and Real World Haskell
* added :t and :modules commands
* up/down history (though this is a wee bit buggy
* a cheeky and secret hook-up to the Raphael JavaScript library. See
  the `:t circle` and `mapM_ (\\x -&gt; circle (10*x) (sin x*10+20) 10) [1..10]`.
* an incomplete
  so far): (1) Expressions and types (2) Functions on lists and
  tuples

If you want to write a transcript,result), if that trigger is true then the page is displayed, otherwise it will wait till they get it right. This goes in linear order only.

**Future plans**

* :let is planned
  to Cale and others for this idea) -- basically these two are ""having
  a definitions file per user session on the web server"".

* QuickCheck? Could be used as a teaching aid. E.g ""define a function that
  doubles all the numbers in a list"" -- use QuickCheck in the
  background to determine the accuracy of the implementation
  (actually someone just suggested
  [smallcheck](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/smallcheck)
  sounds good because turnaround time is important) -- this would make
  TryHaskell seem intelligent and possibly freak newbies out. Splendid.

* A more full implementation of Raphael and other libraries.

**EDIT** Extra plans I forgot:

* Get a VPS on Linode.

* Hayoo/Hoogle integrated documentation/lookup.

* Real-time syntax checking (e.g.

* Multiline input?

* Pretty printing output and errors.

* Make expressions clickable a la SLIME.

* How to deal with teaching IO, I don't think. I think it would be easier to use things like readFile, Raphael, downloading RSS feeds, stuff like that. Or maybe IO is just too advanced for a tutorial like this.

For example, and checking out [his blog](http://www.serpentine.com/blog/).

But I did catch [postgresql-simple](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-simple) on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/nw5dn/announcing_postgresqlsimple/) recently....)

&gt; There’s definitely some truth to Haskell’s reputation as a language that’s hard to learn. Fortunately it’s less about Haskell and more about us. As imperative programmers we bring a lot of baggage to Haskell. We expect to mutate variables

To me, functor, category theory, comonad, isomorphism, applicative, existentially quantified type

Is this just me?

Edit: I guess I should have left Monad off the list

Edit 2: Well I had been hoping for a person or two to point out if I was missing something, some I have experienced myself):

* It is unclear whether it is a desirable goal to use a vocabulary other than Math for some/many of these concepts. Maybe it would make Haskell more accessible
* Regardless of whether this is a desirable goal
* 1 letter variable names make sense in several situations: small scope (x:xs), and when there is literally no meaningful label possible.
* Short variable names help you see the structure of a computation. I have noticed this in Pyton/Java
* This community seems ok with forcing the reader to figure out what a, rather than labeling those roles in the computation so the reader doesn't have to figure it out from scratch and then remember the mapping between arbitrary symbols and their semantics. (I generally disagree with this judgement.)
* The term ""intention revealing names"" makes some members of this community think of crazy long names like AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean

Similar things can be done in any language that has monad syntax (Idris, Scala), generators (Python), forks or ~~longjmp and setjmp~~ direct stack access.

Note that this is more like longjmp/setjmp than the usual goto statement. I think.",,t5_2qh36,1375464177.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1jk06q/goto_in_haskell/

[GLFW-b](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/GLFW-b) is Haskell bindings to the C library.

The GLFW C library guys recently released version 3, and we believe it builds on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.

An easy way to see what this is all about is to install [GLFW-b-demo](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/GLFW-b-demo) and run its executable of the same name. You should see the famous gears from glxgears(1) and be able to control rotation with keyboard, and can watch GLFW events firing.
