Here's how it was: three months ago I was a happy man. I had a good job, and otherwise basically everything I needed to provide a comfortable, happy life for myself and the woman I intended to marry someday. We both have your OH SO PATHETIC, OMG HOW COULD YOU STEM DEGREES that  you bitches hate so much and we were both working good, decent jobs and we lived in a nice apartment, basically coming home from work every day to hang out and play video games or have sex or whatever. We were happy is my point.

Then she started reading your shit-slinging subreddit and you bitches taught her to hate men.

It started with her not liking video games any more. We were playing ME3, BTW) and she stopped wanting to play because EDI doesn't wear clothes...? Whatever, you feminazi cunts, she's a fucking robot, of course she doesn't wear clothes. She was made to inflitrate human society, so of course she's sexually attractive. You dumb bitches can't separate logic from real sexism AND YOU CORRUPTED HER WITH YOUR STUPIDITY. SHE WAS INNOCENT OF YOUR HATRED UNTIL YOU LIED ABOUT WHAT REAL WOMEN ACT LIKE, YOU FUCKING FEMINAZI BRABURNERS.

But it gets worse, but she starts bitching at every movie or TV show we watch, whining about how women wear sexy clothing (because only ugly women are real, hurr) or whatever, and starts doing nothing but reading your shit subreddit and whatever hateful anti-man books she can get her hands on. We were talking abotu having a kid someday, and suddenly she won't even hear about it because she's too good to someday give up her job to HAVE A CHILD LIKE A NORMAL FUCKING WOMAN.

First, this tendency to anthropomorphize reddit as a single entity. The problem with that is that it isn't. Some men like women with make up. Some men like women without make up. Some women like outspoken and confident men. Some women like men who are shy and sweet. Some men like women who will quietly obey them. Some men like women who will be their equal and partner. This is the nature of the game. There are posts that call Obama a saint and posts that call him the Antichrist. How can he be both?

Secondly, but I'm assumed to be a muscle bound  idiot if I get too big. I'm never supposed to cry, but I can't be emotionally unavailable.

1340602535.0,vk5e3,[EFFORT] Shit. Shit everywhere. ,daylight0348,1446,548,686,"Hi SRS. I have no doubt that this will be deleted rather promptly. I don't especially care.

The long-story-short of this message is that the biggest shitlords here are you. Yes, I'll come across a group of people who manage to redefine my view of what constitutes the 'worst of the worst' on the internet. I'm posting here not because I want to make you angry, nor because I want to convince you of the error of your ways. In fact, in true SRS fashion, I am here to rant; I'm here to rant like an impotent and impetuous child because I am ashamed that you--under the guise feminism, an admirable movement that I consider myself a part of--have collectively managed to outdo all the religious fundamentalists and all the racist bigots with your unapologetic intolerance and childishness.

I suppose that a lot of my frustration stems from confusion. Why the fuck do you guys even exist? You clearly all think that Reddit is a terrible place. So why do you stick around? All you guys do is sit around and make each other angry. You literally have no mind toward improving Reddit--in fact, actively seek out things that make you angry, and then post them to a forum to pile on the hate.

And if you're reciting to yourself that tired old excuse that this place is therapeutic, because I've fucking seen regulars talking about how the need a break from this place. Somehow, it never even occurs to them that that is a major indication that this place is unhealthy.

Unhealthy is an understatement. This place is a cesspool of unnecessary anger and self-pity. 

Tell me: has it ever crossed your mind that this place does more harm than good? Let's forget the fact that you stand on shaky ground when it comes to the psychological health of your actual members. How does SRS look from the outside?

I'll tell you exactly how it looks: insane. Completely

I am not exaggerating. I'm not using ""insane"" to mean poorly-thought-out or stupid or disagreeable. I am literally telling you that to an outsider, the lazy satire, the way every goddamn thread plays out in exactly (once again, I am not being hyperbolic; I truly mean exactly) the same way--and my god, the sheer childishness of it all! Do you think that you're shocking someone with your phallic emoticons? Do you think that you're actually making fun of someone with the art in your sidebar, or the bad spelling and grammar? Sometimes, things happen on such a scale that only understatement can properly convey their enormity. And this is such a case, as a community

Don't get me wrong--it's your right to act this way. It's not as though there aren't a thousand other subreddits that are at least close to as immature as yours (though I hesitate to agree that there are any that actually surpass your impressive immaturity). But it never seems to cross anyone's mind that this is bad for the image of feminism on the internet. What is someone supposed to think when they come here? Sure

Don't tell me that reasonable people will embrace your message, indeed, the people who receive them without throwing a preachy tantrum--is insufferable. Yes, sometimes these jokes are off-color, but that means nothing in today's society. Do you stand up in protest at the offensive jokes told during a roast? Then why the fuck would you do the same here? What you don't understand is that the basis for the overwhelming majority of these ""racist"" or ""sexist"" jokes is not discrimination but solidarity. The internet promotes unity, and this unity makes people comfortable with this type of joke. All you do is disrupt this unity and make people uncomfortable. You don't point out the elephant in the room; you fucking construct it out of paper straws and fight tooth and nail to stop anyone from knocking it down. And that drives reasonable people away from you and away from your cause. 

And the worst part is simply how spiteful you all are. People who are at worst slightly ignorant (but far more likely simply making a harmless joke) become the target of absolutely ludicrous quantities of hatred here. And the hatred isn't limited to their ""misogyny""--no, resort to personal and totally uncalled-for insults.

Never in my life have I called a woman a cunt. It is not something that I will be comfortable with; but I'll be damned if I wasn't tempted to apply that term to you, but have no problem with constantly shouting about how Reddit is filled with sexually inept neckbeards. Fucking wake up, SRS. Only a man can be a neckbeard, and believe it or not, that's a fucking gendered slur. Didn't seem so bad using it all the time, did it? Well that's how the whole world feels when it uses the word 'bitch' to describe women like you. 

I was wrong earlier; this is mostly a rant, and perhaps that single mod won't even read it all the way through. But that doesn't matter to me, because I am a feminist, and I do not like the idea of people like you lumping yourselves together with people like me on a community as large as Reddit. 

So I'll post this more than once. I won't inundate you with spam, maybe every couple months. My hope is that at some point, a mod will read it all the way through before deleting it. If that happens, I don't know what will follow--but I wish that maybe something here will strike a chord with them, and they could change something.

1353978015.0,13ufh3,[Effort] What makes Gina a Good Girl?,LaTeX_fetish,1175,307,305,"Meet [Greg](http://www.quickmeme.com/Good-Guy-Greg/). Greg is an Advice Animal (loosely speaking

Logically Gina's main purpose would be to demonstrate situations where a girl rather than a guy did something nice, as I'll demonstrate.

After seeing what I thought was the hundredth Gina who cooked breakfast after giving a guy a blowjob while he smoked a joint and played Nintendo, I categorized each one as one or more of the following:

**Sexualized or objectified:** Gina is presented as a sex object, [she's still a target for lust](http://i.qkme.me/3pkmv7.jpg)


**Performs oral sex:** [This is pretty straightforward](http://i.qkme.me/3p2qip.jpg). There's the occasional lesbian submission


**Has anal sex:** [Again


**References to her period:** A noticeable minority of GGG submissions contained references to her period. Typically these involved [her providing sexual pleasure](http://i.qkme.me/3pkfcz.jpg) or sometimes [disappearing altogether](http://i.qkme.me/3pknry.jpg) because hey


**Sexually gratifies someone:** Gina gratifies someone sexually. [Maybe she doesn't want to](http://i.qkme.me/3qziz7.jpg) or [maybe she suggests it herself](http://i.qkme.me/3opy0e.jpg). Or perhaps [she acts as a masturbation aid](http://i.qkme.me/3pl0xu.jpg). Regardless


**Making sure she (or someone else) is sexually available:** Sometimes Gina doesn't want to have sex


**Policing her dating and sex life:** First and foremost, by the way. Oh, and [she's not being devious about it](http://i.qkme.me/3p1rpe.jpg). She also [doesn't cheat](http://i.qkme.me/3p2ptz.jpg) the second her significant other is away (nb: after reading all of these memes, I can only assume this is a natural female impulse).


**Uses approved media or approves of it:**. Gina [shares your taste in video games](http://i.qkme.me/3prs99.jpg). She [also won't submit you to her interests](http://i.qkme.me/3pj5pq.jpg).


**Takes part in or approves of your lifestyle:** This one is more oriented to weed and booze. She [brings her own weed](http://i.qkme.me/3qplk7.jpg)


**She isn't a stereotype:** Unlike all those other girls, and she [leaves the toilet seat up](http://i.qkme.me/3qhcqp.jpg). (Seriously you have no idea how often those last two came up. Goddamnit reddit get better jokes.)


**She doesn't rock the boat:** Did Gina break up with her boyfriend? It's hard to tell because [she's not talking about it on Facebook](http://i.qkme.me/3osnrv.jpg). Her lunch is [also not on Facebook](http://i.qkme.me/3qizdn.jpg). Nor is [her latest hairstyle](http://i.qkme.me/3qctem.jpg). [She certainly won't](http://i.qkme.me/3qsdbc.jpg) [self-identify as a nerd](http://i.qkme.me/3qoc54.jpg). And she definitely won't commit the cardinal sin of [identifying herself as a woman](http://i.qkme.me/3opevy.jpg).


**Provides food or drink:** And of course


**Other horrible shit:** Some submissions make [casual use of slurs](http://i.qkme.me/3qe9jj.jpg). [Sometimes submissions are just terrible (TW).](http://i.qkme.me/3p9er6.jpg)

So what can we glean from all this? If someone wants to be a Good Girl, unless they play into your desires, like when she cooks for you. A Good Girl plays your video games and watches your movies, and she'll bring you food and drinks and drugs, but a Good Girl won't talk about any of those things, because she is a Good Girl. And a Good Girl keeps quiet and doesn't rock the boat.

I get it: you're all butthurt, so when your lip quivers at someone making the slightest joke about women, or your nose ruffles when you hear someone slamming obese people, no one knows how butthurt you really are. Except me. I know because I'm not fucking stupid and have been around shits like you all my life.

I consider myself a progressive,"" doesn't mean that you make a good point. You guys are so caught up in each other, you don't even debate the others because you have the larger audience, and therefore know you'll ""win.""

I could write a lot more, 12-13% bodyfat, and I can bench almost 315 pounds. So no, I have no problem getting girls. And no, I don't objectify or oversexualize them just because I make jokes about their womanness or comment on their attractiveness in picture threads. I'm just being a human instead of trying to fight it to seem morally superior. The first thing we see in anyone is appearance, can you blame us for judging someone like that when it's the only thing we know about them?

Tl;dr: You guys aren't helping yourselves. You're only further convincing each other and driving everyone else away.

Edit: So since your own admins can't stop me from posting (banning me doesn't mean I can no longer edit this message)

I never said whites or men were oppressed. I never fucking said that and yet, which is exactly why I didn't say it. All you guys can do is use strawmen arguments and attack in swarms, because you might actually feel like you're not right about everything otherwise. Why not take on people by yourself? Why do you have to recruit your whole fucking battalion like it's too much on your own? It's just... amazing that you guys can't realize that everyone else thinks you guys are wrong.

Edit 2: I only told you guys how much I can bench so you couldn't call me some pathetic fat idiot. I am very much physically equipped, so I just had to get that out. It's a double-edged sword; I'll get criticized either way.

Edit 3: I made a new thread to point out just what happened after the creation of this one

[Link to the original thread

I made a thread on this subreddit recently condemning the actions of Shit Reddit Says and was met with much ridicule. I yielded a number of responses that poked fun at me publicly

I was bombarded with private message after private message of posters continually calling me fat, stupid, with many suggesting I should kill myself. Please know that I meant no ill-will by what I posted on here and only meant the best (at the very least, I think you can all agree that I'm not a harmful person). 

Though many people here seem to actively fight bullying

Reddit.com is a social website that allows its user to share and discuss content such as videos, websites, and so on.

Reddit is massively popular (http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/2-billion-beyond.html)

Reddit is split into subcommunities known as ""subreddits

Unfortunately, rapists, peeping Toms, and sex offenders. 

Last fall

Dozens of subreddits took its place. 

Reddit users, while admins didn't ban sexualized images of children on paper until last February (http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/02/policy-shift-reddit-bans-child-pornography.html), the rule remains unenforced, indicating that they are more interested in shielding themselves from bad press than protecting innocent kids.

A list of ""jailbait"" (child porn) forums that are currently on reddit:

* girlsinschooluniforms
* volleyballgirls
* TeenSex
* realteens
* LatinaJailbait
* MidgetJailbait
* johnnybait
* FirstRight
* Underage
* Jail_bait
* Jailbaits
* NSFW_JAILBAIT_TUBE
* PregnantJailbait
* PhotoPlunder
* FacebookCleavage
* japanese_idols
* AngieVerona


Some of these forums are hidden and invite only which makes it impossible to know how many actually exist.

The owners of reddit know there is active trading of child porn on their forums and refuse to do anything about it. Any reports are deleted and ignored. Further

Included in the Anderson Cooper report was the statement by Reddit General Manager Erik Martin which defends the child pornography remaining on the site: ""We’re a free speech site and the cost of that is there’s offensive stuff on there … Once we start taking down some things we find offensive




The former leader of the child pornography rings

&gt;(4:03:13 PM) hueypriest: want to give you a heads up

&gt;(4:04:00 PM) hueypriest: we're making a policy change regarding jailbait type content. Don't really have a choice.

Reddit also has subreddits which publish images of women's and underage girls' private areas

A list of these forums currently on Reddit include:

* CreepShots
* Upskirt
* Downblouse
* yogapants
* Voyeur

A majority of these images are of girls in high school classroom settings.

Creepshots' FAQ states:
""Creepshots are CANDID. If a person is posing for and/or aware that a picture is being taken, that is what makes a true creepshot worth the effort and that is why this sub-reddit exists.""

One user, and shares them on reddit. http://i.imgur.com/1Hkpt.png

Not only is this all of this disgusting

&gt;Whoever, and knowingly does so under circumstances in which the individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.


Other forums are explicitly devoted to filming sexual assaults and sharing them on reddit as pornography for other users. These include:

* RapingWomen
* RapingTrannies
* StruggleFucking
* AbusePorn
* BeatingTrannies
* BeatingWomen


Sick to your stomach yet? Here's more awful Reddit things:

* A pedophile's confession -http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/mz0au/iama_man_who_at_24_met_a_14_yr_old_girl_and_lost/
* Thousands of rapists being supported by the community -http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/29/rapist-confessions-reddit

&gt;As a team that is trying to grow and become a respectable organization in a growing industry; a team that was created and is ran by professional gamers, as a waiter, you will know how much bigger of a deal it is to have negative feedback and someone telling the manager or writing a letter to the ownership of the restaurant about you being a crappy waiter than to have someone commend you on how great you are doing.

*Yeah it's not like Destiny's fanbase is entirely manchildren or anything. Btw that entire thread is calling people out for being too scared to post the emailed conversations to the sponsors.

It's those people who E-Mail sponsors not people who are actually upset at the events.
This is why the E-Mailing sponsor situation is so dangerous

*yeah nobody saw anything wrong with what he did and everyone just dislikes him for the hell of it.*

[""This shit is so stupid. ROOT was supposed to be the laid back team. But sponsor worship runs the scene these days. A bunch of shithead haters contacted sponsors?

We wont see Destiny on another team, which is fucking sad, because he is a great entertainer. I guess there really is no way to go mainstream without selling out.
And you know the haters were just waiting in the wings, Stephano gets arrested but he's untouchable because he places well at tournaments. Destiny could be making a comeback, but in the midst of all the personal issues Destiny is going through, dealing with all the other fallout from MLG, his team of FRIENDS doesn't even support him through it.

The inability of anyone to grow from mistakes without being punished severely in this space is becoming quite scary. This particular instance already had plenty of its own native punishment without losing your team as well.

**User steelbender0 has repeatedly engaged in criminal behavior. In the past

----------------------------------------------------------------

[User steelbender0's first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/ygyyq/pilled_out_sister_in_law_creepshhhh/) was published a month ago. The pictures show a scantily clad woman fast asleep inside a private residence. According to the post title

These photos violate the ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" clause in most laws regarding candid photography. And

The users of /r/creepshots rewarded steelbender0's immoral

- Users frasier_crane

- Users sanchop69

- Users treytable and FuckAllTheWomen actually tell steelbender0 he should sexually assault this woman the next time she's asleep.

Only two users express any qualms about what happened to this woman. Everyone else is treating her as though she were a buffet table. It is horrifying.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Tragically, etc. are still up.)

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/1XYFL.png)

**Besides once again taking and publishing illegal photographs of this woman

&gt;I don't drug her, I aint killin anyone ya herd???

**The images are apparently from a video steelbender0 made of himself assaulting this woman**:

&gt;That photo came from a 3 minute long video where I had some good fun...Trying to keep the party rolling if you know what I mean and she's down! fo sho! CREEEEP!~ While the girlfriend is away.

Further down:

&gt;I did fuck the shit out of her though if you really must know. Feel free to tell her sister.

Several users express disgust

Steelbender0 is completely unabashed about his crimes. What's truly alarming is that it seems that **he did all of this for the approval of the r/creepshots community**. He states:

&gt;Yall give me the proper votes...I'll get the goodness. Fuck that dumb shit

He promises that he'll post the video of him raping his sister-in-law if he gets enough upvotes (perhaps he was inspired by [this incident](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/zkk52/tweffort_post_i_am_a_consumer_of_prostitution/)):

&gt;I will post the video if this gets what ""I"" consider enough up votes. Come on people damn!

That's right. This man committed evil and illegal acts for imaginary internet points.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Though steelbender0's posts are heinous

- Recently a teacher who took creepshots of his high school students was caught and fired. [It turned out that he was grooming a 16-year-old girl he met through Reddit.](http://www.thecitizen.com/articles/09-28-2012/coweta-teacher-fired-posting-pics-students-creepshots). This man is currently being investigated by Ohio police. 

- Despite rule changes

- [One r/creepshots user recently attempted to obstruct justice](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepshaming/comments/10guj4/obstruction_of_justice_creeplove356_attempts_to/) by warning the target of an ongoing police investigation. The suspect apparently attempted to buy sex from an underage girl.

1346103941.0,yxc2m,[Effortpost] The antifeminist history of r/feminism: past and present,cleos,485,132,73,"Note:

This post is broken down into three parts.

Quick Resources for easy digesting:

The sidebar of /r/feminism reads

&gt; Welcome to the feminism community! This is a space for discussing and promoting awareness of issues related to equality for women.

&gt; Please help us preserve the intent of this space as a place for feminists to work together.

CSS coding has even been used to change ""readers"" and ""users here now"" to ""supporters of equality for women.""

But as nicely as the sidebar can be dressed up to be

About six months ago

Six months later

There has long since been a problem in r/feminism with MRAs, points are dismissed, and peoples' posts are often broken down and dissected with the most asinine arguments by people who are not simply critical of feminism, but are hostile and antagonistic toward it.

Let's be clear about what the problem is: The issue is not that r/feminism isn't some echo-chamber for everybody to agree in. The problem isn't that there's dissent or disagreement. The problem is that a *very large portion* of comments in r/feminism are antagonistic towards feminism or dismissive of threads. Basic principles of feminism aren't simply debated - they're openly rejected by people who think feminism is little more than a joke. The subreddit /r/WhereAreTheFeminists has been documenting instances of antifeminist comments in r/feminism

Imagine what a subreddit like r/Democrats would be if a significant percentage of the users posting in it were Republicans. Imagine what kind of discussion would take place if the majority of the threads began with comments about how the article was mean to Republicans

**Feminists cannot engage in feminist discussion in r/feminism because so much of the discourse is antifeminist in nature.**

This is perhaps the biggest issue with the subreddit, where as many as half the threads on the first page (and almost always, at least 8-9 threads) either had a score of zero or less than zero. 

The moderators have made some efforts to clean up the subreddit, [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/wjhpf/meta_more_than_half_the_threads_on_the_new_page/), [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/x39rw/what_the_hell_is_going_on_here/)) before the moderators dealt with the downvoting problem (solution: remove downvote arrow!)  Some of the worst trolls in the subreddit, after months of trolling and months of complaining about the trolls, were banned, although some remained, and new ones are rolling in. Where MRAs and antifeminists have been excused and forgiven repeatedly, ban threats

**In recent months

r/feminism has 5 moderators


impotent_rage - Recently did not post for a span of three weeks; similar large gaps.

s00ngtype - hasn't posted in a month

Reizu - about four posts in the past month




(Edit as of October 24

wabi-sabi, and no longer shows in the mod listings on the subreddit.

MidnightAria was made a moderator. No announcement was given



That brings us to demmian


First

Although r/feminism was created about three years ago, and asked the site administrators not to give Cliffor the subreddit. The admin gave them both access to the subreddit.

Shortly after

An interesting observation can be made in sodypop's [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/h09g1/rfeminism_is_looking_for_some_moderators/) about choosing new moderators: Donna_Juanita and avnerd were both nominated by multiple people in the subreddit, made as a moderator somebody nobody else in the subreddit had voted for - and made her a moderator before he made the others moderators.

Fast forward a few months, with more sentiments regarding the hostility toward feminists in a feminist subreddit.

Getting the moderators to moderate has proven to be very difficult


For the purposes of understanding the situation with r/feminism, in order to reduce the amount of discussion by nonfeminists in r/feminism. 

However

This became such a problem that the moderators decided to implement a flair system in r/AskFeminists to distinguish between casual users and people who were well versed in feminism – “Feminist Contributors” as well as “Feminist Expert.” Nobody was ever given the “Feminist Expert” flair – except for me

###SRS is unequivocally against the doxxing of anyone.

Why?

If a SRSter starts or even seems to support doxxing

So if any of us even appears to support doxxing

**If you see someone talking about or trying to dox SRSters or anyone

**It will get taken care of very quickly.**

The admins take doxxing very seriously and it doesn't matter who does it. So they will be equally as fast to crack down on SRSters who are trying to dox or even talk/joke about supporting doxxing.

But they aren't the only ones who will be on your ass. The glorious mass hammer of the Femperial Gynquisitor stretches across the entire Fempire and she will make sure that doxxers never find a home in it. It is something that seriously and truly threatens the entire community so **don't fucking even think about doing it.**

Is that clear for everyone? Good. Now let's get back to advancing the Fempire in the name of BRD.

Woops! Those fields actually matter a whole lot in the real world (this is why MRA's sadly accomplish nothing in the real world in terms of legitimate activism). It's also why atheists in /r/atheism will always stay in /r/atheism.

Let's not forget that child pornography is one of those few things that even in this highly polarized climate

And that's even before we get into the media and how they feel about child pornography or creepshots; the look on Anderson Cooper's face  during the VA interview on CNN just says it all.

I read some post in one of the unfemp subs where it said SRS is winning the propaganda war or whatever and then there are those hilarious posts by demmian trying to counter our message or whatever they think they're doing.

This isn't even a war though; that would imply that Reddit understands how to even fight let alone where and when to fight.

Right now

The real world isn't going to care that Reddit is a bunch of city states or that there is all this nuance in how the content is handled by moderators and not admins or that SRS is a bunch of man-hating meanies with weird emoticons and memes.

And unlike other things that Reddit tries to talk about authoritatively

Here is a free pro-tip to all the aforementioned nerds trying to improve reddit's completely destroyed public image: you don't bring up how you give pizza to a couple randos on the internet in defense to the all the massive traffic brought in from taking and sharing non-consensual sexual pictures of women and children.

lmao

pls discuss and openly gloat about how we are the best at everything

**Possible points of discussion:**

* How did Reddit/Redditors end up this way (ie not understanding why bringing up charity pizza does not cancel out creepshots/child porn)
* What do you think will happen next to Reddit
* On a scale of 1 to amazing
* What does ""brd"" really represent? Is it ""burn reddit down""? ""bake raspberry danishes""? ""butts repeating deliriously""?

**To summarise** - OP joined an online community created to distribute child porn, charged, admitted guilt and got a 5 year probation order and lifetime registry entry rather than 20 year sentence if he'd pleaded innocent and lost. OP now has to undergo regular therapy and probabation meetings.

OP at no point has stated he feels he has done anything wrong, and the therapy and probation meetings he's had have made him mentally ill, and he believes the feds and justice system has ruined his life.

Reddit agree, and in fact downvoting anything remotely critical of child abuse.

Also a lot of OP's story doesn't add up - being made to take polygraphs where that shouldn't happen

Alright Seddit

Me and my buddy, since we threw a cool house party ourselves a while back. We get into state on the way there, talking about previous plays with this girl my buddy is after. For reference purposes, he's Alex.

NOTE: I am graduated

We get to the house party very early, we have a good buzz going from a few games of beer pong. It quickly fills with LBs, something I wasn't hoping for. However, things are going well, the party is okay. I'm slipping in and out of state because there are so few women.

Fast forward to around 11pm. Jello shooters come out, so this was a step out of my comfort zone, but I didn't really give a shit, since the worst she could do is reject me, am I right? Not to mention I was drunk. I chat her up, offer her a jello shooter, and realize she's pretty shy. This works well for me, I end up sitting there awkwardly

Fast forward a little more, not experienced clubbers. All the while, Alex and his girl (another HB7) are having copious amounts of sex in the shower, hottub, bedroom, and upstairs bathroom. I end up approaching her again, and in a drunken slosh of words, and after a short exchange of poorly assembled sentences, and says ""That's your room"". We head to it, and doesn't want to have it again - After removing some clothes and making out for a good 45 minutes

I just texted her a few minutes ago (today is the day after) about making future plans to hang out.

I think the biggest problem I encountered was her lack of confidence - I shine when I have a girl who will reflect my confidence back to me. Let me know what you think

&gt; As a father of a preteen girl I strongly disagree with the content but until they post content that is illegal the admins cannot do much about it nor should they. Report the sub and express your opinion but please limit it to that instead of adding to the already noisy [1] /r/wtf

[Reddit user
&gt; I hate it when I come into a comment thread to leave OP a nasty reply about freedom of expression and someone's stated exactly what I wanted to say

[Reddit user
&gt; Just because you disagree with the content doesn't mean the content should be taken down. As long as it's legal anything should go. What you're asking for is censorship

[Reddit user
&gt; I know this will be downvoted because people like to downvote offensive things. I know you people find this offensive. I find this offensive. However just because you find something offensive doesn't mean it should be deleted, religious oppression, censorship, police brutality, or the war on drugs. However when I see threads like this it makes me truly sad. [(+51)](http://i.imgur.com/INkpf.png)

[Reddit user
&gt; I feel like I'm arguing on the side of pedophiles but I'm just arguing on the side of sanity. Nothing in those images contains nudity therefore there isn't any need to determine the intent. Only if they were naked pictures of children would a court need to determine the intent (whether it was for artistic purposes or lascivious). How is that subreddit's content any different from the Sears catalog of girl's swimsuits? http://www.sears.ca/catalog/swimwear/11135 [(+25)](http://i.imgur.com/aNdZB.png)

&gt; a.) i'm fucking FLABBERGASTED at reddit's baldfaced hypocrisy -- where's the outrage over the MULTIPLE subreddits whose sole dedication is gore/snuff content? i made a post weeks ago questioning their morality and was down-voted into oblivion.

&gt; b.) can you honestly, as if it were a moral imperative?

&gt; c.) practically speaking, serves to divert the (perfectly natural and not of their choosing) urges of these guys into an activity that's not fucking your children. you want to shut down their only channel and push them even nearer the brink?

&gt; tl;dr reddit

[Reddit user
&gt; Wait

&gt; Ooooookay.

&gt; EDIT: I keep getting notifications of replies to this, the general feeling on reddit is ""censorship = bad"". Yet, here, even though this isn't illegal, it bothers people, so they request for it to be censored or removed. It's just ironic, is all. I didn't think my point was that hard to get, and I'm not here to discuss and debate over the definition of what censorship is. I was just making a point that the hivemind is a little hypocritical and ironic. Jesus. [(+17)](http://i.imgur.com/aJrxw.png)

[Reddit user
&gt; How do we know these pictures are not coming from a Sears catalog? The only reason the images are focused on the child is because of the subreddit. These photos could be from anywhere no? [(+16)](http://i.imgur.com/wmIqx.png)

[Reddit user
&gt; Tell that to all the forever alone guys who are virgins. Tell that to all the rape fantasies out there. You can't simply equate desire to the action. You are essentially of the same mindset that my desire to run over 5000 pedestrians in GTA means I WANT to do that in real life. You think that me and my gfs rape fantasies imply I will be raping peeps soon. There is a difference between fantasy and the action. You can't STOP people from having these desires. Be they jailbait, rape fantasies, or violent video games.

&gt; By your logic, because they know it's wrong, but unfortunately have something wrong with them, which they realize. Many seek therapy, many DO look at this type of porn probably, and many would never ever want to hurt a child and actually rape a child.

&gt; Sociopaths are not pedophiles. I would equate pedophiles more to homosexuals

&gt; I can't believe there are people that think desire will lead to action. 1984 much? I am disappoint.

&gt; Oh

[Reddit user
&gt; The joke is that I know more female pedophiles than male and they're more acceptable than male pedophiles

[Reddit user
&gt; Probably an unpopular opinion, as long as it stays within certain boundaries. If that satisfies pedophiles/hebophiles enough to not go any further than fapping to pics of girls that were in no way damaged by the taking of photographs, why judge?

&gt;Rarely do rapists think they're rapists. Rape culture teaches us that rape only happens in a violent way where women kick and scream for you to get off of them, unconscious, seizure). In that situation I would have felt so incredibly violated. Unless your girlfriend explicitly gave you consent to have sex with her even if she had a seizure (which she obviously didn't), you raped her.

on a side note, the shots, and the locations and i let the police in moscow, paris, and rome to be on the lookout for an upskirt photographer in the photo locations. honestly, i don't know what will happen with that since the language barrier made things difficult and sadly, crimes like this are often not high priority. it helps to have photos and web addresses though, well after /r/upskirts said they would knock this shit off. and they ARE going to be on the lookout for upskirt lurkers at weddings.

- Quietly promoting incestual sexual abuse within his post; OP calls it ""early sexual activity with their families"".  Ain't that cute and euphemistic?
- Conflates children's sexuality with an automatic ability to consent to and participate in sexual acts
- Claims pedophilia was just fine and dandy worldwide (tip: it wasn't) until the 1980s obsession with ritual sexual abuse (which turned out to be not going on) but also apparently the pro-pedophilia community has glommed onto it to blame all their legal woes on it...or something.

I was first introduced to ViolentAcrez by Anderson Cooper

This will be a long winded attack on ViolentAcrez and how even if he was just doing it because of trolling, offering nothing more than conciliatory apologies and weak excuses. A company that has no regard for its community, doesn't see the need for a communications director, puts people in positions that they are unqualified to be in, and promotes programmers and gamers into positions that they have no previous background in. 

This is partially a story about ViolentAcrez, is because they don't want to involve themselves properly with the community, they want it to run itself.

Subreddit Drama and Violent Acrez:

My first interaction with this person comes 3 months ago. A 14 year old actress is in a comedy video

[Here is the SRD thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/vrems/some_people_in_rvideos_find_a_14_year_old_actress/c5702rb?context=3) where he is back to being his real self

Here comes the last time I interact with VA before he is outed and deleted his account. The reason for deleting the account was that he was ""tired of reddit"" and that he was moving on. This is untrue, which is also untrue, because he deleted his account for being done with reddit, and then uses other accounts to stay on reddit. It's like he's a lizard, shedding its skin, he's even kind of apologizing for his actions. The problem with this idea is that actions become ingrained over time, even if you are just joking around or trolling

The foreshadowing of some of my comments and his comments is a little mind blowing.  This was from [SRD a month ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/yz2re/drama_in_rnews_as_uviolentacrez_calls_all_gun/c602ydi?context=3), but shows  he had 69 images and the tags he used for those. 

He gets banned from SRD

VA replies to me

&gt;Wow

&gt;*Yawn*  Every time I create something like my Pinterest

Someone replies to him

&gt;you're like a sad and pathetic Frank Zappa.

&gt;i'm afraid you'll never get your senate hearing. does that... change things for you?

Now here is where we examine the disconnect. Even if it was a troll and not real, in any way you view this. 

A very small part of me feels sorry for him, because they don't have a choice if he is their dad or not. His wife I really can't feel sorry for considering she stays with him and prefers to be willfully ignorant of his dark side. I do feel sorry that she has medical issues, but if his family and providing for his wife was his main concern, he would have given up reddit long ago. I wanted him in jail and reported him multiple times to the police and FBI. In my opinion he got off lucky with only losing his job. 

[Ex SRD mod upset with VA being banned and not being given a warning for posting jailbait. Where I explain why he won't be banned from reddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/yz2re/drama_in_rnews_as_uviolentacrez_calls_all_gun/c60q0aj?context=3)

Looking back through [the years](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/7okgl/reddit_awards_best_reddit_of_2008_comment_here_w/), and it paints a much different picture than those at Reddit would like you to believe. Awards for being a pimp daddy, trophies, all were thanks to VA driving up content for this website, which drove up hits, which made more profit. 

The severe disconnect is also very apparent on the employees at reddit. It's like overseeing a gang, this was a good thing as long as they didn't have to deal with the ethical side of what was being posted. This is why they distance themselves from the idea of having any control of subreddits, when they do by having friends, power users, and employees as mods. They don't have to take responsibility for anything posted here, because there is no content actually hosted here, and subreddits are 'city states' which control themselves.

VA known for being proud of his online infamy and achievements, is only sorry that he got caught. Begging for money and jobs online shows how far he has fallen. From being a megalomaniacal sociopath, to a beaten man

HIS IMGUR IS STILL UP WARNING THROUGH GOOGLING HIS NAME AND IMGUR CONTAINS JAILBAIT


I do think maybe he was trying to reform a little, it shouldn't even be a consideration.

###Final Conclusions

The people who run reddit rely on volunteers to run their site because it is cheap, or because if they did it would require more employees and would cut into profit. When do the social issues start hitting their bottom line? Instead of properly dealing with the issues, they face the fall out of people feeling they don't value their privacy, don't value their time spent here, and don't value them. 

This website can't sustain itself like this while still having a policy of allowing teenagers as young as 13 allowed on the website. Without even needing an account you can on occasion view adult material. The admins and VA are now being dragged kicking and screaming by the media through the mud of  their actions that shaped their community,False,,t5_2s4m9,False,,flair,t3_11qguc

I know this subreddit is SRSbsns, /r/EarthPorn and /r/ITookAPicture, among others. I want to talk to you about reports.

Moderators of the default subreddits look at reports very closely. Believe me when I say that a mere 10 reports is almost unheard of in a default subreddit unless the comment or submission is a *blatant* violation of the rules or TOS. Most of the default subreddits have a hands-off approach when it comes to moderating comments (there are usually simply too many violations to enforce consistently so the mods don't even try). However the comments that get reported are the ones that are reviewed by a mod. Comments with 10+ reports are reviewed very closely and are often removed.

Now, sexist, homophobic, transphobic or otherwise hateful comments. All of those are blatant violations of the ~~TOS~~ User Agreement. Mods are supposed to *enforce* the UA. Personally I remove any comment that violates the UA if I see it in the reports queue.

Here's the favor: if you see a comment submitted here that is a blatant violation of the UA

My wife and I got married in 2008. We were two young, especially the guys. She is bisexual and has told me countless times that her women friends were more of a threat than her male friends, but my jealousy was directed squarely at the men. I started getting more and more manipulative, sometimes exhibiting  boderline controlling behavior. I was in a lot of pain, very fearful, and was unable to talk about it, while also struggling with my own sexuality.

We pressed on, I was sure she was wrong &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;. I am a very liberal displaced southerner, not one of these knuckle-dragging rednecks. I was convinced that *she* was wrong for having so many friends and being so popular, and I let her know it. Looking back on this, I have more proof of how much she loves me than any man should ever need.

I joined reddit on January 18, racking up considerable comment karma, until one day a bot told me that my comment had been linked to on [/r/ShitRedditSays](/r/ShitRedditSays). I don't remember the comment, but I remember it was posted by office_fisting_party, who I promptly pulled a one-man bridge on. I started posting ""Fuck SRS"" in any thread that I thought they would show up in, hoping to make SRS famous(ly hated). If [/r/antisrs](/r/antisrs) had existed then, I would have probably been all over it. I even checked out /r/mensrights

I used to lurk SRS, that's me!"" It was on a subconsious level, but I definately showed signs of woman hating. (This is why I try to give redditors a chance. Many of them don't *know* they are shitlords.) 

Here comes the [TW]. This is the first and only time I have ever laid hands on my wife. I knew my anger could get out of control, the habit of rushing out the door when our fights got too intense. I would yell at her, scare her, make my kids cry, and slam the door behind me. I always told her it was so I could calm down and clear my head, and then we could continue our discussion rationally. I know now it was all about manipulation and control. 

Well, she decided to stand in my way. It wasn't courage that made her do it, it was love. I grabbed her by her arms and physically moved her. She didn't fall down, she didn't cry out, she just looked at me. I cannot describe the look of fear in her eyes, but those who have seen it need no description.

I cannot change the past, my misogyny, my anger, and ultimately my fear almost destroyed the greatest woman I will ever know. 

Since that day, before I got to SRS, I always believed I was right. I never realized that scaring someone or manipulating/controlling them was abuse, even though that's how my family was when I was growing up. Now, thanks to SRS, I can't bullshit myself anymore. I can't give myself an excuse for my actions that I believe. If I have feelings I can't deal with today, I have to (gulp) talk about them.

My wife and I are moving out of state in a few weeks. She has been the biggest help to me since that fateful Sunday. I am now ok with her, I listen. The only alternative is to let my anger build until it destroys her. I love her so much. I will do anything to never see that look in her eyes again. And without SRS, well, I don't even want to know where we'd be.


Thank you

**Q: What is SRS?**

**A:** In short, vent and commiserate without being dismissed, silenced through downvotes or needing to explain why the comments suck over and over. This is why the mods are quick to ban and why the rules to keep it a circlejerk are so stringent. It may come off as asshole-ish, but part of the appeal of the sub is that for once we're the majority. It's our space and we don't have to make room for people who don't ""get it"".
More to the point

**Q: Why mock people?**

**A:** Take a second to think about how unwelcoming this site is for some groups. SRS lets those groups know that there is a faction of vocal dissenters and they aren't alone. Most of the commenters who post disparaging remarks about a race/gender/sexual orientation take for granted they'll rarely, but it occasionally causes people to question their remarks.


**Q: How is cutting off rational discourse going to make a difference? If you want to change reddit



**A:** We are not here to ""change reddit."" We don't expect reddit to change. We know most redditors don't really give a shit. They aren't interested in listening and most don't want to sacrifice the upvotes they'll get for a rape joke, and many still do. But realize that it is a tiresome, fruitless experience 98% of the time and we have found fighting fire with fire to be substantially more gratifying.

**A:** This is called a [tone argument](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Tone_argument) and has been used to silence and dismiss marginalized groups for a long time. At the end of the day, bullshit. Especially when those making the tone argument are the ones least affected.

**Q: Aren't you a downvote brigade?**

**A:** No. The accusation itself makes it easy for our detractors to garner support

We do our best to make it clear that SRS's goal is to highlight terrible *upvoted posts*; not to downvote them as some sort of punishment. Being a downvote brigade would ruin the fun and ultimately lead to the demise of the subreddit. In every conceivable way

**Q: What's up with those reply bots I see that respond to comments featured on SRS?**

**A:** Those bots do not belong to SRS. They were created by angry redditors in what we can only guess is an attempt at revenge for being featured. They bring a noteworthy portion of new subscribers to SRS, friends! ♥


**Q: It seems like posts are cherry picked and then held up to be representative of reddit as a whole. Isn't that unfair?**

**A:** If reddit can boast that certain acts of philanthropy are representative of all reddit (when obviously not all redditors were involved in donation drives, but those views are equally representative of the user-base. They can't have it both ways.

**Q: Doesn't all the hate towards white

**A:** 9 times out of 10 when someone calls out a shitposter for their sexist/racist/phobic joke or comment, middle class, cis, able-bodied, straight men that comprise most of reddit's user-base, they can expect the same behavior from us.

Turning the tables like this and watching reddit's reaction to us has been telling. It's important to understand that much of what we do here is satirical. We ridicule thoughtless, a bit ridiculous. 

When you get down to it

Incidentally

**Q: Do you seriously think that white men enjoy special privilege on reddit?**

**A:** [Yes](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/nygqe/effort_privilege_101/)

**Q: Ok I think I get it

**A:** Once more for those in back: SRS is not for questions or discussion. In order to keep the sub from being overrun by concern trolls and shitposters, message the mods. We cant guarantee you'll be unbanned, but we're usually willing to look into it. 

To avoid being banned, just move on. Misguided attempts at ""satire"" that reproduce bigotry, attempting to derail threads, and posting personal information, are all easy ways to incur the wrath of the Archangelles.  

Be good

As you can imagine

Cue [this thread](/http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/17eu0z/its_been_9_months_since_feminist_martyr_anita/) (currently sitting at +1827)

&gt;It's been 9 months since feminist martyr Anita Sarkeesian received $150

Who knew that people donating to a cause they feel strongly about and to better their community is ""sympathy donations"". Are redditors not familiar with the term ""any publicity is good publicity""? Or maybe they're just upset they've already made her point for her.

So what *are* reddit's silencing tactics

Well

**First we have the implications that she is unfit for the job. Because of course redditors are knowledgeable about critical studies and feminist criticism and are qualified to make this judgement.**

&gt;[That's because she's kind of incompetent and has no idea what she's doing. Also

""I have no evidence for this but 'I just don't like her' doesn't sound as good""

&gt;[I wish people would stop calling this woman a feminist. She's not a feminist. She's an idiot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/17eu0z/its_been_9_months_since_feminist_martyr_anita/c84ybh5) [+11]

Because these terms are mutually exclusive. Also

&gt;[well that's obviously because she is not really a gamer. if she was

""real gamer"". Nuff said.

**Secondly

&gt;[Her job now is to get mad at misogyny. She's doing everything she can to keep it going. Her criteria for a sexist depiction of a female are almost impossible to dodge so she'll forever be necessary. When she first created the kickstarter she made sure all the hate comments were funelled into the video for her kickstarter on youtube. She moderates the comments so any reasonable argument against her points disappears while clear cut praise and abuse comes to the forefront. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/17eu0z/its_been_9_months_since_feminist_martyr_anita/c84yhop) [+6]

TIL all film

&gt;[That said, again, makes it kind of really fucking terrible that she so obviously fails at what she claims to want to do. I'd rather someone like Lindsey Ellis do this. Sure, I don't think she really knows that much about being a 'hardcore gamer', but she has shown that she's actually capable of reviewing something with a critical eye, and both having feminist views and being able to step outside them instead of going ""PATRIARCHY!""](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/17eu0z/its_been_9_months_since_feminist_martyr_anita/c84xetu) [+4]

&gt;[What I dislike about her is that she makes herself into a victim to garner sympathy and money. She uses something completely normal

It's not victim blaming if she was making herself out to be the victim! For realz. This is all just a feminist conspiracy!

**But of course no thread on a feminist would be complete without the contribution of some delightful SAWCASM talking points**

&gt;Check

&gt;You've likely been told you're beautiful, 115 pound waif, you're fat; unless you wear Maybellene, you're ugly; men will tell you and show you that you are, in fact, attractive. It's been going on so long that it's just annoying now, but it happens.

&gt;Now, the media's still telling you you're unattractive. The difference now is that you have constant reinforcement that they're right, they're absolutely right. No man truly finds you attractive, your boyfriends and lovers just told you you are because that's what they're supposed to do.

&gt;That's what being a man is like. Women don't tell us we're attractive out of the blue. Women don't stare at us. And the media tells us that without P90X we'll forever remain unattractive.

By the time he got to ""gift exchange"" I interrupted and pointed out we gave examples of both good and bad and that we couldn't possibly cover all of either.  Then asked if those good deeds made up for the blatant bigotry we had gone over earlier. He tried to speak over me and continue reading his list of good things. I told him he was rude and off topic and politely told him to stfu. It was fun!

Several other mangry redditors commented. One asked us if we thought the US or China did a better job re: free speech. Lol.

""Banning bigotry is a slippery slope to banning freezed peaches."" 

&gt;Defining bigotry is a notoriously slippery activity. One person's bigot is another person's outspoken slaughterer of sacred cows. Also, very careful about censoring anything. Freedom of speech includes the freedom to offend, and that includes things that offend us. Once you start restricting speech - even speech that you judge to be hateful or bigoted - you are on a very slippery slope indeed.

**Part II** ([x-post](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepshaming/comments/101z6x/effort_post_evidence_rcreepshots_violates_reddit/) from r/creepshaming) will highlight particular users who are specifically preying on young teenage girls during the schoolday. 

There are several contributors to r/creepshots who seem to either attend or work at high schools. Many of their submissions feature students in the background wearing backpacks and classrooms with  books and furniture that are clearly meant for a high school setting. The following are three particularly troubling cases:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Case 1: Ssj3trunks8**

Most of user Ssj3trunks8's photographs seem to have been taken at the same high school. A number of his submissions are 'upskirt' pictures

[One](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/w6qsz/short_skirt/)

[Two](http://www.reddit.com/r/Upskirt/comments/uy1cf/nice_blue_panties_in_class/)

[Eight](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/uq8ce/girl_in_my_class_bending_over_18/)

[Nine](http://www.reddit.com/r/girlsinyogapants/comments/ur1yn/bending_over_in_class_repost_from_rcreepshots/)

Notice that the only commenter who [questions the age of the girl](http://www.reddit.com/r/girlsinyogapants/comments/ur1yn/bending_over_in_class_repost_from_rcreepshots/c4y03z5) in a picture is [repeatedly](http://www.reddit.com/r/girlsinyogapants/comments/ur1yn/bending_over_in_class_repost_from_rcreepshots/c4y040t) downvoted into invisibility. This is a regular occurrence in such subreddits. In a [different post in r/creepshots by a different user, ""These under age submissions need to stop"" and is also heavily downvoted.

Both of these users are violating the voyeur subreddits' unofficial ""Don't Ask, pretend that the subjects of these pictures are 18+, despite obvious clues that they are younger. Besides not caring about violating the privacy of the women and girls they target, the submitters and users of voyeur subreddits also don't seem to care if they're breaking the law or not.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
**Case 2: throwaway13689**

Judging from the multiple submissions featuring girls in a high school setting

I won't list every submission

Here

&gt;The dedication you put into it. You followed this girl down a long hallway and beyond and still managed to center each shot

In response, it seems throwaway13689 has had a LOT of practice preying on his schoolmates.

In this series of posts ([one](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/zmltw/sparkly_jean_shorts_and_nice_legs/)

In [this post, get to school more often. BTW where is this place, I must know.""

Hardly anyone ever asks whether the girls in throwaway13689's pictures are of age or not. [This is one of the only examples](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/zmkz2/chunky_ass_in_tight_jean_shorts/) I've found where another user questions the age of the subject in the photograph. Neither throwaway13689 nor the mods do anything to confirm whether the girl in this picture (who is clearly very young) is a minor or not. The post in question is still up.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Case 3: Weagleweaglewde**

Now we come to the most disturbing case of all. This user has submitted a picture of a girl 13 days ago entitled, huh?

But maybe Weagleweaglewde is just another student? [Nope](http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/1000f9/16f_here/c69axsq?context=3)

Weagleweaglewde's submissions have been positively received by the r/creepshots community with a net total of 64 upvotes and positive feedback. Users creepytech, 

&gt;If you are a student that just happens to be at the front of the class: well played.
&gt;If you are the teacher: .................................................well played

It seems that all the positive feedback from r/creepshots was encouraging

Who knows how many more pictures of his students Weagleweaglewde will eventually take and put online for perverts to enjoy?

**Weagleweaglewde is not only a predator

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What's particularly disturbing about the voyeur subreddits is that individuals are having their perverse, positive comments, and sometimes [explicit requests for more images of the same girl](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepShots/comments/zuigi/chick_i_sit_next_to_in_class/). In short, these voyeur subreddits normalize and encourage predatory behavior.

Students should be able to attend class without having their privacy violated by fellow students and trusted authority figures like teachers. Girls should be able to go to school without worrying that sexually suggestive images of them are being uploaded to popular websites like Reddit for thousands to view and ogle.

**How many more girls are going to be violated and exploited before these subreddits are taken down?**

[SRS starts here, the reasons it's evolved the way it has, it all makes a hell of a lot of sense after spending a few minutes sifting through the ruins of /r/LadyBashing.

The idea behind that sub was basically the same as SRS

All this to say, and the Fempire's evolution and outlook were informed by how reddit had dealt with our predecessors.

**GENESIS - Fall 2010**

[In the beginning, basically alone, save for a few weary refugees from LadyBashing and other mostly [\(but not totally\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/TransphobiaProject/) inactive subs.  reddit_sux created [the original SRS pastime,](http://web.archive.org/web/20101101061224/http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays) our oldest tradition, the game [""Guess the Redditor,""](http://www.reddit.com/user/reddit_sux/submitted/) in which you read comments and guess which ones come from reddit, and which ones come from Stormfront.

**DARK AGES - Winter &amp; Spring 2011**

Like untold millions of others, but nothing would ever get more than a handful of comments, and sometimes the sub would go weeks without a post.  Some rando named InstantKarma got ahold of the sub in a redditrequest but didn't do anything to grow it and promptly abandoned it himself.  (In a fun little episode, he returned one year and 20,000 subscribers later to denounce what SRS had become.)

**REVIVAL - Summer &amp; Fall 2011**

At some point, a year ago, [mods.](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/j94lu/request_only_mod_of_rshitredditsays_is_idle/)  From here on out SRS had a steady flow of [content](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/jflzd/good_little_list_of_some_of_reddits_racism/) and growth.

1337101814.0,togcz,[META] On ableism,ArchangelleRazielle,393,178,200,"Yesterday, and clearly some discipline was in order.

It was not, like every other group of people on this planet, fuck up on a pretty regular basis.  What was alarming was SRS's collective response to it.By the time I saw it and removed it, it had accumulated nineteen net upvotes.  It was displayed in my RES as [19|0].  Nobody had reported it.  Nobody had called it out.  Almost twenty people on SRS had seen this comment and decided it was worthy of their passive approval, and everybody, until I came along, had mindlessly overlooked the fact that a very ableist comment was being mindlessly approved of in SRS.

This is far from being the first such event, for a long time, and I have talked with other disabled SRSers who have experienced the same. Little effort has been made, however, to make this a welcoming community for SRSers with disabilities.

Until now, collectively act like casual bigotry against me and people like me is acceptable.  It's not, and no longer will it be treated as such.  From this point on, ableism will be much less tolerated in SRS.  Those who make ableist comments in SRS or affiliated subreddits will be reprimanded and, likely, benned.  Everyone is encouraged to call it out where they see it, and to report it (either by hitting the report button, in PMs on reddit or in the IRC

If you get benned for ableism, and chances are that we will have mercy on you.

Otherwise, though, just please remember that we, people with disabilities, are among you, that this is our community just as much as anyone else’s, and that it is your responsibility to refrain from being carelessly hostile to us if you wish to remain part of this community.

&gt; I object to inane, I reject that discourse, while maintaining a commitment to fair and equal treatment for women. If that makes me not a feminist, then I don't want to be one...of course, that would probably put me solidly in the company of most of the original founders of feminism, so no sweat lost.

[A survey](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/171wki/women_of_reddit_if_you_could_change_one_thing/) launched today to gauge whether men can take criticism from women in a constructive way has found that 98% percent of men on reddit can not

An additional 95% has also decided to return the criticism to the women themselves

Here are some excerpts from the survey.

**Criticism**:

&gt; To understand that no means no

Reactions:

&gt; [Do you have any fucking idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/171wki/women_of_reddit_if_you_could_change_one_thing/c81gwcf) how many times a woman has feigned disinterest

.

&gt; [I'm sure that ""yes"" means ""yes

&gt; [I would blame women for this. If you really want ""no"" to mean ""no""

**Criticism**:

&gt; [If we say something: ""OMG just listen!""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/171wki/women_of_reddit_if_you_could_change_one_thing/c81fq5f)

&gt; If we stay quiet and only listen: ""OMG do you even care?!?"" [+58]

**Criticism**:

&gt; I know

Reactions:

&gt; [The problem there starts when some women \(not all, etc.) for weeks on end and then, at the end of it, say that they want to be just friends. There is nothing more frustrating in the world than being led on and having your time wasted by somebody that you thought was attracted to you. [+31]

**Criticism**:

&gt; Slut-shaming. Or avoiding a woman because she is perceived to be a slut. (I'd change this about women too) [+51]

Reactions:

&gt; [Women are far more harsh and far more cruel to other women regarding ""slut-shaming"" than men could ever be. At least in civilized countries.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/171wki/women_of_reddit_if_you_could_change_one_thing/c81g53d) [+32]

&gt;This has to be someone trolling. There are FAR too many intimate details in the OP's post for someone that was essentially raped. 

Yup

&gt;I want everyone to really think hard about this and how they would likely act if they were raped.

Followed by a quote of the story with elements bolded with regards to what the rapist was doing to her. 

&gt;All over your face? Not just... on your face? This is the second time you mentioned his cum.

She's using slightly more descriptive language than I might have? Well then

The saddest part about this particular thread though? She felt compelled to respond with *pictures of her abused body* to appease this douchey motherfucker. That she felt like she had to do that just goes to show how fucked up such a response even is. His response to that is highly downvoted

Of course

&gt; Going to Reddit first

Yeah

&gt;Not going to the cops because it is her birthday FRIDAY?

Fuck this guy. One of the last things she has to look forward to in the short term is that in a few days she'll be able to celebrate her birth. And because she doesn't want that one day to be ruined by an intrusive police investigation and scandal, that's all the proof he needs that she's making it all up.

&gt;Either it happened and she is looking for attention desperately

Uh, another feeeemale looking for ATTENTION amiriteguys""

&gt;why else would she come here if she won't listen to advice

Yes, they just felt like making up a huge, detailed story with photos on an anonymous account on Reddit. If it weren't for you, she would have gotten away with the many things she would have to gain in that situation, including... oh wait, there's *no reason someone would make this up*. What motive could they possibly have to do something like that? They're not incriminating anyone, they gain nothing from posting the story online

Finally

&gt;Ok

This doesn't take much thought. He was lying on top of her.

&gt;From how many times you mentioned him playing with your breasts and how many times you kept saying he throat fucked you. I'm sorry if I seem insensitive but it just seems like a fap story to me.

1361298776.0,18txpg,"[META][TW] Warren Farrell, noted men's rights activist, is having an IAmA right now. Judging by these quotes from him about pedophilia, incest, and sexual harassment,ArchangelleGabrielle,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/18txpg/metatw_warren_farrell_noted_mens_rights_activist/

Warren Farrell is doing an IAmA right now. I'm not linking to it because I'm asking y'all to keep your circlejerking contained to this post/SRS and not in his AMA simply because it's always more fun to jerk in the Prime and I think we all want to see him answer some actual questions about

[From](http://manboobz.com/2012/11/21/what-mens-rights-guru-warren-farrell-actually-said-about-the-allegedly-positive-aspects-of-incest-note-its-even-more-repugnant-than-that-sounds/): 

&gt; Mother-son incest represents 10 percent of the incidence and is 70 percent positive, not even from the negative experience. “Girls are much more influenced by the dictates of society and are more willing to take on sexual guilt**.”

That quote literally is a case of actual misandry.

Also:

&gt; The father-daughter scene, calling explicitly for positive female experiences, Farrell discovered that 85 percent of the daughters admitted to having negative attitudes toward their incest. Only 15 percent felt positive about the experience. **On the other hand, statistics from the vantage of the fathers involved were almost the reverse — 60 percent positive 10 percent mixed, and 20 percent negative. “Either men see these relationships differently,” comments Farrell, “or I am getting selective reporting from women.”**

Also:

&gt; In a typical traumatic case, drunkenly imposes himself on his young daughter. **Genital petting may have started as early as age eight with first intercourse occurring around twelve. Since the father otherwise extends very little attention to his daughter, his sexual advances may be one of the few pleasant experiences she has with him.**

Also:

&gt; “When I get my most glowing positive cases, sensual style of life, wherein sex is an outgrowth of warmth and affection. **It is more likely that the father has good sex with his wife, and his wife is likely to know and approve — and in one or two cases to join in [the incest].**”

[Also](http://articles.latimes.com/1993-08-09/news/vw-22148_1_feminist-warren-farrell):

&gt; Sexual harassment legislation is a male-only chastity belt. With women holding the key.

So there we have it. For so long we have seen redditors own the pretention that they are part of a good community. A caring community. A community that has empathy for others. One that donates to charity and helps out people in need. A moral force for good in the world. But no longer.

Nope. Now reddit is filled with shitbags who are entirely aware that they are shitbags, women and phonies. And they're pleased with this state of affairs. I wonder if they'll ever be any less angry, though.

Ready to play? let's go!

1.

&gt; its just the religion of peace folks

2.

&gt; This is what I dont understand - why any self-respecting progressive liberal would support mass immmigration of people who are [1] anything but  liberal and progressive?

3.

&gt; Speaking a modicum of English and filling in all the required paperwork is NOT ENOUGH. You really must demonstrate that you WANT to be British, and not just to continue being Indian, Pakistani etc complete with your own laws and backwards religions and practices brought from your homeland.

4.

&gt; The bouncers and the club-goers need to realize that this was not an attack but just an enhanced facet of the vibrancy of vigorous multi-culturalism. 

5.

&gt; It is hard to move forward when we keep immigrating people living in the stone age into our society. They bring with them a backwards and often violent culture. They don't wish to adapt and move forward

6.

&gt; If they are French-born

7.

&gt; Throw them out of France. We don't need them here, they want to replace it with the east.

8.

&gt; Shhh

9.

&gt; Such a peace loving religion.

10.

&gt; I'm sure the Muslim community will be outraged that some of it's members committed such an atrocity. I mean

11.

&gt; And that's basically what happens when you fail to understand the difference between ""granting citizenship to those who will bring good"" and ""letting anyone in"".

12.

&gt; Muslim apologists that are just as ignorant as the 'extremists'. Y'all need to fuck off and either A) get the fuck out of the 'West' or B) Stop attacking our way of life. People are gay

13.

&gt; Here come the apologists for savag.. I mean muslims. Go on

14.

&gt; Extremist Mulsims are taking over Europe

15.

&gt; 8-10% of France is Muslim (6 million people). France needs their own reconquista.

So a few months back the owner of In Mala Fide, but seriously don't fucking read it if you even remotely think it might affect you. It's pretty much the worst article ever. Let me just quote one line from it, so you get what I'm talking about here:

&gt;Women should be terrorized by their men; it’s the only thing that makes them behave better than chimps.

Anyway

&gt;I think that in most discussions on domestic violence, but we're also led to believe that men beat women just because. Maybe dinner was overcooked, maybe she put too much eyeliner on, maybe it was Tuesday...I would assume the majority of men who hit their girlfriends or wives don't do it ""just because""...they do it because the woman keeps emotionally manipulating and abusing the poor guy to the point where, non-violent as he may be, he reaches his breaking point, snaps and then proceeds to lay the smackdown as they say. Violence is not okay

'domestic violence is bad

And then GirlWritesWhat shows up:

&gt;&gt;&gt;[I used to live under a young couple with a baby. I'd listen as she followed him from room to room upstairs, throwing things, screaming. After about an hour, he'd eventually hit her, and everything would go quiet. An hour after that, they'd be out with the baby in the stroller, looking perfectly content with each other.](http://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRA/comments/y0nod/X/c5rjmh3?context=1)

&gt;&gt;&gt;A man I know who has experience with men in abusive relationships would get his clients to answer a questionare. Things like, how would you rate the sex?"" 100% of men in reciprocally abusive relationships said ""yes"" to the first, and ""scorching"" to the second.

&gt;&gt;&gt;He also posited that the much-quoted cycle of violence--the build-up, orgasm and post-coital bliss.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Erin Pizzey called it ""consensual violence"", surprise surprise, likely because our ""never EVER hit a woman"" mentality has those men waiting until they completely lose control of their emotions before giving their women what they're demanding.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The DV in Sleeping with the Enemy is the most rare form out there, and refuse to address women's instigation and participation in violence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;**I don't really find too much in the article that strikes me as seriously ethically questionable.** DV isn't pretty. Neither is the article.

&gt;On another note. It's kind of fucked up that our culture has such an unusual amount of hatred towards rapists.

But r/MR is not only for people who hates women. It also brainstorms about [ways in which the MRM can help women](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/o7ibc/ways_in_which_the_mrm_can_help_women/). Top comment:

The above principle is embodied in this post: [""Here's an example of how and why many people believe that rape is everywhere... because their definition of rape includes every sexual misadventure""](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ovwah/heres_an_example_of_how_and_why_many_people/)

The link is to a case of r/atheism victim-blaming which was featured on reddit. The comments are surprisingly reasonable
___

If there is one thing MRA's are horrified at, the top comment is the following gem:

&gt;I am afraid of you. I am afraid you will decide that I am looking at your boobs and successfully sue me for sexual harassment. I am afraid you will get drunk and hit on me, decide what I have said offends your femininity, again with the suing. I am afraid not to talk to you, because not talking to you and talking to others represents being sexist and is therefore sexual harassment (this actually happened to me, I almost got fired). I am afraid to sleep with you because you might decide it was rape. I am afraid to not sleep with you because you might accuse me of rape to get even, and today that accusation is as bad as having done the deed. I am afraid to fall in love with you because you would have sole control over any and all children we have until birth, when I pick up financial responsibility for said children even if I didn't want sad children.

&gt;Yes

Be sure to check out the second top comment at the submission too.

&gt;This sounds perfectly reasonable to me (assuming she didn't coerce the teen in any way). Now let's start sentencing males in a similar situation the same way and I'll be happy.

I'm sure there are more equalists out there that *also* can't wait to make their 16 year old students pregnant!

One category has been kinda underrepresented in these posts. I look to rectify this in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/nzo8p/media_focus_on_rapes_and_other_female_miseries/)

&gt;My concern with this article comes from what’s missing—at least up until the very end. “I’m still chilled by the matter-of-fact explanation I received as to why it is women who collect firewood,’ one woman here explained. ‘When the men go out, they’re killed. The women are only raped.’”

&gt;Well

&gt;Because men are inherently disposable and meant to die in wars silly.

/u/Maxxters submitted [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=hE9FFvIYPg8) which attempts to place sexual assault within its broader social context. In this case, enthusiastically or otherwise. The video uses the scenario to urge individuals to take action if they feel that anyone is too drunk to be fully cognizant of the situation or to give consent, uncomfortable, or unsafe. Understanding and acting on nonverbal cues of potential discomfort or lack of safety is a central part of the video. [TRIGGER WARNING on the video and on the comments.]

But luckily the redditors of /r/sex are prepared to call this video on its shit.

I click to open the comments.

Victim blaming... victim blaming *everywhere*.

And /u/librtee_com wins gold.

&gt; [I agree; all these people should step in and help her.
But there is one person who is overlooked as having a responsibility to step in and avert this: the woman herself.
I find it rather shocking that at no place in this video does it suggest that the woman should avoid drinking herself into a stupor. That the sole responsibility for avoiding the rape falls on those around her.
Again

/u/Dubstercat agrees

[](/ironicat)

/u/Maxxters steps in with what is clearly a controversial interjection: 

&gt; [Binge drinking is one thing. Rape and sexual assault are completely different. When a person chooses to binge drink

But /u/librtee_com is onto her totally misogynistic outlook on the situation: 

&gt; [If I make a video suggesting you shouldn't walk through the ghetto at 3AM
No. It's just common sense.
Binge drinking is not 'wrong, at home, at a club, in your home town, in a foreign country - binge drinking is a potentially dangerous activity. Fact.
This video steps through every person and what they can do to help this person
It just paints the woman as this hapless victim who is in no control over her life
In fact, who have no self-determination or ability to fight back, who are just easy targets of rape until some white knight on a horse comes along and saves them.
Fuck that. The creepy guy shouldn't have done what he did. The bystanders should have done something. But fuck

Yes

[](/ironicat)

/u/Sionainn gets honourable mention in this category: 

&gt; [I'm sorry but where's the part about the chick taking responsibility for herself by not drinking so much she can't control her actions. This is putting the blame for her actions on everyone else. Obviously the guy is trying to get her drunk and take advantage

This is because SRS is literally run by goons.*

It's my first effort post since my return! Hooray!

Brad Wardell

But up until very recently

You can read the article to get a really detailed timeline of what happened, it's not short at all.

From 2008 to 2010, verbal, and electronic

&gt; E-mail messages included in the records go back as far as March, a comment that Miseta was chosen to go to a conference ""not just because you're 'hot',"" and **a 100-question 'purity test' that he asked her to take and then send him her score from.** The purity test includes questions like, ""Have you engaged in group sex?,"" 'Have you engaged in intercourse with an unconscious person, while conscious?,"" and

&gt; Witness depositions included in the case documents refer to **multiple comments from Wardell to female employees about their breast and bra sizes**

&gt; In May 2010

That last bit of physical harassment led to Miseta emailing Wardell and making an extremely professional and polite email to **her harasser**. Here is an excerpt:

&gt; 1. Please never touch my hair or any of my body parts; not even jokingly.

&gt; 2. Please do not talk about my private life or about my boyfriend/future husband in any terms especially negative terms.

&gt; 3. Please be careful with your ""jokes"" which are at many times inappropriate, but everyone present.

&gt; 4. Please keep your negative personal opinions of others (including family members and/or coworkers) not present at the time of your comments, it puts me in a very uncomfortable position.

&gt; With the above few behavioral changes

Wow! What a nice email; I'm sure Brad will respond in kind! And he actually does in the beginning with ""Thank you for bringing these up to me as I certainly do not want you to feel uncomfortable at work."" But all the basic human decency dies right there:

&gt; 3, vulgar, and embarrassing person and I'm not inclined to change my behavior. If this is a problem, you will need to find another job.**

&gt; 4, I recommend finding another job.

&gt; **I'm not some manager or coworker of yours. I own the company. It, not vice versa. **The company is not an end unto itself, it is a means to an end which is to further the objectives of its shareholders (in this case, me).**

[...]

&gt; I sincerely apologize for offending you while on our trip. I certainly would never intentionally try to upset you or make you uncomfortable and will endeavor to avoid doing so in the future. **However, vulgar and embarrassing person)**.

Huh! Taking his advice to leave

Shortly after she leaves in August 2010, a really profoundly anaconda of unrequited fecal matter](http://kotaku.com/5662673/developer-turns-to-mod-maker-to-fix-broken-game). In December of 2010, Alexandra files a lawsuit against Wardell for sexual harassment. But how are these two things related? I'll get back to that in a hot minute.

Well

Wardell mad. He real mad.

So remember like two paragraphs back how I talked about Elemental being a horrible game? **Three weeks after Wardell loses the motion to dismiss**, and/or stole"" the Elemental marketing materials, analytics, and trade show information"". Huh! That's a quite serious allegation! Let's see what people who worked at the company say...

&gt; Witness statements found in the response from Miseta's attorneys, so that she ""knew where [Miseta's] files were"" and had access to relevant Google docs. Others had no recollection of Wardell or HR manager Angela Marshall (Wardell's sister-in-law) ever mentioning missing documents causing trouble with Elemental.**

&gt; **A former Stardock employee, Elemental had many technical issues that had nothing to do with its marketing. The employee also added that at the time, nobody mentioned any materials having gone missing or any sabotage having taken place and showed Kotaku communications from Wardell that indicated satisfaction with how Miseta's staff replacement was taking over the review kit and review guide process**.

Right

*Sidenote: How fucked up is it that the HR person is fucking related to the sexual-harassment-happy CEO? Jeez

TL;DR: **Woman gets sexually harassed by a dudebro and stands up for herself. Dudebro doubles down on his misogyny and tells her to leave. She leaves and then sues his ass. Dudebro tries to get the case dismissed but fails miserably. Dudebro is super mad and then makes up some total bullshit about how the woman helped fuck up a game that was actually complete ass for totally unrelated reasons.**

Now

You see

[First response on a forum](http://www.quartertothree.com/game-talk/showpost.php?p=3211297&amp;postcount=187)

&gt; ... She later emailed me telling me she was mad about the incident - to which I apologized for hurting her feeligs but also insisted that I watch what jokes I tell around the office. (To understand the context, Simpsons references, Robot Chicken references**, etc.)...

Family guy jokes: truly a spitting image of professionalism.

[But it don't stop](http://www.littletinyfrogs.com/article/430919/No_its_not_up_to_everyone_else_to_adapt_to_you):

&gt; **And just in case it wasn't obvious enough: No one has ever been ""sexually harassed"" here.** If someone is told jokes they deem inappropriate, imo, harassment and illegal. But it's NOT okay to demand that everyone else, when not in your presence, conform to whatever standards of behavior you think they should have.

The backstory: A woman was on her way back to San Francisco with her SO and their two dogs. She paid $1, I dunno, *keeping her dogs alive*. United Airlines thought it meant something else, so when she landed and attempted to pick up her two doggies, some baggage handler informed her one of them died en route. They then lied to her about her dog being taken to a vet for autopsy, when in actuality she was in a back room while a supervisor decided how to handle the situation.

To paraphrase, we feel that it's not our place to try and reappropriate these terms or to make joking references to a genocide and an incredibly sensitive Jewish heritage. In the same vein, joking references to Hitler, even as a sarcastic counter to antags who wrongly use it to refer to SRSters, are inappropriate. We know people outside of SRS use these words and phrases in a disrespectful manner. We should not do the same for the sake of circlejerking.

[I posted a thread about this](http://i.imgur.com/Vqn0Eii.png), it was censored. When I messaged their modmail, I was told by yellowmix (who is the only /r/feminisms moderator who has *ever* responded to *anything* - and I'm pretty sure until recently they were the *only* active moderator) that that was because they were ""planning to post a meta thread on the subject soon"". [They did post a survey](http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/1722uf/community_feedback_session_the_inaugural/) that seems likely to have been on this subject (evidently I missed it when it was going on - go figure), but no follow-up ever occurred, and there's no indication of what the results were, much less of anything ever coming of it.

So what did we learn? Well

First, or race (along with many other axes!) because you have no idea what their intention is. They don’t get that being a minority can be scary. They seem to forget that *within their own lifetimes* violence against gender and sexual minorities has not only been condoned, but encouraged. They assume that the default experience is that of a straight, white cis man and that anyone who has a different perspective on situations that do not threaten SAWCSMs is overreacting.

Second, it’s straight up using slurs to put someone in their place. Compare and contrast with ‘jerk number one.  

Third, and they love the idea of good types of minorities and bad types of minorities. This is literally the same ‘jerk as “I don’t hate black people, I hate n*****s”. I don’t hate gays, I hate f**s. And unlike the “every white man is a special snowflake who deserves to be judged on their individual merits (which are so clearly superior- doh’ho’ho)” ‘jerk, every single member of every single minority is a representative of everyone in their minority and all minorities. Reddit, your compassion for GSMs is a mile wide and an inch deep. You love Jane Q. Taxpayer if she keeps her queerness to herself, but as soon as she’s someone whom you actually have to deal with you can’t wait to throw her under the bus.

And all this together has the cumulative impact of establishing straight men as gatekeepers of the rights, I think that [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/18isml/my_lesbian_friend_for_the_win/c8fa7l0) comment sums it up the best. If the oppressed aren’t up to your standards, if they make you feel uncomfortable, or weird, or are mean to you, then fuck ‘em. They get no rights. They get no privileges. They get no inclusion. It’s literally an acknowledgement that you hold all the cards, all the power


In closing, Reddit. Fuck you and your ally flair and your hatred of the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts. We don’t need or want your lukewarm, self-important alliance. We don’t want your permission to be who we are and we don’t give a shit about your acceptance. Either you support inclusion of *all* GSMs or you don’t support the inclusion of *any* of us.

I already linked to this comment in the previous submission

&gt;[If you wanted to pinpoint the most primitive culture on the entire planet

&gt;[This is a place that still practices cannibalism

What the fuck.  Okay, there is nothing inherently immoral about cannibalism.  Murder is certainly wrong, but not all cannibalism practised in PNG was due to headhunting, and even when it was, cannibalism wasn't the reason for the tribal warfare.  I've even heard anecdotally that when one PNG tribe was visited by an anthropologist just after World War II and was explaining the events to them, they were shocked at how immoral the Western world was that they would kill people and then just *waste* the bodies!  Secondly superstitious belief is only ""magic"" when non-white people have it.  Haitians, Africans and Papuans believe in magic.  White people believe in god (wow, lucky numbers

MOST IMPORTANTLY

Reddit is always happy to soliloquise about how different the cultures of the different American states are

When one commenter calls them out:

&gt;[Are you seriously making a connection between 'primitive' cultures/practices and rape?](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1csqvy/a_us_academic_has_been_gangraped_by_an_armed_mob/c9job9b) [+21|-27]

A [brilliant, but is downvoted by Reddit because it's not STEMy or racist enough presumably [+45|-49]

Then there's this shitstain of a comment:

&gt;[Papua has little law, and rape is so culturally acceptable they have a huge festival (called the yam festival) in parts where any man wandering around is fair game for forced sex.  So, what do you expect?](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1csqvy/a_us_academic_has_been_gangraped_by_an_armed_mob/c9jmwum) [+22|-10]

Again, did you know they don't even wear fedoras?!?!

Then mention of the yam festival, linguistically or ethnically similar to New Guinea Highlanders than the average redditor is.  Also, it's probably completely apocryphal.  I know because I read about this supposed behaviour in the course of writing my thesis on [Papuan Tip languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papuan_Tip_languages), of which Kilivila is one and I personally asked [the world's biggest expert on Trobriand Islanders](http://www.mpi.nl/people/senft-gunter), who said he'd never witnessed it over the 30 or so years he'd been travelling there.

Note, this article just represents yet another chance to go on a racist circlejerk.  I'm going to go lie down and weep now :(

A Wisconsin school district runs a few programs emphasizing diversity and racial issues. One of these programs, one of which includes wearing a wristband which reads ""White Privilege"" as a reminder to be more conscious of privilege on a day-to-day basis. Not as a matter of policy or a mandatory policy even for students who are trying to be conscious of these things, but just a suggestion, peripherally linked to one program the school supports.

So naturally it was posted to /r/libertarian and [blown out of proportion in the most transparent move from covert to overt racism many of that sub's users have ever made](http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1a55ey/wisconsin_education_officials_want_students_to/).

But apparently I was wrong to give these people the benefit of a doubt just because my libertarian friends IRL support a safety net, racial profiling, foreign policy) on disadvantaged groups worldwide and in the United States in particular. No - /r/libertarian has gone straight-up Stormfront. The comments in this thread are more than just being young and ignorant and believing that you live in a ""just world"" where everybody has an even shot and success is earned, and are seriously some of the nastiest stuff I've seen in recent memory. I can't laugh at this stuff yet but maybe some of you more seasoned veterans can:

&gt; This sort of thing is the face of true racism. I (as a white guy) am told that because I look similar to people who did bad things a hundred years ago

Yeah, apparently, made to feel vaguely guilty for a couple of minutes on one particular day. When will white people ever get a break from the constant abuse hurled their way? Suddenly becoming conscious of how subtle messages and depictions might affect people once they're of your race isn't suspicious at all.

But now we're back in the mire

&gt; Examples of White Privilege:

&gt; Pronouncing words properly.

&gt; Literacy.

&gt; Growing up with two parents in the home.

&gt; Conscientious family decision to value education.

&gt; Teaching personal responsibility to children.

&gt; Cooking meals at home and eating properly (as opposed to buying cereal and gatorade at 7/11 with EBT).

&gt; Not robbing or stabbing people.

    [*thing at the top* **thing at the bottom**](/liberal)

Goes to

[*Sorry

Hueypriest smoking poo also works like this.

    [*thing at the top* **thing at the bottom**](/huey)


goes to e.g.

&gt;Yes, by SRS-type feminists, because she dared to point out that women can be perpetrators of domestic violence.

Why is it that only Erin Pizzey and the MRAs claim she got death threats and was forced into exile? Am I missing something here? All I can find is Erin Pizzey saying she received death threats and MRAs parroting that. Also

Someone posted a video of a woman yelling at MRAs. Erin's thoughts?

&gt;Number 1 – Is feminism a cult?
&gt;I have to say, Thinking and Emotions. The whole issue of Undue Influence and people joining in because they believe it will make them appear a better person and also provide instant sisterliness and group membership, it's significant. If you do things the right way, you are a good feminist. If you don't, it allows the feminist cult members to detect you and cast you out. Ex-feminists also have the same pattern of recovery as cult members. It's spooky. Do you see feminism as a cult, and what are the most cult like elements of feminism, that you have encountered?

Um. I don't even know what to say to that. Erin thinks feminists are a culty bunch though.

&gt;I certainly think - and this is why I work for A Voice for Men - which is probably the most forward-thinking and the best platform for those of us who want to end the war, and Apartheid, we can see traces of this in the Gender War.
&gt;
&gt;What we need to recognize is that actually the Gender War was declared by the feminists in the late 60s and 70s to create a billion dollar industry that would ringfence a huge amount of money i.e. a billion for VAWA alone

The closest approximation we managed to come up with this time was to ask about white privilege. Using that metric, it's probably safe to say that SRSters are mainly white, and PoCs are the minority.

Although about a third of SRSters eschew the White Knighthood in favour of meeting shitlords with a glorious hail of dildzbullets as a scorntrooper, with the traditional battlecry, ""Reddit Delenda Est!"" echoing in the air.

I'm sorry to say, with 33% clearly favouring pink Starbursts. Obviously, this is the result of some sort of oppression against other Starburst colours. I recommend we institute some sort of selective Starburst campaign to boost the opportunities of the Oppressed 11 - yellow and orange Starbursts.

The Misandry Militia is easily most popular

**SAWCSM REPORT

(For the purposes of this analysis

Firstly, and so on.

| | | |
:--|:--|:--
&amp;nbsp; | Raw numbers | Percentage
5/5 | 297 | 31.4%
4/5 | 312 | 33.2%
3/5 | 189 | 20.0%
2/5 | 104 | 11.0%
1/5 | 36 | 3.81%
0/5 | 8 | 0.85%

Next let's take a look at some of the most common non-SAWCSM letter combinations. The two most numerous, ablebodied white etc., 122). Right under that was OAWCsW (not heterosexual AWCs Women, 111). Those three together make up a cool 37.5% of those surveyed.

So, VAST majority of SRSters experience oppression on at least one axis. There's a higher percentage of SAWCSMs in this survey, compared to survey 2 (29%), which is probably a reflection of the larger subscriber numbers. If you're drawing from Redditors, you're going to get people who reflect Reddit's demographic trends.

###IN CONCLUSION:

WE'RE STILL AWESOME FUCK YEAH

Also, a lot of relief and happiness and also amazing misanderandical anger.

SRS is...

    Radical, postmodern, funny, clever. Mostly it's just a relief that I'm not the only one.

...in a nutshell.

--------

&gt; Just so everyone knows

Remember folks: rape is a product!

&gt; ... India is so hopped up on the issue of rape right now that everyone is speaking against it just to get some the attention and favour of the general public. [\[+129\]](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/17m4ky/the_times_of_india_is_running_14_page_ads_on_why/c86uizo)

All of this marketing hooplah just serves to distract from the REAL problem here -- that more people are aware of and speaking out against rape.

Most people

&gt; What is the definition of womanhood?

&gt; Is it a flat belly

&gt; Is it umpteen hours spent on the treadmill?

&gt; Is it rash driving and drunken parties?

&gt; The definition of womanhood is not

&gt; the size of your bra

&gt; But the space between your ears.

&gt; How you think is how womanly you are.

&gt; The true test of your womanhood is

&gt; how you treat a man.

&gt; All men. Any man. Every man.

&gt; If you do not respect a man

&gt; you are only half a woman. [\[+11\]](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/17m4ky/the_times_of_india_is_running_14_page_ads_on_why/c86xdqw)

A nice rewritten version of the poem that forces Reddit's female readers to check their damn privilege! Thankfully, cisgender men. 

But nahhhh. It is a fun and insightful rewrite of the OP's poem

&gt; It is 50% right.
There is no value in respecting women then acting like an arse to other men. Women do not deserve special recognition
The real message is for humans to love other humans. I appreciate the circumstances surrounding this ad but it does kind of demonize men and victimize women in its tone of delivery. [\[+33\]](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/17m4ky/the_times_of_india_is_running_14_page_ads_on_why/c86v2wc)

It's important to know that disrespectful people don't deserve respect -- *especially* women. We also must be careful, statistics show that they're responsible for [99% of all rapes committed in the United States](http://www.oneinfourusa.org/statistics.php), but eh. Statistics are misandric by nature, anyway.

Excerpt from submission:

&gt;My sister found upskirt pictures of herself on a family friend's son's phone. She is 17 and he is 15. I understand that they are both minors but I am seriously disturbed by this thought. The guy has been harassing her lately for sex as he is 'desperate to lose his virginity' and keeps sending her texts to pester her. They have never been romantically involved and he is merely a family friend.

&gt;She has spoken to me and my dad about this. My dad seems to think that she should not confront him as this would ruin the relationship with their family and could ruin this kid's life. He also said that it's her fault because she wore a short skirt that day. (I am so angry at my dad for saying this) I personally completely disagree with not confronting him

Naturally

&gt;[He's 15

[yeah don't go to the police

I don't get this ""go to the police""-shit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z0h0u/my_sister_17_years_old_found_nonconsensual/c60f4d2) Why not try to work this out?

&gt;[""nothing wrong with that. Some people find the super skinny look attractive.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19gm2y/is_this_wrong/c8ntvtm)[+16]

So there's nothing wrong with encouraging eating disorders. How else are girls going to meet Redditors' incredibly high standards?

&gt;""Yes it's wrong

&gt;[""Maybe

And then

&gt;[""Or he'll get friend zoned because that's actually how the world works.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19gm2y/is_this_wrong/c8ny1m5)[+23]

For comparison the person saying that the friend zone doesn't exist get's downvoted.

What we should be doing is stopping ignorant racist, prejudice, sexist, etc people and not tolerating them, not building society around them by giving others special treatment* (+4) [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/126q5d/as_a_middle_class_white_girl_about_to_go_to/c6ssqp8)

**A voice of reason appears:**
&gt;*Umm… there are not supposed to be quotas on minorities and women. I don’t think you understand how Affirmative Action works. EDIT: Reddit is full of jaded upper-class white males. Who knew?*

**Uh oh! Someone get in here and do some ‘splaining at this logical individual:**
&gt;*I don’t think you understand how at least some companies put it into practice. In order to not appear to be biased they hire minorities over other people who are better suited to the position.  I have watched this happen. My company has had a revolving door of minorities that don’t work out

1350566258.0,11or9e,[Effort](?) A woman is being blackmailed? Reddit knows who the true criminal is.,,249,99,91,"*Disclaimer: This is my first post around here. I am not normally part of SRS


Hello everyone. 

Let's start out with saying that cheating is not a nice thing to do. If someone confesses to cheating on their spouses

However, blackmailing)* and there are mitigating circumstances. *(like being abused by your spouse).*

So naturally, and how to seek protection from the person blackmailing her.

JUST KIDDING. THIS IS REDDIT AFTER ALL.

To summarize: woman has her self-esteem destroyed by abusive husband. Seeks some comfort by chatting with a man who treats her nicely. Sends him naked pictures. She wants to end the thing. Man is now blackmailing her

**So obviously

- [Top comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o44s4) says she was cheating. How dare she not show nudes to her husband btw??? And how dare she threaten the HUSBANDS job by being blackmailed. It seems clear that he's the real victim. Expresses contempt by saying he would absolutely divorce someone like her. (+128)

- [This lovely comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o671x) is brave enough to call the woman a liar right away. She claims to be abused? Clearly a ""cop out"". She just wants to ""gain sympathy"". Continues to scold the woman for giving into the pressure of blackmail. ""You contacted him? Seriously?""  Calls a victim of abuse and blackmail **Childish and cowardly**. Keeps going on about the husbands rights and what HE deserves to know. (+58)


Okay


- [Here we go](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o58vw). In an abusive relationship and just looking for someone to treat you with decency? YOU are the bad person


Rarely has there ever been such a lack of empathy in one place. So far


- I can't even make fun of [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o654b). Verbatim: ""You cheated on your husband


- [This one also gloats over her misfortune](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o4kvo) saying ""Karma is a motherfucker"" and again blaming her for not sharing naked pictures with her abusive husband

- ""[woman up](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o4kvo)"" (+10)

- You are [dishonest and selfish](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o67ir) you silly victim. (+19)

- My own comment is still [in there](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o8vvg) but apparently wanting to help the woman to be stopped being blackmailed is [morally bankrupt](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o13j/im_30f_fearful_of_nude_photos_being_leaked_to_my/c6o996m) and direct quote

1334216060.0,s5v68,[META] SRS Survey 2.0 Results!,,305,154,128,"###The Results! They are here!

We had a staggering **1138** responses in the few days it was open

[The old survey results](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/nzipz/meta_srs_survey_results/)

*~Special Notice: The [SAWCSM Report](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/s5v68/meta_srs_survey_20_results/c4boqmg) is now available.~*

&amp;nbsp;

**[Age](http://i.imgur.com/Re0uH.png)**

Quite similar to the last time, slightly more SRSers are in the 18-22 group than in the 23 - 29 group (41% vs. 39%).

&amp;nbsp;

**[Gender Identity](http://i.imgur.com/GPfm2.png)**

Once again the results show a majority of SRSers are men, 2% as unsure or questioning, and 1% as no gender.

For the purposes of comparison (click for source; I've looked for the 2XC survey but can't find it again):

| | | | | 
:--|:--|:--|:--
&amp;nbsp; | r/SRS | [Reddit](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/09/who-in-world-is-reddit-results-are-in.html) | r/2XC
Male | 59% | 80.7% | 15%
Female | 32% | 18.7% | 80%
Other \* | 8% | - | 5%
No response | - | 0.614% | -
Number of responses | 1131 | 32 754 | 852

\*I included all of the other 4 options in the SRS survey and the ""Transwoman/Transman"" (these are the options taken directly from the 2XC survey) answers for the 2XC survey

A further **88%** of our users **identify as cisgender**

&amp;nbsp;

**[Sexual-Asexual Spectrum](http://i.imgur.com/93lhV.png)

Not surprisingly, 3% as asexual, and 5% as unsure or questioning. 

That links in very closely with the results for sexual and romantic orientation. As expected, pansexual (9%) and homosexual (8%). Romantic orientation is also broadly similar, with **55% identifying as heteroromantic**, followed by panromantic (11%), biromantic (8%), and homoromantic (7%).

Overall

(Sidenote: heteroromantic is a funny word. I think it's the ""roro"" in the middle. Heh.)

&amp;nbsp;



**[Race and Place of Residence](http://i.imgur.com/j6Vk5.png)**

NOTE: Yes I know the question is super problematic; if you've got ideas for improvements, not just in America. (And don't even get started on ethnicity...)

14% of SRSers do not identify as white, with 17% from Europe and 5% from Oceania - not that surprising, given that this is an English-speaking site.

&amp;nbsp;

**[Education](http://i.imgur.com/6badM.png)

The majority of SRSers have had **some college, and 12% have a graduate degree.

**68% of those surveyed identify as atheists**, so there goes the ""SRS is a fundamentalist Christian centre!"" accusation.

**51% of those surveyed are students**

&amp;nbsp;



**[Reddit use](http://i.imgur.com/O7ATO.png) and [SRS History](http://i.imgur.com/BpEa2.png)**

These graphs look like a bell curve

&amp;nbsp;

**[Finding SRS](http://i.imgur.com/yHOZE.png)**

Most of our users got here from **non-SRS subreddits ~~complaining~~ talking about us (24%)**. The next highest draw is our hard-working bot network

&amp;nbsp;

**[Favourite aspects of SRS](http://i.imgur.com/HWcNF.png)**

These were all pretty equal, respectively). This is very interesting, particularly as SRS's stated goal is to act as a massive circlejerk (52%, by the way.) 30 people were scrupulously honest, and admitted to trolling SRS. As for the ""other"" responses, many of them were along the lines of ""venting at shitlords"" or ""being taken seriously and not being dismissed out of hand"".

&amp;nbsp;

**Interest in [Activism, racial issues](http://i.imgur.com/vVZ5j.png), [class issues and environmental issues](http://i.imgur.com/4Uco0.png)**

Broadly speaking, GSM and class issues.** As these issues tend to be a focus in this sub, it's hardly surprising. We're not quite so concerned about the environment. For the most part SRSers are willing to engage in activism offline, with 56% of users choosing a 4 or a 5. 

&amp;nbsp;

**[Favourite Fempire subs](http://i.imgur.com/KOYR9.png)**

There were so many options

SRS's favourite non-r/SRS Fempire sub is **r/SRSDiscussion at 73%**, r/SRSGaming (33%) and r/daww (32%). This makes sense, since the majority of survey takers indicated that they liked the discussion aspects of SRS most. Interestingly enough, talking with SRSers in IRC and the mods of SRSD will give you a *very* different impression...

(I'm a bit surprised that r/daww didn't get as many votes. Everyone loves r/daww. EVERYONE.)

&amp;nbsp;

**[Patriarchy Smashing and DAGS OR CATZ?!](http://i.imgur.com/zJXul.png)**

Clearly

I am pleased to report that 95% of survey takers fully agree with smashing the patriarchy and/or the intersecting matrix of oppression

We also seem to have more cat lovers than dag lovers - but even more than that

&amp;nbsp;



The parting remarks were interesting. Its purpose was to act as a troll detector, I didn't have much to do.

They were incredibly heartwarming.

Really! So many of them were messages of support, or introducing different issues to them. Loads of people wrote - well, *essays* - about how SRS genuinely helped change them for the better. Mad propz to the person who wrote us a sonnet, which I shall now copy-paste verbatim (if you don't want it up, o anonymous poet, PM me and I will take it down ASAP):

    a glorious apparition is before me
    standing proud beneath a stormy sky
    i behold the most righteous gynocracy
    with my so unworthy eye

    beneath these skies lie a thousand redditors
    slain by our lady's splendiforous saints
    those stern and strict editors
    with their legions in war paints!

    but the battle-hardened grow weary
    and our hands tremble with this weight
    of a task that would leave us teary
    and so we see our storm abate.

    despite this it remains our true desire
    to see reddit as capable of something higher.

There were also some messages to tone down the moderation or the circlejerking

&amp;nbsp;

So what have we learned from the survey take two? That we're mostly comprised of men, pretty damn white, fairly young, mainly atheist, educated people, which considering that we're on Reddit, isn't at all a shock. But what's even more important is that all of these people are  presumably *not shitlords*. Reddit

I think that we can all agree that improving your self-esteem and becoming more confident is a clear net good.

Outer game techniques - which go beyond [simple flirtation](http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html) are often taught in a series of manual-like steps that read like the directions to the worksheets you used to do in third grade. Some PUA also focus on some aspects of [neuro-linguistic programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming) (called NLP) in the form of [patterns](http://www.pualingo.com/pua-definitions/pattern/) that

&gt; are combined to create a hypnotic autosuggestion in the target

The freakiest of these [patterns](http://www.fastseduction.com/guide/03_Approaching/11_The_Patterns/) is [The Door Pattern](http://www.fastseduction.com/guide/03_Approaching/11_The_Patterns/p_door.shtml). I just had to throw that last part in there to make sure that you read that shit. Seriously. If you read anything today

Understanding much of the Redditry in this post is dependent on understanding pick up artist lingo, SO YOU CAN'T DOWNVOTE THEM ANYWAY.

My wife died today of an unexpected complication from a longtime illness. She was a social worker (though she had been too disabled to work for a while) and a deep believer in social justice and if I ever said anything worth saying against hatred and bigotry there's a good chance it was because of her.

She wasn't a redditor

I don't know you guys that well but I really appreciate you and I just wanted to say we lost one of the good guys today

I have been letting people we know online know what happened

It all started one fateful morning on the fourteenth day of September, then witnesses a wheelchair user waiting outside. The redditor takes a picture and posts it on r/pics.

Now ignoring the obvious shittiness of the fact that the redditor decided to take a picture of the phenomenon of disabled people using the restroom instead of just, it didn't seem all that bad. 

But seeing as this is Reddit and the community are discussing disabled people

----

&gt; [""So I totally understand that disabled people require extra room to maneuver in a bathroom stall

Just like those parking spaces

&gt; ... sometimes they [the disabled] just can't wait.""

Why Are Black ""Leaders"" Anti Gun?

You all can guess where this is going!

&gt;Because if black people are self reliant

[+50](\http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/18b4b5/why_are_black_leaders_anti_gun/c8db9gr)

[+25](\http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/18b4b5/why_are_black_leaders_anti_gun/c8dbfuv)

&gt;Instead of ignoring the hate and focusing on the problems within the community themselves, engendering it in the community they are trying to lift up and creating a forum to advance the idea that self-reliance is unacceptable and hate is something to accept as truth.

Everyone at /r/relationship are experts in relationship and marital counseling and they can help you

Wait. Whoa. 

That's kind of a fucked up question to ask the Internet. Let's see what they say!

/r/relationships solved that conundrum for me. I am satsified that ""bitches"" are ""crazy"" and that any woman who was actually raped would go directly to the police station and report her rape before passing go or collecting $200! With all of my shitty personal beliefs confirmed

A lot can happen in 2 days, OOPSIE POOPSIE! But a few winners decide to hold out. People change! He was afraid to tell her the truth because she would judge him unfairly! She shouldn't be mad! How dare she attempt to get a restraining order? What about his inalienable gun rights? GOD, /r/relationships, WHY ARE YOU SUCH A HYPOCRITE? WHERE ARE YOUR IDEALS AND PRINCIPLES?

[But somethings just shouldn't be discussed in relationships. I don't tell girlfriends that I was sexually abused, etc. It's just not relevant anymore now. Your boyfriend is trying to leave that behind and start fresh and you are punishing him for an act over five years ago. I don't think that was fair at all. He didn't ever hurt you and it seems clear he's developed since. Perhaps I just empathize with the dark past concept.](http://i.imgur.com/8K8hh.png) - +4. He's *developed* since then? 

[He hasn't done anything to her yet or made any threats. She has no grounds for a restraining order. When you get a restraining order against someone it also removes some of their civil rights (such as the right to own a gun) so you can't put a restraining order on someone without cause.

Because

BECAUSE WE'RE ALL DYING TO SEE YOUR SWEATY NUTSACK AREN'T WE?

Now let's see what happens when a couple of redditors actually [make an effort (-23)](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1az7rr/swedish_feminists_call_for_all_men_to_be_banned/c928xgx) by [translating the article (-13)](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1az7rr/swedish_feminists_call_for_all_men_to_be_banned/c92ab5y) and posting it to the thread?

There is nothing legitimate

Yeah

* [""At any point while you were ""exposing subtle male oppression"" did you realize that you were also in fact collecting a website full of male crotch shots?
I think that aspect of all shows the incredibly transparent freudian view that feminists take of men. (ie I hate him but damn he sexy
I think it's time we expose female repression of men

To which one of the aforementioned redditors

* [""(quoting ""male crotch shots"" and ""I hate him but damn he sexy"") is pretty much supporting feminism

The entire thread is pretty poopy. On a happier note

Fun fact, some people value other things over how good of shape they're in. Sometimes they're writers, actors, scientists, counselors, IT people, inventors, or a whole slew of other things! My God! It seems like they can still be whatever they want.

The sense I get from r/fitness lately is that *fitness is the most important thing, but it shuts out people who might even want to get in shape. Their culture tells them that their body *defines* what they are, who they are, and what the world should think of them. This is an incredibly damaging viewpoint, frankly. Not every fat person is an awful person in the same way not every thin person is a good person.

___________________________

Once upon a time a beautiful female Reddit princess named theoculus posted [a thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ka3pd/i_was_sexually_assaulted_on_my_5th_day_living_in/) in TwoXChromosomes thread entitled [""I was sexually assaulted on my 5th day living in the city. [possibly triggering]""](http://i.imgur.com/AvGnc.png). The thread consisted of a [TW] [detailed description of theoculus being sexually assaulted](http://i.imgur.com/eqwbR.png). As is customary when someone tells a personal story in 2X, and speculate as to which school in Toronto she attended. All in all, the thread was relatively benign. 
_________________________

Shortly thereafter, the thread very quickly exploded in popularity. 

Now deleted user and fearless Internet detective

&gt; I really

&gt; I don't know why you would fabricate this story... but I don't know why someone would pretend to have cancer either.

&gt; Again

CUE. EPIC. SHITSTORM.

Bolstered by I_FRIENDZONE_CATS' reference to theoculus's use of zombie makeup

&gt; I'm not a doctor

&gt; The eye is a hard call, I would actually say that there is a strong possibility it is fake. the bruising is atypical of a single strike [...] she would likely have broken blood vessels in her eye, but it appears to be completely white. the area around the laceration is remarkably bruise free there is high level of bruising yet almost no visible swelling and most of all, the contusion stops very conveniently around her hair line and eyebrow. 

&gt; Like you I don't want to call fake if this is real. But some opinions, for any reason, ever claim fake rape are among the scum of the earth. Not only does it detract significance from actual rape cases, it can land innocent people in serious trouble. 3.) Possibly it is a bias due to my foreknowledge of her stage makeup expertise, but it REALLY looks like good makeup.

The opinion of a medical student pretending to be a forensic pathologist and of a guy named I_FRIENDZONE_CATS was all Reddit needed to make up its mind. Hopeful future Internet Detectives applying to The I_FRIENDZONE_CATS School of Internet Investigations, what the fuck? Anti-rape activist? *Really?*). The prevailing theory presented in the /r/reddit.com thread was that theoculus was an anti-rape activist who was using a fake story of an attempted rape to bolster her cause. The comments in these albums are now downvoted, but at the time of first posting, they were at the top of the /r/reddit.com thread: [Album 1](http://imgur.com/a/ZUa21), [Album 2](http://imgur.com/a/N830y).
_______________________________________

The evidence against theoculus was then culled together by Internet Detective stingerbell

&gt; ""She has anal sex - even though she doesn't want to""

&gt; ""She admits taking illegal (hallucinatory) drugs.""

&gt; ""She seems to like having sex in public:""

&gt; ""She likes being burned during sex."" 

Some people were impressed by the evidence
__________________________________________________________

The Internet Detectives in the /r/reddit.com thread quickly found the original 2X thread and informed 2X that they had been [faked out by a faker](http://i.imgur.com/3AfDD.png) leaving 2Xers [confused and upset](http://i.imgur.com/Eu9Rz.png).
