A year ago I was so so scared.  I didn't know how to do ANYTHING at our school. I didn't know how to use the online gradebook, the longer it would get.  I was going to bed at 8 and getting up at 6 just to make it through the day.  Most of all, I was constantly plagued by the question that my very soul longed to know the answer to, ""Can I do this?""  

Now, and it paid off.  All of my scores came out very average (3 out of 5, normal for a first year teacher).  I laughed, I cried, I became a woman.  Most of all though, I got an answer to that question, and the answer is YES.  I can do this.  I will do this.

Today I walked into that school butterfly free. I laughed and joked with old friends I hadn't seen in a while.  The kids will be here next week

I'm writing this as a word of encouragement from someone who has come out on the other side stronger and better.  The memory of year-ago me filled with doubts, so I wanted to give all of you first year teachers a virtual hug.  Please keep posting on /r/teachers because the least we can do is be there for each other.  

Everyone else too

Edit: Wow! Thanks for all the responses guys! It has been great to wake up and read all these comments!

1366684174.0,1cwqz9,Dear Teachers,studentawayyep,224,11,25,"Hi

___

I wasn't always in this system, mostly because I was gay and not very conservative-thinking like the rest of the students and teachers. I live in the deep South and it was difficult to not kill myself, but after 9th grade I decided I had enough of it. I transferred to my local public high school to see how things would go there. I live in the deep South, so I imagined it would be just as rough. My brother said I was possessed by the devil, so things weren't much better at home than at school. But things changed, because **teachers are fucking awesome.**

I met a teacher there who changed my life. He was Catholic, but if you are, I promise you - God doesn't hate you. You're not going to hell because you're gay. God loves you all the same. If you're not religious, then you don't have to worry about that. Don't give, you're almost out of this place. You're smart, don't let people who are ignorant win - they'll stay ignorant and you'll get stronger."" 

I was clinically depressed and spent nights writing him paragraphs upon paragraphs in emails when I couldn't sleep, patience, how to work hard, and how to cope with people who don't always like you, and that they don't matter.

They've taught me that money doesn't make a life worth living, I want to go to California for college. They've given me the drive and hope that I'll make it there, and they've kept me from dropping out and running from home, because things are literally that bad.

Anyways

TL;DR: **Whether you realize it or not, you can make a shitty situation at home into something that a kid can deal with. You can teach a kid something that his parents didn't care enough to teach him. You can make a kid feel like he's worth something. Teachers are the real heroes - thank you for everything you guys do.**

We had nothing to do with this. The kids organized this all within hours after school and took care of this themselves. It was amazing to watch these 12-14 yr olds be empowered in a way that was pretty mature and logical.

1371587343.0,1glwk0,Pearson seems to control everything in Education. Why are we not concerned?,Ms_Christine,142,13,54,"
Today

A quick look at Wikipedia tells me that Pearson PLC is a British publishing company out of London.  “It is the largest education company and the largest book publisher in the world.  It has three main branches: Pearson Education

I’d like to take a moment here to remind us of one of the biggest complaints we hear from students: the price of textbooks.  They’re expensive, we have the technology, resources, and willingness to deliver content in a much more open-source, community-centered manner through wikis and such- but we’re still using textbooks.  Hey, whose business is it to publish books?  And whose business is it to determine content?
Hmm.

Looking at their history, Inc.) and entered the educational assessment and school management systems market in the United states. …in 2003 it secured control of Edexcel”, which is the company that awards certifications and qualifications.   But wait, it can’t be that bad, can it?  Who awards teacher certifications?  

Let’s see, I couldn’t seem to find that information, but the Praxis exams which certify teachers in other states is published by the Educational Testing Service (ETS), which apparently is criticized for being a “highly competitive business operation that is as much multinational monopoly as nonprofit institution”.[38] Due to its legal status as a non-profit organization, ETS is exempt from paying federal corporate income tax on many, but not all, of its operations. Furthermore
“Beginning in January 2006, which is also responsible for scoring the SAT I “Writing” exam essay section.”

So Pearson is actively acquiring other certification/qualification exams.
(http://www.fairtest.org/ets-loses-sat-writing-test-contract )

Here’s what sparked this little investigation: I received an email from Commissioner King about the current goings on in NYSED and such.  At the bottom of the message
“On June 1

So if you don’t have an approved plan by May 29th, an invitation to field test the School Building Leader Assessment (SBL), which, when I go to the page (http://www.nystce.nesinc.com/fieldtest.asp )  , I find out is actually a New York State Teacher Certification Examination and- Oh no.  Oh no, oh no.  You can participate in this pilot test at Pearson Authorized Test Centers.  That can’t possibly mean that Pearson wrote the NYSTCE tests, can it?  But then

“The Evaluation Systems group of Pearson develops standards-based, and scoring and collaborates with state education agencies and teacher preparation programs to provide support for prospective teachers preparing to take the exams.” (http://www.pearsonvue.com/espilot/ )

Pearson awarded me my teaching certificate.  And I’ll be teaching with Pearson’s materials, does it?
But it does.  According to this article

Why is no one outraged at this?  Pearson has a monopoly- not a monopoly on goods, but a monopoly on minds.  They control what is taught, how it’s taught, what materials are used, and who teaches it.  Maybe there’s some wiggle room for style and personality, but in the end, we’re all playing by Pearson’s rules.

I’m horrified
Thoughts?  Reassurance that it’s not that bad?

I can almost guarantee you that had I have known some of these things (that perhaps you aren't taught in college) I would have had a much less stressful rookie year.
Please add on to the list everyone!

1.Come up with a simple method of grading homework (ex. don't grade every single problem...it will consume you.

2.Rubrics..Rubrics..Rubrics. At least have some method of grading or a model BEFORE students turn in their assignments. There is nothing worse than a pile of papers that have all veered in different directions and then you have to figure out what the hell to do. Rubrics give me the evidence I need to be able to sleep at night.
Don't bitch with others just because they are bitching...people complain A WHOLE LOT at school....if you join in you view the entire school as a negative environment...simply walk away.

3.Have a place to put extra copies of past work. When a student is absent they know where to get the copies...and you don't have to run around like a chicken with its head cut off because you can't find a copy/have to print one out...during class.

4.Understand that you can only help students that will accept it. If they aren't at least a little bit invested then there is little you can do to help them succeed. This does not mean give up on students

5.One night a week leave the building and all of your work at the sound of the bell (or when you can contractually leave). And also do not feel guilty about doing this...remember this is a job...a unique one...but still a job..and you cannot always be focused on it. You need to remember to relax and enjoy life if you are going to reach your potential in this career. 

6.On the night of parent conferences

7.Know what you want students to learn out of a lesson before you teach it...it avoids a boring lesson/waste of everyone's time.

Dear parents of elementary-school children

Here are some things you can do to make your child's teacher's life easier:

1. Write your child's name in or on everything she brings to school. This goes double if the school has uniforms

2. Return permission slips on time. You expect your son to turn in his homework on time

3. Read things teachers send to you. I know you get a lot of email; we do too. We hopefully try to send you as little as possible. That means that when we do send you something

4. Read your child's report card. Before I write a report

5. If you are upset with one of your child's teachers - over a report card, and makes that other teacher feel awkward.

6. If you are going to take your child out of school for a family trip, or the concert for one child. We also may not be able to put together ""a packet"" that will give your child the same learning experience he would have had if he had been at school for two weeks. (If we do put together work for your child to do on the trip, though, please help him find time to do it! It is extremely frustrating to spend two hours getting something ready at your request, only to hear upon your return that ""we didn't really have time."")

7. Let your children fail sometimes. Let them make mistakes. If your son leaves his homework until the last minute

8. Know that we love your children. We want what is best for them. We know that you do

Warmly

Today was her spring parent teacher conference. Her pre-algebra teacher explained those results to us. We know it's only one out of a slew of assessments

Students are encouraged to attend spring conferences, told her she was awesome, etc. Then I said to the teacher that he must be amazing too, because she'd never had results like that before. Apparently he's a pretty humble guy, because he immediately said it was all about my daughter. 

Now, who would argue with her dad and me when we tried to help her, who would sit at the kitchen table staring out the window and whining instead of just doing her homework. Somehow her teacher this year figured out how to connect her with math, how to interest her, how to show her that she really is good at it, how to encourage her.

I know he's not the only teacher of his kind out there, keep your heads up. Some of us out here understand how hard it is to do what you do, and we appreciate it.

Before coming to my school

I started out as a teacher substitute without a teacher education. Had to pay off some nasty bills, did something to me. I was hooked, so I started studying next to working. 100% work + 100% studies left me with 4-6 hours sleep every night for the past 4 years. My debt was over 40.000$, so in order to stay alive, I accepted all extra tasks for a little extra pay.
 
About 8 months ago (after working for 3 years), I'd bought an appartment, and all I needed was to get a little better pay, so my wife could quit her crappy waitress job and resume her studies too. I decided to do some off-hours work to pay my school back, so I wrote a couple of teaching books that were designed to help people with reading disabilities to learn how to use a computer. A publisher read them and wanted to publish. I turned him down, and gave them to the school. They eventually replaced the standard teaching books in some of the classes.

Background:  I have been working as a substitute for the last 3 years or so, formed bonds with the students, and received great recommendations from administrators.

This is a list of things that I do and that have worked for me.  I understand that everyone has their style and things that work for them. Please feel free to add your own suggestions.

* Try to learn as many students names as possible.  It creates a feeling of familiarity and respect between you and the students.  It is nice walking down the hallway and saying hello to students by name. 

* If possible get the lesson plans ahead of time.  The teachers appreciate you putting in the effort and if it is your subject area

* I bring my tablet with me and will plug it in to the speakers and play music for the students if they are just working on stuff or hanging out (homeroom
- occasionally I will play funny (and appropriate) youtube videos. (again class related

* Volunteer your help during your prep period.  I help out in the library and this helps me to recognize students

* Get to know the secretary.  This is who I talk to about scheduling the days I work. She has access to the sub system and can look up any openings before they are officially posted

* When it comes to discipline

* If students refuse to do work during class, that's fine. Then I will write it.""  Usually this will get them to take out their work and start doing something, but I have had some students opt for the note.  At this point it is out of my hands and their regular teacher can handle.  I also usually follow up with the teacher to find out how they dealt with the student.

This is all I have time to write right now. Sorry for the wall of text.  If you have any other questions

* Create a curriculum - give them a 'canned' curriculum that has been developed by a master teacher complete with assessments.
* Teach more than 2 preps
* Face classes larger than 25 - I know it seems backward
* Teach an AP class - the College Board recommends (requires?) teachers being 'certified' to teach AP classes by taking a 4 day workshop. Even IF a new teacher takes the workshop
* Be class sponsors - I'm sure it sounds like a good idea

1.  Be specific.  When asked about your classroom management strategies, please consider giving concrete examples.  Tell your interviewers about a particular lesson plan, activity or experience managing a rowdy crew.  We want to be able to picture you in a classroom, so the more details the better.

2.  Show your passion.  Passion for teaching and/or kids is not always something that can be learned, you will, likely, do so with gusto.

3.  Speak to how you can/will use technology in the classroom.  Nationally, study island, blended learning (to name a few) and be prepared to talk about how you might use them as part of your instruction or class management.

4.  When you get that pesky ""what are your strengths and weaknesses"" question, if your weakness is ""I tend to take a long time grading papers because I write so many comments"" then add ""but I have been looking at a variety of rubrics that I believe will allow me to grade as meaningfully in less time.""

5.  Mention what you would be willing to advise/coach/sponsor.  Most schools want teachers to be a part of their community, that sends the same message.  Bonus points if you are willing to advise something no one else seems to want to do, like the newspaper or SCA.  (On a personal note, that is how I got both of my jobs -- I was willing to advise the publications at my schools.  I don't do it anymore, but it got my foot in the door, despite never having touched design software.  If you are smarter than the average bear (and you are) you can figure out how to advise many clubs with a bit of help from the internet and colleagues).

I've been teaching for 10 years and sat on many an interview panel, so I thought I'd toss them out here.  I'm sure others have more suggestions and I hope they are added.  Good luck to all those out there still looking and have a great start to a new school year!",,False,,t5_2qqcs,False,,

Last May I was watching ""60 Minutes"" and their special on Kahn Academy and the Flipped Classroom. It was astounding to see this new theory and its application within the classroom. I was inspired to take Kahn Academy's ideas and adapt them to a Social Studies curriculum. I bought a $2.99 screen capture app on my Mac (there are free versions, but I was proud of the work I had put in. When the 2012-2013 school year came the environment in my classroom thrived and feedback from students and administration into my flipped classroom was better than I expected. Inspired by this feedback, I have created a second generation of videos for my classes as I move to a new school. These videos are for Ancient World History (Mesopotamia-The Middle Passage) and Sociology. These videos are more uniform, polished, detailed and professional. I am making these videos public and have put them on Youtube for other Social Studies teachers to use. I am not seeking money or notoriety, I only wish to help other teachers as other teachers have helped me. Our collective goal should be to help every one of our students reach their full potential, and to accomplish that we need to work together. Here is the link to my Youtube Channel.

I just graduated this spring with my degree in education, and I think it helped me tremendously in getting the position at my school.

1. Try to meet with your mentor teacher before the start of the semester, either agree to come earlier/stay later to sit down and get acquainted with each other.

2. LEARN YOUR STUDENT'S NAMES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. I really can't stress this one enough. Ask you mentor teacher if you can take attendance, thus making them more likely to behave during your instructional time. Besides, these kids have some really interesting stories! On a side note, if you can, go to their events and show your support. Students notice when you make the effort.

3. Don't be afraid to ask questions! Not just from your mentor teacher, even parents and other student teachers. I learned so much from just asking questions I felt kind of stupid asking, but getting acquainted with policies, procedures, software, etc. really helped me feel like a legitimate teacher.

4. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. If you have a good mentor teacher, as long as you are candid with them and own up to your mistakes, they are usually very understanding. Kind of a given with this one - don't be afraid to try something really different. Since you have that safety net, you can test it out before you get your own class.

5. Take notes! Especially when you see something you like, don't be afraid to audio or video record yourself teaching. It's quite eye-opening, and a great tool for reflection. 

6. Observe as many other teachers (in all subjects) as you can. You'll get so much more information about classroom setups, etc. A neat thing to observe is how one of your students may act in a different classroom.

7. Be prepared! Kind of a no-brainer

8. Get up in front of the class as much as you can. Exposure to teaching is the best way to really get comfortable. Make sure you have some time when your mentor teacher leaves the room. This will not only help you gain confidence

That is all I can think of at the moment. I know not every experience is going to be the same as mine; some mentor teachers may be more controlling, throw yourself out of your comfort zone and have fun! Remember, learning to teach is a slow process, you are going to get frustrated, there are going to be days when you want to cry, and there will be plenty of days where everything goes wrong or you simply don't know what to do. This is your time to work out those kinks.

So

When I was observing I noticed that the teachers kind of let the students do whatever they want. In one class I saw everyone race to the board during their bell ringer to put their name on it. I asked the teacher what it was for and she called it a bathroom list...everyone would ask to go every day so she made them get in a line. Does that seem weird? Why should the students leave the class every single day to go to the bathroom? Isn't that too much?

Also

I'm teaching science and when I observed labs the students just kind of walked around not doing anything. They didn't focus on their work.

I observed four classes and only one teacher seemed to have it under control. I asked her about her discipline plan but she couldn't really explain how she got them to act appropriately for class.

I feel like I'm rambling. I am incredibly nervous.


Tl;dr: I am teaching at a high school where the administration is not very involved in discipline. How can I create a classroom environment that encourages students to act appropriately and do their work? Are there any in-class consequences that work?

Today, but ""it didn't work out."" So I show up as a replacement to the boy's house for our 5:00 appointment. Ring the doorbell. Nobody's home. I wait a few minutes for the family to show up. Turns out the nanny took the boy to the playground and the mother and father won't be back until later. Okay, that's fine. I'm normally a chill person so I don't feel too upset about waiting for Harry and the nanny.


Finally Harry and the nanny show up at around 5:25. Before I can even begin the lesson


Now, I'M THE ONE WHO GOT PUNCHED IN THE FACE. I SHOULD BE THE ONE SCREAMING AND CRYING."" But I'm not this kid's mom and he obviously doesn't know any better. So I remain calm and tell Harry that he should apologize since hitting people is wrong. Nope. He crawls under the table and continues the classy act of screaming and crying (while throwing pencils at me). The nanny is smart and stays out of the whole mess.


Finally mom comes home and I tell her what happened. By this point, same deal. No reprimands, no apologies, nothing. I understand that parents these days avoid discipline for fear of upsetting their precious babies. But I’m pretty sure that children should be punished for PHYSICALLY ATTACKING STRANGERS.

1367522292.0,1dki1o,International Teaching: How to do it and why it is amazing.,MonmouthAldrich,49,8,27,"Hi Reddit. This is my first post and probably my last

Here is some background on my story. I graduated with a degree in History Education in December of 2009. I had a 3.97 GPA, England, Scotland, North Ireland and Greece. I did everything I could in college to make myself marketable because I knew finding a teaching job for history (or most other subjects besides math) would be very difficult. Unfortunately, it was not enough. For two years I jumped around school coming in mid-year to cover a teacher for a few months and never considered for a full time teaching position. The first time was because of budget cuts, the second was due to nepotism and the third was because I could not compete with much more experienced teachers who wanted to same jobs I did. I was frustrated and angry that I could not do what I loved to do without constantly being fearful of where or how long I would be working. I explained my frustrations to a friend at the gym who told me about International Teaching. Honestly I had never heard of it, but took her advice and was offered a job in Costa Rica. It was the best decision of my life. 

I wanted to let teachers who have been struggling to find jobs that there are schools that will give you the opportunity to do what you love

1) [Search Associates](http://www.searchassociates.com) -This is the company I would recommend. You have your own recruiter for your area and they try very hard to help you find a position. However the cost to join is about $250

2) [COIS](http://www.cois.org/) -This is a free company that is well known and has job fairs all over the world
*There are a few more

So

1) Sign up with one of the third party companies above. This may take a few days

2) Sign up for a teaching fair. These will be from the months of January to June and will be all over the world. For example, Bangkok, Hong Kong, South Africa and Maryland to name a few. The schools that will be attending will be listed on the site. The fairs last for 3 days (Friday, Saturday, Sunday). Book your plane ticket and hotel reservation (preferable the same hotel the job-fair will be at).

AND/OR

Look at the school the company has connections with. Pick a country or region of the world you want to go to and email the school of your intentions (regardless if they have vacancies or not). This will allow you to network and may get you an interview for a position even if no vacancies are posted (I was offered a job in Kuwait through this method).

3) Go to the fair. While going to the teaching fair make sure you have numerous copies of your resume

If this does not happen continue to email schools. My first international teaching position was offered to be in mid July

Here are the benefit packages all International School will give you:
-Health Insurance
-Free transportation to and from your point of origin in the summer
-Free furnished housing (depending on the school

Some school will offer:
-Stipends for graduate degrees
-Transportation for shopping
-Tax free salaries
-Housing and insurance for a spouse and dependents

The salaries for international school are varied but here are generally the salary trends:

-Latin America will pay between $17

-The Middle East will pay between $35

-African Countries will pay between $20

-European Countries will pay between $30, Switzerland and Austria.

-Asia schools will pay between $30

The best part is that these schools do not have unions, kids or no kids, secondary or elementary, young or old, anyone can do this. 

I will try to answer any relevant questions you have. I hope this post can help someone who is frustrated with the educational system in the United States to find a fulfilling

* You are not measured entirely by the knowledge, the test scores of your students and the impressions you make on your colleagues are the measure of your value.
* The people at the very top making decisions about your profession, and your principal has no power to advocate for you beyond his/her good word.
* Your work environment is predetermined by the social and economic conditions of your community, and the attitudes and struggles you encounter with your students will reflect it as well.
* You may encounter some very outspoken parents that believe you are part of a system out to enslave their children because people with no experience in teaching are telling them this is happening. The media these parents watch doesn't understand what your job is
* You may never know what it's like to live in any way other than from paycheck to paycheck. Even worse, since you're not measured by what you know or can do, your only hope may be winning that lottery of students that come into your classroom, score well on exams, and earn you a big bonus check. Talk about dangling a carrot... 
* Your Government is selling the education system to the huge corporations of the private sector in the form of charter schools and vouchers. The protections afforded to Teachers through labor unions are pretty much over

A Most-Important Edit:

* Teaching, doctors make medical decisions and supervisors of doctors cannot, in most cases at least, make medical decisions without a medical license; this is unethical, and the profession has influence over this circumstance. Attorneys technically cannot be supervised in their work by anyone who is not also an attorney; this is unethical, and the profession has influence over this circumstance. The US teaching profession is afforded no such influence. Our ""professional organization"" is the state government, mostly. The US Department of Education doesn't involve itself in local matters, professional educators in every state that can audit the classroom... not bureaucrats or consultants lacking ANY credentials in education.

- Don't collect anything until you are done. Collecting materials is a signal to your students that class is over.
- EYE CONTACT.
- Shouting to be heard above them just makes them shout to be heard above you. Attentive silence is so much more effective. Add eye contact for best results.
- It's ok to use humor. It's ok to use sarcasm. It's not ok to be mean.
- Condescention builds resentment. 
- A loud classroom is not necessarily a bad classroom. Use your authority to channel that noise into something constructive.
- Don't make threats unless you plan on following through.
- Avoid writing referrals, unless it's gotten to the point where that is necessary. Deal with problems IN THE CLASSROOM. If you defer your disciplinary authority to others then you will be treated accordingly.

1331082999.0,qkzza,Hopefully this is the place for this: I've decided to quit teaching.,CannotTeachAnymore,34,7,26,"I'll be the first to admit I'm not sure what I hope to achieve by writing this. I just can't deal with it anymore and I thought there might be others with similiar experiences. Or maybe I just need to bitch.

I've been teaching for almost seven years. I cut my teeth as a graduate teaching assistant teaching a few sections of freshman speech, although there have been a number of exceptions. Since it is a speech class, one of the core requirements for all state universities here, an overwhelming majority of my students do not want to be in this class at all.

So yes, I'd go back to college, earn a terminal degree, and become a full professor in a field I'm more passionate about.

But something happened a year ago. I realized that I just don't have the patience for this. It's not the students who struggle, but they are challenges I can handle. I have the patience for them. Even the students who are just horribly irresponsible who don't adequately complete assignments--assuming they complete them at all--don't bother me *that* much. These are all hazards of the job that I've learned to expect.

It's the entitled students that drive me nuts. The ones who don't complete the assignments or do a very poor job of it, and the broken hearts, and the general feeling that I've got to be the bad guy so frequently.

I'm tired of working my ass off on improving my course to make the material and requirements more clear, and tell me that they didn't even bother to read the justification I spent that time writing.

I'm tired of society treating teachers, mostly). I'm tired of hearing about how teachers are slackers who don't deserve their already meager salary and benefits.

I can't deal with this shit anymore. I got into this career because I care about education. I still care about education. But I don't have the patience to deal with the inattentive, but...it's just become apparent that I can't continue being an educator anymore.

Sorry for the long post. In closing, I feel like I've let the rest of the teachers in this world down by giving up, but I guess we're not all cut out for this job.

My plan is to set up a small computer and projector in a classroom in rural areas of South Africa where children have extremely limited access to good quality teachers.

Because of severe bandwidth limitations, along with a virtual blackboard to allow the teacher to scribble and illustrate, and have it projected for the students in real-time.

With this in mind


1. Do you think it would be worth delivering a lesson if the children don't have access to anything but your voice and your blackboard? That means no textbook
2. Do you think that teachers would donate their time towards this? I am acutely aware that everybody's time is precious so I please be honest.

It's a typical urban school and they have trouble finding teachers who will stay. It has been a hard transition for the kids because the school had them in 3 large classes. I was hired to make class sizes smaller. This means I'm coming in halfway through the year and making everything change.

Besides the obvious classroom management issues I'm working through (students shouting out, etc), I'm also dealing with lots of sex notes I keep finding 3 of my kids writing. I have followed the school's procedure of sending the notes to the office, keeping a record of the offense, and sending the notes home, but I feel like something else might need to be done.

These notes are more than the typical ""Do you like me? Check yes or no."" I'll post a few that are pretty typical:

* ""Will you have sex with me? Check yes or no.""
* ""I want to stick my dick in your ass""
* ""When can I fuck you hard?""

I have been catching the note writing more frequently as I find out how they try to hide it. I realize children are curious about the human body and relations with each other. This just seems like it goes way too far. I feel like I should be concerned about sexual abuse at home or something. Is this type of behavior something I should be concerned about?

Help?",studentteacherissues,35,66, he is planning and grading exclusively) have been some challenging classes in that they involve many students with IEPs. I have very high expectations for him because I want my students to be learning. That said

1. There isn't much of a clear established objective for each lesson. I've asked him to write objectives on the board for me to know what the students should have gotten out of the lesson. The one he has written has been somewhat vague and hasn't changed in 2 weeks. I also spoke with him about having more of a clear agenda on the board for the day for me and for the students, but I've gone over the concept of objectives with him before and given him ideas of how I structure the class period every day when we are reading a novel. Some of that, he's taken, but not all of it.

2. The class is somewhat disorganized and he isn't asserting his authority the best that he could. He tells students how they should behave but doesn't give consequences for if they do not behave this way. The students seem to like him, one student moved from his assigned seat today to a seat by his friends. He went and asked him to move back, but the student didn't, and there did not seem to be a consequence for not following instructions. He does not seem to be a very authoritative person, though he tries, he seems somewhat timid with the students when it comes to redirecting them. He is fine talking to them about their interests, etc.

3. I don't think some of the grades he is giving the students reflect their performance. I noticed he gave most students As or Bs on the essay he graded, I want their grades to accurately reflect their ability to write at grade level.

I think he is concerned too much with the students liking him and this translates to shaky classroom management. He is afraid that the students will not like him. When I bring these issues up with him he gets somewhat defensive. I think I try to keep it positive, I am trying to tell myself that he needs to make his own mistakes. I don't think he is willing to be 100% honest with me about my criticism for obvious reasons, so do you think I am being reasonable? We have two different personality types, so it's difficult for me to compare his experience to my own - I was always asking how I could improve when I was student teaching and he doesn't often do so.

Homework completion has been on my mind a lot lately because I'm starting in a district where I know many students will not be getting much support at home (many of our parents work multiple jobs). This is a factor which I know contributes to a decline in homework completion. I have an idea of what I might want to do

Students are given a packet every Monday with their homework for the week (all content created by me, they must fill out the Missing Assignment Tracker in homework section of binder, which asks for a brief explanation of why they did not complete their homework and will be shown as evidence to parents if homework completion is a continued problem. The reason I think this might be a good idea is that it gives students multiple days to complete the homework. Many of my students help out at home, and so it may be that they just didn't have the time on Tuesday night to finish the assignment due Wednesday. Also, I feel that remembering to turn in one packet every Friday is far easier than keeping track of which days certain things are due. I plan to keep the packets more general, based off the wider standards rather than a task that must necessarily follow the classroom activity, just in case students decide to work ahead in the packet. 

What does everyone think of this idea? Has anyone else done something similar and can help me catch some of the flaws before I bring it into the classroom?

He also doesn't keep me in the loop on what's going on. I rarely know what he is doing each day with his classes ahead of time unless I specifically ask. I'm not sure if I should, to the point where I feel like I have to tell him everything. For example, the other day almost all the students were sitting wherever they wanted and not following the seating chart, and he didn't even really seem to notice or be proactive with the situation until I mentioned it to him.

Before break started, I am really worried about whether this will reflect on me. I told him he should have let me know about this, but he hasn't said anything back, which makes me think I made a big deal out of something that shouldn't be. Not to mention, the same day, he said he was coming in to enter grades when I would be there to let him in, and then texted saying he would be there an hour after I said I was going to leave.

I am really not looking forward to going back to work. I feel like it's more work than anything to have someone else teaching your classes. I am losing motivation in trying to be positive, but I also feel like I've had these expectations and few of them have really been met. It's been hard to even enjoy my Spring Break.

My students are sweet but unmotivated. Most of them have spent their lives hovering just above or below the poverty line. These are kids who work jobs to make ends meet, that you need a diploma to get a job. Some even grasp that a bachelor's degree has become the new standard for most employment. But for the majority of them, school is something you simply get through. If you show up and do the ""work"", you will pass. But the new English standards demand more than a passive understanding of subject matter. They are, arguably, the best standards we've had in the sense that they require students to actually understand how to read and write. These standards will be tested using an assessment which include items that are not multiple choice. Even the multiple choice items will be more rigorous. They will require students to use critical thinking to unpack the meaning of the question before they can attempt to answer it. Many will assess two or more standards at a time. My current students have spent their entire educational life acclimating to the old standards. They are used to fill in the blank notes and multiple choice everything. They are happiest taking down notes in silence while someone at the front of the room talks and talks about they know not what. Fed on a steady diet of images from the time they possess the ability to speak, their minds are simultaneously over-stimulated and underfed.

* I'm a male student teacher
* I've primarily interned in 5th grade
* I love working with kids
* I've thoroughly enjoyed my time as a student teacher 
* I'm getting my degree in Elementary Education and will be certified for K-6 general education

So, I do wish I followed my passion instead of taking the ""safe"" route). Throughout the past two years, I've had reservations about continuing as a general ed elementary teacher in public schools. Suffice it to say, I DO NOT WANT to be a teacher at this point. I loved my time as a student teacher and love the kids in my 5th grade class. I often get those ""warm and fuzzies"" that make me think this job is worth it, but ultimately I've decided that those feeling aren't enough to make all the extra bullshit worth it. 

I love teaching the kids and them having ""ah-ha"" moments as well as connecting to them and being a positive role model. I LOVE that part of the job. 

What I HATE is the extensive planning, and all the extra bullshit (ie - committees, dealing with parents, type-a bitches surrounding me, etc etc). 

It's weird because I knew about all of this shit when I started the teaching program, I just know this isn't for me. If it comes down to it, and a teaching position is the only thing available, i'll take it over a fast-food career, but if I can help it at all, I want to avoid the general teaching position (especially public schools) at all costs. 

SO, I was just wondering if anyone here had the same feelings at the end of their student teaching and what did you do. Any information would be greatly appreciated. 

TL;DR - I'm done student teaching and don't want to be a general education teacher. What other options do I have?

RULE ONE: Find a place you trust

RULE TWO: General duties of a student — pull everything out of your teacher; pull everything out of your fellow students.

RULE THREE: General duties of a teacher — pull everything out of your students.

RULE FOUR: Consider everything an experiment.

RULE FIVE: Be self-disciplined — this means finding someone wise or smart and choosing to follow them. To be disciplined is to follow in a good way. To be self-disciplined is to follow in a better way.

RULE SIX: Nothing is a mistake. There’s no win and no fail

RULE SEVEN: The only rule is work. If you work it will lead to something. It’s the people who do all of the work all of the time who eventually catch on to things.

RULE EIGHT: Don’t try to create and analyze at the same time. They’re different processes.

RULE NINE: Be happy whenever you can manage it. Enjoy yourself. It’s lighter than you think.

RULE TEN: “We’re breaking all the rules. Even our own rules. And how do we do that? By leaving plenty of room for X quantities.” (John Cage)

I grew up in a Montessori schooling environment, fractions in first grade, root-finding algorithms in 2nd-3rd, just to get an idea). I grew into math competitions, and I'm a math undergrad right now. Most of my tutoring experience has been at the high-school level, where I can freshly recall most of the material and a quick read reminds me of what the important ideas to convey are.

But I've got a recent case that's giving me trouble. I got convinced to tutor a family friend's struggling 11 year old. Really bright kid, and her grades have gone from 50s to mid-70s. She has no problems with concepts and problem solving, but (let's not mince words) she absolutely cannot do arithmetic that I'd expect even a kindergarten child to breeze through. Manipulating single-digit numbers, being able to break down common numbers (recognizing that 100 = 2x50 = 4x25 = 5x20 = 10x10, for example), sanity-checking answers (multiplying something by 5 should give you an answer ending in 0 or 5), etc.

&gt;So for the most part, and does this thing where he sticks he tongue out at me and wiggles it…he says it looks like something a devil would do, lovely.Today during math, we were learning about angles, and measuring angles, and drawing angles, and estimating the measurement of an angle by looking at it.  I helped him a lot because his motor skills aren’t
&gt;really all there, and it seemed to work.
&gt;After the kids had finished working on their workbook page, thinking about football, or bay blades, or how long until gym class.  Sometimes I make him admit to it too, haha.  And if he does have something to say, he rarely raises his hand.  Sometimes he will, but if he is not called on first, and says it is not worth it to sit there and wait to be called on.
&gt;
&gt;Today he raised his hand…and not in a lame way.  His hand was straight in the air.  And kept it raised while 2 people explained their tips. Thankfully, cleared his throat, and began to eloquently explain some of the things that I worked on with him.
&gt;
&gt;When he normally speaks in class
&gt;
&gt;He demonstrated angles by using his hands…and talked about how right angles look like the letter L. “If you put your hands together like this (wrist to wrist, that is an acute angle. And if you open them up wide, that is an “abuse” angle.  UGHHH, I cannot pronounce that word!!!!    And straight lines, are, well, straight.  So you put your hands like this.  And then if you make an angle bigger, not realizing no one could see it but him*.  Well, because at least I know it is less than 90 degrees….” (I was teary by this time.)
&gt;
&gt;The teacher attempted to respond…”Very good!  Boys and girls
&gt;
&gt;But he cuts in to go into further detail
&gt;
&gt;I helped him finalize his words, basically, you know, you will get an A on the test!”
&gt;
&gt;And then he put his hand down, except it was, because he was 110% accurate.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;And he had the attention on every single kid in the room.  Because when he speaks for real–and isn’t trying to be the funny guy—he commands the room in a natural way.And after this, because in my opinion, that moment was worth every time I have had to tell him to raise his hand, sit up straight, hold his pencil the right way, pay attention, write this down, writer neater, make a better choice, stop calling me by my first name
&gt;And that is why I teach.  Because nothing beats the feeling of one of your kids having a ‘light bulb moment’…where for just one moment, because that is what we have been working towards for the past five and a half months.  And it is just enough to make you want to tackle the next obstacle the next day.  And for me, apparently it is enough to make me want to cry, because I am emotional like that.  I call it the light bulb effect.

2.	Do you feel as though you aren’t appreciated for your work? Do you feel as though you have no control over what goes on in the school?

3.	How involved are you in the school? Do you try to get to know the students or do you tend to separate yourself from work as much as possible? Do you feel as though it has to do with your gender or the grade you teach?

4.	Do you tend to treat your students differently based on their race or socioeconomic background? (E.g. you’re more willing to help one student over another) If not

5.	The US is ranked 17th in education among developed nations. How can we improve our education system?

6.	I’m not sure about other states

7.	Are you part of a teacher’s union? Do you feel as though it has done a sufficient job in representing you opinion as a collective whole and protecting your rights?

8.	I know teaching can be a really stressful job. What are the factors that stress you out the most? (E.g. Disruptive students

9.	Do you have enough job satisfaction that you could see yourself teaching long term? Do you ever feel yourself burning out or have you seen a colleague burn out?

* Lend a hand to other teachers if you’re not busy.
* Investigate classroom management strategies and find out which one works for you.
* Carry a folder of back-up games and activities.
* Don’t be afraid to ask for help.


**Pre-class**

* Get to the school early – if it’s going to be a place you want a regular gig
* Find out the names of the year level coordinators and the teachers you are subbing for.
* Get a copy of the school guidelines policy (attendance, class times and emergency procedures).
* Get a map of the school.
* Collect passwords for (1) classroom PCs (2) any software you need to log in to and (3) the photocopier
* Have a go-to plan in place to manage any rare crisis or major event.
* Is there a photo sheet of the class available? If not
* Collect and understand the absent teacher’s lesson material.
* If there is no lesson material available


**Start of class**

* Sub’s name and three single word guidelines on board:

1. Respect (I have respect for you
2. Responsibility (you are responsible for your own learning and behaviour.)
3. Routine (normal classroom rules apply

* Tell students that they should do the work assigned
* Write down the activities the students are doing on the board so they don’t have an excuse to lose focus.
* Don’t be a hard-arse or a pushover.


**Classroom management**

* Establish a routine (like a raised hand) to indicate when you need silence.
* Learn as many names as the situation allows. (This may involve marking them on a seating chart as you take roll.)
* Never shout or lose your temper.
* Respond warmly to positive interactions and coolly to negative interactions.
* As a motivator
* Praise in public
* If you raise your voice slightly for momentary control
* Have an established order of discipline escalation
* Own the classroom. Walk and talk when necessary
* Consistency: follow through with the consequences that students earn via negative behaviour.
* Discipline with ‘what’ questions rather than with more confrontational/blaming ‘why’ questions.
* The old maxim: “kids don't care what you know until they know that you care.” Of course
* Remember that group work can tricky for a substitute teacher to manage. Use it as a carrot (“I think you’re responsible enough to handle working in pairs/small groups” or a stick “I need to see that you can work quietly by yourselves before I let you work in pairs/groups.”)


**Post-class**

* Make sure the classroom is left in proper shape for the next class.
* Leave the regular teacher some notes indicating what occurred during the class, and anything unusual you may have noticed.

OK. I've had it up to here with talk of education reform in America. In my opinion

Let's begin by making a mental picture of what an ideal school day would be like. A child arrives to school (I'm going to use a male as an example), intellectually stimulated by his home life, homework completed, self-esteem elevated by positive interactions at home, pre-frontal cortex allowed to function because he doesn't feel threatened, and in an environment that promotes a sense of calm and well-being.

Let's be honest, busywork would become a thing of the past, and classroom management would become much, much easier. Education could happen.

Let's consider what teachers across the nation tend to face. A kid comes to school not having had breakfast, fearful of so many things, and clawing at self-worth by any means necessary. In an attempt to force the second child to act like the first child, we institute school reforms. We provide free food for kids, but the cost requires that we default to the lowest common nutritional denominator, so kids get sugar for breakfast.

Kids come to school unable to read, read, sing, move, and share their curricula in multimodal ways. Kids come to school feeling unsafe, so we mandate that schools reduce problem behavior without addressing the underlying causes of said behavior. Large infractions are treated harshly while the smaller infractions causing the larger ones are ignored.

A more rigorous curriculum is a great thing, it's just school reform.

Real

tl;dr What people call education reform is largely just school reform. Education reform must occur from outside the school walls.

Hey /r/teachers

I am currently doing a combination of tutoring and volunteering in an elementary school. The goal is to gain experience that will benefit me once I commence my Master's in Education. For the past three months I have been limited to observing the kids and running an after school tutoring group.

This quarter i received a larger group of students, during our first session together, she decided that the point system to determine rewards was unfair, and opted to not participate for the majority of the session. I ignored her and kept the rest of the kids on track, and occasionally asked her if she wanted to rejoin the group, each time receiving a negative response.

Toward the end of the hour she came over and started interacting with her peers in a way that was interfering with their ability to work. I told her to leave the classroom and go to the cafeteria

This caused her to melt down into tears. This was followed by her throwing a pencil in my direction, and felt that the impediment of the desk between us was emboldening her behavior. So I pulled her desk and chair out of the way and stood about 2 feet away from her, instructed her to leave in a scolding tone (which I just learned that I had), and then asked her why she wasn't leaving. This resulted in her sitting down, arms crossed, crying, at which point I told her that if she could remain quiet she could remain.

As the hour was wrapping up I sent the other kids back to cafeteria to be dismissed, consequently, no candy. We went back and forth on this for a minute, and then I called it as our time was up.

As we were leaving the classroom, as she was now in actual trouble. In this state of tears, I walked her back to the cafeteria where her father was waiting for her. I calmly introduced myself to him, explained the events that led to his daughter in tears and hugging his legs, and told him that I was looking forward to having a better day tomorrow. 

We all left after that. On the drive home, where I will see this child, I have felt like hell for disciplining this kid. It was the first time that something like this had happened, and it caught me by surprised in terms of how fast things escalated. 

My questions for you all are as follows:

1. How do you come back

2. Is it normal to feel really bad the first this happens? Will it get easier to be the disciplinarian? 

3. Finally

Thanks!

I just don't want to be blamed for the student's failings.  

For background, teaching 6th grade.  

I know kids say all the time ""No one ever taught me that"", but chances are it was taught.  I have looped (taught 4th then the same kids 5th, or 5th to 6th), and they STILL claim I didn't teach them something the year before, even though I know I not only taught it, but we worked with a concept extensively and I assessed for mastery.  

Students also continue to hold on to odd ideas that someone said once in passing or a well-intended teacher/tutor/parent said to them.  I cannot count how many times I have been asked how many sentences are required for an assignment (my answer is always ""as many as it takes"") or how often I am told that FIVE sentences make a paragraph.  Students hold on to these ideas and they stick and it is very hard to get around them. 

Granted, Korean, Arabic..) but also have intensive English lessons - which are notoriously bad (talk about formulaic writing - they all sound exactly the same). 

We, sure, your students will not come with a deep understanding of some mathematical or scientific concept - or their memory of what American history was will be spotty at best.  I know that I cover the standards - I look at what my state (and soon Common Core) says kids need to know and make sure that we teach to that.  I also have limited knowledge in some areas - certainly a better understanding that what is required of my students, but I don't have a BA or BS in Science, Mathematics, History or English - Most of us have a general subject degree (liberal studies, for instance) or some other subject area and have shown proficiency in the general areas by assessment (psychology, child development).   We are doing our best

And what you say about us often comes back to us.  My former students stop by all the time.  They tell me that their teachers say we didn't prepare them, especially to the students.  This degrades all of us.  And, yes, I take what these kids say with a grain of salt, due to the 'we never heard that before' phenomenon.  

I hope this provides a bit of perspective.  I feel better having said this...  Thank you for listening.

If you were to say you’re a firefighter, lawyer, or many other professions people automatically respect and appreciate you and what you do.  But teachers are bombarded with questions and comments, which baffles me.  Teachers in America do not get the respect and appreciation they deserve.  They put in more time and effort to educate the future leaders of this country. They impact and lay a foundation for many students each and every day.  Teachers are held at a very high standard, as they should be, but in order as a society to hold them at that standard we need to respect and show them we appreciate everything they do.   

There are plenty of bad teachers but they are also plenty of good, they will always be a teacher in the headlines for doing something ill-advised but there aren't enough teachers making headlines for all the great stuff they do.  

So, challenge, and friendships we developed I would not be where I am today. That includes each and every one of you from Ms. Mitchell in Vandenberg Air Force Base, CA to Ms. Dina in Aurora, CO.  To all the great teachers out there I thank you on behalf of a society that’s not quite there.

1355717731.0,14z680,My humble contribution of teacher tips,davidpm,17,3,8,"I’m reading tons of posts on here that really take me back to when I started teaching.  I went through so many of the same experiences.  I’ve really enjoyed passing along the things that I’ve learned over my time teaching and I wanted to see if I could think of all of the little things that I’ve done over the years to make my job easier and pass them along in one comprehensive post.  I’m also willing to help out with any specific questions or problems you might have.  

Quick background:  I’ve been teaching for the past 6 years.  I teach secondary math.  I’ve taught in one of the most crime ridden, in an urban charter school, and most recently, in a pretty well-to-do suburban high school.  I’m a 31 year old male and I’ve done all of my teaching in NYC and NJ.  I started teaching via an alternative certification program.  

**Grading:**  
•  I currently grade on a point system.  All of my previous schools have required a weighted average system (for example, it’s easy to see how they each relatively impact their grade.

•I only collect and grade what is absolutely necessary.  This means big projects and quizzes or tests.  I don’t collect homework or classwork

•	I don’t give a grade for class participation or classwork because these are not easily quantifiable things.  When I did do this

•	When I make quizzes and tests

[Example
](http://imgur.com/4Lqs8)

•	I always give my students the opportunity to make up work.  Even if they only get 1 out of 4 for late homework assignments, they have bad days, they have days where there are 5 tests and they might not be prepared.  They have to come to one extra help session to review what went wrong on the last quiz and I give them a reassessment that covers the same topic but with different questions (this should be pre-prepared – make two tests for each assessment.  This also lets you give back quizzes before absent students have taken it.  The absent students just get the reassessment.)


**Classroom management/discipline:**

•	Your best tool for managing your classroom and minimizing discipline issues is to keep your students busy at all times.  The moment that they walk into your classroom, I don’t check it and it’s a zero.  I usually have several students that are working before the bell even rings.  

•	Consider every reason that I student has to get out of their seat and have a procedure to minimize or eliminate that reason.  The most common ones are pencil sharpener, and bathroom.  I keep a box of presharpened pencils in my bag.  If a student needs a sharp pencil, they just hold up their pencil in the air and I grab one from my box and trade it for their dull one.  I then sharpen the collected pencils once every few weeks.  I tell my students that if they have trash, to just leave it on the corner of their desk and put it in the garbage at the end of the period.  If I happen to notice it while I’m circulating, I grab it and throw it out myself.  I try to put my tissue box in the least distracting place in the room and just ask my students to ask for permission before getting up to use it.  For the bathroom, I keep a prewritten pass by the door.  I ask my students to raise their hand with their thumb between their index and middle finger.  I can point them towards the door without stopping my lesson.  I’ve always hated when students raise their hand in the middle of teaching and ask for the bathroom, so this procedure minimizes distractions.  

**Instruction:**

•	Don’t lecture for too long.  Each little bite of material should be no longer than 10 minutes, so circulating gives these students the opportunity to ask questions.  

•	Independent work shouldn’t last for longer than 20 minutes.  

•	Convey your passion for your subject in your lesson delivery.  Students notice.

•	Always over prepare.  Have more copies of a worksheet then you think you need

•	I use SMART software and post my notes online as a PDF with the homework assignment for each lesson as well the digital version of any handouts  (My algebra class is at [www.chalgebra.info](www.chalgebra.info) if you want to check it out)   This lets students who are absent

•       Use your competent colleagues as a resource.  There are 3-5 other teachers that teach the same subject as I do.  We split up the tasks - Someone will make the homework worksheet, etc.  No sense in 5 people doing the same work when you can share and tweak it to your style.  

•     Dress one level more formal than your students.  If it's a uniform school, I ALWAYS wear comfortable shoes.  You're on your feet a lot.  I stick with all black sneakers.

**Administrative tasks:**

•	I keep all of my attendance on jupitergrades.com instead of doing so on paper.  You can print out your roll if your administrator needs it and you can take your attendance in seating chart view instead of alphabetical

•	I also print out[ the seating charts and use them to check homework](http://imgur.com/1KRBO) – again, I put on A in the box so that I can remind them the day that they come back.  If they were absent on the day that the assignment was given but present on the check day, I put ALC (absent last class) in the box.  It works really well.  

 
•       I enter homework on the school’s online gradebook immediately after I check it.  My students are finishing their warmup and I’m waiting anyway.  It takes about 2 minutes to fill in numbers to 20 boxes.  Parents appreciate the immediate feedback and you have one less task piling up.

**Recipe: No-Knead Bread**

Adapted from Jim Lahey

Time: About 1 1⁄2 hours plus 14 to 20 hours’ rising
3 cups all-purpose or bread flour

1⁄4 teaspoon 

instant yeast 

1 1⁄4 teaspoons salt 

Cornmeal or wheat bran as needed.


1. In a large bowl combine flour, preferably about 18, at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees.


2. Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes.


3. Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, wheat bran or cornmeal; put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.


4. At least a half-hour before dough is ready, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. I use a Dutch oven I got at a garage sale. IT WILL BE VERY HOT. HOT THINGS CAN HURT YOU. BE CAREFUL. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is O.K. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.
Yield: One 1 1⁄2-pound loaf.

The first day was a couple of weeks ago and went pretty smoothly. Then we had a day off for the 4th, there has been a downfall in behavior in the classroom. We had one new student added who can be passive aggressive towards his classmates and have trouble controlling his emotions. No surprise, he has an Emotional Disorder. Obviously this behavior is unacceptable and unfortunately has become common for him and now some of his classmates. Like I said, this mix was a very volatile one. I immediately took my concerns to the principal and lead teachers. They gave me ideas such as a tickets reward system and a prize for good behavior each day. I implemented pretty much everything they told me to do. But it has gone nowhere. Everyday we seem to have bullying or conflicts between the students, and I get burned out each day trying to keep the peace.

It is in a way in response to a debate that opened up in another thread. Please understand that these are just my opinions. and Please feel free to agree or disagree with me.*

Over the last few weeks I have been bombarded with questions about why I feel that English is an important subject.

After much debate on a particular post

Several people posting asked about why we teach English and not technical writing

**Technical writing** – Technical writing may not be covered in depth, Essays actively help students develop their ability to write coherently and correctly. Yes it may not be as technical as other subjects demand, but if it wasn't for studying English in the first place we would not be able to write effective and cohesive arguments in a technical essay based manner.

**Public Speaking** – Public speaking

**Critical Reading** – Now this is the one point where I will concede slightly. In English at school level we are taught to read analytically to a certain extent, that critical reading can be classed as different for every subject we look at. It will be different in Maths, Science and even Physical Education. However the base we are given in our English studies prepares us for the critical reading we will do at later stages and gives us the basic understanding of how to dissect and analyse a text at a basic level.

TL;DR
English can be seen as an important subject because at a basic level it does in fact teach Technical Writing,False,,t5_2qqcs,False,,,t3_15tn91

So, I've never been let go, nor had a negative observation, but nothing has gotten any easier either. This year I am working at a charter school where I am responsible for creating a lot of the curriculum myself, and between time spent at work, and time spent at home grading, planning and designing materials

I am thankful to be employed right now in this economy, have hobbies/interests, but right now I feel like I have time for none of those things. Everyday I get off work at 4 or 5 depending on the day, and then feel like I have 2-3 hours of work ahead of me. Weekends are a little better, but still a lot of my time is taken up grading, planning and making materials. I know that I could probably switch to another site where conditions might be better, but I am thinking of leaving education altogether.

I am still having trouble passing the math portion on the general knowledge test and at times I really doubt that I may be knowledgeable enough to educate others.

What if a future student comes for help in subject I am certified in, and I have no idea how to explain it to the student? Also I'm thinking about getting my Master's in either Educational Technology or Educational Leadership.

Regardless, but I'm ready to move on.

The gist of our system is that you qualify for points based on criteria like number of failing grades given to students, and scores earned on a self-evaluation. There's also a school-wide component that is obviously outside of an individual teacher's control. No one knows how everything is weighted, but there's a $25,000 pot that is divvied up based on how many points are awarded across the entire district. The more teachers that apply, the less everyone gets. 

Last year I didn't even bother looking at the application because I assumed it was a waste of time (most of the teachers in the high school shared a similar sentiment). This year

Today I found out that as a result of all of my hard work I was awarded $250 as my 'bonus.' I honestly had no idea what to expect

I started at an arts-focused high school 4.5 weeks ago. There are roughly 75 students enrolled and on a good day, etc.) as well as IEPs (ADD and ASD run very high; about 80% of them have IEPs).

My history is with arts magnet schools, lots of writing, and a lot of in-class discussion. I have very high expectations from my students. This school and these students are no exception.

I have assigned reading for my classes. I'm an English teacher

About 10% of my students complete the homework. Quiz scores are abysmal even when I do everything I can to prepare them. I do not surprise them with assignments (I give them calendars and write everything on the whiteboard for the entire week).

I went to the principal about this today. I asked if it was a school-wide problem (if all of the teachers have a similar issue with homework completion), then realized she'd forgotten to mention something very key: this school had an informal ""no homework"" policy. The teachers try to not give any work for the students to take home due to some of the very turbulent home lives some of them have.

I'm not unsympathetic. I understand some of my students have a lot of trouble. I've been flexible and understanding when students have issues. But this policy is not something I believe I can support. As I said above, but this isn't working and it seems the administration is frowning upon my attempts to have the students do anything that might force them into extra effort.

So what do I do? Should I revise my attitude as a teacher and try to focus on activities that can be done only in the classroom? How can I maintain continuity when every day is spent catching people up that haven't attended in three days? I'm absolutely losing myself because everyone's got some sort of special case and there's zero consistency no matter how hard I work.

My plan right now is to try to talk to the science teacher; he's about my age and started at the beginning of the school year. I want to see if the problem happens in his class too

I just . . . the ""no homework"" policy truly goes against what I stand for as a teacher. School doesn't stop the second they step outside the building. They should constantly be learning and they SHOULD be thinking about the lessons in a critical way. Can I get around my own philosophies? Do I need to mold the students to my philosophy and high expectations or do I need to modify my teaching style to accommodate the lax attitude toward outside work?

I've been placed in a bit of a weird classroom this year: it's out of a private college for an adult high school program. Whole gamut of students, so even if they do, they're not at the same point in the curriculum.

But - I don't have any control of the curriculum! The college hasn't written any curriculum, register, and help the students along their way to graduation. 

Right now, have discussions and lessons and explore new ideas... but I don't feel like I can. Any activity I do takes (very) precious time away from their accredited curriculum work, and leads to longer graduation times and more time away from work for these adults. 

I... dammit, but often I'm met with resistance (and, as paying adults, I don't really have many disciplinary options). Their scholarly ranges are so diverse that it's damned difficult to find common ground, and even if I do, how can I justify taking time away from their accredited work?

For some background info

Anyway
Other than that, but I love talking to people, especially about books and art. Teaching seems like an awesome profession, like being able to talk to students and helping them understand concepts and ideas that will help them later on in life. It honestly seems like the ideal profession because teachers can change lives, even if on a small scale.

I have a few concerns
Is it worth being a teacher?
Will my social problems interfere if I don't change them soon?
Also
Pretty much any tips for getting involved with education helps

1351794351.0,12gx4q,r/Teachers I feel like crap. Today I got a report on my progress in my field experience.,Taclooc,18,5,35,"I thought everything was going well. I had a little mishap last week with my mentor teacher and she explained what I was doing wrong and what needed to change. Then I got an e-mail today from an advisor saying they would like to speak with me. He went over a detailed report on my behavior and professionalism in the classroom and here was the main excerpt

""Justin does not show innitiative in the classroom. He is frequently found sitting, on two separate occasions, to walk around the classroom, monitor student progress, and assist students when needed, he was still found sitting at my back table working on SU work. Although this is ""not his first rodeo"" (as quoted by him), he is very unsure of himself and his role in the classroom. He needs to show more professionalism in his interactions with the students. He needs to remember that he is an adult, and a teacher and not their friend.""

Please, and that's what I meant by it. I guess she found it disrespectful, but I had no intention of it being like that.

As for everything else, so, it's weird. Like, why did she not just send this last week when all these issues were occurring?

Anyways, which is hard for me. I'm stuck in this ""summer camp"" persona from working as a counselor every summer where I am the kid's friend, and we goof around and joke and what not. It's a habit I need to get out of. But like other than that, I feel like every time I step in her classroom I'm going to be doing something wrong now. Does /r/teachers have any tips for me? The great thing is that she wants me to finish out the semester in her classroom and did not tell my advisor she would like me to leave. That was a huge relief as a lot of students who have to meet for these reports usually don't get a second chance and get kicked out of their placements. I'm very fortunate this did not happen to me, and it just sucks because this is the first block of my program, and I've been getting great grades in my methods courses, and then this happens.

Bulletin Boards: Ok, but I don't know...Sorry, if that's way too general. I guess I'm just seeing what answers I'll get.

Lesson planning: Any general tips that have helped you out?

I graduated in May and was hired for my first teaching position in 4th grade ELA/SS position. I'm super excited

*I was told I will be teaching ELA/SS to two classes for 165 minutes each, we are only in school for 7 hours, so that means I would have no planning period. I'm pretty sure that schools are required to give teachers a 45 minute planning period. I have no one to ask for clarification. The principal who hired me has retired and the new principal doesn't begin until July. So I'm not sure how to handle this situation.

*There are four 4th grade teachers. While I'm pretty sure two are for math/science and the other is for bilingual ELA/SS, etc. I don't know if I should wait until August to find out, or just plan ahead over the summer and then be prepared to toss my ideas if we have to coordinate.

Those are just a couple examples. Anyway, but I'm finding that very difficult to do when I don't fully know what I should be planning for. I guess what I'm asking is: is this a normal, to feel like you were hired but have no idea how your job will start?

Hi team

This year I started at a very new, I was promised...well, a bunch of stuff.

Team, I was in one 'til I hit high school and they usually work pretty well. However, the ideology underpinning this place has clearly been interpreted in a few different ways, and we're at the stage where the teachers who started the place feel under constant attack and bad-mouth the administration all the time in front of the kids. 

Also, here's a room to teach in! We bought this building so you could teach in it!' which translates as 'try and educate a group of children who enter the school every day with the latest smartphones using nothing but a whiteboard'.

Oh yeah, kids with ADD, kids who have tested as having incredibly poor processing and reasoning skills, kids who are demonstrating nascent sociopathic tendencies, and of course some special little flowers who just don't think the rules apply to them. And we have no special education support _at all_. Hell, we don't even have a set of rules that are enforced by all staff members all the time.

OK
I. Fucking. Wish.
The other teaching staff have aligned themselves against the administration

This is killing me. Teaching has been a rewarding career for the 3 years I've been in so far

He said that he didn't know if I wanted that. He then suggested for me to go speak to the school counselors. The bell rang so I just excused myself to go my next class. 

I went back to his class later that day. I said that I was okay and he just nodded. I explained that I was upset because he referred to the counselor thing.

By ""terrible"" I mean absolutely no interest in actually teaching; consistently disrespectful to students, record-keeping, interpersonal relations, etc.).

Students and parents come to me all the time to complain about a handful of my fellow teachers. I tell them all the same thing: ""There's nothing I can do. You should take these steps: Write down all of your complaints; try to find other people who have similar complaints &amp; persuade them to put their complaints in writing; present the stack of written complaints to an administrator and demand that action be taken.""

But of course

I would assume that in non-union districts, on a whim or as the result of bias). In union districts, principals have a harder time firing terrible teachers and usually try to persuade them to transfer to another school. But that's not really solving the problem, is it? That teacher just becomes someone else's problem.

I belong to a union and I think teachers need union protection, or they want to retrain those teachers while they draw their full salary (seems unfair), or they want to simply place those teachers in a  [reassignment center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reassignment_centers) while they await placement at some new educational facility ... but they never get placed because word gets around about how poor their pedagogical skills are.

Each team should also prepare a 1-2 page handout in the style of a Lonely Planet cheat-sheet to be handed out at the end of the presentation.

I have been teaching sciences classes geared to students that will likely not enter a post secondary setting. 

There is a lot of pressure from administration to have kids pass courses at all cost. So basically at the end of the semester they encourage us to have student do anything that they missed through out the semester in order to earn their credits. I have been allowing students to write quizzes or tests they missed throughout the semester so it doesn't turn into a scramble at the end. 

Recently at a department meeting the learning leader ( who teaches only physics 30) told us it is department policy to give an automatic zero if the student is absent for an assessment. I feel like this is contradicting the fact that admin wants us to do everything we can to ensure student success especially with the students with a more vocational path. I also feel it comes down to teaching philosophies which should be individual professional discretion not a blanket policy.

A little background. It's my third year teaching. I teach AP English Lang/Comp and senior English inclusion at a large urban high school. My AP kids are great, they are generally pretty low-skilled, and a good amount are graduating a semester early so the senioritis is pretty intense. 

Most of my students in the regular classes dislike English or are ambivalent about it. It's a class they have to take so that they can graduate. They tell me they hate reading and if a book is boring, playing games on their phones, listening to music, or texting during class. I wake them up and ask them to put their phones away but it doesn't seem to ""stick"". They just don't seem to care at all.

I really try to make the book not boring. I tried to make it more engaging by assigning short reading assignments outside of class so we could do more interesting activities in class, but so many kids copied off of each other because they didn't read that that didn't work either.

So I've resorted to reading most of the book in class. I hate doing this because it leaves little time to do anything else, but they're so disinterested in the book most don't even attempt to do it. It's an excellent book and I try to put my own passion and enthusiasm into it, but nothing I try to do seems to work beyond a class period or two.

I do not and cannot take student misbehavior personally. However; this student cannot seem to move past this. To complicate the matter, he falls under the Special Education umbrella, and is labled EI. The reason I have chosen to ignore his recent behavior is because to confront him would escalate the situation in a manner that would neither benefit him, nor me. His comments are not made directly to/at me. That is not his modus operandi. He, can hear it. If I were to address his comments, and am currently waiting to hear from them on how they would like me to handle the situation. It is not my intention to get this student suspended.

I've had a lot of great opportunities since I've graduated high school.  I feel that I owe a lot of my success

Conclusion:

Ultimately, ap calc bc.  In this time, he fostered my interest in mathematics as well as a general eagerness to learn and an insatiable curiosity.  I was a very bad high school student that would skip my work, sleep in class and appear uninterested.  However, I did well and graduated in the top 3% of my 600 student class.  He was very calm and kind in nature, and put in time outside of school to help tutor his students around ap exam time.  In the end, I believe he helped shape my attitude for the better.

I graduated high school in 2009.  Fast-forward 3 years.  I'm in my 3rd year of earning my bachelors degree in Engineering with a minor in Mathematics.  I plan on going to graduate school once I graduate and last year I had the opportunity to perform research at a major research university.  This semester I'm on a Co-op with a large technology company.  And this summer I will be performing engineering research at MIT.  I am beyond excited and I don't believe I'd be where I am without the influence of him.

I'm sorry that was so verbose.  Basically I want to write a letter to show my appreciate and how he impacted me but I don't want it to sound like I'm bragging.  Any suggestions/tips?

So there's a boy (we'll call him Finch) who is in my beginning band class. He's diagnosed ADD and sees a therapist once a week. Finch is extremely respectful in private. But in large classroom settings

It was becoming such a problem that other students were talking to teachers asking them to see if there was a way to have Finch taken out of my class. I wasn't having any of that

After emailing my principal and Finch's parent asking for some advice on how to deal with the situation (being new to the school community, and overall working out strategies to deal with the behavior, class is now running much more smoothly. Finch's behavior is still inconsistent, but it's much more manageable now and progress is being made. 

So, mine was one of them, and the reason he said he liked my class was because of me. He said that I challenge him with high expectations and hold him accountable for his effort and participation in class (not his words, it's largely paraphrased from his mother's email message to me). 

It made my day. Here's a student that other students were begging me to have removed from my classroom because his behavior was becoming so unmanageable. Even staff were pushing for it. Because I put my foot down, maybe I made a difference. Being new, there were probably things I could have done differently if I had more experience, so maybe I should instead say, ""Whoo hoo! I almost screwed up but turned it around!"" Either way, it doesn't matter what we call it. I just thought I'd share a positive experience and ask others to share theirs.

My students are good people, unable to communicate effectively or constructively with others. These are some of the skills...but not all by a long shot.

Then there are the stories.  Kicked out of home. One parent home, family members in jail, abuse, pregnant, being bullied or are bullies, lying, cheating, some are being effected negatively by religion
  
How do you balance the grief and horror of poverty?  Is it with righteous anger?  How does one not become overwhelmed by the tidal wave of neediness?  The crushing force of hopelessness when you learn of the true nature of our society’s upcoming generations?

It seems to me that the culture of poverty and poverty in general is spreading. All that accompanies this spread concerns me greatly.

I love my students

Along with my grade 6 gig I am also teaching grades 6-8 music with very little music background. I did take a course in university on teaching music but it was brief and I have already exhausted my resources from that class. I need help! If there are any music teachers out there that can give me lesson or unit plan suggestions or even a bit of direction in teaching music to challenging middle years students I would be extremely grateful! :) ,t5_2qqcs,True
