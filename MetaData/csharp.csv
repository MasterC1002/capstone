* Couldn't I hypothetically do something in the contravariant interface method that wouldn't be allowed by the less derived type object which will be assigned? Why or why not?
* Why can a covariant type only be referenced as the return type? What is the limiting reason?
* Why can a contravariant type only be referenced as the type of the method argument and not as the return type? What is the limiting reason?
* In what situations or examples can covariance and contravariance become necessary or useful? Please keep the examples simple and/or use generic interfaces to explain since I have not reached delegates yet.

    int asd = (int)e.ViewInfo.Appointment.CustomFields[""randomName""];

was causing my program to jump to a random place in the code(jumping into another function).  
It seemed to be not completely random: First time reaching the above line = jump to line x, fourth time -&gt; line z (then i stopped testing).

Well... I solved the problem this way:

    int asd = Convert.ToInt32(e.ViewInfo.Appointment.CustomFields[""randomName""]); 


But I would still like to know what may cause behaviour like this.  
My first attemt in fixing it was completely rebuilding the project

All Ideas are welcome

UPDATE:
After hours of testing
The same thing now happens at another line

The line it jumps to is roughly in the area where something happens

There is stuff in the function that still needs to be executed,,False,self,t5_2qhdf,1376046804.0,,True

First off

I recently started work on a Project which is written in C# and has both a Front end in ASP.NET and Web Services component in WCF. A small piece of this Integration needs to be re-written to be integrated with a Third party API.

Now here are the issues

1. The current state of code has very little to almost NO documentation
2. Configuration files are old
3. Parts of code may not be used at all and there is no ""Deprecated"" advice from the Developers. 
4. NO Documentation on the Architecture
5. I do not have Debug permissions until at least 2 more weeks (Slow process within the Company for access related stuff)

With all these issues

1. Creating a process/page flow diagrams with some analysis of the Code
2. Document pieces of code that will have to be re-written for the Integration
and Finally
3. To understand the new Integration and how much of the code may / may not be re-used. 

Any direction in this regard will be of great help.

I'm hoping someone can spoon feed me a little bit.  I'm doing a summer internship where I've been tasked at creating both an app and a web interface for something.  However all of my experience is in the linux realm using LAMP (Linux, PHP).

Could someone please explain to me how exactly the following pieces fit in the puzzle:

ASP - my understanding is that this a web-centric language much like PHP is.  Yes

C# - So C# is a language.  Am I correct in the understanding that it's an extension of C in the same vein as C++ is an extension of C?  If so

.NET - I skimmed wikipedia's page on .NET but would truly appreciate a uber-brief explanation of .NET and what this ""framework"" is for.

The examples provided by the book are: 

**A statement that adds or updates a session state item**  

EX: Session[""Cart""] = cart;

**Another way to add or update a session state item**  

EX: Session.Add(""Cart""

Public Class Customer  
    Public Property FirstName As String  
    Public Property LastName As String  
    Public Property Email As String

They then want me to:

I've got that down.

That being said

I'm trying create the following program:

""Three salespeople work at Sunshine Hot Tubs— Andrea, ‘ B’, or ‘ E’). While the user does not type ‘ Z’, continue by prompting for the amount of three sales the salesperson made. Calculate the salesperson’s commission as 20 percent of the sales amount, and add the commission to a running total for that salesperson. After the user types ‘ Z’ for an initial, display each salesperson’s total commission earned, along with the total commission paid. Display a title and header for the report. Use a for loop to write the salesperson’s name

It started off as just a pre-made AIML bot

And it's been worked on off and on since. I've got a little bit of spare time this week and loaded it up after not touching it for a while. And..well

I threw the whole thing up on [google code](http://code.google.com/p/kon-csharp-chatterbot/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FBin) and while I don't really expect anyone to seriously sit down and rewrite the bot for me
I tried to comment quite a bit as I went (as I was taking months off at a time and needed to know what I was doing when I came back) so hopefully you'll be able to follow what it's trying to do lol.

Also, pre-made IRC libraries to use..I'd appreciate that as well.  I'm really more interested in the markov chain/chat bot aspect.  Having to write my own IRC client in addition has been quite a headache for me.

Thanks in advance to anyone who tries to help me out with this.",self,t5_2qhdf,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/1k6xl9/kon_the_c_irc_chat_bot_help/

I am very much stuck on SQL, and maybe I'm making this a bigger problem than it should be, but I cannot for the life of my understand the how/why of stored procedures. I get that they're run on the server side, to save resources locally, and they're essentially precompiled SQL code that you call whenever you want to perform that function ( I like to think that they're similar to a 'class' in the C# world)....but I just can't wrap my head around it. So what I am asking of you, sweet reddit, is for a super basic guide that works with Visual Studio and SQL and C# and goes step by step....creating a database, and then manipulating the data with stored procedures....my googling has given me a few resources, help me out!

Link: [AsyncBridge](https://github.com/tejacques/AsyncBridge)

Background:
While working on an older ASP.NET project, since most of the project predated async, it was not ""Turtles all the way down"" and I encountered extremely frustrating deadlocks while trying to queue up multiple tasks and wait on them. In my searching I came across several articles including [this one](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj991977.aspx) which mentioned you could ""[only] mix blocking and async code [in] Console main method"". I began trying to find ways around this, but most either didn't work or were extremely cumbersome and inelegant.

Finally after a lot of searching I came across [this class](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/163ef755-ff7b-4ea5-b226-bbe8ef5f4796/is-there-a-pattern-for-calling-an-async-method-synchronously) by John Melville which nearly did what I wanted. His class is the foundation for mine

E.G.

    public async Task&lt;string&gt; AsyncString()
    {
        await Task.Delay(1000);
        return ""TestAsync"";
    }

    public void Test()
    {
        string s = AsyncInline.RunSync(() =&gt; AsyncString());
    }

That was pretty good, which is extra boilerplate.

What I came up with was a compromise between extracting the result easily

    public async Task&lt;string&gt; AsyncString()
    {
        await Task.Delay(1000);
        return ""TestAsync"";
    }
    
    public void Test()
    {
        string string1 = """";
        string string2 = """";
    
        using (var A = AsyncHelper.Wait)
        {
            A.Run(AsyncString()
            A.Run(AsyncString()
        }
    
        // Total Execution time at this point will be ~1000ms
        // The value of string1 = ""TestAsync""
        // The value of string2 = ""TestAsync""
    }

Exceptions bubble up to the top and stop execution of all queued tasks. Here's an example:

    public async Task&lt;string&gt; AsyncStringException()
    {
        await Task.Delay(1000);
        throw new Exception(""Test Exception."");
    }

    public void TestException()
    {
        string s = """";
    
        try
        {
            using (var A = AsyncHelper.Wait)
            {
                A.Run(AsyncString()
            }
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            // e.Message                 = ""AsyncBridge.Run method threw an exception.""
            // e.InnerException.Message) = ""Test Exception.""
            // Handle exception
            // ...
        }
    }

The library also allows for easy error handling with the Fire And Forget pattern

    public void Test()
    {
        AsyncHelper.FireAndForget(
            () =&gt; { /* Do Stuff on the thread pool */ }
            exception =&gt; { /* Optional exception handling
    }

This avoids the problem that can occur with memory leaks by calling Task.Run without handling exceptions

Write a program that calculates and prints the take-home pay for a commissioned sales employee. Allow the user to enter values for the name of the employee and the sales amount for the week. Employees receive 7% of the total sales. Federal tax rate is 18%. Retirement contribution is 10%. Social Security tax rate is 6%. Use appropriate constraints.

I wanted to use two classes because in the future I think this will be a must and if I get the concepts down ill be a better student/programmer.

What I think I didnt do right: Do I want my I/O in the main class there before I create my object and pass it to it? Or do I want my Console.ReadLine(); as one of the first things in my constructor?

Is there a better way to do displayMessage() and should it be located in that class? Or should I do that a totally different way?

I need some second or third eyes to look over this

I am currently working on a winforms c# application. More specifically

To nail down some terms, which can be considered orange squares for now. He can select single components by clicking on them with the left button, he can select multiple components by dragging a box around them. Once he has components selected, he can right click and select operations like cut, paste, copy and so on with the obvious semantics. For usability reasons, he can also use these operations on a single component without selecting it. 

In the old state, they are highlighted, but after an hour, I gave up deducing that for now, especially because there are about 2 dead highlighting functions in there. Since I have to add quite a bit of funcionality here, I guess it is up to me to redo this. 

In order to redo this

I add one event per user command to the DrawingPanel. The Controller of the DrawingPanel subscribes to these events and modifies the model accordingly in the event handler. For example, a PasteRequest-Event is raised, which is parametrized by the position of the paste request.

This should encapsulate the user interface, the control flow would be greatly simplified, as it would become unidirectional: UI goes to Controller goes to Model.

Now

So far, correct functionality would depend on creating the mapping or calling the wrap+call-higher order function after all subscribers are subscribed to the event. This yells ""recipe for disaster"" for me.

Is there anyway to lock provider.SetNumber until the first function finishes? The critical section is basically the currentNumber which can be changed by many places in the program.

I hope I made myself clear

EDIT: Also I made the functions really short for the example. In reality the function is much longer and makes changes to currentNumber many times so I don't really want to put a lock around the entire function. If I lock every call to provider.SetNumber and release it after I finish it can change during the time it is released before I lock it again to call provider.SetNumber.

Why? Because I know Winforms. I know what to expect, and the last time I tried that it didn't go down very well. 

So I did the whole app in Windows forms. With more than enough time to spare

So 3 nights of coffee and no sleep

1. WPF with Visual Studio 2012 has come a long way and XAML has matured. However the whole WPF drag and drop type of styling isn't entirely there yet. Like every single other WYSIWYG editor, but this isn't too big a deal. 

Examples: When adding a groupbox control -&gt; by default it only supports 1 child

Some properties such as font colors don't update. Manually editing the XAML - fixes everything. 

2. Ok the Blend interface has some quirks - but all in all you can get everything done. 

3. What is Expression Blend? It's basically a designer tool like Macromedia Flash. However the lines blur between code and design because you can also code inside of Blend (but it's a bit limited). So it is best to have a solution open in both VS (for coding and debugging) and Blend for designing. For example you can't drag an image onto the canvas using Visual Studio

4. What is WPF anyways

IE sucks so what's the point? HTML5 rules

Don't hole your breath? WPF is still good for Winform applications and there is always the Mono implementation for Linux apps. 

5. Without any formal training was I able to create a stunning user interface? Yes absolutely. My application isn't finished, I've managed to create an app that looks a whole lot better than the Winforms app. 

6. What about animations and storyboards? Now here is where many desktop developers start getting the shivers from fear. Just remember the whole animation delivery is event driven. 

For example. I had 5 buttons I wanted to fade in and slide into view from the top of my form on FormLoad. Using Blend you assign the onLoad event to a storyboard. In the storyboard you have a time line, and 5 seconds later you have it set to 100%, the rendering takes care of the animation inbetween. Same for positioning, same for any property. 

7. Would you recommend it. Yes whole heartily. If you're a desktop WinForms developer. Take the plunge

If the CustomerResources library existed existed in the deployed package, then this would be searched for resources and if the specified resource wasn't found it would fall back to the main application (Neutral) Resources.

This would mean that only the strings and images that a customer wanted Customised would need to be their resource file

I started putting something together using a MarkUp Extension for the Resource Strings

I briefly thought about using the Localisation framework to do this (e.g. provide a ""en-GB"" or ""en-US"" resource which is customer based

I'm learning by rewriting a program that uses an XML file as a data source to use a SQL Server database as its data source.  The only problem is that my work environment is a medical one and so there are announcements going off all the time and I'm called away so often that I can't coherently string two thoughts together.  I have to write everything down so I can come back to it.  This is the bit of code I'm looking at.  I think I can grok more of it than I can explain because I don't have the vocabulary.

private static void LoadProducts(string path)

{

    products c;

    var s = new XmlSerializer(typeof (products));

    var fs = new FileStream(path

    TextReader reader = new StreamReader(fs);

    try

    {

	     fs.Position = 0;

	     c = (products) s.Deserialize(reader);

	     fs.Close();


         _toys = c.toys != null ? c.toys.ToList() : new List&lt;ProductsToy&gt;();

...............................................................................................

The first line is the declaration of a method to which is passed the xml file path in string form.

""products c"" comes from ""public partial class products"" (a class created by Visual Studio when adding the ""products.xml"" file as a data source?).  

Would the above be declaring a variable of user-defined type?

The line that really gets me is this one:

_toys = c.toys != null ? c.toys.ToList() : new List&lt;ProductsToy&gt;();

I think that this means ""Set _toys equal to the toys instance data of object c where c.toys isn't null

I figured that the MessageBox was giving the function enough time to calculate the song length and set the delay appropriately

Here is the code:

        public void play(string[] file)
        {
            foreach (var song in file)
            {
                mediaPlayer.URL = song;
                MessageBox.Show(""Magic"");
                string length = ""00:"" + mediaPlayer.currentMedia.durationString;
                double delay = TimeSpan.Parse(length).TotalSeconds;
                delay = delay * 1000;
                int milisecs = Convert.ToInt32(delay);
                Thread.Sleep(milisecs);
            }            
        }

Some of you may remember my previous post, solved my issue, and now I have something that works. It, however, doesn't seem terribly pretty.

One of my issues was ""A search can return multiple items. In that case, a MultipleItemsVM class, and sending a message called MultipleItemsFound(list_of_items, callback), and I send the message ""MultipleItemsFound(list_of_items, (i) =&gt; Sale.add(i)"". There's a little bit of CodeBehind to make the window appear and hide according to the contents of the DatraGrid. This seems acceptable, but maybe I'm missing something.

This works.

I thought, which would consist of a Textbox, and a Popup with a Textbox and a DataGrid. This element has the following behavior: 

* When an user presses Enter
      * If no items match
      * If one item matches
      * If more than one item matches
* When the user presses F2

* The popup has 2 elements
     * When text is entered into its textbox
     * If the user double-clicks on an element
     * If the user hits Escape

Then, it would trigger one of two events: AddItem, and RemoveItem, and it would also have a Count property, since one can type ""2*f00b4r"" to add 2 of some item type).

Should this be a simple, for example? Or am I just making a mess of myself and one is simply supposed to create VMs when changing the view ""drastically""?)

Is this possible/correct/totally stupid? Should I stay with the first solution?

I know I'm overthinking this; I overengineer solutions in personal projects so they become simple when I need to do stuff quickly.

I got some great feedback from you all last time and made several changes in that regard.

* You can now reference multiple lines in a comment using ""at notation"". If you want to reference line 3 in your comment you would say ""@3"" that will get turned into a link that when clicked will flash line 3 red. If you want to reference a block of code you can type ""@3-5"" that will reference lines 3
* The home page has been reworked to show all reviews (using infinite scroll) you can also optionally filter the reviews by language.
* SSL is used over the whole site to improve security.
* Red comment tabs appear on both sides of a review now so they should be more noticeable.

I did consider using an array and populating it using a loop. But that feel apart when I realised I couldnt come up with a recursive way of generating the numbers.

It turns out that it's not just a little bit slower than a basic struct,000 times on the Color struct and the basic byte struct are:

* Color: 0.196 seconds.
* Struct: 0.022 seconds.

It's even slower if you use one of the built in colours instead of FromArgb()
