This is a randomizer program that takes a different route to the Reasonable gen3 randomizer recently released - instead of randomizing one set of games extremely thoroughly it aims to randomize every Pokemon game equally well

Right now it supports every main-series English ROM

 * Starter Pokemon
 * Wild Pokemon
 * Trainers Pokemon
 * Pokemon Base Stats
 * Pokemon Types
 * Pokemon Abilities
 * Pokemon Movesets
 * TM Moves
 * TM/HM Learnability
 * Static Pokemon (e.g. given by NPCs
 * The moves that Move Tutors teach


The [download is here](http://code.google.com/p/universal-pokemon-randomizer/downloads/detail?name=UPRandomizer-120a.zip&amp;can=2&amp;q=) and you can get the source code [here](http://code.google.com/p/universal-pokemon-randomizer/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Frandomizer)

The [version which doesn't need an external config directory is here](http://code.google.com/p/universal-pokemon-randomizer/downloads/detail?name=UPRandomizer-120a-InternalConfig.zip&amp;can=2&amp;q=). Use this if the original complains about missing config files even after extraction.

Future features:

 * Much more support for non-English ROMs
 * Foreign language support for the program itself
 * More cool ASM hacks that you can apply to the games to customize your experience a little bit further.

I then got in touch with the developer of the Gen 2/3 randomizer to see if he could edit it to include the 4th and 5th gen Pokemon. He did, and some Pokemon will cause the game to crash. I figure the more people we have playtesting it, the more bugs we'll catch.

Hello /r/PokemonROMhacks! brownie here with great news. We’re bringing back the Featured Hack! It’s had quite a bit of time off and we’ve tweaked it and done our best to make it the most interesting event we can. So here are the new features in what I like to call Featured Hack 2.0!

* The featured hack will change once a month (Hack of the Month
* There will be a quarterly subreddit-wide vote to decide on their favorite HOTM (Hack of the Quarter
* At the end of the year

The HOTM’s will most likely only be hacks that are at least halfway done or have a considerable amount of game time. This way

That’s not all though! Do you have a new/upcoming hack that you want to share with the rest of us? If it has *at least* 4-6 hours of gameplay

We’re not done yet! If you have any suggestions on what hack we should feature or how we should approach the event

Think you would be interested in helping out with this? We are looking for a couple volunteers to help with the entire process! Please [send me a pm](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=browniebiznatch) with information as to why you should be considered for this project as well as your experience playing hacks. We will send you a PM in response as to whether you will join the team.

You can try out a ""proof of concept"" of the battle system in your browser [here](http://www.swfme.com/view/1054502)!  And [here](http://imgur.com/a/ELtBy) is a screenshot album I made recently

A large focus of Evoas is redefining the battle system.  The most obvious change is the graphical style.  Pokemon are animated, the camera now views the battle from the side, and moves around to make moves more cinematic.  

The other big change Evoas brings to battles are the moves.  In this game, the moves in Evoas have been created from the ground up with 2 on 2 battles in mind.  There's a much bigger emphasis on cooperation, with many moves designed to help allies.  About 75% of the moves will be completely new, and all the returning moves will be tweaked to have slightly different attack power or abilities.

There are a ton of other smaller changes made to the battle system that are too numerous to mention here.  I'd recommend you try out the preview listed above and find them out for yourself!

You can subscribe to the Pokemon Evoas [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonEvoas/) or check out the game's [thread](http://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=305337) on pokecommunity.com where I will routinely post updates.

I was lucky enough to use sprites made by the talented Deviantart and SpritersResource user JoshR691, but I don't want to be limited to just including pokemon he's made sprites for.  I haven't been able to contact him either.

In short, I could really use the artistic talent of anyone that has even a passing interest in my game.  I'm also interested in recruiting a music composer, writer, background artist, anything else really that can make this game as good as possible.  In return, I offer my skills as a programmer to help you on your personal project, if you have one.  If anyone needs help in AS3 or C++, and can really raise the benchmark for pokemon fan games if done correctly.  Please PM me if you're interested.",t5_2t5aw,True

Well it's been an impressive few weeks for us in /r/PokemonROMhacks. Take a look at the subscriber count and the success of the HotWs if you don't believe me. I *hate* clichés but this could not have happened without you guys.

**A wild flair appears!**
 
To reward those of you who really put some effort in to helping this happen. We'll be giving out flairs to those of you who consistently post thoughtful, amusing stories, or information for other redditors.  
We also have a few ~~legen....wait for it... dary~~ flairs in reserve for those that really go that extra mile.

**Hack of the Weeks**  

The last couple of Hacks of the Week have been repetitive and a lot of you have voiced your opinion that we should feature more complete hacks. In the future complete hacks will become the 'Hack of the Fortnight' to enable people to have time to complete the hack. One of these should appear roughly every four hacks.

**Hacking Tutorials &amp; Community Hack**

A lot of you have been asking 'How do I start hacking?' and more often than not those thread have gone mostly unanswered. That sucks. To change that we're producing a series of tutorials that will cover the basics to help any of you who would love to start hacking get involved. The goal is that any one with an interest will be able to pick up the basics of ROM hacking by following the comprehensive guide. 

The screenshots and examples used in these guides will be all actual modifcations done to a base ROM that will be opened up for the community as the /r/PokemonROMhacks Community Hack. Anyone who has read and practised the tutorials should be able to contribute to the community hack. Hopefully the subreddit will produce one of the few complete ROM hacks out there.

**So how can I get involved?**

We're looking for tutorial requests

We also want suggestions for the hack

What are your suggestions for?

* The ROM base used
* Tilesets used
* The plot
* The style of gameplay

Finally, and what don't you want to see at all? If you have *any* suggestions or ideas post them in the comments.

**tl;dr** New flairs for top contributors, we want your ideas. Also looking for someone to condense my posts into a readable format. What say you?",,False,,t5_2t5aw,False,,moderator

So Circa 2005~2006. The foreign Pokemon Rom Hacking Scene is ""thriving"", though, there was no such thing. So this guy whose Alias is Virus decided to create an Naver Cafe, which is a small forum-like site. It was called *Pokemon Rom Hacking Specialist*. He started to translate all the tools such as un-Lz, Advanced Map, etc into Korean and started to post guides on it. He mainly made Pokemon Gold Hacks because it was the only version at the time that was in Korean. In fact, he singlehandedly made the Table for the Hexcode to Text of Pokemon Gold Korean Version (This was very hard to do

I found his site at around 2006, with Rom Hack projects everywhere. Granted, it was mostly ""changing sprites"" hacks, or alternate version hacks, but it was quite amazing what he was able to do. 

But for me, which limited the people who were able to hack Pokemon in Korean. Only his closest could do it. So, I decided to create another Naver Cafe (Website) to counter his own. Me and some people were ""proficient"" Pokemon Rom Hackers compared to the rest, so people came over to our site to see all the guides and download our patches. We were also one of the few people who could change the title screen (I know, right? That was how low our skills were).

A few years later, so he could not continue with his site. What's kind of saddening is that after his site went down, the Korean Rom Hacking Scene virtually died; and I feel partially responsible.

And today, because the situation was almost like a novel. It felt convoluted almost. How could something like this actually happen?

Well

I'll post some links to his hacks maybe!",,t5_2t5aw,1376759609.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/1kjvwv/story_of_virus_a_pokemon_rom_hacker/

This is pretty easy but it can be time consuming depending on how many pokemon you want to add.  
**Things you will need**: GBA Rom
  
**Things to note before starting**:   
1) You can add some Pokemon without replacing others but giving them a pokedex entry is hard and not really worth it.  
2) You don't absolutely have to give them a shiny sprite but you need a front and back sprite.  
3) [Here](http://imgur.com/a/zrUCg#0) are some sprites from the IV and V generation(no shinies
  
**Step 1**:  Open YAPE
http://i.imgur.com/v0aX34W.png?1  

**Step 2**: Save and open Advanced Pokemon Sprite Editor. In this program

**Step 3**: Click ""edit"" and this will show up

**Step 4**: Click ""import"" and load each sprite to its area(Or click ""import all"" if you have a sprite library)  
http://i.imgur.com/YXIlXZh.png  
  
**Step 5**: Click ""Synchronize Palettes"" and the sprites down will appear normal(hopefully). If they do(which they should)

**Step 6**: Click ""write to rom"" and this will appear  
http://imgur.com/BoaXKgs  

**Step 7**: Don't panic
  
**Step 8**: Reopen your rom in YAPE and find your pokemon.You might have noticed that there are a ton of options regarding the  pokemon. These includes their average stats, growth rate, gender, pokedex entry(unless you chose ""?"" to add a new pokemon without replacing one), etc...   
If you need information on already existing pokemon
Be sure to edit these the way you want and then save. We're done!

I'm working on this in hopes of creating a 386 patch for Emerald that also provides a decent challenge without resorting to something silly like the Elite Four being in the 90s.

Influenced by a round of VoltWhite, as well as beefing up the structures of all trainers teams. Team Magma Grunts, for example, now carry species such as Arcanine and Golem, instead of just Zubat and Mightyena, and rematch teams for Gym Leaders have taken on set ups similar in challenge to their PWT appearances in B2W2. Additionally (and seen on /r/Pokemon [recently](http://www.reddit.com/tb/1dv1zn)), I have included a few cameos from popular Nuzlocke runs

In the current patch, as I have yet to write events for them. Snorlax, however, has been given his own little event tucked away on a certain route.

The Safari Zone has been a wonderful example of small changes. Species such as Tauros and Vibrava have taken residence in the habitats. Additionally

As for moves, thanks to the aid of PokeCommunity contributor DoesntKnowHowToPlay, I have been able to implement the Physical/Special split.

As far as bugs go, and Berries screens resulting from repointing trainers. Nothing else has shown up.

**V1.0 TL;DR**

* Majority of 386 available

* More open Safari Zone

* Trainers from Littleroot to Ever Grande have been altered to present more variety and challenge

* A few species (mainly starters) have had Ability and Moveset alterations

* Cameos by 4 popular Nuzlockers

Thanks for taking the time to read and look at my work! I hope you all enjoy!

Included documentation for the patch includes Habitat Listings

The 2 most useful things are the Excel workbook with the dozen or so spreadsheets and the big IDA database.  The database has 3500 of the functions Gamefreak coded labelled with descriptive names and most also have included return types and arguments.  It's pretty massive amount of work and was done entirely by me.  The .s files with the names that match the IDB files are text versions.  Use those if you don't have IDA.  Also there's a small NARC loader that's partially done and written in C in the script decompiler.  That might be useful to someone.

Fun fact for anyone still reading this: Gamefreak made a big mistake with Emerald, you'll see one called ""wait_for_vblank_bad_code"".  They don't put the CPU to ""sleep""(basically a very low-power waiting mode) while waiting for vdraw, so it cycles endlessly waiting for scanline number 160 to indicate vblank.  This cuts the battery life for Emerald, FR, and LG by 30-50%.  It also made the games a little bit laggy in places.  I patched the games to use the right software interrupt call(SWI 05) and framerates for basically everyone quadrupled in VBA and the occasional lagginess when switching areas and stuff went away.  I blame Gamefreak because they did it the right way in Ruby and Sapphire and the wrong way in all the other gen 3 games.  Someone didn't read all the documentation and didn't realize what they were doing by switching how they waited for vblank to occur.  It wouldn't be a problem, but the end result screws all the players over especially with regard to battery life.

1356140738.0,159cta,Pokemon 3rd Gen Reasonable Randomizer,LAT10S,42,10,40,"Hello r/PokemonROMhacks

The [Reasonable Randomizer](http://code.google.com/p/pokemon-reasonable-randomizer/downloads/list) is a Java program that can modify the starter pokemon, LeafGreen, Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire, and with English, Japanese and French ROMs. The Reasonable Randomizer is different from other randomization programs in that it offers options for limited randomization, which means it won't simply pick any random pokemon from Bulbasaur to Deoxys, pokemon strength

I've hosted the program on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/pokemon-reasonable-randomizer). I've also included the Java source code with the program

##Randomizer Features:

+  **Unevolved starters** - You have the option to make randomized starters unevolved. 

+  **Limit wild pokemon randomization based on strength** - this makes it so that every wild pokemon that is replaced has roughly the same strength as the pokemon that is replacing it. This means that it will be very unlikely to find pokemon like Groudon in Route 101 and pokemon like Weedle in Cerulean Cave.

+  **Limit wild pokemon randomization based on habitat** - this causes the randomizer to replace wild pokemon with pokemon that have the same habitat. Selecting this option means that you won't find, or wild Horsea in the middle of a cave. 

+  **Limit Trainer pokemon randomization based on strength** - this causes every trainer pokemon that is replaced to have roughly the same strength as the pokemon that is replacing it. It means that Youngster Joey won't end up with, while Lance doesn't get pokemon like Rattata.

+  **Trainers retain type specialties** - choosing this option will cause type specialist trainers to only recieve pokemon that match their type specialty. For instance

+  **Rival retains pokemon** - the rival's last pokemon will be kept constant throughout the game

+  **Rematch trainers retain their pokemon** - trainers that can rematch will keep the pokemon they originally used. The program keeps track of the evolutions as well

+  **Trainer pokemon get randomized movesets** - the reasonable randomizer program doesn't pick completely random moves; it cobbles together random movesets from the pokemon's naturally learned moves, and tutor moves. You also have the option to use advanced movesets, which are predefined movesets that are strategically coherent. I basically used Battle Factory movesets for the advanced movesets, as well as Smogon for legendary pokemon.

1340642198.0,vktsj,Tutorial 1: XSE Scripting,BHLHB3,34,3,29,"The aim of this tutorial is to get you running a copy of Pokémon Game Editor (PGE) -- the Pokémon ROM hacking toolbox and creating your very first dialogue script in XSE.

---  
##Section One - Installing PGE and XSE
First let's download PGE. In the sidebar locate the link to the [Community DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/opb8xcv4zrc8tgj/D34CQ8Dpj1). Then navigate to Hacking Tools -&gt; PC -&gt; GBA -&gt; Pokemon_Game_Editor_Setup-1.0.0.0.msi

Download the file, click install then run PGE (labelled GBAPokemonGameEditor) from the Start menu.

After you run the program you'll be prompted to update it to the latest version

This window is where (most) of the tools used for GBA ROM hacking can be found. We'll start by exploring XSE. Cick on the XSE icon (second on the first row). You'll be [asked to install it](http://i.imgur.com/vz7e8.png)

---
##Section Two - Your First Script
Let's take a moment to consider what a script is. A script is a piece of code that executes when an event occurs in the game world to trigger it. An example of an event might be selecting which Pokemon to use at the start of a game

Every script starts with a similar line of code

    #dynamic 0xOFFSET

Where OFFSET is the location of the free space in the ROM you want to store the script. Think of a ROM like one big book where the scripts are the various paragraphs that make up the book. In this analogy

Now we've got the first line out of the way let's see a short complete script and break it down line by line.

    #dynamic 0x800000
    #org @main
    lock
    faceplayer
    msgbox @spk1 0x6
    release
    end
    
    #org @spk1
    = Hello world!

**#dynamic** 0x800000 is the location of the free space this script will store itself in.

The **#org** pseudo-command is used to signify the start of a script

**lock** is used to lock the player in their position and unable to move. It's commonly used during dialogue to stop the player moving around while a character is talking.

**faceplayer** is used to make the NPC face the player while they talk.

The **msgbox** command is made up of two parts. The command 'msgbox' which is used to produce a message box and the @spk1 and 0x6 argument. An argument gives the command the information it needs to work. Think of it like a vending machine

The @spk1 argument references the @spk1 portion of the script that contains the string of text we want to appear

| Offset | Type of Box |
|:--: | :-- |
| 0x2| Normal message box with automatic lock
|0x3 | Used for signs |
|0x4 | Normal message box that does not close automatically. Works in conjunction with the **closeonkeypress** command |
|0x5 | Yes/No message box |
|0x6 | Normal message box |

The **release** command undoes the **lock** command and allows the player to move again.

The **end** command signifies the end of a script.

---
## Section 3 - Expanded Dialogue Techniques

Now you have the basic building blocks of a dialogue script. Let's cover some of the finer details.

In our previous example the text used was mostly very simple. There were no line-breaks, or stored variables such as a player name. If you want to use these things in a string things get slightly more complex. 

**\n** is used to produce a new line. For example

    #org @spk1
        = Hello world!\nI'm BHLHB3.

Would appear as

&gt;Hello world!  
&gt;I'm BHLHB3  

**\l** is also used for a new line but can only be used after \n has previously been used.  
**\p** is used to start a new text-box. 

**\h** is used in conjunction with a hex-code to insert a specific character such as the Pokedollar symbol.
**\c** is used in conjunction with a hex-code to colour specific text. 
**\v** is used in conjunction with a hex-code to recall stored text such as the player's name.

However instead of handling hex codes XSE has a simpler way of handling this. Hidden under the Tools menu is the [Text Adjuster](http://i.imgur.com/nH5DD.png). This can also be brought up using the short cut Ctrl+T.

The text adjuster automatically inputs the codes for line-breaks and new message boxes. A new line of text creates a new line and a line break produces a new text box. By right clicking anywhere in the text adjuster window you can produce a menu that includes the option to insert a number of [special character](http://i.imgur.com/cv7d7.png)s.

For those characters and other pieces of text that cannot be inserted through the special character tool XSE does have limited support for a number of 'short-codes' which save you using \h

To find a list of these short-codes consult our [XSE short code reference](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/vjgli/xse_codes/).

Now we've covered the basics of dialogue we should be able to put together a dialogue script that:

* Stops the player from moving
* Forces the sprite that's talking to look at the player
* Contains multiple lines of dialogue
* Uses symbol such as the Pokedollar

Using the previous script as a template try producing a script where a character complains about the price of Super Potions at the local Pokemart and then follow the rest of the guide to produce a working in-game script.

After you've written your script -- it's good practise to check it works before compiling it (putting it into a ROM). To do this press the [debug button](http://i.imgur.com/aXl45.png), if it's not already open, and click on the button labelled FSF, the fourth along on the second row that looks like a magnifying glass.

This tool is called Free Space Finder (FSF) and is used to find offsets where you can insert data, you may wish to make copies of your original ROM so that you always have a copy available. Then hit the find button, [this is an example output of all the free space available](http://i.imgur.com/wPzze.png).

Now go back to XSE and choose any of these offsets to be your dynamic offset at the start of your script. Once you have chosen an offset and have a working script it's time to compile. Click the first button on the toolbar and navigate to the ROM you just used with FSF. Once it is open press the third button on the toolbar to compile the script. The script is now stored in the ROM

Open PGE back up and you'll notice on the first row of icons 'Advance Map' appears twice

The first thing you should do is head to:  Settings -&gt; 'Choose script editor'. [You'll be prompted to press yes or no](http://i.imgur.com/0wu7i.png)

Open the ROM your script is in by going to File -&gt; Load ROM or pressing Ctrl+O. [The sidebar will fill up with information](http://i.imgur.com/Gk2uf.png)

Now we can see the sprites on the map we can locate the sprite we want to have our dialogue script, in my case this is 800000. Be wary of copy and pasting -- Advance Map pads the number, If you paste 800000 it'll appear as 800000**80**. Make sure to remove any extra digits.

Save your ROM using File -&gt; Save or Ctrl+S and load it up in an emulator to check your script.

## Section 5 - Extension
If you've handled the tutorial well so far try one or two of the following ideas and post your scripts as a reply.

**Backstory**


Anywho it is based in an alternate pokemon universe where Red/Ash never existed, Pokemon Tower, &amp; Silph Co. allowing him to capture Mewtwo, and with mewtwo in his arsenal he easily beat the E4 and Lance. As the most powerful trainer in Kanto, with an army of henchman nonetheless, he began a hostile takeover of Kanto. Starting with replacing the elite four and brainwashing the gym leaders. And because Red was never there to compete and encourage Green/Gary, Green joined team Rocket and with his exceptional talent became Giovanni's right hand man.




Once Lance was beaten he returned to his home in Johto feeling more than helpless.




Two years later Giovanni has succesfully taken over the entire Kanto region and is attempting to invade Johto.






**Story**


You just turned ten years old and Lance is urging your mother, larvitar, or charmander. You then are sent off down route 45 to meet professor Elm to register as a pokemon trainer and recieve a pokedex. Elm gives you your pokedex, points you in the right direction and wishes you the best of luck. On your journey through Johto not much is different other than that you face many more members of team rocket, every pokemon is available to catch, and your rival isn't silver.... it's gold. Although the more you progress through Johto the more apparent team rocket becomes in each town. Until you stop team rocket at the Radio Tower, they then give up on taking over Johto for the time being. Though this is no easy feat, more like cold calculating diverse trainers with a lust for destruction. After you've acquired all eight badges you gain access to victory road. But you've also gained a name for yourself, instead you face Green who has taken his previous defeat personally and trained nonstop since to make sure your total annihilation is carried out.


Assuming you beat Green.... you finally gain access to Kanto and the entire region is in shambles due to team rocket shamelessly raping the country of it's goods and pokemon. But you can restore the country to it's once great glory. By defeating the gym leaders and reversing Giovanni's brainwashing techniques on them. After your victory over Giovanni's most trusted subjects

If anyone is interested in helping me make this idea into an actual game, so any help will be appreciated so long as you are truly interested in helping and won't give up after a month. It will be done on a silver rom btw. And if anyone has suggestions for the story or even sees holes in mine feel free to bring them to my attention.

                      ===                                                                     ===

This project is aimed at making every included final stage Pokémon useful in at least one role even at the “End Game” in order to promote fair, overpopulated Gym leaders with perfect coverage on the second Gym.

I intend to do this by:

* Standardizing and redistributing every included Pokemon's BST
* Raking through the movepools of every included Pokemon
* Standardizing Moves themselves and the effects each type brings to bear
* Redistributing the better/more battle useful Abilities to more Pokemon
* Adding more Abilities in general.
* Type effectiveness changes. Rock needs dire help.
* Lastly


All this is just for the *Pokemon themselves.* This is the reason I've decided not include all six hundred and fifty pokemon. All of Gen I/II will be in

The inclusion of later generation's pokemon and a preview of how the rebalancing will work can be seen from how Arbok and Seviper are planned to be handled. I'd like to further Arbok as a physical tank while making Seviper a special bulky counterpart with a new special version of Intimidate. I'm even leaning toward both evolving from Ekans and having a split evolution line like the Hitmon family. Of course

What I don't want to do is give every Pokemon Multiscale and Draco Meteor. Increasing weaker Pokemon's BST and expanding their movepools to where they can compete with each other as equally as possible is the way I'm going to go about it. If the Pokemon is totally devoid of any character

That only covers the battling aspect of Pokemon. But with the ease of creation RMXP allows

One NPC that's safe to talk about is your Mother(is a wildebeest). In all of the games she exists to give you a few things and heal your Pokemon. In PR:PR, your mother will need help on said farm when you leave and if expanded, so you'll be asked to catch (docile)Pokemon for her. Oak will ask you to catch specimens for him too, as Blue will invest him his grandfather though the game.



                      ===                                                                     ===

There have been a few rule changes recently that we haven’t had a chance to share with you yet.

The first change is that  we’ve now relaxed the rules on **RPGMaker games**. The only restriction on their posting is that any posts specific to RPG Maker XP such as RPG Maker must be tagged with [RPGMXP]. So posts that have to do with maps and shit

The second isn’t a specific change but rather a clarification. Questions along the lines of “How do I play a ROM Hack herp?”, approve, and delete again. Because they suck *that* much.

However submissions along the lines of “Which ROM hack has the best story?”, it’s been asked more than enough. Yeah it’s productive, but it’s kinda a crappy question if you see it once a week on average.

If there are any posts that violate any of the rules

Ok

I made a Pokemon Leaf Green mod which essentially makes the game much more balanced and fun to play yourself.

Some key points:  All fully evolved pokemon all have around 560-600 total base stats so that more pokemon are actually viable, gym leaders are more challenging, the Elite 4 are really difficult, and TMs can found on wild pokemon.

---
#How much do I know?
ROM hacking isn't an easy process -- unless you have a very specific goal

---
#Do I have time to invest in this hack?
The truth is very few hacks make it to completion. I'd say 10-20% of hacks release a BETA or ALPHA version and maybe 5% make it into a stage where a game is playable. Even less games actually ever end up 'finished'.

You can expect your hack to take you anywhere from a Summer (for minor trainer teams

Big stumbling blocks and time consuming features are using custom tiles, and creating games with multiple paths.

If you don't feel like you have a lot of time to invest in making your own hack

---
#Choosing a generation and ROM base
So you've decided you want to make a hack? You need to decide which generation and specifically which game version you want to use.

Generation I (R/B/Y) and II (G/S/C) hacking is 'old skool' at this point in time

Generation III (R/S/E + FR/LG) is by far the most popular generation to hack due to the large tool pool and the ease of entry. The three main ROM bases for generation III are Fire Red

The most notable distinction between the three is the resources available. Fire Red has a larger amount of documentation and consequently hacking it is easier. It also improves

Ruby and Emerald have a greater variety of sound effects, and Secret Bases. Emerald exclusively has the Battle Frontier and also contains battle animations. Also worth noting are the interface differences between the versions -- the bag system (e.g. the use of a TM case in FR), the Pokédex, the inclusion of a Pokénav in Ruby and Emerald, the Teachy TV in FR, and the 'Previously...' screen in FR.

The final difference I'd note is the Real-Time Clock (RTC). Ruby and Emerald cartridges have an inbuilt chip which records the passing of time for events such as berry growth and tides. Certain emulators mimic this but some do not -- using Ruby or Emerald as your ROM base will restrict your user base. There is also a RTC patch for Fire Red but it is not a feature native to the ROM.

---
#Do you run Windows?
The vast majority of tools are designed to run on a Windows machine. If you are running on a Mac then look into using Bootcamp or VirtualBox to run a copy of Windows to hack with.

---
#What tools are these?
Most of the useful tools listed here can be found the community DropBox.

For all generations I recommend Hex Workshop and [agentgeo's Pointer Calculator](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?3k8w86wyaqv3kex)

For generation I hacking, and for the brave [Lin's GB Assembler Plus](http://hax.iimarck.us/topic/1595/).

For generation III hacking I recommend [GBA Pokémon Game Editor](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cvr7b516s192usn/Pokemon_Game_Editor_Setup-1.0.0.0.msi), [Adv. Intro Editor](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gnknxvy5v5vtarb/Advance%20IntroEd.zip), [Item Manager](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xh2s81op3pzaiz9/Item%20Manager.zip), [NSE 2.0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fb40dkree89al1w/NSE%202.X.zip), and ATME.

1. The pokemon are all replaced by the Gen V pokemon. Your starters are Tepig, menu, etc. is still in English though.) EDIT: There may or may not be several Gen IV pokemon included as well.

2. You can now buy any berry in any town from a specialized person standing in the town who will sell you any berry. 

3. Some color changes: various red outfits are changed to blue.

4. A few character cameos from Gen V

5. More? Possibly. I haven't played through the whole game yet

1373157934.0,1hs07g,Nekos' Pokémon Script Generator,blacknekos,25,5,23,"Hello everyone

Anyway

The engine is known as ""Nekos' Pokémon Script Generator"" it is still being programmed and it allows you to create scripts for FireRed, I am hoping to add Emerald in the future, but I don't see many hacks of Emerald so I will do that later on.

The engine features many items that will allow you to script. It offers unlimited classes, on page 1 I have put the basic commands that you will likely use:
* Show Text
* Apply Movement
* Give Pokémon
* Give Item
* Set / Check Flags

This will only generate the script and **NOT** import it into the rom you are hacking. This is simply a generator. You will need to use a compiler such as XSE to compile the script. **But** there is going to be a button that will; 1. Download XSE into the folder (if not set) and 2. Able to open the rom and then transfer the script to XSE to compile.

This script generator is part of my Nekos' Pokémon Toolkit which currently contains two tools:
Pokémon Script Generator (For Hacks)
Pokémon Essentials Toolkit (For RMXP Pokémon Essential Games)

1372478088.0,1hakn6,Pokemon Generation 0. working idea/title.,,24,0,12,"I figured I'd post this on here (after giving away my idea in another post)

Anyway - 

POKEMON GENERATION 0 (another working title is Pokemon Grey or Pokemon Amethyst (a hack that I started back in the day but never finished)

Setting: 12 years before Pokemon Red Blue and Green during the implied 'Pokemon War'

Characters: Red and Blue's fathers (as they're not seen in R/B/G/Y and I'm assuming they've been implied as dead along with the huge absence of middle-aged adults in the games). I was thinking of using last names (although I'd have to think of one for Red's father), for instance Private OAK to begin with and then by the end General OAK or something like that.

Locations: I'd like to incorporate as many (canonical) regions as possible but not allow all 600+ pokemon to be seen/caught. I also don't want to do every region in its entirety but instead have certain cities/areas available as well as certain areas that were unavailable in each generation (example being maybe a battle atop Mt.Moon as well as inside of it). I also want to do different versions of the cities we all know, and Pallet town, which I feel like should have been much larger towns given their port access (so maybe, especially with Vermilion, I could have it on fire or something which could explain why there's a huge construction site in the middle of the city in R/B/Y/G) This leads into the next area-

Pokedex: Instead of the Pokedex

Badges: Instead of badges

Starters/Pokemon: I'd like the starters to be 'combat-trained' versions of whatever starters I decide to use (haven't decided on exact pokemon). This would basically be, but at certain points in the story you could obtain certain 'combat-trained' versions of Pokemon.

As far as catch-able Pokemon go, to pick types that are difficult to kill by electric type Pokemon and continue that trend until by the end it will be important to have a very well rounded team.

Battles: I'd like to incorporate more double battles to encourage building a diverse team (there will still be plenty of singles battles), 2 of them are fainted, and now he can't get to a PKMN Center (which will probably be more like a 'med center/tent' in the game) but still has to battle 2 'soldiers' (instead of trainers).

Cinnabar and the 'Mew Files': One of the main plot points in the game I want to incorperate is to have the final sequence (instead of the Elite 4) to be something like a battle with some tough 'government officials' or something like that in an effort to free Mew from the 'Burnt out Manor' (which won't be burnt out at this point

As a little incentive

Please take some time to answer the following questions

&gt;* Which of the following is your most preferred ROM base?
&gt;    * FireRed
&gt;    * Emerald
&gt;    * Ruby
&gt;* Which of the following is your most preferred tile set?
&gt;    * FireRed
&gt;    * Emerald
&gt;    * Ruby
&gt;* Featured Legendaries
&gt;* Should we include Fakemon? **If yes**
&gt;    *  A full fakedex?
&gt;    * Just a couple Pokémon?
&gt;    * Only pre/post Evolutions for existing Pokémon?
&gt;* What difficulty level should the ROM hack be?
&gt;    * The same as the original Pokemon game
&gt;    * Hard but by not avoiding trainer battles or fleeing from wild Pokemon most players will not struggle with gym leaders
&gt;    * Gyms and other main trainers may require specific Pokemon
&gt;
&gt;* Do you have any suggestions for starter types match up?
&gt;* Do you have any plot ideas you would like to see implemented?
&gt;* Are there any specific features that you liked in other hacks that you would like to see in this hack?

This is intended to be a method of fixing some of the issues introduced when playing Pokemon Emerald on a PC. It should also help in reducing frustration by enhancing certain aspects of the game. The ""hack"" will be quite similar to what Pokemon Volt White and Blaze Black did for BW.

The big issue I'm having right now is how to increase or otherwise change the rate at which Shiny Pokemon pop up. I've looked everywhere but have not been able to find a guide

EDIT: Since people might be curious

* Legitimate ways of obtaining all Pokemon

* Earlier access to the National Dex.

* Redundant Sun / Water / Thunder Stones so every Pokemon can be evolved.

* Wild and Enemy Pokemon will have a much harder level curve.

* Wild and Enemy Pokemon will be smarter in how they use their moves.

* TMs can be used multiple times like in BW.

* The items found throughout the game will be changed to decrease frustration.

* The game can be made into a Nuzlocke or Randomizer challenge through in-game settings.

* The Pokemon sets of some trainers will be changed for greater difficulty.

* Individual Pokemon might have their stats and (rarely) their typing changed for balance reasons.

* Individual moves might have their power and (rarely) their typing changed for balance reasons.

* Some wild Pokemon locations will have been moved around to fit all 386 Pokemon in the game.

* Pokemon that evolved by Trading or Clock Time will be given new evolution methods.

* Pokerus will be slightly more common among wild pokemon.

* Shiny status should be more common among wild pokemon.

Sound interesting? Then patch a copy of Fire Red, and comments as a reply to this thread. Let’s get some discussion going in this subreddit!

For those of you looking for an extra challenge why not try beating Lilac [nuzlocke](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Nuzlocke_Challenge) style?

As I [said last time, I was able to enhance almost every Route, Cave, and Water Source between Littleroot and Ever Grande, including the trainers within them. This time, my patch took a more battle intensive approach:

* Majority of 386 now have changes to Abilities

* Certain moves have had power

* Trade evolutions have been replaced with either Personality value (Clamperl evolves kinda like Wurmple now) or Happiness mechanics (a happy Onix is a soon to be Steelix)

* The Physical Special Split is now perfected (hopefully!) thanks to DoesntKnowHowToPlay, and Focus Punch should be eliminated

* Eevee is now hiding out on a relaxing route!

As with before, there is now a listing of all Species and move changes made since then.

Though there are many exciting points

* Bag sprites are now all just a scrambled

* Bounce and Superpower, Endure and Swift (respectively) still take their place in the list, while Mega Punch is offered as the tutorable move. Annoying indeed.

What you're going to want to do is Google whatever ROM you wish to play.  (Look in Cydia prior to Google because Cydia has a majority of Pokemon Games already available and will save you the tedious process)  If you would like to play Fire Red, download the ROM.  

Once you have the ROM file downloaded
proceed to go to   var &lt; mobile &lt; documents.

Now click done on the top right hand corner.

Click that folder and click EDIT at the top right hand corner of the screen and click on the clipboard icon and press PASTE.  Congrats

Hack of Pokemon FireRed wherein you can play as Team Rocket.
Follow a set of missions that replace the conventional gym challenges, if life was easy for Team Rocket, would Red have beaten them? But if at time it is too extreme, it is subject to change.

1357098574.0,15t1ir,Pokemon Ruby Destiny:Life of Guardians; A Review,Ianian58,22,6,22,"NOTE: LIFE OF GUARDIANS IS THE THIRD RUBY DESTINY GAME

Reccomendation: 10/10

The story starts with what most hacks begin on. A young boy/girl growing up to be a trainer in a new region

First the protagonist which I shall refer as he, have bonded and ultimately protect the Legendary Pokemon, Guardians Pokemon which take roles in the past game ""Ruby Destiny"" Games.

She runs into problems with his childhood friend

Time passes.

The Hero seeks to become a ""Guardian Trainer"" and now he must challenge the Eight Elemental Masters and ultimately challenge the Pokemon League, much darker awakens....



Scripting: 

One of the most scripted ROM Hacks I've ever played, evil and neutral at a point in the game, the scenes are amazing, the scripting I simply can't put it into words. 

10/10



Storyline:

Probably, it's large set of rivals, the Guardians and their emotional turmoils against the Dark Organazation becomes visible and trust me, as my friend said. ""You'll feel stuff playing this.""

10/10



Setting:

The Fake Pokemon became worrying

10/10



Sprites: 

The Fake Pokemon became favorite Pokemons as the amazing story backed by the grand scripting and their sprites looked better every passing second. The Fourth and Fifth Generation Pokemon also looked extrordinary

9/10



Music: 

A somewhat of a dissapointment for such a game, the variety though limited, most of the time feels well-placed.

8/10



Difficulty: 

One of the hardest ROM Hack I've played. The ""Elemental Masters"" replacing the Gym Leaders are increasingly difficult with slick strategies theses Elemental Masters will catch you off guard. And don't get me started on the ""Pokemon League""

You have various rivals, you'll see your rival sends out that Fake Pokemon which he has uses to hamper your momentum. 

Even average trainers become difficult late in game

10/10


Replayability: Moderatly High.

The few things I've changed since my last post:

* A bunch of moves (Cut is replaced by Razor Chop, signature move of Bombard - other than that, I've only made some changes to a couple of moves, mainly upping the base power of a couple of them, like Outrage, Submission and Petal Dance)
* Sprites that hover now have the circular shadow beneath them.
* New Fakemon.
* Removed *all* encounters with real Pokémon. (for realz this time. Hopefully)

But yeah, plot, characters, region and all that, but the final hack is still in the fairly distant future.

**Introduction:**

We've been able to edit various aspects of the Gen V games like Wild Encounters, event scripts and map editing have been off the table... until now!

**Background:**

Gen III event scripting has been pretty well documented and there are multiple editors that cater to it. Gen V is fairly new and things aren't well documented, and now.. how to create scripts from scratch.

Gen III ROM arrangement was pretty messy. New scripts and text had to be inserted at open offsets, once documented, is fairly easy as you just have one file to edit (say, Encounters).

For a given map, script, overworld, etc. It essentially tells you which files it uses. By editing the files for the map, editing is really easy.

**Regarding Scripts:**

The main scripts for a given map are stuffed into one file

The scripting process remains relatively the same, command. Since there are no editors which allow human friendly coding, everything has to be done via hex. It may be intimidating at first, but it's not hard! Over time we've figured out commands, given them names to understand how the script works, and finally we have been able to make script from scratch.

Drayano's Blaze Black 2 / Volt White 2 hacks are the first gen V hacks with customized scripts; at the time he didn't know how everything precisely worked. About a month later we've become more comfortable with commands and we have a way of quickly interpreting (via Lua script which reads the RAM). 

**Example:**

I wanted to demonstrate how the process works to re-purpose a useless NPC to do something special. I chose a helper NPC (in the Route Gates) and changed her script to give me an item.

[Here's the video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncbJHL36FTQ)

I tried to quickly gloss over what each command did; it's not very n00b friendly. If you understand how scripts work in Gen III

With the Lua scripts provided

**Closing:**

Gen V is really close to being fully ""hackable"", we're able to make some pretty cool hacks for the DS games.

During the initial few hours of stereotypical play, Gym leaders theorizing, etc.  
Eventually
RF and Giovanni are both forced to leave their home location (and RF his wife) to go and fight the war. This would open up a new kind of map exploration and change up the kind-of-stale travel to town
Instead of this, changing from rival to partner.
This would allow the narrative to take a decidedly more mature tone
The morality and necessity of war can be seen and discussed through the guise of battling Pokemon instead of shooting people. I think that the Pokemon games have been doing an increasingly good job of tackling real philosophical themes in their games
Towards the end of the game, Giovanni, can escape.  
The player then enters a stream of battles that they cannot win, eventually getting back to safety after his brother's last defeat.  
I know this is grim. As far as I know, I think it is important for the franchise to expand their narratives to keep the mentally stimulating and socially relevant. This tasteful depiction of death, one for a good cause, is an interesting way to look at the idea of life and death in a context that is both unrealistic enough to not be overly morbid, while still realistic enough to send a message.  
The war eventually ends, and vows to become powerful enough to control things so that he can't ever be hurt again.  
Red's mother blames Giovanni for the death of her husband
While a sad moment, pokemon and trainers walking around without fear, gyms and poke centers being re-opened, etc.  
Then, just after finishing the birth, says, 'Is it a boy or a girl?'

Okay, but here it goes.
This tutorial is a bit advanced

This script is from my hack

So I'll start with the Give Egg command. It does exactly what it sounds
    giveegg 0x(Pokemon Number Converted to Hexadecimal.)
Easy.

Next we'll go over pokepic

    showpokepic 0x(Pokemon Number Converted to Hexadecimal.) 0x(""x"" coordinate of where the picture will appear on screen) 0x(""y"" coordinate of where the picture will appear on screen)

0x0A 0x03 is the centre of the screen. Remember to also include hidepokepic at some point in your script

Lastly

    random 0x(number of options. if 03 is here
    compare 0x800D 0x0
    if 0x1 goto @gen1
    compare 0x800D 0x1
    if 0x1 goto @gen2
    compare 0x800D 0x2
    if 0x1 goto @gen3
    end

The number is assigned to 0x800D. The compares find which number between 1 and 3 was chosen
Here's an example finding a number between 1 and 10.

    random 0x0A
    compare 0x800D 0x0
    if 0x1 goto @gen1
    compare 0x800D 0x1
    if 0x1 goto @gen2
    compare 0x800D 0x2
    if 0x1 goto @gen3
    compare 0x800D 0x3
    if 0x1 goto @gen4
    compare 0x800D 0x4
    if 0x1 goto @gen5
    compare 0x800D 0x5
    if 0x1 goto @gen6
    compare 0x800D 0x6
    if 0x1 goto @gen7
    compare 0x800D 0x7
    if 0x1 goto @gen8
    compare 0x800D 0x8
    if 0x1 goto @gen3
    compare 0x800D 0x9
    if 0x1 goto @gen9


That should finish it off. If you have any questions on anything in the script
I hope someone can get some knowledge out of this!

This is the second tutorial focusing on XSE scripting. We're going to expand on everything covered by the [first tutorial](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/vktsj/tutorial_1_xse_scripting/) so if you haven't gone through it yet go back and work through it before attempting anything covered here. Due to the Reddit post character limit I've had to break what was originally one tutorial into two.

This tutorial will focus on a key concept called 'flags' and by the end of it you should have a working givepokemon script. This first part will focus on explaining flags as well as explaining the basic givepokemon command and the next part will will perfect the givepokemon script from part one.

As always if you have any questions

---
##Section 1 - Hexadecimal

It's a *very* boring start to a tutorial but a basic knowledge of what hexadecimal is will go a long way. In the previous tutorial I slipped the word in without really mentioning what it is.

In its simplest form hexadecimal is just another number system. We use, 0 through to F. A is 10, B is 11, ... F is 15.

|Decimal|Hexadecimal|
|:--|:--|
|00|0x00|
|01|0x01|
|02|0x02|
|03|0x03|
|04|0x04|
|05|0x05|
|06|0x06|
|07|0x07|
|08|0x08|
|09|0x09|
|10|0x0A|
|11|0x0B|
|12|0x0C|
|13|0x0D|
|14|0x0E|
|15|0x0F|
|16|0x10|

You'll have noticed that the hexadecimal numbers start with a leading 0x, frequently. Sometimes you'll find you even have to convert between decimal and hexadecimal. That isn't too hard as XSE contains an inbuilt converter in the sidebar.

---
##Section 2 - An Introduction to givepokemon and giveegg

Now we've finished our theory lesson let's get started on scripting again with a very simple script.

    #dynamic 0x800000
    #org @givepokemon
    msgbox @1 0x2
    givepokemon 0x7B 0x5 0x44 0x0 0x0 0x0 
    end
    
    #org @1
    = Please take care of my Scyther for me.
    
The only command you probably haven't encountered before

|Command|Usage|Example|
|:--|:--|:--|
|givepokemon|Used to give pokémon to the player|givepokemon 0xPOKEMON_NUMBER 0xLEVEL 0XITEM_NUMBER 0x0 0x0 0x0|
|giveegg|Used to give an egg to the player|giveegg 0xPOKEMON_NUMBER
givepokemon is always followed by six arguments. The first argument is the number of the Pokémon to be given, and the last three are 'filler' values and should always be **0x0**.

In the example the pokémon 0x123 is Scyther

The giveegg command

You can find lists of pokémon and item codes [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ROMhacksLibrary/comments/vtedr/index/). Remember these values must be converted to hexadecimal.

Although this script would work correctly it's different to the ones you would've encountered in-game

---
##Section 3 - Meet the Flag
Imagine you're sorting through mail at a post office and some parcels are marked with a red stamp. These parcels are fast-tracked through the system and are sent to a special part of the sorting room. Parcels that aren't marked are treated normally. This is how flags worked.

In Pokémon flags are a hex value

For example

Flags can *theoretically* be any hex value between 0x01 and 0xFFFF however

There are three important commands when using flags.

|Command|Usage|Example|
|:--|:--|:--|
|setflag|Sets a flag|setflag 0xFLAG|
|checkflag|Checks to see if a flag is on or off |checkflag 0xFLAG|
|clearflag|Turns a flag off|clearflag 0xFLAG|

Let's look at how these commands work using an example of the Scyther script with flags added.

    #dynamic 0x800000
    #org @givepokemon
    checkflag 0x100
    if 0x0 goto @give
    msgbox @2 0x2
    end
    
    #org @give
    msgbox @1 0x2
    givepokemon 0x7B 0x5 0x44 0x0 0x0 0x0
    setflag 0x100
    end
    
    #org @1
    = Please take care of my SCYTHER for\nme.
    
    #org @2
    = How is my Scyther doing [player]?

The flag used here

Checkflag

|Command|Usage|Example
|:--|:--|:--|
|if|To conditionally check the value of the previous line|if 0xVALUE COMMAND|
|goto|Used to start executing another part of the script|goto @offset|

The if command checks to see if the previous line's value matches what's expected. In the example the previous line is a checkflag and the if command is checking if the flag is off (0x0). If the flag is off the **goto** command tells the script to continue running from the @give offset where the player is given a pokemon, and the script ends. If the flag is *off* then the script continues normally, the @2 msgbox appears and the script ends.

Notice how if the player has received a pokémon before because the flag is set the player cannot receive another.
If you try and compile this script and run it you'll notice it seems rather awkward. You get no confirmation you received the pokémon and you can't even open up the Pokémon menu to check it's there! In fact the only indication the script is running 'correctly' is that the character you ran the script on will switch dialogues after talking to him once. These are all limitations we'll cover in the next part of the tutorial. 

---
##Section 4 - More on Flags

Flags' main use is for ensuring events only occur once and for making overworld sprites disappear but a some flags have special predetermined effects. such as activating Running Shoes. A lot of things the player is made to believe are items are actually just flags that have been set. Here are some examples:

|Flag | Effect |
|:-- | :--|
|0x820|First Badge|
|0x828|Pokemon Menu Item|
|0x829|Pokedex|
|0x82F|Running Shoes|
A full list of these flags can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ROMhacksLibrary/comments/vtgcn/special_flags/).

These flags are used just like normal

The most unusual of the list is the 'Pokémon Menu Item'

---
##Section 5 -- What's Next?

This brings us to the end of this tutorial part. The next part will focus on perfecting the givepokemon script from section 3.

1356675662.0,15k86t,"Tutorial: How to Edit Trainers, Species, and Encounters in B2W2",Kaphotics,19,1, editing DS games is VERY easy.

**Section 0 - Advantages of the DS Filesystem**

* In the GBA series of games
* In the DS series of games

---------------------------------------------------------

* Due to this tidy separation of files

| Extension | Description |  
|:--: | :-- |  
|**.sdat** | Audio data file used by the Nintendo DS
|**.narc** | Archive file used by games for the Nintendo DS portable gaming system; may contain various game data, and level information; typically contained within a Nintendo DS ROM file; can be unpacked with some editing tools.|  
|**.bin** | Binary file used by the Nintendo DS series portable gaming systems; contains executable data for a Nintendo DS game; can be used to patch

These are the most common file extensions you will see in DS games, Tiles, and animations**. These won't be covered since this is just an intro.

---------------------------------------------------------

**Section 1 - Common Focuses of ROM Hacks**

When you think of a ROM hack, Movesets, Evolutions, Overworld/Event Scripts, and Maps. 

For this tutorial

----------------------------------------------------------

**Section 2 - Editing Encounters

With an unmodified ROM

* When you open the program
* Editing is very easy. Just select the species that you want to edit
* If you select the [Evolution Editor tab](http://i.imgur.com/3DTbU.png)

To edit the wild Pokemon that appear

* Select Encounter Slot Editor
* Select a location that you wish to edit. The UI is straight-forward in how to edit..
* Encounter ""Slots"" have different chances of being chosen. In general
* For water encounters
* Ignore the ""Habitat Header"" data at the bottom. 

| Slot # | Appearance Chance |  
|:--: | : |  
|Slot 0| 20%|
|Slot 1| 20%|
|Slot 2| 10%|
|Slot 3| 10%|
|Slot 4| 10%|
|Slot 5| 10%|
|Slot 6| 5%|
|Slot 7| 5%|
|Slot 8| 4%|
|Slot 9| 4%|
|Slot 10| 1%|
|Slot 11| 1%|

You can also use the move editor to change up base power and typing of moves

**When you are done with your changes

------------------------------------------------------

**Section 3 - Extracting NARCs**

As discussed in Section 0

We will use Nitro Explorer to extract and reinsert NARCs (into/from the ROM)

MODS: [add these to the dropbox](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12206225/pporg/Nitro%20%26%20Editor.zip)

------------------------------------------------------

**Section 4 - Editing Trainers and their Pokemon**

[KazoWAR (the maker of BWTE) has made a video tutorial on how to use his tool](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVVjaRgmB9Y). 

[Here's a picture of what BWTE v2 looks like](http://i.imgur.com/6pmNr.png).

Just do the same thing he does....**EXCEPT**

* Extract/Reinsert /a/0/9/1 as trdata (rather than a092)
* Extract/Reinsert /a/0/9/2 as trpoke (rather than a093)

His video was made for BW1

Note: 

* When you re-insert a narc
* You can re-insert as many times as you want. The program just switches the two files. 
* Since we are editing NARCs

-----------------------------------------------------

**Section 5 - Closing**

With these two tools you can make huge edits to your B2W2 ROM. There are tons of more things we are able to edit; these are by far the easiest to learn to hack DS games with so it's best to end here :)

--Completely new routes and areas (hidden pyramid/ruins?) for explorers to take before paved and well-traveled routes allow wildlife to fill in completely in the future; also old routes being more overgrown and randomly set up.

*The main villainous team of the region is named Team Zodiac, said to hold all of the answers to the universe. The sub-admins (if any) are based off of their respective zodiacs. For example, Sub-Admin(s) Pisces are actually male/female twins, specialize in Water and Ice type Pokemon, and have a bad habit of interrupting each other.

1. Which existing starters should stay in the rom hack, Gen III, Gen IV, or Gen V? I might keep both of the remaining gen starters, but I was thinking of having a set of six mid-game trades, three for each starter set left. They may pick one trade out of the six, and once they choose

2. Which Pokemon do you think should stay, via egg moves, level, tm, tutor, etc. Base stats, etc. Nothing un-nessasary though please, due to pre-evo/new-evo plans based off of MagesPages' source art:
Tropius (pre-evo)
Aerodactyl (pre-evo)
Murkrow (pre-evo)

Mr. Mime (evo)

3. What should the heroine look like?
Hair style? Hair color? Clothes? Such as what type of shoes? What sort of t-shirt? Any accesories such as like watches? What color should her backpack be?

4. What should the rival be like and look like?
What should be the default name(s)? What sort of personality? Snooty and cocky like Gen I's rival? Cruel and antagonistic like Gen II's rival? Friendly like the later generation rivals? A composition/something more complex? Any motives or goals they have? Any particular past events in their lives?

Tools you will need:
A hex editor (I am using Goldfinger
Windows Calculator (Programmer mode)
or any other alternate Dec to Hex calculator.

**Section 1: Preparation**

Many people just from reading the word 'Hex Editor' will likely be put off

To those that aren't aware about the specifics of hex, B, C, D, E and F are equal to 10, 11, 12, 14

To begin

http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_moves

As the list shows

http://i.imgur.com/DT8RWtN.png

Then click Hex. which is above Dec. It will then have converted your number, and XX are the last two. If you use a move like Hydro Pump, write it down in the form 38 00. It will always be a 4 digit number. If you have a three digit number in hex such as 17D, write it down as 7D 01.

You now have your move in byte form.

**Section 2: Replacing the TM**

Here is where we crack open the Hex Editor. Luckily it is a very simple process and you don't need to be particularly familiar with Hex Editing. Open up your rom with your hex editor. Every hex editor has a 'goto' function

http://i.imgur.com/mWzz13M.png

Type in the following offset:
45A80C

This is where the TM table is located. This is specific to Firered so don't try this in Ruby or Emerald. For Ruby it is located at 376504

Once at your offset you should see the following bytes

08 01 51 01. 

http://i.imgur.com/nOUKPLA.png

These are the first two TMs. 08 01 in the form YYXX will be 108, so you can find each TM number fairly easy by navigating from this first byte. 

Take note of the two bytes you will be replacing

**Section 3: Replace other bytes**

Now, which in my case are 38 00 51 01.

http://i.imgur.com/PQD2JYh.png

Click replace.
It should say that there are no results

http://i.imgur.com/l1VIkhp.png

It should take you to the offset 45A5A4 if you are replacing the first TM. Click replace. Then click save.

Congratulations you have now replaced your first TM.

Note: This will not automatically change the Pokemon which are able to learn the TM. You can do that with either Pokemon Game Editors Pokemon Editor, PE will be able to display the correct move data to avoid confusion. Also PGE contains many tools that will allow for better TM customisation such as the Item editor and the attack editor.

Note two: This alone will not change the TM information about the move. You can either do this with Advance-text or by repointing the TM description data within PGE's Item Editor,False,,t5_2t5aw,1361634315.0,,,t3_192y66

**What you'll need:**  
Advance Map 1.92 (to assign the battle to a sprite)  
XSE (I use version 1.1.1)  
A-Trainer  
  
---
##Section 1: The Setup  
The new code here is:  
`trainerbattle 0x0 0xTRAINER_NUMBER 0x0 @intro @defeat`  
**Here's what it does:**  


| Code | Description |
|:--: | :-- |
| `trainerbattle`| tells XSE that you're going to fight someone|
| `0x0`| it's just needed so keep it|  
| `0xTRAINER_NUMBER`| This is what you need A-trainer for. You're going to put the trainer number from there in the place of TRAINER_NUMBER.|  
| `0x0`| just leave it alone again|  
| `@intro`| this is going to be a message box
| `@defeat`| this is what the trainer says during the battle but after you win.|  
---
##Section 2: Battle Example  
Here we'll look at how the full code will look when you put it in XSE:  
  
    #dynamic 0x800000  
    #org @start  
    trainerbattle 0x0 0x0C3 0x0 @intro @defeat  
    msgbox @msg 0x2  
    end  
  
    #org @intro  
    = Hey kid

    #org @defeat  
    = Well
  
    #org @msg  
    = Have you heard of PETA? Their HQ\nis to the south in Wicari City.  
  
You'll notice a msgbox after the trainerbattle code. That's what the trainer will say when you talk to them on the map after you've already battled them!  

---
## Section 3: The Gym Battle  
  
  The Gym leader code is very similar but there are two key differences:  
  `trainerbattle 0x1 0xTRAINER_NUMBER 0x0 @intro @defeat @after`  
  Instead of a 0x0 we have a 0x1, on the map!  

---  
##Section 4: Gym Code Example  

    #dynamic 0x800000  
  
    #org @start  
    trainerbattle 0x1 0x14E 0x0 @intro @defeat @after  
    msgbox @msg 0x2  
    end  
  
    #org @after  
    msgbox @msg2 0x2  
    end  
  
    #org @intro  
    = Wanna fight?  
  
    #org @defeat  
    = How'd I lose?  
  
    #org @msg  
    = I say this when you ask to talk to\nme again.  
  
    #org @msg2  
    = I say this right after our battle\nno matter what!

Surge mentions that electric Pokemon saved his life in the war but we never heard anything more about this ""war"".  So now, tackling the league and whatnot.  Except he's followed and periodically checked up on by Government officials (although you don't know that at the time) to test his skill.  

Upon becoming league champion you are approached by these officials who reveal themselves to you and tell you that the Kanto region is preparing to invade and declare war on your region.  They want you, so you take command as general of your region, working with the elite four, gym leaders, and notable trainers.  Again this long battle continues and some story elements take place that I'd like to keep secret (These tie the story together).  The idea is you stop the war between your region and kanto, and usher in an era of peace in the world once more.

War takes place as once reference by Lt. Surge in Gen 1.  You become champion and general leading your region with a secondary motive to bring peace between both sides.",,t5_2t5aw,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/1kbep6/do_you_know_of_any_hacks_with_this_storyline/

1341769703.0,w881i,XSE Tutorial 3 - Give Pokémon and Flags (Part 2),BHLHB3,10,2,45,"##Preface

This tutorial was originally intended to be part of the [previous tutorial](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/vx9ji/xse_tutorial_2_give_pok%C3%A9mon_and_flags_part_1/) however due to the Reddit character limit I couldn't fit it in a single post so they were split up into two and I've expanded on a couple of points. If you haven't gone through the previous tutorial you're going to have a bad time so go back to the second tutorial if you have skipped it or feel you need to reacquaint yourself with any of the commands covered there.

The aim of this tutorial is to create a 'perfect' version of the givepokemon script we created in the second tutorial whilst covering Yes/No msgboxes and the gosub and call commands. It's a very quick a dirty tutorial

As always if you have any questions

---
#Section 1 - Comments

I apologise again for starting with a boring topic but this is a quick one and it's pretty damn useful. You'll notice from this point onwards the example scripts are a little more complex and a lot longer. One of the useful features of XSE is that it has a great commenting system. Comments are small snippets of text that you can use to place reminders next to lines of code that won't be compiled. 

There are two types of comments: block comments which allow a comment to span multiple lines and in-line comments which are restricted to a single line and usually follow the command. 

Block comments start with /* and end in */.

    /* This whole block
    is commented
    as an example */    

There are three variations of inline comments **'**

    #org @example
    msgbox @1 0x2 'This produces a messagebox for the player with lock and faceplayer
    givepokemon 0x123 0x5 0x44 0x0 0x0 0x0  //This gives the player a level 5 Scyther with a Rare Candy
    end ;This ends the script
    
---
##Section 2 - Notification

Let's start with a quote from the previous tutorial.

&gt;If you try and compile this script and run it you'll notice it seems rather awkward. You get no confirmation you received the pokémon and you can't even open up the Pokémon menu to check it's there! In fact the only indication the script is running 'correctly' is that the character you ran the script on will switch dialogues after talking to him once.

Despite the fact the player receives the pokémon -- the player doesn't receive any confirmation that they did. This is bad practise for any type of scripting, and you get the option to nickname it. 

To emulate this we're going to modify our previous script this time so that that a message appears when the player receives the Scyther, such as the nicknaming script, while our script is running. It might help to have a copy of the original script from the last tutorial for comparison.

    #dynamic 0x800000
    #org @givepokemon
    checkflag 0x100
    if 0x0 goto @give
    msgbox @2 0x2
    end
    
    #org @give 
    msgbox @1 0x2
    givepokemon 0x7B 0x5 0x44 0x0 0x0 0x0
    fanfare 0x13E //Plays the player received pokemon fanfare
    msgbox @notify 0x4
    waitfanfare
    closeonkeypress 
    setflag 0x100
    msgbox @qname 0x5 //Asks the player if they want to nickname their pokemon
    compare 0x800D 0x1 //Checks to see if the player selected 'Yes'
    if 0x1 gosub @nickname //If yes then the @nickname script will run and then return
    msgbox @3 0x2
    end
    
    #org @nickname
    call 0x1A74EB //Calls the script responsible for nicknaming the pokemon
    return //Forces the script back
    
    #org @1
    = Please take care of my Scyther for me.
    
    #org @2
    = How is my Scyther doing [player]?
    
    #org @notify
    = [Player] received SCYTHER!
    
    #org @qname
    = Would you like to give SCYTHER a\nnickname?
    
    #org @3
    = I hope you take good care of it
    
There's a lot of new commands and msgbox types and the script is getting pretty big so let's just look at the portions that are changed

|Command|Usage|Example|
|:--|:--|:--|
|fanfare|Interrupts the in-game music to play a sound|sound 0xNUMBER|
|sound|Plays a sound without interrupting the in-game music|sound 0xNUMBER|

The first new command is **fanfare**
fanfare. A full list of the fanfares and jingles you can use with the fanfare command can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ROMhacksLibrary/comments/w7phf/fanfare_codes/). The msgbox after the fanfare is not one we've come across before. If we venture back to tutorial one we learnt that msgbox **0x4** was the same as 0x6 except that it didn't automatically close when another command was used. We can use this in combination with the command **waitfanfare**

|Command|Usage|Example|
|:--|:--|:--|
|compare|Compares the value of an offset to a desired result|compare 0x800D 0x1|
|gosub|Goes to another part of the script but returns after the offset ends|gosub @OFFSET| 
|call|Calls another script **whilst* your script is running and then returns|call @OFFSET|
|return|Tells the script when to return always used with gosub and call|#org @example fanfare 0x100 return|

We also use another kind of new msgbox, either yes (0x1) or no (0x0),  is stored in the location **0x800D**. The **compare** command looks up the pointer 0x800D and compares the command either to 0x1 (yes) or 0x0 (no). The shortcode 'LASTRESULT' can be used in place of 0x800D.

The **if** command then does the same thing it did previously, the script would execute @nickname but when @nickname ends it would go back and continue from @give.

@nickname uses the **call** command which executes a piece of script elsewhere in the ROM. The offset it's using, in this case msgbox @3.

---
##Section 3 - Perfecting the Script

We're very close to having a perfect

**Fixing the Pokémon menu not appearing**  
If we recall the end of the last tutorial we learnt that some flags have special effects. One such flag

**Fixing the player having a full party**   
This is another easy fix. The command **countpokemon** counts the number of pokemon there are in the players party and stores the value at 0x800D. We can then use the compare command

A small sample of script that would count the number of pokemon might look like:

    #dynamic 0x800000
    #org @count
    countpokemon
    compare LASTRESULT 0x6 //Checks the LASTRESULT variable (0x800D) to see if there are 6 pokemon
    if 0x1 goto @full
    msgbox @1 0x2
    end
    
    #org @full
    msgbox @2 0x2
    end
    
    #org @1
    = You have a spare pokémon slot in\nyour party!
    
    #org @2
    = You have a full pokémon party!

---
##Section 4 - Extension

To check your knowledge of tutorial two and three try producing one of the following scripts and posting them as a reply.

* Produce a 'perfect' givepokemon script. (Includes the Pokémon menu and full party fixes)
* Produce a 'perfect' givepokemon script that offers the player a choice to receive the pokémon or not.

Now, this entry in the guide is meant to go over the basic parameters of scripting.

Now, here is a nice free dynamic offset for Fire Red (the first 256 byte open space after the beginning of the ROM).

&gt;   #dynamic 0x71A300

Don't worry about having to create your own offsets because here's a handy [link](http://toolsfactory.googlecode.com/files/FreeSpaceFinder-2.0.1.0.zip) to get HackMew's FreeSpaceFinder

Next, but if you have multiple scripters who have to know what each script is supposed to do, it's useful to have meaningful pointer names like ""@givepikachu"". However, as always, the trusty ""//"" before a line gives you comments.

So
&gt;    #dynamic 0x71A300

&gt;    #org @start

Now, ""lock"" must be paired with a ""release"" command, all before the ""end"" command is used.

Let's make our friendly NPC tell our hero/heroine that Prof. Oak's house is north of here.

&gt;    #dynamic 0x71A300

&gt;    #org @start

&gt;    faceplayer

&gt;    lock

&gt;    msgbox @profoaknorth 0x6

&gt;    release

&gt;    end

&gt;    #org @profoaknorth

&gt;    = Hey

That was a lot of information to throw at you, and the offset tells the script what kind of language it's using. 0x6 is normal speech. 0x5 is a yes/no question (we'll get more into this later). 0x4 is a text box that closes when a button is pushed. 0x3 is for signs. 0x2 is  for people as well, but with the special attribute of not having to use ""lock"", ""faceplayer"" or ""release"" commands. Hooray!

In the text, \n shows the first line break. After the first line break, \l must be used. \p will be used when you want the next text to be shown in a new text box, and that's that. Also [rival] can be used for your rival's name.

Basic overview of the project:
The player recently moved to the Alvena region where the journey begins as the player sets out to become a pokemon master. The player soon find out a sinister plot brewing by Team Infiniti (cwutididthar?) that could change the fate of the entire Alvena region. Along the way many different sites are still waiting to be discovered along with some new pokemon. 
Note: I am trying to keep the story as vague as possible because it IS in its alpha stages

Spots that need filled:
I need a couple of staff to help me out the positions are as follows

Graphics Artist- For designing new pokemon

Cartographer - Someone skilled with designing fluid and adventurous pokemon maps that will leave a lot to be discovered

Beta Testers - People to test out the game itself

All pokemon will be catchable in these games.

We might support Trading and LAN gameplays eventually.

Starters = Elekid, and Seedot (yes we know they aren't like the normal starters)

We decided to have the starters different then other games because we will have you able to catch ALL 500+ pokemon from all the series

Gyms: Gyms will not be used for the traditional uses we will have something like earning money or getting special pokemon from the gym leaders so you won't need them to continue the story.

Regions = Kilos *Athis* Humorons *Skelos*
We will have two different regions for both games but you will be able to go to each region.

The typical event pokemon is just its dex number -- 0x9701 for Latias, and it still spawns Latios.

I then thought maybe it was just some modification based on Latias's number (+1 for example)

Of note are the few bytes after Latias's location: 0x3A4801. If you try changing the 0x34 or 0x48, you change that 0x01 (to 0x02, for example), choosing BLUE makes a wild Latias appear instead of Latios. Furthermore, changing Latias's value still makes a Latias appear for BLUE when you do this, so it's not tied to Latias's value at all.

About pokemon open and closed:

Hypothetical game design has been a hobby of mine for a while: [1] /r/lolchampconcepts and [2] NEMEP, I got the idea to ""hypothesize"" my own pokemon game. Feel free to contribute ideas and criticize! I expect myself to fail, Especially when it comes to wording and structuring the whole thing.

Well then

Summary of plot idea:

Both games have a somewhat opposed message: pokemon open is about that information should be shared, and technology has been developed that allows humans to be put into capsules just like pokemon. This doesn't quite allow for catching humans, but in each game, a different use is found: In pokemon open, humans can be healed to perfect health, like pokemon. In pokemon closed, humans can be transported through the PC system, in both cases, since it's bloody pokemon. Another difference between the games would be the roles of mister oppan and mister dichson: dichson is the corporate fat cat in pokemon open, you will at first battle the protestors who will be doing douchey things like raiding research facilities and messing with cabling

Setting:

An region with huge futuristic cities in the middle of huge swathes of undeveloped land. The cities are legitimately enormous

Fakemon:

Of course

Every grass starter has been somehow based on ancient animals! My grass starters are based on the evolution from feathered dinosaur to flying dinosaur!

/#005 Shinobbit (Shinobi + rabbit)

/#006 Harekness (Hare + darkness)

Fire/dark

A hare, except for some stripes and the flame-like bunny tail.

/#007 Pinchy (Semi-diminutive of pinch by adding -y

Water

Torrent / dw: arena trap

*Is set in a new region named Junnin
*The professor's name is Pine
*The three starter Pokemon are the Small-Leaf Pokemon Eucuwala (A highly social green koala bear Pokemon, with speed orientated stats), and the Fin Pokemon Dimetrus (An aquatic dimetrodon Pokemon, with defensive orientated stats). 
*The main villainous team of the region is named Team Zodiac, and scientists, is split into 12 sub-admins based off of the western zodiac and a main admin, based and named after Ophiuchus. They are after the legendary Pokemon Orakey, said to hold all of the answers to the universe. The sub-admins appearances, personalities, and type speciality (if any) are based off of their respective zodiacs. For example, specialize in Water and Ice type Pokemon

This would be a FireRed hack, either male or female.

**PLOT**


The Player Character would be a young boy/girl from Goldenrod City who comes to this as-of-yet unnamed region to participate in the new League challenge

Judging by all those adjectives, and above all, a blast to play. Every Pokémon, including Legendaries, would be obtainable (Many during the main story line), and it would feature both Team Rocket and a new villainous team as well, most likely sun-themed (Team Sol, mostly unchallenged save for you

The version mascot would be Celebi.



**THE REGION**

This region's terrain would be wildly varied, Gyms, towns, and a few special areas where you could challenge some very special (and strong) Trainers to battles.

**Edit 2:** This is now **solved**! KazoWAR added a real-time clock editor to their [save file editor](http://projectpokemon.org/forums/showthread.php?31254-A-Save-(3rd-Generation-Save-Editor)). I used it to reset the 2 time stamps (adventure started and time passed)

===

This is a question for all you awesome people working with ROMs. I have been trying to get my GBA games whose batteries had run dry working again. I have successfully replaced the batteries but time-based events still do not occur. While it is only mentioned rarely

Does anyone of you people who work with all kinds of stored values in the ROMs know how/where the game stores the information that time-based events do no longer occur? I have loaded my save files from my GBA cartridges to the PC and checked them

When I loaded my GBA save onto the PC and loaded it in Visual Boy Advance with the clock working

So I thought maybe one of you experts already knows what to do in this situation. All I want to do is change the part in my save file that says whether time-based events are on or off

I have looked in the PokéCommunity forums but there are so many threads there

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Basically, all his Pokemon at level 100. Why? Well, this special Arceus you face (not the one you get) would have 250 base stats straight across the board plus a new ability called Omnipotence

Omnipotence works like Multitype, plus immunity to damage from Hail and Sandstorm, plus immunity to all status conditions, including Flinch, Infatuation (...although being genderless it kind of already is...), and Confusion

Thing is, but it acted a bit funny, allowing Soak to work while leaving the type Dragon (although I suspect that was Judgement working off the Plate instead of off of Arceus' type)

1354665058.0,14ah05,XSE Tutorial 6: Money,PunsAreFun,8,2,4,"Welcome back! Today's tutorial is going to cover how to give
**What You'll Need**  
XSE (I use version 1.1.1)
 ---  
**Section 1: Give and Pay Money**  
The code that XSE uses for giving money is:  
`givemoney 0xHEX_NUMBER 0x0`  
Let's go over what it means!   


| Code | Description |  
|:--: | :-- |  
|givemoney| The code XSE uses to give a player money|  
|0xHEX_NUMBER| The amount of money
|0x0| This is a buffer
Here's an example:  
`givemoney 0xA 0x0` will give the player 10 yen.  
To take money from a player is pretty much the exact same thing only instead of ""givemoney"" you'd say ""paymoney"".  
Here's an example:  
`paymoney 0xB 0x0` will take 11 yen from the player.  
  
---  
**Section 2: Check Money**  
Check money is used primarily to stop a player from being able to buy something if they don't have enough money. For example:  
    `checkmoney 0xHEX_NUMBER 0x0`  
    `compare 0x800D 0x1`  
    `if 0x4 goto @Next`  
    `msgbox @NeedMoreMoney 0x6`  
But what does this all do?  

| Code | Description |  
|:--: | :-- |  
|checkmoney| Checks to see what the hex value is.
|compare 0x800D 0x1| Compares the amount of money you have with the hex value.|  
|if 0x4 goto @Next| If your money is greater than or equal to the hex number then go to the method titled @Next.|  
|msgbox @NeedMoreMoney 0x6| If your money was less then the hex number
That's all there is to it!  

---  
**The Challenge**  
Your challenge is to write a script that will take away 3000 yen only if you have more than 5000. Post your answers in the comments!

Years later his dream is to take revenge against Giratina.  The team bad guys would be a cult that worships Giratina.  The elite four would instead be Giratina's 4 generals, it would be Giratina and each of it's pokes would be a different form of it, like hi-powered grass/ghost, fire/ghost, water/ghost and so on, all different forms of Giratina.

When I decided I was done hacking I was right in the middle of porting the GBA cart recognition system from the gen 4 games to the gen 5 games.(You know how you could attach a GBA cart to your DS to PalPark and change wild encounters. That.) I had it working, what I ended up doing was coding a couple of my own script commands(written in assembly and inserted as a script command so that I can call them like normal script commands in scripts) in empty script command slots and what they would do is poll an address I chose for specific values which would change depending on which GBA game was in slot-2 on the DS. Different values would change the weather and seasons and stuff just as a test. It seemed to work fine as far as I could see. I also tried out changing encounter tables as the GBA games changed. That seemed to work fine too.

Anyway, I can show someone else how to do this. If there's anyone who knows some ARM assembly and is interested in making a hack and wants to do something neat with GBA carts, I can walk you through it. If you can write your own routine that calls other routines and insert it, that's probably enough experience. You could even make an importer for the gen 3 games so people don't have to PalPark then Poketransfer. They could connect up their GBA cart and certain pokes would be automatically converted and show up in the gen 5 games. These are just random example ideas, though.

Ok so the other idea I had was a dynamic weather system for all of Unova. There's a timer in the field data block that tracks how long you've been in a given area since you last went through a door. You could easily measure that and every x ticks(a few minutes or whatever) see if the weather should change. Changing the weather is super-easy. You would need some semi-complex code to check whether you're indoors or out, etc etc. Then you could count vframes to see how long the weather should run with a random number thrown in to make it a little unpredictable. Something like 300 vframes(5 min) - rand(120) vframes which would run the weather anywhere from 3-5 minutes. That's just an example though.

Long story short, if you know some ARM and think this is something you might be interested in, let me know.  I'd love to help.",Technical,False,,t5_2t5aw,,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/1fk7k7/white_2_hack_ideas_and_implementation_help/

I am in the initial planning stage of creating my own pokemon game. I came up with the ideas in the comment section on someone's theory on /r/pokemonconspiracies. I am just going to copy and paste my original comments. I'm not doing this to be lazy, and not just the summarized conclusion of it. Quoted, bolded text are other user's comments, not mine.

______________________________________________________________________________________________

Come to think of it

&gt; **Hoenn has a pretty ""south american"" type climate.**

Yes

You would start the game as a young boy/ girl who moved to the region (I'm just going to call it Region X for now) with your uncle

Of course, you encounter Team Rocket. This isn't the same Team Rocket Red faced years ago, but rather a revival of the group lead by someone other than Giovanni. This Team Rocket came to X to once again clone Mew, attempting Mewthree. There will be another villainous team, and from here on they will be referred to as Team Y. I'm not sure on what Team Y's motives will be, but they will be against both you and Team Rocket. Team Y will also be an aboriginal group.

&gt; **10/10 would buy. You should look into rom hacking. As cheesy as rom hacks are..**

I would rom hack, actually name Region X, name Team Y, and give Team Y a story.
I think I'll call the region Gyoka.

The grass starter will be some sort of gorilla pokemon. The fully evolved one will be Grass/Fighting. I'm not sure about the water and fire starters yet.

One Pokemon will be Bozbig. It'll be a grass and fighting type as well, but it will use nature to camouflage, ie hiding under leaves. If you haven't already figured it out, Bozbig is a homage to Big Boss, or Naked Snake, from Metal Gear Solid 3.
The game will take place about 10 years after the Johto journey. After the Elite Four are defeated, in the vein of finding Red in gen II. Gold will have a different role than Red: He will actually talk. He'll point out a reference to him battling Red years ago, and after you beat him, he will explain something previously unknown in the game, probably something referring to Mewthree, or something.

The white inhabitants of Gyoka will not be natives, or they missed the boat before it left. Some people will be vacationers from other regions, as well.

Similar to Kanto's towns being named after colours, Tv series, and games set in South America, or other jungle settings. One town will be Melgeer, which would be derived from Metal Gear. Of course in that town you'll be able to catch Bozbig. (Speaking of Bozbig, I am planning another Metal Gear based Pokemon. I haven't figured out a name, but it'll be based off of Raiden from MGS2. It will evolve into Raiden from MGS4 and MGRising. The first one will be a fighting type

Perhaps after the Elite Four are defeated, and maybe even go to Johto. Hoenn, even.

______________________________________________________________________________________________

Yeah, or are replies to mine. If anyone has any input they want to share, don't hesitate. 

Thank you for reading this. If anyone wants to help in any way

_______________________________________________________________________________________________

**Update**: Another Metal Gear reference. I know, there will be an NPC named Snake. If you talk to him, he'll say he's on a sneaking mission, and not to bother him. He will then mutter under his breath that a cardboard box would be useful. You here this, and you give him a box you find in another town. Upon giving the box to him, an exclamation mark will appear over his head, Metal Gear style. Snake will thank you, or a rare candy

Maybe Bozbig and the Raiden-based pokemon will be legendaries. Im jot sure exactly what I'm doing with them yet

________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Update** MGS2 Raiden should be just a Fighting type

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Update** Help wanted. Spriters, I'll pretty much accept any help.

Also

________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Update**: When you battle Gold, a road block. Gold will have a Sudowoodo, too. Oh, Togepi. How could I forget that little fucker. I guess it would be a Togechick. I mean, little Togepi is no threat at all. Eevee? It would be an Umbreon, because Red had an Espeon, didnt he? ",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/wjvov/the_gyoka_region/

Also could we nickname them? we want to keep the same pokemon (We're going to make a story about the generations being passed down from father to son

2. Redesign the sprites of the characters. We want to give everyone a tribal-like look (native American / native African).

3. We're having a problem with advancemap where we cannot use til sets from other towns for different towns. We want to use the pacifidlog and fortree huts for many of the towns

4. We want to make the pokemart guy the same person as the nurse. It would be one person in one hut. Is there any program to do this? We want to make it a shaman

5. This one is kind of complicated and unnecessary, We would like the Exp. share to have a different graphic (a stone bracelet) and be able to double the experience and split it (so instead of one pokemon getting 100 exp, or two gettign 50, they would both get 100).

--A lab-created Pokemon inspired by Mewtwo himself has escaped. This Pokemon has proven stronger and smarter than Mewtwo, and recently reached the age of 13, at which point most of your people make their choice- stay and become Pokemon Trainers on Elysium, or leave and become Pokemon Trainers on your own. You will leave, on the mission to prevent humanity from suffering the wrath of Praetium, the Perfect Form, in its bloodlust against humans. You choose your Elysian Starter- Felign, Solseed, a water-type skeletal-quadruped Pokemon which will become water-ghost. As you advance, the Ghost of Elysium

There are others, thus ending Mewtwo's rampage. I also have one in which the Pokemon Champion of a region wants to let one of the Team Rocket equivalents take it over, and one in which you are a member of Team Rocket trying to overthrow Giovanni.

* You and your best friends, and instantly the rivalry begins. Barry wants a battle with you, and you accept. After battling you, he immediately turns to face Andria. After losing to her, Barry becomes very angry and storms out of the Lab. As you work your way through the gyms and the game, you come to learn that Barry has joined Team (still thinking of a name), and is dedicated to becoming stronger to beat you and Andria. What Barry doesn't know is that Team (?) is only training with him to use him. Jirachi awakens once every 1, and the next recorded date for it to awaken is very near. Barry's secret purpose is to capture Jirachi

* Starters: Bagon
* The region the game takes place in is Enora

1353810743.0,13qpud,XSE Tutorial 5: Items,PunsAreFun,9,1,2,"PunsAreFun here again for the wrap up of the basics of XSE. Today's topic covers items
**What you'll need**  
Advance Map 1.92  
XSE (I use version 1.1.1)
 ---  
**Section 1: The Code**  
The code XSE uses for items is:  
`giveitem 0xHEX 0xQUANTITY MSG_FIND`  
Let's run through what these mean:  


| Code | Description |  
|:--: | :-- |
|giveitem|This is what tells XSE you want to give the player an item.|  
|0xHEX| This is the hex code of the item you'll be giving. A complete list of hex codes for Fire Red can be found [(in the video description) here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP_JPGznDS8)|  
|0xQUANTITY| This is how many of the item you'll be giving.|  
|MSG_FIND| This is what tells the game to show the ""My_name got an item"" kind of message and sound
Here's an example:  
    `#dynamic 0x800000`  
    `#org @main`  
    `giveitem 0x136 0x1 MSG_FIND`  
    `release`  
    `end`  
That's it for the code but we're not done yet! When you place the Pokeball icon (or whatever you choose to denote an item) you have to assign it a unique Person ID in Advance Map [like so.](http://i50.tinypic.com/15yhmvk.png)  This is what causes the Pokeball to disappear forever after you obtain your item!  

---  
**Section 2: NPC Giving Items**  
When a NPC gives you an item you're going to use the exact same code as above except instead of MSG_FIND you'll be using MSG_OBTAIN. You also do not need to worry about a Person ID in this case. The code in the example doesn't come with any messages so you'll have to use the knowledge you have from past tutorials about message boxes to give the NPC something to say! Remember

So far I have downloaded AdvanceMap, free space finder and an appropriate ROM. What else do I need?

If it helps, which apparently advancemap has problems with, will I need to create the artwork for that myself in an extra program?

As much as I liked this concept, but I think the dialogue could have been better. So here's my idea.

I would like to remake it. Well, I'm not *that* guy. 

The only part I would sort of copy is the fact that your rival is friendly, so I might use that. 

I just think it would be cool if I made a hack where you and your rival are chosen by Oak to build a team that could contest

Here's my problem:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have almost *NO* experience with hacking

My solution to my lack of experience is to make a really basic hack that is basically changed dialogue with some extra battles here and there, I would add some more complex events, perhaps some secret Rocket hideouts, the ideas are only limited by my imagination...and yours. This would keep up until we've built one big hack with a more complete ""dark"" storyline.

What do you guys think? I'm going to need some help

*The Plot*

They finally did it! Professor Birch and the scientists in his lab finally tracked down the coordinates for unique Pokemon! *(can either be Fakemon or Fusions from [here](http://pokemon.alexonsager.net/)) (yes, Professor Birch trips and is encountered by a Zigzagoon. Suddenly (blah blah blah RSE plot) Brendan/May come to the rescue and send out Birch's ferocious Pokemon. Birch is scratched all over and has to be taken home for hospitality. Mesmerized at Brendan/May's performance, Prof. Birch says Brendan/May is deemed the one to catch the unique Pokemon, (the rival gets jealous) but in order for the Pokemon to appear, the Trainer needs to beat the Hoenn Champion, since the Champion is the one who had created the prized Pokemon in the first place.

In RSE the player has quick access to wingull at levels 5-7 so make Mist available right then because it clears stat changes. I was thinking the core starter types could have two tiers of stat clearing moves

OR

 Without altering any moves

Pros

New importance of X items, Clear Body, Speed Boost, Battle Armor, Contrary, Magic Bounce, Hyper Cutter
More strategic depth in team building in regards to offense vs defense 
Battles that take more attempts could spike in difficulty or become easier


Cons

All stat changes have to be visible like in pokemon showdown
Lots of work to script and balance.
Players could abuse and return to easier areas and boost theirs stats off of weak Pokemon.
Boxing Pokemon and healing Pokemon cannot reset stats.
Could get insanely difficult.

I am working on a FireRed hack, but now you've come to him from Johto to prove yourself. At first your only goal is to become an adept Trainer worthy of his respect, but as you wander around the region you begin to uncover a plot that involves the Legendary Bird Trio, Mew and Mewtwo, and several other Indigo League tidbits.

You have two rivals. One is Gary Oak, who is trying to stop you. Along the way you will bully, lie, and steal your way through Kanto on your quest first to defeat everyone in it, then to gather the Trio, then to capture the elusive genetic experiment that got away.

All Pokemon are first gen. Instead of Shinies

Obviously there is a lot more to it. I suppose what I'm looking for is a collaborator, but I need someone to help edit the map a little bit, etc.

But really

The game would freeze, the image would become a negative, and it would crash. I had been dedicated and used few save states, so my closest one to that point was from before I received the Toxicroak; which was too far for me.
