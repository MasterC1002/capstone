That is why I decided to make it my personal goal to buy 1, it's gone pretty well; I've purchased about 100K #bots up to this point. However, my sources are very shady characters from places like Pakistan and Moldova.  I can't in good conscious keep buying what I can only assume are #BloodBots.

That is why I am coming to Reddit for help.  I'm looking to recruit someone out there to build me an army of non-conflict #bots for cash. I figure an enterprising young American hacker can do just as well as some jerk in Moldova. 

Granted

Thank you.

1.  If/when you submit
2.  Your account is older than a day or two.
3.  You've submitted and/or commented in the past.

Some of you have noticed we've been having some trouble with posts that look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/wgmME.png) and [that.](http://i.imgur.com/KNIoc.png)  We get about two to five dozen of those posts a day.  While our [spam filter](http://i.imgur.com/Y2FRg.png) picks up most of them, I'm considering a few alternatives to discourage those posts (including moving toward temporary approved-submitter systems during a few hours of the late-evening/early-morning).

1334067926.0,s2k1s,Here are my best Twitter tips and tricks. What are yours?,atleroge,21,5,11,"1. Make lists. In particular make a list of ""people you know in real life.""  This starts to make twitter a little bit more like FB (in a good way). 

2. Use a program like [TweetDeck](http://tweetdeck.com) to monitor multiple twitter streams. For example a you can follow all four of these on the screen at the same time: 1. a particular # topic, and 4. your own tweets.

3. Use [Twitter Karma](http://dossy.org/twitter/karma/) to check who you are following who isn't following you back. They can be sorted by number of followers

4. Do cool shit in life and tweet about it. Go to concerts and tweet at the band and at the venue that the show rocked. Or explore abandoned buildings and tweet a picture of some urban decay. Or make a 3D print at a local fabrication studio and tweet a picture of it.

5. Tweet good articles that you find on Reddit at experts in the respective field. You can find prominent twitter figures in any subject at [Wefollow](http://wefollow.com/).

6. Tweet funny one-liners that come into your head. Especially late at night when drunk. These are some of the tweets that get the most attention.

7. Use [Klout](http://klout.com/). Seriously

**Quick way to pick up a bunch of followers:** Find a twitter person who is a real life friend of yours who is popular and smart and cool but hasn't been on twitter very long and only has about 100 followers. Go follow all the people who follow them. About 20 people will follow you back. Keep following the ones who followed you, but it seems ethical to me as long as you don't unfollow the users who followed you back. Only unfollow the people who didn't follow you back. What do you think?

I have a couple of questions I hope you guys can answer:

How should you handle the accounts of the apps or companies you use?
Like, what's the point to follow them back? Usually, I tweet at them only if something is not working and I'm looking for help...

I wouldn't mind following them and putting them in a list, the first thing I'll be seeing is my primary feed, not a defined list I want primarily and I would of course get the entire tweets of everyone...


What should I be doing with the accounts of magazines or blogs if I already have them in google reader? it's redundant... (and while we're on the subject, google+ and facebook and why do they want you to follow them everywhere so badly? shouldn't they be using each service differently???)


How do you connect with people you don't know


Just so we're clear, how should I use twitter to get the most out of it for me? No matter how I look at it, I can't figure out how or if I should mix the type of stuff i'm sharing (in my case startups/web dev/ web design and ""men lifestyle &amp; fashion) and how I should interact with the twitter world beyond just sharing stuff.... like how can you possibly build little by little a following of two types of different people who decide to follow me for different reasons? tweeting in french and english on the same account for instance... doesn't seem like a good idea....

I am resorting to somewhat organizing them manually by searching for certain accounts or keywords with the Find function in my browser and then un-Favorite-ing and/or clicking through a link and just adding it to my browser bookmarks.

I would totally resort to doing this manually for Favorites I know go back years but at a certain point

I read that Favorites is just rudimentary that way and that there have been third-party sites aimed to help but not anymore.

My dream for this function consists of:
*first of all
*being able to filter tweets that had links
*being able to search for Favorites from specific accounts
*being able to group Favorites by the accounts in which Lists you have or just manually (like an account could be in your List called ""Comedians"" but instead you then and there create a group called ""Comedians and Radio Hosts"" or something like that for your Favorites)

There's probably one or two things more.

I know exactly how it works, and add hashtags.  I'm even a web developer and have even developed Twitter integration into various websites where I've been employed.   I have great difficulty finding how I can make Twitter useful to me, or see how it could be useful to others.

So I guess what I'm looking for is a tutorial about Twitter which doesn't simply just show you how to use it

I also have a couple of questions for long-time Twitter users:

- What prior forms of communication

- Of all the people I follow, because most of them refer to previous conversations or things I'm simply not in on, and Twitter doesn't provide (or very rarely provides) any context to a Tweet, unlike online forums where you follow a topic.  A fair few of them are simply thanking people for retweeting him or mentioning him in a blog, or whatever - seems to have no actual ""content"" and nothing that I, who didn't read the blog post or see what was retweeted, can recognise. Should I simply not follow someone like that?  What can you do to figure out what is going on

- Why do mainstream media use it so much, you'd think it would not be tweets, which are limited to 140 characters and frankly look like a bunch of source code in a programming language I've never learned half the time - we have forums, things like Reddit, etc, which appear way more friendly.

I apologize for being behind the curve in terms of enabling this functionality, one of the moderators would update the style sheet for every user who has provided their Twitter account in the forum in order to connect with other redditors.  While the approach looks nice and I would generally add users to our Twitter list at the same time as a stylesheet update, it leaves the matter of how to edit, remove, or hide personal information out of the hands of the individual users.  

The old method also takes a bit of extra work on the part of the moderators to look up a user's Reddit ID number and then copy and paste the relevant information into the stylesheet.  I know that doesn't sound like much, it adds up.

So far, there were sixteen users who I could not account for in the stylesheet.  If your account still has the ""old flair"" that isn't editable, let me know and I'll change it.",,False,self,t5_2qhwg,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/qcnoz/flair_in_rtwitter_is_now_mostly_user_assignable/

First

There appears to be some [opposition](http://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/xkle8/request_for_the_mods_can_we_discourage_people/) to people posting solely to promote their Twitter profile and to ask for followers.  So

In addition, these can provide good insight.  However, they're typically just the same unoriginal crap everyone already knows.  So, no more generic Twitter tip posts.

Do you have other rules you'd like us to entertain?  Add them to the discussion!

Second

This subreddit is small.  We need more active members in order to really minimize spam or low-quality posts.  Even if someone makes it through with their crap post

So, then we'd have more new content and activity here to help minimize spam problems. 

We also need new members.  Here are some suggestions on how you can help with this:

* Do you blog?  If you mention Twitter or something Twitter-related

* Link to our subreddit from other Reddit posts.  As you comment around Reddit

If you have more ideas about promoting this subreddit

* No posts solely promoting your Twitter account or asking for followers.

* No generic Twitter ""tips"" blog posts",self,t5_2qhwg,False,,twitter-handle,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/xxrpp/town_hall_meeting_subreddit_rules_and_more/

A quick Google search for the problem and I stumbled onto this [Quora post](http://www.quora.com/Why-dont-my-tweets-show-in-hashtag-feeds). Here's the relevant part:

&gt; 1) Incomplete Bio:  
&gt; You might not have completely filled out your name and bio in your profile (so it might look like an account set up for spamming).

&gt; 2) New or Low Activity Account:  
&gt; You might not yet have tweeted much

Are they serious? I wasn't even aware there was a place to fill in the bio until after my first tweet and does Twitter really consider new or low activity accounts to be suspicious?

Why in the hell would I continue using the service if my tweets are only visible to myself? I guess Twitter assumes that people really want to use their service and will jump through whatever hoops needed to make things work.

I had an account for years, for my blog and naturally the tweets increased. At one point I was on my 60th tweet, within perhaps an hour, when the account suddenly got suspended. This was during a race I was updating on, btw.

I clicked the small link I got on my account and was told to reply to an email I received. I did. Nothing. Then after two and a half weeks, ""your account could have been suspended for aggressive following"", which I didn´t, my account was suddenly open again. Huzzah!

In the meantime I opened a new one

The pnly answer I get from Twitter´s automated reply ""service"", and at the same time, write to all these hundreds of accounts. I made 47 tweets last Sunday.

As I have been trying for over one month now to find ANYONE who has an answer to why this is happening, I really am interested in knowing what the hell is going on.

Before I get into the idea, you guys/girls are usually very clever, creative, and original, which is exactly what I'm looking for.

Now, but my true love is fiction. 

My idea is this; I would like to have people tweet me thoughts. Thoughts, random musings...basically what twitter is already used for. I would like them to send me things they would like to see a story made out of, or made around, or just to be included in a story. I am going to take some of these ideas and incorporate them all into a story (novel-length if this gets enough attention, but really any length will make me happy). 

The real catch is that I am also going to include the person who tweets the idea into the story

So basically, I use that person as a character in the very narrative involving zombie rehab.

My question to you redditors is this; how do I go about getting people to start tweeting me stuff? Do I just ask for it? Do I buy some ad space? Do I make reddit posts? I don't need millions of people participating

Or am I going about this all the wrong way? I've never used Twitter before

Any help you may provide will be rewarded. Maybe I'll send you a postcard. Maybe I'll write a sex-scene with ScarJo and you (or for the ladies


**TLDR** How do I get started on Twitter? With the end goal being to write a story using input from the public and the actual people who do the inputting.

I've done a lot searching and it seems that twitter does not keep a historical record of followers. So unless you've used a 3rd party service that records follower numbers there is no way to know how many followers you had on day 1 or day 365.
