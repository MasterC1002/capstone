Never mind these idiots used $400 worth of fireworks to get their explosives

 I was at the range the other day shooting my AR and I had a few people ask me where I got my ammo from. I told them I reload and I've had my supplies stockpiled for a long time now. One father son combo got really excited about this, telling them they should grab a book on reloading if they want to learn. Every time id start talking about safety the father would get annoyed. A bit later when they were getting ready to leave the range I could hear him telling his kid they were going to stop by a few stores to grab stuff to reload some ammo and how hard can it be. Today I was at cabelas grabbing a few things and swung by to see if they had any bullets in stock which of course they didn't. While I was browsing a fellow customer asked if I knew anything about reloading, he wanted to know if a press was really necessary, he could prime bullets using a hand primer, measure powder with a trickler and a scale but he was unsure of the crimp to keep the bullet in. He asked me if he could use vice grips to put a slight crimp on so the bullet wouldn't fall out. Normally id think the person was joking but he was an older gentleman and he looked serious. I think he could tell by my mouth gaping open that the answer was no, I told him absolutely not and he should really read up on reloading before he puts his first cartridge together and I tracked down a staff member to help him out and got out of there.

I sent Hodgdon this email:

&gt;Hello

&gt;I have read in some books, and cause a detonation as opposed to a rapid burn. Is this a possibility? Have there been any lab experiments of this occurring? Is this just a myth?

&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read and answer my question.

And I got this response:

&gt;This is a great way to identify those people on the internet and at the gun club who don’t know anything about reloading and specifically they don’t know anything about gunpowder.
 
&gt;Think about this a minute.  If we put x number of grains of powder into a case and we get the pressure in the case to be 10,000 PSI or would it be x grains minus 2 grains = 8,000 PSI?
 

&gt;I’ll point out that the laws of chemical energy storage and Newton’s laws have not been repealed.  They still apply.  According to the laws of physics and the laws of chemistry, the pressure cannot go higher, we would be creating energy.  If we were creating energy, we would be 2 things, 1) God because only God can create energy or 2) we would own and run the power company and take everyone’s money because we could make energy.
 

&gt;Obviously
 

&gt;What does happen is this:  When a load is too light,000 PSI jump up to 80,000 PSI just because the bullet is not moving as it should. 
 

&gt;This has NOTHING to do with “detonation”

I responded with this question based on the gentleman's response:

&gt;This is fantastic
 
&gt;A couple of questions about the possibility of the primer pushing out the bullet before the powder burns. How likely is that

And he sent this:

&gt;It is very likely that a primer will blow the bullet out of the case.  It is almost a certainty.
 

&gt;The problem comes when the loads are so light that the pressure remains very low in the case causing the powder to have trouble lighting and continuing to burn.  This allows the bullet to stop.

1323813053.0,nbiju,"What Happens After You Pull the Trigger, and What It Means For Reloading [FAQ]",,38,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/nbiju/what_happens_after_you_pull_the_trigger_and_what/
In many ways the process of reloading a cartridge begins before the previously loaded bullet is even separated from the not-yet-empty case.  After the trigger is pulled a series of mechanical and chemical processes take place in the cartridge and the firearm.  From a reloader's perspective these processes are both the final goal of a loaded cartridge *and* the initiator of changes that must be rectified before the empty case can yet again become a loaded cartridge.

**So what happens in the milliseconds following a trigger pull?**  

1. The trigger is pulled.  A spring-loaded mechanical lever called a *sear* is disturbed, on the other hand, combines the function of the hammer and firing pin into a single component.  In either case, the head of the striker/firing-pin is jammed forward through a hole in the bolt face and into the primer of the cartridge.

2. The primer (assuming Boxer type) consists of a thin metallic cup with a separate small metal anvil.  The firing pin slams into the cup, shooting a jet of super hot combustion gasses through the hole in the bottom of the primer pocket and into the body of the case.

3. The jet of gas ignites some of the powder in the body of the case.  The powder contains its own oxidizer

4. The powder begins to burn

5. As the diameter of the case is swelling, the back (head) of the case is stretched/pushed backwards until it contacts the bolt face, trapping the primer in the pocket.   On a necked cartridge, the front of the case and the bullet are stretched forward towards the bore, and the brass actually flows (similar to a swaging process) forward, elongating the front of the case.

6. The swollen case has a gas-tight seal against the walls of the chamber

7. The building pressure overcomes any crimping force on the bullet and begins to push it forward into the leade  (the distance between the case mouth and the beginning of the rifling).

8. The bullet has now been pushed out of the case mouth entirely and traversed the leade.  The rifling engages the sides of the bullet, and some of the unburnt powder has begun following the bullet into the bore.

9. With the swollen case blocking the breech end of the barrel and the obturated bullet blocking the muzzle

10. At this point two opposing conditions are affecting the pressure in the bore and the chamber.  Burning powder produces more combustion gasses

11. The bullet reaches the crown of the muzzle.  As it exits, creating a muzzle flash.  The rest burns up in the barrel.

12. Pressure inside the barrel now drops rapidly

13. Because the brass of the case was stretched beyond its elastic limit

14. The case is now free in the chamber again

**What does this mean for the reloader?**

1. First of all, and a necked cartridge is also probably too long as well.  Diametrical resizing can be done with dies through a swaging process, but a necked cartridge's lengthening must be rectified by trimming.

2. The pressure during the firing process is critical.  It must be high enough to stretch the brass and create that gas-tight seal around the chamber walls and the contact with the bolt face, or hot combustion gasses will vent through the primer pocket and ruin the bolt face.  Too much pressure and the gun blows up.  The correct powder/primer/bullet combination is crucial.

3. Necked cartridges undergo different forces than straight-walled cartridges.  They are pushed on from both sides

4. A case

6. In certain instances a case can be reshaped into another case through fire-forming... using similar mechanics to the above to reshape one type of case into another.  An example is forming 7.62x39 into 6.5 Grendel.  A forming die can get the trimmed parent case close,False,,t5_2rloq,False,,,t3_nbiju

Included in those images are shots of my new lighting for the Dillon 550b as well. The shot of the light up shell plate doesn't quite do it justice as my phone turned down the brightness of the shot

Details on the lighting:
The lighting system comes from Inline Fabrication

It's $34 and in my opinion well worth it. It adds an element of safety in reloading

Installation took about 15 minutes, and the plastic case is much thicker than necessary and can support a good sanding.

I think the only other thing I'd add to my system is a decently angled mirror to peer right down into the shell casing without having to angle my head. The more passive I can make it

I also just got a new Glock 34 recently

My wife and I visited a friend and were shooting at steel plates on his farm.  Near the end of the day I started practicing ""double taps"" with the 34.  I loaded up a mag with 17 rounds.  Everything was fine.  Gun running great.  Did 5 double taps successfully.  Grinning ear to ear that every pair of shots was clanging the plate.  

Finally

I knew something was up.  And I'm very very glad I didn't do a standard ""tap rack &amp; bang""

I dropped the magazine

Sure enough

Needless to say I was done shooting that gun for the day.  When I got home

I checked the load label and sure enough

One of the big lessons learned for me that I'd like to share is to ""know your gun.""  I've shot thousands and thousands of rounds out of Glocks and never had the slide just kind of ""pop back"" a bit.  The scary thing was that there was enough room to chamber a 2nd round. I didn't chamber a round

Sorry for my rambling.  Just remember when you reload you are accepting some risks. Know how your gun performs

After reloading and firing about 400 rounds of 40 S&amp;W I had a bit of an accident. The way it looks in the first couple pics is exactly how it was in my hands after the kaboom. Took some force to pry it from that form so I could lay out all the parts. The brass was laying off to the right and the top of the chamber was off to the left. All my digits remain and no one was hurt, but just always hoped it wouldn't. But now that it did, the hyper-rational part in me is wondering if I should give up reloading and stick to factory loads, and sell off my press/etc. The cost savings of reloading seem to just go to buying a new gun after you get a bad case or a double charge.

Well, aside from about three misfeeds near the very end of my shooting session. There wasn't much if any lube remaining on the cases since they'd been handled so much after sizing. But next time I will wipe them down with a cleaning solution before firing them.
The cases looked alright after firing too. Typical m1 soot pattern, a good start after daylight savings!


Also a fun occurrence today:
For a split second I thought my carbine had bought the farm.
A BIG fireball





&gt;Egads.
I was loading .30 carbine this week, I was accidentally eyeballing the 115 grain .30 carbine load data a few rows down the chart. I set my auto disk measure to throw 11.8 grains for what I thought was my correct bullet weight (it was supposed to be 14.0!). I noticed on the chart that the listed OAL for the 110 grain and 115 grain loads were different from each other, which made me double check again. Then I realized the extent of my error. So instead removing the bullets downrange into a paper target this weekend, I guess I'll be spending the afternoon pulling them in my press. Better safe than sorry!

I finally got around to testing them out.
[Here's what I ended up for expansion with the .30 carbine](http://i.imgur.com/4xPYujL)

We did two shots on a slow day at the range
The slug ended up going through about 4 water bottles (The small type) before exiting out the side of the box. One RSO said that he could actually see the second slug hit the grass

Unfortunately, and the meplat size, these don't cycle in this carbine (yet), so I had to chamber each cartridge manually. This is something that hopefully, I can work out by adding in another step to the making process, like a meplat trimming stage, or think of a way to make a very narrow hollow point type bullet completely encapsulated by jacket material. The 125 grain bullets chamber flawlessly in the test dummy rounds I made, only cast lead.

So far, and see how well I can group them at different distances. The feeding issue will hopefully be worked out in later revisions as well.

1369850577.0,1fa5ms,Results from a productive day of reloading. Reached 2/3rds of the Goal.,turnoffable,19,1,12,"We spent saturday reloading .45 acp.  The goal was to create 3000 rounds which would last us 6 months.  We got 2000 finsihed

All the rounds were made with 230 grain Berry's Plated Round nose bullets.  The first 1000 were made with 5.1 grains of Win 231 to get a fps of 850.  The 2nd 1000 were made with 4.5 grains of Win 231 to get a fps of 650-700.

The bucket of cleaned LPP .45 brass aparently wasn't all LPP.  Each time we hit a SPP it really slowed things down until we got a handle on what was going on.   At first look even those SPP brass looked like LPP.  Turns out all of the ones that got through were Federal.  For some reason the Federal SPP brass is harder to pick out than the other brands (like speer).

Shot showing the primer pocket difference..  LPP is .202"" and the SPP is .17x""

[LPP vrs SPP in federal cases](http://i.imgur.com/4Ka5CwE.jpg)

If a SPP got through it would cause multiple issues.  Before we ""got the feel"" of a SPP in the mix we would end up with a piece of brass with powder and a bullet crimped into it.  Since there is powder in the brass it was dumping some powder onto the plate through the empty primer hole which meant over time we would have to stop

We also were having some issues with the Brass feeder.  The LNL uses a pluger that goes up through a bushing and pushes a door type thing to let a piece of brass drop.  The bushing kept lifting up which would make the brass feeder not drop a piece of brass.  It wasn't consistant.  We finally fixed it by using some super glue on the outside of the bushing and its staying put now. 

The last issue we ran into was a bad primer.  Basically the primer came apart as it was put into the case.  My guess was it hit a SPP piece of brass.  It didn't pop but it came apart which got primer crap all over the place and we had to take the shell plate up again and clean up the mess. 

For those that have asked before

[Hornady LNL](http://i.imgur.com/73UzLzd.jpg)

Here are some finished shots.
First up is 1000 loaded rounds.  This is actually the 2nd 1000 as the first batch got boxed up in small boxes and then will be mailed across the country.   We were hoping to get 2000 finished in the 2nd batch to keep here but we only made 1000 in the 2nd batch.  We will make another 1000 in a month or so to keep.   

[2nd batch](http://i.imgur.com/d1RDm4x.jpg)

We load the 230 grain LRN and Plated RN bullets to an OAL of 1.260 which we have tried in in Ruger p90's

[OAL pic](http://i.imgur.com/d6MgvW2.jpg)

Overall it was a productive day.  When things were ""flowing"" we were on track for 600-700 rounds per hour.  When things were just not working it was closer to 250 rounds per hour.   That doesn't take into account the pre-setup and clean up time.

1.  the lee ""precision"" autodisc powder measure is not.  i've gotten up to a grain and a half difference reloading .308 with h4895 powder from one round to the next.  luckily, but i'm just making factory level ammo at that point, nothing close to match grade.  if i want to get precise, i still have to pull and measure every load.  it does seem to get more accurate with the finer grain pistol powder, though.  

2.  make sure you put your powder in your shell every time.  i was turning out some .40 for plinking, because when the primer only round went off, it just barely unseated the round, not enough to get it all the way out of the brass.  it completely locked up the gun.  but at the time, all i knew was that there was a struck primer on a live round in a barrel i now had to take to a gunsmith to get opened.  more than a little nervous.  

3.  glocks are not the only weapon with unsupported chambers, it's a hipoint.  it was cheap and it's fun to shoot.)  lee precision makes a bulge buster that will take care of that for you though.  you just need the lee factory crimp die to install it on.  

4.  just because the box of rifle projectiles says it has a .308 diameter does not mean it goes into any .308.  the 30-30 takes a .308 projectile, the cannelure is much higher on the projectile.  it bottoms out on the lands long after you reach the minimum OAL.  30-30 projectiles do not work in a .308win chamber.  (anybody wanna buy about 225 30-30 bullets?)

1333458122.0,rr3xk,Nu Finish car polish in the tumbler - WOW,twforeman,19,3,21,"All I can say is ""Wow.""

I stopped by the auto parts store to buy a new head light bulb for my truck and while I was there I remembered people on teh forums talking about putting Nu Finish car polish in their tumblers.

So I picked up a bottle. I figured even if it didn't work on my brass I could at least put it on my motorcycles.

I emptied the media out of my tumbler (it was nasty) and washed the bowl (also pretty nasty.) Then I filled it with new corn cob media and added about a cap full of Nu Finish.

I ran it for a few minutes to distribute the polish and then dumped in a bunch of .45 Colt and .45 ACP brass.

After about three hours I dumped the brass out. Holy crap did it look nice. It looks just like the new Starline brass that I bought.

I'm convinced. And a bottle of Nu Finish ought to last my lifetime (assuming I don't wash my motorcycles very often.)

I've been seeing a lot of posts recently asking questions that would be answered by just glancing in any one of the many reloading manuals that are out there.

**This scares me.**

It indicates that people are reloading without understanding what they are doing.

**THIS IS DANGEROUS**

Too much powder, not enough crimp, these are all dangerous conditions and they can cause your gun to go kaboom.

**The last thing you want is for your gun to blow up in your face.**

My advice to all new reloaders is to **STOP**. Step back from the press

*What's that you say? You don't have a manual?*

**GO GET ONE!**

Any manual: Hornady, The ABCs of Reloading. Pick one. Then read it.

Just watching YouToob videos is not enough. Sure

Absorb the knowledge. Get the 311. Whatever the kids are saying these days.

Seriously, maybe even worse, you are going to let your friend/girlfriend/spouse shoot some of your reloads and the gun will go kaboom and they will get hurt.

**Then how will you feel?**

I remember months ago I read about case trimming and thought it was super important. **Is it bad just to measure a couple in a batch and ""eye-ball"" the rest?**

* 3) Bullet weights part deux.  I've been playing around with different HPBT (168, but somehow 38.4g of Benchmark has higher velocity on 175 than 38g on 168. How does this relationship work?**
* 4) Bullet seating depth.  I've been using the ""Match the length up to  Hornady Match ammo I have"" method.  **What is the best way to determine the ideal bullet seating?** Do I need to buy calipers? How do I determine how far from the lans?
* 5) I'm currently half-assed ""logging"". **What are some best practices for keeping accurate logs?** What should I write down?


Thanks!

EDIT: Bonus story - I ran my first very first batch of 40 a month or two ago. It took me forever because I was figuring everything out/super paranoid.  I definitely winced the first time I pulled the trigger on my first reload, bullet still in case. Removed the bolt, checked the barrel. After letting it sit for an hour or so (for some reason I was convinced it was going to go off at any second) I took it home and pulled the bullet. Out comes the bullet..... with no powder.  I guess I checked the load to make sure the powder measure was still on and forgot to re-charge before seating.",,False,,t5_2rloq,,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/19rz9y/successfully_ran_through_my_first_several_batches/

Observations and notes: 

-I shot a handful of fouling shots using commercial 308. 

-My rifle didnt blow up. 

-I didnt get any signs of overpressure up to 45.5 gr of varget

-I had trouble getting through an entire ladder in the time between range stoppages. 

-I shot the first two ladders bottom to top

-I didnt notice much warming up of the barrel (considering i was shooting 5-6 shots / 25 minutes)

-I shot 42-45.5 gr in 0.5 gr increments

Results: 
[Here is the target for the first two ladders (the dot by the grains designates the 2nd ladder)](http://i.imgur.com/zjoBd.jpg). [This is the target for the third.](http://i.imgur.com/83OMQ.jpg)

I took these targets, it was really simple (read: fun) to get all the data out of it. [This image is the ladder tests separated into each cycle, and also stacked vertically] (http://i.imgur.com/SyFjt.png?2). 

These are the ladder vertical groupings centered around the grains indicated at the top

Conclusions??

-Best Vertical groupings at 44

-Best ""repeatable"" vertical grouping at 43.5

-Lowest MOA interladder at 44 gr.

-Lowest Vertical grouping interladder at 45gr (2nd place 44 gr).

-I think I should load at 44gr of varget

Questions:

- On a relatively low wind day

- On a handful of occasions, while a 43 gr charge exists the barrel as its whipping up.

Most people under-rate the effectiveness of the little zippity bullet, and the little VLD bullets are better than anything that is commonly available in .30 cal. However

**The .223/5.56 Myth**
I am going to go against conventional wisdom here

&gt;While there is a myth that 5.56 NATO cases are thicker and hence have less capacity than commercial .223 cases,000 psi) difference in pressure measurements. This means the NATO EPVAT maximum service pressure of 430 megapascals (62,000 psi) for 5.56mm NATO, is reduced by SAAMI to 379.21 megapascals (55,000 psi) for .223 Remington.[7] *In contrast to SAAMI, the other main civil standards organization C.I.P. defines the maximum service and proof test pressures of the .223 Remington cartridge equal to the 5.56mm NATO.*

The place and method that SAMMI uses to measure pressure is in a different place then where NATO measures pressure.

**Differences in .223 Remington Chambers**
There are a wide variety of chamber variations that vary mainly in the throat area. The ""NATO"" throat is the longest

The type of chamber that you choose should be based on your bullet choice.

**Bullet Selection**
 If you are shooting an AR15 with cartridges loaded to 2.260 (mag length)

If you are shooting a bolt action that allows you to feed longer rounds from the magazine, or the the NATO arrangement that is .100 longer. The extra length allows you to get more velocity out of the bullets, because if they are loaded to mag length, they will take away from powder space.

The twist rate of your barrel is also important to what bullets you can use. The common 1:9 twist is good for lightweight bullets up to the 69 grain class bullets. For a good all around rifle, then a 1:6.5 is advised.

**Powder Selection**
There are only 3 real options when it comes to getting stellar performance out of .223 Remington at distance, and H4895. Yes, you can get equal performance out of other powders, but these are commonly available, and are what sets the standard. I prefer Reloader 15 because it meters very well, and gives me the most velocity in a fairly temperature stable powder.


22-24 grains is where you will want to be with these powders for mag length bullets

Tumbler and media shipped together - it took about 1 day to get in the mail, UT. Reasonably quick shipping for such a heavy item.

**Packaging:**

StainlessTumblingMedia.com just took advantage of the packaging for the thumlers tumbler

**Price:**

I paid $245 for the tumbler, and shipping to CA. I did some research, and that price seems to be about as good as it gets. If I ordered the media from them separately, and tried to get the tumbler elsewhere, shipping ended up killing any deal I could find. If you are the maker type, you can buy the tumbler drum separate from the tumbling stand, but I am not sure there is any benefit to this (as the time/cost of making the motorized tumbling stand would need to be less than about $50). 

The lemi-shine is a necessary ingredient for the system, I wouldn't be afraid of stocking up on lemi-shine. Stuff smells amazing.

**Functionality:**

I have tried a vibratory tumbler with corn cob and various polishes, I tried every other recommended system before dropping the $250 for a stainless tumbler. NOTHING worked as well as the stainless does, and the stainless takes far, far less time. 

I use a postage scale ($20 @ Walmart) to weigh out 2 lbs of .45 ACP casings (about 160 casings, and screw on the top. This part of the process takes about 5 minutes.

Place the drum on the stand, really bad (like, left in a bucket on a range, mixed with steel casings, for 3 months, in the rain, under a tree that likes to drop flowers and seeds), or ""you just shot it"" brass)

Once you are done running the tumbler, and agitate it for a minute or two. The stainless pins are heavy enough that decanting off water, and separating them from the brass, takes little time.

At this point, inside and out. The product advertises that it cleans the primer pocket as well, and I have found that it does a good job of cleaning it out with large pistol primer sized pockets. They are never 100% perfect, but they are far, far better than any other method I have ever seen. StainlessTumblingMedia.com has plenty of before-and-after pictures of casings. I can confidently say those pictures are accurate. Your brass will actually look that good.

The stainless pins can be stored wet

There is some debate about how to dry the casings - whether using a hair dryer is best, I used a mesh bag from my camping gear. I placed all the soaking wet casings in the bag, and whirled it around outside for a minute, then hung it inside to dry. No fan, no hair dryer, no more electricity needed. The casings were perfectly dry in about an hour. I got my mesh bag at a local surplus place for a couple of dollars - I believe the brand was StanSport.

**Overall:**

Worth every cent. I tried every other cleaning method I could think of, the best. The casings come out cleaner than any other method, and it takes less time. It's about as noisy as your average clothes washer, so run it in your wash room or outside. The lack of toxic chemicals (like BC case cleaner), or acids (like vinegar - a whole other story), mean that you can be lazy, and leave your casings in the drum for a day without ruining a batch. The only consumables required are dish soap (I use Dawn), approx)

Go buy one!

**TL;DR:** Pictures at stainlesstumblingmedia.com are real, and always accept a new primer without a problem. Inside/outside of casings look like polished gold. Often, primer pockets are perfect. Spend the money to get the tumbler/media kit ($229 + tax, shipping) - its everything you need except dawn dish soap. Process takes about 3 - 5 hours from nasty brass, to perfect and dry brass. Stainless tumbling worked better than chemicals, ultrasonic, or vibratory tumbling. Go buy one!",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/q8d2g/review_of_stainless_tumbling_media_long/

I'm going to assume for the moment that cost is a factor. I'm also going to assume that you'll read a copy of the [ABC's of Reloading](http://www.amazon.com/ABCs-Reloading-9th-Rodney-James/dp/B0061Q6JEI/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323822235&amp;sr=8-14) and have [one](http://www.amazon.com/Hornady-Handbook-8th/dp/B004K5B5XC/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323822294&amp;sr=1-6)  (preferably [two](http://www.amazon.com/Nosler-Reloading-Book-NO/dp/B0011TA7LG/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323822382&amp;sr=1-1)) good load books on your shelf. IMO the best way to start is with the Lee Breech Lock Kits.  They contain nearly everything in a box.  You have two options:

[With auto-prime](http://www.midwayusa.com/product/121744/lee-challenger-breech-lock-single-stage-press-kit)

[without](http://www.midwayusa.com/product/423081/lee-challenger-breech-lock-single-stage-press-anniversary-kit)

Auto-prime is a hand-held priming tool;  I had one previously and didn't like it.  I prefer on-press because it reduces fatigue.  Others prefer the auto-prime because of increased feel.

Now

You're also going to need dies.  If you get a set of lee dies, one brand of dies are compatible with another brand of press;  they screw in and the threads are pretty standard unless you're doing something *really* exotic.

Lastly

With all that, primers and bullets of course (and eventually brass), just go with what your load book tells you. 

Also, every item I linked to.

**Misc Questions**

Q: What is meant by ""fast"" and ""slow"" powder?

A: Without going beyond the scope of this post


Q: I want to load for an M1 Garand.  Is there anything special I need to know?

A: **YES!**  The design of the M1 is such that it needs a very specific type of powder or you will damage the operating rod and maybe the receiver.  Stick with H4895 or IMR4895 until you get your feet wet.


Q: Can I re-use brass from that big crate o' Mosin ammo I got?

A: No.  The cases are made of steel which will tear up your press and dies.  Also


Q: Incompatible primers?  Can you elaborate? 

A: For pistol and rifle


Q:  Can I just fill my case to the rim with powder instead of measuring?

A:  Only if you have good insurance and don't mind having your firearm explode in your face.


Q: What is a ""Squib""

A: A Squib is when a bullet doesn't have enough force behind it form the burning powder to make it all the way out of the barrel, they can be tough to notice, so pay extra attention and **follow your load book to the letter**


Q:  Is it safe to deprime live primers?

A:  Generally.  Be extra careful and don't apply too much force!

Q:  My cases are difficult to resize!

A:  Make sure you're using lube!


Q:  My bottle-neck rifle cases are coming out with dents in the shoulder!

A:  Make sure that you aren't using too much lube


Q:  What's so special about carbide dies?

A:  Carbide dies are generally only available for pistol rounds and have a carbide ring inside of them to (supposedly) enable you to resize them without using lube.  Use lube anyway.

I had 2 hoppers that had powder in them that was like this.  Since both hoppers had the same powder from the same container I just emptied them into a clean mason jar to separate it from the 1 bottle of good stuff I have.

I reload .45 ACP

For context - the comment that I was replying to stated that he could buy cheap .45 ACP for $18/50 rounds. I replied that I can reload better ammo for $7/50 rounds and can produce 100 rounds an hour.

He then said:

&gt;You are faster then all of the people I've talked to about single stage presses. You can do match quality ammo at $7 for 50? Cheaper then I thought. I assume that's reusing brass. I tried saving brass for my brother to reload. Lasted 1 box of ammo
&gt;
&gt;Me? I value my time more then I value money. I'd much rather spend the $11 and spend an hour playing basement hockey with my 8yo son. I mean really

I bought 1000 pieces of .45 ACP brass for $60 when I started. I reclaim about 95% of my brass when I shoot. Some days I grab other people's brass (after asking if they reload) and come out ahead. .45 ACP is a low pressure round

Sure it's only $11. 

But if you shoot 100 rounds once a month that's a savings of $264 a year. That would pay for a single stage  reloading setup right there.

If you shoot 150 rounds twice a month (about what I shoot) that's a savings of $792 a year. That's a new pistol right there.

Of course you are trading time for money. You do that every day. Do you grow your own food or buy it at the store? Do you change your own oil or go to Jiffy Lube?

Reloading is just another time vs. money trade-off.

I enjoy reloading. I get to play with the variables and find a load that works in my gun. And works better than the $18 stuff.

I shoot them at fairly low velocities (1600-1700fps) so that I knock down the steel targets but don't get too flinchy shooting well over 100 shots off-hand in a day.

This month, etc.

I used SR4759 powder at charges of 18.0gr and 19.0gr for this test. At 18.0gr

I normally only shoot at 200 yards or more

I shot 70 10-shot strings through onto separate paper bullseyes and through a chronograph to measure the averages and velocity variances across three different loads.

Total cost at current prices is about $346

That is pretty expensive for me, primers, and bullets, and there's bound to be little things here and there like extra ammo boxes and other miscellaneous stuff that will also have to be acquired.  However, it looks like I should be able to reload for around half the price per round of commercial ammo, and once I figure out WTF I'm doing, my handloads should be hopefully much more accurate as well.  So it'll take me around 800 or more rounds to break even, it'll be another probably $50 for the dies and another turret

Does anyone have feedback about any of these components


----
----


Now, and some of these may be just me over-thinking things, so any information you can give would be appreciated:

**1. Are all primer brands of a given size interchangeable in terms of size and function?  (Of course accuracy may still be affected.)**

The book says no; some primers may be quite a bit different, do I absolutely have to get the Remington 9 1/2 primers they recommend for .243 if I want to use their load data?

**2. How many times can .243 be reloaded?  How many times for 9mm?**

The book says pressure has a major effect on how many times a case can be reloaded, 40k and 60k psi in terms of brass life; that at 40k you might get a dozen or more reloads, whereas at 60k you might get as few as 3 or 4.  I'm hoping to get as many reloads as possible since brass is the most expensive component of the cartridge.  How many reloads can I generally expect from good quality brass, and at what pressures?

As for 9mm, or 115 gr at 1087 fps; I'm leaning toward the 147s.)

**3. What is the heaviest bullet that a 1:9.125 twist rate will stabilize reliably?**

From reading online, 105, 100, 95, 90, 87, 85, but I just don't want to get a giant box of something only to find out that it's not stabilizing.

**4. When do you get rid of your brass

Visible splitting or cracking of course

**5. Do people normally just keep several pounds of powder and primers around of different types and brands?**

For instance, or do you mainly stick with one and use it for everything?

**6. How much can the cartridge OAL vary?**

The book says +/-0.005""

**7. Do you throw out damaged cases individually

The book says to throw out the entire lot when 5% (1 out of 20) cases shows any sign of needing to be retired.  Is this the same for rifle and pistol brass?

**8. The Lee 3-die .243 set has a full length sizing die, but do I need that?**

The book suggests that crimping is probably not necessary for a bolt action target rifle, or generally for ammo that may be exposed to recoil or rough handling.

**9. How do you assign lot numbers or divide up/organize your cases?**

I'm thinking if I get a bag of 100 cases

**10. What powders should I get to start off with?  I'll be reloading .243 and eventually 9mm as well.**

For .243, or does it matter?  Also, are some of these easier to measure than others?

For 9mm, Bullseye, and Titegroup.

**11. What is another good reloading manual to get?  Lee?  Hornady?  Speer?  Sierra?  Or at this point is it sufficient to just hit the websites of the bullet makers for reload data?**

Thanks in advance for your help

I've recently taken an interest in reloading

What I hope to accomplish by reloading:

*Learn a new valuable skill

*Save money

*Have a hobby that will remain relevant for much of my life

*Be able to produce high quality ammo for competition shooting (although I don't shoot competition yet due to time constraints

While on one hand I like to be well read on something before trying it

Here is my current setup: http://i.imgur.com/smgmh.jpg

I purchased the Lee Breech Lock Challenger for two reasons. The first, particularly .375 H&amp;H, and most of what I've read suggests that most people use single stage presses for higher end rifle rounds or specialty calibers. This allows the press to remain relevant for me, even if I decide to upgrade to a turret or progressive later on. 

Currently I shoot .45 ACP the most. So this is what I plan on learning to reload with. It will allow me to test my loads and receive more feedback (I hope?). So I also bought the Lee carbide dies for .45 ACP. 

I picked up the Lee Auto Prime as well. More for the Zen approach of hand loading primers than anything else. I purchased it from a local supplier and he also suggested the added benefit of being able to prime away from the bench. This appealed to me

I picked up the Hornady digital scale for powder weighing. Most people seem to dislike the balance scales and both options seemed pretty equivalent in cost for what seems like miles of difference to me

Universal Loading Block

I also picked up a set of digital calipers which aren't pictured. No one had any micrometers

I don't have a lot of space

For my first 100 rounds I purchased all new components

I purchased new Winchester Brass 100 cases, and 100 Hornady .45 cal .451 230gr FMJ-RN bullets.

Question: How can I find out exactly which tolerance of bullet that my handgun can hold? I notice that Hornady sells the .45 cal in .451, I'm not quite sure how much difference it would make pressure wise or any of the real ramifications other than too much pressure = boom. I currently shoot an XDm .45 with the 4.5"" barrel. 

Eventually once I gain experience with reloading

Question: How big of an issue is lead poisoning? Handling the bare lead bullets repeatedly for long amounts of time, and since I have children I worry about harmful effects. Is washing your hands thoroughly enough? Do any of you wear latex gloves or something similar while reloading? 

Realizing that I had nothing to experiment with at this point, it seemed fair to me, and was certainly a lot cheaper than buying it new. *EDIT* For more clarification they charge $3 a pound for mixed brass *

http://i.imgur.com/WiS9x.jpg

The largest piles are Federal and Winchester, R . P, and PMR.

Questions: Are there cheaper places to get used brass? Is this a fair shake for what I got? Also

At this point I started piddling around measuring my new brass, measurements of new factory rounds and so forth. 

I confirmed that most of the fired cases had shrunk in length (which I had expected based on what I read). The average was around .889 for fired Winchester and Federal

At this point I ran several Winchester cases through the depriming and resizing. The Lee press has a tube for collecting spent primers, and never once went into the tube. I consulted the instructions and found nothing, am I missing something?

Anyway

However the next step is where I ran into some problems. Expanding and bullet seating. I watch some online videos and most suggested working with empty cases to get your bullet seating right and then move forward. Sounded safe and reasonable

http://i.imgur.com/LX34Z.jpg

So I guess I didn't flare the first case enough and when attempting to seat the bullet I crushed the case. Oops. Also note the bullet took some wear from being used as a shaping tool, I'm looking for DANGEROUS pressure variance *

No worries

After some tinkering here and there I ended up with a success! I hope?

http://i.imgur.com/IYm1J.jpg

As you can tell the round came out with an OAL of 1.248

Question: How do you know if you've seated the bullet properly? Other than looks, how do you figure out what OAL is right, other than through experimentation. Modern Reloading only suggests a minimum and maximum OAL. Do other manuals suggest an average, or starting point, like they do with starting loads?

I decided to compare it to a factory round. I didn't have a Winchester factory at the moment, which I figured was comparable. 

http://i.imgur.com/yt7Ye.jpg

1.241 OAL

I know this was all a bit long-winded

This first one will be on stages and operation of a progressive press featuring the Hornady Lock and Load. I will go into die operation, and turret presses.

I'm currently developing a course, I hope others will volunteer because I'm not an expert yet.

I've fired just a primer before

Weapon: Ruger P89
Barrel Length: 4.5 inches
Chamber: 9mm
Bullet: 124 gr. Jacketed FP
Primer: Winchester Small Pistol (WSP)

Loaded the round

I fired the trigger

I manually racked the slide to eject the brass. The shell ejected with no bullet; so the bullet departed the brass

I ended up finding the bullet About 7/10 of an inch down the barrel. It was firmly lodged

Removing the bullet from the barrel was not trivial by any means....it did not fall out

Conclusion: A Squib round is easily detectable if paying attention...however

Ok

Here are some **Pictures** * of this weekend's reloading adventure:
http://imgur.com/a/ANThy

Here's a recap of what I was using:

**Workbench**: 2x4 Basics Workbench and Shelving Storage System ($67 + Wood) [You'll want a sturdy workbench for the press] Wow - this bench is very study and very heavy (I used 3/4"" plywood). I love it!

**Press**: Breech Lock Challenger Press and Bushings 50th Anniversary Kit 
 ($118 + 3 bolts) [Includes: Press, Scale, Powder Funnel, Cutter and lock stud, chamfer tool, sizing lube, primer pocket cleaner

**Dies/Shell Holder**: Lee 4 Carbide Pistol Die Set .45 ACP ($59) [Get dies for the caliber you intend to reload. Lee dies come with a shell holder. If non-Lee dies

**Scale**: Hornady Electronic Scale 1500 grains ($29) [You can use the scale in the Lee 50th kit

**Powder Trickler**: Redding #5 Powder Trickler ($20) [Helpful to get exactly how much powder you want]

**Caliper**: *Updated:* Carrera Precision CP9806-TF Digital Caliper ($25) [Measure cases and overall length]

**Puller**: RCBS Power Pull Bullet Puller ($19) [Correct some mistakes with this]

**Cleaning**: Frankford Arsenal Master Tumbler Kit ($67) [Brass cleaning]

**Manuals**: Lyman #49

**Brass**: New or used Brass. I used new Starline .45 Brass this time. [Best if you have saved your own used brass.]

**Bullets**: Cast you own lead bullets [I can't help there] or buy them online. I'm trying both Hornady and Rainier bullets. Used the Hornady this time. (~$150/1000 for Rainier

**Powder**: Check the Reloading Manual you get for a powder listed for your caliber. I got TiteGroup to try out on my .45 reloads. (~$20 for ~1400 rounds worth) [Start with a minimal powder load

**Primers**: Get the right sized primers for your brass. I went with Federal and CCI large pistol primers. (~$40 for 1000). Federal is what I used during this reload.


Please let me know your suggestions!

Some important things to consider when looking at my chart are:

1) I assumed $500 investment on reloading equipment

2) All brass will be purchased new and fired 5 times

3) Using reloads straight from the Lyman manual

4) Sales tax and shipping costs not included

5) Retail cost comparison was based on bullet type (FMJ, etc) and weight only; ballistic performance was not used to keep things simple

[The results](http://imgur.com/0DFoy)


tl;dr: You can justify buying reloading equipment by reloading as few as 450 .45 ACP rounds...


**EDIT:** [Here](http://i.imgur.com/8lPsq.jpg) is another cost comparison. Note that the .223 brass was only used 3 times because the assumption I made was that it was being fired through an AR. The .243 and .308 brass were used 6 times (bolt gun),False,,t5_2rloq,True,,,t3_iammz

I shot some hornady tap hp 230gr factory rounds (+p) and also saw around 1200 fps. So I got some 230 gr fmj round nose factory, and that came out about 700ish (which seems about right according to the manual).

For 50 rounds of my reloads, the minimum was 1257 and the max was 1261fps with the average of 1260.

I'm using a Lee Turret press with Lee pacesetter dies, and SMK 168gr HPBT bullets.  Overall it went pretty well.  I cleaned, deburred

There are a few issues I ran into I was hoping yall could help me with.

1) With almost 10% of my cases, but they just wouldn't come out.  Because they were now protruding from the bottom of the case, this made it impossible to remove the shell from the shellholder, so I would need to take it out, flip it over, and bash the primer back into the casing in order to get it off the shell holder.  I should note that in these cases, I also tried pushing the primer the rest of the way out manually, but to no avail.  They simply would not come out

2) While priming, and even upon fully compressing the lever, the primers would protrude a tiny bit from the case (i should note that i probably didn't do they best job cleaning the primer pockets).  [Here is a picture](http://i.imgur.com/L7N7NBO.jpg).  Are these safe to shoot? How can I prevent this from happening?

3) When I got to some of the biggest powder charges

4) Load development.  So For this bunch, and then on my second batch, I'll stick with the best charge, and vary the seating depth.  Does this sound like a good plan?  What range and what increment should I use when playing with the seating depth?

As suggested by ToxDoc I performed the ""plunk test"" with two barrels

I think that my first mistake was with the Lee Loadmaster manual which stated that the press had been preset at the factory for .45 ACP and that no out of the box adjustments were necessary. Since my first run of 30 bullets fired fine I was lulled into a false sense of security on the die settings. Hindsight being 20-20 I should have made sure that the dies were screwed down tightly. So I'm chalking it down to the dies not being firmly seated and creeping. Please correct me or point me to another possibility if you disagree

I reset all of the dies and as suggested I made a few unprimed no powder rounds until I had and OAL (1.232) and a crimp that plunked nicely into the both barrels. I also ordered a sizing gauge as suggested.

This is also the stage where I also discovered ""Glock Bulge"" as mentioned by  redditor dammitmitchell. Some brass casings had the bottom bulge issue as described and no amount of resizing could address that lower case bulge issue. I've set those off to the side and ordered a Lee Bulge Buster since I own two Glocks.

As for load data

Final thought:  What's your ""go to"" source for load data? I have Lyman's and Lee and the Alliant web source but it would be nice to have several!

There is a lot more to OAL than OAL. I reload for 9mm

When I first started reloading my only 9mm gun was an CZ SP-01 Tactical, 3 of 10 reloads or so would ever so slightly prevent the slide from closing all the way and would require a little force to manually eject. This stumped me for a solid week or two since the OAL was within what I had deemed ""spec"".

Finally I took the barrel out of the Rami inserted a reload

**tl;dr;** Just because your OAL is within spec doesn't mean it's going to work. Different bullets have a different amount of taper. Less taper can effectively reduce the maximum OAL depending on your gun's chamber. Always check your reloads to make sure they drop in and out of the chamber freely.",,t5_2rloq,1354424958.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/144zys/always_use_your_barrel_as_a_maximum_oal_gauge/

I live in an apartment where I cannot do much for modifying the walls per the lease. It does however have a very nice (to me!) 1.25 or 1.5 stall garage.
I reload ammunition for shooting and I also needed a bench to tinker with things.
I built the bench with heavy duty hinges on the back and 4X4 legs that swing in and out as the table is lifted up and down. The table is held in the up position by a short length of 550 cord.
I built it this way for a variety of reasons. The 2X6 that is screwed to the wall can be taken down quickly and the entire package folds up for moving rather easily. The second reason I built it this way was because I could have it in the up position and fit my car and other stuff into the garage more easily
Frame was built out of 2X4's and the top of the bench was supposed to be all 2X6's. Well, I'm not to concerned.

I have been preparing to reload for several months now, watching videos, more reading, etc... 

I have read through the FAQ and also purchased and am still reading The ABCs Of Reloading: The Definitive Guide for Novice to Expert. 

Despite my reading

I know the manuals have max length for cases but out of all of the videos that I have watched and friends that I have asked, and improper length on the cartridge brass could potentially lead to head space problems because the cartridge would 1) either be too long and cause a jam or 2) be too short and potentially lead to a dangerous crack near the head of the case. (Please correct me if my understanding is wrong)

In any case, money isn't an problem, all the bells and whistles, and 2) the one that you would realistically buy, which would they be?

For me right now I have an RCBS Rock Chucker Master Supreme Single Stage Press Kit as suggested by the FAQ. I intend to learn with this press and then upgrade to the Horady LNL ammo plant in the future. What case trimmer would you suggest for me as a beginner?

I have over a 1, Bullseye, Universal, Power Pistol, and Lil-gun powders at my disposal.

I have read that with the heavier bullets lil-gun is a good choice but I have also been warned that lil-gun can destroy barrels. In most cases they were referring to revolvers.  They said it caused flame cutting on the receiver and barrel erosion.  Would I have to worry about barrel erosion out of a rifle???

I have 5 magazines. And I ran each magazine through twice with 10 rounds each to test my loads.  I haven't numbered my magazines but I definitely will to see if it's a magazine issue.  Two of the magazines are new.  So

All 100 rounds went downrange without a single ammunition or weapon failure. No misfeeds, being new and all).

The batch was split in half

The SWC were loaded in batches of 10 progressing from 4.5 gr - 4.9 gr of Hodgdon's Titegroup.

The FMJ-RN were loaded in batches of 10 progressing from 4.2-4.4 and then 20 rds of 4.5.

On the FMJ I decided to stay a little lower on the charge as one person had pointed out that the Hornady digital scales have some variance problems when weighing. I erred on the side of caution for my first testing group.

Observations:

Holy shit are the unjacketed rounds dirty. There were giant clouds of powder flying from the barrel

Primers also seemed flatter on the SWC. I attribute this to having to seat the round lower in order for the round to headspace properly and creating more pressure. I would pick up brass and check the primers after every batch, especially when compared to a piece of brass I had taken to the range for comparison. 

I also noticed that my primers have a nock in the dent from the firing pin

http://i.imgur.com/hNXNH.jpg

What causes this? Is this abnormal?

Recoil was much easier to manage on all loads. I look forward to this if all my rounds keep this attribute

The residue left inside the pistol made it incredibly dirty. I have some Winchester 231 which I plan on trying in my next batch to see if this will help. I've read that it burns much cleaner.

I also picked up some brass at the range and upon examination it has kind of a shearing effect on the edge of the head. This was not fired from my weapon

I'm using Hodgdons Titegroup powder, which admittedly I should have done with a test bullet before adding powder and so forth.


It was kind of a tight fit and the bullet didn't appear to seat completely. I went back to Remington 230 RN and it went in easily and is just slightly below flush. Pictured here:  http://i.imgur.com/TErEr.jpg


So I tried slowly compressing the bullet in hoping that it would seat properly. The minimum OAL given in Lee's Modern Reloading was 1.225. I stopped at 1.228 and the results are here:  http://i.imgur.com/m7TQv.jpg

As you can see it still is slightly above flush. This was achieved without any pushing


I had originally gone with seating the bullet groups at 1.250

It sits much higher than the other two. My assumptions at this point are with the fact that the bullets are .452 and it's stopping at the throat before reaching the bore. I'm not sure if this is normal

Need a little insight - went out to shoot my first 223 reloads this afternoon. Everything went great and the ammo is definitely more accurate than the Wolf I'm accustomed to. However

Hopefully [these photos](http://imgur.com/a/wJBw8) demonstrate what is a clear bulge just above the case head, a random fired case from the desert - also a few shots of the individual bulged rounds.

I'm confused as I started towards the bottom of the Hornady manual - 21.6 gr H335 w/ 55gr vmax - so I don't think its an over-pressure issue. My first thought was maybe this was a characteristic of my use of LC rounds but it also happened on 223 stamped (PMC

I've only had a few problems

I've kept very detailed records of each batch, primer, powder, overall length, weight, time to perform task, etc.  I've also kept a log of all mistakes: split cases, etc.  Lastly I've kept a log of problems at the range

My most common problem was crap getting in my primer seating system, just to be sure.  Later I fired a few and they worked fine.  I'm still very leery of them though.

The only persistent problem I've had has been that sometimes my bullets don't seat consistently.  I'd say 1 in 15 bullets doesn't seat far enough (.05 shallow)

The scariest problem I had came from a single round, the action wasn't closed.  Again, I mistook it for an improperly sized round and tried to slam the receiver shut.  It wouldn't.   I emptied the gun, opened the action and looked down the barrel.  No light...

As you've probably figured out, Wikipedia has a [completely different definition though](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squib_%28explosive%29).

I think it happened due to the way I loaded those rounds.  I tried to load all the cases in the batch by leaving them in the tray and loading them in rows.  When I checked the rounds to make sure they got a charge, then put a bullet on it.

I'm nearly out of powder, but isn't reaching the velocity I need.

I have decided that I am going to start reloading. By that I mean I am about to start. I have been lurking around here for a little while and have been watching YouTube videos and reading as many reloading articles as I can. I understand everyone says to start with a single stage press so you can become well aware and understand every step and how it relates to the reloading process as a whole.

* Is there one Single Stage Press that is hands sown better than all other? By asking this I wish for the answer to be honest and backed with fact.  
  
* Is there one go to set for you guys? Is this personal preference? How many do you guys reference? Are the projectiles referenced in the Hornady reloading data all Hornady products and Sierra data all Sierra projectiles?  
  

* Primer, Magnum Pistol, Small Rifle and Large Rifle primers pretty comparable? CCI,Winchester &amp; Remington  
  
  
**Additional Information**    
  
  
* I am thinking about purchasing a Lee 50th Anniversary press kit, Scale and Priming System.  
  
* As I said I already own the Hornady Reloading Data and am thinking about getting the Lee Modern Reloading Vol 2 as well. Then my Local Cableas has quite a few projectile manufactures reloading data books readily available.  
  
* As of right now I have no plans on experimenting with different components and am going to follow the published data pretty much to the T.  
  
* I will eventually move to a Hornady LNL Auto Indexing Progressive Press. But I want to start with the Single Stage.

1367967117.0,1dw6ek,Shotgun Reloading 101 - Slugs and Buckshot,versalius,10,2,2,"I would like to preface this by saying I am not an expert by any means but some general info compiled into a single post might be good since I have seen multiple posts about shotgun reloading in the past month or two. General disclaimer that comes along with reloading: Reloading is obviously hazardous as we are dealing with flammable components


Retail slugs and buckshot run anywhere from 0.60 to 2.00 per round these prices fluctuated based on many factors such as payload/brand/home defense vs target vs hunting


So what do you need to start feeding your hungry deprived shotgun? I suggest casting your own slugs and buckshot if you have the time as that is where you really see the savings. Hornady 00 Buckshot runs about 25 dollars for 5lbs online or locally for me (when in stock). I source my lead that has been cleaned and molded into ingots from the Cast Boolits forum. There are other options for lead but I prefer this route as this lead is clean and ready to go into the pot and then made into whatever is on the menu for the day. Average price of lead from forums that I have seen range from 1.00 to 1.80 per pound shipped.


**Casting** – If you plan to cast more than slugs and buckshot pick up a casting manual!

For casting you need the following: casting pot, mallet and of course some lead!

* Casting pots -  These come in many different styles and sizes. Some pots can hold four pounds whereas others can hold up to twenty! For slugs and buckshot I suggest going with a large volume pot as it requires quite a bit of metal for each casting.

* Molds – Once again, many of the most popular Lee molds are going for a pretty penny on ebay and other sites.

* Protection – You're dealing with molten lead that is known to be toxic and cause health complications if handled improperly. Be smart and use protection! Gloves, closed toe shoes, safety shield mask, even can wear an apron if you wanna go crazy.


**Reloading**

For reloading you will need a press and components! 

* Single stage presses are affordable and offer a good platform to learn the steps of reloading and the importance of quality control before you upgrade to a progressive. Check out various online retailers for different types of presses available at the various price ranges.

* Components – You will need other components besides your cast slugs or buckshot! Hulls, use it, love it. Using published data is better than missing some fingers. Also due to current crazy market, many components may be difficult to obtain or still remain at retard prices.

With the above you should be able to assemble your own shells for that hungry shotgun that you have neglected due to current ammo prices!

1360002929.0,17vnrd,1st time reloading - lots of duds 44mag,devousivac,8,2,22,"OK - so I loaded up some 44mag rounds for my first journey into reloading. It was very satisfying and everything was safe but I seem to be having some sort of issue with primers. About one round in six wouldn't go off on the first hammer strike through my S&amp;W 29-2 44mag. If I cycled through the cylinder a second time the round that was a dud the first time usually would go off. As the gun has never done this with factory ammo ever before I'm thinking one of the following happened:

1) I got bad primers
2) The hammer strike is just not strong enough for some unusually tough primers
3) I did something wrong

As it was my first time reloading I think the highest probability is number 3 and have heard that primers that aren't full seated can do this.

Im confused with the double disk kit. The Pro-Auto disk powder measure came with disks. Do I need to use the double disk kit that I also have? I have 8 disks now. 

Im reloading .223 with H335.

I know its to ""double the capacity"" so if I want 24.3 grains of powder it says I need to use the 1.57 hole on the disk. So to use the double disk kit do I use both disks with the 1.57 hole and stack them? 

or do I use two disks to get to the total of 1.57 which would be the .95 hole on one disk and the .61 hole on the other disk and stack those two? 

Im just slightly confused. If I stack the two 1.57 holes wouldnt that throw 3.14cc of powder or is there something going on that I dont know. 

Thanks for any help!",,t5_2rloq,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/177875/question_for_you_guys_with_lee_double_disk_kit/
1358740239.0,16yvzi,For those with a Lee Safety Scale thinking about upgrading....here is a comparison to the RCBS 5-0-5.,jdc0589,11,4,8,"I've been loading 9mm for a few months now

In preparation for loading precision .223


**Comparison**

* **Course Adjustment**: The ball bearing the Lee uses for course adjustments is pretty comparable to the RCBS. They differ a little

* **Fine Adjustment**: The Lee uses a piece of plastic with windows cut in it that line up with hash marks on the beam in certain positions for its fine measurements. It is extremely annoying to adjust and it takes a lot of playing with to get it to go where you want. On top of that, forget about using it. On the other hand, the RCBS uses two metal pieces that simply fit in to notches on the beam. There is no guesswork about what the exact measurement is, and setting the scale for a certain weight is straightforward and easy. Also, if you look at the Lee fine adjustment piece the wrong way it will move, potentially throwing off your measurements. The RCBS does not have this problem, as the adjustment pieces fit in to physical notches in the beam.

* **Powder Pan**: The lee has a single powder pan that hooks directly on to the beam. Taking the pan on and off can throw off zero (usual doesn't), which will make it a lot easier to use with a trickler.

* **Zeroing**: Zeroing the Lee scale involves putting all the weight adjustments in the zero position (which is annoying in the case of the fine adjustment piece) and turning a threaded weight in the middle of the beam in the necessary direction until things are zeroed. One side of the bolt this weight is mounted on has a spring on it

* **Beam Balancing**: The beam on the Lee scale takes **forever** to balance out after you nudge an adjustment, I decided the Lee was getting given away along with lots of warnings, simply because I can't bring myself to charge anyone for it.

___

**tl;dr**: FUCK YOU LEE. I cant believe they are selling this piece of shit to people at **any** price. They should be paying customers to get rid of their inventory and then stop making them. If you have a Lee safety scale go ahead and melt, or otherwise destroy that piece of shit immediately. The RCBS is fantastic, but the real moral of this story is that while some Lee products are awesome, **stay the hell away from their scale**.",,False,,1358740857.0,t3_16yvzi

My local gun store is having trouble keeping stocked up on primers, I ran out of Federal primers midway through and so replaced them with the new TulAmmo primers.  The second I actually started loading cartridges with the new primers, I began experiencing issues.

These primers just plain don't want to go into the case right.  Some were smashed while many were put in sideways.  Even on the ones that went in correctly

Does anybody have any experience with this?  I don't know what to do about it, either.  And before anyone asks, they are definitely small pistol primers, not large pistol primers.
