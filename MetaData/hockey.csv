&gt; Meeting over. Bettman says NHL made new offer to NHLPA.

**Pierre LeBrun [tweet #2](https://twitter.com/Real_ESPNLeBrun/status/258245695784497152)**
&gt; Bettman says offer contingent on having 82-game season which would begin Nov 2. Says league offered 50/50 share of HRR

**Pierre LeBrun [tweet #3](https://twitter.com/Real_ESPNLeBrun/status/258246478462599168)**
&gt; League offer of 50/50 split would begin in Year 1. No phasing in

**Update** -- Seeing reports that this deal would NOT have a salary rollback (which the players are against)

**Update 2

**Katie Strang [tweet #1](https://twitter.com/KatieStrangESPN/status/258248737258872835)**
&gt; CBA From what I'm hearing

**Katie Strang [tweet #2](https://twitter.com/KatieStrangESPN/status/258248910903062528)**
&gt; CBA (cont'd) ...so assume escrow is capped and there is some sort of mechanism in place to protect contracts already on the books

**Update 3

**Pierre LeBrun [tweet #4](https://twitter.com/Real_ESPNLeBrun/status/258250975238844416)**
&gt; Am told in NHL offer there is a proposal designed to ""protect"" players for salary reductions in the initial years

**Update 4

**Pierre LeBrun [tweet #5](https://twitter.com/Real_ESPNLeBrun/status/258251638417027072)**

&gt; Also league has taken off table some of the systemic changes to player contracts which they asked for in initial July offer

**Update 5 -- Darren Dreger finally weighs in on how the salary protection will work**

**Darren Dreger [tweet #1](https://twitter.com/DarrenDreger/status/258253351723073536)**
&gt; NHL intends on calculating lost salary in getting to 50-50 and will pay the players back over time.

**Darren Dreger [tweet #2](https://twitter.com/DarrenDreger/status/258253503691112448)**
&gt; The payback to the players would occur over the balance of their contracts.

**Update 6 -- Michael Grange here with Fehr quotes to give us a reality check**

**Michael Grange [tweet #1](https://twitter.com/michaelgrange/status/258253423038853120)**
&gt; Fehr -- the process now is to read proposal completely and make sure we understand it and discuss with out executive board

**Michael Grange [tweet #2](https://twitter.com/michaelgrange/status/258253621240659968)**
&gt; Fehr -- the hope is this is something we can negotiate of off ... But we cant say that yet

**Michael Grange [tweet #3](https://twitter.com/michaelgrange/status/258253813570482176)**
&gt; Fehr -- does seem to be an improvement in some respect but can't say for sure yet

&gt; Fehr -- deal is for at least six years but I don't know precisely

**Update 7 - The Fourth Period with an update on HRR**

**The Fourth Period [tweet #1](https://twitter.com/TheFourthPeriod/status/258251726262501377)**
&gt; Just told from NHL source that the NHL's new offer is based on current HRR definition

**Update #8 (I really have to get back to work) -- Aaron Ward &amp; Pierre LeBrun with updates on the NHLPA's plan**

**Aaron Ward [tweet #1](https://twitter.com/aaronward_nhl/status/258253068385284097)**
&gt; NHLPA has called a 5 PM (Eastern) conference call for the Executive Board and the Negotiating Committee.

**Pierre LeBrun [tweet #5](https://twitter.com/Real_ESPNLeBrun/status/258254389423259649)**
&gt; Fehr cautious. NHLPA will respond sooner rather than later.

**Final Update for now -- Josh Rimer (on air guy for NHL Home Ice) with an anonymous response from a player**

**Josh Rimmer [tweet #1](https://twitter.com/JoshRimerHockey/status/258253275516792832)**
&gt; Just spoke to an NHL Player who is ecstatic about the new NHL Proposal! Told me it's a great day for hockey and a great day for the NHL.

**OK I lied

All of this is from John Shannon ([@JSportsnet](https://twitter.com/JSportsnet)):

If the players take 50-50...offers on other keys issues as follows...

* Free Agency would be at 28 and 8 years of service.

* Entry Level Contracts would be ~~4~~ 3 years in length. (previously said 4

* Revenue sharing would be at or near 200 million dollars

* Contract Lengths would be 5 years. 

* Arbitration would still exist

* The only core issue that remains intact from previous NHL offers is the length on contracts (on all new deals).

**Update #785**

[Video of Fehr's presser](http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2012/10/16/nhl-labor-talks/1636627/)

[Video of Bettman's presser](http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=35&amp;id=188239&amp;cmpid=twt)

From Bettman's presser: The reason they delivered the proposal today is that it will allow them 9-10 days to negotiate. Should they sign a deal after 10 days

**Update # I forget -- Biz Nasty weighs in!!**

**Big story:** It has taken three calendar years and four NHL seasons for the Chicago Blackhawks to work their way back to this point. The Blackhawks also led the 2010 Stanley Cup Final 3-2 after five games before polishing off the franchise’s first NHL championship in 49 years by beating the host Philadelphia Flyers in overtime of Game 6.

This time, if necessary, at United Center.

Patrick Kane

There’s just one problem

Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews also got hurt in the game and missed the entire third period sitting on the bench

""Johnny is doing much better today

**Team Scope:** 

**Blackhawks:** Chicago isn’t exactly healthy heading into Monday’s game. The Blackhawks already had Marian Hossa gritting his way through an upper-body injury that made him a surprise scratch in Game 3 and then lost Toews to an undisclosed upper-body injury on Saturday night. Toews took several hard hits, and joined them after the game for the team’s traditional postgame on-ice salute to their fans. Prior to departing, Toews assisted on both of Kane’s goals and would leave a huge gap to fill if he can’t play. Look for rookie Andrew Shaw, who double shifted in the third, to replace Toews on the top line if needed.

“I think you look at the situation we're in, but if he's not [playing], we have to find a way to get it done either way.”

**Bruins:** The good news is that Bergeron is being listed as day-to-day with a “body injury, which could potentially require a lengthy recovery. Without Bergeron for almost all of the second and third periods in Game 5, Boston lost the overall faceoff battle for the first time in this series and just the fifth time in 21 postseason games. That aided Chicago’s effort to make its one-goal lead in the third hold up until Dave Bolland scored into an empty net late. Another issue is towering star defenseman Zdeno Chara having a combined minus-5 rating in the past two games and being on the ice for all eight of Chicago’s goals in those contests.

“We’ve got a group of guys with a lot of character, and we just want to try to use that [Monday].”

**Who's hot:** Just like the Western Conference Final against the Los Angeles Kings

1366985538.0,1d5k63,Survey Results!!,TeroTheTerror,1105,181,490,"Alright so here's all the results from [this survey by WoundedLeprechaun](http://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/1bv098/team_fandom_survey/)

**Basics**

* The survey lasted 5 days and there were 1145 responses.
* The average respondent loves 1.61 teams, dislikes 5.50 teams and hates 3.74 teams
* The average team had 61.37 loves, 209.80 dislikes and 142.77 hates.
* No one hated every team but their own (but a few people were pretty close)

**The Score**

I gave a Love response 2pts, Dislike -1pt and Hate -2pts, then for each team this was added together and averaged into a final score.  In addition each person who took the survey had their score calculated (add together all their responses/30).

* Average respondent score was -0.13
* Lowest respondent score was -1.73
* Highest respondent score was 0.87
* 791 people had negative scores
* 299 people had positive scores
* 55 people had a score of zero
* 7 teams scored positively: Jets, Oil, Jackets, Avs and Hawks
   * The highest of which was CBJ with 0.41 (best team liked
* 22 teams scored negatively
   * The lowest of which was Boston with -0.59 (worst overall opinion
* 1 team scored zero: Ducks
* From all the scores a [fan positivity chart](http://i.imgur.com/38EdsLa.png) was made...good news!  We're all a bunch of negative bastards!  No team's fans had an overall positive score
   * All opinions but those of the fan's own team were included
   * The least negative fans were the Bolts and the Jets both with -0.07
   * The most negative fans were the Kings with -0.34

**Rivalries**

Continuing with the score

* [Here's the chart](http://i.imgur.com/2w19Gd8.png)
   * Negative scores are red
   * There were a few people who said they rooted for a team, but in the end they were (it doesn't really affect the data overall)
* [The two teams' scores were then added to one another to create a rivalry chart.](http://i.imgur.com/q99BsAz.png)
   * The idea here was if two teams really hated each other they would have a more negative combined score and bigger rivalry
   * Less than -2 is black (biggest rivalry), more than 0 light green, more than 1 dark green (friendliest teams).
   * Surprise!  The biggest rivalry was Flyers/Pens (-3.85), PHX/LAK (-3.51) and Bos/Van (-3.45).
   * Apparently everyone loves Winnipeg because they had as many scores over 1 as the rest of the league combined (4 - Calgary
* Then the [differences between what 2 teams thought of one another](http://i.imgur.com/SnHNDmm.png) was charted (absolute value of their scores subtracted)
   * Everyone has 0 in their own column because it was their score - their score = 0
   * If there was a difference of great than 1 is was colored red
   * Boston and Vancouver both had 4 discrepancies of over 1

**The Charts**

*Quick note: I gave 2 example charts and asked what people liked the most in a previous post

**All horizontal stacked charts are in percentages

Overall:

* [Number of responses per team](http://i.imgur.com/ubaQFGQ.png)
* [Stacked Chart](http://i.imgur.com/e9D04HE.png) showing overall response
   * [Sorted by Love](http://i.imgur.com/jobbAB2.png) - Pittsburgh is the most loved team
   * [Sorted by Love+Like](http://i.imgur.com/XOP5Uvd.png)
   * [Sorted by Indifference](http://i.imgur.com/aVbCpGV.png)
   * [Sorted by Dislike+hate](http://i.imgur.com/ZSr6uMP.png)
   * [Sorted by Hate](http://i.imgur.com/USCpcWH.png) - Pittsburgh is also the most hated team
   * [Sorted by Score](http://i.imgur.com/zY2QMpg.png) (highest score is highest up on the chart
* [Vertical Bar Chart](http://i.imgur.com/FNUT8Ta.png) (overall raw numbers)
* [Grouped by division and conference](http://i.imgur.com/gMfmVgX.png)
* [The East's Opinion](http://i.imgur.com/l79S07E.png) (sorted alphabetically)

* [Just the raw numbers](http://i.imgur.com/FNDvzAx.png) and by [Percentage](http://i.imgur.com/3nDKPvC.png)

Fan Charts:

**There are a fuck-ton of charts per team, one's a vertical bar (raw numbers) and the other is a horizontal stacked (percentages), and finally there's 2 for the league (same idea as with the conferences).**

##**Team Scope:**




**SHARKS:** Game 7 in any playoff series is a pressure-cooker
 

Sharks center Scott Gomez
 

""It means I'm getting old
 
Gomez is 6-3 in his nine Game 7s
 

""I'll never forget the worst moment, 'When it comes to Game 7, if you can look yourself in the mirror after and know you gave it your all, that's what it's about.' I'll always remember him saying that.""




**KINGS:**  The Los Angeles franchise doesn't have a lot of recent Game 7 experience -- the most recent time the club played in one was 2002 -- but that doesn't mean the players don't have history in Game 7s.
 

Mike Richards is 3-0 in Game 7s
 

Kings captain Dustin Brown said having those players, so Tuesday shouldn't be something out of the ordinary.
 

""You've also got guys that have played in an Olympic gold-medal game, Richards and Drew Doughty, who played for Canada in the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. ""Guys have experience in big games. You look at a group of our guys [who] have won world juniors ... those final games in those world juniors and world championships and Olympics, those are Game 7s. It's a matter of using that experience and trying to get yourself ready.""

with the realization that the owners plan to scuttle the winter classic next week that has all changed. now i want to burn it all down.


**FUCK THIS FUCKING LEAGUE AND ALL THE FUCKING DOUCHEBAG OWNERS AND ESPECIALLY FUCK THAT DEMENTED OOMPA LOOMPA LAWYER


I AM SO DONE WITH CARING ABOUT A LEAGUE THAT DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ANYTHING BUT THE MONEY


it's fucking transparent to me that the owners have a plan for the future of the league that includes a bunch of big revenue streams and they don't want to share that with anyone


if this lockout was about fixing the game there would be progress made toward a new cba


i'm done. i'm officially an nfl fan now (go seahawks). at this point i want to watch the nhl burn.


FUCKING CANCEL YOUR SEASON AGAIN YOU BUNCH OF RETARDS. i hope to god the players don't fold and accept that shit ass offer. i want the owners to feel pain. i want teams to go bankrupt. I WANT TO SEE A PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE GARY FUCKING BETTMAN HAS TO STAND BEHIND THE MIKE WITH A BLOODY NOSE AND A SHINER BECAUSE AN OWNER PUNCHED HIM IN HIS FUCKING FACE. i want a meltdown of chernobyl proportions such that hockey is never the same in the world. i want hockey to be lower on the north american sports totem pole than some fucking dressage horse dancing bullshit.

My name is Ryan, I'm very proud of my work, and have been posting it to r/hockey when appropriate.

Here at the Griffins, sharing and talking about content on here daily. We all love and respect the community here, and want nothing more than to support it.

A while ago

First and foremost: **we do not want to spam.** Like I said

What it comes down to is this: we are proud of the content we create, in the form of exclusive player AMAs or behind-the-scenes content** for instance. You would never see something that we were told by someone else to post, but instead **see content that the handful of us are responsible for.**

TL;DR: I work for an American Hockey League team and we want to know your thoughts about us creating an official team user account to provide the community with exclusive content.
