Think of why you want your doctor to sign these and think of a good argument for him to sign them. Mention the fact that you already use marijuana and it helps

Category 2 of these forms allow the doctor to sign for whatever he thinks it will help with. Some doctors have signed for minor arthritis and anxiety. **You have nothing to lose by asking, you have nothing to lose. 

**If you have no medical condition you can still use this program**. Print the forms and find family members who may be willing to get them signed (for whatever medical reason) for the program and have them designate you as their grower (YES THEY CAN). 

Failing that

This takes determination. **Don't bitch out and whine that your doctor won't sign, find someone else**.

According to Trutanich

Except...

There are no Mexican fire ants. There is the notorious red imported fire ant - solenopsis invicta - but that's from Brazil, what does that prove about the origin of marijuana in Los Angeles dispensaries? If a cannabis dispensary uses chopsticks to pull marijuana buds from jars does that mean that the marijuana is being supplied by Chinese spies?

Pesticide testing is not a trivial exercise. It requires big, pesticide testing requires a large plant sample to produce precise results. EMA, the largest testing lab in California requires a minimum 200 gram sample. So, did Los Angeles dispensaries sell Mr. Trutanich's undercover cops three half-pound bags of weed? That's an interesting scenario... ""I'll take a brownie, an eighth of Kush, and... throw in half a pound of that Sour D."" It's more likely that Mr. Trutanich would have had much smaller samples tested, with a much higher risk of error in the testing.

But what's this insecticide poisoning cannabis patients in LA? Well, herbs and vegetables throughout the world, including cannabis. See, most pyrethroids aren't all that toxic, except to fish and some insects. However, they're not that good at stopping fire ants. Nothing is.

What's with this whole Mexican angle? Mr Trutanich claims that bifenthrim is not used in California and by implication that its use is restricted to less enlightened places,000 pounds of bifenthrim on their crops in 2007. They used it on corn, almonds, strawberries, even wine grapes. Fifty tons of it.

What messages should we take away from Trutanich's Cassandra call? That the City Attorney and the County DA will say anything in their attempt to close LA's medical cannabis collectives and that you might wish to keep medical cannabis away from your aquarium. Remember that in June 2009

Trutanich stated to FOX NEWS ""it's not enough to say conclusively that this dope is coming from here (Mexico), if it quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, you know, chances are that if you look a little closer, you may be dealing with a duck.""

Well... if it thinks like a duck

California cannabis patients should be protected from contaminants in their medicine. That protection comes from intelligent regulations,False,self,t5_2qhhn,False,,,t3_9tiaj

""It's bad for your health"" - Wrong! Marijuana is way better for you than tobacco. In fact, no chemicals added) is more harmful than natural marijuana. I'm not gonna argue that you're better off smoking than not smoking... but I would say that if you're gonna smoke anything, make it marijuana before tobacco. Nobody has EVER died from a marijuana overdose.

""It's a gateway drug"" - Terrible argument. Marijuana is not a gateway drug. If someone is gonna do cocaine or something

""If you smoke marijuana, do homework, go on my computer, etc. I pretty much do the same things that I do when I'm sober. The only difference is that I do these things feeling less anxious and open-minded.

Regardless of this, getting ready and about to get out the door to go to school when the Police where outside asking for my dad. I looked at them and told them I'd get him, he worked all night and was sleeping in his room. They said ""No, we have to come in with you."" 

As I opened the door to his room, which he wasn't.. he didn't even wake up when I opened his door. They got him out of bed and took him to the kitchen where they asked him to call someone to 'take us to school'. He picked up the phone and called his brother, he didn't answer his phone. Then the cop said ""Look, don't make us embarrass you in front of your family"" while holding a baton, seemingly ready to use it. I couldn't believe these people would say something like this to my father. I mean, he didn't kill anyone or wasn't trying to defy them. Why is it his fault that someone didn't answer their phone? 

He ended up calling my mother to come out of work. I will never forget that day, in high school I did it a few times, nothing special.
