1372286981.0,1h51wt,I want to provide Python mentors for people looking to get better. Who could use this?,cjbarber,216,21,46,"**Who are you?**

You've been working for 20 years and are learning programming to change jobs, or you're trying to start a startup at some point in the future but need to become a better programmer first.

**Why?**

From personal experience, and especially to supplement the *tons* of existing resources that are already out there.

Having access to a mentor enables you to get help quickly

I would like to help connect experienced developers who want to help out aspiring programmers

Existing methods of finding mentors are not easy or user friendly in any way. And unfortunately


-------

**To potential mentors**

Potential mentors - hopefully a few potential mentees will comment below and explain why they would love to have you so much - but let me try. Not only is mentoring extremely self-rewarding (and studies have actually shown that helping others will make you happy - I personally believe if you want to help others selflessly that's amazing, but also feedback and ideas on your own projects.

------

**What will this cost.**

**$0.00** (No catches. Mentors will be volunteers

Later on to ensure that this stays alive

-------

**How will this be structured?**

That's something that I'm currently working out. I've worked on two mentorship programs with Stanford University (one that I started, especially in how we can make this as amazing an experience as possible for the mentors, and also how we can entice and attract more mentors.

-----

**What's the status?**

I already have a few mentors and mentees that have expressed interest! I think to keep the experience as good as possible


**What now? How can you help?**

If you could use this service, hire a blimp to send me a message, etc :)

Indicate that you want Python and help me work out what people need most by filling this out.

I'll need a bunch of people to fill this out - but the fact is that large groups are always made up of lone individuals! *Your* response alone will make a difference

If you have experience running mentoring programs, please send me a message on reddit or email me with [myusername]@stanford.edu

The downside is that it would cost a little money! (Definitely less than what many in-class or online courses charge.) This project is really just in the development stage

* In a World Without Object Orientated Programming!

AYNRAND420 loves chess

    squares = []
    
    #there are 8 ranks in a chess board (top to bottom)
    for temp in range(8): 
    	
        squares.append([])
    	
        #there are 8 files in a chess board (left to right)
        for temp2 in range(8):
        
            squares[-1].append([])
			
The squares list looks like this:

    [[  [],[],[],[],[],[]  ],
     [  [],[],[],[],[],[]  ],
     [  [],[],[],[],[],[]  ],
     [  [],[],[],[],[],[]  ],
     [  [],[],[],[],[],[]  ],
     [  [],[],[],[],[],[]  ],
     [  [],[],[],[],[],[]  ],
     [  [],[],[],[],[],[]  ]]

This is a great start

    def makeBoard():
        squares = []
    
        #there are 8 ranks in a chess board (top to bottom)
        for temp in range(8): 
        
            squares.append([])
            
            #there are 8 files in a chess board (left to right)
            for temp2 in range(8):
            
                squares[-1].append([])

        return squares
    
    board1 = makeBoard()
    board2 = makeBoard()
    board3 = makeBoard()

Now

    #PIECE REFERENCING SYSTEM
    #P = pawn
    #N = knight
    #B = bishop
    #R = rook
    #Q = queen
    #K = king
    #E = empty

Crap

    #REVISED PIECE REFERENCING SYSTEM
    #BP = black pawn
    #BN = black knight
    #BB = black bishop
    #BR = black rook
    #BQ = black queen
    #BK = black king
    #EE = empty
    #WP = white pawn
    #WN = white knight
    #WB = white bishop
    #WR = white rook
    #WQ = white queen
    #WK = white king
	
The squares list looks like this:

    [  [""BR""],[""BQ""],[""BK""],[""BB""],[""BN""],[""BR""]  ],
    [  [""BP""],[""BP""],[""BP""],[""BP""],[""BP""],[""BP""]  ],
    [  [""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""]  ],
    [  [""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""]  ],
    [  [""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""]  ],
    [  [""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""],[""EE""]  ],
    [  [""WP""],[""WP""],[""WP""],[""WP""],[""WP""],[""WP""]  ],
    [  [""WR""],[""WQ""],[""WK""],[""WB""],[""WN""],[""WR""]  ]

AYNRAND420 thinks things are just beginning to heat up. In no time
the square belongs to to conclude which moves the bishop can make. He needs to implement a flipping function which will flip the board if the user draws the black side. Pawns can only
move forward. How on earth is the board going to know if it is flipped or not? Furthermore

At the first obstacle

    [ ""piece code""

And he could have appended his move list after the board. It is a valid way to do things. But it is not the best way. Firstly, they would be embarrassed for poor AYNRAND420. Secondly, had AYNRAND420 gone through with the project, he personally would have spent far more time on debugging, error handling, and defensive programming than he should have. His solutions to the large list of chess programming obstacles would need more code than an OOP project. Programming it just wouldn't be fun.

* Classes as abstract data types 

AYNRAND420 loves to organize and group things because it is in his nature as a human being. He eats in his kitchen; he sleeps in his bedroom; he watches TV in his lounge room. There is ultimately no greater evidence for the fact that people like AYNRAND420 love to group things than the fact that there are 70+ subgenres of metal music. Because he loves to group and sort, and modularity.

In the last section
separate boards. If you step back to think about this
(string, boolean, list, dict) to describe something as complex and fascinating as a chess board when python lets him create his own data types, which are a combination of 
its own inbuilt types?

    class board:
    
        def __init__(self):
            #the __init__ function automatically runs whenever you create
            #a new 'board'. So
			
            self.squares = []
            self.moves = []
            self.flipped = False
            self.whitesTurn = True
			
            #the self argument must be included in all functions defined in the
            #class
            #boards are being 'worked on' when the class is called

AYNRAND420 has now defined board as an abstract data type! The class definition above is the ""blueprint"" for any board created. Working with a board is much simpler than sifting through lists within lists within lists

    a = board()        #create a new 'instance' of board
    print a.flipped    #will print ""False""
    print a.squares[n] #will print whatever is stored in the nth square (by default
    print a.whitesTurn #will print ""True""

And AYNRAND420 can put anything in the blueprint that he wishes. Player 1's name and rank? Sure. The clock time left for each player? Why not? But, a piece and a square all have very different properties. They're described and behave in different ways. He can do things the hard way,
by trying to cram everything into the board class, he can separate them into a number of different classes that interact with each other like real systems do in the real world.

* Classes as miniature programs

AYNRAND420 can access his class' attributes from outside the class as shown in the very last code snippet. However
do the manipulation from within the class. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, so that he doesn't have to worry about them when working on different parts of his program. Secondly, it will be easier for him to isolate an error and reduce the total number of errors if he limits the external code that can mess with the internals of a class instance.

    class square:
    
        def __init__(self
            self.rank = rank
            self.file = file
            self.lDiagonal = self.setDiagonal(rank
            self.rDiagonal = self.setDiagonal(rank
            self.piece = None
        
        def setDiagonal(self, axis):
            #add code here to derive the diagonal
            #of a square from the rank and file
            return None #fix this later
        
        def setPiece(self
            self.piece = piece
        
        def emptySquare(self):
            self.piece = None
		
    a = square(3
    a.setPiece(""Pawn"") #put a pawn down on that square
    print a.piece      #prints ""Pawn""
    print a.rank       #prints 3
    a.setPiece(""Rook"") #put a rook down on that square
	
The best way to think about a class is that it is a miniature program. You have it optionally perform some task when it is started

* Classes as systems that interact with each other.

I think I need some text here to make my formatting consistent.

    class board:
    
        def __init__(self):
            self.moves = []
            self.flipped = False
            self.whitesTurn = True
            
            self.squares = []

                for temp2 in range(8): #there are 8 files on a board
                    self.squares.append(square(temp

        def standard(self):
            #function to setup the board with the ""standard""

                #set black pawns down
                if sq.rank == 1:
                    sq.setPiece(""Black""
				
                #set white pawns down
                if sq.rank == 6:

                if sq.rank == 0 or sq.rank == 7:
					
                    if sq.rank == 0: 
                        col = ""White""
                    if sq.rank == 7: 
                        col = ""Black""

                        sq.setPiece(col
                    if sq.file == 2 or sq.file == 5:

                        sq.setPiece(col

                if sq.rank == 2 or sq.rank == 3 or sq.rank == 4 or sq.rank == 5:
                    sq.setPiece(None

        def getPiece(self
            for sq in self.squares:
                if sq.rank == rank and sq.file == file:
                    return sq.piece
					
                
    class square:
    
        def __init__(self
            self.rank = rank
            self.file = file
            self.piece = None
        
        def setPiece(self
            self.piece = piece(colour
        
        def emptySquare(self):

That board is automatically decked out with the lot.
	
Additions AYNRAND420 can make:

Move Class:

* Pass it a board

Square Class:

* This is pretty much complete for now. He just has to add more interactions from the board to the piece.

Board Class:

* Add a function that will 'move' a piece from one square to another
* Add functions that allow it to 'talk' to a GUI

But this is besides the point. The main point is that each class is its own little world. It knows nothing of the world outside, and return specific data. Classes can simplify very convoluted code.

1375039065.0,1j89l9,[Tutorial] Basic Twitter Bot,bert720,57,4,13,"This was a small project I did to teach myself the Twitter API

### Project
[Github Project](https://github.com/robertjanzen/random-bitly)

### Setup
**Step 1:** Create a gmail and twitter account. Once you have a twitter account you'll need to connect that account to a [development account](https://dev.twitter.com/). Once you have a dev account click on 'create a new application'. You'll be given a consumer key and consumer secret right away but you have to manually create your OAuth credentials. Once you do you should also have an access token and access token secret. These 4 credentials are used by your script to log in to your Twitter account automatically.

**Step 2:** Create a free account on [Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/). This will be used to automatically run your script once every hour (or whatever time frame you choose). Once you're logged in you'll want to head to 'EC2 - Virtual Servers In The Cloud'. Go to 'Instances' and click 'Launch Instance'. I chose the 64 bit Ubuntu Server 12.04.2 LTS. Create a keypair and place it somewhere you'll remember. This is going to be used to connect to the server via SSH. From here you'll be given instructions on how to connect to the server with your terminal.  

**Step 3:** Copy the two scripts into the home directory of your server instance. Make sure you've entered your Twitter development credentials into twitterbot.py. To schedule this script to run every hour edit the crontab.

`crontab -e`

You only need to add one line:

    0 * * * * python /home/ubuntu/twitterbot.py

Next install the dependancies listed in the Github Project readme. That's it! You should now have an active twitter bot.

### Code

I won't go over everything but I can point out a couple things I think are interesting in my code. If you have any questions please ask.

In twitterbot.py:

    if randrange(1
        bot.update_status('{title} - {url}'.format(title=title
    else:
        bot.update_status(""{title} - You'll never know!"".format(title=title))

This is used to beat the Twitter spam filter. The goal of this bot is not to gain attention or sell something

In bitlify.py:
 
    while True:
        try:
            url = id_generator()
            urlopen(url)
            break
        except (HTTPError
            pass
    return  url

This attempts to find a valid URL. If it doesn't it returns an error and it will keep looking until id_generator creates a valid address. It usually takes 1 to 4 tries before a valid link is returned.

Hope some of this helps let me know if you have questions!",,t5_2r8ot,1375113210.0,,py27bggh,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1j89l9/tutorial_basic_twitter_bot/
1368753235.0,1ehmr5,[Tutorial] Sets in Python,jameseric,54,4,8,"This tutorial provides an overview of the `set` data type

## Preface ##


To spare me a few key strokes
everything in this document can also be applied to sets in Python 2.

## What are sets? ##

Even if you're not familiar with sets
other iterable data types (for the time being
iterable `;)`): lists
mapping
the two differ a bit due to mutability which also affects resource consumption.

In the simplest sense
same value to a set does nothing:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; myset = {1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; myset
    {1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; myset.add(5)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; myset
    {1, 5}
    &gt;&gt;&gt; myset.add(3)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; myset
    {1, 5}

Converting a list or tuple to a set will result in all duplicates being
eliminated:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; L = ['once', 'time', 'there', 'was', 'once', 'a', 'duck.']
    &gt;&gt;&gt; set(L)
    {'a', 'duck.', 'time', 'was', 'once'}

Remember what I said about pretending strings aren't iterable? Let's throw that
out the window now. Surely you lie awake at night wondering how many distinct
letters ""pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis"" contains. Prepare
yourself for a sound night's sleep:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; word = 'pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; len(word)
    45
    &gt;&gt;&gt; set(word)
    {'a', 'i', 'm', 'l', 'o', 'n', 'p', 'r'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; len(_)
    14

You'll notice the order of the items in the sets is not generally preserved.
One of the properties of sets is that
In fact
dictionaries](http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/364638d6434d/Lib/sets.py). The
unordered nature is a consequence of set members being indexed by their hash
values which makes membership tests run in O(1) rather than O(n). In short
this means rather than having to check do an equality check on every single
value in a set

Although I will be sticking to common builtins for my examples
be used to store non-primitive objects
reference as with all iterables in Python
generally negligible. If you have an object factory or otherwise have the
ability to create objects that are equal in the sense of ""=="" but not in the
sense of ""is""
which I will discuss later for optimum set-friendliness.

## Use Cases for Sets ##

### Membership Test En Masse ###

As mentioned previously
them very useful for comparing groups of things. When given two groups of
things that need to be tested for membership against each other
common for novice programmers to do something like this:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; # Checking to find items contained in two groups
    &gt;&gt;&gt; in_both_groups = list()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for item in group_one:
    ...     if item in group_two:
    ...         in_both_groups.append(item)

    &gt;&gt;&gt; # Checking for items missing in one group
    &gt;&gt;&gt; missing_items = list()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for item in group_one:
    ...     if item not in group_two:
    ...         missing_items.append(item)

It is in this type of situation that sets excel especially when dealing with
large groups of things:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; # Checking to find items contained in two groups
    &gt;&gt;&gt; in_both_groups = group_one.intersection(group_two)

    &gt;&gt;&gt; # Checking for items missing in one group
    &gt;&gt;&gt; missing_items = group_two - group_one

When possible
even if they were not created as sets
the iterables as sets and use the set operations than to for use the for loop
method. Let's do some runtime speed comparisons.

First
elements:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; for_loop_code = """"""
    ... missing_items = list()
    ... for item in a:
    ...     if item not in b:
    ...         missing_items.append(item)
    ... """"""
    &gt;&gt;&gt; from timeit import Timer
    &gt;&gt;&gt; timer = Timer(
    ...     for_loop_code
    &gt;&gt;&gt; timer.timeit(10)
    9.217123031616211

This code runs through the for loops 10 times then prints the duration in
seconds. Each for loop takes a little less than one second to run. Now
try this with sets:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; timer = Timer(
    ...     'missing_items = b - a'
    ...     'a = set(range(10**4)); b = set(range(10**4))')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; timer.timeit(10)
    0.0039539337158203125

That's more than 2
use 1, but stopped after I realized the for loop
method would take way too long. With sets,000 elements are still in less
than a second on my desktop:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; timer = Timer(
    ...     'missing_items = b - a'
    ...     'a = set(range(10**7)); b = set(range(10**7))')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; timer.timeit(10)
    0.3704690933227539

The remaining use case examples are going to be relatively short compared to
this one given what I covered and generally going to just present hypothetical
situations where you can benefit from the use of sets.

### Filtering ###

Sets are great for filtering things
something
provide a significant performance boost. In a hypothetical situation for
malware scanning
this:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; # Create a set containing all of the malware hashes
    &gt;&gt;&gt; with open('malware.hashes') as iostream:
    ...     malware_hashes = set(map(str.strip
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for filename
    ...     if md5checksum in malware_hashes:
    ...         print(""The file '%s' may be malicious"" % filename)

### Filtering of a Different Kind ###

In this hypothetical situation
suspicious activity in a chat room using set a comprehension:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; blacklist = {'windows', 'proprietary'}
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for line in chat_iostream:
    ...     words = {word.lower() for word in line.split()}
    ...     if words.intersection(blacklist):
    ...         os.kill(os.getpid()

The ""intersection"" method returns all elements shared between two sets
whenever the line contains unwanted content
the blacklist.

Similarly
indexing text by doing something like `keywords = allwords - commonwords`.

### Misc. Contrived Examples ###

Checking B-class IP diversity of servers hosted in the United States for a
hypothetical web hosting company (WARNING: Messy

    &gt;&gt;&gt; import webhost
    &gt;&gt;&gt; set(['.'.join(x[3].split('.')[:2]) for x in webhost.nodes if x[1].startswith('us') and 'cloud' not in x])
    {'27.48', '153.80', '02.66', '146.141', '158.164', '479.38', '153.180'}
    &gt;&gt;&gt; len(_)
    9

## Implementing Object Hashing ##


Sets rely on objects being hashable. Most objects in Python support being
hashed with the `hash` function. When you run `hash` on an eject
integral numeric hash:

    # Hash an integer
    &gt;&gt;&gt; hash(123)
    123

    # Hash a string
    &gt;&gt;&gt; hash('123')
    163512108404620371

    # Hash a tuple
    &gt;&gt;&gt; hash(('123'
    659470285131537468

When values are added to sets or dictionaries
fast look-ups.

For built-in primitives
same hash provided they're the same type
hashing method does not guarantee that objects with the same properties will
have the same hash:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; class A:
    ...     def __init__(self
    ...             self.x = x
    ...             self.y = y
    ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; thing = A(5)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; hash(thing)
    -9223363303958891749
    &gt;&gt;&gt; thing_two = A(5)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; hash(thing_two)
    -8732895884073

To fix this issue
and there are various approaches you can take to this. Here are a couple of
examples (note that I will be omitting the `__init__` function for brevity
assume it is unchanged from the above):

    &gt;&gt;&gt; # Hash using a tuple of attributes
    &gt;&gt;&gt; class A:
    ...     def __hash__(self):
    ...         return hash((self.x

    &gt;&gt;&gt; # Hash using a pre-existing repr string
    &gt;&gt;&gt; class A:
    ...     def __repr__(self):
    ...         classname = self.__class__.__name__
    ...         return str('%s(x=%r, self.y))
    ...     def __hash__(self):
    ...         return hash(repr(self))

For object factories like ORM's that may produce different objects representing
the same thing
relies on a key value for that object. Using an ORM object as an example
might derive the hash using only the database table's primary key:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; class WebsiteUser:
    ...     id = ORM.IntegerPrimaryKey()
    ...     username = ORM.TextField()
    ...     passwordhash = ORM.TextField()
    ...     #           ---
    ...     def __hash__(self):
    ...         return hash(self.id)

## Afterword ##

There are of certainly of other ways to use sets
basics and give you an idea of what you can do with them and how powerful they
can be. Oh

An Instruction Manual for Installing Python  


## 0. Intro

Installing Python packages is challenging
it
copy of Python 2.7.

After playing around with virtualenv a fair bit at home
use it at work to get two versions of Python living together. I also wanted
to figure out

This is a guide to doing those two things.

Note: I tested these instructions on Windows XP

## 1. Install Python

First
versions here: http://www.python.org/download/

* Install Python2.7 (using Windows installer)
* Install Python3.3 (using Windows installer)

## 1 a) If you want Python 2.7 as your default

I recommend installing the version you want as your default LAST.

If you want Python 2.7 as your default
variable when given the option during installation.

## 1 b) If you want Python 3.3 as your default:

Choose the option to add Python 3.3 to your Path. Since Python 2.7 doesn't
even try



## 2. Edit PATH variable

Regardless of whether you installed Python 2.7 or 3.3
you should do this anyway

* Press `Windows Key + Pause|Break` keys
OR
* click `Start`
* click `Advanced` tab
* click `Environment Variables`
* In the lower window
* Add `;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts` to the end of the PATH variable
* click `OK` 3 times!

(Note: Substitute `27` for `33` obviously

If you don't edit your path variable

    C:\&gt; pip install markdown2

but instead will have to do this:

    C:\&gt; C:\Python27\Scripts\pip install markdown2

Same with easy_install and virtualenv. So add `Scripts` to your path.

## 3. Install setuptools

You need ""setup\_tools"" first
first download a setup script called `ez_setup.py`. Save it anywhere
`C:\ez_setup.py`.

Here is the link:

https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/0.8/ez_setup.py

(If this seems weird and random

Then run it like this:

    C:\&gt; python ez_setup.py

(Note: the instructions here:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/0.8#windows)


## 4. Install pip using easy_install

Setuptools gives you a handy way to install packages:
You can now do this to get pip:

    C:\&gt; easy_install pip

## 5. Install virtualenv using pip

Now we have what we really wanted: pip
You can now do this to get virtualenv:

    C:\&gt; pip install virtualenv


**Alternatively:**

## 4 + 5: Install pip and virtualenv from installer

Install pip from here:

http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pip

Install virtualenv from here:

http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#virtualenv

Note that if you do this


## 6. Create Virtual Environment

Now that you have virtualenv

Our goal is to create just one new environment for the Python installation
that is NOT our default.

Now create your virtual env. The path at the end is the location where
your virtual environment will be stored. You can modify this to whatever
you want:

    C:\&gt; virtualenv --no-site-packages --python=C:\Python27\python.exe H:\Python\virtuals\py27

Obviously you replace `27` with `33` if you are already using 2.7 as your
default.

Note: --no-site-packages is probably the default
of virtualenv. Can't hurt to include it though. The opposite option is:
`--system-site-packages`

Note: You need setuptools
create your virtual environment!
(See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7446187/no-module-named-pkg-resources)


## 7. Activate Virtual Environments

Now

    C:\&gt; call H:\Python\virtuals\py27\Scripts\activate

You can deactivate an active virtual environment by typing `deactivate` any
time

You should see your command prompt change

    (py27) C:\&gt;

Indicating that the virtual environment is active. Now if you run `python`

(This applies to any virtual environment you set up

(Note: Packages such as [virtualenvwrapper](https://bitbucket.org/dhellmann/virtualenvwrapper) will make working with virtualenv easier. That being
said
and activate your environments the slow default way.)


## 8.1 Install Packages using pip

Now that an environment is active
pip

    C:\&gt; pip install markdown2
    C:\&gt; pip install openpyxl
    (etc...)

This installs them into your active virtual environment
default installation. So if you want a package in other virtual environments
you'll have to repeat this process. Or you can deactivate and just install stuff into your
default Python as well.

Note: If you installed all these packages in your default installation
can use `--system-site-packages` to include them in your virtual environments
so you only need to install them once.

## 8.2 Installing Packages using Windows installers

Not every package will install via `pip`
look up an executable installer. This list might help:

http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyodbc

However
So if I run the installer
it finds, it just so
happens you can do this:

* Download the package and save it
* Make sure your virtual environment is activated

    C:\&gt; easy_install C:\pyodbc.exe

Voila. It will install in your active virtual environment.

If this doesn't work
Python installation
use the `--system-site-packages`
[option](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/#the-system-site-packages-option)


## 9. Verify Installation

To verify that your installations worked

    C:\&gt; python

You should see that the correct version starts up
environment you have activated. To check that your modules installed
correctly

    &gt;&gt;&gt; import markdown2
    &gt;&gt;&gt; import pyodbc
    &gt;&gt;&gt; import openpyxl
    &gt;&gt;&gt;

If it works
an `ImportError`. In which case... good luck to you.

Repeat this process both after deactivating your virtual environment to
test your default installation.

God speed

1360171014.0,180ack,"[Announcement]New CSS, Rules, Guidelines, Wiki and First r/LearnPython AMA!",wub_wub,10, we have made some changes to this subreddit. Most noticeable ones are new CSS
and new sidebar with rules and guidelines for comments and submissions.

And we would love to hear your opinion on these changes
feedback on the subreddit.

Please upvote this submission so that other users can see it. I receive no karma for text-only posts.


*CSS/Rules/Guidelines*


**CSS Theme**

____

We're using modified [edurne](http://www.reddit.com/r/edurne) theme made by /u/rolmos. You can get it on
[github](https://github.com/rolmos/Edurne-CSS-Theme-for-Reddit/).

One of the most notable changes is that there are line numbers when you post code.
I've got the idea and most of the code from /r/learnprogramming subreddit where it was created by /u/zzyzzyxx and /u/trpcicm and introduced in [this ](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/160s2i/learnprogramming_change_your_code_blocks_now_have/)mod post

Example:

    a
    while b &lt; 10:
        print b
        a

As pointed out in the sidebar you can still use back-ticks to `mark something` inside the normal text.
**Rules/Guidelines**

____

As this subreddit continues to grow it has become more obvious that there need to be some guidelines and rules.

* There have been a lot of ""bad"" submissions which contained no code

The reason is that the users who created such posts just wanted someone to write the script for them

This subreddit is about learning python

* Also screenshots of the code are now forbidden. There is absolutely no advantage of posting screenshot instead of copying the text and pasting it

If the problem is visual you're allowed

**Guidelines**

Even though they are not rules you should treat them as such.

Completely ignoring them/not following them can get your post removed.

The most important ones are in bold. I initially had a 20 point list of rules but I cut it down. I would really like to hear your opinion of these guidelines and if you have suggestion on a new one

One that I'd like to point out is #1 in commenting guidelines. Is

&gt;Try to guide the poster to a solution instead of providing one directly.

Of course this can not always be followed
In complex scripts this can be a little hard to do

And as far as posting goes

&gt;Keep your code Short

If you have 100 line code that causes error when you try and open a file you should not include the whole script

*Even though I only pointed out 2 guidelines you should try and follow all of them as much as possible*

___

**r/LearnPython Wiki**

Since the sidebar is now filed with rules and guidelines we have moved all the sidebar content to the wiki.

The content is the same as one in the sidebar. But with wiki you can add the content yourself.

To be able to add content to the wiki you need an account that's older than 14 days. The requirements may change and you may also need some karma in this subreddit to edit wiki

I would like to encourage everyone to contribute to the wiki.

The are no contributing rules

If you vandalize wiki on purpose
____



**The AMA**


Thanks to /u/NYCMusicMarathon and his hist post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/17eqks/friend_of_exgoogle_employee_who_teaches_python/) and everyone who upvoted it. We will have David Blaikie do an AMA **this Friday at 11AM EST** We'll see if it will be answered right away or perhaps the next day depending on the amount of questions and Mr. Blaikie's time.

David Blaikie is a python coder

If this AMA turns out to be a success and if there's enough interest we'll try and get more people to do it.

That's about it...

I'm looking forward to hearing community's feedback on these changes/annoucments.

I've put this book together and refined it from year-to-year based on student feedback during 
their first semester of programming at [Simpson College](http://www.simpson.edu/computer-science). 
This is a first-semester course 
and assumes no prior knowledge of programming. I've successfully run hundreds of students 
through this course and had them create their own arcade games. Each time I refine the course 
and use their questions to make the book that much better.

The course can also be [taken on-line](http://programarcadegames.com/chapters/take_this_course.php)

I finished codecademy's python track yesterday

From [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1cehs5/my_new_book_hacking_secret_ciphers_with_python_is/) I was thinking of going through Mr. Sweigart's book. But I notice he has 3... Would I benefit from going through all of them? Should I do one at a time? I've also signed up for Rice university's An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python- but feel like I might get overwhelmed by their time schedule. I'm a little slow :(

Any other suggestions?

My goals are to be sufficient/proficient with Python for:

* ""hacking""/cryptography (security
* scientific applications (like pyMOL- I happen to need this quite often)
* Simple game development (ie
* Eventually move into phone app development (Which I suppose will be a transition to Java- for fun and to keep me mentally stimulated)

This is where I learn2python. It has taken me from a competent beginner to intermediate skill. I just saw one of their video's [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ar853/transforming_code_into_beautiful_idiomatic_python/) on /r/python and a basic google search showed they haven't been posted here. 

If you would like to learn python through hundreds of subject based lectures by many different people then I recommend you watch the videos there. They are lecture/seminar style and are a great compliment to the normal way of learning by reading module docs and [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) posts. With lengths between 20 minutes and 3 hours they can cover the detail on the subjects you really need. 

Wouldn't it be nice to be able to have a 3 hour video on how to use [matplotlib and numpy?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fp1zn5ao2M) [Or Learn how Youtube scaled up?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-lGCC4KKok&amp;list=PL2814D3290BAA8837&amp;index=39) [Or high performance Python?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJU3EYvTNXc)

Ever heard of [PyCon](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2814D3290BAA8837)? If not

I find these videos especially helpful because there are often great bits of knowledge sprinkled in that you would normally only get in very advanced classes

Ok

I thought it could be cool if you could use a list to keep track of a little video game characters stats.

    hero = [hp, and so on..]

So, but because I really am new at this, the only logic-y python tools I know are while loops and if statements.

Which would have been fine of course, when I realized I needed to step back, and make it better before I add even more to it.

Could somebody look at what I wrote and tell me if there is a easier way to do this? I feel like I'm missing something very elementary. Also... wanna play?

1348787778.0,10l8pm,Is there a secret club of bad programming habits?,its-all-too-much,38,9,19,"[ Throwaway account.  I don't wanna get fired ]

I've been a software developer for a long time now working in different cities, I'm handed legacy code that carries with it the same antipatterns:

* Short
* Files regularly in excess of 1500 lines.
* Models that do nothing but define database relationships and dozens of independent methods in a handful of massive util files
* Not breaking up methods into packages or directories, etc.
* Only one module: 99 models inside
* Redundant naming: `File.file_id`, ...
* Writing your own convoluted system when a fast &amp; efficient 3rd-party module would work fine

Now since I didn't go to school for this, or because no one has ever suggested that these aren't good patterns to follow?

Obviously there are edge cases for all of these where they might be suitable, on every legacy project I run into... we're not talking special circumstances here.  This is business as usual.

Honestly


**Edit**: Some people have asked what's wrong with these

1. **Short variable names** - It's about readability and understanding what someone has done months

2. **Long files** - while not necessarily bad

3. **Limited Models and great big utils** - Models are the authority on your data.  Not just repositories of information, you're not breaking your data up into logical places.  Also, I'm willing to bet that your `utils.py` file violates #2.

4. **Using `_` to separate things that should be in separate files** - This is a great example of procedural logic leaking into the object-oriented world.  If you've got a function called `compress_html_gzip`

        myfile = HTMLFile()
        myfile.compress()

        myotherfile = HTMLFile(compression=FILE.COMPRESSION_GZIP)
        myotherfile.compress()

    Separating your code into a bunch of very similar functions with similar names is a good hint that you should be using objects and not functions here.

5. **One module, dishes, and toiletries into a box called ""stuff"", sure it'll still transport your things, but good luck finding anything when the boxes arrive on the other side.

6. **Redundant naming** - This is just pointless.  If you've got a `cake` object


        cake = Cake(flavour=""chocolate"")
        print(cake.flavour) # This makes sense
        print(cake.cake_flavour) # This is redundant

    The only time where you'd need redundant naming is when you haven't bothered to name your variables appropriately:

        c = Cake(flavour=""chocolate"")
        print(c.flavour) # Now this is doesn't make sense
        print(c.cake_flavour) # Now this is necessary

7. **Writing your own code rather than using a module** - Obviously there are reasons to do this, and (b) teach new developers about your proprietary system since there's no way they could have heard of it before.  Use the tools everyone knows and you'll spend less time training people on how to use your special setup.  It'll also help you if/when your lead developer(s) decide to leave the project.",,False,,t5_2r8ot,1348845804.0,,

1353356716.0,13gu5j,The two Most Important things I unlearned about Java while picking up Python,abrightmoore,28,3,20,"I took a moment recently to reflect on the challenge of unlearning Java syntax when picking up Python.

1) Python cares about whitespace. In C and Java the { } braces are the way we group code and the layout of the code can vary wildly based on whether it has been written by a code god or minified. Python doesn’t mark it’s territory like this. instead python finds all the code for a given element (for, if/elif/else) by seeing if it is indented. That’s right. No more packing lines together. Your code has to be human readable to the computer too.

2) a for/next loop is radically different. In Python the “for” is an iterator and can work with lists of objects as well as integers. The syntax is:

for x in range(0

… And the preferred syntax for numeric loops is to use “xrange()” since this function does not actually create an instance of the list to be iterated over.

Got any other tips from your experiences?

I am proficient with python, increase my skill in python.

**What?**

My plan is to basically just write a bunch of programs with increasing difficulty and breadth and document my progress.  

I am going to post the programs I write here. The first ones will be simple
 
I plan to explore:

* regular expressions (haven't used them yet)
* many different data structures (suggestions helpful)
* GUI
* Network programming
* optimization algorithms (simplex, suggestions welcome)
* some A.I. agents that are not excessively difficult without logical programming languages
* Games

I am not sure over what period of time this will all occur

**Why?**

If you are learning anything similar to what I am working on

I want to write code in a way that is readable to beginners.  The people I code for in the future likely will not have much programming experience.  So definitely critique any unnecessary ways in which I do things.

I want to join the python community

I think it would be a fun project to follow if it wasn't me doing it.

I want feedback on what sorts of things would be good to have in a portfolio as I move forward into my IT career path.

And how to use all it's features can be found here:

https://praw.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html

The following steps is for PCs and Python 2.7 users:

FIRST do this: 


http://stackoverflow.com/posts/15294806/revisions


""Be sure that your Windows environment variable PATH includes Python's folders (for Python 2.7.x: C:\Python27 and C:\Python27\Scripts).""


What that means is click START

Then SETTINGS 

Then CONTROL PANEL 

Then click on the SYSTEM icon

Then click the tab ADVANCE at the upper right

Then click ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES at bottom middle 

Then in the SYSTEM VARIABLES box - find PATH and edit to include:  

;c:\Python27;c:\Python27\Scripts 


For some reason the Cs only work for me if they are lowercase


These steps with pictures are also outlined at the bottom of this page:


http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~rosario/classes/07F/202a/python/index.html

And in this video:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddpYVA-7wq4 


STEP TWO:


""Run this one line command on your prompt

python -c ""import urllib2;f=urllib2.urlopen('http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py').read();exec(f)"" &amp; easy_install pip

""

What this means is click START 

Then click RUN...

Enter CMD 

Click OKAY 

This will open up a CMD.EXE window. In this window


STEP THREE:


http://stackoverflow.com/a/8020986


In the CMD.EXE window

easy_install praw 

Hit enter and the computer will install the PRAW program for you.

AND THAT'S IT! 

Now you can open up your IDLE

1332022842.0,r1auw,Book Review: Making Games with Python and Pygame,ryosen,26,5,3,"""Making Games with Python and Pygame"" is the second in a series of tutorial books from Al Sweigart. Knowing that it can often be a somewhat tedious affair, animation and sound. Well

""Making Games with Python and Pygame"" is divided up into ten chapters. Over the course of the book

Each chapter follows the same basic formula. First is a brief description of the game that will be created and how it works. Next, section by section, with a thorough explanation of what the code does and why it does it. At the end of the chapter, is often ideas for expanding the game and a link to ""buggy"" versions of the game that you can use to practice debugging techniques. The buggy versions can all be downloaded and each version tells you exactly what is wrong with the code. In fact, the book makes several references to supplemental material to be found on the book's website. 

One thing about the chapters that I really appreciated was the way that they are organized. Each section of code has its own subchapter heading. This makes it very easy to find information on that section or, comparing the working source code to a version where the game character isn't displayed on the screen as expected. This is the first time that I've seen this concept applied and it's a wonderful tool.

Here is a quick breakdown of the chapters and the topics that they cover:

Chapter 1 introduces you to the intent of the book and a few other preliminaries such as getting Python and Pygame installed. 

Chapter 2 covers the basics of the game loop, graphic surfaces (canvases), basic drawing, animation and sound manipulation, and more. It also explains how to manage how fast the screen is drawn (refresh rates and frames per second). These are all very important ideas to understand before you can tackle the games themselves and Sweigart does an excellent job of leading you through them.

Chapter 3 introduces you to your first game, etc), as well as coordinate systems. It also introduces you to some nice additional features - basic animations for starting and ending the game. 

Chapter 4 has you creating a Sliding Numbers puzzle. Key concepts such as keyboard and mouse input, so it looks like the puzzle is being unshuffled. It might sound like a small thing but it helps to add a level of ""professionalism"" to the game. Especially for a beginner, it helps to give them the feeling that they have created something special. Little touches like this are spread throughout the remaining chapters.

Chapter 5 is built around a Simon-type (copy me) game. For those that may not remember Simon, that light up and play a sound in sequence. The player then has to push each button in the same sequence. The longer you play, the longer the sequences get. This chapter focuses on the use of sound and controlling it, as well as using time as a feature. It also focuses on a bit of flair called an ""attractor"". An attractor is often used when a game is sitting idle. This is very common in arcade coin-op games where they will play an animation or sound clip to get your attention. You'll also see it used in games where you control a character on-screen (a la Mario Brothers or Braid) and let them sit idle for a bit and they start to get ""bored"". They'll start tapping their toes or looking around, maybe whistle... Those actions are all possible with the attractor logic and ""idle state"" taught in this chapter.

Chapter 6 uses the classic Snake game, his approach to tracking the snake on the playing field and rendering it is very similar to managing levels and drawing their maps onscreen in RPGs. This concept is expanded on later in Chapter 9. Text rotation is also introduced for the title screen.

Chapter 7 expands on what has been learned so far with a Tetris clone. Here we're getting into complex shape manipulation, on-screen elements are kept track of by using an array to store an object's boundaries, but it works and it works very well. Using the concepts learned here, you can track a complex object in space and move it around with some interaction with the environment (e.g. walls and other pieces). This is revisited again in Chapter 9. A strong emphasis on game logic is the underlying theme of this section and it helps prepare the reader to create more complex games. 

Chapter 8 brings autonomous characters into the mix as you create a simple variation of Katamari Damacy. You basically take control of a squirrel that runs around eating other smaller squirrels while avoiding being eaten by larger ones. As you consume the other objects, which is alluded to with a reference to Super Mario World). This basically allows you to create games that have very large playing areas while only showing a small section at a time. You also learn how to do some basic sprite movement to make it appear as if your character is jumping/bouncing with the introduction of the Sine mathematical function. Also nice to have if you want to throw a ball up in the air and have it come back down realistically. Not content to show you how to merely move the screen's camera around, a little bit of flair is introduced that gives the player's character some ""slack"" where he can move on the screen before the camera moves, as well as brief invulnerability when the player first spawns.. Again, just a nice thing to see in a book directed towards beginners. 

Chapter 9 is not the last chapter but it is the one that ties everything together in one really nice setup. Here the game is Star Pusher, collision detection, and more graphic techniques. Upon completion of this chapter, you will have just about everything you could need to build a 2D game.

Chapter 10 finishes things up with four additional games that you can use to reinforce what you have learned and discover new techniques. The games included are variants of Othello, and Bejeweled. Of special importance here is the introduction of basic A.I. concepts in Othello and Connect Four.

1372944989.0,1hms30,A Python tournament for beginners?,RideMyLightning,25,5,27,"Hey guys

I just thought of this and decided to post it so I can see if you're interested

So I was thinking about setting up a tournament that lasts as long as summer does

I planned on making teams/groups based on experience. Groups are awesome; you can learn tricks from each other, but that number can be influenced by your opinions and the number of participants. When I get informed that a certain group, or certain members of a group, show they can't cooperate, I might change groups or exclude those members from the tournament. I imagine there will be some people that aren't able to participate during the whole thing, maybe I can make a list of 'replacements'; people that replace others that are going on holiday or whatever, to keep the teams (more or less) even.

The challenges still have to be made and help/ideas are welcome. Maybe it's a good idea to include some learning-stuff and make the challenge around that?

I cannot do this on my own however. I am able to make teams, but I'm in no way an experienced programmer. So I made a list containing the things I need:

- Participants 
- Some more experienced programmers
- Maybe also some experienced programmers
- Ideas for challenges

For the required level/experience I guess something like being able to write a simple piece of code and being familiar with the basic syntax of Python? 

Oh and lastly, but a group containing everyone might be interesting?

That's about it I guess. Remember

EDIT: This are possible challenges:

1. Draughts/checkers. The follow-up challenge (or bonus) could be chess.
2. A Pokémon battle simulation (the concepts
3. Create a (textbased) game. Quite vague
4. How to solve a Rubic's Cube. Don't know if this is possible

* What time zone to use when you only need to deal time in a desktop application on the local computer ? (is it ok to use time.time() ? The documentation states the following: ""... not all functions are available on all platforms. ... the semantics of these functions varies among platforms.""
* What methods/libraries to use when you have to deal with multiple platforms ?
* In what time zone to store time in a web application ?
(Is it better to store every timevalue in GMT everywhere
* What are the biggest mistakes you can make while working with time and how to avoid those ?
* What mistakes are hard to notice when you make them ?
* What is the best way to convert time to human readable strings ?
* What is the best way to parse date strings dealing with incorrect inputs ?
* Is it ok to parse date strings with regular expressions which have a well-known format ? What if the format is not very-well known ?
* How to write regexes (or methods) when time format might be different every time in the input but it is important to correctly identify it ?
* I usually prefer storing time in timestamp (second since unix epoch)

1351739546.0,12ftjx,Let's talk about learning resources. Which are best for which people?,callmelucky,22,3,16,"Hi there.

I've been teaching myself Python for roughly a month (having absolutely zero prior programming experience)

[**Learn Python The Hard Way:**](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)  
This was the first resource I made use of. I do see a lot of value in it, and just has you copying out a lot of code and running it, without really explaining what is happening. It seems the principle is that you jump in, run the code, and then try to work out what it's doing by inspecting the results. As someone who likes to know what I am doing before I do it, this approach made me a little uneasy. Also, the 'FAQs' at the bottom of each lesson seem to be just straight up replies to each question posted in the comments, and, just doesn't suit my personal style.

[**Udacity CS101:**](http://www.udacity.com/view#Course/cs101/CourseRev/apr2012/Unit/671001/Nugget/675002)  
This was the second resource I got into, with a mature and level tone. Quizzes and exercises are nicely paced, and there are extra sets of 'homework' for each unit if you want to really reinforce your new knowledge. This is also one of the few resources I have looked at that *actually* assumes no prior programming experience. I found it quite annoying in a lot of other resources I looked into which claimed to be laid out for complete programming noobs, yet they are riddled with ""much like in C, in Python you can do such-and-such to blah blah blah"". Let me make this clear to resource builders: I HAVE NEVER USED C OR ANY OTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. Anyway, as I said, Udacity is by far my favourite

[**Khan Academy:**](http://www.khanacademy.org/cs)  
The perennial favourite. Khan Academy is really good. Nicely structured, but really, as an online video resource, you *can* just skip back if you feel like you didn't quite grasp something that was said. For this reason, I left Khan Academy after the first 4 or 5 lessons, and headed back to Udacity.

[**PySchools:**](http://www.pyschools.com/)  
Urgh. I'm sorry, and then continued to be annoyed with its waaay too minimal (read: lazy) site layout. The lists of sections/units on the main page are not hyperlinked. When you get an exercise right it skips immediately to the next exercise without so much as a 'You got it right!'. The text is often on a background of extremely poor contrast such as to make it almost unreadable. It doesn't show you a running total of your score as you progress. There are no 'next' and 'previous' buttons on the exercises. For a site made by programmers for programmers it seems to be incredibly lazily put together. That said, the exercises themselves certainly have value, but I just can't be bothered using that atrocious site.

This demo takes a screenshot

**Some specific questions for you:**

1) is this really using BRISK? I found in the opencv source code where it passes the 'BRISK' name to Algorithm
   but then I can't find where Algorithm is actually loading things up to see if BRISK is really there.

2) Do you see any specific errors in my explanations or use of opencv?

3) Do you know how to set parameters on BRISK to make the demo more flexible?

4) Do you know how to create the AGAST detector that is used in the BRISK research paper?

- install [opencv](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/) (&gt;= 2.4.3) (but I've included a code path that imports opencv from a binary included in the repository if you don't feel like installing opencv (it may only work in windows though. I don't know).

I am doing learnpythonthehardway exercise 36 and writing my own textbase adventure game. 

I decided to put a combination lock in the game.

the code looks like this:

    def promptme() :

	next = raw_input(""&gt; "")

    def lock1():
	
	code = ['3'
	passed = False

	while True:
		typewrite(""What are the 3 numbers you want to try?""+ ""\n"")
		typewrite(""Or would you rather leave?"" + ""\n"")
		promptme()
		usercode = next.split(' ')

		if usercode[0] == code[0] and usercode[1] == code[1] and usercode[2] == code[2] :
			typewrite(""The correct code was entered. Rest of the game under developement! You won!"" + ""\n"")
			exit(""You won the game!"")

		elif (usercode[0] == code[0] and usercode[1] == code[1] and usercode[2] != code[2]) or (usercode[0] == code[0] and usercode[1] != code[1] and usercode[2] == code[2]) or (usercode[0] != code[0] and usercode[1] == code[1] and usercode[2] == code[2]) :

		elif ""leave"" in next.lower():
			typewrite(""You decieded to go back!"")
			room1()
		else:
			typewrite(""You pressed the three numbers,typewrite(""Probably the wrong numbers."")



Needless to say

As you could see, so does with 3 2 5 or 3 2 9, but if i try something like 5 2 7 then the code fails and does not recognize that the second number was correct. 

This code is a bit messed now since i tried to figure out how it would work

Thank you guys!


**Edit**: Epic facepalm now. Sorry for the false alarm guys. Turns out i actually solved the issue i just worked so hard on it for quiet long that i messed up the correct combination when i tried to run the game.... of course it didnt work. I need to sleep its 22:16 here....

I'm working on a program that gets your current playing song from a music player program that you select (Desktop applications such as spotify

This program is written in python 2.7.3 and uses PySide's QT link for the GUI.

Now, probably more to come.

Now

    win32gui.EnumWindows(Main.examineWindow

    windowTitle = win32gui.GetWindowText(hwnd)
 
What this does

For example
Spotify would have the following title:
    
    Spotify - Foo - Bar

My program checks for the 'Spotify - ' part

Now

Luckily though
 
    iTunes = win32com.client.gencache.EnsureDispatch(""iTunes.Application"")
    return iTunes.CurrentTrack.Name + ' ' + iTunes.CurrentTrack.Artist

However

I've been reading up a lot on this. And I've come to a vague conclusion that most music players do have some api-ish accessibility (A great example is that a lot of players have remote controls

From what I've seemed to make from it

I have no idea what the code exactly means in my iTunes implementation above. I could easily understand the stuff that happened after it though (iTunes.CurrentTrack.name? That's readable :P)

So

* Is it possible to do what I want to do? (in python?)

* If not directly

* WTH are dll's?

* Could any of you give me some better directions?

First off just wanted to thank the subreddit for being a resource in my decision to first learn python and in starting that journey.  I find myself though with a problem to solve, but there's a project I need to get done quicker that has been stumping me.  I'm at a loss for where to even start, so let me describe what I had in mind.  It's based around the ideas of randomization and balanced allocation.  I'm at University for Cognitive Science and was looking to develop a tool to help me with randomizations of experimental conditions.  Specifically...

I start with `x` number of images.  For this project it is 64, next 16 to group 2, etc.  But I haven't figured out a way in my head for the program to keep trying new randomizations and assignments so that each image appears in each group the same amount.  

Any help that a beginner could understand would be greatly appreciated!  Of course if anyone took a quick jot of it and wanted to pass along some code that would be phenomenal as well.

If you want another format, whatever). 

I'm trying to teach one of my friends programming, so instead of trying any more of the language, I sat down with him and he went through the functions and played with them for a while, trying to find a use for them (so he could remember it later). 

This was a) more fun, I don't yet after programming for two years), but having a list he can check, and having something to try out when he gets bored has been pretty handy so far.

There's some comments, but I figured I'd share this with the community to see how useful / not useful it is.

I strongly encourage you to sit down with the plain vanilla interpreter to play with these, parse the error, and see if you can avoid using `help()`. It will stick better if you have experience with a function, rather than just reading a sentence or two about a function.

I posted my first project to Github today (and was really thoroughly blown away by how awesome Github is

Now, the program seems to work as advertised, but I thought it might be instructive to share it with the pros and if anyone has any comments on it, I will happily take them. 

I'm still working on it in order to clean up the data and do a bunch of other things I want to do. This project was inspired by the desire to know more accurately what the ocean water temperature and wind speeds and current swell data were before I went to the beach

The people over at /r/surfing asked me to put it in github

A few notes:

* I have a plain-text config file with username/password combination inside. This is probably a terrible way to do this, but it didn't occur to me anyone would be interested. I figure, though, that by sharing I can learn the right way to do stuff.

1369194759.0,1etalt,Best way to avoid nested if blocks and code duplication?,exoplasm,18,4,17,"I have a script that reads through text files one line at a time and does regex matching to find specific items in each line. I am checking all regex patterns on each line

I'm also storing all my results in a dictionary where each value is also a dictionary. I should probably use a class or classes for that instead

Here's some brief psuedo code to keep it simple so you can understand what I'm doing (no this is not how I really name my variables):

    regex1 = re.compile('some complicated regex')
    regex2 = re.compile('just a string of words')
    #many more similar variables go here ...

    for line in file:
        find1 = regex1.search(line)
        find2 = regex2.search(line)
        #repeating for every regex pattern declared above ...

            if find1:
                    #do some string formatting and add items to dictionary

                        #dictionary adding from above ...
            #more if blocks out here as well ...

As you can see this gets messy quick and my code does not adhere to the DRY principle very well; lots of copy-pasting to handle string formatting and such.

In the course the instructor constantly reminds the viewer about immutable data types but at first glance the idea seems to contradict itself when you can do a = ""cat"", etc.

I believe I've come to understand that the ""a"" in the above example is merely a label that points at the ""object"" in memory

Where I'm a bit fuzzy is if you set a = ""cat"" and then do a = a.capitalize(). I think that the a.capitalize() becomes a new ""object"" that grabs the existing value of ""a"" and is then independent of the original ""a"" value. The original ""a"" value is then eventually garbage collected out but the new object that the ""a"" label is pointing to will not be affected by that value disappearing.

So am I correct in that or am I still mistaken? -_-

Also I might as well throw this question in: what is the most efficient way to do the following (compensating for the user input with strip and capitalize methods)? I'm thinking there is a way to do it in one line

I just completed codecademy's course on Python and decided to try my luck with API's.

The bit.ly, so I decided to use Discogs' as a start.

So here's my code.

    import discogs_client as discogs
    #from urllib2 import urlopen
    
    discogs.user_agent = 'removed for now'
    
    artist_input = raw_input(""Enter artist\'s name : "")

        print ""Server is a bit sleepy
    else:
            print ""Artist : "" + artist.name
            print ""Description : "" + str(artist.data[""profile""])
            print ""Members :""
            members = artist.data[""members""]
            for index
                if index == (len(members) - 1):
                    print name + "".""
                else:    
                    print name + ""
                    
            print ""Albums :""
            
            #Gathering only MasterReleases and not every possible release in every format(LP
            thereleases = [master for master in artist.releases if 'MasterRelease' in str(type(master))]
            for index
                if index == (len(thereleases) - 1):
                    print name.title + "".""
                else:    
                    print name.title + ""

My questions are:

1)When i want to print the albums

2)What's the benefits of using Discogs_client and not the urllib2 package way as i saw in let's say placekitten example. (or [this guy's code]( https://code.google.com/p/jwsandbox/source/browse/trunk/Discogs/discogs.py))

3)Can you provide me some links in order to get a better understandment of python - API interaction?

4)Also

    print thereleases[0].data

i get MASSIVE feedback and i can hardly work around it. How can i organize the JSON (i hope i'm right) in order to be more readable? Even in notepad or something.


Feel free to point and suggest anything

1365775390.0,1c7f9h,Security rules of thumb for beginner trying Django or Flask?,JFic,16,1,12,"I've gotten through a few intro Python tutorials

When I stumbled upon [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb-K40mkhEU), the tutorial video brings one pretty close to the point of opening up one's computer to external attacks. The title ""Dangerous Stuff"" and the cautionary words near the end of the tutorial provide sufficient warning in this case, but I began wondering whether other tutorials might lead me to open vulnerabilities without warning me. 

I'm hoping reddit folks can give me a few rules of thumb so that I can stay smart about security while still having fun as I experiment with Django and Flask. 

For instance

Or maybe I should take additional precautions? Some tutorials mention sandboxing your system before you start. I'll definitely do that if it's necessary. If it's not though

I have no idea whether this matters: although I usually save my work on a public repo on GitHub

The questions above are pretty much blind guesses

I've completed most of LPTHW and I'm not all that impressed by it.  It does a good job of teaching the basics of Python but I don't feel like I can do anything with the knowledge. This became clear when I tried to do some of the Project Euler exercises and then looked at some of the solutions.

For instance the most popular solution to Problem #2 uses:

    x

Which requires unpacking a tuple.  LPTHW introduced tuples in lesson 48 but only in one paragraph.  Looking at the code above I was totally clueless until I read an explanation of it i another post here. I get it now but theres no way I could adapt the concept into code of my own at this point.  The second popular solution requires importing ""itertools"" which I had never heard of before.  Where does one learn all of this stuff?

I've put this book together and refined it from year-to-year based on student feedback during 
their first semester of programming at [Simpson College](http://www.simpson.edu/computer-science). 
This is a first-semester course 
and assumes no prior knowledge of programming. I've successfully run hundreds of students 
through this course and had them create their own arcade games. Each time I refine the course 
and use their questions to make the book that much better.

1303619269.0,gw4rq,"No, seriously, *how* do I learn Python?",ferebend,16,16, don't have the mind of a programmer... help?

Now the full version.

Backstory: I'm a linguist. An experimental linguist; the type that collects real data and has to do a bunch of stuff with it. At the moment, I have no idea how to fix it and I have to bug my very busy supervisor with questions along the lines of ""Something is wrong... fix it please?"" This isn't a very sustainable situation, so I'm taking it upon myself to learn Python.

Problem: There are tons of resources out there, it would be great if, while learning, I'd come across things like ""Here are some example practical applications of this kind of variable/function/whatever."" I don't see that a lot. I'm also not very good at reverse engineering things. I tend to need to learn things from the ground up and I rely on my intuition to get me where I want to go quickly and efficiently.

I'm trying to display a low-resolution webcam stream onto a higher resolution surface. I've got the webcam stream showing up on the screen

I'm not sure how/where to use the pygame.Surface.scale() function so some help in how that works would be great.

What I want is an app that will have three input fields. These fields will labeled 'location 1'

I have no formal experience with either flask or html but I do okay getting around python. I found a [tutorial](https://www.dropbox.com/s/khendnc4uen1ekr/hello.py) online for an easy hello world example that uses an input to generate the second page.

My first issue is that I am not sure how to get two input fields


    return render_template_string(""""""&lt;html&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            Hello {{ name | escape }}!
            &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;""""""


is the part where it assigns the input of the user to a variable in my script..also i figured that just creating another:

 
    &lt;form action='{{ url_for('sayhello') }}'&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;Please enter your name&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;input type='text' name='name' /&gt;
            &lt;input type='submit' value='Enter' /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;


would create another field on the app

I feel like if someone were to eli5 how to do that, or at least get a bit further...

Eventually I want this to take the location 1, one that lists all the entries chronologically, in a table (columns//rows) and way down the road the second page would (hopefully) display a nice line graph of availability over time, for a given mm/dd/yy. Once I have my data set I'm confident in my ability to sort it out over different time periods (day, week, month) and whatnot, its just getting to that point that I have no experience with.

I don't think that is quite correct

Is it possible to write a text adventure with navigation and so with my basic knowledge?
Should i wait a bit longer before tackling this project? Maybe do a static adventure where you only have to choose actions to do and then are moved to the next room automatically?

Because of this, cleaning it up to show as a OOP vs. Imperitive vs. Functional style, then I found [this](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips#Avoiding_dots...) .

It basically says (and I understand this part..) that accessing methods on a class in an iteration is slower

Ok.

So I've gone from this:


     block = list(gigantic_data)
     for x in y:
          block.append(x)

to:

     block = list(gigantic_data)
     append = list.append
     for x in y:
          append(block

Which *is* quicker. Granted

I quote:

&gt; Python accesses local variables much more efficiently than global variables. 

Could this be because namespaces are essentially dictionaries and that a local namespace containing fewer attributes that the lookup time is smaller? I thought that dictionary lookup was `O(1)` for dictionaries?

Is there some *different* implementation for local scoping name lookup than there is for the global scope?

 I had to look for an intership (in France) and most requiered languages were : PHP (Zend/Symfony2)/js, C++, C#, .Net, RoR and Python.  


What I would like to know is :  

* What do corporations need using Python?
* Is there anything that Python excels at?
* Any other learning ressources?  
* Is learning Python really worth it (I know that learning one more language can't be bad!) or should I rather focus on things like PHP or Java (I know that Django is a Python framework and can be used alongside with PHP) taking into account that I'll graduate in 2015?

As far as I know I cannot use `os.chmod` or `os.chown`

I am sure this has to be something simple I'm missing but I cannot seem to figure it out. 

Any help would be great!

I had to remove the `open(fn

Obviously the Tkinter stuff is from the GUI so no worries there. What I can't figure out is what is the 3rd argument I need to give `GetNamedSecurityInfo()` I'll keep banging away at this and keep updating as I figure it out.

Sometimes I think just writing it down helps me work through the issues. Thanks for reading!

**Edit 2:**I think I almost have it. See updated code [Here](https://gist.github.com/nrmjba/5714268).

At this point i have gotten it to assign all of the needed permissions but under Special Permissions instead of the standard Full Control I was looking for. I am not sure of the implications of this but at least I can change the permissions of the folders now. 

Still working on this so any input is appreciated! Thanks! 

**Edit 3:**Ok almost done. got all the actual file stuff figured out with the help of u/lsakbaetle3r9. For the record I ended up using `os.system` with the `cacls`command and changed permissions that way.

Hi all

I'm playing with modular residue of large powers and moduli.  I've become frustrated with how slowly my script works and have been looking online for coding and mathematical help to reduce the calculation time.

the basic Gist is this....


    a=4**2**(n-2)
    b=2**n-1
    c=a%b
    if c==2:
          #report result

As you can imagine

    x=4
    p=2**(n-2)
    m=2**n-1
    while p&gt;1:
         p//=2
         x*=x
         x=x%m
    if x==2:
         #return result

While still deathly slow, I've found that :
 
    for n in range(num):
        pow(4

Takes similar time to:

    for n in range(num):

2: Define functions, anything, really, in your resources file.

3: In your main program

1. I'm aware that variables (unless declared as global) only exist within the function that they are declared in.
2. I have a rudimentary understanding of why global variables are generally a bad idea (mutable outside of the function
you're using them in and so unexpected results might occur).

Feel free to correct me on the above if it's wrong!

The question is


For example: 

	def functionOne():
		
		x = 1

		return x

	def functionTwo(x): #want to make use of the returned variable from functionOne.
		
		
		x = x*2
		

	def main():

		functionOne()
		functionTwo()
		
		print(x)

	if __name__ ==""__main__"":
		main()
		
I'm aware that I could do something like this:

	def functionOne():
		
		x = 1

		functionTwo()
		

	def functionTwo(x):
		
		#manipulate the variable defined in functionOne
		x = x*2
		
		print(x)
		

	def main():

		functionOne()
		
		
	if __name__ ==""__main__"":
		main()

For learners:     
- What has been helpful to you in the past as you learn Python? Any specific explanations that provided ""ah-ha!"" moments?     
- What has been frustrating? Are there certain things that have just not been well-explained to you?    
- Any other input for me? 

For the more seasoned Pythonistas:    
My plan is to break it into 3 sessions of ~2hrs each. The first hour should be me demonstrating and explaining, working alone and asking questions if they need help. Topic breakdown for the 3 sessions are thusly:    
1. Some philosophical and pragmatic issues: why program, then variables (small introduction to the notion of data types), flow (if-else, loops), probably functions, and, at the end
2. More in-depth look at data types, to showcase some of the convenience there. At this point, it's possible to make an implementation of a simple card game (or at least a deck of cards), but that's kind of boring... so I'm open to suggestions as to what to do for a (small) 'closing project'.    
3. The third will be a recap of the first two, dealing with basic NLP stuff (it'll be a group of linguists, so that's relevant) and we can do some basic word counting stuff to answer fun but trivial questions about a text corpus. My initial plan was to find a corpus, clean it, and then do analysis but I think that might be too ambitious. 

I guess my question is: is this too rigorous? There'll be a week between classes with 'homework' (practice exercizes) assigned but probably not done. Are there things I should be sure to go into? Are there things I should be sure to avoid? Is the pacing too fast? Too slow?

If you noticed in your code a pattern like this:

    list_a = [4, 7]
    for i in range(len(list_a)):
        print ""Item at index %d is %d"" % (i

You can reduce a lot of the clutter by using enumerate:

    list_a = [4, 7]
    for i
        print ""Item at index %d is %d"" % (i


Why is this important? Well, or need to ensure indexes are correctly matched with values, enumerate solves these problems. It also makes your code cleaner and there is less chance of a bug appearing when using indexes of lists.

Won't that use a lot of memory - creating a new list like that? No,2,1])"" - it won't print the values, just the generator expression. To get the values use it in a loop, or use ""list(enumerate([3,2,1]))"".

Technical details: the enumerate function takes a list and returns a generator, where index is equal to range(len(list)) and value is the value of thelist at the given index.

Thanks to help on here

So step 2 now is to automate the process entirely (which also means I can process more frequently than beofre - daily instead of weekly).

The issue I'm having is the way the script works is it:

* Poplib to find report emails and save attachment locally
* zipfile to unzip the the attchment
* finally csv to write the content to a single csv file

Well now instead of writing it to a csv file I just want to compile the content from all attachments and display them on a url. Then I can set up a cronjob so this happens daily and this way there will be a nice daily breakdown of all our accounts.

The issue here is how do I process the attachments without saving them locally first? I want this script to just run on the server

Goal 1 - reproduce exactly what I already had

Goal 2 - improve and add extra features


What's the script's purpose?
- To count the query throughput from a log file (i.e. how many entries per second/minute/hour)


The log file has a standard format like this:


INFO : [query] [2012/12/10 19:19:51.819] 0c9250e0-3272-4e2c-bab4-0a4fd88e0d75     this is a test line


Here's the script: https://gist.github.com/4374180

And here's a test log file: https://gist.github.com/4374226


Some stuff I thought about adding:

- Make it more generic so it can work with other log formats

- Add extra output formats (right now it's just simple csv)

- Automatically create nice graphs from the results

- Pull log files from remote locations through ssh

- Specify ignore patterns (right now it ignores DEBUG lines since that's what I needed)


I would love to hear if this works for you and what I could improve in terms of efficiency and style!

So I'm around lesson 40 something in LPTHW where we have to design our own game. I really enjoy poker so I thought I'd make a really short and simple heads-up poker game.

I would really like to make a class or SOMETHING that has basically a list of commands for the bot(or Villain in my code's case) to do when reacting to certain bet amounts and based off of his own holdings. How would I go about doing something like this? Here's beginner attempt to start this: 
    
    import random

    pocket_pairs = ['AA', 'JJ', 'TT', '99', '88', '77', '66',
				'44'
    cards = pocket_pairs[random.randint(0

     print ""You are dealt %s"" % cards
     from villain import villain_shows #this is from a different module that basically is the same as the 
                                       #cards/pocket_pairs variables. Not sure if it was the right way to go  
                                       #about giving villain a different set of cards

    class PreFlop(object):

	      def __init__(self):
		     self.VillainPreFlop = VillainPreFlop()

	      def bet(self):
		     print ""how much do you want to bet?""
		
		     hero_bet = raw_input(""&gt; $"")
		     print ""Hero bets $%s"" % hero_bet
		     villain.action()
				
		
    class VillainPreFlop(object):
	
	       def action(self):
	
		      if hero_bet &gt; 10:
			     print ""villain folds""
		      else:
			     print ""villain flips table over""
			
     villain = VillainPreFlop()
     preflop = PreFlop()

     preflop.bet()

As you probably can tell

[Monkeyget](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/lpkwe/comparing_variables_a_question_on_a_codingbat/c2ul2jy) has offered a legitimate reason for using the last2 variable:

&gt;It may be a bit less efficient than the other implementation. You slice str at every iteration of the loop while the other implementation creates the last2 variable once and reuses it.

Each file contains information about a specific object (for example, ""color"", etc.), as well as a reference to an object in a different file (owner.xml lists all cars owned by the owner, which you can look up in cars.xml). The idea is that you can search for a car owner, and you will get a list of all the car he owns, as well as some information about the model of each car and the company that manufactures the car.

I would like some advice on the design of the program. At the moment, I have a car class, a model class, and so on), and then it ""connects"" the objects, meaning that the cars in the car class have an attribute that points to the relevant model class object.

This time i tried to modify the 35th exercise and bumped into a little problem. I have to ask here because I am not even sure how to shape this question into googleable form.

The problem is the following:

This is the line of code that i have a problem with.
What is happening is that i ask for a raw input for ""next"". 
Then i just want to give options the user to answer. But to make it more friendly i would like to make this program accept answers like ""Taunt the damn bear"". So I'd like python to check like ""If taunt and bear is in the answer (they don't have to be exactly ""taunt bear"") then do the following procedure: xxx

I tried a couple of ways

    elif next.lower() in ""taunt"" + ""bear"" and not bear_moved :
    elif next.lower() in (""taunt"" + ""bear"") and not bear_moved:
    elif next.lower() in (""taunt"" and ""bear"") and not bear_moved :

Here's the summarized example:

Say that you want to get the price of an item in your shopping cart. You receive the data/items in tuples

    def getPrice(object):

    &gt;&gt;&gt; object.getPrice()

-------------------------

So the author wrote that last part `object.getPrice()` without any explanation of what the function would look like. Would it be basically this?

1372250915.0,1h3rph,Need another set of eyes on this simple Python app (and some questions),TeamTuck,9,2,8,"Hello everyone.  I am a CIT instructor at a technical college and have come up with a small C++ app to clock students in and out (some have coop jobs and it's hard to keep track of 20-40 students).  The app I created (C++ version) earlier this year has worked out quite well

Most of the app is ready to go and the basic functionality is there.  There are just a few things I need another set of eyes on

Disclaimer:  This is my first Python app (more than the basic stuff) so don't judge me.  I've basically pieced tutorials together since that's how I learn programming the best.

This app is extremely simple:  there are two listboxes(available students and present students) with Clock In, select it and click on the Clock in Button.  Done.  If they have to leave early, they can find their name in the PStudents listbox, select it and click on the Clock out Button.  All of these actions get written out into a log file (log file is named after the MM/DD/YYYY format), then another Python script emails it to the instructor.

I do have future plans on adding more things such as passwords for each student

1) I have built in a ""resume"" feature to where if a student accidentally exits/closes the program, input the first name in the text file into the PStudent listbox, but give the error ""TclError: bad listbox index ""Cecil Huffines"": must be active, anchor, end, @x,y, 1

Maybe there is another way to accomplish a resume feature that I haven't thought of?

2) As I mentioned, and each student is here for 6 hours a day (take out lunch and breaks) for our attendance records.  I would like the logs to say:

John Doe
Clocked in at 8:00
Clocked out at 1:00
Present for 4.5 hours

Each time that I try to look up information on how to calculate time

3) If a student has not clocked in and they accidentally press the Clock Out button, but console throws out an error message stating that the ""tuple index out of range"".  Any way to correct this?

I think that's all I have right now.  This app is decently solid as it stands but needs some dummy proofing.  My eyes can't take any more code at the moment

I would like to do something like this:

    ace_spades = BlackJackCard('ace'

so in the following problems

    # False or not True and True
    bool_one = False


working from the Order of operations:

    False or not True and True

because not True == False...

    False or False and True

because False and True == False...

    False or False

because False or False == False...

    False

for the next problem:

    # False and not True or True

because not True == False...

    False and False or True

because False and False == False...

    False or True

because False or True == True...

    # True and not (False or False)

We have the parentheses here

    True and not (False or False)

because False or False == False...

now we resume normal calculations. Because not False == True...

Parentheses again. Because True and True == True...

    False or not True

because not True == False...

    False or False

    print foo # returns 1

Then I spent a day trying to figure out how to copy a 2d list and that was even more frustrating.  I had the following code and none of these worked to properly copy a list without modifying the original.

    foo = [[1,4], [5,6]]

I have been using computers for 20 years and working on all kinds of areas with computers from support

1. Many people say its easy.
2. If I get okay at it I can make my own data processing tools to help myself at work.
3. If I get even better I can add stuff to support the special setup we have at work made around Maya.


Two years ago I read a chunk of A byte of Python but stopped again because I had no real project to work on. A month or two ago I started again with TheNewBoston: Python Tutorial


Where I am now is that I have made a few small programs/scripts for reading a list of numbers and using that with loops to generate some XMLish looking output files. Last one I used the PIL image to make a mosaic by reading the pixel values and finding the closest value.


I got stuck when trying to learn how to use a real XML parsing module because I couldn't easily see what data it had picked up.


So now I'm looking to buy 1-3 books that I can focus on to get more base knowledge. But i'm unsure what is best for me. I have borrowed Mark Lutz's ""Learning Python"" 3rd edition but find it a bit 'slow'. I don't need to learn how to install a program or basic computer usage. Maybe i'm just being a bit impatient so if this book is brilliant just tell me to keep at it. 


I think I could use one book for teaching me the fundamentals of Python and Programming. Not sure if I'm actually past this step since I already done a few small tools. I'm thinking about getting [Learn Python The Hard Way


I guess the next step could be the new [The Python Standard Library by Example](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Standard-Library-Example-Developers/dp/0321767349/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1339505533&amp;sr=1-1)


A third book could be more related to Autodesk Maya


I'm not that interested in books that focus mainly on building large websites. 


So far I have selected Python 2.7.x because then I have access to the PIL module (used it in my mosaic script). If you think this is a bad call please tell me so. :) I found PIL for 2.x a lot faster than I could find something similar for 3.x

I've decided to take on learning Python and try to get a real gig as a developer sometime down the road instead of my SysAdmin duties I currently have to make a living. So that said

However

I'm currently going through Dive Into Python 3 as my first introduction to Python. (I started with the Django tutorials but realized quickly I should learn python first). 

I'm currently on this section. http://diveintopython3.ep.io/iterators.html#a-plural-rule-iterator

    rules_filename = 'plural6-rules.txt'

    def __init__(self):
        self.pattern_file = open(self.rules_filename
        self.cache = []

    def __iter__(self):
        self.cache_index = 0
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        self.cache_index += 1
        if len(self.cache) &gt;= self.cache_index:
            return self.cache[self.cache_index - 1]

        if self.pattern_file.closed:
            raise StopIteration

        line = self.pattern_file.readline()
        if not line:
            self.pattern_file.close()

            pattern
        self.cache.append(funcs)
        return funcs

    rules = LazyRules()
     

In walking through this in my head
    
    self.cache = [] -- It's empty.
    self.cache_index = 0 -- It's Zero
   
    We call next(self). (We Iterate). 
    self.cache_index is now = 1
   
    if len([]) &gt;= 1: (It's not). 
   
    if self.pattern_file.closed: (Pass)
    line = self.pattern_file.readline() -- We load the pattern file
    if not line: (Pass)
   
    pattern, 3) -- Split the pattern file and grab the first data set from the line and store them as pattern, search, and replace. 
   
    funcs = build_match_and_apply_functions(

            return re.search(pattern
        def apply_rule(word):
            return re.sub(search
        return (matches_rule
   
-----------
Now..
    
            self.cache.append(funcs) -- self.cache = [(functions tuple)] len(self.cache) is now = 1
            return funcs

    rules = LazyRules()
   

--------------

Sorry for the wall of text. 

My confusion comes on the iteration process. When it iterates through again with next()
   
    len(self.cache) = [] -- It's 1
    self.cache_index = -- It's now 2 (Due to self.cache_index += 1)
   
            if len(self.cache) &gt;= self.cache_index: -- (If 1 &gt;= 2)
                return self.cache[self.cache_index - 1] (Fail
    

Here's my fundamental breakdown in understanding. The book introduces this as the walkthrough, since cache_index is always +1 from the previous iteration, and self.cache starts at 0. 

I'm also wondering where in this selection process is there a rule match that breaks the read in the pattern file. It seems to indicate that if it runs through and matches one of the cases in our function generator
-----------This is the book's description of the process---------------------
When the module is imported, which opens the pattern file but does not read from it.
(HERE IS WHERE I AM CONFUSED) --&gt;When asked for the first match and apply function, and caches them.
Let’s say, no further match and apply functions are built, and no further lines are read from the pattern file.
Furthermore, which will reset the cache index but will not reset the open file object.
The first time through, however, the cache is primed with a single pair of match and apply functions, corresponding to the patterns in the first line of the pattern file. Since they were built and cached in the course of pluralizing the previous word, they’re retrieved from the cache. The cache index increments, and the open file is never touched.
Let’s say, the cache is exhausted — it only contained one item, and we’re asking for a second — so the __next__() method continues. It reads another line from the open file, builds match and apply functions out of the patterns, and caches them. &lt;-- (HERE IS WHERE I AM CONFUSED)
This read-build-and-cache process will continue as long as the rules being read from the pattern file don’t match the word we’re trying to pluralize. If we do find a matching rule before the end of the file, waiting for the next readline() command. In the meantime, the cache now has more items in it, and if we start all over again trying to pluralize a new word, each of those items in the cache will be tried before reading the next line from the pattern file.

-----------This is the book's description of the process---------------------

Another example before getting here is a Fibonacci Class. This class took me some time to walk through, and self.b has become self.a + self.b. So I'm confident that I understand that the Class Variables are changeable in the previous example, but I don't see the long tail of how it all ties together and how it stops iterating or why it chooses to stop iterating, since the cache always being lower than the cache_index just throws me. 
   
class Fib:
    '''iterator that yields numbers in the Fibonacci sequence'''

    def __init__(self
        self.max = max

    def __iter__(self):
        self.a = 0
        self.b = 1
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        fib = self.a
        if fib &gt; self.max:
            raise StopIteration
        self.a
        return fib

You can send the bot different commands with text parameters.

I'm sure that the bot somehow manages to actually read all the text and not a set of preset images for the commands they use because it can recognise randomised passwords to be correct or incorrect.

ex: It can read /set password kc9amcb02n

and validate that password as being correct or incorrect.

I've been working on this problem for a while now and I cannot seem to find a way to approach it.

I've got two csv files : source.csv and report.csv

source.csv looks like this:

    Target
    target01
    target1234
    target2348

report.csv looks similar (it actually has more fields but I just pasted the ones I'm interested in to keep it short):

    Target
    target01
    target02
    target1234


Basically
Then I can output to another csv file : Target, Spend, Income
And go to the next target

Not all targets are in both files

Unfortunately

The print in line 9 is just used to check that the script is going over the csv file correctly.

I understand why its not working. I cannot figure out how to iterate over the targets in source.csv and iterate over the targets in report.csv.

I've been reading that this probably is much easier with a dictionary instead of using csv.reader() but I still don't know how to properly iterate over the targets.

I get my random points (x and y) between 0 and .5 by doing something like this:  randint(0

I use an array to keep track of all the averages so I can plot them using matplotlib/pylab which is kind of cool and gives a little insight into how closely things can be calculated.

So the question here is:  after 500 million points shouldn't I be able to approximate pi to the third or fourth decimal points at least?

1373938416.0,1idrff,An imported function no longer works after another import is done,ltristain,11,3,2,"Hi

So this is what I'm dealing with:

&gt; I have a module A

&gt; * submodule A.B contains a function called ""func1""
&gt; * submodule A.B.C contains a function called ""func2""

&gt; I also have a separate module B with an class C

&gt; Lastly

What I've learned so far is that

&gt; from A.B import func1

func1 will work.

However

&gt; from A.B import func1

&gt; from A.B.C import func2

func1 will not work.

After digging around and trying stuff, the fact that I have both A.B.C and B.C is confusing the global namespace and thus causing this unexpected failure, despite that within each module the code looks correct.

However

Perhaps I should be using imports differently

Any comments/help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",,t5_2r8ot,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1idrff/an_imported_function_no_longer_works_after/
1373864411.0,1ibkly,question about defining variables. (project euler #2),_dredraz_,13,5,6,"while working on problem 2 from project Euler I came across the importance of order in defining variables.  this is my code:
    
    x = 1
    y = 2
    list = [1]
    total = 0
    

    while y &lt;= 4000000:
	    list.append(y)
	    if y % 2 == 0:
	        total += y
	    x
    
    print total


My question is this:  how does this variable allocation work? It seems like it is simultaneously assigning values for x and y.  did quantum computing arrive and i missed it?

If the variables were assigned sequentially

    while y &lt;= 4000000:
	    list.append(y)
	    if y % 2 == 0:
		    total += y
        y = x+y
        x = y

y being defined first would change the value of x in a way that is undesired.  so i found out that this works
    
    x

but how is python doing this?  any insight to push along my comprehension here would be greatly appreciated

I just wanted to get another basic perspective on how code would look like.

Here is the scenario:

Let's say I have 4 variables
Variable A

I will be inputting a sequence of these variables (say 10.... AABADDABDD).

How would I code so that it calculates the percentage of B and D within that sequence.

I was thinking along the lines of assigning a def f(x) that has 4 variables

I have only done 2 weeks of the course but I want to know if my thinking here is correct? Something tells me def f(x) won't work because there are too many variables.

Unfortunately, I typically need to run this program several hundreds of times over and over again, so I decided to write a Python script to do this for me. I've been experimenting with this script again and wanted to parallelize all operations using the *MultiProcessing* library. 



The multiprocessing script I wrote will run on my local machine; however

    Pool1.map(myworker


re-runs all the code in 

    if __name__ == ""__main__"":  
    

Hence the program gets trapped in recursion where every time I call Pool1.map

I don't know if I've made some poor programming error

    import subprocess

        if n &lt; 0: 
            n = str(n)
        return n
So, so I could try something like this:

    values = []
    a = raw_input(""A value:"")
    b = raw_input(""B value:"")
    c = raw_input(""C value:"")

    values.append(b)
    values.append(c)
(Side question: Is there a better way to put the two values in a list

    for value in values:
        with_sign(value)
Ok

Eventually
    
    print ""You have to perform the operation:"", a+b+c,"".""

So if a = 2, I want the output to be 

""You have to preform the operation: 2-5-23 to get -26.""

and if a=-4

I've tried google but a lot of the solutions point you toward a special mod. I eventually got down a track that talked about ""parsing strings"" but I got confused and eventually gave up.
