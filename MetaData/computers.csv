2005:  My company purchases a Dell laptop computer for me with Windows XP.  Nothing fancy

Fast forward to 2012...

Apple no longer makes their own processor and has used only Intel processors for several years.  Due to the differences in architecture, I had always used Mozilla Firefox.  Well guess what, they stopped supporting the mac platforms.  Started using a 4th party browser, which is now no longer supported.  So... no big deal, we'll just use my work computer for those things.  Then...

The new iPhone is released, which is now frozen at Leopard.  So we can't update (Apple) iTunes, and can't revive the bricked (Apple) iPod with a (Apple) computer.  So....

Fire up the 7 year old Dell notebook with an operating system first released in 2001, then easily recover the iPod functionality.  After copying some library files from the Mac to the Dell, everything is back in working order on the iPod.

So now we'll have to use the Microsoft-powered Dell for anything online that uses Flash, like the great and powerful Oz wasting away behind the curtain with his superpowers exposed as simply smoke and hype.",,False,self,t5_2qhm5,False,,

I purchased a laptop in 2008 that has since had its motherboard replaced twice, RAM replaced, keyboard replaced, casing replaced, and audio inputs replaced. My laptop model has a class action lawsuit against it, but HP flatly refuses to replace it.

In my most recent request to get my laptop fixed for the 7th time since purchase

Tech support escalated claim to a case manager

A week passes. Rod ignores update phone calls and emails. I finally get a straight-to-voicemail message from him stating that corporate will fix my computer if I pay half. According to him, that could not be fixed.

I call back multiple times and am unable to reach Rod. I talk to 2 different case managers and ask for their assistance. One hangs up on me after a long discussion about his inability to do anything.

The other claims my warranty already expired a year ago. Strange

I hang up and initiate a new claim with tech support for the same issue. A repair ticket is filed and the repair box is sent for free as per my warranty terms. My computer is fixed...again.

How can I get such disparate service claims from the case managers? Yet I'm able to skip past the managerial level and get the service they claimed I'd have to pay for

HP has not extended my warranty and will not even let me pay for an extended warranty

This laptop and the customer service from HP has been the worst I've ever experienced. I go through a similar battle every 6 months. As per my promise to the staff I talked to

UPDATE
Just got a call back from Rod

He further explains that he cannot offer any money

When Rod returns from being on hold

I contact text chat support and request the service notes Rod won't give me. The service ticket no longer exists in their system.

Aseiya: Hi
you: jim
Aseiya: Hello Jim.  
Aseiya: How may I help you with your purchase today?
you: I have a question about the new adobe suite
Aseiya: Sure
you: I am a freelance designer and I was noticing that Adobe CC requires a monthly fee
Aseiya: No going forward all adobe software will be available in subscription form.
you: so, now I graduated, does this mean if I want to ever upgrade my suite I will not be able to own my own copy? and if so, why has adobe went this route
Aseiya: Before we proceed
Aseiya: No
you: well, I edit videos, and composite them using after effects, and do dabble in adobe audition for audio mixing
Aseiya: You'll not lose your CS6 version.
you: yes I know but will they continue to give cs6 updates and features or will I have to subscribe and not own a newer version
Aseiya: If you subscribe to CC version you'll get the future upgrades for free.      
you: yes but I wont get to ever keep it
you: I only upgrade every 2 years usually
you: is there no way to buy out right the newer versions I am saying
Aseiya: I understand your concern
Aseiya: Since you own CS6 you'll get a special price on CC membership.  
you: thank you I just wanted to make sure adobe was indeed no longer letting us costumers own something we pay for

I ordered 6 of these. One dies after completely loading the system while migrating docs on an emergency Sunday laptop repair for my boss's boss, I'm guessing damage control is cheaper than catching the bad ones.

That's not my big beef though. I tried twice to submit an inoffensive, anonymous, glowing reviews appeared instead. This stinks to high heaven. I complained to the retailer, got a generic response on posting policy so I replied with a completely acceptable review I planned to post and expected to see on the site within 24 hours, or receive a reply explaining precisely how it was against review policy. 24 hours later and it's not there. In my opinion this seems to be stacking the deck on product reviews.

They've lost my business forever.

Here are some of the things he suggested. What do you guys think? Do these actually work? Has anyone tried them out? I googled some of the items and it sounded people were 50/50 about tweaking these settings.

•Always back up the system or verify the restore point
•Restart the computer whenever prompted (this will determine if the computer can handle the change)
•For restore menu

**Msconfig**
type Msconfig.exe  on Command prompt
	Edit the startup
	Remove all the programs that start up with the computer that are not needed for the PC’s task

UAC settings = set it to none
Why? Windows adds an unnecessary step when approving something and it’s annoying when working on the pc.

**Services**
Got to services.exe 
Remove Windows live ID, and other programs that are not needed. 
This task will depend PC to PC. 
Why? Because there are programs running on the background that are not needed

**Advance System Settings**
	Visual Effects
		Set to adjust for best performance
			But keep
Why? No need for fancy process grabbing effects
	Advanced  
Set for programs, uncheck “Automatically manage paging “and use the recommended size 
 
**Increase core parking (mostly for laptops) could be dangerous
Why? This is great if the PC has a constant heavy load from a demanding program. 

In Command prompt 
powercfg -attributes SUB_PROCESSOR 0cc5b647-c1df-4637-891a-dec35c318583 -ATTRIB_HIDE powercfg -attributes SUB_PROCESSOR ea062031-0e34-4ff1-9b6d-eb1059334028 -ATTRIB_HIDE

Go to power settings 
Set Processor power to 100%

**Do not check Drivers **
	Some versions of Windows run the driver versifier at random to check your drivers. This is good if it uncovers problems
To turn it off

**How to Configure and Use IntFiltr. Google for download**
Why ? Binding of device interrupts to particular processors on multiprocessor computers is a useful technique to maximize performance
1.	Run IntFiltr.exe located in the Config folder of this package.
2.	Under Devices, respectively. When IntFiltr is installed on a device, the string ""InterruptAffinityFilter"" appears in the Upper Filters box.
3.	Select the Set Mask option to set the CPU affinity for the selected device interrupt

NOTE: Installing IntFiltr on a device has no useful effect if no CPU affinity mask exists for a device.

**Change system priorities using software “Prio”**
Why? ""Windows"" shares the processor time between all running processes based upon their priority.  If a process has higher priority
	http://www.askvg.com/how-to-permanently-set-process-priority-in-windows-task-manager/
Do not set the priority to “Real Time’ if the program was not designed to run in real time. Most programs are not able to run in real time unless they were designed to run in real time.

**Create a batch file to refresh explorer.exe**
Why?   It’s a way to troubleshoot Computer Errors
Open an notepad.exe
Enter this code 
@echo off
 taskkill /f /IM explorer.exe
 explorer.exe
Save it as a .bat file 
Place it on the desktop and tell user to double click it if computer slows down
Works for TABLETS!!!! 


**Event Viewer.exe**
	Search for event viewer on windows. 
	This is a build in program in windows that shows you all the failures the system experienced. 
	It is a detailed list; it will show the process that failed and the time. 
	Why? Makes it is easy to trouble shoot errors.

1367541538.0,1dl768,It Seems Like I Am the Only One Here Who Thinks Windows 8 Is Pretty Damn Good. Allow Me to Explain Why.,LePetomane,25,16,14,"OK, which I previously had installed on my Bootcamp partition

I downloaded Windows 8 Pro and burnt it to a DVD so I could do a clean, I had to install the Apple Bootcamp software to get all the Apple drivers. Nothing too major here.

In the beginning, etc. And, no ""Start"" menu! WTF? Well, as I familiarized myself with 8, I soon realized that the Start menu didn't go anywhere - it just got bigger! Windows 8 is basically Windows 7 with ""Metro"" (Start menu) added to it, along with a few new performance tweaks and features. 

Fast forward through 6 months of familiarization, and I thought I would never catch myself saying something like that. 

Windows 8 feels like it uses my computer's resources more efficiently. For example, when I command MS Word 2011 to open, I get to watch the ""W"" icon bounce up and down in the dock several times before a blank document appears. Time enough to grab a beer from the refrigerator. In Windows 7, it took about the same amount of time. When booting into Windows 8, it boots up remarkably fast - about 10-seconds to the login screen. Windows 7 and OSX both take far longer to boot.

There are many other things I like about Windows 8, metro, yada yada, but my guess is they aren't being patient and giving it a fair chance.

To summarize what I've said, Windows 8 blows OSX ""Lion"" out of the water as far as responsiveness and boot time are concerned. All of my programs load very quickly in 8, and run very stable and responsively with no hiccups or snafus. Windows 8 for the desktop is basically Windows 7, with some added features geared toward tablets. In addition, functional under-the-hood improvements are apparent in 8, which I feel make more efficient use of computer resources to make it as responsive as it is. 

I'm neither an Apple or Microsoft fanboy. I recognize the fact that both products have their place, and I appreciate both. That said, and as a layman, I say well done to Microsoft with regard to Windows 8. It breathes refreshing new life into my old Core2 Duo computer box. Thanks for reading, and happy computing.

I have tech-related goals on 2 fronts; my research group and teaching in the classroom.

For my research group

I will have ~4 desktop PCs for multipurpose use by the students in the research group. I also plan to have a nice laser printer that I hope any of these computers can print from. I want to have a backup/digital storage location (probably 1 or 2 large capacity USB hard drives) that can be accessed by all computers and maybe even doing some automatic backup of all the group’s files. Also

On the teaching front

So… I am open to ANY suggestions

Cheers

You can order it now and it was proposed to be the first Steambox styled PC available.

It costs around 1000$ and the hardware is freaking weaksause for that price.

It's supposed to be a compact prebuilt ""gaming"" system, they decided to go the ultra low power route with an APU integrated GPU, instead of a discrete GPU.

For the same price you could, even from the more pricy brands, that are much more powerful, for less then that.


I am confused now

If the later


Is this why Valve suddenly fired a bunch of their hardware guys? Because they knew that Xi3 would come out with an overpriced POS like this?



EDIT: For the donkeys that keep repeating this has nothing to do with Valve and this was never supposed to be THE steambox

Hi Adam

 

Now is not a good time to be buying hard disk drives. There is a shortage due to flooding in Thailand.

 

Some time ago, prices of hard disk drives have gone up by around 150%

 

The price to supply and install a 1000GB hard disk drive now

 

 


Regards Chris.

I emailed him earlier this year about getting an upgrade but then decided not to get it due to the price, games etc.

Has the flooding in Thailand really increased hardrive prices? And does anyone know of any cheaper alternatives

I'm here to ask you: given your current needs and wants

As an example and my own case

My needs are simply browsing the web, and doing some penetrating testing. The computer I currently have is definitely suiting me perfectly in terms of power, but my gaming zeal is going down, and I'm sure once I get bored of BFBC2 (not for awhile unfortunately), my computer power needs will drop like a rock, leaving GRID as my sole ""intensive"" application (I dont think I'll ever get bored of it... I love it so.) 

To go down the list;
AMD A8 3520M - Has two extra cores I rarely ever utilize unless I'm playing BFBC2.
6620G IGP - Suits me perfectly
640 GB 5400 RPM Toshiba HDD - I only use 140 GB of it... That number is slowly dropping as I remove games slowly and get bored of them. Maybe going from 5400 to 7200 or even SSD may be more comfy for me however.
Slim ODD - I hardly ever use this thing... I only use it to dualboot Backtrack 5... Which can be run off USB...

This will be a growing collection of tips

These are the fixes I applied:

**Reduce the fat window borders:**

* start regedit
* set in [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\WindowMetrics]:
* ""CaptionWidth""=""-255""
* ""CaptionHeight""=""-255""
* ""PaddedBorderWidth""=""0""

**Disable all animations:**

* go to the control panel
* click ""Ease of Access Center""
* ignore / disable the voice
* click ""Make the Computer easier to use""
* check ""Turn off all unnecessary animations""

**Disable the ""drag-away"" Lock-Screen**

* run gpedit.msc
* go to Computer Configuration -&gt; Administrative Templates -&gt; All Settings
* Double click ""Do not display the lock screen"" and activate it

**Create your own quick-launch menu**

* I quite liked the old quick-launch menu
* right click the task bar
* choose a folder
* disable ""fix taskbar""
* right-click it
* resize to your liking

**Make the ~~Metro~~-Screen usable**

* This may be obvious
* Many Programs install a lot of links to the Start screen. Remove all except the main program shortcut
* The other shortcuts are not lost. You can still reach the equivalent of the old start menu via right click in the Start screen and choosing ""All Apps"" in the lower right corner.

**Get the important desktop links**

* Again something quite simple
* right click your desktop
* choose ""Personalize""
* on the left
* Activate the ones you need

**Use the Mini-Start Menu**

* While in Desktop
* Right-Click
* enjoy :)

Other than that.. just avoid ~~Metro~~. It might be nice on a tablet

**(I didn't get much of a response from /r/suggestalaptop so I'm x-posting here

So as the title of this post says I can't make up my mind concerning the new Razer laptops.
Before I get into this, so I was looking for a laptop that could complement that while I'm gone, and I found the Razer Blade and the Pro.

Price is not really an issue since I know I'm making an investment that will be worth 3-4 years.
The major issue that I'm facing is the screen size and quality.

The Pro weighs in at about 6.5 pounds (not so awesome) and sports a 17 inch screen with 1920x1080 resolution - very awesome. Will a 17 inch laptop be too large?

To me this SHOULD be where the regular Blade comes in -- 14 inches 4.5 pounds

I've had a Macbook Pro (13 inch) since June 2008
Now, will that let me keep the 1080p resolution or will it just revert to 1650x900 ? I apologize for the noob question).

Blade Pro owners- just how portable is it? Does it feel clunky/ heavy?

Regular Blade owners- do you wish you had more screen space and higher res?

[here's](http://www.toshiba.ca/web/product.grp?lg=en&amp;section=1&amp;group=223&amp;product=5611&amp;part=6098#spectop) some specifications about my laptop from Toshiba Canada's website.

My main problems with my Satellite A100:

--battery has basically been useless for the last 3 years at least (only lasts for about 20 min unplugged

--battery is pretty hard to find online

--hard drive space is pretty small for the amount of space I need for school work, but it requires manual back up and I'm paranoid of missing something important and then losing it somehow)

--it's heavy. According to the link I have earlier in this post

-- even though I'm Canadian

the rest of the problems are pretty trivial and easy to deal with

The reason I haven't given up on my computer yet is because I'm typically of the belief that I should use something until I absolutely can't use it any more. I'm amazed this computer has lasted as long as it has. I used to have a really old laptop before this

*I only guess 2007 because that's the earliest year I can find as the save date of any program or document on my computer. It's older than that though - I found some programs installed by the previous owner that neither I nor my Mom would've installed on it that dated to 2006 IIRC.

**TL;DR** I've managed to use my computer for ~5 or 6 years

I placed the RMA request with Zotac requesting an advanced replacement of the GPU so I wouldn't be without a computer for a week or so. The next day I got an auto generated response with instructions to send the card back to them (At my expense) for them to receive and then send me out a replacement.

Assuming this was just the system working on it's own and that they hadn't noticed my request I called today and spoke with a customer service rep. I asked him if they would offer me an advanced replacement and was rudely told no. I then asked if they would at least provide me a shipping label to return the card to them. At this point he started talking to someone else about my request and then came back and told me no again rudely. I then asked if I could speak with his manager because I haven't dealt with a company that hasn't provided AT LEAST a shipping label to return defective products. He then goes back to talking to someone else for a moment and comes back claiming his manager was 'busy' and could not talk. I said thank you and ended the call after this.

Several hours later I call back and speak to someone else named Brian. He isn't as rude

At this point I have made up my mind that I will not be buying nor suggesting Zotact products to anyone else if this is how they treat their customers. I have handled RMAs with several big electronics companies like ASUS, Kingston, HP, Lenovo, and I'm sure more. Not ONCE have I ever been treated rudely or been asked to cover the cost of returning a defective product. I don't think I'm off base in saying that this if very poor customer service and not how a company should treat it's patrons.

256GB RAID 1 (256GB Solid State Drive SATA + 256GB mSATA) 



For those who are interested... this is my laptop configuration. Please let me know where I should upgrade or downgrade.



PROCESSOR	3rd Generation Intel® Core™ i7-3630QM (6MB Cache

OPERATING SYSTEM	Windows® 7 Home Premium

MEMORY	12GB (1 X 4GB

HARD DRIVE	512GB RAID 0 (256GB Solid State Drive SATA + 256GB mSATA)	

VIDEO CARD	1 GB GDDR5 NVIDIA® GeForce® GT 650M with Optimus™	

LCD PANEL	14.0"" High Def (720p/1366x768) with WLED backlight	

WIRELESS CARDS	Killer Wireless-N 1202 a/g/n 2x2 MIMO for Gaming &amp; Video and Bluetooth 4.0	


UPDATE: Thank you all for taking the time to give me excellent answers. I ended up buying the 256GB SSD SATA 6Gb/s hardrive and downgrading to 8gb of memory. The computer was so expensive so I couldn't afford to increase the video card or lcd panel. I think this will be a great gaming computer. If you want







The Result: 


The Good: Gaming is great on this computer. There is no lag


The Bad: The screen looked washed out and I compared it with my MAC that has rich colors

Okay so I felt that and Ivy bridge i5 is a better value than the i7 for the value so id like some opinions on that. 

Both the i5 and i7 Ivy bridge have the same socket 1155 so I was wondering which chipset would be best for the things I want to put in that so I will list those throughout the post and give me an opinion on the end
so now that I have said which processor I want I was wondering about my graphics card(s)

I was wondering if I should get 2 gtx 560 ti 2GB or 1 gtx 660 ti 2GB
and to further that which nvidia manufacturer is the best because Ive heard asus makes good parts and that evga is good for nvidia and for that I will need to make sure that i have a PCI exp 16 3.0 for the 660 or 2 2.0s for the 560s

If there are more things i should consider please tell me

for memory I have no idea about manufacturers and quality 
I just want fast memory thats going to probably be 240 pin ddr3 (seeming from the motherboards i am looking at) so can someone explain to me what the numbers on the memory mean. 
for example the 1600 in DDR3 1600. Is that the speed in Megahertz?
I want 16GB of it so I had some questions about whether to get 2 modules of 4 or 2 of 8 and what on a motherboard indicates which is the preferred method.
Which brands are best also?

So now when it comes to storage I want an SSD to be my primary boot drive so i am thinking 256gb. can someone explain how to pick and SSD and what things there are to consider when doing so.

for mass storage ill probably want 2TB of HDD so i dont think that is very difficult cause ill either go  for a 7200rpm or 10000rpm with alot of cache memory.

when it comes to power supplies

some other things that i have going into this are obviously the wireless card which i think ill just take from my current desktop PCI express x1

i also have a capture card which is also pci express x1

i was thinking about a sound card but idk if that is necessary so can I get an opinion on that.

obviously this thing will probably have usb 3.0 because the ivy bridge supporting motherboards have it

I was thinking full tower case because the air circulation will be important and I probably dont need any liquid cooling because i dont plan on overclocking b/c 3.4 GHz is pretty good.
so I think that covers it

If anyone has a suggestion on a full tower case please send me a link

I commute by bicycle and I have to carry a laptop for work. It is an Apple 17in pro. I currently carry it in a backpack instead of on a pannier on the back of the bike because in my brain, my body absorbs more of the shock. Whereas if I put it in a bag/pannier on a rear rack, that would pick up every road bump and vibration. 

I am typing this because I am tired of the backpack. I want to put the laptop in the pannier but I am afraid of damaging it. I realize even if the pannier is fine I could fall and it could get damaged as a result. But I am looking for an expert opinion on if the bouncing caused by being attached to the back if the bike would be something I should worry about for the long term health of the laptop?

Skipping the startup repair leads to a quick blue screen of death image before it just dies. At one point it got all the way to disk check

Fast forward three days: I work at a university and I've had our department IT look at it, Disk-Block 1536 FAIL, interrupt request did not set in time"". Google tells me that can indicate a hard drive disk failure (or that the hdd is dying). At one point, we also saw the code 2000-0146, which again I think is something to do with a failing hdd. I've taken the computer apart and there doesn't appear to be any loose cables or anything, and I reseated the hdd. No luck. We took the hdd out and tried to mount it externally to another computer, but it can only find the recovery drive (which apparently has nothing on it?). I have pictures and music from the last year since I backed up that I would really like to save from the hdd if possible. 

So, and when I turn the computer on, all I see is one line of some weird ass characters. I'd like to try to install an OS before buying a new hdd so that if there are worse problems, I don't waste money. But the ""new"" hdd doesn't see the Windows 7 disc we gave it. He also said something about trying to run diagnostics with the ""new"" hdd, but that the computer just shuts off in the middle.

Now I'm at a loss. Our IT guy is busy and this is unimportant to him, but I thought maybe Reddit could help. I'll answer any questions that you've got to help you narrow down the problem. Please help!!!!

Hello

This morning my Acer Aspire 5251-1513 was working just fine but I left it unplugged and it went into sleep mode after I left it unattended for about 15 minutes (I have done this hundreds on times with no issues) but today when I went to start it up (while plugged into the power supply)

The computer starts up and the fan spins but the HDD/WIFI lights no longer come on and neither does the screen

I connected the vga output to another monitor and all I got was a blank screen

----------------------------------------------------

I already tried this method

&gt;Remove the battery and charger/ac adapter/power cord from your Acer 5251-1513 laptop

I also tried to take out the battery and power supply and hold the power button for 60 seconds.

Both did not work.

The power supply/cord is working just fine and so is the battery so I doubt that those are the problems.

I have already searched the web and I found this link...
