The plugin won two awards and its source code has undergone security audit that found no malicious code.  Does no good deed go unpunished?

The users of FGS have already started an online petition to force Facebook to revert their ban.  You can sign the petition here:

This is false.

This has been in the news in Europe earlier

The truth is that people have been posting to other people's WALLS

Also, couldn't find a source.

I though googled another link [claiming the exact same reason](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=458458): those are the wall posts

Edit: Also Jussi Pullinen

Edit2: Here's a Google translate explanation [what really happened](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fkari.haakana%2Fposts%2F10150542110657189), so (slightly edited to make it more-English) copy-paste of the post is here:

""One of the FB-mails affected by a bug is found. It's harmless, the parties should collect the evidence.

My case went like this:

1. Yesterday, I went on to examine their timeline. Nothing obvious was not found, but a few post aroused my suspicions.

2. I went to the inbox and I did search the senders name. In three cases, but there is no longer found in the 2007 messages.

3. I came here to tell the wall Håkan business. Were tested: Kari saw also taking control of the message, which are visible only to the sender and the recipient, but not the other, it was wrong, b) some of INBOX and timeline of the border leak / leakage, but we do not know, either way

This discussion thread probably moved to Finland last night of the debate on the direction

4. FB's representative asked Jussi Pullinen through contact, to a bug in the leaked through my inbox, not the other way around**. I do not have any reason to doubt this explanation.

I hear the horror stories still very secret messages that people were found from their walls, they are delivered to FB for review.""

1332881370.0,rgej4,How to see who you interact with most,,24,3,26,"A little trick to find out the people you interact with most is as follows (I want to put a disclaimer here that this is based on conjecture seeing some files and knowing the people I interact with most on facebook.)

Interactions are profile views, likes etc.

Things you will need:

* chrome or firefox with firebug installed on a computer you use regularly. A clean cache

* A facebook profile

To see who facebook thinks you interact with most and who they thing you are searching for you need to do the following

* Sign in to facebook

* Right click on the facebook page

* Switch to the network tab (it's at the top of the inspect element partition) then switch to the XHR tab (this is along the bottom now)

* Hit f5 to refresh the whole page. (if this doesn't work clearing the cache then hitting f5 works, or hitting enter in the url are ways I've seen bootstrap.php appear)

* Some files will start appearing in the partition now we are looking for bootstrap.php (usually the second one that shows up) or first_degree.php

* Click on bottstrap.php and open up the payload (bootstrap.php can contain groups/pages/etc so keep looking until you find one that has friends in it)

* The top entries show you who you interact with the most the more negative a number the more you interact with them.

This will show you everyone who you have interacted with recently (I do not know how long a time period recently is) there is more weight given to people who you don't know/people you have recently added.
Here is where it gets interesting I think this is a two way system
So reddit who are your top people you interact with? And how many people have been stalking your facebook?

Even if 90% of that is a lie. Well maybe lie is too strong of a word. How about white lies, right?  I hope. Here are 7 things that people lie about most on Facebook.
 
**Going Offline**

[Example](http://cdn.smosh.com/sites/default/files/bloguploads/fbbig-lies-10.jpg)

'GTG! My mom's calling me to dinner!' or any variation of this excuse is a big fat lie. These people are not going offline. They just don't wanna chat anymore. They wanna play games or look at sexy pictures without being interrupted by your attempt at LOLs.  If you're gonna go 'offline'
 
**Most Things They Say In Their 'About Me' Section**

[Example](http://cdn.smosh.com/sites/default/files/bloguploads/fbbig-lies-9.jpg)

Highlight the one cool job you ever had. Fail to mention you are currently a burrito slinger. Say you went to a prestigious university
 
**Their Age**

[Example](http://cdn.smosh.com/sites/default/files/bloguploads/fbbig-lies-3.jpg)

My 14 year old cousin and all her friends love to say they're 16. I love to inform their mothers of this. I feel bad, that they met on Facebook because he was trolling for 16 year olds. Back in my day we had to meet creepers the old-fashioned way, in the 7/11 parking lot. Luckily, I knew to never accept free Slurpees from strangers.
 
**Their Profile Pic**

[Example](http://cdn.smosh.com/sites/default/files/bloguploads/fbbig-lies-4.jpg)

It's one thing to put your most flattering photo up
 
**Surprise At Receiving So Many Birthday Wishes**

[Example](http://cdn.smosh.com/sites/default/files/bloguploads/fbbig-lies-5.jpg)

Are we really all that surprised anymore that on our birthday we get a ton of birthday wishes? I'm usually surprised when I don't get a ton. I'm not the only one who sits there all day refreshing my page and making mental notes of those you didn't get wishes from
 
**Responses To Invites**

[Example](http://cdn.smosh.com/sites/default/files/bloguploads/fbbig-lies-6.png)

There's only so many crappy band gigs and cringe-inducing improv shows one can go to! For me that number is zero. But I always put maybe and then change it to 'no'
 
**Their Interests And 'Likes'**

[Example](http://cdn.smosh.com/sites/default/files/bloguploads/fbbig-lies-8.jpg)

These sections are LIE central! Just because you took hundreds of blurry pics of your shoes doesn't make you interested in abstract art. And you can't 'like' Bob Dylan when you only know the Miley Cyrus cover of ""You're Gonna Make Me Lonsesome When You Go' .  I know you're trying to look 'mature' but he kind of looks weird sitting in between Justin Bieber and Lil Wayne.

* One of my friends has cleaned up her rooms and now doesn't feel very well.
* Another friend posts a joke that we've seen a million times before.
* Another friend says how much he enjoyed watching Britains Got Talent. Ie (I've been sat in front of the TV all night)
* Another friend is totally fed up.
* Another friend says ""this book is amazing"" and doesn't reveal which one she has been sat reading.

Now is it just me? Or is that just all so bloody boring!?  Thats all scattered inbetween endless shite of ""which celebrity do i look like?"" 

Its all just all shite!  I am wasting my time reading utter shite and nonsense.

This can come in handy if someone direct links you to a photo and you want to see the person's profile etc. Say Jimmy links Bobby some chick in a bikini with a direct link but when Bobby asks Jimmy for a link to her profile Jimmy is a prick and provides no link.

All you have to do is find the third last number in the link:


fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/xxxxxxx-xx-xxxx/XXXXxXXX/xxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxx_**1234567890**_xxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxx?_n.jpg


then copy-paste that onto the end of this:

&gt;Hello to all of you who are on my list of contacts of Facebook. I would like to ask a favor of you…. You may not know that Facebook has changed its privacy configuration once again. Thanks to the new “Graphic app”, I am going to keep this message posted and I ask you to do the following and comment “DONE”. Those of my friends who do not maintain my information in private will be eliminated from my list of friends, because I want the information I share with you, my friends, to remain among my friends and not be available to the whole world. I want to be able to publish photos of my friends and family without strangers being able to see them which is what happens now when you choose “like” or “comment”.
Unfortunately we cannot change this configuration because Facebook has made it like this. So, again without clicking and then on “Settings”. Uncheck “Life Events” and “Comments and Like”. This way my activity with my family and friends will no longer be made public. Now, copy and paste this text on your own wall (do not “share” it!). Once I see it published on your page, I will uncheck the same for you. Thanks so much!

Admin permissions allows you to designate different permission levels to other admins on your Page. There are five different permission levels: Manager, advertiser, and insights analyst. Note that at default, all admins will have the highest permission level of Manager. Please take the time to decide the permission levels for the admins on your Page. You can view and change permission levels under Edit Page &gt; Manage Admins. You can find more information here: https://www.facebook.com/help/?page=394501407235259.

Page post scheduling allows you to schedule your Page posts up to 6 months in advance

Also you may have seen that we now give people the ability to promote their post directly from the post rather than just going through the ads manager. You can learn more about promoted posts here: https://www.facebook.com/help/promote

I have nothing to prove any of this - the post disappeared without a trace.
If this is just a glitch
Though I'm usually very skeptical
If my post was intentionally deleted by facebook, it would seem to be highly ironic, since the issue at hand is the incursion of the NSA into our private information, and one of the fears associated with Prism is that it constitutes (or foreshadows) a Orwellian thought-police scenario--which is exactly what would seem to be implied if my facebook post were really censored.

But I don't want to lose the information/memories on the original account, what's the best way to go about doing this?",name_taken_,10,3, thats fine. Its good to check up on your children. They noticed I liked a page that relates to my ethnicity, what ever. I start unliking things that seem even remotely incriminating. Fast forward about a year

Now the other day shit hit the fan and I decided I can't take it anymore; as a joke ""I'm engaged"" on facebook. Everyone does it right? its funny, and ""engaged"" does because its more serious but since its online its just pretty cute. Anyway, my parents noticed this (my wall is blocked from family, but my gf's wall isn't) and started yelling at me. I calmly told them it was a joke but then they just blew up on me. Demanding to know where I would get the money to support her, let alone a family, you're not even done with school and you're planning on getting married, you're stupid to be engaged without even a job, etc, they're still upset that it still says ""engaged"" (the GF's page still says engaged since she hasn't logged on yet) and repeat what they said and berate me for about another 25 minutes pointing at their computer screen yelling about how it says that my GF just got engaged and earlier that it probably had my name on it.

so yeah, you add one, then they all get jealous, then you add more. They start drama, online of all places, then bring it to actual get togethers, then get confused and butthurt when people delete or block them.

Anyway, its my main source of contact between friends (especially those without a cellphone or can't text), I use it to find about upcoming events, and every once in a while I'll catch up with old friends I haven't heard from in a while. To put it shortly, I use this social tool as a social tool. I honestly don't want to start a new account (unless its for family) because of all the memories kept on it. Facebook is literally a time capsule since freshman year of college. I was looking through it the other day and it was full of all these memories since the beginning of college,..and spam from relatives that think tagging people in their ""funny and cool"" photos makes them hip.

I've had an alt account, but I'm hoping through some stretch of luck someone can help me out with this. I really don't want to start a fresh account because honestly, looking back from just a few years ago I've changed a lot and so much is on my original account. I can't delete my relatives and re-add them because well, I'm sure they'll notice if they do and they'll assume and gossip.

**TL;DR** I typed up the previous paragraphs while not in a clear state of mind, but I'm cautious that people I know may see this.

**Still TL;DR** I miss when you needed a college email to make a facebook account.",,t5_2qh8o,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/12lwca/need_to_make_an_alt_account_because_of_family/

A week ago I was given notice from Facebook that a post, REAL advice"", somehow violates Facebook community standards.  I later wrote on that page in the middle of that conversation ""apparently it somehow violates community standards when I say 'No, Frank, REAL advice""  

Funny thing is

-I am an admin assistant and often get chosen to handle big stuff.  out of 11 thousand people

-the kid once publicly said ""WHY IS Ginger_Shepherd and *insertothernamehere* in charge of getting better merch released?!"" before having a mini-bitch fest about taking matters into his own hands wanting to start his own ""mini-project/mission"" thing with the other members

that day I told him ""I didn't appreciate what you said in public

He bitched out even more.  swearing and yelling privately.  never apologized.  weeks pass and he's sucking up like nothing happened.  

the rest of the admin and I

sounds to me like he provided added details in the report saying something to the effect of me being a cold, condescending, meanie or whatever.

As far as I can tell I can't ""promote"" individual posts ie increase its likelihood of showing up on my followers newsfeed.    Also it does not appear that I can Tag the page in photos.    I would be able to do these things with a personal page.   For my business what's the advantage to using a page instead of a personal page ?    I have used to Facebook ads to promote my print page.  While I gained  followers looking at their stats some of them are clearly bots.   In fact as I tripled my numbers of followers my reach and interaction with potential customers didn't increase at all.
