Take one meter. Divide it into 10 equal parts. Each part is 10 centimeters long. Make a cube using that for the edges. Fill that with water near the sea level and you get a volume of 1 liter of water. Which happens to have a mass of 1 kilogram. Push that to an acceleration of 1 meter per second per second

Now say the same thing using Imperial units. Which one is simpler?

I explained in the comments of some of those threads why that's not feasible or worthwhile.

Instead

There are many advantages to 24 hour time

* Resolving the ambiguity of times without explicitly stating am/pm.
* Resolving the confusing meanings of 12am and 12pm.
* Easier calculation of time with simple addition and subtraction.
* Easier calculation of time zones for international communication.

Parts of Europe use 24 hour time almost exclusively.  e.g. Shop opening hours no Norway are stated as, meaning it's open week days from 07:00 to 23:00.  This is far less confusing than stating it's open 7 to 11, as you need to clarify whether that's am/pm.

Here are my main goals:  

* Give examples of common objects that explain or show common metric units (DONE)
* ~~Give conversions between metric and imperial units (NOT DONE
* Give conversions between metric units (DONE)

Without further ado

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Writing Symbols and Names

The SI system has been designed to ensure that every unit has a unique and unambiguous name and associated symbol

## Prefixes

The common prefixes are:

Symbol|Name|Example|Notes
:--|:--|:--|:--
M|mega|megalitre (ML)
k|kilo|kilometre (km), not uppercase 'K'
c|centi|centimetre (cm)|
m|milli|millimetre (mm)

## Unit Symbols

The symbols for all units not based on a person's name are lowercase (m for metre, Hz for hertz).  The exception to this rule is for litre.  Both uppercase L and lowercase l are permitted as the symbol for litre, but lowercase l is discouraged because it looks too much like a 1.

The symbol for degree Celsius is '°C'.  The symbol 'C' technically means coloumbs (a unit of electrical charge) though it's common for people to omit the '°' symbol anyway.

## Names

The names of units are always written *starting* with a lowercase letter

e.g. ""kilometre""

^(Intro by /u/lachlanhunt)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Distance

1 meter is the basic metric unit of distance.  It's about as tall as a chair. 

1 meter can be divided as follows:

* 100 centimeters (common in everyday use)

* 1000 millimeters (common in science) 

A centimeter is about as thick as your friend's smart phone. 

A millimeter is pretty tiny.  It's about the thickness of an american dime. 

A meter can be multiplied to make a kilometer:

* A kilometer is 1000 meters.

A kilometer is pretty far.  It's about a 12 minute walk

Some other common things that it's important to know the size of:
An average human is less than 2 meters tall.  2 meters is a really tall man

You car is probably about 4 to 5 meters long.  Your house is anywhere from 10 to 20 meters on a side

The United States is about 5, from the tip of the aleutian islands to the end of the panhandle. 

The distance from the equator to the north pole is defined as exactly 10,000 kilometers.  The earth's diameter is about 12,000 km, and we orbit the sun at a distance of around 150 million km.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Speed

Speed is directly proportional to distance

* Kilometers per hour (km/h)

* Meters per second (m/s)

A single kilometer per hour is painfully slow.  A standard walking pace is between 4 and 5 kilometers per hour - you'd have to be walking in circles, here are some common speed limits:

Small Towns: 40 km/h (pretty slow)

Back Roads: 70 km/h (pretty quick

Highway: 100 km/h - 110 km/h (keep in mind this is the speed limit

Racecars: Nearly 300 km/h

Commercial Airplanes

One meter per second is faster, due to the lack of unit conversion when everything else is measured in meters and seconds. 

A car on the highway is travelling about 30 m/s

Sound travels at 340 m/s through air at sea level

The thunderstorm trick in metric:  Light travels so fast we can assume it reaches your eyes instantaneously

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Mass

This is a tricky unit, which is how much stuff is in an object, and will not change whether you're on Earth, the moon, in space, or on the ""surface"" of Jupiter.  

A gram is the basic unit of mass in the metric system.  It's pretty small - it's about the weight of a dollar bill.  Not much to it. 

A gram can be divided as follows: 

* 1000 milligrams

A milligram is about the weight of a small snowflake. 

A gram is much more often combined into larger units

* a Kilogram is 1000 grams

A kilogram is exactly one liter of water (a Nalgene of water

Other important things about metric mass:

Water weighs almost precisely 1 gram per milliliter

When talking about really heavy things

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Volume
The basic unit of volume is the liter.  It's a pretty familiar unit here in the US

A liter can be divided as follows:

* 10 deciliters (common in cooking)
* 1000 milliliters (common)

A deciliter is about as much juice as you'd get from a large orange.  

A milliliter is very useful for measuring small volumes of things.  It's about the volume of a large blueberry.  

When talking about volumes above one liter, such as swimming pools, or the Earth's oceans, the cubic meter is normally used.  A standard olympic pool holds about 2500 cubic meters of water, or enough to fill over 6000 kiddie pools. 

In some countries the kiloliter and megaliter are used

Liquid medicine is often dosed out in milliliters, and 15 ml being common doses.  A test tube normally holds about 10 milliliters.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Temperature

This is a tricky one

The metric unit of temperature is the degree celcius.  The scale sets water freezing at 0 degrees and water boiling at 100 degrees.  There are no names for the divided units

So you just have to remember this scale (from a northerner's perspective):

-20: ""Snot freezing cold"" - the insides of your nose freeze.

-10: ""Really freaking cold"" - but your nose isn't frozen. 

0:    Water freezes. 

10:   ""A brisk fall day""

20:   ""Room Temperature""

30:   ""Honey

37:   Standard human temperature

40:   ""Time to go to the doctor for that fever""

50:   ""Dear God I'm going to die""

60:   Hot Coffee

70:   Beef is well done

80:   Brewing Tea

90:   Your computer chip is about to overheat

100: Water boils

180: Standard cooking temperature in an oven

250: Paper will spontaneously ignite ([debated](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/explainer/2012/06/ray_bradbury_death_does_paper_really_burn_at_451_degrees_fahrenheit_.html))

                  = 66 ft × 660 ft × 1 in

A similar calculation could also be done for cubic feet

The calculation is similar for determining how much water falls on a roof and flows into a rain water tank.

It was hard at first having to do the calculations (F = 9/5C + 32), it's 18 degrees? No wonder I'm so cold. Holy cow, 27 degrees? My computer's really heatin' this room up.

Of course

For us imperialists, but it becomes second nature with practice. We obviously can't change our imperial mindset all at once, but it is possible to start thinking metric, be it one or two units at a time.

So pick a commonly used unit and start converting it whenever you encounter it. Try converting speed limits while driving. Or start switching people's height to centimeters. It's a hassle at first, you'll think ""Holy cow what a giant.""

Consequently
From Wikipedia...

But the survey foot was the old foot.

""International"" foot: 0.3048 m (why they didn't just make it exactly 30 centimeters is beyond me)

Survey foot: 0.3048006096 m ...ahh, the international foot 30 cm exactly, heck, 33.33333... meters abolishing the yard and calling it just a meter, that way the metric system would already be ingrained into the imperial system muhahahah, but thats besides the point.

Which leads to my next point:
They REFUSED to change everything on maps to the new foot.
So we are left with two kinds of feet. Why does this matter? Well when we started to adopt the metric system, like electric, lumens, kwh/100 MILES for electric cars (this is called a hybrid unit but still makes use of SI instead of horsepower... MILES is there because thats what the roads are in...) Then we stated caring about how much is in our food and drinks and now measure it in grams, miligrams, and 240 mililiters for a metric cup - as opposed to 8 oz - same thing with the international foot thing I went over before, why not 250 mL? And all high tech stuff is done in SI, kilohertz, and volts

Now on to our half ass units...

We have mil(li-inches) which is 0.001 of an inch or 25.4 micrometers-hmm 2.45 cm/1000 WOAH base 10 conversion

Then we have these poor attempts apply SI units to imperial terms:

kilofeet 1000 feet or 333.333... yards (suffers the same repeating number defect as dividing a meter up 3 times)

kiloyard 1000 yards or pretty darn close to a km

kilopound - half a ton and close to half a tonne- 1000 pounds

But wait

When you buy gas
When you buy cut meats and deli meats

Then people say the dollar is metric and ""cent"" is kinda short for centidollar... this is how they taught the metric system in school

Applying SI units to imperial terms would be like trying to hook a telegraph up to a 4g network or VoIP line (that would be ToIP - Telegraph over IP)...

Tl;dr: if you think we can adapt the metric system

I just did a search in /r/metric's search function (hilarious function, and its mention is about removing it.  Sad.  Fortunately the deciliter made it through.

The decimeter I feel is highly ignored, maybe not the average, but its about the average, work with me here) in metric that's 1.75m or 175cm.  There are two things that don't sit well with this.  One is way too small of a number to feel significant, and the other is way large of a number to keep track.  It seems like there needs to be a happy medium.

Oh but wait, 6'1"", 5'3"" etc) but its a lot closer to the other alternatives. 


There's one more reason that I feel that the decimeter needs more representation for american society to feel comfortable with the metric system.  This is that it is base 10.  Think about it.  Right now, you should never cut corners.  That's just what we're doing.  We're cutting corners, the decimeter.  Sure, in scientific practice (i'm not a scientist) I can see it to be practical to cut corners, take shortcuts.  I know that 36 meters is 36,000 millimeters.  Theres no need to convert to decimeters, then to centimeters

**tl;dr:  I feel strongly that putting more emphasis on the decimeter and not ignoring its existence will help americans adjust to the metric system by a)feeling more familiar, and b) closing the gap that commonly exists between centimeters and meters (literally the job of the decimeter...)**

**It's universal**

(Nearly) everyone in the world uses it. If you travel abroad or communicate online

Currently, Canada and the UK have only adopted it in some areas. Hopefully, eventually everyone will use it!

**It's easier to work with and convert**

The subunits in Metric are all based around powers of ten. Milli, so 1km is 10^3 m and 1kg is 10^3 g. This is very different to Imperial units where there are strange, varying and seemingly arbitrary multipliers (eg. 1 mile is 1760 yards). This also makes metric to metric conversions easier. Multiplying and dividing by ten is very easy, as we use base 10, so it's just a case of moving the decimal point 3, 6, 9... places in the correct direction.

**It has a larger range of units**

With its prefixes, which are often easier to work with. In different contexts you can pick the prefix you want to use and stick with it. Say I'm building something, I choose to use millimetres. Areas will be in mm^2 and volumes in mm^3 . I don't need precision less than 1mm, so I will always deal with whole numbers and won't need to do conversions. Whereas, particle physicists may want to use femtometres, and won't have to worry about 0.000000000000001m (or worse, 3.93700787 × 10^-14 inches).

**It's based on natural constants**

Each of the [base units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit) are defined in terms of a repeatable experiment, 1 metre is defined as the distance travelled by light in 1/299,792,458 of a second. This also means units will never vary, and their value can be determined far more reliably than imperial units which use vague and varying quantities (the grain for example, which ounces and pounds are based on, was the mass of a single seed of a cereal or now 64.79891 milligrams

There is one exception to this however, and the [CIPM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures) is working to find a better, more precise definition.

**Its derived units work nicely**

Say we have a formula, is in kilograms (kg). v, velocity (speed), is in metres per second (m/s). Kilograms, metres and seconds are all SI Base Units, so we know the unit of E, energy will be in Joules (J). This is easier than saying kgm/s, whereas the Joule is determined purely in terms of Base Units. [Derived Units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_derived_unit) are really just shorthand for different combinations of Base Units.

Dear Mr. Butcher:

Re: Metric-Only Option for U.S. Food Manufacturers On behalf of the Food Marketing Institute (FMI)1
comments on a metric-only option for U.S. food manufacturers of consumer goods. As you know

FMI does not support the use of metric-only. Metric-only would not be of any value to the U.S. retailer community or to most consumers in America. Below is an outline of numerous points of concern that FMI has regarding the metric-only option:

1 Food Marketing Institute (FMI) conducts programs in research,300 member companies — food retailers and wholesalers — in the United States and around the world. FMI’s U.S. members operate approximately 26,000 retail food stores with a combined annual sales volume of $340 billion — three-quarters of all food retail store sales in the United States. FMI’s retail membership is composed of large multi-store chains, regional firms and independent supermarkets. Its international membership includes 200 companies from 60
countries.

? The majority of consumers do not understand metric measurements. Moreover

? Value-comparison between similar products of various sizes may be difficult to determine for consumers if some manufacturers use the metric-only option and others use inch/pound.

? Retailers will be faced with consumer complaints when value-comparison cannot be determined.

? International interpretations of metric requirements would likely result in package size changes.

? Changes in package sizes will make certain display cases

? Metric will also impact other types of equipment in the grocery store, scanners, computers, and other types of measurement equipment, requiring costly conversion or replacement.

? Shipping cases will even have to be replaced if metric-only is an option.

? A metric-only option may conflict with domestic feeding programs.

? Packagers may change display-only in metric units and that will require changes in unit pricing labels.

? There is a cost for the retailer associated with label changes

? Retailers typically keep a label inventory of about 50 weeks.

? Retailer’s operating companies forecast what business might be like in the future (ex: tomatoes) and make future labels accordingly (thus

@Erithacus
Disingenuous? Sir

If my memory serves

1) Consumers aren’t clamoring, fruit juices, olive oil, many personal hygiene products) and they are spoken of in those metric sizes. I believe no one would care if the Customary went away.

2) No products use ONLY inch-pound. That would be illegal. All products currently have both. If some products had only metric
4) NIST has made clear that the amendment does not require round or standard metric sizes. A 1 lb/453 g package could just be labelled 453 g. However, more sensible size., whether 400, 450 or 500 g.

5) Manufacturers fight for shelf space. They would work with their retailers in deciding the physicals of a proposed new package. They change sizes all the time now and the world doesn’t end. The “pound” of coffee shrank to 13 oz

6) The law requires no size or unit change. However, probably just order new equipment that works in either unit system.

8) Can’t comment except they should develop details and demand Congress fix it if they can really substantiate their concern.

9) Unit pricing law allows unit pricing choice of one or two Customary and one or two metric units in all cases. “Like product” in the same store must all make the same choice. Retailers could switch to metric unit pricing now or in anticipation of the law. However

10, and responds to other stores price changes. No way do I believe this is all known and planned 50 weeks in advance. This claim boggles the mind.

13) If the package size is not changed, some changes will be required. Where the public already refers to round metric sizes (2 L soda), the stores advertise that way, NOT as 67.6 FL OZ (2 QT 3.6 FL OZ) although all three are on the bottle.

We all know they are lying. We don’t know if they talk their Congressman into voting against the amendment.

The basic principles of metrication are:

1. Do not convert back and forth between metric and US customary or imperial units.
2. Avoid using the old system as much as possible.
2. Learn to comprehend the new measurements by familiarising yourself with various points of reference.

I'll get it started with a list of what I know about in the comments.

The reasoning is that inches can be expressed in decimals to any number of digits as needed for a particular accuracy.  True

Americans are never taught decimal inches when young and a common ruler never shows decimal inches

Even if later in life, there is a disconnect between those who understand decimals to some degree and those that don't.

An inch draftsman once told me that non-fractional inches were not real inches.  Real inches in decimal were just decimal equivalents of fractions.  This came about when he insisted I tell him in inches the distance of some mounting holes on an electrical component where the mounting holes were 50 mm apart and the inches were 1.9685 inches.

In metric design

I can't recall ever seeing an inch measuring device, where 1/32 becomes 0.031 inches.  This severely reduces the accuracy of manufacturing.

If it was necessary to punch a series of holes in a line and the spacing had to be 4-7/32 inches ( 4.21875) and the number had to be rounded to 3 places

I'm sure you can make it work

With millimetres none of these problems exist.  Everyone from a young age is taught decimals

ACWM Americans for Customary Weight and Measure Wrong. Japan

The Spanish Pound (Libra) is used in South America alongside the Pound Avoirdupois.

Japanese homes and acreage is measured in tsubo.

Basically

Destroying the cultural heritage of traditional measures through abolition is like banning books. Have you read ""1984?"" That is probably why even diehard UK Metricators often shy away from abolishing the pint.

We can't think of any countries that collapsed due to metrication, the French Revolution. Did that result in a more ordered nation, or result in chaos and a reign of terror? Look at what the theory of a perfect set of scientific ideals and how it actually manifested itself. It caused such chaos that Napoleon himself devised ""Measures Usuelles"" (sp?) in an attempt to allay the populace's confusion.

We are committed to diversity and culture, and we are committed to ensuring their future, whether that means educating the population on our wonderful system and why it is designed the way it is, launching petitions and campaigns to counteract any attacks on the continued legality and existence of our system, or even taking to the streets to halt the attempts to metricate or alter our national heritage and infrastructure. Thankfully, we haven't had to take to the streets to prevent illegal roadsigns, our regulators have figured out that metric signs aren't used and have removed them as they wear out on the only interstate to use that signage

In the '70s, bureaucratically as it did in Canada, the UK. Some industry converted where it suited them, others did not and continue to use our system today, both here and abroad.

Just as IKEA has no problem selling all-metric products, exact units are of no consequence to the general population as long as they are smaller than a certain size.

What do you see the reversal of metrication mandates in Canada and the UK as signs of? The intentional embrace of societal and economic collapse by these nations, and heritage by craftsmen and artisans?

Common metric products are often divisible into equal rounded thirds

The one place where a USC/imperial size can be divided into thirds is the length units, 600 mm, 1200 mm, 2400 mm, 4800 mm are all standard sizes and can be divided into rounded thirds.

These obsolete terms need to be resurrected to make the expression of volumes simpler:

1 are = 1 m x 1 m = 1 m^2
1 dekare = 10 m x 10 m = 100 m^2
1 hecatare = 100 m x 100 m = 10 000 m^2
1 kilare = 1000 m x 1000 m = 1 000 000 m^2

1 deciare = 0.1 m x 0.1 m = 0.01 m^2
1 centiare = 0.01 m x 0.01 m = 0.0001 m^2
1 milliare = 0.001 m x 0.001 m = 0.000001 m^2

etc.

1 stere = 1 m x 1 m x 1 m = 1 m^3

1 hectostere = 100 m x 100 m x 100 m = 1 000 000 m^3
1 kilostere = 1000 m x 1000 m x 1000 m = 1 000 000 000 m^3

1 decistere = 0.1 m x 0.1 m x 0.1 m = 0.001 m^3 (= 1 L)
1 centistere = 0.01 m x 0.01 m x 0.01 m = 0.000 001 m^3 (1 mL)
1 millistere = 0.001 m x 0.001 m x 0.001 m = 0.000 000 001 m^3 (1 µL).

Why is this so?

The author has a degree in biology, and to know about the metric system. If she obtains her source material from scientists, it is going to be in metric measurements. All of the readers outside the US are going to be users of the metric system.

So why has it all been translated to miles
