1368252396.0,1e47zx,"The ultimate Anime Wallpaper Collection: 13,000 wallpapers + 3,000 Anime Images, Gifs and Scans",dreapsp,215,

I am dreapsp/frontalspy and here I have uploaded a large chunk of anime images I have collected over the past year or so. There are over 13, which are not wallpapers and are more general images, gifs and official scans. In total, there is about **16gb** worth of anime images that I have uploaded, and it isn't all I have. Most of the anime wallpapers I have gotten are from dumps and bundles, and there *will* be duplicates even though I have used a software to sort that out. 

Anyways, Mediafire, Minus, Imgur and Torrent. So without further-ado, here are the links:

*****
**Download Links**

* **Mediafire:** All parts are split up into ~200mb parts so there are quite a number of things to download. The parts are all separate so you don't need any software to join them up.

 [**Medifire Link**](http://www.mediafire.com/?w49fti6qyne9es5,ndr31jkmwwuh4d8,qt4h7n4bllho9e1,nkqu616agv6l611,8heeakvapxfnbyz,ss2ufj73sz2b897,83wcopizdhlvi33,41oqng4lnbea6lr,uu4ikstxfz5cr44,8if6u6qqn3jj111
                  


* **Mega:** All links are split up into 1000 images

 [**Mega Link**](https://mega.co.nz/#F!ex5xQDSA!SF4irFgTP_VHsr0TIFXERw)

* **Minus:** There are two different profiles; one has all the anime wallpapers and the other have all the other anime images since I would hit the 10gb upload limit. As of now

 [**Anime Wallpapers** (13

 [**Other Anime Images** (3

* **Imgur:** My Imgur folder is the least up to date
 [**Imgur Link**](http://frontalspy.imgur.com/)

* **Torrent:** If you want to download everything nice and easy

And that is all I have for now. If you want to know how many anime images I have in total
 *17.69 GB on disk (17,313 bytes) for 38,687 items*

*****
**Frequently Asked Questions**

1. What anime is *X* from?

 I would have almost no idea which anime the image would be from. Your best bet would be to do a reverse google image search to find out where the image is from and what anime it is from, should be fine.

2. Why are there many images that appear more than once?  
  There are bound to be duplicates since most of the wallpapers are from numerous dumps. In the image hosting sites,000 images. I have used a program that identified similar images which removed about 600 images, but there are about 100 duplicates left. I am sorry that I don't remember which images I have downloaded and cannot get rid of the images. 

3. I am thinking of sharing your links

i feel the need to write this down because some people might not be aware of the negative influence their comments have on the experience of new audience to shows they might sincerely love and wish to promote.*

let's say you're a big fan of anime X. anime X has good value on its own but has certain moments that took you by surprise and you had no idea they were coming. the sheer impact of said moment

- you're eased into a feeling of comfort with the way the scenario is unfolding and your best educated guesses fall into the range of predictability the authors were counting on.

this is where the problem arises. when promoting their favourite/beloved anime series some viewers feel the need to point out in some way that the plot does not fall into the regular case and thus break the illusion the show wanted to construct so diligently. 

quotes used for this often include

- let me know what you think after episode Y
- wait until you get to the end of Z arc.
- pun/funny-witty retort around T scene which gives away huge amounts of plot.

after hearing this

and then there's hype.. since it may not even be a single moment

methods to avoid such hasty and counter-productive things are:

- lie to them: X is about cute girls doing cute things
- appeal to their confidence in your taste: just trust me
- point out a secondary appeal factor the show may have: it's only 12 episodes long
- mention you gave that show a 10/10 or 9/10.. but do not tell them why.

i realize some people may just feel proud having seen a show and knowing the story and what happens in it but [please try to hold it in](http://i.minus.com/iKURNy7Stf8L8.gif) and **advertise responsibly**. if you come across people saying a critically acclaimed

**please do your best to let people form their own independent opinion** and then flood them with [your own.](http://i.imgur.com/gp0cmOh.gif)

I moved to Japan (from the US) having no clue how to break into the anime industry, and after two years

EDIT:  Gonna take a break and get some food.  Will be back to answer more 
questions soon!

**UPDATE:**  Thought I'd answer some of the FAQs...
  
* The show that inspired me to move to Japan:  The Vision of Escaflowne
  
* Favorite anime:  Ghibli (Laputa: Castle in the Sky, Seirei no Moribito, Death Note... currently hooked on One Piece, Hunter x Hunter, and Bakuman.

* What I'm doing now:  I left Japan in late 2006 because the work conditions were draining my will to live.  After returning to the US

**UPDATE 2:**  It's 3am PST.  Bed time!  I'll be back tomorrow to answer more questions.  Thanks for the great conversation!    

**UPDATE 3:**  Some of you have expressed interest in learning how to make anime.  This has inspired me and my husband to consider making some ""how to anime"" DVD tutorials.  If a tutorial existed,False,self,t5_2qh22,1345973194.0,,,t3_ysgh2

(You might want to sit down

I'd put off watching this second season for a decent while, it didn't really resonate with me at all until that last, basically perfect episode. And second, from everything I'd read online, it seemed like the second season amped the fanservice up to 11. And fanservice, well...

It's bad. The way it's normally used, and not simply the best framing device for the story being told. It adds to a value unrelated to a show as an artistic work, and in fact normally detracts from its artistic worth and the narrative/emotional weight of any scene. It demeans the *audience* as well, implying we're unable to be entertained by the show's actual worth, and the implications regarding my base-instinct-oriented nature colors my experience as a viewer. It proves that the creators of the show are not taking that show and its characters seriously – and if they're not, why the fuck should I?

However

Nisemonogatari is not interested in fanservice.

Nisemonogatari is a show *specifically about* sexuality, I know it's not an actual camera, bear with me).

Most fan service happens by making the camera take the perspective of an outsider, women are framed in a way that accentuates their sexuality not because that's how they see themselves, but *just because the cameraman finds that sexy.*

In Nisemonogatari

Example 1: the scene with Nadeko.

In this scene, and most of the humor of the scene is drawn from the contrast between her fumbling, obvious advances and Araragi's upbeat obliviousness. This is the first of many scenes where a female character attempts to use her sexuality as a weapon, and Araragi's responses make it clear that the camera is not from his male perspective – it is portraying the way she is attempting but failing to be perceived. Additionally, this is the first of countless scenes where almost all the emotional content of the exchange is contained in the *direction*, not the script. This isn't surprising, considering this show is directed by the great  Akiyuki Shinbo, and his superior

Let's run through a few more examples. The next scene, they even go so far as to incorporate a traditionally grossly fanservicey shot (a crotch shot), but because of her outfit and stance, it's totally neutral. At this point in time, neither of these characters consider the other sexually at all, so why would the camera? Shinbo knows what many directors fail to either know or care about – that the positioning of the camera both has a significant emotional effect on the viewer, and *always conveys information*. Information about tone, about stakes

The next scene we're with Kanbaru, because that's the rapport they share. Unlike Nadeko, there is no subtlety in Kanbaru's sexuality, both because that's more representative of her in-your-face personality, and because she just knows Araragi better. She uses her sexuality as a weapon, not to seduce Araragi, but to simply throw him off guard. But again

Skipping ahead, it is trivial – it is not sexualized, and is treated in a way very similar to Horo from Spice and Wolf – it doesn't shy away from it, but also doesn't fetishize or draw attention to it. Meanwhile, in a brief conversation with a fully clothed Hanekawa, the camera is *all about* the character's sexuality. This is because Hanekawa is an inherently seductive presence to Araragi, and they both know it – the sexual tension just barely unacknowledged between them is apparent in the camera's eye. Again, a *huge* amount of information about the relationship the characters share is conveyed through the camerawork alone. Intelligent cinematography is like a freaking superpower.

And now we get to the big one.

Episode 8. Dental hygiene. The last great point of this series.

To me, “brushing teeth should not be this sexy,” and that joke only works if the audience can feel how sexy it is for those characters. And this team is obviously gifted enough to know how to pull off a scene like that.

And that's impressive enough on its own. But what I really think this episode is doing

I think, that Shinbo asked himself, “what do people who love fanservice get out of it? Why are they watching an anime, and not just porn? What does this show have that actual direct sexual gratification lacks?”

Intimacy.

The toothbrush scene is so erotically charged because of the *intimacy* involved, semi-flirtatious charge to it, as they've moved from younger traditional antagonistic siblings to one of those bicker-flirting couples. Then, everything Karen does at the start of this episode is designed to put Araragi off his guard and in a place of intimacy/discomfort. Her outfit does so much work here, and it's all *her intentional, meaningful decision.* First, it serves as a striking contrast against both her normal outfit and her personality – the bee exercise outfit is absolutely *her*, carefree sexlessness is absolutely *her*, the fact that it isn't her outfit, it directly is designed to be sexy

But I was talking about intimacy. So, and a close monologue from Araragi to place the sex stuff in a position of complete *emotional honesty*. Sure, it's also played for humor – but the humor is mostly based on the fact that it's funny brushing teeth can be this sexy, and as I said, for that joke to work at all, the audience has to truly understand that *this scene is sexy to these characters*. Most powerful moments in most media are powerful not just because of the audience's emotional reaction to a situation, but because they can empathize with a character's emotional reaction to a situation. This effect drags us further into the text/film/show and girders our connection with the characters involved – at that moment, all the prep work of this episode works to help us understand these characters completely at this moment, which makes this scene so strong, they're naked

One last tangent, mainly because the characterization in K-On is very difficult to describe as “honest,” but I think *from the point of view that these are valid characters*, K-On attempts to create a continuous mood of emotional honesty and friendly, unabashed intimacy. It invites the viewer into a safe, loving environment free from any of the hidden motives and defenses that characterize the real world, and is always completely honest with the viewer. For those who watch Community, and is willing to share all of its emotional secrets with you. Intimacy porn. I mainly bring this up because there was a thread a few days ago where someone said they like K-On because the characters feel “real.” Now, that's a ridiculous statement – but I think what was really meant there was that the characters feel *honest*

So yeah, in addition to the issues about male gaze, camerawork, storytelling, and perspective he's already addressed, is why fanservice normally hurts shows - it's impersonal and dishonest.

So no, staggeringly coherent statement against it, complete with endless demonstrations of the ways sexuality really can be used to enhance and augment storytelling. And I could not be more freaking impressed.

EDIT:

**Some Trivia**

Here's a Translation Note that's about Eren's catchphrase ""I'll kill every single one of them"". He says in such a way that reinforces the pure hate he ~~feels~~ felt towards the titans.

&gt;""It's been going on for a while now but in Japanese, which is a counter for small animals and bugs, instead of the more appropriate ""ittou"" (一頭), which covers the big ones. This is a means to convey his scorn.""",,False,self,1368383460.0,t3_1e5f4g
