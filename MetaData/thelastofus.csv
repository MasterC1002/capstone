After I beat the game today, something maybe even sinister. I thought more and more about the development of the characters and what the world had become. I ask, did Joel's character suddenly take a sharp turn for the worst? Did he finally succumb to his desperate search for a companion, greedily snatching up Ellie for himself and denying the world its cure? I vote for No, and this is why:


The Ending

*At first* it seemed like Joel had simply snapped. He had lost Sarah, his companion (possibly partner), and it hurt. It might not be too obvious, but Joel actually has the most sensitive personality in the story, but is hidden behind his violence. Evidence of this is his absolute refusal to even acknowledge the deaths of the people he is close to. He tries to hide it under the guise of ""things happen, and we move on"". Joel comes off as a stoic kind of guy, but he actually hurt very easily; ""you are treading on some mighty thin ice"" at Ellie with just the mention of Sarah. Throughout the entire game, someone to trust

With that in mind, where the twisted kidnapper takes a child from her home and raises her under a lie. This was my initial impression. I've read several other interpretations that say Joel is the actual villain in the game, but otherwise likeable due to the great character development throughout the game. I'm not sure I entirely agree with that. I'll explain. I argue that the while Joel's act of saving Ellie was motivated by some selfishness, it is less selfish than what the world wants from her, in that Joel's ending may lead to Ellie living a somewhat enjoyable life with Joel. Ellie can learn how to play the guitar and how to swim. She can do what defines us as human beings from animals. Meanwhile, the rest of Mankind just wants a cure and then they can go back to killing and cannibalizing each other (only without the interruption of infected).

Okay so: the kidnapping. At the very start of the level, after the game, and I think many people may have realized about this before even reaching the last chapter, but why the hell do we even want to save Mankind anymore. Any nice people are few and far in between (or dead). You've killed so many people, but they only want to kill you back to survive. The title of the game is ""The Last of Us"" This plays on the central them of Us vs Them. While the infected certainly belong to the ""Them"" side, it is interesting that practically everyone else (besides Joel and Ellie) can also be lumped with ""Them"". There is a rather wide disconnect between Joel and Ellie vs the rest of everyone else, even among allies. They are paired against the world. There is a constant feeling of danger everywhere. The only place of absolute peace is when Joel and Ellie are staring out onto the field with the Giraffes, how can people possibly return to normality after so long brutally surviving. So why should Joel sacrifice the only person left in the world who he cares about to save some goddamn rotten Mankind. The Fireflies want a cure, who have all but mercilessly wiped all of their friends out? What prevents them from keeping the cure to themselves, another question lingers: Should this have been Ellie's choice?

Given from Ellie's depression in the previous level, is this the morally right path? Mankind is fucked up. According to the Fireflies, the only way to save it is to use Ellie's life. Let's look at the weight of this action again: The only way to save Man is to cut up a little girl and to study her brain? The game makes a clear distinction between Mankind and Humanity here. If the Joel had let the Fireflies sacrifice Ellie, then this Mankind as species may be saved, but at the cost of the last piece of humanity that we have seen in the story: the relationship between Joel and Ellie. (Tommy's camp may be seen as an exception, but as foreshadowed in the game, how long can they really last being continually picked apart by the outside? A larger questions looms, if Joel saves Ellie, Joel's decision was selfish, given the state of the world

The last few lines of the game reveal that Ellie had been dealing with ""survivor's guilt, that she could somehow repay her friend. Ellie is essentially a slave to this guilt, sacrificing herself is not something she wants to do at all, but rather this is something she feels like she *has* to do. In the previous section, Ellie recalls having a dream in which she is in a crashing plane and that, although she is in the cockpit, she can't change course because she doesn't know how to pilot the plane. This is a metaphor for her spiraling path towards her ultimate sacrifice. She WANTS control, Joel."" Joel prevents her from having to take this unfair path by saving her from the hospital. In a time when it seemed like there were only two choices, nature seems to be doing just fine without people around at all. From Ellie's point of view, Ellie asks Joel if everything he told her about the Fireflies was true (that they don't need her for a cure anymore)

So this is my interpretation. I've been seeing a lot of people feel depressed after finishing the game, so feel free to debate.",Spoiler,False,self,t5_2t7gp,1372122313.0,,

Before you even get halfway through with it you just want to lay down and quit. But you know you can't. You feel obligated to keep going and see this through to the end. I've never wanted to not finish and simultaneously finish a game before. 

Survival isn't easy in this game. You have to do whatever you can to live one more day. Shiv-ing a guy in the neck. Blowing a guy to pieces with a nail bomb. Burning him alive with a flamethrower.

1372848795.0,1hk6c1,"[SPOILERS, Mega Discussion!] Animal Symbolism, the threat of humans, the loss of faith in humanity and more…",keftih,23, I think there’s a lot more to the picture here that is not being taken into account. I’m not sure how many people are willing to enter long discussions about symbolism and themes (or if people will even make it to the end of this) but perhaps one day someone will finish the game and stumble upon this post. Here are four points here that I would like to present.

1. The symbolism of Deer and Giraffe
2. The greater threat of Man in contrast to the infection
3. The loss of faith in humanity
4. Henry and Sam

Stag symbolism is a recurring symbol that is present in three significant locations that I can recall: A painting above Joel’s bed in his room (in the prologue), these images appear right before (arguably) the greatest dangers in the game. Namely, these are: the soldier that kills Sarah, the introduction of David, and the fireflies (for the surgery of Ellie). Perhaps even more peculiar is the fact that in all three circumstances, it was people, and not the infected, this isn’t a “zombie” game

From our perspective in the comforts of our mostly intact society, after 20 years of losing battles, the game shows us that the conflict has actually evolved, the true war has become Man against himself. In other words, **at some point after the outbreak, the responsibility for the demise of Man passed from the infected to humans**. The infected were just a catalyst, breaking down the restricting walls of society. However, people began to do anything they could to survive at the cost of others. Humanity began to wage war against itself. Let’s go through each deer appearance.

The deer above Joel bed: As you recall, because they are the primary threat... right? However, what happens next. The soldier fires his gun, *easily* dispatching the infected, and kills Sarah (and almost Joel too). Yes, Joel was running from the threat of the infected, but who ultimately killed Sarah? It is perhaps ironic, yet in reality he was running towards the greater danger. It is important to point out that *it is at this is the point where Joel loses his faith in humanity.* Humans aren't allies, Joel is hesitant to personally continue the journey. This is because even with a vaccine, intelligence. Both groups want to kill you

The deer Ellie hunts: This one is rather straight forward. Ellie hunts the deer (representing Man’s war against nature), arguably the greatest threat you have faced up to this point in the game. The infected somehow show up, drawing the attention once again to them. Yet, the larger danger was with you the whole time: David. It is at the end of Winter chapter that Ellie loses her faith in humanity.

The deer carving at the beginning of Spring: This is the most important one as it sets the stage for the ending and whether you can say it was a “happy” one or not. While the deer once again represents the looming danger of Man in spite of the infected, that the world was just like the quarantine zone, that despite its flaws, may be worth saving. Her journey with Joel has proven otherwise to her, with the turning factor being David's camp. This is the reason for her sadness during Spring. She may be haunted by her clash with David, but there is an even deeper depression caused by the fact that Ellie is compelled by her survivor’s guilt to seek a vaccine, but for a cause that she may no longer believe in. This is the primary reason Ellie accepts Joel’s lie at the end of the game. She accepts this lie as a way to escape from a life, in order to save a race that she no longer believes in. This internal conflict is explained by an allegory in Spring, metaphorically steering her away from the crash course. This wasn't really her decision

What about the giraffes? First of all, Ellie is cheered up by the sight of giraffes because they represent the continuation of life, even with the absence of Mankind. This gives her hope that, despite what people may think, the extinction of Man is not the end of the world. If Ellie’s faith is no longer with humanity, she can place it in nature.

Finally, they only take what they need, they give second chances, and they strive for relics of society (namely, the toy robot and motorcycle). They don’t exist simply to survive, they exist to live. The infection of Sam is a parallel to the beginning of the game. His infection was an outbreak no one expected, paralleling the loss of an innocent. The infection “kills” him (Is he actually dead? Or just converted into a different organism?) and the Henry kills him. Again the focus here is on the infected. However, Henry then turns the gun on himself. This symbolizes Man’s war with nature evolving into Man’s war on Man

So there’s a lot of topics here that I covered

There have been other threads here discussing Joel's choice at the end. I think I might have a something new to offer.

You see the world Joel's been living in for 20 years is one that has

In one way or the other all these things at least potentially serve a larger group while a smaller group is harmed.

Hell

I was first leaning towards sacrificing Ellie to possibly help humanity as a whole. But I'm really no longer sure this is a good thing. I now view it as an idealistic view by youngens and revolutionaries.

The world Joel's been living in is an inhumane one. I'm not sure it deserves saving. It certainly does not deserve grave sacrifices.

Besides, is if the people being sacrificied decide to do so. It is noble to save someone and give one's own live. It is not if you're forced to do it.

Ellie could not make that decision. Though mature for her age she did not yet know what she would be giving up. Had she been ten years older

Joel decided not to

Joel saved Ellie for Ellie because he cared about her more then he cared about himself. How is that selfish? 

Ellie never consented to being killed to find a cure

After finding the notes, a cure wouldn't have really changed the world as they knew it anyway as the infected weren't as big a threat as other survivors were.

Joel figured out that Marlene was full of shit

Keep in mind it was Marlene who manipulated Ellie, even though she likely  knew from the beginning that Ellie would not survive the procedure.

In the end, radical, and selfish. While Marlene convinced herself she was doing all of this for the greater good, it seemed clear she had lost her way.

The fact Joel lies to Ellie in the end was to protect her from finding out Marlene and the Fireflies intended to sacrifice her all along.

Thanks to Joel, it wasn't her fault she was manipulated by Marlene). That was a selfless act to protect Ellie, not himself.

1371522690.0,1gk61o,[BIG SPOILERS] My interpretation about the choice of clothing for Joel/ Ellie,sootybest,141,19,40,"So feel free to say I'm looking into this too deeply
might appreciate/ expand on it.

So first the obvious stuff. Ellie wears pink on her upper body in every season except for one- in the epilogue-y section of Spring. The is notable because Sarah also is shown wearing pink in the scenes she's in. The parallels are obvious (though it might be worth mentioning it could be significant Sarah wears pink on her lower body). The only other character really to wear pink is Tess, harmony, compassion, innocence etc. Simply, it seems that Ellie wears this because she is the compassionate foil to Joel. In contrast, Tess wearing a much darker shade shows that although she is a tough and brutal survivor character, deep down she also has shreds of compassion

In the epilogue, now. One would probably want to call it blood red. To me, this calls back the very end of the winter season. After Ellie kills David and leaves with Joel, the camera pans back to the machete, covered in blood. The first time I saw this, I recognised it as a sign of a loss of innocence. Ellie has killed before in the story, but never so brutally or impulsively. To be wearing this colour in the epilogue after wearing a colour of innocence for the entirety of the game speaks volumes of how Ellie's character has changed, whether she is aware of it or not.

But it's not just the change of colour of her shirt, hoodie, and casual shirt all with pink on it, the red clothing is a flannel shirt. One that looks very similar not only to Joel's shirts in general but specifically the ones he wore in the fall/ winter months. So this single piece of clothing shows how Ellie has lost her innocence/embraced her brutal life-style with its colour, but it also tells us that in doing so she has become more like Joel. I find this a lovely little taste of irony, and it's irony because at this point in the story, even Joel is pretty conscious that he sees Ellie as a surrogate Sarah (he says ""you keep finding something to fight for"" in the epilogue, it is now Ellie). But at this point in the story

If Ellie's clothing show the dynamic nature of her character

Joel wearing a khaki green survivalist-type shirt in the summer section. Key word 'survivalist'. He does what it takes to survive. Simple. He wears similar button up flannel shirt in the fall/ winter. OK. But in the spring, the clothing tells us he hasn't changed at the core. He is an anti-hero. The decisions he makes at the end of the game are the same ones that he would have made if in the same situation at the beginning of the game. And this is the shirt he is wearing when he tells Ellie that it's not too late to turn back. This is the shirt he is wearing when he says ""I guess you can't outrun your past"" (in response to Ellie handing him the photo of him and Sarah). This is the shirt he is wearing when he decides to rescue Ellie in the hospital. This is the shirt he is wearing when he reaffirms the lie about the Fireflies. He hasn't learnt a lesson or become a better person, and the moral implications of this in these situations are very interesting.

I think it's also important to point out that Ellie doesn't end up wearing a khaki green survivalist shirt

On that note, but has had to put on a shell of Joel's survivalist morality on top. This is apt given these are the parts of the game you actually have to play as her, literally using the same techniques that you used to play as Joel.

Lastly, that David pretty much wears the same outfit as Ellie ( he wears a pink shirt instead of a pink hoodie). I am still a bit conflicted about how to interpret this. Does it point to the thing David says to Ellie about ""you kill to survive and I kill to survive, how are we different?"" Is David a reflection of Ellie, and in killing him, staining his clothing red with blood, is she effectively killing her own innocence?

The Winter segment was perfectly timed to start sowing that seed of doubt in the player's mind. In the university

The cannibal scene near the end of Winter is very reminiscent of the surgery scene at the end of the game - for a start it's visually similar. Ellie is helpless, in Winter it's Ellie who takes the initiative, escaping, drawing the enemies away from Joel (and killing a lot of them, depending on how you played - although there's some that you're unable to stealth past), and ultimately killing David.

So when the ending comes around, but is glad that she didn't have to be the one who made that choice.

But what you all have to understand is Joel didn't have time to consider all this. He didn't spend hours before the surgery trying to weigh the pros and cons. He knew Ellie was going to die

But what was really going on here was just Joel caring too much about Ellie to let her be killed by the Fireflies. He's risked his life at least twice to save her, he saved Ellie. That's all it was to him. And I think that's more important than whether the cure would work, or whether the Fireflies would abuse it.

1372221096.0,1h36m1,Ellie's Dream [FULL GAME SPOILERS],Socrates-Johnson,82,3,22,"Just finished my Survivor run yesterday

Ellie's dream basically consists of her being in an airplane that is going down. She heads into the cockpit to find that there is nobody piloting the plane, and so it crashes - though she wakes up just as it does so. 

To me, with respect to the threat that it presents to the continuation of humanity, is represented by the plane's impending crash. This is pretty clearcut. What is more interesting is Ellie's attempt to save the plane from its fate, and her perseverance, even in the face of the realization that she is ill-equipped to handle such complex machinery. She is willing to take the risk of going down with the plane, in the hopes that she may somehow save the other passengers. This realization is in keeping with what we might expect from Ellie and her philosophy, especially given her speech at the end of the game, and as others have in the quest to save - or at least to preserve - humanity). 

But this illusory death - and her desire to die to save humanity - is ultimately a futile one

She can't stop the plane from crashing, such a suggestion would be correct. However, this inability to save humanity, as with the inability to fly the plane, has less to do with outside interference or her literal ability to save humankind, and more to do with the inexperience of youth, and the impotence that comes with it. Ellie cannot save the plane because she is too young to be able to do so by herself. She has not lived enough to have learned how to fly a plane,"" is only further testament to this fact.

Joel's response to her confession, and will have literal ramifications in the next act, when he saves her from a death she might otherwise have consented to. Though he might have his own selfish reasons for keeping her alive, it is fairly evident that he doesn't believe she is yet capable of deciding for herself. And indeed, this idea of Ellie lacking the capacity to provide consent is repeated through the fact that, between losing consciousness after attempting to save Joel, and later being rescued by him, or giving her time to agree. 
 
It is apt that she should be sleeping, and at which point her dream and her reality may finally come to be one. But Joel wakes her up from this sleep, and the impending crash of her death, just as she is woken up before the crash in her dream. It is possible that there is an irony here; waking up from her original dream might have meant the prolongation of humanity's ""plane ride,"" while waking up from what should have been her final dream might spell the inevitable crash of that plane. 

I contend, in each of these scenarios, will keep flying, though it does so without a pilot for the time being. One day, when she is equipped to do so, Ellie will take the controls and fly it home. But that day is not today. ",,self,,

I've been skimming discussion forums and reddit to see what people thought about it and I'm somewhat surprised to see that a common interpretation seems to be ""Joel decided humanity wasn't worth saving besides Ellie"" or ""Joel gave up on humanity""

I would argue that Joel actually *chose humanity* by choosing Ellie over a potential vaccine. Ellie is a human being whose individual life and choice matters, as opposed to the inhuman one - to walk away from that situation he would have had to bury the human instinct to protect people you love, the same instinct that he tried to kill for 20 years. And he chose not to do that again, he chose to be human.

I'm not saying that what Joel does isn't morally ambiguous, both for Joel and for the group they're going to join at the end of the game.

I also don't think the overall message the game wanted to send was just ""people suck"". You do meet many bad people doing bad things to each other throughout the game

Joel is no hero. Hell

Imagine yourself as a hunter. You and your best friend surviving in the city with some guys who have the same viewpoints as you. Sure, and you do your best to keep people alive. Now imagine hearing they all died. Just like that. By an old man and a little girl. No one ever got a good look at them, but they're dropping your friends like flies. Who is the bad guy in this situation?

Joel is by no means a good person. Even before the apocalypse started. He has good intentions

Joel is alive 20 years later because he knew where to place his morality from the get-go. And that was to throw it away. By the time the game starts,"" or the Fireflies.

Then Ellie comes along. At first he's hesitant to get to know her, humanity tried to kill him more times than the Infected.

Sure, but she doesn't. She chose to save one man's humanity, rather than a world from infection. She gave him his humanity back, and I believe that it's enough for her to go on with his charade. She doesn't believe him, but I think that she's content.

I don't really know what else to say. The same words keep floating in my head; grueling, draining. There it is. This game has absolutely drained me. I am in shock over how they managed to do this, and so impressed, but I never want to play this game again. I'm going to lay down right now.

There are certain facts that need to be established before I go on.

* Joel was unconscious at most for a few hours before waking at the Fireflies hospital in Salt Lake City. It would be ridiculous to think that a thump on the head would keep him out for much longer than that and the fact that they arrive at the hospital in what appears to be early afternoon and depart at what appears to be evening supports this.  
* Marlene's journal states that her men asking for her permission to proceed with the surgery was purely a formality
* Ellie wakes in Joel's car after being taken from the hospital and asks what it is she's wearing

What does this all add up to? Any experimentation that the Fireflies performed on Ellie must have been cursory to the extreme prior to deciding that they needed to *remove Ellie's brain* and they never asked Ellie's permission to proceed with the operation or even informed her of the consequences. Ellie likely remained unconscious the entire time from the moment she and Joel arrived.

After performing what could've only been the most basic of tests

To make matters worse, that's monstrous.

But the real irony in the ending of The Last of Us is that the Fireflies brought their ultimate downfall on themselves. Everything that happened could've been avoided if they hadn't been so goddamn hasty. If they had simply waited a few hours for Ellie and Joel to wake, it's almost certainly what Ellie would've wanted if she had been given the choice) and let her and Joel say their goodbyes, they would've had their vaccine; or at least known one way or the other whether a vaccine was possible. Instead, they practically forced Joel's hand by not giving either of them a choice. Joel wasn't going to let them murder Ellie, and the only way for Ellie to give her consent was to stop the operation, which the Fireflies weren't going to let him do; going so far as to threaten to shoot him if he didn't walk out the door right then and there. Maybe it was malice, maybe it was greed or maybe it was simply desperation

While it's almost certain that Ellie would've chosen to sacrifice herself for a possible vaccine, that's why my Joel walked out of that hospital without a single Firefly still drawing breath.",Spoiler,False,self,t5_2t7gp,False,,

 * Humanity is the passengers of the plane. **Everyone is screaming and yelling** Fear. The emotion that haunts mankind currently.

1373063727.0,1hptns,On the subject of David [spoilers],Possk,70,6,23,"Aight, me thinks you need to sit your ass down and play this clever lil game.

Basically, at least when thrust into a world where common morality is in decay. I do not believe rape was on his agenda initially as everyone else seems to think, however. This is a world where animalistic instinct has taken over. As a trailer quaintly puts, you either hang on to your morals and die--or you do whatever it takes to survive. You've gotta remember that this isn't our world anymore, and societal ethics are practically nonexistent. Let's take a walk through David's shoes for a moment.

His authority as a leader is clearly waning. The further you get through Winter, women and children are dying off in their lil area. The winter's too cruel and too many are perishing. So, when Ellie comes along, a few things that David's desperate for can be answered.

In various social species

Ellie is clearly a survivor--she's intelligent, David will get trapped and you as Ellie need to save his ass or else game over) and adapts fast. Her smarts, strength of ability, and youth would technically make her an ideal 'mate'. Gross by our standards, yes. In their world, where animalistic urges have overcome societal morality, perhaps not. What matters is that David goes through hell to get her on their side, David has gone into pure survival mode. 

Notice how Ellie in general presents trouble for David, the reward's well worth the risk. Many argue that David wanted to rape her purely on sexual lust, which I personally think's incorrect. Nolan says that he felt David didn't want to rape or do anything terrible to Ellie (at first--her pissing him off changes a lotta the playing field). This can have two meanings, depending on perspective. One holds that David simply wasn't interested in her that way and we players are putting too much thought into it. The other of the two lays in David's desire to 'convert' Ellie. Wanting to pull her over to their side despite everything she's putting him through (killing group members, endangering his leadership, etc.). If he were successful, this would not qualify as rape. Converting her and having her bear his children would not necessarily mean something terrible due to the conversion, which David's most certainly adopted

And as alphas go, even though we the players (and obviously Elllie) think it's screwy as all fuck. One of the men Joel tortures says that she's become David's 'new pet', which can mean a lotta things depending on how you look at it. It can either mean he's had other 'pets' before or that he's recently found a 'pet' to have around. I'm more inclined to agree with the latter, but I get why others lean towards the first meaning. Regardless, the notion remains the same. Alphas dominate and generally have the most children, giving further rise to the idea that David wants to re-establish this authority.

Throughout the arc, giving her food and 'negotiating' with her in a way). Think of it as courting if you will, as gross as it sounds. Obviously, it doesn't work. As such, he resorts to the only other way he can establish dominance--violence. A show of ferocity and power, which explains the near deranged behavior he exhibits as he hunts Ellie down. The more he doesn't get his way, the angrier and crazed he gets. Likely he felt killing her and chopping her 'to tiny pieces' would have sufficed as it'd give everyone in the group their way, scary as it was to see. But then you get to the machete. Slashing and bashing her down. Stabbing her through the heart. By the last stage, and it's very obvious that he'll kill without mercy. By this point

Whether he was going to rape Ellie or not by the end is up to speculation, and David by now wants to overpower her by any means necessary. She's a fighter--so he wants to take that away from her. She ""has no idea what [he's] capable of"" in David's own words, and dominance will be achieved in the most awful of fashions.

I tend to see Joel and David as foil characters. Joel believes in luck and how ""it will run out"", caring relationship with her as they've grown together on their journey after a rocky beginning. David has a much darker, much less human relationship with Ellie as it progresses after what seemed like a friendly beginning. Joel's the father in Ellie's life while David was intended to be the pursuer--one of sexual intent like you would a boyfriend of some sort. A very twisted, very creepy boyfriend that you'd kick outta your house and threaten to shoot on sight.

Anyways, throughout the game Ellie is a symbol of hope--for Joel, for humanity, etc.). Just like everything in the game, there's a lot more to his character than the simple 'black-white' morality. In a twisted, purely animal perspective, David's behavior is logical, any humanity left in David disappears altogether as he quite literally becomes an animal. He represents the darkest side of humanity and what it can become if left unchecked

Joel's supporters have proposed that the FF's cure effort was highly flawed and unlikely to succeed, and somewhat sound like sour grapes.

All you have to do is consider the role of the father that Joel takes on.

The role is not a selfish one. It's also, I too started wondering why he was willing to toss aside any chance of developing a cure for humanity in order to save Ellie. But I have a 12 year old daughter, so I didn't have to wonder for very long.

I think the greatest significance of Sarah to the story may be that Joel doesn't have to become a father through Ellie. He already is a father. He already knows the role, and ultimately you could argue that the **obligation** it brings - to protect her even the cost of saving humanity - is the price he pays for having given in.",,True,nsfw,t5_2t7gp,False,,

Marlene had watched her entire army die. Marlene had withstood 20 years of being a rebel while in search of a cure or vaccine. If one is to read Marlene's diary then it is clear that this burden has weighed on her. Marlene was no longer searching for a cure or a vaccine. I state this because her diary makes it perfectly clear that her motivation was to make sure her comrades did not die in vain. Marlene was willing to go to any lenght necessary to make sure this happens and this was her flaw.

I snuck by all the soldiers and went through the hospital completely undetected. when it came to the stair soldier and end soldiers

When I got into the operating room and I saw the surgeon pointing the scalpel at me

Now here is the real interesting part. The female doctor says ""no... you fucking animal."" She never says ""You KILLED him"". Personally to me, but the game logic implanted in our heads say we have to shoot him in the head, some even killed all three docs! One more thing I noticed, [after I shot the doc in the kneecap, He didn't have the death blood pool, there was only the splatter of blood from me shooting his knee.](/spoiler)

This changes everything. Based on my assumptions. It's perfectly doable for you to save Ellie without killing any innocent people. Joel is also extremely pragmatic. His one goal is to save Ellie, Ellie dies too so he'd definitely pick the stealth option. Of course you still kill Marlene and the soldier at the start; but she posed a direct threat to Ellie since she is the only one that knows Joel and Ellie.

1372556765.0,1hcbv2,"""I struggled for a long time with surviving."" Analyzing Joel's character. [SPOILERS]",thekidwiththefa,66,11,40,"So, which was stunningly well-written.

The ending leaves you with a pretty terrifying image of him: here's this guy who's terrified of having nothing to live for, which was surprising enough in itself since I very rarely see video game characters written like that.

The line in the title sums it up. He says it to Ellie near the end, but some things in the game make me think that this is how Joel's *always* been, even before he lost Sarah.

I went back and watched the prologue again, but both of them get to the root of Joel's conflict. The practical interpretation, that if Joel loses his job he won't be able to support Sarah or have a roof over his head, and the existential one, that having responsibilities gives his life a purpose, both point to Joel as someone who feels a bit insecure or shaky about whether his life has value. As the rest of the game shows, he seems to judge it entirely by whether it has a clear purpose. It's not until he starts getting closer to Ellie and protecting her that he becomes more driven, deep down.

Another part of the prologue is Joel shooting their neighbor Jimmy, that side that will kill to protect what he cares about.

The last part of the prologue is Joel carrying Sarah out of town after their truck crashes, and equating it to him rescuing Sarah implies that he felt this with her too.

I do want to clarify that I don't think Joel was at the same *level* of monstrosity at the beginning as he is at the end. Certainly the trauma of losing his daughter and living through hell for 20 years eroded a lot of his humanity, and even sadder, he seems to take Ellie with him.

4. Joel does a shitty job of lying to her in the car

As we've seen throughout the game

The point of the last cutscene is that Ellie has survivor's guilt from everything that she's gone through and is asking Joel if they did the right thing by not sacrificing her to *maybe* get a cure. The chance of even getting a cure out of her is slim

If she didn't suspect that she wasn't going to live before they got to the hospital, his ""we don't talk about the past"" rule. Ellie finally does tell a story about her past that Joel listens to, and then he swears the story about the Fireflies was true. Ellie knows Joel is lying, and Joel knows that she knows. It's his round about way of telling her that he cares about her and they made the right decision

Here's the problem (and, I am completely on board with ignoring this issue in order to create the amazing ending they did), either her infection proceeded down a different route because of something to do with Ellie's biology OR it proceeded due to the mutation of the spores that infected her.  If it's the former, then biopsying her brain will tell them next to nothing about creating a vaccine and if it's the latter, then the vaccine is literally swimming in her blood stream and the 'creation' involves a blood draw and an array of fungal cultures..or shit, just have Ellie bite people.

***
**Pre-Stage 1:**

Any living human that is infected yet still in control of there brain is considered pre-stage 1. This occurs after a living human intakes the cordyceps fungus through inhaling spores or bodily fluid exchange, seen in main character Ellie. Infected humans are in pre-stage 1 from the point of infection until 1-2 days in.
***
**Stage 1:**

Stage one starts the moment the cordyceps takes over the infected humans brain. Referred to by survivors as runners
***
**Stage 2:**

Stage 2 of infection, but not enough to harm there senses anymore than that of a runner. Stalkers are far more intelligent than runners, and have a very keen sense of their surroundings. Stalkers will attempt to hide behind cover and ambush survivors. When running from place to place they will strafe. Stalkers are slightly stronger than runners.
***
**Stage 3:**

Stage 3 of infection begins the moment that an infected human's fungal growths disable its eyesight, however their echolocation provides them with the ability to still sense where a human might be. Provoked clickers will rapidly flail their arms while walking towards the area where they last heard the human. Clickers are slower than runners, however they are stronger. The fungal growths on a clicker's face can act as weak armor.
***
**Stage 4:**

Stage 4 begins when an infected human's fungal growths reach all parts of it's body. Referred to by survivors as bloaters, however their echolocation is far worse compared to clickers. Bloaters throw balls of spores from their own body at their targets. They are extremely strong, however their speed is much worse than previous stage of infection. Fire can burn through a bloaters fungal armor, making it more vulnerable.
***
**Post-Death:**

When the fungus decides that the infected human is no longer capable of efficiently spreading the infection through body fluid exchange; due to high body damage (which can be caused by the fungus itself), where it will then proceed with releasing infectious spores into the air, so that any human that enters said area without protection (usually via gas mask) will be infected. Infected that have been killed by any means other than the fungus doing it itself will not release spores into the air.",Spoiler,False,self,t5_2t7gp,spoiler,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1jts37/stages_of_infection_possible_spoilers/
1374968687.0,1j6s8a,Survivor Tips and Tricks compendium [Spoilers],Beignet,50,1,14,"I just completed a survivor run

**GENERAL**

- Stealthing will be very important both because it's a resource-less way to kill

- Stretch out your melee weapons by preceeding with bottle or brick stun. If it stuns

- You can sneak up on most moving human enemies with your default speed (standing

- A health upgrade (with the pills) is a free heal

- On that note, and in my opinion trumps a health upgrade. 

- Don't be in a hurry to heal if you find yourself low after just finishing a fight. Ellie and your companions will give you health packs if you don't have any

- There are at least 3 fully made shivs that you can pick up. 1)  DO NOT MISS THESE. On route to Robert, and you at the docks with a ton of people. It's on one of the boxes. 3) Downtown, in the area with the clickers after you come across the Fireflies and your first Molotov. It's in a locker immediately to your left.

- You can safely move a human enemy that you snuck up on (but haven't killed yet). I will usually move them behind cover

- General runner strategy: an area full of runners isn't too bad. All the areas where you'll be overwhelmed by runners are rather large, throw them, and pick them off one by one this way. 

- Regarding weapon upgrades

- Take advantage of companion invincibility, it's far safer. 

- Shiv doors. You can skip the first one, where there is a manual inside. Also, that being said, never make nail bombs. 

- Hunters that use molotovs all wear the same red jacket for some strange reason. On survivor

- When sneaking through an area, you can take a breather. 

- If you are within sights or just in the vicinity of a human enemy, it'll be unmistakable afterwards. This is your cue to take cover before they realize what they've seen. If you are far enough, they won't take action. The game gives you a different cue if you've been seen, usually in the form of bullets or runners. 

- A stunned enemy stays stunned for about 5 seconds. 
 
- Enemy routes are constant unless you disturb them, etc. Use this to formulate your own strategies and routes. 

- Joel will easily win in fisticuffs against a runner or stalker, better to wait for the runner to make his move, whilst moving backwards or to the side, and follow up.

**AREA SPECIFIC**

- Downtown, there are two small health packs, and you can also practice killing lone clickers with bricks.  

- Downtown, and kill the clicker with the revolver. That's two. It'll take 4 body shots or 2 head shots, but that's harder with weapon sway. Empty the rest into the next runner that comes at you, stun with a brick and switch guns if you go empty. That's three. It's just runners (two more) left, so make circles and pick them off. Don't forget the revolver ammo by the guard in the upper area. 

- Downtown, especially if you want the safe. It's just parts but I think it's well worth it. If not, cut through the middle, and make your way to where you have to pull the ladder down. Don't waste a shiv on the clicker, keep a bottle with you. Here's a tricky part, if you throw it too far away you might not wake it up, but if you throw it too close you can't clear enough time to pull down the ladder. Throw the bottle just far enough to wake it up

- Museum fight: Where you come up on Tess fighting off the runner, but try to let Tess handle most of it. 

- On route to Bill, and boost Ellie over, before attempting to get it. Throw a brick to get it out of the shed, and get in and get out.  

- On route to Bill, and to make sure you don't waste the shiny new upgraded melee you find, use a bottle and press triangle to grab it instead. There's some pills here. 

- Making your way to the school, I always assumed I did something wrong, but just be prepared for this. After you over the bus where you have to boost Ellie up to get the ladder, immediately make for the window. Waiting for Bill to open it risks damage. 

- First bloater fight: a lot of people seem to have problem with this. Waste the two runners that come up at you on the left with the shotgun, I think this is just too easy of a fight to waste them. They're better served at the basement hotel (if that) to help you make your getaway. 

- Hotel basement. Immediately make your way to the office

- Financial district, near the gate where you'll progress, because enemies are more likely to come through the bottleneck, and not up top. Try to have some notion of the number left, and make sure you pick up any ammo, arrows, or items as a result of the fight, along with all the goodies. 

- University

- Ellie's section, try to kill them inside - can't get ammo drops if they're outside. If you get hit in the first wave, restart, but if you get hit in the second wave, just let them kill you (as morbid as that sounds), because a restart will set you back to the beginning. The waves are marked by David blocking off the left set of windows. In the hallway right after that section, STAY TO THE LEFT. Runners will break the windows on the right and you could lose health. 

- Ellie's section

- Ellie's section, use a single one, as there is one arrow on the table in the upper level. If you are having trouble with the runners, they drop from the windows above, so pick one and place a nail bomb under. Cycle through each of the rest, and make circles around the area if you get overwhelmed. If you were saving a molotov for the bloater, wait for it to drop down to the main level

- Ellie's section, which is just about enough to take out everyone in the area immediately after falling off Callus (R.I.P).

- David fight. I was seriously not looking forward to this, you can get them within 10-15 seconds of each other if you wanted. The third is a bitch. Just try your best to not get seen, and move slowly, all you want to know is where he is. I can't confirm it yet, but if you see the direction he takes to move to new cover, he doesn't look behind him once he settles, so that's your way in. It's worked well on hard, and my recent survivor run.

- Salt Lake City, that would be the weapon of choice in this section. There is another ammo cartrige between the first and second section, and the first bloater also drops ammo for it.  

- Firefly lab. If you've been diligent about your ammo and item usage you can absolutely waste everyone here. If you really want to sneak I'll defer to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMQDcAUSMMc. Credit to the maker of the video.

Hi everyone

It is all too easy to say that Joel sees   Ellie as a replacement daughter
I have heard it said that Joel doesn't think that mankind is worth saving, he is obviously still suffering with Sarah's loss, and emotionally redundant to the world. But as he spends more time with Ellie, he finds his compassion for humanity through her. The way I see it, Joel did what he did because he believes that the people that would be saved through Ellie's death would not be worthy of such sacrifice, whereas the person dying (Ellie) is the kind of person that the future needs for the human race to amend and prosper. There is also the fact that Joel has reason to distrust collectives of people: whether they be hunters, the Fireflies, or the infected. In his experience, they only care about the other people within their own collectives. 
So, like Tess or Bill, and to a greater extent, to Ellie and to himself. I really believe that Joel feels that by saving Ellie, in a small way, he is still saving the world. A slither of light in the darkness still shines brightly. 
I also think that the lie at the end that he tells her about the Fireflies is said for her own sake. Ellie grew up with the people in this organisation, to keep her hope and faith in humanity intact. But I also think that Ellie was implicit in this lie. The very reason that she asks it is to hear the 'correct' answer. Her question is already leading him to swear the truth before asking him which truths to swear. 
So to surmise my statement,Spoiler,False,self,t5_2t7gp,False,spoiler,True

Some backstory first:
I've been counting the days since The Last of Us was first announced. I got this masterpiece about 2 weeks ago and I loved every second of it. But one thing bothered me. The first E3 demo kind of gave me the feeling that killing an enemy AI would feel weighty (in the emotional sense). My first play through was on Hard, and then I'll stealth the Hotel."" I was perplexed at how caught up I was on Joel and Ellie that I forgot about the hunters and bandits. And by then, killing a hunter or bandit was like winning a game of chess. I felt happy going on slaughter fests on these guys (stealthily though).

Then on my third play through on Survivor +........ something special happened.

So

One of them was what I called a ""Pyrotechnic enemy"" (the one's that hold Molotov's and are red) was talking about getting some power for there projector to watch a movie and it's been forever since that happened. The other ""enemy"" responded "" Ain't nobody got time for that!"" (something like that). They go there separate ways and I strangled the Pyrotechnic. That was the first ""enemy"" I ever felt bad for killing. It got to me, just trying to live the life we could have lived if it wasn't for this godforsaken apocalypse. To me he wasn't that different from Ellie. 

So I went to the second floor, Ellie said "" Why is she so thin? "" I looked at the image of a model. Joel said ""For looks."" Ellie responds ""Thats dumb/stupid.""

That's when I knew the game was truly special. My moral goals were so confused. I just killed someone that could have been me (the player), and who can perish in a world like this. I walk around a bit pondering, and then Ellie says ""Why don't we lighten the mood a bit"". She gets out a joke book. Initially the jokes were really silly. The last one got to me. ""What did the mermaid where to school""......."" An algae bra!"". Joel, Ellie, and myself laugh simultaneously! I never had such a reassuring feeling in my gaming life ever. I really felt a true connection with them, just like friends, it took me 3 play throughs to realize this. This feeling is what I wanted for the past 2 and a half years! A feeling that was truly unique

Then it hit me. This masterpiece simulated a real life situation. I felt terrible at what I did

So many feels. I didn't need the ending to make me miss Joel and Ellie. All I needed was everything in between. Those small details like an ""enemy"" talking to a fellow ""enemy""

Naughty Dog truly deserves to be praised for what they've done here.

Note: I say ""enemy"" in quotations cause I'm being sarcastic.
Sorry for such a long post. I really got into the mood. 
UPDATE: This post is in loving memory of Pyro-Movie-Man
UPDATE 2: Special Thanks to xcorinthiax for correcting my hyphen~quote  mistake. :)

I've also seen people complaining about Listen mode and the flamethrower.

Listen mode can easily be toggled on/off yet people still complain about it. People complain about the Flamethrower and say that it's OP. You don't even have to pick it up or use it. The Flamethrower ammo is pretty rare and runs out fast.

Because of the 4th of July weekend, and uncle were visiting my family in Minnesota from Colorado. Instead of playing board games and that sort of thing with them I went to my basement and continued my second play through, starting at the scene where you meet Sam and Henry. Anyways, my cousin came down stairs and started watching with me. Now, after a while I could tell he was very interested. He would ask questions and react to occurrences such as infected attacks. Well naturally, my aunt and uncle came to check on us, which by that time I had reached the sniper duel. 

But get this, fall, and all the way to the start of winter. Eventually, it was pretty late and we had to go to bed, but my cousin said ""you better tell me when you're playing tomorrow so I can watch"". My aunt, after refusing to tell her how it ended, went online to see the ending (bad idea I know).

I'm not even halfway through

(All of the below applies to Normal mode only)

- Bricks are your friends. You can both throw them as a distraction and bash someone's head in quickly. If you do this out of sight of other enemies it can be a stealth kill

- If you're carrying a brick or bottle you can toss it at an enemy by hitting R1 when a green circle appears over them. This will stun them temporarily

- Fire + Clickers = good. Best way to kill large groups of them is to get them in one place by throwing something else them lighting them up with a Molotov. The sound of the Molotov breaking will also draw nearby Clickers

- While we're on the subject

- You can reliably take out two Runners with a melee weapon, take out the third with a headshot and then let the two remaining come to you. Just make sure you get the first swing in or you might be in trouble.

- Pushing an enemy against an object in the middle of a four-hit melee kill will result in an instant death animation where Joel will bash the unfortunate victim's head in. This works with walls as well as horizontal surfaces and will dramatically shorten a fight. 

- This game has a high degree of weapon sway, some enemies can survive multiple gunshots to the head. The ""crown"" of fungus on a Clicker seems to act as a kind of armour, as on multiple occasions I've ended up just shooting off the fungus instead of of killing the Clicker.

- Save your upgrade parts for your weapons holsters first. These allow you to carry multiple weapons without needing to get into your backpack. Later on you'll encounter multiple powerful guns and you'll be kicking yourself if you have to leave one behind.

1372449640.0,1h9p7z,[Spoilers] Let's Talk about Joel's decision,CockasaurusRex32,52,9,44,"Okay

Now the decision we are discussing here is whether to give up Ellie and allow her to die in order to ""Save humanity""

First

Creating a cure:  Creating a vaccine for the virus/fungus with the state of the world they're in is nearly impossible.  I'm being generous saying ""nearly"", but experienced scientists.  The most important thing they seem to lack, however is Time.  The fireflies are the only ones left even trying to develop a cure at all.  More and more of them are dying every day.  They are running low on resources and according to some of Marlene's logs... fighting a bit among themselves out of frustration.  Developing a vaccine takes a lot of time, a lot of tests, a lot of resources.  

But, meaning they give it to whoever the fuck they want.  This probably does not include the vast amounts of people living outside of the quarantine zones: IE Hunters.  Hunters seem to be in somewhat large numbers in most cities, especially larger cities.  They also seem to have a problem with military authority.  

But again, they seem to be more interested in killing and eating you rather than just infecting you.  They also seem to be impervious to the passage of time… and possibly even growing stronger for it.  So you can’t exactly wait them out.  The military, already struggling with lack of supplies and resources, will eventually have to try and retake some ground… especially now that the population is hopefully increasing again.  But taking more ground requires the resources to 1) purge it of infected and 2) keep it safe.  And not just defend it from clickers, but the people as well.  Hungry citizens under martial law tend to revolt.  (You have seen this in the game too, in the city that Joel and Ellie meet Henry and Sam.  There are messages all over the walls from citizens revolting as well as dead military in the streets)

So as you can see

Let’s get back to Joel’s decision.  Even if Joel doesn’t know the full extent of what it would take to find a cure, has developed a deep bond with Ellie.  Throughout the majority of the game, Joel seems to view Ellie as a burden and pushes her away emotionally.  However, I personally think he pushes her away because he is afraid about caring for her.  It’s clear she reminds him of his daughter, whom he already lost.  He still struggles with her memory and with loss in general throughout the game.  By the end of the game, when he finally let’s his emotional wall down and allows Ellie in, I think he realizes that losing her would destroy him.  So while his choice may seem selfish

At the same time, I think she is so willing to accept Joel’s lie because she feels like she’s finally found that person and it’s worth more to her than saving humanity.  She doesn’t need a grand quest to give meaning to her life anymore because now she has Joel and he gives meaning to her life.

This turned out to be a fairly long post.  Keep in mind

I just wanted to ask, watching this podcast from IGN, as well as Rev3's podcast, I find that MANY people find Joel to be a ""bad guy"" and we are ""playing as the bad guy""... I do not know that I feel that way.

The more I think about it, at the least)... so the follow up question is, do you ASK someone into martyrdom, can you ASK someone to take that responsibility?  Is it even fair to ask that question to someone?


The humanity we experience in this game is a disgusting species, in that situation.. ""do i save what good i know does exist, or make sure the evil i know exists lives on a bit longer?"" its not at all an insult to the species, just the version of it present in that time. Is there any going back? would using her as a guinea pig or a christ save anything? Is it even worth it to ask that question? My perspective is, Joel was absolutely justified in his rampage through the hospital, but its fascinating to see people experiencing those emotions of the final minutes of the game in their own way, but... I see a predominant amount of critics and media espousing him as Evil..

I just dont think I see it that way.   I think they leave Joel's motivations very, my perspective of what Joel was thinking was that you cannot force or ask someone into martydom. That is an unfair burden to task any person with.

This may be a case of projection, of all the fantastic things in this game, is Naughty Dog left Joel's motivations somewhat shrouded in mystery.  He may be our main character, may be the character with damn near the most lines over this 15 hour long adventure, but, I think they leave him somewhat, fantastically, but thats not the way I interpreted this story (which makes it exciting so many people felt different ways)

* Survivors with healthy/hungry/sick is just a fancy way of showing you your level. As long as you keep survivors through the day (1 week = 7 matches or ""days""), but the rewards for survivors are purely cosmetical.

* Parts are things earned through what you do in a match and are accumulated toward earning new weapons and better survival skills. You don'y have to be good at killing people to earn parts; you can earn LOTS of parts simply by choosing the support class and healing others (although this is so goddamn easy I think they're probably going to patch this soon). You also earn parts by crafting things! So even if you don't *need* that medkit

* SPEND YOUR GODDAMN PARTS. You do NOT lose them at the end of a match; everything you earn *and* spend is accumulated at the end of a match and distributed among your survivors. THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. Too many times have I seen someone running around without any ammo when they can just *open their backpack and BUY some.* Buy the armor
  
* Mark your enemies! You earn parts
  
* YES your odds of survival are increased when you stick together
  
* STOP RUNNING EVERYWHERE GODDAMN IT. Unless the match has just started or you know for a fact the enemy is on the other side of the map

I know I probably missed some, and nobody else. Teams won't be the same between matches, it doesn't matter who's chosen Firefly and Hunters, they're mixed up and the result is shown to you disguised as the same faction. I also HIGHLY recommend the hilarity of connecting the game to Facebook. It doesn't post ANYTHING to your wall, and instead gives all of the survivors names from your Friends List.

Most people who have played the last of us enjoyed playing winter more than any other part of the game. This was largely because you finally get to play as Ellie. And before I go any further

However, and is extremely capable, she is still a kid. 

At the end of Fall (when Joel falls off the horse), ""tell me what to do. Get up Joel!"" We already know Joel is the only person she has left, and clearly views him as a father.

During winter, they seem to be trying to make her appear more vulnerable. 

Ellie manages to kill David all by herself, rushes in to the steakhouse to find her smashing David's face in with a machete. Ellie has broken down by this point, not even recognizing Joel untill she sees his face. Then she just looses and says, ""he tried to-"". She cries into Joel's shoulder. Joel leads her out of the burning building with his arm around her shoulder, holding her close to him.

In spite of being a complete badass, while Ellie gave Joel some level of humanity that he lost when Sarah died in his arms 20 years ago.

If either one of them lost the other, the father who would give up anything to save his baby girl, I'm talking about the ruthless killer who murdered countless innocents over the past 20 years.

1374737716.0,1j0jvh,Why Joel will never tell Ellie the truth. [Ending spoilers],HikariOni,48,11,41,"When talking about a sequel

Joel dies, and tells her what really happened. Ellie then goes on a search to find the remaining Fireflies in order to make a cure, because she doesn't have anything to lose anymore.

I think that, and second it will never ever happen.

First reason why this won't happen

Now for an in-game perspective

Joel will never ever confess to Ellie. Ever. The reason for that is simple: he wants what every parent in the world wants: for their children to live a long and fulfilling life

She could never be happy after hearing the truth, and that nobody should take that from her. He told her that she mattered, and that he wasn't going to leave her. He took the responsibility of her life, and, in a way, of mankind, by deciding that she should not die for a vaccine. But if he told her the truth, and she doesn't want that. For Joel

He won't tell her the truth because he knows that if he does, too selfless for her own good, that she would do that. And she would also do it because of her survivor's guilt, that makes her feel like she owes it to the world, to the people who died from being infected. Joel doesn't want that. He wants her to live, because he knows she deserves it even if she may think that she doesn't.

Also, after all she's been through. And I think, as /u/keftih has pointed out in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1hk6c1/spoilers_mega_discussion_animal_symbolism_the/), that Ellie has indeed lost her faith in humanity, but that her guilt makes her still want to save it, just so it would be off her shoulders. Joel would never put all that weight back on her, because even though it's clear for him

I've also seen people point out that Joel would feel guilty for killing the Fireflies and Marlene

To the people who think that

Joel is not just any person that would feel guilty about killing people. He is a hardened survivor. Killing to survive is part of his life. And if he hadn't killed all those people

Besides, the decision every parent would've made without a second of hesitation. He wasn't going to let anyone, for any reason, kill his baby girl. Ever. There is not a shadow of a doubt in his mind that what he did was the right thing to do. Yes it may have been selfish. Yes it may have destroyed a chance for a vaccine to fight the infection. But all those things don't matter. All that matters is Ellie's life, and that was preserved. 

There is no question on that. His decision is made, and that is for the best, because thanks to it, they can live a relatively peaceful and happy life.

Nothing could make him go back on his decision

Playing through the game

The game did an amazing job at replicating what Joel would feel to the players. I was getting tired of surviving

I was saving her from running off

Joel's quote ""No matter what... You keep finding something to fight for"" struck out the most at me at the end. 

Basically, but that wore out soon enough. By the time I was at the hydroelectric plant, I didn't want to play anymore. Then the game showed the first sign that Joel actually caring about Ellie, and I kept going. And it wasn't about getting to the destination that kept me going, it was about keeping Ellie safe.

So, looking at it as objectively as I can from every angle. I feel like I need to; a lot of talk has surrounded this game, with plenty of cries of 'overrated!' I just want to show people that it is not overrated. At all. 

The game is, and vice versa. And there are just enough of both of these, too; there was never a moment in the entire three playthroughs I’ve already completed where I got truly bored of the gameplay (as I did with Heavy Rain) or tired of cutscenes (as is the case with MGS4). 

Moments of intense action survival are contrasted brilliantly with calm and quiet segments of peaceful exploratory gameplay. For every dark and dank area in the game, riding around on horseback is serene and peaceful. This lends the game a brilliant duality; it is both exciting, like Bioshock Infinite or Devil May Cry, and yet it has elements of serenity equalling the soaring beauty of Journey or Limbo. 

There are also sections of this game that are completely isolated and serve as a brilliant device for keeping the player invested and focused. Joel hanging upside-down as the infected run screaming toward him is just one example of this – think of any other triple-A game. They would re-use that gimmick unashamedly in order to pad the run-time of the game. However

Joel and Ellie are two sides of the same coin; both survivors, and outlook. While Ellie is innocent (her love of comics and whistling is evidence of this) and carefree (something Henry picks up on by saying “She doesn’t seem bothered by... any of this,”) Joel is the complete opposite. He is very cynical; his reply of “how the hell would I know?” to Ellie’s hopeful question about two lovers only heard of through a note shows this. He also completely lacks innocence; the fact that he so casually tortures Robert and has clearly done similar things before shows this. Therefore these two characters are excellent foils for one another, and represent the duality of human nature. As a whole, they perfectly balance the game’s story between being hopeless and hopeful. More character analysis in later parts. 

 In the Ancient Greek world

Naughty Dog’s understanding of how the PS3 works is key to their incredible success with The Last of Us. I only noticed halfway through the game

Naughty Dog has also with this game made one of the best examples of video games as an art form. The storytelling is on par with or better than the majority of movies I’ve seen

Likewise, she is hurt but not ruined by the world in which the protagonists live. Coincidence? I think not. I’ll elaborate on this and talk Joel in later parts. 

The gameplay contributes to this as well. While Telltale’s The Walking Dead fixes the issue of what to do with gameplay by almost completely removing it, and reflects the story: for example (Winter spoilers ahead) playing as Ellie alone in the snowstorm with minimal equipment and supplies mirrors perfectly how deserted and isolated she is when Joel is out of the picture, being grievously wounded. It is also an accurate depiction of Ellie’s emotional state at this point in the game; she is at her darkest moment, hounded by hunters and fearful that Joel might die. The incredibly severe weather is representative of this, as well as the chillingly isolating gameplay; note that there are no hints given in these sections, and there is no ally to give helpful tips. Ellie is alone and frightened in a painful world.

On its shallowest level, Joel is not a hero. he saved Ellie because he needed her for his own selfish reasons, which was showcased by him lying to Ellie twice. Joel doesn't want Ellie to have the option of making the choice to sacrifice herself for the good of mankind because that would leave him with nothing to survive for... This is the character who I was controlling for almost the entire game; a character I cheered for and whose pain I felt when shot or punched, and after he did what he did, I was left feeling just as ashamed as I assumed he did.

1376473328.0,1kc83d,"Tips, Tactics, and Helpful Information: How do you survive Survivor Mode?",binauralshitsound,36,22, and am a much more capable player than I was on Normal. You adapt to and learn lot of stuff to get through Survivor

Best pieces of advice I can offer:

* In all the sections of the game where you're playing as Joel with Ellie's help, and have none in your inventory as well as no materials to make them, Ellie will give you one at critical times. So make a ton of Molotovs. 

* Use ammo to get ammo. You'll find a lot more ammunition on corpses that you made in firefights than with stealth

* On Survivor, they have the advantage on you if you're noticed, but you have an edge up on them if you open up with gunfire from afar. Especially in the Sewers with Sam, you'll just frustrate yourself trying to act Splinter Cell. Remember, they don't have guns. Generally, stealth is a much better tactic against normal human enemies. 

* Consolidate what you have in your inventory. Too many times I kept dying because I was locked into a certain tactic, which is a massive help when well-placed. 

* Even when a fight seems hopeless, an empty inventory, don't fall into that nasty gamer loop of frustrated deaths. Take a deep breath and try something else. Even if you're certain you can pull it off the way you've been failing, just try something else. This game is very good about giving you serious room to run different plays against its many scenarios. Use that freedom. I've pulled off shit in Survivor that I couldn't believe worked, things I was basically just trying because I was tired of seeing the same death so many times. No matter how dumb something might seem, it's better than what's been getting you killed for the past half-hour. 

* I don't want to promote metagaming, try and remember what comes after the immediate fight. I wasted all my supplies near the end of Pittsburgh, things I could have really used in the Sewers. Most of the time you'll find that all you needed to get through that next batch of enemies is Joel's hands, and that the supplies you saved make all the difference later. Be utterly minimalistic whenever you can afford it. Using a bomb or a Molotov because you have an entertaining opportunity to won't help you when you really, really need one to get through an area. 

* Ellie is far from useless. This took me a while to really learn to utilize since I'm so used to useless NPCs, or if she has a good position on an enemy for a Switchblade kill, work with it. She's killed enemies before while I was sitting there thinking about how to best approach them. Always take her into consideration when you have her, because she's a big, big help. 

* Your Shivs are more valuable than anything else on Survivor for the Shiv Doors. Even if you've already opened them all and aren't worried about the Trophy anymore, or if you can beat them without stealth, do it. Think of them as keys to ammo caches that become useless or disappear when used as Shivs. 

* Sprinting around like a madman can form a tidy mob of infected behind you. In open enough areas, so you'll come out with more than what you had going in. 

That's about all I can compile. I doubt any of it is unknown or original,False,self,t5_2t7gp,False,,,t3_1kc83d

 I understand that people who don't own a PS3 that were interested in the game saw it on youtube because they had no other way, but by actually playing the game yourself. This is true for most games, but The Last of Us in particular. I know I'd get bored of watching some guy throw bricks and bottles around while hiding behind cover for 10 hours, but when you're the one crouch walking away from clickers in pitch darkness, it's a totally different experience.

The best examples of this are moments when you, or when you're carrying Ellie while running through the hospital at the end of the game. These small sequences are what makes The Last of Us only work as a game and not a film. Sure it's still exciting to watch, but when you have the controller in your hand, it's sensational.

1372623072.0,1hdr82,[Spoilers] [Feels] What TLoU taught us,Annegato,43,11,43,"Hi everyone, silently stalked subreddit since. So many interesting thoughts and views; I really want to thank everyone for contributing here.  

I guess what's prompting me is the fact that I've seen many ""Team Joel""/""Team Fireflies"" posts, etc. and I thought I'd try to synthesize what I've read. 

Part of what made the game breathtaking was that **if the developers of The Last of Us wanted to make a game in which they cleanly cut bite-sized pieces of trauma, and then arrange those on a black-and-white plate, then that game would definitely not be The Last of Us.** This game was not shoot-and-dismiss. This game was as frustrating for my mind as it was for my heart. It challenged my initial reaction. 

Joel and Ellie aren't exactly like a parent and a child, but after what Sam said... it gets creepy. And yes, vaccines and cures might be hard to achieve or distribute, but then again, we don't know all the details, and the details we do know provide confidence to people in charge so... who knows? And while we're playing as Joel, even Joel isn't entirely like the person he used to be, well

**I'm proud to say that I really don't know what I would do if I were those characters.** The important thing is that I understand the characters, ""Hah, it's so simple, I know how that would all go down for me!"" 

I don't mean to attack the wonderfully strong opinions. I too, have sympathy for Joel, but I really don't think he was healthy. I too, think that the Trolley Problem tricks Ph.D's and gamers alike into hypocrisy, and yes, maybe it is more sensible for us to sacrifice one to save the many, but the fact that we give inconsistent responses to the Trolley Problem when it is rephrased shows how gray it is. And I too think that Marlene made a very difficult and infuriating decision. But I think instead of ""Fuck Marlene! Kill that bitch!"" we might say ""Wow. I am so sorry for her; she cared a lot for Ellie, whether she chooses to sacrifice Ellie or not."" 

I too, in the end, we kind of know, because... well... she kind of knows... *kind of.*

I'm not angry at Joel. I don't like him, or between a smiling family photograph and the red marks of ""Forgive us.""

Anyway, because you've helped me come to these thoughts. And I'm glad because I have more perspective now. I could imagine myself in the shoes of the people who might be affected by Joel's actions or Marlene's actions for years to come. Maybe in the shoes of Bill and his growing isolation and growing inability to relate to others, or perhaps in David, just, knowing how much you hate his fucking guts, and then, admittedly, to make him who he is now (thanks u/RazakelApollyon and u/GobShite_ !) 

I could go on for another hundred pages about the incredible subtleties and the consistency and the music and the character design and the strong female characters and POC's

**TL;DR 1\. I judge people a lot fucking less now

What a great gift. Sorry for ranting
