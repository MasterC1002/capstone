3) Nas (The rapper who I feel to be most like a poet; he doesn't rap
4) Kendrick Lamar (Might get some hate for this one but I considered him being in the top 3. He has countless flows, I guarantee you'll find references that you never would have caught otherwise)
5) Biggie (no explanation needed)

If you're interested, and I have beats available on my soundcloud account (link below) so you can hear what I'm like. Feel free to show me what you've got over these beats, as well.

my passion everlastin 7

I keep my music blastin 7

old school pirates

what the fuck just happened 6

man this fucking smoke 5

still rappin tight

I had to make a plan or i'd end up being broke 13

Im a poet and I know it 8

So fuck it

ride it like it's stolen 6

bentley keep it flowing 6

pencil and the pen

so if you ever ask

my friends give me hope though

they tell me you cant choke bro

it's us and your city that your keeping so hopeful

so I tell em back Ima kill it with my rap

all I need is a swisher sweet five pack

a fat fucking sack

and they have all that shit so they smile back glad

soon we wont think bout the shit we never had

screaming out riches

as I lift my cigarette

NEW

self preperation I plan to represent

for the youth of my nation aint that evident

I can't let you end up like I

making quick drops out my car to get by

all you need to do is hold your head up high

and yours dreams will go through the clouds

with the success of one

listen

and I cant tell you how to live

but dont give up on the right path

think about your mom

now look at your life and tell me how the fuck your livin

are you happy, are you mad

the only reason that I ask is because im not glad

think about my future all the shit I could of had 

and i dont have it buts thats okay

as im sittin waiting for the day my tape will play

thinking to myself is my time coming

just in case

always look ahead you will not see me running

face my own struggle like a man

pencil and the paper looks like I have a plan

now all I need is for you to comprehend

the fact I will always be here I will take it to the end

never will I let down my own self esteem

especially on the mic I must represent my team

and they all support me they say bentley do your thing

take it to the top till they call you fucking king

even up in heaven you can make the angels sing

and I lOve them all them all to death I will see them in the grave

they dont understand it's my life that they save

and that's the truth

everything I said one hundred percent true

NEW


my life is a problem

people said solve um

but I couldnt stop um

but I couldnt stop um

so im sittin back

wonderin where's life at

hydroplonic super sonic

waste my ambition on a quartersack

but those are just the mistakes of my lifetime

trying to get the right mind

get the mic and spit rhyme all the time

yo

and my only happiness came from chillin with my crew

im so lonely inside but nobody has a clue

and to be frankt with you

should I just quit? Should I just quit?

walk outside

everytime I rap

but I gotta ask is it even worth it?

NEW

Since ninety four I've always been a step behind

by the age of sixteen I never found my shine

started feeling down never thought that I could climb

these are the hardships of the troubles in my mind

even my mom noticed she had her suspicion

few days later I had my doctors perscription

I thought I was good

wake up

Usually I keep all these private, thanks for your time if you did end up reading them.",,False,,t5_2qhas,1352336489.0,,

And then it ended without a word

Well

""KEEP IT G BRUH 

'Keep it G' is song SGP produced for Rocky off of LiveLoveASAP. It's a direct shot at SGP for whatever reason. I don't really know.

If you look at SGP's twitter

""Yo i got love for both raider klan and asap fans i love yall but that nigga a hoe bruh a lil ass boy mynigga fuck that nigga man RIP JITT""

""Niggas know where half of his steez come from then he wanna act like he a real nigga bruh stop sneak dissing mynigga come to miami""

ETC.

Personally, I'm a RXIDXR all the way, and another thing, SGP brings up a good point (also, an elephant in the room): 

""2010 Before : http://youtu.be/b_nDzu0uMJw After : http://youtu.be/KuZ2QZKYj7c Cmon bruh quit acting bruh this the real you""

And it's true. Rocky completely bit SGP's style and flow and got big off it. He's a sucker.

Anyway

""IM NOT IN RAIDER KLAN. BUT I LOVE MY RAIDERS AND PURRP MY WOE. SO IF YOU FUCK WIT HOME TEAM YO FINNA GET PRESSURE. SCRAIT LIKE DAT!!""

""@asvpxrocky I KNOW BOUT YO ASS RAKIM

""@asvpxrocky When i see yo pussay ass in fla

""FUCK ASAP. WHEN I SEE EM FADE ON SIGHT. THATS REAL 100""

Big words for a 16 year old

Final summation: Rocky deserves to get his ass whooped by some real southern ass dudes if this ends up being his instigating ass starting this. SGP got robbed by Rocky big time when Purrp helped make his early shit sound dope. Rocky didn't even call him out by name, but I don't think he'll get involved like that, hopefully something on wax comes outta this though. Finally, fuck Rocky. From being a dope ass dude using internet stardom to fuck with the underground, now he's doing shit for GQ and wearing designer shit like hes Kanye or some shit? That ain't trill, and his 'trill wave' is garbage, but that's my opinion.

I'll try to elaborate if this is confusing. I always here people say, artists do this without relevance to a message.  Or another example would be, ""so and so has great wordplay."" But wordplay is using many meanings of a word or phrase. Metaphors/similes and wordplay are not the same thing, but it seems people get them confused a lot.

Stop worrying about being accepted.

not everyone will bless you with their acceptance

so its OK to be rejected

and take those lies and fucking eject them.

To many people are left affected.

So why not just do the opposite and effect it.

Everyone just hangs out with their own crew

You know the one they don’t let people into?

Come on guys

So why do we let the pain ensue?

You don’t need to hang out with these yahoos.

It will only lower your IQ.
