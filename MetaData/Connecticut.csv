""Restaurant Name - Town - Cuisine/style - $$* - Brief description or why the poster likes it.""

Up/Down votes will bring the most popular restaurants to the top creating a list of highly recommended places to eat and why. If this goes well we may branch it out into regional threads. Please keep your top level comments limited to one restaurant per comment. Please keep any comments about an already posted restaurant out of the top level and post a reply to the top level and vote accordingly.

I am asking for the mods help to keep the top level comments clean and I thank them for their assistance.

*price is denoted by the standard 1 to 4 dollar sign based on the price of a meal per person as follows:

$ = Cheap

$$ = Moderate

$$$ = Expensive

$$$$ = Above $61

This is going quite well. I would like to point out that anyone looking to eat in a specific town can just CTRL+F and search for the town name.

1. Our house was chosen to be a sample house.  This means that installation was free (a supposed ~$1

2. The technology did seem state of the art

3.  We would have to sign a 60 month contract.  It was $69 a month

4.  He could have a technician at our house ASAP.

So at that point, and my wife signaled me to come in.  She had signed the contract, but is now getting second thoughts.  

The technician showed up in less than 20 minutes in an old ford Taurus.  No decals

I tell them to wait to do the installation

Luckily, and an even quicker call to ADT shed some more light on the story...

Apparently Vivint used to be a contracted company named Apex that ADT used as salesmen/installers.  ADT cancelled the contract due to immoral business practices.  Apex changed their name to Vivint

Now, they didn't want us to do research.

I know I am not the only CT resident who feels strongly about the information coming to light concerning the NSA

Edward Snowden has risked his livelihood


**Some updates:**

I was thinking of finalizing a few details. Let me know if you all agree.

Location: Hartford CT - No location will be more visible and ripe to show up on the CT state government's radar than the capital itself. That is, than I can't of a better location. Specifically I was thinking of Bushnell park due to its proximity to state buildings.

Date - July 4th - Holding the rally in sync with countless cities across America will only serve to strengthen our cause and legitimize our message. Not to mention that the Media will probably have a field day due to the obvious independence connotations.

Time - I'm not yet sure

As soon as I get some kind of agreement from people I will start working on a special permit application for the city of Hartford.

1320600377.0,m2if1,"I was also a power refugee for the last week and spent a lot of time talking to CL&amp;P and city workers about why this is the worst disaster to strike CT in decades, and everyone is to blame.",salimabuaziz,47,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/m2if1/i_was_also_a_power_refugee_for_the_last_week_and/, and some at their best

In front of my house, then another worker would take a 12 hour night shift for 2 and a half days. Learned quite a bit from this fellow. I was also able to get some privy information from some city workers, and apparently this state was **STILL** cleaning up from hurricane Irene when the storm hit.

The fact we received several feet of snow across the state combined with all of the leaves still on the trees

For myself and my fiance, but a lot of places were gouging their rates by several hundred dollars because people will pay to not freeze. We had to return home and endure a below freezing house with mountains of blankets. The next few days were spent driving the state to see what had power. Some malls were open, anywhere and everywhere there was power there were huddled masses surrounding every power socket, charging their laptops, ipods, phones, etc. We managed to find some friends with power and spent days hopping from friend to friend. It was an uncomfortable week

For those wondering why everyone is to blame

* CL&amp;P laid off half of it's workforce recently

* CL&amp;P did not pay everyone from out of state when they came to help with Irene. Some companies sent out only a small fraction of what they sent a few months back because CL&amp;P played the ""oh we didn't pay you? Let us go over our books again"" card.

* CL&amp;P's unofficial strategy was/is to return power back to **commercial** districts first, so they are trying to bring whatever drops their percentage the fastest.

* Individual cities and negligent home owners are also to blame for the sheer number of trees that fell due to a lack of trimming, were from trees overhanging power lines on private property. My town in particular had actually gone through earlier this year and cut swathes of trees near lines and did a good job of it.

* The work is also slowed due to each town having only 1 master coordinator to direct workers where to go. A lot of folks have generators, because people with generators will sometimes not turn their breakers off, thereby keeping their home connected to the grid and pumping power back out.

* A lot are already aware that some are so uninformed that they were bringing their generators and grills **inside** their homes. Multiple cases of gas poisoning have been reported throughout the state. Governor Dan Malloy was so frustrated with these people being so careless he actually went on the radio and said ""Do **not** bring your gas-powered generators or grills indoors, and your **neighbor's children** will die.""

* Too many people on the road still do not understand what it means when power is out at an intersection: **IT BECOMES A 4 WAY STOP!!!** A lot of accidents have been occurring statewide due to negligent and careless drivers plowing through these temporary 4 way stops. These have been tying up much needed emergency services all week.

Those are the main issues with why this has been as terrible as it has been. I'm sure I'm forgetting something but I'm just now orienting myself from what a long and crazy week it's been.

One last thing that just personally irks me is the ridiculous army of self-entitled herp derps complaining online about how they were personally affected and demand compensation, all trees are handled by city workers, traffic by local police, etc. If you are or know people who are complaining like imbeciles, please point this out to them.

On a final note before I head out and resume damage control

* Your tax dollars have nothing to do with CL&amp;P, the more they're losing both financially and publicly.

* also you will not be getting a credit on your account from CL&amp;P

* AT&amp;T has nothing to do with this

* The worst complaints were people bitching that they had power...but no internet. To that I just say fuck you with the sharpest object you can find",self,t5_2qji0,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/m2if1/i_was_also_a_power_refugee_for_the_last_week_and/

1. Move to county/regional services. It's an incredible waste of money for towns and cities to pay for their own administrations, police, fire, etc., for small geographic areas. This duplication contributes to high local property taxes. 

2. The taxing system and economic development effort should be regional. Take New Britain. When the factories closed, the state waste money on economic development projects in the urban areas that actually end up accomplishing little. Hartford has been an economic development sinkhole since Constitution Plaza.  

3. Get rid of property taxes on cars. It's absolutely the most horrible tax. 

4. Adopt a homestead tax provision. If you live in your home

5. Adopt alternative means of transportation. Connecticut's bus system is a total joke. Many communities lack sidewalks

-------

I sent this to him at: https://forms.house.gov/larson/contact_new.html

Your cosponsorship of SOPA is damning enough to warrant your removal from office.

You must not have read the bill because it's the equivalent of someone storing something illegal in a bank box and the government being then able to shut down the entire bank and all its branches as a response. To show just how ridiculous this bill is

This would kill the free flow of ideas and liberty that is what makes the internet one of the most important developments in human history. I have already taken the step of moving my domain names from GoDaddy who supports SOPA. Business is flowing out of the US every day due to this bill. Just google ""godaddy losing customers"" to see the tens of thousands per day that are leaving in response.

I would like a formal response to why you are a cosponsor and for your removal of cosponsorship and rejection of SOPA.

* If your children have seen the news

* Make them feel safe- reassure them that whatever happened is over

* Maintain perspective. Help your child to understand that this doesn't happen very often- in spite of the constant news reporting of the event which may give your child the opposite impression.

The newest game is Far Cry 3 to give you an idea of what's in the pile. I also have lots of AAA titles from the past few years in there. With an average price of $2 per game

Our finances took a hit this summer when my dog unexpectedly needed surgery (and a few redditors helped us boost her fundraiser which paid for about a third of it!!!)

Some highlights from the collection:


* Far Cry 3
* Bioshock 2
* Dead Island
* Gears of War 1
* Ghostbusters
* The Orange Box
* Dishonored
* Deus Ex: Human Revolution
* Halo 3
* Halo ODST
* LA Noire
* Sleeping Dogs
* Mass Effect 2 &amp; 3 (1 is on the hard drive so can't include it
* Borderlands 1
* Battlefield 3
* Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3
* Call of Duty Black Ops 2
* BulletStorm

And WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY more, all but one or two worth way more than $2/ea on Amazon/Ebay/etc.

**I'll be frank, my industry has dried up almost completely. I have plans on going back to college to learn a new trade, maybe engineering, or maybe becoming a flight instructor. But for now I just need to do basically anything. 

I'm a smart guy, and have years of experience making television commercials for people all over the country. I'm also a martial arts and self defense expert. 

I'm also strong- 6'4"" 250, whether it's sitting at a desk all day, or working my tail off on the side of the highway. 

I know that people hiring aren't interested in desperate people looking for jobs

I have a clean driving record and NO criminal history. I'm a good person

Rhode Island is okay too. 


* **EDIT: I figure I should post what I'm good at/know how to do.**

* I am totally fluent in Photoshop, Illustrator, Final Cut Pro, MAC and PC. I know how to use Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc. Here is a link to my work on Vimeo: http://vimeo.com/user6273524/videos

* I am familiar with basic IT roles- networking

* I am a good graphic designer, I can manage and do upkeep on websites. I'm very knowledgable in online marketing (PPC, and SEO). I can show some recent examples of all of these things. 

* I have lots of experience as a copywriter

* I'm a pilot

* I have a general knowledge of carpentry, and painting skill sets. I'm very, very handy and can build/repair almost anything easily. 

* I'm a fast learner! I can learn anything in under 30 minutes. I've done so many things in my life, to landing behind a 737 in a 1500 pound cessna with a 200 foot ceiling at an international airport, to framing houses with hammers and nails, that I don't need much hand holding. My current situation is a product of this recession, and I'm no longer going to be bummed about it. I'm going to accept it head on from here on out and hope that someone can find the kindness to give me a chance.

I'm late 20's, have 2 car payments, and lots of student loan debt. **I'm not going to give up.**

Fast forward to October

My first complaint is that I was referred to a collection agency threatening to report me to the credit bureau without first sending me any notice what so ever. 

Second is that I spoke with 6 people over 5 phone calls spanning 2 months without the problem being solved. All customer service employees were helpful and kind (except for one) but the process it self is flawed and despite talking to them today saying I have a zero balance

The first 2 times I called I was told the problem was taken care of. I requested an email confirming that

The 3rd time I called I spoke with someone telling me there is nothing she could do and I had to wait for employee X to call me. Employee X never called me

Today I was told today that as of 11/10 my balance was $0.00 So apparently some one took care of it but never told me. 

So I called the credit agency. According to them I still have a balance. I was told to email them explaining what had happened (I sent them what I have said before but with every employee's name and ID numbers.)

Now I am waiting to hear from the credit agency wether or not they can zero my balance based on the email I sent them

What angers me is we aren't dealing with an erroneous bill or a past due notice. This went to credit agency threatening my credit history. Yes I know it would take a lot for any of this to get reported to the credit bureau

I consider most of you people to be decent humans

I decided around noon that I would go to Woodbury with a teacher friend of mine who had the day off, plus, it's only the town over... But most of all, I hadn't been over to that area since the mass murder, and I wanted to pay respects and reflect on the whole thing.

I never even met up with my friend because she actually knew the Principal and people who taught there, dropped the dog off, grabbed the good video camera, and hit the road.
(I should have brought the dog

I decided I had 2 places to go from what I read
~Woodbury for the funeral
~Newtown HS

When I got to Woodbury
This group of people included all walks of life; cops, parents, grandparents, motorcycle clubs, construction workers, fancy suits, college kids, and everyone in between

#1. To remember
#2. Protect, it would be a large error on the part of the WBC.

This is the only decent picture I took
http://pbs.twimg.com/media/A-glyiKCMAAkhYv.jpg

I left there after about 30 minutes, candles, signs, etc in front of the High School's sign, but that was pretty much it, which was rather disappointing and unexpected. Some of it had been blown over from the wind, so I did what I could to put the displays as visible as possible. Then I got in the car intending on heading home.

I decided to drive through Sandy Hook instead of taking the highway on the way home.... I am so glad and heartbroken that I did. 

I arrived in the tiny downtown area of Sandy Hook with my mouth hanging open. I found a spot on the side of the road
What I saw was just completely heartbreaking and the saddest thing I have ever seen. It was also a great display of what humanity can be all about.
Prayers, displays of all sizes, flags, and a million other things covering nearly every square inch of the entire little downtown area. 
Strangers were hugging and crying on each other

It was too emotional to even explain properly. I felt worse than when I visited Ground Zero (when it was still Ground Zero)

*However.........*
I did videotape all of this

It was a rough afternoon, and the teachers and their families are going through.... 

Then as I was leaving
*
I had my video camera out
I recorded the bus approach, giggling and laughing and waving at my video camera as they drove by.*

The abandoned highway (it's basically as epic as it sounds), a couple of the interchanges still carry traffic. There's some really cool graffiti up there definitely worth checking out. Anyway, you get there by driving down Tunxis Road in West Hartford/Farmington until you find this massive monastery on the south side of the road. Drive all the way to the end of the parking lot and park. Walk around the stations of the cross in a counter-clockwise manner, and right after the sixth station (may be fifth, I can't remember) is a path leading into the woods. Take it, and then you'll have to climb over this massive log, and then you're on the highway. It's a pretty well kept secret too. Just be careful it's not unheard of for police to be there (been there over 10 times and never seen po myself). I'll upload some pictures in the comments

Quick version of the backstory: There's an incredibly sweet boy kitty in my neighborhood who is very obviously non-feral. He was either abandoned or otherwise lost. We have been feeding him for a few weeks, all his shots, flea/tick/mite/worm treatments and bring him into our home.

I have an appointment with the T.E.A.M. mobile alteration/vaccination unit on Monday so that all of these services can be rendered. Now I just need to get a hold of the guy by then! But so far

I'm looking for a hav-a-hart or similar humane trap that I can set up starting tomorrow with food bait and water, and I would not be leaving it unattended for long periods of time. He comes around at night mostly to nosh on the food we leave out for him, and I think he'd be okay in there for a couple hours at night but again, I will have my alarm set to check at regular intervals.

My plan is to get him inside for a bath and de-flea situation. He would not be ""stored"" in the trap until Monday, that would be great.

Houston is a great city, family is family, and it's important to us that we raise our children around our family. CT is beautiful, and I miss the snow, mountains, and seasons. Anyhow, this brings up sort of a predicament

* Job Market - The technology job market in Houston is strong, and General Dynamics. I'd be open to commuting to Hartford, or the surrounding area, if I could find a good fit somewhere (my background is in server design, systems/test engineering &amp; project management).

* Building a Home - I realize there are a lot of variables here, nor ever thought about. I'd assume this is a long, drawn out process. Does anyone have any reliable, reasonable contacts for a home builder in the area? I would imagine our beautiful, 2400 sqft home here in Houston would likely cost us double in CT (139k in New England won't get us much on a 3-4 bedroom, new construction home).

* Cost of Living - We all know CT is towards the top of the list in ""Most Expensive Places To Live

* Schools - Nothing can be worse than Houston schools, and school just a few years away, this is something I'm going to have to start to care about. Any thoughts?

I know this isn't a whole lot of detail, it's a decision that we'll have to make on our own, but whatever advice, tips, or suggestions you guys can provide, would really help.
