I was thinking this is one of the cleverest teaser's I've ever seen. It nails the awful

Funny how that worked out

I looked it up, in this case a prequel. And even still, it could have worked as a tenth anniversary deal...pretty arbitrary amount of time to wait on a film they've apparently had plans to make since 2005.

Then I realized it was all on purpose. All the kids who saw Monsters

What can you reveal about *The Inside Out*

What about *The Good Dinosaur*?

Do you think *Monsters University* will live up to *Monsters

There has been a lot of talk about *Toy Story 4*. What do you have to say about these rumors

There is an empty slot for a film in November of 2015

November 2015 is also the 20 year anniversary of Toy Story. In fact, just 3 days after the original was released. Coincidence?

Would you rather fight 100 Flik sized Sulleys

What's your favorite movie?

What's your favorite Pixar movie?

What are your thoughts on how *Cars 2* was received by critics?

Have you guys at Pixar ever thought about doing a PG-13 movie?

What about something nobody expects

What other films have you guys thought about making sequels for?

What was the worst thing to ever happen to you while making a film?

What about the best? Weirdest? Funniest?

Will there be a sequel to *The Pixar Story*?

Will you tell everyone at Pixar that I love them and hope to work there someday?

Will you ever do another AMA? Will the rest of the staff do an AMA?

Watched TS3 again recently and realized how everything in the end of the whole story is absolutely perfect.

After reading their [22 rules of storytelling](http://laughingsquid.com/22-rules-of-storytelling-by-a-pixar-storyboard-artist/)

&gt;What is your character good at
&gt;Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard

After 15 years, to pull out all the stops, to make it so we can say and do absolutely everything for them that can be said or done, to create the most complete and satisfying end so that we can be happy to close the story. So... what is the worst possible final scenario for a toy? What is the best? How can we take them from the worst to the best and finish this story once and for all.""

And they did. What is the worst possible ending for a toy? Worse than ending up in the hands of the masochistic kid next door? Worse than retiring into a museum for eternity? Worse than being tortured by toddlers? What is hell for a toy? How about being burned in a massive incinerator as an abandoned and unloved toy... Yeah

How about the best possible ending... What is better than sitting in the attic of the boy you love? What is better than going with him to college as a keepsake: around but never actually played with? What is better than retiring to a daycare where you get played with, and being passed from one beloved owner to a little girl who still has a decade to play with you, pretend with you and love you... Yeah, that'll do too...

Now, we'll have Andy take out one whole afternoon from his busy college-bound schedule to introduce them to this girl. Then he'll give them the perfect send off... the thing these toys have wanted more than anything for the years they've been waiting in his toy box... he'll play with them... one. last. time. And then he will say good bye. And then they will be Bonnie's. And they will be played with and loved every day all over again... Yeah, that'll do...

Damn

WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS),Pudgekip,29,6,8,"**Please do no read the following if you do not want spoilers

I went to see Brave with my mother (and one of her friends and their 6 year old daughter and son). My impression of the movie was that it was about a rebellious young girl who's mother was a bit controlling and that she was just going out into the world to become more independent. I figured it would be the perfect movie to watch with my mother, let me go kthx"" (I'm 21 btw)


Well

I was trying my hardest not to break down in the part where little Merida is sitting with her mother. Because I remember a time when I was little and I was that close with her. No fighting

 I looked over a few seats (My mother and her friend were sitting together and I was sitting on the other end of everyone next to her kids) and she was crying.

God damn it.

A few things I should point out:

* I've never been really good at talking on an emotional level with my mother

* I was a tomboy-ish rebellious teen


* My hair is always unkept

* I've always been goofy and not very proper  (for example: I love to make faces in family pictures)

* I love archery.

* I tend to not listen to my mom. I love her dearly

* Finally


I know the movie itself hasn't gotten many *awesome* reviews


The end had me crying


So when it finished... we're leaving the theatre and I'm up ahead (trying to dry my tears), her hair, even the archery."" and she said this while she had tears in her eyes.... and I just couldn't hold it and we cried and hugged and stuff. I just didn't say anything... cause I've never been able to. I hope she knew what I was feeling though. ;-; I'm sure she did... shes my mom after all...

I'm sure we looked like two crazy ladies

My mom has always been there for me. She's always been kind and loving and caring... it's just I have a bit of an attitude problem... which

This movie really left an impression in me

There's so much more I want to say... but I want to say it to Pixar and the people who worked on Brave. Please please help me.

My thought is that Rio (though I haven't seen it) was not as memorable as their other movies like Ice Age and people are bound to forget about it sooner or later.

I had very high expectations of Brave, they would start with a fresh page.  Pixar hardly ever made any sequels, and their shorts are ultra adorable.  Even as I watched the trailers and it became more and more clear what the plot of Brave was, I still held out hope because it was Pixar.  I watched the whole movie with the mentality that Pixar could do no wrong.

I hated it.  I don't think it could really be called a *bad* movie.  It's very good quality and high budget, but she wants to explore the woods and shoot things with her bow.  There are literally hundreds of movies out there that are about this.  What happened to the company that cast rats, robots, and old men as their main characters?  We don't need another rebellious teenage girl.

Anyway.  I guess I'm ranting here.  I've talked to my friends and parents about this, but Pixar has got to be in the top.  It's easy to be mad at marketing executives for cancelling your favorite show, but it's a million times worse to watch it peter out until you're only watching it out of respect.  Please tell me that isn't going to happen to Pixar, and that Monsters University is going to be an awesome movie.",,False,self,False,t3_1awhsp

There hasn't been enough trailer footage for me to confirm this but its pretty self explanatory one you look at it.  It just kinda bothers me how some of the objects in the trailers (not counting the facilities themselves) don't look very period.  Again this may be done with the movie comes out but this is just what I noticed.

EDIT: As I was lying in bed I thought to myself ""If they're in their 50's then why is Mike dating Celia

And as WasabiSeventeen pointed out what I mean by period technology are certain vehicles, and anything else of that sort.  Most of the things in the monster world have that teeth design on most appliances but they should look like they're at least from the 90's or early 2000's.  They won't look human, but at least similar.

1320039575.0,luvjw,So i got bored one night and wrote a story... this is how it turned out... tell me what you think. [xpost from self],AV3R4G3_J03,1,0,0," This is my story about a penguin named Lost. Lost felt he was more than just a penguin. He knew he was meant for bigger things. So he took off on the adventure of a lifetime. Now, this is the real deal.
Lost, the ocean is huge and he had no view of land in any direction except back. But he kept swimming the direction he thought was right. He swam for almost ten straight days, taking various breaks of course. Until one day ten he saw a little speck of land off in the distance this only made him swim faster in hopes of getting to America as fast as possible. So he swam and swam till he finally made it to the beautiful beaches... he was there and not a minute to soon because here comes the night once again so he grabbed a fish and found shelter under a fallen cactus for the night
Lost used the next day to collect his thoughts… He looked around... Everything pointed to him being in Florida; beaches
Day 11 was about the same... still depressed still sitting ... a little less hope a little more hunger.
Day 12
He traveled all of day 12 and 13 looking for food... finding a bug here or there, or in a pond, or in the open, or flying around his head, There were a lot of bugs.... he wasn’t too hungry any more actually
As night past once again day 14 came. He saw a building in the distant he couldn’t believe it
he woke up on the morning of day 15 and as he was looking around he realized that there were tons of fridges near him and he wanted to make sure if he ever came back that he slept in the same fridge so he picked up a small plant with its dirt and put it in the fridge and shut the door. As he was walking out of the dump he noticed a pile of old dusty books
He had ended up in a box just outside of a mall on the morning of day 16. He was awoken by a helpless mom on the phone freaking out about some kind of Christmas gift or something. she sounded so sad and it really got to Lost. He felt bad, yesterday he saw an airport and since he wanted to make it to the states and didn’t want to swim he figured flying would be the easiest way to do so. he wondered around looking for the landmarks that he had made a mental note of, but it took him longer than he thought and he was growing weary ... until finally he saw the blue blimp balloon floating above the airport. He snuck into an employee entrance and headed straight for bag checking. Weaving through people until he made it to one of the lines, he snuck into one of the flyers bags. He only zipped it up part way as he felt himself get lifted onto a conveyor belt. As he looked around he saw a crumpled piece of paper with some sort of design on it... he didn’t know what it was though. and he drifted off to sleep once again.
 As he woke up on day 17 he knew he was in the bottom of the plane and he had to get out of the cramped bag. As he was exiting
He was looking for something that could get him off the plane when he lands. ""squeak"" what was that he thought? Squeak there it was again, up walked a mouse trying to get his life together.... Lost suggested a hobby to keep him occupied and the mouse thought that was smart. but what hobby? Lost quickly opened his parcel and held up the cook book that he had picked up earlier at the dump! PERFECT! Try this he said as he handed the mouse the book and went on his way. He really just needed to find a glider of some sort. To fly off the plane, but that would be too perfect. It was just then that he felt the plane begin to descend. They must be close he thought as he noticed a hatch by the wheel of the plane. He waited there till the plane landed, jumped out and ducked into a dark corner until morning
he slept uneasily that night so he was still tired on day 18 but he was planning on pushing through... but there was one problem
day 19 went better, so he opened he sack and handed her the bottle cap he grabbed from the plane. she was very pleases and lost went on his way Feeling happy. But it was becoming dark so he had to find a place to sleep when he noticed a red car sitting on the side of the road. So he hopped in and read the motivational speech to put him to sleep.
He woke suddenly on day 20 with the rev of the engine and quickly jumped out of the car ... not seeing who was driving. Unfortunately he forgot his reading materiel (the speech) he figured he could do without it. So he wondered on when something shiny caught his eye in the mud. after a small cleaning job he found that it was a wedding ring ... “a wedding ring?” He thought “What am i going to do with a wedding ring?” so he snuck up behind this big muscular dude and stuck it into his pocket. Hoping it would make him happy in the future. It felt good
He woke on the 21st day thinking that he needed to stop sleeping in boxes; his neck hurt and his foot was asleep.  But he pushed through,  She was really small... like ... she shouldn’t be out by herself but she was and Lost was thirsty. She gladly poured him a glass and said it was on the house, but lost felt bad so he gave her the note that said ""NEVER BE AFRAID"" he felt it a fair trade and walked on. 
After a quick sleep day 22 arose. that’s when i saw him, and asked him what he was doing in the states. He explained to me that he felt he was meant for something bigger, bigger than him and I... bigger than everyone.  he explained his whole story to me down to the last detail. i just laughed and told him he had done more than he could have ever imagined more than anyone else knows. 
you’ve done so much
You gave ratatouille his first cook book
you gave Andy’s mom his buzz light-year toy
your responsible for the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. incredible
you gave lightning McQueen the motivation to win a piston cup
you gave boo the courage to not be scared of monsters
you mapped out where marlin could find the dentist 
you gave Ellie her grape soda badge 
you preserved life in a fridge for eve to find
and you gave the circus bugs the reason they are in the circus  
You are literally the reason for the existence of all the Pixar movies...

-- That Earth is ravaged by fierce daily sandstorms... but somehow the tall

-- That Buy 'n' Large would use tiny little Wall-e trash bots to clean up the entire planet

-- That all of Earth could be covered in trash.  Earth is pretty big in terms of surface area.  You could probably dump trash in just the Grand Canyon and not fill it for a few milennia at least.

-- That a probe robot sent to inspect Earth for signs of life would have a ridiculously powerful laser death blaster it uses to instantly blow up anything that might be alive.

-- That a spaceship sending a probe to Earth would have the delivery rocket make two round trips

-- That a probe would have to bring back a physical specimen of life before Earth is deemed safe

-- That a civilization incapable of living sustainably on an entire planet could do so in the confined quarters of a spaceship.
