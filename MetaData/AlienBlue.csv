Hi all

I wanted to share another one of my projects that may come in handy for some of you.

Over the past few months

It is completely native

It's a far lighter project than Alien Blue and doesn't carry a lot of bells and whistles

So check it out

Many Alien Blue users have reported crash-on-launch/backgrounding issues. I wanted to let you know that I've managed to locate the cause and have already submitted a patch to Apple for approval.

Although there are many suggestions and fixes still left to implement

Depending on the current wait time of Apple's approval process

Imgur has recently changed their mobile website to include [sticky banner ads](http://i.imgur.com/VEiLV.png) at the bottom of the screen. These ads scroll with the content which can give the illusion that the advertising is embedded in Alien Blue itself.

So I want to re-iterate officially that the ads are **NOT** from Alien Blue. You can verify this by opening the imgur links in Mobile Safari. I don't use advertising of any sort.

I hope this helps to clarify things.

Cheers and best wishes

I wanted to gather some of your thoughts around the [recent changes](http://i.imgur.com/SXIQm.jpg) to Alien Blue's canvas (image gallery) feature on the iPhone.

How are you liking it so far? Does it feel more practical? Does it feel comfortable to use day-to-day?

The ability to play **gifs and videos** directly from within the canvas is coming very shortly. I'm also porting things across to the iPad

Cheers!

Jase

PS: I also wanted to offer some canvas related tips that you may not know:

* In full view

* Slide up or down to rapidly switch between full &amp; grid view

* 2-finger-tap to upvote

* You can use **groups** of subreddits to view a bunch of subreddits combined together at once

Hi all

Over the past several months

I managed to bring onboard the lead UX specialist from Lonely Planet - [Steven Caddy](http://www.stevencaddy.com/).  You've probably seen his work in almost every iPhone and iPad related Keynote Steve Jobs has delivered from the dawn of iOS.

Since February

It gets better.  Lonely Planet's lead Objective-C developer [Yori Mihalakopoulos](http://twitter.com/yori) is also working alongside me so that the application is even more impressive from a technical standpoint.  His work has also been featured throughout Apple's keynotes - and I assure you - he's nothing less than damn impressive.  Together

I wanted to let all of you know how thankful I am for the opportunity to develop these applications.  It was a result of all of your lovely messages and reviews that I was able to attract such accomplished people to this project.

When I initially developed Alien Blue for the iPhone

Very best wishes

Jason M.

A quick heads up

If you are on iOS 3.x and sync regularly with iTunes

Here's how you can back it up:

1. Open iTunes
2. Go into the **Apps** folder in the left sidebar
3. Right-click on Alien Blue / Alien Blue HD
4. Choose **Show in Finder**
5. Copy that file to a safe place somewhere on your drive

If iTunes ever overwrites your IPA

I know it's a pain in the butt

Alongside this feature is [Subreddit Grouping](http://i.imgur.com/0PJgM.png) which will allow you to manage a collection of subreddits and then view them all together with a single tap.

Both features are very tightly integrated. I'm currently working on making your groups sync via iCloud

Hope it all looks well so far folks. I better get back to coding!

Hi all

I thought I'd share what's coming up in the next set of updates to Alien Blue and Alien Blue HD.  Over the past few months

* pornography
* comics
* funny pics
* photography / design

I wanted to develop a different way to consume this type of content

Hope you enjoy it!

Hi all

The new version of Alien Blue for iPhone (v2.6) is almost ready

If you are on iOS 4.x and sync regularly with iTunes

Here's how you can back it up:

1. Open iTunes
2. Go into the Apps folder in the left sidebar
3. Right-click on Alien Blue
4. Choose Show in Finder
5. Copy that file to a safe place somewhere on your drive

If iTunes ever downloads and overwrites your IPA

Although the vast majority of you are already on iOS 5

Even seemingly trivial iOS updates for consumers (eg 5.1 to 5.1.1) actually patch a lot of bugs and stability issues behind the scenes for developers. It allows one-man shows (like myself) to piggy-back on Apple's development and testing rather than create hazardous workarounds of our own.

As I type this

Cheers and very best wishes!

Jase

[High-res image - best viewed on desktop](http://i.imgur.com/S5X6n.jpg)

This is the first of set of moderation tools

Rather than typing common mod messages and manually leaving comments

The template engine is really flexible and context aware. Here is a [closer look](http://i.imgur.com/ibDRK.png) at how templates can be edited and some of the [tags](http://i.imgur.com/IZdYa.png) that are built in.

The interactions are focused entirely on moderating as quickly as possible on a touch screen, or confirmations.

You'll also have access to mod queues

Moderating comments will be coming in a later update. Prior to tackling that

Hope it looks alright so far folks!

The iPhone update is currently in the hands of Apple's review team

For launch, depending on what is most comfortable for your hands.

It is iOS 3.x compatible

So for now

Lately

For example

I know that some people have expressed frustration with how long small fixes are taking and I am sympathetic to the aggravation that these delays cause.  As a user of Alien Blue myself, I'm on it.

The reason it takes me time to roll out tiny fixes is that I'm in the middle of coding a substantial update.  Each Alien Blue update results in drastic changes in the code base

Ideally

Beta testers of Alien Blue can tell you from experience that the testing period is quite lengthy prior to each App Store release.  Combined with the approval times

Although this is predominantly a retina related release

**Alien Blue for iPad 2.0.1**

* Critical Fix: Non-retina images showing showing on the new iPad
* High quality text rendering in Optimal Article view for iPad 2+
* Fixed: Canvas background distorts when rotating from Landscape to Portrait
* Fixed: Canvas comment count is off-center
* Fixed: /r/Bestof links don't show the subreddit and username unless the pane is forced to resize
* Fixed: Slight misalignment of show canvas button on retina iPad

I'm busily working on the next update which will give you some additional control over the **layout of panes** (and their widths).

Enjoy your new iPads folks!

---------------------------

Hi all

Closely following the [Alien Blue HD 1.1 update](http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/ds841/alien_blue_hd_v11_is_now_available_in_the_app/)

If you already use Alien Blue HD

New Features / Improvements:
----------------------------

* Added: View **User Details/History**
* Markup Support / **Comment Formatting** (Bold, Lists, Headers etc.) - Requires iOS 3.2+
* **Inline Links** - Requires iOS 3.2+ 
* Footnoted Link Buttons are now optional (can be toggled under Comment Settings)
* Mod Tools :: Part 1 :: **Moderator Mail**
* Subreddits are now cached (to allow very fast-switching)
* Added ""Extra Large"" and ""Largest"" options to Text Size selection
* Reduced memory footprint and improved performance
* AB now shows post title
* Added option to Clear Browser Cookies
* Added: Copy Link to Clipboard (when viewing article/photo/video)
* Added: Copy Reddit Link to Clipboard (when viewing comments)
* Added: **Copy Comment to Clipboard**
* Added: Scroll to Parent Comment
* Added: Email Comment
* Improved visual response of subscribing and unsubscribing to subreddits
* Added **Top sub-categories**: All time, Month etc.
* Reduced right-hand padding on post titles
* Added **Lookup User** feature in Subreddit Selector
* Added **Password Protection** (under Privacy settings) to lock Alien Blue.
* Auto-selects comment when finding context
* Added ""Auto-Load Posts while scrolling"" option
* Post titles are now used as the ""Subject"" when emailing a link
* Added ""My Profile"" to Subreddit Selector
* Ability to filter out subreddits (via the Exclude Posts) section

Fixes:
------------------------------

* [Critical] Fixed crash caused when canceling a comment that has content (on the Save/Discard screen)
* [Server Load Reduction] Alien Blue now Stores/caches subreddits on the device
* [Server Load Reduction] Reduced number of requests to authenticate/check messages
* [Server Load Reduction] Reduced frequency of checking announcements
* ** Additional caching and performance improvements to Messages are on the way in 2.2 **
* Improved handling of URLs that contain ampersands
* Patched memory leak when switching between comments
* Fixed Casual Subreddits that couldn't be deleted
* Fixed occasional squashed post information at the top of comments
* Fixed **internal Reddit.com links showing in Browser** instead of Alien Blue's Comment UI
* Improved handling of connection errors and timeouts
* Fixed ""(null)"" appearing when creating Self posts with no text content.
* Fixed some posts titles from cutting off
* Fixed submitter name overlapping the number of comments
* Fixed unnecessary padding after post details on comment threads
* Fixed ""1:"" links showing in 7f12u subreddit
* Fixed momentary white-flash when browsing to an Article in Night-Mode
* Fixed hard to tap Password field when adding Reddit Accounts

Comment Markup
------------------------------
**Bold**, headers and lists should now be rendered correctly.  I am still working on improving the appearance of quoted text as it's not perfect just yet.  I wrote up the comment markup engine in CoreText, so scroll performance should still be speedy.  The only caveat with comment markup and inline links is that you need at least iOS 3.2 (as the CoreText library isn't available in older versions of the iOS).

Inline Links
------------------------------
Similar to Alien Blue HD

Outstanding Issue :: Missing Subreddits
------------------------------
Quite a few people are reporting that some subreddits are not showing in their list.  For some reason

Hope you enjoy this update!  Please be sure to send me a PM or an email if you notice any other serious bugs.

Very best wishes

1333420566.0,rqkmp,Alien Blue 2.0.2 for iPad is now available,alien-blue-hd,226,13,74,"Hi all

It's a relatively small update

**New Features / Improvements:**

- **Retina subreddit icons**
- Ability to **collapse side-bar** (bottom left corner)
- Added option: **Resize Posts Pane** to Fit (Legacy Behavior) in Settings
- Added option: Use Original Reddit Subreddit Icons (non-retina) in Advanced Settings
- Improved highlight state for comment icon
- Improved image caching and performance
- Improved **sensitivity** to more easily switch between panes
- Ability to flush all image cache directly from Settings

**Gestures:** (**Visual Guide** available in Settings screen)

- Gesture: [Drag beyond a browser](http://i.imgur.com/KUpKe.png) pane to show comments
- Gesture: Drag beyond a comment pane to show article/photo/video

**Fixes:**

- Fixed: **Post list snapping** upward when switching posts
- Fixed: Occasional lack of visual response for rapid taps
- Fixed: Slight delay after tapping the ""Comment"" or ""Link"" before pane becomes visible
- Fixed: Thumbnails occasionally flickering when switching between posts
- Fixed: Cannot downvote a comment that has a single thumbnail link
- Fixed: Incorrect zoom level when tapping on Optimal browser
- Fixed: Post links to subreddits opening in web browser rather than natively

**Retina Subreddit Icons**

This update begins the introduction of custom high resolution [subreddit icons](http://i.imgur.com/AStmZ.jpg) for Alien Blue users.  Reddit's default subreddit icons don't scale well on retina devices and are often inconsistently positioned.

As you can imagine, so please bear with me while I roll these out. I can't take requests just yet, as I'm currently working backward from subreddit popularity.

If you'd like to help me in making these

**More control over pane widths**

One of the polarising attributes of the 2.0 update was the use of horizontal screen space. For those of you that prefer more width (like the 1.x versions)

- Collapse/expand side bar (changes appearance when you get orangered)
- Compact Portrait Panes (Settings -&gt; Appearance)
- Resize Posts pane to Fit - legacy behaviour (Settings -&gt; Posts)
- Disable Voting Icons (Settings-&gt;Posts)

I've split these into different settings to give you more control over behaviour. I'm still working on improving the balance between the use of screen space and giving enough breathing room to items onscreen so you'll continue to see refinements over the next couple of updates.

Hope you like it folks!

Cheers and best wishes

- Jase (alienblue)

Edit: I am talking about the option to add subreddits to a group and not the circlejerk+atheism default behavior. Check this image bellow. You can create a group with just some subreddits and access this group individually. Which is IMHO way better than the '+' default way. As you can see I have 2 different groups. One for   Game development and another one for Game of thrones. I can access then by the group or individually. its a killer feature.

Hi all

I've been busily preparing a significant (to put it lightly) update for iPad users. It leans on some of Apple's newer frameworks

If you're planning on sticking with iOS 4 for the foreseeable future

Here's how you can back it up:

1. Open iTunes
2. Go into the Apps folder in the left sidebar
3. Right-click on Alien Blue HD
4. Choose Show in Finder
5. Copy that file to a safe place somewhere on your drive

If iTunes ever downloads and overwrites your IPA

Before reporting any issues if your device is jailbroken, the less time he has to make the app even more awesome.

-------------------------------

Hi everyone

I've been working through a long list of bugs, it's on its way.  I prefer to release updates frequently, and sometimes it means that I need to roll out fixes/features over multiple releases.

Here's what you can find in Alien Blue HD v1.1.  I've highlighted some of the features most requested since the launch of ABHD:

New Features / Improvements:
----------------------------

* Added: View **User Details/History**

* Footnoted Link Buttons are now optional (can be toggled under Settings-&gt;Comment Settings)
* Improved Icon - Dropped the ""HD""

* Added ""Auto-Load Posts while scrolling"" option
* Post titles are now used as the ""Subject"" when emailing a link
* Added ""My Profile"" to Subreddit Selector
* Ability to filter out subreddits (via the Exclude Posts) section

Fixes:
------------------------------

* [Critical] Various rotation issues and sidebar problems in 4.x
* [Server Load Reduction] Alien Blue now Stores/caches subreddits on the device
* [Server Load Reduction] Reduced number of requests to authenticate/check messages
* [Server Load Reduction] Reduced frequency of checking announcements
* ** Additional caching on the way in 1.2 **

* Patched memory leak when switching between comments
* Fixed Casual Subreddits that couldn't be deleted
* Fixed crash when rapidly switching back and forth between an article and its comments
* Fixed occasional squashed post information at the top of comments
* Fixed **internal Reddit.com links showing in Browser** instead of Alien Blue's Comment UI
* Improved handling of connection errors and timeouts
* Fixed ""(null)"" appearing when creating Self posts with no text content.
* Fixed some posts titles from cutting off
* Fixed submitter name overlapping the number of comments
* Fixed unnecessary padding after post details on comment threads
* Fixed ""1:"" links showing in 7f12u subreddit
* Fixed posts coming up for the wrong subreddit when rapidly switching between subreddits
* Fixed momentary white-flash when browsing to an Article in Night-Mode
* Fixed hard to tap Password field when adding Reddit Accounts

Are these updates coming to the iPhone version as well?
-----------------------------------------------
Absolutely.  They're already awaiting approval and should be out very shortly.  I'll put up an announcement as soon as it's live on the app store.

Inline Links
------------------------------------------------
I just want to make a note for those of you who are blessed with larger fingers and often find links hard to tap.  I have developed Alien Blue to also check the area surrounding your tap so that you don't need to pixel-hunt links.  It is quite forgiving to misplaced taps.

Hope you like it.  Give it a shot

Very best wishes

I've fixed a host of [bugs](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=w8hhAEEg) and implemented some popular requests.

If the feedback from testing is positive (and stable)

Hope you like it. :)

Very best wishes

Some of you may have noticed that on-occasion Alien Blue drops the ball and doesn't provide you with consistent link previews for **YouTube** links.  This should all be sorted now:

I'll give it a shot here

[Video One](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI4lFjWoFqc)

[Video Two](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRf2mYrZmg&amp;feature=player_embedded)

If you're rocking Alien Blue Pro on the iPhone or Alien Blue for iPad

I've also beefed up the smarts when users link to the App Store. As you're all iPhone/iPad users

Like this: **(see footer)**

[Tiny Wings](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tiny-wings/id417817520?mt=8)

You get the idea. It's a small detail

I better get back to it! :)  Hope it all looks well so far.
