I wrote to Gov. Pence about a month ago when I learned that he's fighting Brent Steele's proposed changes to legislation regarding marijuana. So you know

I don't have the content of the first letter I wrote since I submitted it on the Indiana website. I do

Dear Asimovfan1:

Thank you for contact Governor Pence regarding House Bill 1006. He appreciates the time you took to express your views.  I apologize for not being able to respond to your letter sooner.
 
Governor Pence is committed to combating illegal drug use in Hoosier communities. He believes that illegal drug use lowers the quality of life of the individual drug use

House Bill 1006
 
Please be assured that Governor Pence monitors all legislation closely as it proceeds through the legislative process and thoroughly reviews all bills that are brought to him for his signature.


Again

Sincerely

Kristen Kane

Constituent Services Representative

Office of the Governor

And here is what I just emailed them back with;

Good morning

Several weeks ago I wrote your office urging you to reconsider your stance on penalties for marijuana possession and use. I did receive a letter back and for that I thank you. However

In fact

If you don't believe someone who has lived in Indiana all his life, active in church and charity and heavily involved in the youth of my community, then perhaps the national discourse will persuade.

In essence; prepare your inbox, every news bite related to this topic and forward it to your office. This isn't some vainglorious attempt to annoy. Rather the contrary. I hope you listen. I hope you learn. I hope you realize that YOUR constituents are actually suffering MORE because of the current legislation than they would otherwise.

Your response made the assertion ""that illegal drug use lowers the quality of life of the individual drug use

That's a rather nice and powerful comment

More lives are effected and ended by prescription drug abuse than cocaine and heroin combined

Try to put that in context for yourself and see if it hits home. Statistically speaking someone in your family has a relatively high chance of being negatively effected by alcohol use, racist and hypocritical legal dogma regarding its use and possession. 

Alcohol kills regularly

Please note the link I've included in this email which is the first of many I'll provide in my effort to bring realistic notions to my statehouse. 

http://www.aclu.org/billions-dollars-wasted-racially-biased-arrests

Please, or some other unreasonable belief it is only because they have been effected by the multi-decade long national war against drugs which has in all reality and in the face of all evidence patently failed not only to curb drug use, but has also failed to protect Americans or improve whatsoever the lives of the people of this nation and this state.

Governor Pence this state elected you with the hopes that you would govern reasonably and with the welfare of our citizens in mind. Making them criminals for using a drug which is less harmful than ones which are being prescribed by doctors or which they can purchase at the grocery store is not reasonable

Please know that I'll be submitting these letters in their full content to as many social media websites as I am able in an attempt to bring clarity and honesty to this discourse as it relates to such an important and serious topic.

Thank you again for your time

Sincerely

A very concerned constituent.  

I know there are a lot of great arguments out there for decriminalizing marijuana. If you at all agree with me

http://www.in.gov/gov/2333.htm

Please post your progress back to this spot and anywhere else you can think it might make a difference. In the next week or so I plan to send them the link with San Jose Police Chief Joe McNamara talking about this topic as well since he's very well spoken and about as informed as it gets.

Please do the same!!!

Dear Mr. XXXX


I appreciate the time you took to express your thoughts about cybersecurity. Like you

Similar to other national security challenges in the post-9/11 era, we have a responsibility to protect critical networks while we protect civil liberties and individual privacy.

Last Congress, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA). I supported this legislation because it gave U.S. businesses the support they need to better protect their customers and networks from a cyber attack, and included provisions to ensure that the private information of American citizens would remain private. This legislation also would have helped to defend our nation's computer networks by making it easier for the federal government and approved U.S. companies to share information about cyber threats and attacks. The 112th Congress ended before the Senate took action on this legislation.

Should future legislation concerning cybersecurity come to the floor of the Senate for a vote

It is a privilege to represent you and all Hoosiers in the U.S. Senate. Your continued correspondence is welcome and helps me to better represent our state. I encourage you to write,,False,self,t5_2qn7d,False,,True

*Of course

So, I think a meet-up would be fun.  The first thing that we need to do is establish some rules to ease the general awkwardness/bashfulness that is meeting new people for the first time.  So, as a friendly start, I propose the following:

1) *Complete anonymity.*  If we meet up, or Xavier.  Names with the letter X are pretty cool.)  This way no one can search your GW posts or your WTF posts or whatever.  Additionally, you have the choice of whether or not you want to share personal/user information with your fellow /r/indiana redditors at the meet-up after meeting them.

2) *Be respectful.*  If one of us is crude or mean or disrespectful to anyone

3) *Be understanding.*  People are different.  People like different things.  If it's not for you

4) *Don't be a creeper.*  This is not where you are going to meet the love of your life.  If you think it is


Remember when we were all in like 4th grade and someone in our class had a birthday party?  It's kind of like that, you bring jokes, and instead of one kid getting all the attention, we all get some of the attention.

For the meetup

Who: /r/Indiana users

What: Meet up.  Daytime cook-out/day at the Park.  Nighttime bar hopping.  Bring some food to grill and some food to share.  Bring outdoor games, fribees, kites, etc...

Where:  [Fort Harrison State Park](http://www.in.gov/dnr/parklake/2982.htm)

When:  [TBD](http://blog.reddit.com/2013/05/get-ready-for-global-reddit-meetup-day.html)  I say like a 3:00pm start time, do stuff, then get cleaned up and go out bar hopping later.  

**Cost:  Park Entry is $5/car.**

Why:  The park has a lot of things to do.  Bike riding, walking, running, lots of open grass areas for corn hole and the like.  

**You can bring propane gas grills and any alcohol that you want to the park.**

*Any firewood has to come from a store in Marion County and must have a USDA stamp on it.*

The Reddick Shelter is huge and can hold like 130 people, and there is plenty of parking nearby for people from out of town.  I also picked the park because it has a lot of kid friendly amenities so if some of us have kids, and can't ditch them, you can still participate and bring the tricycle-engines along.

After the cookout, or Broad Ripple, or castleton.

Again

What do you think?

**TL;DR: Cook out at Fort Harrison State Park and spend the day at the park doing stuff.  Also beer and corn.  Hopefully bacon.  Bar hopping later on.**",self,t5_2qn7d,1368137589.0,,purdue2,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Indiana/comments/1e01n3/in_response_to_the_indiana_reddit_meetup_here_is/

Years pass and I just accepted that I'd probably never see one outside of a zoo. In January of 2010, I was so deeply moved by the experience my eyes filled with tears. The following spring, I saw an eagle at Pine Hills Nature Preserve while hiking just a little bit off trail down a small creek.  Each year since, I've seen more and more eagles in the park.

This is the first year I've seen the birds outside of the park.  I saw one near my home, in 2011 the count was 110 nests.  I think as time goes on, the birds will become even more common, there may be a day in the near future when seeing an eagle isn't even a big deal anymore.

According to the case report filed with the prosecutor

The ensuing investigation involved multiple law enforcement agencies

Whooping cranes are an endangered species protected by both state and federal laws. Efforts to save whooping cranes began after their nationwide population dwindled to 15 birds in 1941

The Foundation reports there are nearly 600 whooping cranes today

The whooping crane shot in Knox County was part of a nesting pair that was taught its migratory path by ultra-light aircraft.

I want to hear the coolest thing to do in your town.  This is a challenge.  I love you guys

Edit: Sorry did not offend anyone.  Just meant to stir up some more interesting discussion.  Yes I know this is my first post here

I'm from Kokomo

Steer and the Stump.  Just sort of your basic dumb touristy stuff.  The steer is a giant old stuffed steer.  The stump is an enormous sycamore stump.  There used to be a phone booth inside.  Both are located at Highland Park.

Speaking of parks, a disc golf course, as well as basketball courts, tennis courts, a place for horse shoes and a couple baseball diamonds.  Jackson-Morrow Park has a couple miles of trails, including trails through a small wooded area.  It also has a pretty cool nature center.

On the complete other side of things

Along with that, good food.  Ned's Corner Pub is a local hot spot.  If you go there, get the tenderloin trust me.  There are a couple other decent ones, but we have new ones all the time so just ask anyone.

One of the greatest things to do in the middle of the night, affectionately known as Dirty Dan's.  I have brought people from all over the country here and they leave with a full belly, admitting these are the best donuts they have ever had.  Dan's opens at 1 am, so show up around 12:30 if you want to get a good spot in line on a friday or Saturday night.

A couple other cool things to visit:

Kokomo Opalescent (Sp?) Glass factory:  They produce stained glass used around the world.  Tours there are very interesting and there are even classes for glass blowing and stained glass.

Elwood Haynes Museum:  They argue that the first car was invented here.  No one outside of Kokomo seems to think that though.  Either way it is a fascinating look at Kokomo's past.

Seiberling Mansion:  This houses the Howard County Museum.  It is in an enormous mansion on Sycamore St between McCann and Phillips Streets.

Treasure Mart and Treasure Mart Mall are two very good places to go antiquing.

If you or anyone you know skateboards

Downtown is always a nice place to explore

Overall

These guys have been rude AND not completing work after payment with not only my parents but at least one of their neighbors. They got extremely rude and loud with a neighbor lady and they haven't gone back to do anything since then (not sure of the time frame). So my dad pays them after the first day for half and was going to pay the other half on completion. Yesterday as they were close to finishing up (needed to remove a few more stumps) they ask my dad for the rest so one of them can run to the bank before it closes and the rest will stay and finish up. Being the nice guy my father is he pays them and he goes in the house and 10 minutes later they're gone without finishing up and without saying a word.

3:

Washington State’s fiscal report of costs and benefits of this new legalization legislation yields a startling projection of $1.9 billion generated or saved during the program’s first 5 years. Michigan’s larger population indicates the Great Lakes State could reap a $2.8 billion payoff for initiating similar legislation. Per the Report: “Assuming a fully functioning marijuana market…estimated total revenue generated to the state could be as high as $1,000 over five fiscal years.” Michigan is the 8th largest state by population, with 9,883,640 residents per the 2010 US Census. Washington is 13th, with 6,724, making them 68% of Michigan’s size. Projecting these numbers reveals the potential for Michigan to capture $2.857 billion in revenue over five years.

Dear Mr. Minifig81

 

Thank you for taking the time to contact me about the enforcement of intellectual property protections on the internet.  I value your views

 

Patent and copyright protections are established in Article 1, using, or selling their invention without permission, in exchange for public disclosure of the invention when the patent is granted.  This ensures that both the inventor and the public gain from the utility of an idea. 

 

Over the last decade, Chinese manufacturers in recent years have blatantly stolen technologies and designs created by Hoosier businesses. This practice directly violates patent laws, and some argue that the loss of potential revenue negatively impacts the incentive to innovate.  Because part of America's economic power comes from our nation's unmatched capacity for innovation, any loss of IP could mean a loss of new jobs and economic growth.  

 

My primary concern is Hoosier jobs. That is why in the 110th Congress, but pressure other countries like China that do not do enough to crack down on and deter IP theft. 

 

The argument has been increasingly raised in favor of legislation protecting against the foreign threat of IP theft through the internet.  **While I agree that we must work to strongly prevent IP theft, all recent legislative efforts to address this issue have been slowed, allowing for more debate and discussion.  Please know that I will keep your concerns in mind should any legislation concerning IP protection be brought to the House floor for a vote, but that the creation and protection of Hoosier jobs will remain my greatest priority.

 

Thank you again for contacting me about this important issue.  Please do not hesitate to write, sign up for my e-newsletter, [The Donnelly Dispatch](http://donnelly.house.gov/contact/email-updates.shtml).
 

Sincerely

Joe Donnelly

From Greene county daily world. (Linton

There's a scam going around Greene County that preys on the elderly -- offering them boxed meat products at greatly inflated prices.

So far

Police need help from the public in putting a stop to the unlawful transactions.

The perpetrators are reported to be two, who have been identified as driving **two different Ford F-150 pickups with a chest-type freezer in the bed. One truck is blue, while the other is white,** according to O'Malley.

**One suspect has dark hair and is described as 6-foot-2 in height and weighing between 300 and 350 pounds. He's clean cut and has short hair.**

**The other man is younger and is about 5-8 tall with a slender build and blond hair.**

O'Malley said police have been able to obtain a good photo of the dark-haired older suspect from surveillance videotape at Bloomfield State Bank

The scam was first reported about a month ago and to date has victims or near-victims in Jasonville

One victim is reported to have received about 30 pounds of meat for $1, according to O'Malley.

""We just can't catch these guys

The pair is allegedly selling meat in black-colored boxes that have no brand names or logos on them. There is an official-looking United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspection sticker on the box

One recent brazen illegal transaction reportedly took place in the parking lot of the Dollar General Store on the south side of Bloomfield in which an elderly couple thought they were buying 17 boxes of meat. However, O'Malley explained.

There have also been reports of the duo in the rural areas of the county trying to bilk victims out of money or checks

In a case or two

Checks have been handed over and filled out in names that O'Malley suspects were simply lifted from the phone book.

""They appear to be cashing all the checks as soon as they get them

All county police agencies have been notified of the scam and told to be on the lookout for the suspects.

Anyone who has information about the case

""Most of these people (elderly victims) are on fixed incomes. These guys are just ripping people off. It's like they have no conscious whatsoever

Just thought I'd give a heads up to any one out there... 

They seem to be following this guide:

An Unethical Guide to the Street-Sold Stereo Speaker Business:

- kindly submitted by Le Saint

Do you want to make money?  Does the thought of bringing home a $1

It's easy as long as you (1) have a legal business license for the town you intend to sell in

All you need to learn are these few skills:
""The Hit""

Here you will learn to pick the best target to sell to. Within the business, age 20-35. These particular individuals seem to enjoy their electronic gadgets, regardless of cost, and the more high-tech they sound, the more they want them.

Men in expensive cars and trucks are the best to choose because they don't mind spending the extra money on nice things.

Preferably, the other person can have time to think about what is going on and may clue in their companion.
Avoid the elderly! Unless they seem to be particularly hip

Wives and girlfriends can be dangerous to your efforts, because there is nothing more demoralizing than a spineless man who after buying into your whole story says ""I love these things, but let me go ask my wife.""  Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the man will return, crestfallen to inform you that SHE doesn't want them.

A single woman in a car is a different story, but remember that you cannot be as aggressive with the sale.

""The Pitch""

This is the most important part of the entire process. The pitch is which you quickly (since you may be speeding down a road yelling out the window) tell your hit what you have to sell and why.

The story that you use is always the same. Why?  Because we have been in this business since the seventies and it works! The pitch must be given with all the excitement that you can muster. Remember

The pitch is:
"" Hey man

The majority of the population has an attention span of thirteen seconds before their mind begins to wander. This is because everyone is so used to the short spot commercials they see all day long on TV

After shouting out the pitch

Always tell your hit what to do. The concept is to take control of their mind
""The Show""

This is the time to let your dramatic skill shine. You are about to bring the hit to the van and actually show them the product that you are trying to sell for much more than its worth

You are only supposed to be a delivery driver who got overloaded, laminated, professional looking sheet, and you.

When the hit gets out of their car, since it will make your story much more believable.

If you just won the lottery

You tell the hit that you arrived to work in order to pick up your daily deliveries

Treat the hit as thought they know more about everything than you do. Build their ego and they will become your instant friend. While at the warehouse

Make your boss out to be a real hard-nose, and forget about the moral side of the issue. You need to bring back $200 for each pair sold, but the suggested retail price on the spec. sheet is $850 apiece, so you have a lot of leeway since all other money over $ 200 is your to keep.
While talking non-stop the whole time (don't give them time to think) occasionally shove the spec sheet in front of their face for emphasis

Now show them the speaker, so it's up to you to convince them that they need these things.

Always look them in the eye, but not too hard. In order to make it sound more solid, hit the wooden box of the speaker with the palm of your while your finger taps the woofer.

After going over the other qualities of the speaker, what's the most you can do?""

Then STOP! Do not say another word.

The Close

This is the only part of the show where silence is golden. You have asked the buying question

After receiving his offer

Pitch 'em high
After haggling (""Come on guy, most, most you can do?""), decide on how much you can get out of this person, and once your reach that figure, immediately say ""Where do you have to go to get the money?"" 

As you say this, o pen it and stuff the speaker in. If the hit had any doubts about the status of the sale, they are gone now. This is called ""the slam.""

Off to the Bank

If you are working with a partner, man, but you know how it is.""

Have your partner follow the two of you in the van, teller, or whatever, and stand right next to him, all the while talking about something other than the sale, so that he does not think about the fact that he is about to take out hundreds of dollars for something that he doesn't need.

If you happen to see that he has more money in his account, come on, these are worth almost $2,000 a pair and I'm giving them to you for $600 (a $400 profit under the false front of a good deal), you can do another fifty bucks."" They may buy this, they may not, but it's worth the try, since you are in control.

You have just successfully made $400 (which you split with your partner) for fifteen minutes of work. Not bad! Of course, the more you sell. Happy Hunting!",,False,self,t5_2qn7d,False,,

What do I mean with ""Willing to try using""? Well, as I think it might be very useful for someone in her Situation. That situation is, 3 years ago, she lost part of both arms, and suffered kidney damage, after contracting a deadly virus.

She had her left hand and most of her right forearm amputated, which makes her use the longer and healthier left nub for doing most things, as her short right nub is almost devoid of any sensation. She finds her way for doing things, and copes with just that, but due to the kidney damage she had some sort of medical access point fixed on her left arm, which prevents her from using prosthetic hands (for chance of damaging that access point, which will put her in mortal danger), three days a week

Her situation means that simply going to best buy and playing with a tablet might be challenging, and maybe even become a generally useful productivity tool. 

Basically, or some other 10"" tablet, just for her to try and using it in the comfort of her home, in her own pace. I would've lend something of that sort myself (I have a Kindle Fire HD), but Unfortunately for both me and her, I live in Israel, so I can't do that… 

I know it's a rather strange request, or know someone who might, please send me a PM, or comment and I'll PM you. Of course once we converse I will give some extra details, I just want to keep my friend's privacy.

**Indiana State Police advise where to donate
By Dann Denny 331-4350 | ddenny@heraldt.com
March 6

The Sellersburg Indiana State Police Post and other state police posts say they’ve received a slew of calls from people asking how they can help their fellow Hoosiers who’ve been ravaged by Friday’s string of devastating tornadoes.

Police officials say there are many legitimate ways to make cash donations

• United Way: To make a cash donation or to volunteer

• Red Cross: To make a cash donation or to volunteer with the American Red Cross, Louisville, KY 40210, or go to www.redcross.org.

• Another comprehensive list of legitimate locations to make cash donations can be found at the Indiana Department of Homeland Security site at http://www.aidmatrixnetwork.org/CashDonations/Default2.aspx?ST=INDIANA.

Police officials say that contacting these organizations instead of police will reduce the number of inquiries

Officials from the Indiana State Police and the Indiana Department of Homeland Security are cautioning Hoosiers to know who they’re donating money to before making a cash donation. They say that while there could be legitimate groups making door-to-door collections

Other options

A press release from U.S. Rep. Todd Young’s office said those who want to help with cleanup and recovery efforts can contact 812-287-0517 or go to 723 Spring St. in Jeffersonville between 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. It is the official volunteer coordination site.

Young said people can donate food

  When I grew up in a small farm town here in Indiana, and many are just closing up their practice when they retire.  The folks in the small communities are being forced to drive over an hour just to get medical care, something that can be hard for the elderly or chronically ill.  Now apparently the larger healthcare networks are shutting down some small practices without giving reason! (They also shut down our local maternity ward, which means women have to drive over an hour to give birth in a hospital leading many to opt for inductions rather than try to brave an hour of labor in the car.) 

It's getting more and more difficult to get in to the ones who are still around too.  There are days (sometimes weeks) of waiting for appointments

Personally

Anyway, but I think it's a serious issue we really need to start looking at, perhaps offer some kind of incentive packages to new doctors looking to open practices in smaller towns? ",,False,self,t5_2qn7d,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Indiana/comments/1ir4va/hometown_healthcare_a_thing_of_the_past/

1364937601.0,1bjj45,(x-post from r/SouthBend) The Warmth Project - Looking for a little momentum (Elkhart/Goshen area).,mainlysane,5,2,6,"Beginning at the end of August last year (2012) I had the fortune to run into a fellow who had no place to sleep. I caught him lying in a bush while I was taking my dog out for a bathroom break. Needless to say I frightened him as much

I took the time to talk to him. I told him about the local shelter (Faith Mission for Elkhart) and he told me he had been kicked out for fighting. Maybe he was telling the truth, and he got set up with temporarily free housing through my landlord. He ended up stiffing my landlord ultimately, but that's not the point.

The experience sort of resonated with me. In the weeks that followed I began noting the number of people with a certain ""homeless"" look about them wandering the streets of Elkhart. Once I started looking I couldn't help but see them. Then the weather got cold and crappy and I noticed I was still seeing them. I made a personal decision then to try to help in a proactive and immediate way. I couldn't fix these guys problems. I couldn't get them all set up with free housing. I couldn't even feed them all, and they had old blankets lying around as well.

For the next several weeks I would go out randomly

The number of people sleeping on the streets in Elkhart, even in a place as small as Elkhart.

I decided to organize. If I was really going to be able to help I was going to need to find more winter gear and more blankets, spoke with local homeless service providers and got busy.

Alas, my free time is limited, believe you me.) I came to r/SouthBend looking for a little help in spreading the message and hopefully finding more sources of donated blankets and winter gear (we mostly need blankets thanks to the wonderful people at Faith Mission who heard about what I was doing and unloaded bags of gloves and hats on me.) I figure I have a fair shot of catching a few Goshen/Elkhart locals lurking in here as well.

I've started a website, we won't see again until next winter) to help me cover more area. I go out on foot, so I am pretty limited in range and my biggest worry is that there are still people out there I am missing. I figure that for every one I find there are probably about two or three that I don't, if not more. Also, I can only focus on the Elkhart area. 

Thanks a lot for sticking it out this far if you're still reading. I appreciate any help

We're playing the Irving tomorrow night in Indianapolis. Right now we're in Bloomington without a place to crash.

If you live anywhere between Bloomington or Indianapolis

Check out my Facebook.com/johnnyzito for weeks of photo evidence that will support my story.  I can also provide a few references of other redditors we've bunked with on this tour. 

Thanks!
