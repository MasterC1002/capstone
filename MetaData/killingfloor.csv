**Another Edit:** For people having difficulty finding me on steam




When I first started playing on hard servers I was amazed at how good all the players were
As a medic I learned that I could support my team not only by healing
I learned that fleshpounds are incredibly vulnerable to grenades and that my medic armour could tank scrakes and fleshpounds if they began to charge
I began to wonder why it took me so long to start playing on hard servers

And then I remembered that
On normal my teammates and I would run around willy-nilly
I remembered finding that I was constantly cornered
Back then the thought of me playing on a hard server was laughable

Last night I decided to go on normal again, it had not changed one bit. 
I spawned after the 5th wave in WestLondon (a very easy map) to the sight of a lv 2 sharpshooter toting an m4, a lv 1 commando with a LAR and lo and behold a single lv 6 commando with a scar running off into the distance.
All of the low level guys were running around ignoring the fact that they all had quite low health
I decided not to change to medic

The round starts and sure enough the sound of a scar rattles in the distance. The newbies twitch and jump around nervously. I scan the top of the bridge for crawlers and stalkers. 

What followed was the most shambolic display of teamwork I have ever witnessed. 
Round after round the new players all die because there was no cohesion. They raged scrakes and fleshpounds and got cornered and butchered. 
The lv6 Commando did not share any of his money with the other players
When the patriarch came they did not stand a chance (I managed to carry by picking up the dead Commando's 'nade launcher).

I felt apalled that someone who was obviously more experienced at this very hard game would just leave these new players to it and not try to help. 
He left at the end of the map.

The next map loads and it is Office. 
This time I play medic. 
I ran around healing the team
I did not make fun of them for not knowing - what would be the point? 
I did not speak condescendingly - What's wrong with going a bit crazy and buying a husklauncher once in a while? They're new
I clued them in on each enemy's weakness
I showed them how important it is to run away
They learned that if you share the cash around to those who need it the whole team can survive easier and they started to understand that some classes need ammo boxes more than others.
They learned how to be a team. 

During that entire map there were only 2 deaths up until the patriarch. 
At the start of wave 8 I had to answer the door bell and when I came back the team had butchered the last scrake with disciplined volleys of shotgun fire. 

The patriarch still killed everyone but me (a lucky rocket took out 3) and I had to carry but then my deceased team mates would call out his location instead of being silent. They were all typing encouragement and watching how I evaded him - not bad for a team who didn't even speak once on the previous map.

I was so happy and proud of these new players that I played another map with them (Hospital Horrors) and this time we beat the patriarch with no casualties - the first time any of them had lived through the pat (pipebomb piles in a corridor ftw!).

Now

I am seeing many posts here on r/KF about how uncooperative players are on normal
It is not enough just to post links to a tutorial forum post - only ~1400 people who subscribe to this subreddit will ever see it.

To a new player

So, suicidal and Hell on Earth servers once in a while and show them why Killing Floor is such an exciting, stimulating and social game.

Go make me proud

**tl;dr** more experienced players need to play on normal difficulty servers and help the new guys once in a while.

1. Continuing to back away will cause the scrake to use his most damaging attack

2. Staying still means the scrake will also stand still while he attacks you

3. Staying still makes it easier for your team to heal you while you tank the damage.

How about a friendly Killing Floor tournament! **All calibers of players are welcome (don't be scared off because you just got it or don't feel very good!)** and the prize, with perhaps admin access to my server for a month or so. Let's encourage strategy oriented play and make some Steam friends! We'll be competing across **all difficulties** except beginner, with a victor team in each bracket. The dates will be worked around the schedules of the players involved - we'll make it work!

Teams consist of 6 players, class limits are increased to 4 per class with the exception of Berserker, which is still at 1.

A mutator will be used to equalize class levels: Normal = 3, and Hell on Earth = 6... so your class level doesn't really matter. Experience is what counts. The maximum amount of hours played to qualify for each bracket is: Normal &lt; 80, Hard &lt; 175, Suicidal &lt; 300, Hell on Earth &lt; Infinity.

Exploits will result in disqualification. Points will be awarded to teams based on how many waves were completed, or particularly genius strategies). Map assignments will be even and chosen randomly from the given pools, each team playing three rounds (round 1 having two maps played, the highest score from both maps being used).

Winning is as a team

If you don't have a team, talk with them, pick a captain, and sign up together! If you don't have enough members you want to form the full 6-man team, matchmaking will assign you players with the roles you need. Don't be afraid to message me about anything!

I've had Killing Floor for a long time now, but I've never really had the place to do it.  
Now

I hope what I'm going to say here doesn't come off as either pretentious or angry

**Defending a specific area**  
This kind of ties in to what I'm going to say later about each perk
When you are playing a map and camping a specific area
(Pretend we're in the tunnel in West London
The tunnel has two sides
I just played a match earlier today where the people were going back and forth
Now, shoots things, then to the other side, shoots things, etc.  
This leaves a huge gap when no one is watching one side of the tunnel, you name it.  
If you have a team, 2 at the back. Maybe a medic in the middle healing both.  
*Sure

Now
I'm sure you're all thinking,* and, *Other people need to learn what to do, not me*, but maybe this message isn't for you.  
Again

**Beserker**  
Pretty obvious. Kill things.  
Clots and Gorefasts are your main enemies
Sirens and Husks are also great for you
On easier difficulties, you should be willing to step in front of a fleshpound mauling a teammate.  
When defending an area (rather than kiting), which will allow you to avoid attacks from gorefasts and the like.  
You're fast
*watch out for crawlers

**Commando**  
A great perk, you're doing the most for it.  
Along with the beserker
That being said
Both of these zeds have an easy time creeping up on and killing beserkers and sharpshooters caught unaware
Your ability to kill crawlers is your largest asset to the team
While you can waste a whole mag on scrakes
You can also pick off bloats
Commandos are good partners with demomolitions

**Field Medic**  
There's not much to say here. Carrying both mediguns allows you to easily have a never ending stream of needles at higher levels
Keep an eye out for crawlers
You can consider carrying an xbow
Remember
In a defending situation you should move back and forth between battle zones

**Firebug**  
An interesting
You can adequately whittle away at smaller classes
When you are with a heavier class (sharp, do not burn the scrakes. This will mess up their aggro, which will make it harder for supports, or break a stunlock that may have been established.  
*you are a useful perk

**Sharpshooter**  
A class that I started with
Try and pair up with a commando, and focus your fire on the big things.  
It's ok to have a lower kill count
*A large focus will be on husks and sirens as they approach
Sharpshooter is a great perk
Try to agree with the demoman on focusing fires on different areas

**Support Specialist**  
A brilliant class.  
The role of either making sure nothing sneaks up on your team with an incredible welding ability
While there is nothing largely for a support to focus on
If a commando is being bogged down, and if they need money toss them some.    
That being said, and so you should remember that if a teammate is in need of dire help.  
Remember to crouch so you can hit crawlers
High five.    

**Demolitions**  
You have a large damage output, and certainly not the m32.  
You should try and focus on large enemies
Try to avoid blocking the views of sharpshooters, heed this next note:  
*If an ally, do not bombard it unless you know you can kill it*.  
When you don't kill it
Now, you just, like pyro, need to make sure that you are accommodating for the other people on your team.    


**tl;dr:** Remember to play what your perks strengths are, do not leave gaps, and everyone play zones, not man to man.

1347399058.0,zqb0n,Advanced Tactic: Siren Scream Cancelling,Fine_Cut,38,1,10,"This is unfortunately a lesser known tactic

The idea is to shoot, the siren just as her head goes down to scream (does not need to be a head shot), then **WAIT** until her head goes back up - during this time you can shoot her all you want (it's a tiny window of opportunity but it should be all you need in most cases), and you can continue cancelling by shooting again just before she dips her head.

It is important to **STOP** shooting once her head dips. Not doing so will cancel your cancel, a 'helpful' teammate will try to 'save' you from the siren, negating your cancel, and causing you to take damage from a full scream or that awful 'after death' scream the siren is famous for.

This is also a great way to avoid the shitty siren hitbox. When her head is down, and as it goes back up, pop off 2 m14 shots for the kill - or whatever tickles your fancy. It's also great for support: 9mm cancel as your moving towards it, when in range and immediately after a cancel, blast away with the hunting shotgun.

Smallish stuff started spawning and I noticed he had his knife out and was kiting them towards me. Now, Gummo ran ahead and blocked the door. Trying not to let it get to me, I finished off the last of the specimens and thought to myself ""Two can play at this game."" 

So, wave 7 began and he started following me around the map. I said to him in the chat ""lol were both so fast :D"". On my way around, I made sure to avoid narrow passages and stick to the street area as well as run him directly through every siren I found. After about 10 laps around the map, he left the server.

I've tried to explain to him that despite being a Level 6

He pretty much ignored me and told my other friends about the cheat software. As I expected

There was no crosshair, were not about to take the ego blow of playing on beginner, no sir, we decided to give normal a couple more shots. We almost made it to wave 2 once. About 45 minutes in, I had had enough. I declared this game a load of impossible horseshit. It sat stagnant in my steam inventory for a few months until one bored rainy day I decided to give it another honest shot on some public servers. Maybe the key to surviving that first wave was having more people around to watch your back. 

I joined a map that was on wave 10 - an impossible feat for me. ""These guys must be pretty pro"", reaffirming my belief that this game was the hardest zombie survival game ever made. The next map was the one I remember the best. 

It was my return to the manor, the top level. I was impressed. I actually survived until wave 4, but mostly due to my teams expertise. I didn't trust myself to stray too far from them but eventually I was overtaken by a surprise group of gorefasts and died in what seemed like an instant. I sat there cursing the game and decided to watch this level 6 guy play. He was a master. He never got caught off guard while reloading. He killed the specimens with precise shots, never spraying into a crowd. He never even stopped moving to aim. This guy finished each wave out - the rest of the team would wipe. Watching him was eye opening. A game I had declared impossible was being played by one guy who seemed to have an answer for everything. Never getting cornered, running out of ammo, or being surprised by anything. 

It changed the way I looked at the game. Instead of being impossible, I wouldn't run out of ammo. Eventually I learned that taking out the red guys with blade arms was more important than the slower clots. I began surviving waves, and having money to spend. I was able to afford the bullpup. I was progressing in perk levels. I played mostly on west london and biotics lab. I still got surrounded quite easily on farm as the team liked to move around a lot, the offices were confusing and the monsters seemed to come from everywhere. I compelled myself to stick with it.

Eventually after many grinds of the basic maps, which I leveled up significantly faster than commando. I attributed this to me just being better, and sharpshooter felt even more invincible at level 6. I could take down EVERYTHING with some well placed shots. The only thing I felt ever had a chance at killing me was the patriarch. I even leveled up a few more perks. I was the killing floor king.

Then the Halloween event started. One of the new achievements  to unlock the commando chicken was ""Beat a long match on Bedlam on hard"".

I really wanted that fucking commando chicken. I knew I had once thought normal impossible, I just thought I was good.

I joined a bedlam match on hard. I died the 2nd wave. I couldn't believe it. The zeds... they moved so much faster. They were overtaking me before I could line up all the head shots. It took quite a few more attempts. We had 2 guys from a clan join and tell us to hold the hallway near the spawn. We made it to wave 10. I had been commando, but I did as the two clan players instructed and we disposed of him very quickly. I had that commando chicken. I felt accomplished. My e-peen grew three sizes that day.

But I had enough of hard. It had lived up to its moniker - it WAS hard. I made it my goal to get every perk up to level 6. I did this on normal difficulty. It took a long time. Long enough that by the time I got my last perk, consistently. Not to shoot scrakes or fleshpounds unless you are going to kill them. Not to put pipes behind welded doors for the patriarch. Little things here and there, little tidbits of knowledge and skill that only come from playing the game. Many hours in, I had every perk to level 6. The game I once deemed an impossible pile of horseshit was now laughably easy. Now what? 

Most people would say 'well now you go on to hard, and then hell on earth'.

I reset my perks back to 0 with some clever file editing to do it all again. I wanted to feel that feeling of desperation again

But it wasn't happening. Even with my perks at level 0

I decided to jump to hard. My last foray into hard had been a while ago at this point and now hard did not seem as daunting as it was when I first tried. Even as a level 0, I wasn't nervously looking around. I was making calculated shots. Looking where I knew zombies would spawn from. Holding locations I knew to be safe. Playing perks to compensate for my teams weaknesses. It's not your perk level that makes you good at killing floor, it's your mastery of the mechanics.

I had beaten every map on hard. Next I started with suicidal. The jump from hard to suicidal is harder than the jump from suicidal to hell on earth.

Scrakes no longer are instantly decapped or flinch locked with the katana. Fleshpounds have headshot resistances. You don't even come close to out running crawlers, that pipe bomb better be out of sirens range, you won't have time to reload when those gorefasts start charging. Sure, strategy and load out were important, it was important before. The challenge now was being able to utilize it all as effectively as possible. It was only a matter of time before I had completed every map on not only suicidal, but hell on earth as well.

And what now? Has the game been beaten?

Not even close.

The curse of challenging yourself to become better is that you become more aware of where your weaknesses are

I still like to see how viable the claymore is on certain maps for the beserker - is it useful for camping with. What other weapons are the best to carry with it.

The husk gun can stun scrakes.. is there a spot on any map and perk combination where this could be the best way to use it? (The answer is yes)

The combinations and ideas are limited to your own creativity.

So what is there to take away from this long winded rant? I'd say that there is more to this game than appears on the surface as long as you set yourself to the challenge. Have fun exploring those maps. Discovering those kiting routes and safe camp areas. If you find yourself not being challenged, enjoy yourself.

1366238411.0,1ckdff,What would you like to see in (a hypothetical) Killing Floor 2?,Ihmhi,24,5,59,"Here's my (short) list:

&amp;nbsp;

**Players cannot block the Trader door:**

When the Anti-blocker mutator is on practically *every server*

&amp;nbsp;

**Others cannot pick up your dropped weapons:**

If you die and drop a weapon

So

&amp;nbsp;

**Make tossing weapons to players (or on the ground) more intuitive

Put your crosshair over a player and tap the ""Throw Weapon"" key. So long as they are close enough, look at anything other than a player and hold the ""Drop weapon"" key.

As for money

&amp;nbsp;

**Don't use optics to balance the game:**

This might be a bit controversial

You already have a perk-levelling system in the game. Just give us Call of Duty/Battlefield style upgrades for the guns where we can put on whichever custom optics we'd like to. Standard iron sights, and grenade launchers could have an option for special grenade-launcher sights.

&amp;nbsp;

**Balance the starting gear on cost:**

If you want to sell *all* of your starting gear, respawn. Pick up your second pistol, sell that and your second crossbow, and *then* change to the appropriate perk and buy stuff with all of your dosh.

This can be solved in two easy steps.

First

Given that the Crossbow sells for £600

But what about the armor?

Screw it, balance it so you can sell the spawn weapon + armor for £600. (For Medic, maybe make the Armor worth £50 at 100% since Medic gets a discount on armor.)

&amp;nbsp;

**Give us more cosmetic options - specifically

The Golden Weapons pack is 100% superficial and cosmetic just like all Tripwire DLC - with the exception of the community weapons pack. I don't 100% agree with how they handled the community weapons pack

Give us options for guns that are just cosmetic so we can customize things more. Give us a camo option. Give us a ""wrapped in rags and duct-tape"" option. Give us a ""battle-damaged"" option. Just simple skinning and bump-mapping that looks a bit different so we can stand out from the other guy.

&amp;nbsp;

**Voices

I get that recording people is expensive

I understand it takes a fair bit of work to get someone in the studio to record. I'd say it's less work than a modeller making a quality character model + skin

I'd like to see the individual starting characters each have their own voice

Alternatively, Male 3, Female 1, Female 2, Female 3). Premium voice packs can come out after the fact.

I mean honestly

&amp;nbsp;

**Add an option for saving load-outs:**

At some point

Give us an option to buy ""Loadouts"". It would simply be a saved list of your favorite guns (with absolutely no limit as to how many you can save

Here's an example: As Support, and M79. So I could create a loadout named ""Support Patriarch"" and it would be under a new tab in the trader window. The cost would be the total of those three weapons (which would properly factor in the discounts - in this case I'd get a discounted AA12 as Support) and I would automatically buy all three instead of having to scroll through the long list to get off-perk weapons.

&amp;nbsp;

**Gunslinger Perk:**

All of the perks stand out pretty well right now. They all have their niches. People have been asking for a gunslinger perk - a handguns expert - for a long time right now.

I don't really have an incredibly compelling game balance reason to explain this. Sure

Sit down

&amp;nbsp;

Well

The biggest complaint I've heard about Killing Floor from friends who I've recently introduced the game to is that it's very dated graphically. I'm seriously hoping that Tripwire is looking into licensing the Unreal 4 engine and we're going to get a newer

The Zed Density Control Mutator is a mutator that allows you to alter how many specimens be out at the same time. It also can reduce the time between spawns at the ZombieVolumes.  With the right adjustments it can become quite overwhelming. These screenshots were taken with the values of 200 zeds at same time and 0 sec spawn time along with FakedPlayers mutator to insure that more zed spawn is possible. Unfortunately my computer can not handle such a volume of Zeds making the gameplay impossible

All the people I'm playing with don't seem to understand the concept of strategy. In normal mode, but whatever. It's normal mode.

But then I get to hard mode, they should know the concepts of strategy, like not raging a flesh pound and such. But no. People are still splitting up, running around trying to be a solo badass, then die one by one, and inevitably I am usually the last one running around with like ~100 or so zed, and then I usually die as well.

So I guess what I am saying is how do you guys find good games?

I mean

Me: Hey guys

One of them: No

So how do you guys deal with this? Anyone want to play with me so I don't have to go to random lobbies?

* *Husk:* I don't think this gun is worth the price at low levels

* *Flame Thrower:* The firebug's headline weapon is better than people seem to give it credit for. It can easily ignite a whole crowd, a lot of ammo, and reloads fast enough. Nonetheless, it doesn't have the chutzpah to burn down the bigger units, and may just enrage them. The real disadvantage, in my opinion, is that you cannot carry both the Trench *and* the Thrower.

* *Trench Gun:* I find this to be the dark horse of the Firebug arsenal. For its price, and you can keep yourself constantly topped off, a la Support shotgun.

* *Mac-10:* For it's size and price, it can get head shots, but everything it can accomplish, the Trench can probably surpass, save for quick reloading. Its advantage over the Trench is that it can be carried with the Thrower.

* *Flare Revolver:* I initially underestimated this gun. It can quickly ignite tight groups of clots, you can carry two, but, in my experience, that makes it far more difficult to land those head shots.

1365285737.0,1bthde,Can you give me advice on how not to piss people off on HoE? I seem to do it inadvertently.,solidus-flux,16,0,21,"***TL;DR: I've run into so many assholes online that I need to make sure it really is them and it's not just me who is the asshole.***

I leveled all my perks up to 6 on Hard. That difficulty level seems to have a lot of casual gamers, but I figure it's worth talking about anyway.

**First

1. Throw new players cash
2. Heal people when you can
3. Help people weld
4. Don't block
5. If everyone's holing up and you want to kite
6. Don't rage fleshpounds or scrakes unless you have the firepower to take them down
7. If a zerk is soloing a FP
8. If you are playing demolitions

**Some of the problems I've run into:**

1. On wave 2 of Biotics Lab, etc. Two people already went to check the 2 doors (if you know Biotics Lab you know the 2), so I thought it was covered. No idea why he got so upset other than I was killing a lot of specimens.

2. Was playing West London solo and another guy joined. We were kiting the map clockwise but he kept hanging back to kill specimens. I suggested we advance aggressively and stay ahead of the pack (going back only when it was safe to do so), you are supposed to stay way ahead of the monsters, right? If you hang back too long, too many spawn in front of you and that throws off the strategy.**

3. Joined a game on Biohazard and two guys were camped in the lounge area with the couches. I was zerk and was thinning out the crowd at the doorway. They asked me to change perks and I asked why. They said ""we don't want or need a faggot zerk"". Are there certain maps or strategies where it's considered rude to zerk or something

4. Was asked to go demo during a game on biotics lab by a sharpshooter and his friend, I should pick some other perk. The sharpshooter missed an FP three times with an m99 and it got up in his face. I thought he was going to die, so I unloaded my m32 to take out the FP. The guy was irate that I spammed grenades. Next round he missed his shots again so I did nothing, as he advised. He died and called me a faggot. I can never win! **How the fuck does one properly play demo and not piss people off?** I was also once yelled at for placing pipebombs at the start of the round. A player said that I should not place pipes until I actually see a FP, and that I should know better. How are you supposed to get into position quickly enough? Or is this guy full of shit?

You get no bonus to damage, or about 1/2 of an AA-12 shot), I've found it to be a nice backup weapon if the map allows you to use it well, such as a funnel point so you can fire n forget clot/gorefast groups. Also, you can start crisping up big guys from behind the group, even if the shot has to go through other ZEDs to reach them.

[RANT] I was a medic working on getting to level 6, we were in a tight space and couldn't make an escape. 

After my death I tried to explain to him strategies for defeating a fleshpound. Another guy in the server jumps in and says ""It's not his fault that we lost that wave."" ""Well it kinda was"" I say. ""Well I didn't see you do anything that wave. You didn't heal me at all."" ""Yeah

Derp then goes on to change his class and I realize he's a lvl 6 demo. How can you play long enough to get to lvl 6 demo and not learn how to properly deal with scrakes and fleshpounds !? And then I become the bad guy on the server for trying to calmly explain to him how to deal with enemies. [/RANT]

Since when does calmly explaining tactics and strategy all of a sudden become ""raging ?"" If I was raging I would have called him a dumbshit and left the game. I'm not very angry and would rather explain to players how to properly deal with enemies so this kind of situation doesn't happen again.

Nobody pays attention to medics lately either. They lose 10 health and they have to heal themselves even though they're getting swarmed with enemies and here I am healing them. It's like they can't comprehend that I'm doing my best to keep them alive

Pipe bombs are now wasted more often than not too. We had a good demo place pipes and a majority of the team wouldn't let the pipes deal with scrakes and FPs. They'd rather piss them off and let them run over the pipes setting them off without doing significant damage. 

All these lower level sharpshooters play like cowboys. They'd rather run around wasting bullets dual wielding than to learn how to properly headshot. Just a waste of bullets and all it does is make specimens harder to headshot when I'm actually playing sharpshooter. Here I am 1 shot 1 kill dealing with a herd of specimens and they run over and start unloading clips into this herd making them harder to kill for me

Another game I got the traveling team. They couldn't sit tight and hold off a spot instead they had to keep on moving and ditch half of the team when they did. Thanks to their constant moving they always ended up in shitty situations they didn't plan for like cornered in a hallway. 

I've ran into so many bad situations lately thanks to the stupidity of my teammates. It's like the average IQ of the player base has dropped 50% and they'd rather bitch

There are still good players just a lot harder to find a good team. I ran into this newbie a couple games ago. He was new to the game and had already learned the terminology (scrake, haha.

first off, a problem that seams to be very prevolent with this game is how annoying it is to start up.

If you start up the game the first time, and will crash when it begins to install XMA.

To fix this issue

program files x86\steam\steamapps\common\dwarfs (or similar name)\depends\xma. 

You should find a .exe installer inside of the xma folder. Install it

Hopefuly this will lead you to you mighty dwarven excalibur faster than ever!

Then on mountain pass (gah) there were a couple of noobs left against patty and they were just running around the map for about 15 minutes or so.

On the other hand the MK23 is a vast improvement.  It's a .45 pistol that sounds exactly like a .45 pistol.  The IJC weapon pack MK23 has a very muted noise that I do not enjoy.  I know a true MK23 spec'd out is a silenced sidearm but this game does not have it silenced.  The Tripwire added MK23 is amazing and now the sound matches the (over)power.

* Medics

Not sure here, axe-medic, and stuff like that.


* Support

**Scrakes:** I've seen a level 6 support down a Scrake with one hunting shotgun alt-fire, and shot down at its head in mid-air. Is this viable?

**Fleshpounds:** Toss a grenade, assuming high enough perk level?

**Bonus nubbery tactic!** W+M1 AA12


* Sharpshooter

**Scrakes:** is it possible to stunlock them forever with repeated crossbow headshots?

**Fleshpounds:** I'm assuming at around Suicidal difficulty


* Commando

Yeah...do they have anything viable against Scrakes and Fleshpounds?


* Berserker

**Scrakes:** I know you can just take a Katana and walk up to a Scrake while holding left click and aiming at its head. At what difficulty/amount of players does this stop being effective? Beyond that

**Fleshpounds:** I assume the strategy to use here is to slowly kite


* Firebug

**Scrakes:** is it possible to stunlock forever with repeated fully charged Husk Launcher headshots? This seems to be the only reliable way to survive.

**Fleshpounds:** lol


* Demolitions

**Scrakes:** uh...pipe bombs and M32 spam and hope for the best?

The zeds will begin to spawn just out of sight to the left or right of the visible corridor


Example
The zeds generally come from the right, as far right as possible.

You will see things (if there is a visible kill counter) like:
6 CLOTS
2 SIRENS
3 CRAWLERS

For each M79 round. It is possible

Basically the grenade is going right under the zeds as they spawn / fall to the ground and they all get vaporized.

Consistent kills per game:
HOE Hellride 630+ kills and similar for other maps.

Try it out, or feed the other squad members money.

Now mind you that was 630+ kills not being a total selfish jerk who will bore the other players with no kills. You have to let some through :-)

*check to make sure the server you are on has perks enabled (check the *perks enabled* checkbox in the server browser)

They move out; clones move in. Your squad is assigned to clear out the town. You go to the gathering hall since there's not many clones there, and set up shop. Then in the middle of the night, a shit ton of clones start moving in on the hall, leaving you to kill the bastards.

1343714948.0,xfq7u,Firebug Loadouts,,9,3,16,"Hello r/killingfloor

I'm new to the game and the community, two possibilities have stood out to me:

* The Mac-10 and Flamethrower. This is the less expensive loadout. Though they are inexpensive weapons, and beneficial to the team for crowd control of low to medium power enemies like clots, gorefasts, crawlers, etc.

* The Mac-10 and Husk Fireball. This takes a few rounds to save up for, at least in situations where other classes are distracted, like Scrakes and Fleshpounds. However, crowd control appears to be less effective. The Husk, weighing 8 instead of 10, allows for another sidearm. I usually select the .44, as it is able to kill stronger opponents in a couple cylinders.

Is one loadout clearly better for higher difficulties? I understand that the price-tag would suggest that the Husk is the better option, like a Commando. Additionally, the .44 is completely negotiable. Is it the optimal 2-block choice? Finally, is the Mac-10 immutable? It seems a shame to not exploit the afterburn, but a shotgun is attractive in some situations.

*(Opinionated sidenote: I honestly believe that while raging FPs may be seen as griefing

Anyways

I joined a server, so the people on the East Coast: don't worry too much about it). I sat in there for maybe two or so minutes with a guy who was ready to go and another AFK person--either that, or he was just ridiculously quiet--when suddenly three more people join. They jostle around the Ready button a bit, bouncing back and forth between Ready and Unready. I'm a bit curious about this, but then my curiousity turns to annoyance when one of the three tells me something along the lines of ""**** or john, leave so one of our bros can join."" Huh. Well, I was here first, there's a lot of other available servers you can join.""

No response. I wait a minute or so and the three are still silent. Suddenly
""Shephard.""
""Wrex.""
""Shephard.""
""Wrex.""
""Wrex."" (Two tried to respond at the same time)
""Shephard.""
""Wrex.""
""Shephard."" And so on. 

They keep doing this for three or so minutes, game would auto-start). So here I am thinking ""Yay! Game time!""

Well. Apparently the three are a bit miffed I or AFK-guy didn't leave, trick worked on AFK-guy (I'd be surprised if it didn't). I chased after them for a while, but then decided ""Fuck it"" and ran off on my lonesome. Nice thing about berzerker is that you don't die easily. So I didn't.

I apologize if you actually took the time to read everything before this

Trader time between Wave 1 and Wave 2. We all run in, a Level 5 Commando. 

So here's the main part: I toss him a few quid (pounds, rupees, whatever you guys at Tripwire use over there) and I expect him to use it to buy stuff. Well, he doesn't. Then Wave 2 starts. He pulls out his knife and runs around everywhere, trying to toss cash into inaccessible places. No problem, this kid just has ADHD or something, right? NOPE. After tossing all his cash and specifically waiting for the Wave to start so there's about 120 or so zombies between the four of us (Me, AFK-dude, Crawler gets Random Guy (he leaves)

So now my question for you guys is this: is the aforementioned action of sorrow and frustration and general all-around blllarrrgghhhness done by ADHD-boy considered griefing? I felt like this was done out of spite

Just in case you wanted to know, then left when they saw me alone, taking my sweet time soloing. Wave ends, Trader time, AFK-dude still here AFKing. Level 5 Support joins, doesn't make it to Trader, Wave 3 starts, I had given up on relaxing (soloing is not relaxing at all

Story ends here. Two more people join
Generic automated response ""Yes.""
I ask them ""What level are you guys?""
Good news for me
Rest of the waves went well--we just hid in a corner

Yay

**TL:DR** Is joining for the sole purpose of spawning more zombies for the lone guy who inadvertently pissed off a group of people by not leaving considered griefing? It's not on the wiki article,False,self,t5_2rf65,False,,,t3_tk6mg

&gt;""Tripwire

&gt;I've been a huge fan of Killing Floor ever since it came out and still play it regularly with a large group of friends I've introduced to it. We all work at the same part time job so when we're at work we talk about Killing Floor and when we come home we play it. It's a lot of fun.

&gt;Unfortunately, but they disappear when he disconnects. There are absolutely no answers on the forum and as fans it really hurts to see no solutions or responses from anyone. We thought with the Christmas update it would fix it. Color us surprised when we updated and he still has this issue. The only thing this leaves us with is the idea that Tripwire would create a poor port for the Mac and then not bother fixing it, leaving all the Mac fans in the dust. It sucks, and none of us enjoy it anymore because all we can think about it is how we'd have to force one of our friends to purely tolerate this irritating bug until some probable future date where Tripwire maybe might fix it or just release more non-working events.

&gt;Is there anything we can do to get this fixed? At this point we've tried everything. We want to keep playing Tripwire games

&gt;Thanks for your time

Gloves are easy, or see which ones I like better, is the over-the-shoulder pouch. If anyone can find something similar or identical to Steampunk Mr. Fosters

1: Medics only advance their level if they heal teammates. So if you are injured and it isn't crucial that you heal yourself now

2: Medics don't need a lot of money to buy their best weapons so dropping a little extra money to them in the first 1-3 rounds will allow them to easily do their job. Also for subsequent rounds their upkeep costs are low so they can dole out some money to everyone to pay them back for the earlier assistance.

3: If your medic is nearby and you are in need of healing try and stand still for a few seconds if possible. If the medic is not right next to you they will try to heal using their ranged syringe presuming they bought a medi gun. An erratically moving target is harder to hit than a stationary target.
