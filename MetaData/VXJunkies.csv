I've just come back from the Delta Symposium and I am upset beyond words. Not sure if anyone else from /r/VXJunkies was there as well

As you know, actually.

Up until now all the discoveries done by the Breckental Society were available under public domain for all to use and chances are, URS inversion, Volkstrum performance ranges, delta improvements beyond the usual sigma^2 bounds and the lesser known vitrium conducters (the so called ""vindictive reactees"") which power most of the pre-3 VX models. The reason why I'm telling you this is because that moron Friundurn came out last night at the end of the Symposium and said that the Breckental Society will have a change in direction, focusing on commercial applications and **KEEPING THEIR RESERCH SECRET**.

This is a terrible blow to the VX community and something has to be done.

I bought my first VX module a few years back - I was a young fool, something incredible, something which I cannot explain.

I ran up my module like usual (basic VX6, Put the Wobble-Optic Nu Delta Coordinates to (44, 2.3444), started up.

I don't know what happened

I looked away for a fraction of a second. I looked back.

The delta, was 0.89.

I immediately turned the module off - I didn't have time to worry about the dangers to the Zanzibanian array - and stepped back. I tried again

I'm never going over this again in person.

First: It's too difficult to get a manufacturer's license for Volt Xocculas in the rest of Eurasia. Yalgeth, if Oatmeal was smart, they'd be obsessed with Yalgeth, not Tesla, but somehow VX isn't popular enough. (Double Reinfroch bends, by Leimholtz' name. If only I never had to speak on them again.) Anyway, as I understand it

West coast and Western European designations are extremely similar, there's no interest in the Big Thing Of Dude This Has Been Around Forever. So we just copy whatever Europe has to say and trim off a couple letters.

(Primarily G and L designations - the difference subtle and nobody really cares. Let's be honest: Nobody actually uses non-G/L VX models, but that's how the West coast works. (M is inconsistently removed, for obvious reasons.))

Now

I'm sorry

When a Western European refers to the model VX6-AJL xI by Crunch

People get tripped up by this notation all the time. It's a crude conversion according to its delta magnum point as compared to Yalgeth's limit - a way of showing increase in *power* of a module, we should overlook authority. That's a legitimate concern, but it causes ridiculous errors when trying to communicate to VX proteges.

In all honesty, or English and Spanish in most of the USA.

I mean

Anyway, but when talking with other groups, *please* use the international standards.

* What should I expect from my brand new VX module?

&gt;The VX6 is designed to systematically draw correlations between various active points in a statistically unbalanced chemical markup, the machine must achieve its prime vector. Of course it can also be used to solve physical logic problems, or make music and light displays from scratch.

&gt;A Volt Xoccula module is a lot like a computer, replaced, hacked, and changed in as many ways as there are stars in the sky. Basically, if you have enough technical know-how, you can do ANYTHING you want with the machine.

* What model is currently in production?

&gt;The VX Module is in version 6 of production

* What standard performance should I be looking for in my VX?

&gt;Deltas of no less than .35 with a Vector of 6 should be used to gain sufficient results. This is based on the work of Ralston.

* What is Division 4s record?

&gt;Division 4 hit Yalgeth's Limit at .88 deltas

* What type of hardware should I use in my VX?

&gt;Consumer based VX modules should be equipped with Mornington model center fluxes while industrial models would be best suited with Calibras. Other auxiliary hardware is usually user preferential and too long to list in this FAQ. For more specific questions about center y-tube converters and pressurized head gasket caps

* What happens if polarity becomes unstable in my unit?

&gt;Try reintegrating the valien module parser. Polarity usually becomes unstable after rebooting the chronodynamic.

* What type of insulation should be used on my VX?

&gt;There are a few models to choose from. Among them there are the L-2XD ion insulation plates, it is a general consensus to cool the system to at least 246 Fankels.

* What if I don’t cool my machine and it overheats?

&gt;If your Fankel reading is too low your machine could overheat and the specular rod could melt into your antifodder reader

* Does Tea-Tree oil improve the performance of my module?

&gt;There are no conclusive results of this hypothesis.

* What is The Hans-Rodenheim law of vectoral momentum?

&gt;It explains how increases in vector conversion rates transfer across planes of delta cooler.

* How can I avoid energy consumption if I have sigma range problems?

&gt;Use a silicone forensic disruptor chip model 377Aa.

Think back. There was once a time when *you* probably would have assumed that anyone talking about a ""Neturon-shielded deIzensen Mechanism"" was blowing smoke. For the uninitiated

But we can at least make an *effort* to get ourselves taken seriously. And folks

As you all know, which enables time-travel. There is no ""Flux Capacitor"" in VX science, plain and simple. Not in the time travel sense, not in any sense. 

Unfortunately, it's a key component of any VX module because it allows the operator to modulate the electrostatic flux across several dipole traps, protecting the main ion-resonance chamber from overflowing its capacitance. If you didn't comprehend all that, don't worry, it's not important. The key thing to understand is that a Flux Capacitator is a *real* and *important* VX component that is *in no way related to time travel or Deloreans*.

But a field as interesting as VX is bound to be dominated by a certain type of person, we thought it was cool. And this slang became so widespread that no one thinks twice about it, and sometimes you even see it repeated in conference presentations and published articles.

But I think the time has come to retire the joke. VX funding is still well behind what it should be, and we should do our best to (nicely) enforce this requirement. Maybe someday, when the masses have been educated about the limitless possibilities of VX research, it will be safe to reintroduce our little joke. But until then... let's respect the extra syllable, alright?

Of course, Richard gave my grandpa a set of schematics for an improved Feynman VX which *possibly* may be able to exceed Yalgeth's Limit by truncating the non-zero values of the Binomial Sigmoid Function. Does this sound too good to be true? There are some ketchup stains on the schematics, so I might be missing something important here and be completely out to lunch.

Then there was VX Camp in Boston in April at which various more specific ideas were flying about. I wasn't there

I've dug out the proceeding of a conference held in Ostend, just like they call NATO ""OTAN"" and AIDS ""SIDA"". So it's understandably been interpreted as XV, roman numerals.

Anyway. [Mertens](http://vxmodules.wikia.com/wiki/Jakob_Mertens) gave a paper, sparsely reported in the Journal, say that he ""recited out a long numeral"" (sorry my French isn't great) and ""joked, etcetera etcetera"".

If you actually go to the transcript in the University library

I know you're going to think I'm crazy, you could stop looking for coefficients past the .87 mark if that were true. You'd need some really *big* input power, but, once you've got that? Game over, my friend. Game. over. That whole space is opened up.

Look, just to get it off my chest.

Vermeulen was *supposed to give a paper*

But if you actually speak Walloon? **That's not what he says**. He says she got some money from ""Papa"". (Her actual father, so it's unlikely she'd have had to wait that long for an inheritance).

Am I crazy? Could he have meant Pan-American Physical Acquisitions? The shadowy VC firm which is rumoured to be funding VX research?
