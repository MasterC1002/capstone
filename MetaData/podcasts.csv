Today two congressional reps are unveiling the SHIELD Act -- and it could help protect all podcasters, LLC.  This is very real. This could seriously put a stop to your favorite show.

We'll be broadcasting live throughout the day on Earwolf Radio, and friends a place to voice their opinions on this and ask listeners to support the SHIELD Act. 

We'd like you to help. Please spread the word. Please go to www.eff.org/shield to contact
your representative and tell them to make the SHIELD Act law.

Thanks for your continued support!

Here is more information on the issue:

-Patent trolls are companies who don’t make anything or don’t sell anything

-President Obama recently said that patent trolls are those who “do
not produce anything themselves” and are “trying to leverage and
hijack someone else's idea and see if they can extort some money out
of them.”

-This is really a big problem. It’s not just podcasters who have been
targeted. App developers have been on the hook for using “click to
upgrade” functions
have been targeted
access to wifi.

-Two members of Congress
Chaffetz
for these patent trolls. The bill
to pay the other side's costs and fees when they lose. We need to make the
troll business model less attractive so companies like Personal Audio leave
podcasters alone.

-We support this legislation. So should you. Go to www.eff.org/shield to contact
your representative and tell them to make the SHIELD Act law.",,t5_2qh1d,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/19cjw1/hi_its_earwolf_this_is_urgent_podcasting_needs/

I have several goals and the first one is to get input from you.

If you have any interest in /r/podcasts then please upvote this post **and** comment. Please comment even if you have nothing to say

Let me know if you have any concerns or requests or advise.

I promise to deal as quickly as possible with any new posts that get caught in the **spam filter**. Don't hesitate to send me a PM if you think your post has been filtered. Warning: please **never delete a post** because I have heard that deleting reinforces the spam filter (if it thought your post was spam then deleting your post makes it more certain that posts like yours are spam).

------------------------------------------

I want to add some features to the sidebar. No promises and no deadlines; however

(1) a **FAQ**

(2) a list of all **related subreddits**: bestpodcasts, lolcast, ...; including a section where podcasts are likely to be mentioned (as observed by metareddit's monitor feature)

(3) a link to a **list of podcasters** who promote their new episodes here with relevant information about their podcast

(4) a link to **reviews** of podcasts and/or podcast episodes made by redditors

(5) **podcast rankings**

* based on people voting for their favorite

* based on people submitting a list of the podcasts they subscribe to

* categories such as: open to any podcast

(6) a **New Visitor** survey intended to find out why somebody came to /r/podcasts and what might cause them to return.

(7) a **regular visitor survey** (I'd say subscribers but there is no way to know who is or is not a subscriber): who are you, etc.

(8) **activity statistics** (there are almost endless possibilities of the stats that can be collected but what would be interesting to visitors to /r/podcasts?)

Note: I hope to use Google Docs surveys to simplify and automate many of these features.

Fortunately I know a thing or two about web development

- You can search for podcasts using the search bar.
- On podcast pages
- For every item in your queue
- You can add podcasts to your favorites so that you can access them quickly. Your favorites page also shows you a list of the most recent episodes from your favorites.
- You can rewind/forward in 15-second increments just like in Apple's iOS app.
- Podcast playback will not be interrupted when you navigate to other pages on the site. I'm using some HTML5 wizardry to make this happen.
- You can get a link to a certain time in an episode so that your friends don't have to manually download the MP3 file and skip to that moment in the podcast.

10)  [**Totally Laime**](http://www.totallylaime.com/)- An interview podcast from the home of comedy writer Elizabeth Laime and music producer Andrew Rosen, so if you don't find them charming you may have a hard time keeping interested.

Top Episode- http://www.totallylaime.com/2012/08/10/episode-132-jon-lajoie/

9) [**Mental Illness Happy Hour**](http://mentalpod.com/)- Comedian/depressive Paul Gilmartin hosts what is arguably the most unique comedy podcast available, such as molestation and suicide. Gilmartin sees the podcast as a social service and it serves as a community for the depressed, anxious and lonely. There are plenty of moments of humor to offer some levity but the openness of the guests is the core of this fantastic podcast.

Top Episode- http://mentalpod.com/Teresa-Strasser-podcast-fixed

8) [**The Long Shot Podcast**](http://allthingscomedy.com/channels/4/the-long-shot-podcast)- Hosts Eddie Pepitone, with the former two being established comedy scene stalwarts and the latter two relatively new to comedy. However the battering that Jamie receives from Sean and Eddie provides endless entertainment and Amber's laugh and personality balance out the aggressiveness of the interaction between the other three. There is usually a comedian guest and topic of the day.

Top Episode-http://allthingscomedy.com/contents/1338/4-episode-%23608%3A-the-mailbag-strikes-back-episode-podcast

7) [**Professor Blastoff**](http://www.earwolf.com/show/professor-blastoff/)- Tig Notaro has had [a hell of a year](http://www.vulture.com/2012/12/tig-notaro-talks-about-her-crazy-year.html) and it's a testament to her and her relationship with co-hosts David Huntsberger and Kyle Dunnigan that the show has remained light and hilarious. Professor Blastoff is a science/comedy podcast where a knowledgeable guest expounds on a topic while the three comedians interrupt and mock the guest and each other. David and particularly Kyle are underrated talents and together with Tig provide a likable threesome with an endless line of sharp critiques and the occassional insight into the topic of the day which is always superseded by the comedy crosstalk.

Top Episode- http://www.earwolf.com/episode/gravity/

5)[**Doug Loves Movies**](http://douglovesmovies.com/)- Comedian Doug Benson is at his funniest on this trivia podcast where actors and comedians play a movie version of Name That Tune based on the cast listing. Despite his reputation as a 'pot comedian'

Top Episode- Guests Chris Evans

4) [**The JV Club**](http://www.nerdist.com/podcast/the-jv-club/)- Improv Comedian/HuffPost Live Host/Legend of Korra voice actor Janet Varney hosts a women only podcast that digs into the guests' upbringings to reveal the commonalities and fascinating differences between our life paths. It's comparable to a lighter version of Gilmartin's Mental Illness Happy Hour, and hilarious moments for everyone.

It's a testament to the show that I personally find Pete slightly annoying yet look forward to new episodes more than any other podcast.

Stuff You Should Know is good sometimes. Stuff You Missed In Histroy Class is OK but I find the girls to sound annoying sometimes.

**Cracking down on spam**

Us mods have been discussing measures to deal with the issue of spam posts and the need to uphold [Reddit's rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/)

&gt;""Don't spam. [–] What is spam? NOT OK: Submitting only links to your blog or personal website. OK: Submitting links from a variety of sites and sources. OK: Submitting links from your own site

**""What does this mean?""**

We've got a lot of people posting on /r/podcasts who only ever post links to their podcasts when on Reddit

**""But how will we promote our podcasts?""**
There will be a daily new episodes text post for people to reply to with links and descriptions of their latest episodes

We'll also be beefing up the Wiki (i.e. adding one)

**""But this is my first podcast episode.""**
Don't meet the minimum episode count for the directory submissions form? It's cool, but if you follow these steps you will be more likely to get some.

**""I really want some feedback/advice and my podcast has been going for a while.""**

And you're welcome to post a text post asking for this as above.

**""When are links okay?""**

Found a decent article or video or presentation or whatever on podcasting and want to share it? Then it's okay to post it as a link

*BUT* if people continue to spam with links to their podcasts after 22 April


**Other changes**

The sidebar will be altered to reflect these changes in the near future.

We also finally hope to include a FAQ on podcasting in our new Wiki.

**Summary**

* We'll be truly cracking down on spam
* We're going to start posting a daily text post where people will be able to post links to their new episodes
* A new Wiki is being created and it is going to include a directory of podcasts submitted by the community
* The new Wiki will aim to have a FAQ on podcasting (ideas for resources to include are welcome)
* Link posts that are not promotional are okay
* You're still welcome to ask for feedback
* If people continue to post spammy link posts
* EDIT: you'll still be welcome to ask for podcast listening suggestions.

The rules can be found at [The /r/podcasts FAQ](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/podcasts#rules).

Most of this is standard procedure: no flagrantly racist or sexist comments, etc... The main thing I want to bring your attention to is: 

**No linking directly to the audio file for your podcast**. 

We feel that /r/podcasts works best when it helps listeners find new podcasts or connects podcast creators. However, or even look for more podcasts from the same person. For this reason we feel you should be required to at least provide some basic website or blog where your podcast is linked from, or at least use a self post where you can describe your podcast before linking to it.

We of course welcome feedback from the community on this rule, as of now, if any audio files are posted, they will be removed and a message will be left for the user informing them that audio file posts are not allowed and asking them to submit again when they can link to a website, blog, YouTube page or some other source.

Since it's okay to promote your own podcast I also hope you are okay with me making a little plug for my own pet-project.

For the last couple of months I've been working on a podcast client for Android. The motivation has been the lack of a really good client. Since I started working Pocket Casts 4 was released and actually delivered a lot of the things I originally intended to solve. However

The goal is to make a really good podcast client which **always** put the user first and doesn't collect any strange data

Here are some bullet points.

* Free and Open Source
* No ads
* Privacy aware. I does not spy on you in any way.[1]
* Cross device syncing
* Easy playlist sorting
* Import old Google Listen feeds from Google Reader (for the next week or two at least :) )
* And just a nice look&amp;feel in general

The todo list is long an ambitious but now I just working on getting it to a stable state. However

The state of the app *is* a bit rough today

You can get the beta-version from the play store by joining the google+ community (required by Google
And you can get the source and some screenshots (slightly outdated) here: https://github.com/bottiger/SoundWaves

If you are interested in helping me out please install it and give me all the feedback you can. Most crashes should be reported automatic

I'm a big fan of Ricky Gervais and Steven Merchant. I've listened to all of their podcasts (*The Ricky Gervais Show* and *The Ricky Gervais' Guide to...*) and I found them very enjoyable - this type of talk show / comedy is exactly what I'm after.

Additionally, from ancient history, psychedelics and aliens to modern-day 'gossip' and martial arts, but in a very informal 'in-my-own-living-room"" fashion.

So those are the types of shows I like to listen to - not overly formal, not too much about (American) politics.

The hope is that users will offer constructive criticism and write reviews for those shows on iTunes.

A few rules:

* You need to have your show listed in the [Podcast Directory](http://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/wiki/communitypodcasts) to be selected
*  Moving forward we will only select shows if someone from the show has offered feedback or written reviews for another show (It would be helpful if you updated your flair to highlight which show you're on)
* The feedback offered must be constructive.
* If you write a review on iTunes
* For the sake of transparency: we will not include moderator-produced shows.

Essentially, other members of the community. This is new, so please contact me or /u/milliways86 if you have feedback.

My biggest goal is to just find a way to reach as many podcasters and artists and just work together on a site that has an interesting name and create something others can enjoy. If you have any questions feel free to PM me or [contact me though the site](http://everythingsucks.net/contact).

**TL;DR**: I own a website and would love to work with any and all podcasters to form a network.

Basically the idea would be to use this subreddit to match up similar podcasts to exchange plugs or promos and by doing so help each other build our shows audiences and create networking opportunities for podcasters. Also it would be a good way of using this subreddit for promotion that wasn't just posting links to the latest episode.

This could be done a few ways. Here are a few ideas I had as to how to do this
*I create thread for this in which someone could post a comment with a link to their podcast and a short description and then someone who wanted to trade plugs could reply with their intrest and their own link and description. On the next episode of their podcasts both users would tell their listeners about the other one's podcast. There is no reason only two users could participate in this.
*Each plug request gets its own thread. The title could start with something like [Plug Swap]. Inside the post the OP could provide the link and description. Other users could post comments with their own description

Both of these ideas could also work with promos as well.

I think option two would be the easiest to manage and a good way to keep each plug swap going as long as it had legs. I think it would encourage many people to get involved in each swap and be a good way of creating networking opportunities between podcasters with similar topics for their shows.

I appreciate any help/ advice anyone can offer about getting this started.

NSFRadio is an online radio station and podcast network focused on bringing together some of the best in independent talk and comedy podcasts. NSFRadio will be launching in July/August and we hope to have a full slate of awesome podcasts.

Currently NSFRadio is comprised of Too Fat Dudez(TooFatDudez.podomatic.com), but as you can imagine we’re looking for more podcasts to help us fill out our 24/7 format. We’re looking for shows with a reliable release schedule who want to be a part of our online radio network.

We’re also looking for people who would enjoy to do a live show format as well

What’s in it for you? Free advertising

What’s in it for NSFRadio? The chance to build a really awesome channel around some very interesting and funny podcasts and live radio shows. There won’t be advertising on the channel (at least channel-branded

If we grow to a certain size where perhaps a way to monetize is possible or needed (such as advertising or something)

It includes information on how to not be a spammer and the signs of when you've been shadowbanned.

**New wiki**

That's right the wiki is ALIVE! Including a [new directory section with podcast listings](http://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/wiki/communitypodcasts).

**From April 22**

We really don't want to see any more link posts that are directly to your podcast, but check the wiki for what.

**IF** people continue to post link posts to their podcasts come April 29

**The future of the downvote button**

I'll let you know tomorrow what the verdict is on that.

Some things that don't seem to work for us:

* flyers and cards (I use trackable QR codes to trace where our listeners come from)
* tweeting about it (I've build up a following of around 800 followers on Twitter
* SEO of our website www.wearethedevilsadvocates.com - it's pretty well SEO'd at this point and comes up pretty high in searches

Things that do work:

* Google AdWords. I get definite clicks through to our site and itunes page, but it does work.
* Facebook page- our page, not cheap for that. maybe you can build it with just your built in social network.

During the last 7 days I have sent out 47 messages to people who have posted link posts for their episodes

Admittedly some have responded well to the requests and have said that they didn't know the rules had changed, clearly looking to get some quick traffic to their podcasts, with the link post being their first ever post.

It would have been far easier for me to have personally marked all these posts as spam and doomed them to the modqueue and the path of shadowbanning

So

* Remove link post option on /r/podcasts

* Keep link posts

1375037226.0,1j87n8,Fighting with audio problems on our podcast and looking for some advice,itatton,8,0,8,"We've got a small podcast with 4 primary hosts and sometimes up to 8-10 people (which I know and understand is chaos).  I'm really struggling with trying to keep everyone leveled properly.  The nature of our show is just capturing unscripted/unprompted discussion/conversation/debates and I've got two issues

* Hardware - I've got 4 XLR mics and 4 1/8in jack random mics.  I know I need to replace 3 of the 1/8in ones because they are things like Xbox or Singstar mics.  The mics run into an R-1604FX Wharfdale which run into an iMic and then into the Macbook.  For whatever reason

* The conversation levels - Like I mentioned before, but I still have to ride the board for pretty much the whole show and even then we still top out a lot when people get excited.  Does anyone have any experience with this type of format that could either offer some advice or point me towards some decent learning materials online?

I would ask that you provide an mp3 link to the episode that you feel is a good representation of what kind of podcast you do. 

I will probably only do about 10 to 15 reviews and post the feedback on wednesday (my day off) but I will listen to all episodes between now and then.

I am willing to listen to any type of podcast

I request that some people volunteer to keep the spam filter clear. Ideally at least one person would check the mod queue every few hours (everyday year round). It only takes a minute

Of course you must be a moderator before you can see the mod queue and once you are a moderator there is almost no limit to the changes you can make :) You do not have to do anything and you will have the ability to do many things. Including such things as try to disable the down-vote button (apparently something people have discussed recently).

I hesitate to give moderator privileges to somebody that I know nothing about. Therefore

------------------

When I became a mod many months ago I had many ideas that I wanted to implement. However

If you want to become a mod just to help keep the spam filter clear then fantastic. If you want to become a mod and implement some ideas that you have then I encourage you. If you like some of the ideas that I wanted to implement and you would like to try to implement them but don't know how then I would be willing to try to explain how I was planning to do it.

The ideas that have been started are:

* I wanted a FAQ and fortunately Ytoabn became a mod and he did most of the work on the FAQ. Obviously there is much more that could be done with the FAQ and reddit ADMIN have made some changes to the system so the FAQ probably needs some attention.

* I created the Welcome Survey and I have been surprised at the continuous stream of responses (over 140 in 4 months and more every day) and I find some of the things people say quite interesting.

* I did some preliminary work on the ""Podcasts Actively Promoted"" idea and I am still getting positive responses to the idea (see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/10f5c5/if_you_promote_a_podcast_on_rpodcasts_then_please/). One person contacted me and they might be interested in working on implementing this; I am waiting to hear from them as they had some real life issues get in the way.

---

Here's your chance to get a podcast you liked noticed by all of Reddit. Here is how it works:

---

1. Redditors leave a comment with a link to a post in /r/podcasts made in the last week.

2. Redditors also upvote any podcasts in the comments they think are good.

3. At the end of 24 hours, will be linked on the sidebar.

---

Here are the rules:

---

**1. YOU CANNOT LINK TO YOUR OWN POST / PODCAST!!!**

I want to put emphasis on this point. In the end most of the posts on /r/podcasts will always focus on self promotion as podcast creators post their own stuff and try to get attention, please do not use the Podcast of the Week to promote your own podcast. Instead, focus on making good posts throughout the week when promoting your own podcast, and then hopefully a fan of yours will nominate your podcast for Podcast of the Week.

.2. You need to nominate a post that was made in the last week. It is Podcast of the Week after all.

.3. After a podcast has won Podcast of the Week

It could be a good way for everyone to be exposed to new ideas and also just see what everyone else is doing on their shows.

Share clips of some of your regular segments or examples of topics that you enjoy/work on your podcast. Everyone feel free to give feedback on each other's clips.

1374655238.0,1iy1mc,"""Can you use Dropbox for podcasting?"" I finally have an answer to this",milliways86,8,3,2,"The answer is **yes you can**

### Why the concern?
[Yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/1ivo8l/ive_decided_to_change_where_i_host_my_podcasts/) I was talking about how I'm switching from Dropbox due to concerns over their Acceptable Use Policy and the cost.

This all started out from a conversation with another poster on here

We debated the ToS and Acceptable Use Policy of the service. Apparently he'd tried contacting Dropbox before over whether a key piece of wording over Dropbox's acceptable use

&gt; You agree not to misuse the Dropbox services. For example, use the services to do the following things.[...] access or search the Services by any means other than our publicly supported interfaces (for example, “scraping”);

### But does this apply to RSS and podcasting?
So

Guess what? They got back to me.

Here's how I explained [the use of Dropbox](http://i.imgur.com/lTEvCyO.png) and RSS for podcasting

[Here is a pic](http://i.imgur.com/9OZgZZk.png) of the email reply I got back from their support team *after* contacting their legal team by email. And for those who don't want to click:

&gt; Creating RSS links to content you shared would not constitute scraping.
&gt; Looking for content that matches a pattern to find content that you did not share would constitute scraping.

There you have it. 

**You can use Dropbox for podcasting, one thing you need to keep in mind...**

### There's still limits on use
There is a [daily bandwidth limit](https://www.dropbox.com/help/45/en) on your files being accessed. It is different for free accounts in comparison to Pro and Business:

* Free has a limit of 20 GB a day
* Pro and Business have a limit of 200GB a day

So

### Am I going to go back to Dropbox?
No. The new provider I've now gone with is a far cheaper option and has less confusing policies in place

I'll be including a version of this post in the FAQ once I've finally finished compiling the basics.",,t5_2qh1d,1374661757.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/1iy1mc/can_you_use_dropbox_for_podcasting_i_finally_have/

After not finding any clarification on Dropbox over their use of the term ""scraping"" and other parts of their Acceptable Usage policy I'm now hosting my files with another cloud storage provider.

After checking about both AWS and Rackspace, is still very low (I'm unlikely to be hitting anything near £5 a month) and their support seems pretty good.

Also - not that difficult to set up and lots of knowledge documents.

1374525367.0,1iu4t9,Question for those who interview a guest regularly,bluepisces,7,4,17,"So

Anyways

The entire interview is only 55 minutes long. (and to wit

Fortunately, or 3 hour interview, sure, 3 chunks would make some sense. But it's a podcast. They tend to range 30-90 minutes on average, and to really give a good overview/in depth look at an issue or business or idea, I think you need AT LEAST 30 minutes, but the style I'm going for is between suited to 30-60. People who are used to the radio obviously don't have that attention span

Anyways, because organizations DO have a public image to maintain and do have some say in how their information is presented. It kind of reminds me of what Morgan Spurloch dealt with while make ""the greatest movie ever sold"" when the sponsors started to throw their muscle around and he felt he was losing creative control of his project. Obviously this isn't that bad, but the logistics of managing it are such that I really don't want anything to do with it, given the choice. It is an early lesson learned in ""what sorts of organizations would I like to interview, but that the PR gymnastics after the fact might make it not worth the trouble?"".

I kind of think that maybe just trying to interview individuals

Problems I'm running into after I've created the Aggregate Device in Garageband and then applied each mic to its own track.

-The people running off the USB hub cannot hear the main mix in their headphones
-If all three mics are plugged into the USB hub

I'm guessing that both of those are USB power problems? As in I have to plug directly into the MPB instead of the hub

So

For our site www.goodatstudios.us we use wordpress as our backbone for the site and use feedburner to create a podcast friend rss feed for itunes.  

The only reason why I can truly say I do it this way is for the listens.  I feel when a user wants to listen to our show they have a one stop shop while visiting our site. We have iTunes Link

Plus... I only only have to update one title

I'll see some sites that are set up for their podcast but don't have anything on there... and as a listener I think to myself... this is confusing that you brought me here but there's nothing for me... now I have to be directed to a different site.

Nothing to outrageous, I like how Rogan keeps it pretty simple and breaks shit down into laymen's terms for his listeners after his guests go way out there with some shit, Rogan brings them back down to Earth a bit for his listeners.

But I am pretty much out of Podcasts to listen to of his.  I have one last one that I started last night that I have about 2 hours left that I will probably finish tonight when I go to bed.  But tomorrow I am gonna need something new to listen to.  So any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Feedback was positive and encouraging

Redditors seem to come to /r/podcasts for 3 reasons:

* to promote their podcast (or one they are associated with)

* to try to find good new podcasts to listen to

* to interact with podcast creators

Some come for just 1 of the 3 reasons

A few do not plan to come back because of the lack of activity and the large number of un-voted

Many of those who promote want to learn how to be more effective at attracting new listeners.

Blue Microphones Icicle XLR to USB Mic Converter/Mic Preamp X2

Nady MPF-6 6-Inch Clamp On Microphone Pop Filter  X2

Samson SP01 Shockmount Spider Mount for Condenser MicsX2

----------------------

As moderator I want to facilitate and encourage the /r/podcasts community to flourish. I do not want to restrict and dictate or do anything else that might stifle the community. Please remind me of this if I behave inappropriately.

This is reddit, and comment features to try to influence other community members. At the end of the day, any redditor can create their own subreddit and configure it which ever way they want. I might even subscribe to your subreddit and actively participate!!!

-------------------------

I am aware of the following objections to **any** (links or selfs):

* Podcast promoters can (and do) dump a link to their latest episode or website with no further information. Most of those posts do not seem to receive any votes (up or down) and no comments. Why do the promoters bother? Why would the community want these kind of posts? Its annoying!

* Unlike other subreddits

* Why can't they be forced to use self only because it is trivial for them to put their link in the self text area?

-------------------------

I am aware of the following objections to **self only** (no links):

* Podcast creators would rather spend their valuable time creating amazing podcast content. Link posts are much easier. The link points to a huge amount of information to help people who might be interested in the podcast. Taking the time to make a self post and include information that attracts potential listeners has not helped in the past. And what reason would they have to think that it would help now?

* This is reddit. If you don't like link posts then ignore them. If you want to get aggressive (and some might say mean) then down vote link posts into oblivion. Why should you be able to dictate what others can or can not do? Go create your own subreddit.

-----------------------

Perhaps I can try to manipulate you. I fear that this issue might polarize the community. I'm loosing sleep over it. I have a huge water blister on my foot from pacing back and forth trying to figure out how to deal with the crucial issue. My wife is about to leave me. My mistress says that I don't get her off any more. I can't focus on pictures of attractive images so my internal plumbing is plugged up and it is starting to stink around here. But worst of all it is taking all my attention away from working on the sidebar FAQ

Another my partner listens to is Ben glebb ... I tried listening but couldn't get used to a one man show ... 

I used to be an avid listener to joe rogans show but just kinda stopped... Dunno why.  

Twit is a decent show for tech biz updates if you're into that too

* You can get up-to-the-minute segments from many popular music and news stations (NPR, MPR: The Current, Idobi Radio, etc).
* You can share the radio segments over FB and twitter (clumsily at the moment).
* You can mix and match shows into a custom RSS feed.
* You can get shows before the podcast is released

I need some beta testers to help me find errors and suggest features. Hopefully you
