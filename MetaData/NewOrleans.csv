So somebody starts pounding on this door like their goddamn life depends on it. I mean


I go walking back there and open it (not my smartest moment) and there's this little 90lb greasy haired tweaker white dude standing there asking for food. I tell him to go away and he tells me he has a ""right"" to come in and get food because we're a ""church"" and he's hungry. For those of you who don't know what I do for a living... I do not run a church.


I look passed him


So a couple of minutes later, TT is in the passenger seat screaming at him about how ""she hungry"" and he needs to ""do something useful with his white ass"" and get the car fixed. I tell him I can't help him and slam the door.


About 10 more minutes go by and now I'm curious. I walk over to a window and TT is outta the car beating the crap out of tweaker dude with her purse. She seems me looking at her, and down the sidewalk. So I'm standing there slack-jawed in amazement that a woman that size can run that fast when I notice this chick has no shoes, and no bra. And those big 'ol titties are flyin everywhere.


About another ten minutes go by and catch a glimpse of a truck (a little Ford Ranger) driving through the lot

These dudes head back over to the car, start cutting all the seat belts out of the car. I can't figure out what the fuck they're doing until they tie one end under the car and other end to the bumper of the pickup - so there's basically this ""rope"" made out of five or six tied together seat belts. This guy gets in the truck, and fucking floors it. The chain of seat belts immediately snaps and the truck shoots across the parking lot. So being that the definition of stupidity is doing the same thing multiple times and expecting different results, these guys try this 10 more times with their chain of tied together seat belts getting progressively shorter. Eventually there's like a foot of space between two bumpers, this guy gives it another try and it actually holds. 


So this dude in the truck is so damn impressed with himself that he does the only logical thing and slams on the fucking brakes


TL;DR Fucking New Orleans.

7712 Plum St - Also nearly non-existent insulation, still managing to leave a huge mess and all of his tools behind. took almost 45 days to refund security deposit, but then caused me to seek him out because he had not signed the check.

930 Poydras - This architect (Wayne Troyer) is the Anna Kournikova of the architectural world in New Orleans; looks great but functionally useless. (EDIT: I was confused by nearly identical features in the two Troyer buildings I had previously stayed in and this one, which really fucks with you after a while. The building is infested with slimy BP employees who drag their glutted selves around with airs of extreme arrogance and self-importance, and the 300+lb one that lived above me would often use a vibrator on himself, which I could hear and *feel* through the ceiling, walls, and floor. Phantom beeping would often permeate through the walls and my sleep was frequently and violently disrupted by helicopters flying around and explosions going off around us during the filming of movies. Speaking of which, the building itself is often used to film in and residents are often barred from entering their own living space at their convenience. There are few things worse than coming home from a long, sterile white and the floors (and ceilings) are nothing but bare concrete, directly in the path of the door-track. The brand new, completely fucking with my work uniform

1424 Dauphine St. - I could write a small book about my stay here. By far the most tyrannical control freak I've ever encountered in my life. This man would frequently dictate to me what temperature I should keep my air-con on (he said 72 was too cold and 74 was more appropriate during the New Orleans summer) even though I paid the bills and he lived in a separate building. He would call me several times a week leaving cryptic, which for some reason he though I was a part of (even though I kept my bike inside my apartment). He would subtly verbally abuse his wife in front of the other tenants, which was very uncomfortable for all of us, and also felt the need to lecture me on which floor I should set up my bed, and got upset that I couldn't afford more furniture. Took him over a month and a half to refund my deposit. 

ArtEggs Studios - Internet services were offline for sometimes a week a a time (which makes it hard to conduct business), but that was a lie. Landlady withheld entire security deposit ($500) because she claimed the re-paint-job was inadequate (it's an art studio and I invited my girlfriend to freestyle paint over the horribly sterile white walls). She has refused to provide receipts for this job and will not return any correspondences. I also know for a fact that she outsources her maintenance work to sketchy contractors who do half-assed jobs.  

The more you know.

House Bill 103 reduces penalties and incarceration time for those convicted more than once of possessing marijuana

Specifically

My best friend was stopped at the light when a small silver car with a Florida license plate hit the back of her and then sped off. The driver was a female with light colored blonde-ish hair. My best friend's car is TOTALED. Her back windshield is gone and her trunk is pretty much in her back seat. The impact pushed the rear end of her car into her tires so she was not able to follow the woman.

Whoever was driving, or a rental car, or a tow truck to get her to a shop. She has to have damaged her engine, ESPECIALLY after speeding off like she did after such an impact.

My New Orleans habits and attitude have got me in trouble a few times and also helped to make new friends. I almost got arrested in Taos Ski Village in New Mexico for open container

I am fairly close with a number of major players in the outdoor community in  New Orleans and I am hoping to act as an ambassador on this trip. I would love to come back to the city and help people realize the outdoor recreation possibilities that can be accessed in the South East. New Orleans is surrounded by water and when I am home all I do is canoe touring. I want to bring these experiences to all of you guys. if your interested in outdoor recreation let me know. I have tons of experience.

I went to Tulane for my first semester of college in the Fall of 2012

Although I'm free to go back when I'm able (Spring 2014) without hassle

I **love** New Orleans.  I think it's a magical place.  However

My entire dorm was either not to be seen or out getting blackout drunk most days of the week

I bought a tour book from Barnes and Noble (""Frommer's Guide"") with which I was gonna explore the culture of the city

I wanted to have intellectual conversations

I met a friend who was going to play jazz with me in the Quarter

Et cetera.

It really really sucked.  The irony is that New Orleans is such a cool place

I tried really hard, which isn't normal or healthy.

So it is with great pain that I say goodbye.  I don't think I'd be able to do well academically while being so depressed about my social situation.

STILL responding to PMs


--------------------------------------


**ETA1:** 
First, so the oldest PMs were ignored after the few this AM.


Second


Sometime in July/August


Third


So so so sorry I can't respond to everyone's PMs right away


--------------------------------------


Dear all


In the wake of the horrible assault that occurred near my neighborhood this past February


**Me:**


As I stated in that post, so I honestly wouldn't want an influx of business. Someday, I truly hope I can teach without charging for it, as I want everyone in this city to have the *option* to defend themselves if needed.


**The Course (6/9


I took my concealed weapons permit training course in Florida almost 10 years ago, and all of them sat silently while the 'instructor' droned through the standard NRA lecture materials for several hours. Upon lecture completion, we took our 'live fire exam' - we loaded two powderless/primer-fired (i.e., probably no more powerful than a BB gun) .22 rounds into a revolver, shot them into a shoe box about 6 feet away, unloaded, and then passed the course.  Afterwards, we got a sermon/sales pitch from our instructor to join his church (and I won't name the controversial denomination that it was) in addition to some pamphlets about going to hell. 


I figure that this is a solid curriculum to replicate; mixing an efficient lecture devoid of time-wasting class participation with an easy-to-take test, I **did**, in fact, base my syllabus on that course I took 10 years ago.  That is, I wanted my course to be the complete and total opposite of that farce of a course *that was supposed to teach you how to use a deadly weapon against other human beings.*  Sadly, most courses are like this. Louisiana is better because the requirements here are quite stringent vis-a-vis the contents of the lecture and the testing methods, but even so, and it is typically taught in a diploma-mill


My course goes like this: 


* Eight people tops
* Lecture on safety, and whatever else you want to talk about at greater length (this is usually gear or legal issues).
* An as-comfortable-as-I-can-make-it range session including a rehash of the technique
* An ""improved"" version of the LA state required live-fire test, after my course, no one of my students has *ever* failed the 'improved' test - not even close!)
* Completely devoid of religious or political discussion.


Essentially, you have the bedrock to base future practice on, the knowledge of how your gun/a gun works, and you can hit a man size target from 25 feet away (under ideal conditions, so don't get a false sense of security from that last part -  practice, practice, practice). You will also have a certificate that will allow you to get your LA CCW permit (assuming all other prerequisites are met


I am only planning one course for now. Depending on its success and feedback from the students from this group


**YOU:**


OK


FIRST, you'll need a special reason for me to teach you for free.  Note: I may ask my wife to attend the course so I look like less of a creep/this ends up being an all-women class.


**Please do not take this course if you just want a free CCW**. Please. 


You cover your own costs (basically range fees and ammo)


**SECOND**


Send me a PM with ALL the following info:

1) Your email address;
2) Your age (you can ballpark it to a decade if you feel more comfortable
3) Your firearms experience level
4) A short note on why you want to take the course.


There are a lot of reasons I want this information


**Finally


I realize this is a polarizing topic, many anti-gunners are essentially, anti-gunpeople to one extent or another, and not necessarily anti-gun. Having worked in the gun industry for almost a decade, I will tell you that gunpeople can be jerks, and their macho, hyper-republican, ""if you don't like it you can git out"" bullshit has generally ruined the public's perception of gun owners. I get it. I am not that. This is an educational course,"" you are going to have a good time


OK, please communicate that respectfully and I will return in kind (no pun).


I can send you to my personal webpage if you want to check my creds or see if there is something you are interested in

I say screw it and start walking to my own house. This walk now just got longer than I had anticipated. I was expecting to get mugged or jumped

WHEN OUT OF THE BLUE and I shit you not -- some girl decked out in running clothes turns the same corner as I am in the opposite direction and we bump in to each other. 

She literally asks me where I'm headed. . . I point where I'm going. . . she says she's going the same way. . . and asks if I'd like to run with her.

This seemed like a good idea at the time, just light conversation. I don't really know where this was at the time, somewhere in the general uptown area around Touro perhaps.

My legs are still sore even today. And I just need to know if I dreamt all of this up. Which I am 90% sure I did not.

* If Hurricane Katrina is mentioned at any point during the RNC by a Republican OR a newscaster

* If a Republican complains about not enough federal aid being sent to Louisiana for Isaac, restart the game again, and take two shots.

From thatbox:

* When Cox fails before Entergy

* Every time a Republican uses a dog whistle term to disparage the racial makeup of New Orleans

* If a Republican rails against federal spending and calls for increased support to New Orleans or stronger levees in the same speech

* If a Republican who has previously demanded budget offsetting for disaster aid calls for disaster aid without naming a cut

I know plenty of other cities are getting active and getting involved and I was wondering if anyone knew of one or would be willing to help me get one started for our city. 

The government has gone too far this time and we can not keep sitting by and letting our right be taken away. So if anyone has suggestions as to what we can do to make our voice be heard speak up and let's get this organized.

Edit: Well I assumed I was getting involved in this late but turns out I was pretty early. We are getting everything more organized in /r/restorethefourth and the IRC channels. We have started to work on design and other publicity gaining mechanisms such as the #restorethe4th hash on twitter and using *[this](http://i.imgur.com/UqUmNKX.jpg)* as a facebook profile to spread the word on social media. I am designing a trifold brochure and will hopefully have that complete by the end of the day today. 
I would like to point out I am only 22 and really haven't been involved in any protest so I have no idea what I am doing so if anyone who has more experience wants to help me out that would be awesome
Any questions or suggestions please feel free to PM me.

I don't know his birthday or anyone else he is related to. I don't know if he's still in the New Orleans area.

She was telling me about a man named Jimmy who she went on 3 dates with back when she was 20ish. She was saying how he was one of the only people who truly made her laugh and they had a natural banter. She said they connected immediately and had a great time each time they were together. At the time she was dating my grandfather and was in love with him, I would like to find him. 

I'm not sure what my goal in the long run is

She doesn't know his last name or where he went to high school

In brief, is James):
-He should be about 72 now
-From New Orleans
-Either owned a sail boat when he was younger or had access to one at the Yacht Club
-He rode in one of the truck parades that followed Rex (either Elks or Orleanians)
- Soon after he dated my grandmother he dated a woman name Peggy Mcinerney for two years

So I guess I'm looking for one of y'alls fathers or grandfathers. The only information I'm going to give out about my grandmother is that her name is Alice and she went to Sacred Heart. 

I may be able to find out his last name through a great aunt. If I do I'll update.

Here's to long lost love.

UPDATE: His last name is Waters. Jimmy Waters.

UPDATE 2: He was born in 1940. They knew each other in 57-58",,t5_2qhp5,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/rqm2k/i_know_this_is_a_long_shot_but_can_you_help_me/

**TL;DR, and I want to buy the kid a new tuba.  But I have no idea how to find him.**

I was sitting down getting a nice buzz with my in laws and all that and after watching band after band

But I suck as a human

As fate would have it, and WHILE STILL PLAYING, tried to take a beat off his neck and give it to the kid.  The bead got hung up on his tuba, and I could see him getting frustrated about it.  Rather than just saying ""screw it, too bad kid"", he kept persevering while playing and got the beads off.  By the time he did, the kid had already calmed down, nor the parents realized this kid was giving them beads to the child because he was crying.

My heart broke watching this

So

**Find me sources of pictures or video**.  Nothing listed here (yet):  http://www.mardigrasparadeschedule.com/krewes/thoth/
Nola.com only has like 10 pictures.  

Most of the stuff I saw on Youtube (understandably) focuses on the floats and dancers

**Identify what group/band he was in**
I saw this guy's pictures on Flickr - I THINK this may have been their attire:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/rigolphotography/8466544173/in/photostream.  But if that's the Irish Channel Corner Club, so it may have not been the second group.  I'm just remembering that he was wearing red.

**Get me a list of every band that marched in Thoth.**  Then I can try to search youtube with the school/band and Thoth and maybe come across his picture and narrow it down.

2.) Please remove all projectile objects out of your yard.  I don't want it coming through my window.

3.) Turn off all electronics before the power goes out (especially if you are evacuating).  You don't want to come back to your house on fire because a burner started up when the power came back on.  Trust me

4.) Chainsaws / axes.  People's driveways/garages get blocked constantly by fallen trees and large branches. Be prepared to cut and move them out of your way so you can escape.

5.) Candles.  Nighttime sucks when you can't see anything.  Also - interesting fact: As of today

6.) Matches to light candles mentioned above.

7.) Start your generators and let them run a few minutes today. Make sure your oil is good and everything is ready to go.

That should be it. Other than the rest of the obvious stuff - dry goods, batteries, flashlights, etc. 

Mention often forgotten things in the comments please.  

Everyone be safe!


ETA:

- Battery powered radio or TV with antenna to keep current with information after the storm.

- Fill bathtub with water before storm hits.  You may need to use some in the tank for the toilet

- Fill water in tupperware containers and freeze

- Have emergency contacts outside of the area ready.

Meanwhile other cities like Detroit, and Vancouver cause hundreds of injuries and millions of dollars in damage over some trivial like sports.  If that kind of mob mentality can take over after losing a game, how would it not take over after a terrible natural disaster?

He struggled for a while but then landed his dream job and had an awesome girlfriend. Within 4 days he was laid off from his job and his girlfriend dumped him. 

Then about 2 weeks after that he was robbed at gunpoint outside of his house they stole his cell phone and his wallet then used his debit card for over 1000 dollars before he could get his hands on a phone to cancel it. I have recently moved out of town and he is going to come and live with me because he is my beat friends and he just wants to start over in a new place. 

Since his debit card was stolen and used his bank put a 90 day hold on his bank account and he cannot access any of his money. He learned this when he tried to buy a plane ticket to come out to where I am. So since he has to fly out here he is trying to sell all of his stuff. Here is what he has.

Contra to what most people thought, and fell 6 votes short.  According to [this link] (http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/06/marijuana_pot_possession_senat.html#incart_river), it will get another chance today.

The concert was great and we bonded as Clapton played ""Hello old friend"" for the first time since my Dad saw him live in 1978 and we shared a moment as he played ""My Father's Eyes."" But the most powerful memory came a night before at the Arby's on Canal. 

I live in the CBD so we went out on Friday night to Frenchman...drank some Bourbon and diets and made our way home via Bourbon. We stopped at Lafitte's and sang ""Rocketman"" in the back while sharing a Voodoo Purple drink and some cherries and started the walk back to the CBD. As we reached Canal, of all places, the storied Arby's on Canal. He immediately darted up the stairs and tripped on his way (the old man had become a lightweight as the years passed) and a group of young men laughed at his struggles. Unbeknownst to him, the mirrors at the top of the walls on the ground floor allowed me, and everyone else in the establishment, to watch his struggle as he searched in vain for an unlocked restroom. He bounced from door to door with that telltale hop in his step until he settled in front of a garbage can. He paused, and relived himself into the trash receptacle as the same group of young men giggled. I stood in line pretending to be a paying customer until he came back downstairs.

I love this city.  I love the sense of community.  That's why I moved here permanently.

Having said that...





TWICE in 2 days a stranger has initiated conversation with me and as soon as I mention ""I moved here a few days ago"" the person turns their back and says



Very abrupt.   Even a bit ... rude?



Yes these were both women.   Now I know people will explain where this ""stranger danger"" is coming from.    But more importantly





I'm no tourist.   I have a community of friends here and I'm serious about staying here.    Becoming a local.    Trying my hardest to build up a stronger comedy scene in town and to that extent I'm producing a comedy festival in November for that purpose.   So should I focus on that when they ask me if I'm from here?   

I feel like I have a 50/50 chance I will ""offend"" someone by being born somewhere else.   These instances were a little bit hurtful









UPDATE:  Sorry I haven't been able to respond to all these thought provoking comments.  I really didn't expect this big of a dialog.    Hit me kind of hard in the chest.
