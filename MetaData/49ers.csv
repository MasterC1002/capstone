1347415654.0,zqt1h,For those of you worried about extending Bowman,derekre3,161,16,32,"Some of you may know this

Patrick Willis' deal was set to average $10 mil a year in salary until 2016. Thinking that they would have the cap space this season

This allows his contract to be more reasonable down the road. His cap figure next season? $3.5 million. It does go up from there

2012: $17.5 mil

2013: $3.5 mil

2014: $6.4 mil 

2015: $8.7 mil

2016: $9 mil 

There may be room for Bowman after all. They could choose to tear up the last year of Bowman's deal (he's scheduled to make $805k) and sign him to a new deal that is front-loaded in the 2013 season. 

Another less popular method would be to cut Frank Gore after this season :(. I'm not saying this is Gore's last productive season

1359950261.0,17ui3a,5-1 isn't as bad as you think,smacksaw,166,47,91,"When my Steelers lost SB XXX

17 years on

For us

We stupidly called the same play again with our final chance.

He ran the wrong pattern **again**. 

The thing that stings is that we had the game in-hand. The momentum was ours. But we made critical coaching mistakes. You don't throw a timing route to a guy who doesn't practice with the QB. How can there be timing or chemistry?

That was a hard loss to swallow because it was there.

Tonight you have Crabtree and Jimmy Smith. The #1 WR vs the 5th DB for the Ravens. One you should win. But there was no holding call. 

Here's the rub: those refs weren't calling anything. You have to adjust what you do. 

9 years later

This makes Jim a better coach. Would you trade 1 loss for a couple wins? This team is good. He won't make this mistake again. The 49ers are young and have a bright future ahead of them. This is all part of the learning experience. 

It's going to suck ass to think about the non-call

I'm confident this loss is going to lead to more wins in the future. It's going to make guys hungry and appreciate it. It's one people are going to question and no one will make that mistake again. 

After we lost, you're going to be knocking on the door every year.",,False,,t5_2rebv,False,nfc,

1. You can say Kaep fucked up massively with that bad pitch

2. The play calling was terrible all day in general. We ran maybe one screen when they were killing our line

3. We dominate their offense all day

Did certain people play like shit today (OLine

But once again Harbuagh and the coaching staff failed to make adjustments to the same problems we have had all year. Would we have won if we played Smith? Perhaps. 

But why the fuck are people jumping off the CK bandwagon and back onto Smiths dick when the line and the coaches failed him? I didn't want Smith to get benched for CK but don't sit there and pretend this game was solely on Kaep when it wasn't at all. He got very little help today

**EDIT 1:** A point to add. One major reason why I want people to think about these points is that the poor O Line play and bad play calling have been present in every game this year in which our offense has struggled. The guy playing QB has not been the same in all of those games. If we can't block and the play calling is extremely shady in important situations we will struggle offensively no matter who is under center.",,t5_2rebv,1354503306.0,,ovalsf,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/49ers/comments/1462q8/shut_up_about_kaep_vs_smith_and_place_some_blame/

The Seahawks are *supposed* to be our rivals. We're *supposed* to hate them.

They're in our division

To be honest

There's a reason for all of this. If you're an old-timey 49ers fan, the *AFC West*? The Seahawks joined the NFC in 2002. By the time they settled in, the 49ers dynasty had expired. When Hasselbeck told the official that he wanted the ball, and that ""we're gonna score"", it was all about the Greatest Show on Turf. It wasn't about the 49ers dynasty.

1347512281.0,zt3qy,Harbaugh and the media,turlockmike,102,15,22,"There's a lot of controversy (specifically from media personalities like Mike Silver) about how Harbaugh treats the media. The media is constantly trying to get an interesting line and create controversy in order to write a story

Here are my personal thoughts. Harbaugh is a real coach. He meticulously controls every aspect of the game. He places trust in his coaches and players to do their job and then crafts a strategy which utilizes their strengths and minimizes their weaknesses. His weekly focus is on football. He sleeps

As far as the media questions

The other factor I believe that is going is that he is very uncomfortable answering questions about how he feels. This is because he always says things like ""Our goal each week is to win"" and that's what he's comfortable doing. He doesn't think about his feelings because they would get in the way of his goals. So when someone asks him how he feels about something the question is foreign. He does an analysis of the situation and makes logical decisions. He doesn't go with gut

I believe the only way to get through to Harbaugh is to ask him open ended football questions. You will notice that occasionally he will answer a question and come up with some great quotes

Some questions I would have asked on sunday if I were a reporter.

1. What do you believe were the key plays in the game?

2. What kind of approach offensively did you use and why was it succesful?

3. What kind of challenges did the Packers present in the game?

4. Who were the key playmakers in the game?

5. Was there any special preperation for the game today?


A few more ""personal feeling"" questions that would probably still get responses (by asking them in a specific manner)


6. How has your confidence in the team grown after today?

7. What lessons do you think you learned from today's game?

8. How was the team morale during the week as you were preparing?

9. Fans like to know a little bit about the coach they admire

10. We saw your excitement when Aker's made that kick. Can you briefly describe that decision and what you felt when he made it?

2. In the 300s (the bleeders) I was surrounded by Niners Nation. Including a pair of Niners season ticket holders that were visiting NYC and wanted to see the game while they were here. There were people from Berkeley that showed up too. In the four rows around us

3. Starting in the 4th quarter, stayed until the end of the game, many of which going down to better seats that the Jets fans abandoned. The stadium was filled with red instead of green.

The worst three moments of the football fan part of my life are:
3. That bullshit ""pass interference"" call Fred Swearingen perpetrated against Benny Barnes in the 4th quarter of Super Bowl XIII. Or
2. Watching Randy White try to figure out how to secure the football with a cast on one hand, and putting the game barely out of reach. 

But
1. The Catch. 
... was the most devastating moment of my NFL fan-life.

SS are basically undersized, despite some intriguing prospects such as Cyprien and Elam.  However

When you boil it down, **before we drafted him.**  However, I wasn't sure if we'd take a DE in the first or if Reid would even be there at 31.  

Reid is over 6'1"".  

He has elite jumping ability (40.5 vert and 134 broad)

For a S, etc.)  Remember, football is a game of inches.  The difference between a 3 foot window for QB being there and not, is the difference between a 1.55 first 10 and a 1.47 first 10.  Reid has elite first 10 speed.  The majority of the RB's this year were around 1.57.  This may sound like splicing hairs, but if you really think about it, the difference between a 4.3 and 4.4 40 is huge.  Scouts rave about a 4.3.  Now, take that same .1 seconds and create separation in the first 10 yards

His 3 cone and 20 yard shuttle were not elite (compared to the rest of the field)

He has Sasquatch length arms for a DB (33.5 inches)

He played for 3 years at an SEC powerhouse and was a member of an elite secondary that faced the best of the best in the NCAA.

As posted already

Now, LSU had a very aggressive defensive scheme that featured a lot of blitzing from the secondary.  Fangio's blitzes are more calculated and safer, in the sense that he makes sure there is help over the top, so the QB can't just throw it as far as he can and have the WR go get it.

Is Reid perfect in all facets of his game?  No.  But, Culliver was chosen because Baalke said a 6'0""+ CB that is over 200 lbs, and runs in the 4.4's is very hard to find.  He basically implied that unless a CB has these measurables, they will never truly be better than an elite #2 CB.  When we took Culliver, we had a stable of #2's, much like most teams.  However, if we really wanted to try to get a true #1, if we want a true #1 or elite FS
