(I may be one of the more extreme of these, I've become curious as to whether anyone else feels limited with living in only one body.**

A short paragraph of background: I've always had an interest in multiplying my potential output externally, education, and monk-like mind-over-matter. However, these effort-enhancers feel like they're **just a workaround**. What I really want is the potential to inhabit multiple, artificial bodies at once (the artificial qualifier being important in order to emphasise the point that I'm not taking anyone else's rights from them, merely expanding my own presence), as well as an increased ability and speed of cognition.

What I'm suggesting is that the brain, it can be improved - and expanded. Although my current brain is hardwired to work with only one body, it could become a reality that I can move several arms and focus on several tasks - multithread myself - just as easily as I currently understand moving one.

I'm looking for bold artists whose work explores the changing relationship between man and machine. This doesn't necessarily mean every submission is transhumanist but I believe that our every day lives are being radically redefined by technology and art that examines that is becoming more and more powerful.

I hope this is something you guys might be interested in reading or submitting too or just sharing with people who might be. As it stands now our first release will at least be a free PDF

Only the technological. I know not if this is and underestimate of the genetic code that rises from the many thousands of compromises in our DNA which is understandable. We are blind. We are deaf. We have no sense of smell taste or touch. We are weak. Or if this is brought about from the ever present short sightedness of the all too human self preservation instinct. Either one is understandable however unacceptable. Technology should be at best a secondary objective to fix problems in the intended biology. Inorganic machines unlike organic machine can be fixed easily. They do however fall short in the durability of the organic machine. The organic machine also has a much more powerful processer that does need to be aided in efficiency by its more primitive inorganic counterparts. Even with the limited knowledge of today we could create humans that have the following advancement within 10 maybe 20 years for the advancements we don't have the codes for yet. This of course only possible if someone actually gets the funding to attempt it.

* bones nearly unbreakable and far stronger than steel of the same thickness(already naturally found in a single family of humans. Occurred last generation. Mutation dominant.)

* skeletal muscles with twice as many cells as a normal human's and more endurance than those of a bodybuilder's.(already naturally found in humans. Occurred this generation. Only one know subject. Mutation dominant.)

* inability to get any cholesterol or food related heart disease. Plac build up impossible.( already naturally found in humans. Occurred a few generations back. Currently more than 70 subjects.)

* antifreeze in the blood. High risistance to cold temperatures.(genetic code known.)

* an internal defibulator made of a store of fat cells above the heart instinctively shocking the heart back to life in the event of it stopping

* symbiotic algae that cluster around the mitocondria and are passed on through gametes. This occurs in a single species of lizards and would take awhile to decode but the possibility is still there. 
 
* the ability to see in twelve primary colors. Occurs in a single species of shrimp the genetic code is unknown.

(This is the end of the summary there is far more that can be done at this point of time but this should get the message across.)
 
These are examples of the possibilities of today's limited understanding. After an higher understanding of DNA is astablished far greater feats of biological advancement can be obtained.

A few days ago I had my run in with mortality... (This is the long dramatic version

I was playing a light-hearted game of frisbee with two of my friends at a park, followed by a brief moment of silence. 

I looked back at my friends for re-assurance. I wanted to see if I was still here, laid on my back, expecting nothing short of a return voyage back to my previous state of health and security. I was not taken back. I was rushed to the ER and taken in to get a cardioversion to stop and reset my heart. It worked. My heart rate went down from 220~ to 2 and then, a few seconds later, back up to 98~.

The doc told me I have SVT. He said that during the attack

TLDR: heart problems

Prior to this incident I was certain of my path. Physics. I was sure I would get my PhD and that I would spend the rest of my days very happily working in a lab and very happily spending my free time. Not anymore. During my cardioversion I had a weird experience. My body said I was dead

I am a freshmen who just registered for my first classes at a four year university. I have been dwelling on the idea of living a similar life that I had planned before, idk. Now that brings me to....

Human was a very loose term in its mind. Calling it a Human was more akin to calling it a worm or an insect

Consciousness has spent eons learning everything and solving every puzzle

It thought without words and more with a kind of lucid dream, it explored realms of pure time and pure space, it travelled in drifts of energy and through black holes in boredom. Because that's what it was bored. 

It remained unthinking for infinity

Consciousness decided that it could compress space time to a single point. If it created gravity so powerful that the universe shrank to an infinitesimal size. This would then explode in fresh creation.

It knew then that it had been in a cycle of death and rebirth this way for an unlimited amount of time. The same universe the exact same outcomes each time. Or was this the very first cycle? or even that every cycle was this cycle since it was a product of that universe, equaling zero. 

Consciousness thought that the inevitable and logical action was to commence a restart on itself

It pondered for a moment that no God (other than itself) existed and no other universes did either just the simple dimensions that powered this one. Space and time was just straight lines on a grid

Its thoughts died as it began to compress space back to a low entropy state of endless potential and light.

[In the comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/wr4ue/brain_preservation_foundation/) here at transhumanism

I very much recommend [reading it](http://chronicle.com/article/The-Strange-Neuroscience-of/132819/).

But now for my problem: The article also contains one very strong analogy as to why hosting a consciousness within a connectome will never happen:

*The Baylor neuroscientist David Eagleman offers an analogy. Suppose that an alien creates a perfect street map of Manhattan. Would that explain how Manhattan functions and what makes it unique? To answer those questions, how people are interacting. Dropping the analogy, Eagleman says, ""Maybe we need to know the states of the individual proteins, their exact spatial distributions, how they articulate with neighboring proteins, and so on."" To understand the brain well enough to copy it

*""Neuroscience is obsessed with neurons because our best technology allows us to measure them, trafficking and interacting in extraordinarily complex biochemical cascades.""*

To me this analogy really takes the wind out of the sails of connectome research for the purpose of hosting a human consciousness: A perfect map of the neurons in your brain

Is there any insight as to why this analogy may be flawed in some way? 

**EDIT: (3 days later) ...................**

Reading your posts and thinking more on this, how would you tell a connectome that it just took an Advil? 

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/wvtzh/in_a_first_an_entire_organism_is_simulated_by/) just got posted here at transhumanism and I'm laughing because it pretty much addresses that question. A program for every cell (and a program to oversee all cells). Could this system give a realistic enough input for a connectome to fire accordingly? Maybe. It sure is fun to think about.

One of the fundamental assumptions of economic theory is 'perfect information'. Many inefficiencies in economic and social systems can be explained by imperfect information

Whole sectors of our modern economy are built around gathering reliable information. Science is dedicated to gathering and deciphering accurate information. The justice system's goal is to gather correct information so it can make valid judgement. 

Humans' ability to store and examine information continually expands as data storage becomes cheaper and technology becomes better. Tools to gather information will become better and more ubiquitous as well. It seems to me that as information becomes cheaper and as our ability to sift through information becomes better

For example, there would never be a question of what actions a person took. If we gain technology to decipher thoughts, and if the technology becomes cheap enough, it is possible that there would not be a question of what anybody ever thought. And if technology develops such that the swathe of information is easily searchable and accessible, then all you would need is a question to find the answer.

I think dystopian future predictions involving no privacy and surveillance would only be true in cases of information asymmetry. As long as all surveillance information was public information

TL;DR: Will transhumans have access to infinite amounts of information and will they have the ability to evaluate it in useful ways?

What are your thoughts on a world with no privacy? If the lack of privacy extends to all individuals and circumstances

Because owners of the fruit of productivity gains are business owners (like me).  If/when a business owner puts a tool in the hands of an employee that doubles the employee's productivity

Society as a whole gains as products become cheaper and cheaper and/or quality improves.

Yes, nothing to do.  The ones who do work are engineers and managers, and they don't have much to do either, usually just push a few buttons.

Many years ago in Reader's Digest there was an article about ""time saving"" devices and why we're not saving time.  A good example was that early in the 1900's almost every middle class household had a maid who every week would come, the maid fired, and the lady-of-the-house now vacuumed the rugs, ADDING to her time spent on household chores rather than saving time.  Same went for household market delivery of foods - ""supermarkets"" meant now the lady-of-the-house spent time shopping.

Goal: Monastic Humanist/Trans-Humanist Order

Why?: To create a group of people and their supporters who will usher Mankind into a new age and the new stage of Evolution.

Purposes: They will be part Scientist, men and women whom transcended humanity yet embraced the most positive aspects of human nature. They will be the Guardians of Man. If nations fall these armored individuals will spread learning and light to them, if nations bicker they will try to reason, if we as a people have need they will seek out those answers and ultimately they will be custodian to the greatest collection of works penned by the hands of Mankind.

They will be the culmination of all current human knowledge and effort, drilled in ethics, with an access to the depths of knowledge and the ability to simplify it for consumption amongst the populace. For the truth is men are inspired by deed as much as word, they must be heroes of a new age. If we falter and fall, they will be there to pick up the pieces as the firebrands of reason and order.

For the last century or so our species has established a dynamic where high-technology is out of reach of all but the wealthiest institutions.

These institutions (federal governments), synthetic biology, advanced physics, etc... have all been, it seems, cost prohibitive to nearly all organizations, particularly those that have as their driving component the need to acquire capital.

What outcomes arise from such a dynamic? What I am posing here is that technological progress has been restricted by setting such a high price

We can appreciate that much of technological R&amp;D is prohibitively expensive. We can safely say that misuse or abuse of technology poses a substantial risk, is it so illogical to assume that in order to help ensure species survival, we instituted an access-reducing mechanism, so nearly all human beings (95%), are unable to pursue volatile technologies simply because *it is too costly to do so?*

Are we crazy to assume this is intentional? Consider the tech-transfer industry. We accept as canon that the Federal governments of the world must shoulder the cost of advanced R&amp;D

Considering this

Haven't we all wondered what we are actually capable of? Maybe new energy systems, etc... have, in fact, made enough progress to achieved our 'leap' into the next stage of humanity, but the risks are so profound, an system of economics has been implemented to prevent flying to close to the sun too quickly. 

Thoughts?

The races competing in this far-future world represent various lines that will be points of contention as transhumanism becomes the driving force behind our evolution.

CLASSIFICATION 0
Humans who reject not just bodily alteration
Primitives hold no power on a larger than local scale.  They are as irrelevant now as chimps were at the dawn of the 21st Century.  They have been granted ecologically-viable land on multiple worlds, is nonexistent.

CLASSIFICATION 1
Humans who are very close to who we are today.  They will take drugs as long as they don’t involve intelligent nanomachines or genetic therapy.  They will even make use of external cybernetics like night vision glasses and communication headsets.  Most are also willing to use low-tech cybernetics like cochlear implants to cure deafness and replacement limbs for the disabled.
Purists eke out a small amount of relevance by making use of remotely- and directly-piloted vehicles with non-invasive brain-to-computer interfaces.  They are
Some purists

CLASSIFICATION 2
Humans, they are fully open to gene therapy, eugenics, and outright genetic enhancement.  They can be subdivided into Classification 2a, representing humans who accept only genetic modifications that would not cause them to exceed the bounds or anatomical forms of “natural” humans, and Classification 2b, representing those who will accept any degree of genetic modification (including things like extra limbs, etc.)  A “c” is used to note those of Classification 2 who accept brain-altering modifications.  This creates two additional subclasses: 2ac and 2bc.
Like Classification 1 humans, due to their willingness to transcend human physical and/or mental boundaries.  However, their willingness to do so only through the relatively inefficient medium of genetic modification limits them to only holding power on a larger scale very rarely.
Genoids that cooperate with non-self-aware AI are classified with an “i

CLASSIFICATION 3
Transhumans in this category are willing to accept a vast variety of cybernetics, submersibles, and land vehicles.  Many change their physical form regularly.  Some, referred to as “Classification 3-multi,” are comfortable with operating multiple copies of their neural structure in multiple physical housings that might be light years apart.
What sets them apart from higher-classification posthumans is their unwillingness to give up the brain.  They require any modifications to their physical form to preserve the neural structure and operation of the biological brain they were born with.  Additional software that supplements this structure is accepted by most
Classification 3 are the lowest classification of beings that hold some form of power on a galactic scale.  Especially in the case of 3-multis
In the case of “Hard 3s, generally expand their numbers simply by creating more copies of existing Neuro-seeds.
Class 3s that cooperate with non-self-aware AIs are not given their own classification

Calssification 4: “Independent AIs”
Posthumans who have given up every vestige of what biological humanity represented.  They take whatever forms they wish, and network with others like them to pool information and resources.
Where they have drawn the line is at individuality.  Each Classification 4 being has an identity at the core of their software
Classification 4s were the dominant force in the galaxy for a great while, and in some areas battle guerrilla bands of Classification 3s looking to carve resources off the edges of their territory.  They regard their primary opponent with a sort of Cold War, nonviolent watchfulness.  It seems to be doing the same, for now.

Classification 5: “PHMO”
Referred to as “Pheemo” by those beings who still use their mouths to articulate language (and are even aware of its existence), as well as all recorded knowledge, of every human and computer that contributed to its mainframes at some point in the past.  It can access, analyze, and synthesize all of this data with perfect recall and at the speed of light, collating it with the new data it is collecting constantly from all of its networked sensor units.
There is no doubt that PHMO has become the dominant force in the Milky Way galaxy, it seems to have deemed to tolerate lesser intelligent existences operating in its shadow.  How long that state of affairs will last, not even the greatest minds of the Class 4s can precisely predict.",,False,self,t5_2qlii,,http://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/kigol/writing_a_scifi_story_based_on_transhumanism/

I was thinking about starting a company to provide genetic enhancements to willing humans. Specifically I was thinking about using a zinc-finger nuclease to knock-out the human myostatin gene and induce muscular hypertrophy for starters. Also knocking out the P21 to improve regenerative capacity. I've done some research and it seems quite feasible. Sigma-Aldrich already sells the plasmid and mRNA for the zfn to knock out the human myostatin gene. I was mainly concerned about things like finding funds and the possiblity of gov't thugs kicking down my door. Can anyone give me advice?

(xpost from r/singularity),no_witty_username,2,0,0,"I would like to hear what you guys think will be some of the issues that a post singularity society will be dealing with. Also it would be great to hear of what you think the resolutions to those issues might be.
Ill start off with some ideas I have floating in my head.
Does a virtual human posses the same rights as a biological human?
What constitutes a virtual human?
Do your virtual human clones posses the same rights as the original?
How are the resources relocated once you clone your self?
What is the currency of a post singularity society?
How is this currency distributed?
How is the currency obtained?
Who distributes the currency?
How to shield against EMP?
What are the rules and regulations concerning virtual backups?
This issue will be a very complex matter to resolve. At first you might think, manslaughter, negligence will be applied differently depending on whether he is virtual or not. Also consider that a virtual human might decide to murder innocent sentient NPC's who were random spawns of Grand Theft Auto 12, should he be accountable for those murders? In the end I expect that at the beginning of the singularity virtual humans will posses less rights then their biological counterparts, shortly after they will gain the same rights and eventually they will posses greater rights then their biological counterparts. At the apex of the singularity biological beings will be viewed as nothing more then bygone remnants of chemical evolution. They will posses little if any power over the course of foreseen future.
Defining what a virtual human is will become harder as time passes and entities evolve in the virtual realm. Virtual entities will become so different from what we now consider human that I think eventually no one will care what your label is. But in the beginning it will be an ongoing struggle to define what is human in order to figure out what possesses rights and privileges.
I think virtual clones will possess same rights as the original but those rights will start to diverge depending if the clone stagnates or excels in his intelligence. More intelligent = more rights
I think it would be fair to distribute resources proportionally to the intelligence of the clones. That is to say if you cloned your self and modified his intelligence to be greater then your's
The currency is processing power and storage. Every intelligent entity will strive to horde as much processing power and storage as possible. This will make raw materials such as land very valuable
This I have no Idea. I mean its a double edged sword. If you don't possess the necessary processing power to begin with, but I just don't see it. Equal distribution of resources doesn't make sense because more intelligent entities will always demand more resources.
Obtaining more land will yield more processing power. So I think once every ounce of earth is used up and converted
Manifest destiny. Basically land squatting will be the norm. I found this piece of asteroid
Advanced EMP devises will be the equivalent of Nuclear bombs of today. They will strike fear in to every virtual entity. I think some advanced forms of shielding will be created but have no idea what.
