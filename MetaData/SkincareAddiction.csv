Like many of you, he's been getting his grubby mitts inside and making me nervous about how hygienic the moisturizer was. So rather than go through the trouble of de-potting it, I looked for a lid with a built-in pump so both of us could use it without worry about dirt/lint/cat fur getting inside because *someone* (who shall remain nameless) doesn't always wash his hands before using it.

Anyway

- [Photo of how it looks on my tub with the old lid right next to it](http://i.imgur.com/TJKdZZ8.jpg). It fit as is

- *ninja edit*: [Artistic interpretation](http://i.imgur.com/yDbNTH3.jpg) courtesy of /u/padlocked

- [Gratuitous kitty cat photo](http://i.imgur.com/f9keo4M.jpg)!!!

However, but it works like magic once the moisturizer starts coming out. I use maybe 1/4 of a pump for my face, it delivers a lot of product!

I sanitized it with rubbing alcohol prior to putting it in the tub

Hope this helps you guys out!

------------------------------------------

**EDIT:** Wow

Anyway

- /u/sports__fan shared [this tip](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1k3k7p/attention_all_cerave_in_the_tub_users_ive_found/cblmt1a) in the comments:

&gt;If you live near a Walgreens you can probably find a product called [Heel Rescue](http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/profoot-care-heel-rescue-superior-moisturizing-foot-cream/ID=prod1181994-product). The pump that comes with it fits the CeraVe tub perfectly. You'll have to trim the straw to make it fit but it works well.
&gt;
&gt;http://imgur.com/a/tLmH3
&gt;
&gt;The Heel Rescue costs about $9 with tax. Which is about what you'd pay to buy and ship a pump online.

Other pumps available for purchase online:

- ***USA:*** [Here's yet another lid on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Pump-China-Gel-Therapeutic-Topical-Reliever/dp/B001ANN6G6/) that I'm almost positive will fit (it's marketed to fit the same kind of product as the other one)

- ***USA:*** You can also buy a lid [here](http://www.essentialsupplies.com/~smartcart/cgi/display.cgi?item_num=DC89-PUMP28&amp;dept=Caps) and the pump to fit it [here](http://www.essentialsupplies.com/~smartcart/cgi/display.cgi?item_num=N3271-BLACK&amp;dept=) (you will have to cut the stem to fit in the tub) - sorry

- ***USA &amp; CANADA:*** [Here's the whole shebang](http://www.containerandpackaging.com/item/DP16) - it's ribbed so not as pretty but it's functional! You will also need to trim the stem on this one too.

- ***CANADA:*** [Here is a lid source](http://www.saffireblue.ca/shop/closures/89-400-closures/white-lidpump-and-7-dip-tube-89-400) that /u/functi0nal shared in the comments.

If anyone else finds others

**EDIT EDIT:** 

Also

&gt; No, it does mention in the abstract that a pump is cleaner than scooping. 

&gt; In the study volunteers used shampoo and lotion without preservatives for 2-3 weeks. The two different products, flip-cap, screw-cap, pump-top.  

&gt; &gt; The standard screw-cap closure provided only minimal protection against microbial contamination of both the shampoo (29% contamination incidence) and the skin lotion (71%). The slit-cap closure on the shampoo container and the flip-cap closure on the skin lotion container provided slightly enhanced degrees of protection (21 and 39% contamination incidence, closure type plays an important role in protecting poorly preserved products from in-use microbial contamination.",,False,self,t5_2tbbg,1376252595.0,,

We mods decided to post a quick ""rules of the subreddit"" guide so that you all settle in fast and keep the front page full of high-quality content. : )

Some important things for you to do: **READ THE SIDEBAR**
_________________________________________________________

**Rules**

1) This is a subreddit dedicated to *science-based skincare*.  What that means is that we look for peer-reviewed journal articles about skincare products, anecdotal evidence is fine, but you must be clear that the plural of ""anecdote"" is not ""data.""  Anecdotes can provide eyebrow quirks and inspiration, but they are not science.  In addition, many of our moderators have extensive background in scientific and medical research, so this is pretty standard for us.

2) **[We do not give medical advice or diagnoses](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/19ni63/psa_when_posting_please_try_to_stray_away_from/)**.  While it may get repetitive for us to say ""go see your dermatologist!"", and besides, it's against Reddit's TOS.  Posts and comments asking for/giving medical advice/diagnoses *will be removed*.  Please report them if you see them!

3) **No self-promotion.** We do not tolerate product shilling or shilling of your blog, we reserve the right to ban you.  If you find a blog post by someone else you like, great, submit it!

4) **No asshattery.** Excessive rudeness and phobias against people will be result in banning.

**Pro-tips and discussion**

- *Naturalistic fallacy and Safety First (from /u/chromiselda)*: We want to make sure that people take the right advice from us and aren't persuaded towards a harmful one. Manufacturers of skincare products have to do lots of testing on what they sell to make sure that it is safe for humans to use. When someone puts forth a non-traditional remedy

  This brings me to my next point: Natural does not mean ""healthy"" or ""safe"". The term ""natural"" is really unregulated

  We want to promote people proposing good solutions to the rest of this sub

  (a) Safe

  (b) Do what they say they'll do (for the average person that they are intended for).

  [This](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3266803/?report=reader) is a great article to read in general with a solid TLDR at the end. One paragraph particularly relates to this discussion:

  &gt; So what about products that are branded as natural or organic — are they more effective or safer to apply to the skin? “I think you’d be deceiving yourself a little bit there by thinking that just because it is natural, and you don’t rub that on your skin.”

- *[Dietary advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1gcpn2/reader_poll_share_your_thoughts_on_a_moderation/)*: Many people find that particular diets affect their skin and general health. There is a good way to recommend dietary advice and a potentially harmful way. 

  For example, you'll find that detoxing is actually a bit of a contradiction. There are toxins in everything you eat: fruit, vegetables, meats, everything. Simply cutting out meat and eating bananas doesn't mean your body will be ""toxin free"". In fact, in most cases these diets cause people to be more prone to fatigue and unable to concentrate well. It can result in an unhealthy lifestyle (even though that's the opposite of what you intended!) and also be dangerous. /u/Khokhmah said once, ""If your body was unable to rid itself 'toxins', before going on something like this. Starting a diet because you read about it on the internet is unwise.
  

  Another example is an elimination diet. This means you completely cut out a food, for a period of some odd months, in order to see if it has an effect on your body. This is a very murky area since we don't know someone's health background or what their culture is (if a particular group of foods or single food is a staple) or if they have a solid knowledge base about how to change the diet appropriately.  Elimination diet advice is not be recommended unless done so after prefacing the advice to consult a physician or specialist (like an RD or nutritionist). If someone suspects a food allergy or sensitivity, try to see an allergist to actually get tested: you may wind up with an underlying medical condition. [This](http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/foodallergy/understanding/pages/diagnosis.aspx) is the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease' link on elimination diets.

- **Cleanser** 

  We frequently tell folks it's not necessary to cleanse 2x a day

  If your skin is feeling tight/dry/squeaky after cleansing

  *Cleanser Recs*
  
  ~ Cerave Foaming (US/Canada): Suitable for acne prone

  ~ Cerave Hydrating (US/Canada): Better for non-acne prone/dry

  ~ Spectro Jel (US/Canada): Suitable for acne-prones

  ~ Boots Sensitive Foaming Wash (UK/US/Canada/other?): Potentially suitable for all skin types

  ~ Eucerin DermatoClean

  ~ [Oil Cleansing](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/): Suitable for almost all skin types

  
- **Exfoliation**

  Chemical exfoliation is the preferred method on /r/skincareaddiction

Lactic acid is the most gentle, start with a BHA.

  Physical exfoliation (yes this includes a washcloth and the Clarisonic!) should not be used more than 1-2x a week, flaking, or irritated skin.

  Exfoliation will be beneficial if you have any of the following concerns (not comprehensive): zits, blackheads, whiteheads, dull skin, dry skin, [sebaceous filaments (SFs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fmg0t/some_more_information_about_sebaceous_filaments/), etc

  *BHA exfoliator recs (alcohol free)*

  ~ Stridex Maximum Strength Pads aka Stridex in the red box (US/available on iherb or Vitacost): If known serious sensitivity to light fragrance/menthol proceed with caution. These tend to work fine for the majority of people

  ~ Paula's Choice BHAs (Worldwide): Fragrance-free options

  ~ BravuraLondon (UK): Various BHA products

  *AHA exfoliator recs*

  ~ St Ives Scrub Free Exfoliating Pads (US/Canada): 4-5% lactic acid. If very sensitive to fragrance or known fruit allergies

  ~ Silk Naturals AHA Toner (US based but will ship to some international locations): 8% Lactic acid. Contains aloe. Fragrance-free.

  ~ Paula's Choice AHAs (Worldwide): Varying concentrations of glycolic acid

  ~ Olay Regenerist Night Resurfacing Elixir (Worldwide): 8-10% glycolic acid

  ~ BravuraLondon (UK): Varying Glycolic/lactic/ AHA+BHA combos

  ~ Alpha Hydrox Oil Free Gel (US/ Parent company may ship international to some locations): 10% glycolic acid

  ~ Alpha Hydrox Swipes or Intensive Serum ( US/ Parent company may ship international to some locations): 14% glycolic acid

- **Moisturize**

  Everyone needs a moisturizer

  *Moisturizer Recs*

  ~ Cerave Cream aka Cerave in the tub (US/Canada): Suitable for any skin type. Also works for the body. Fast absorbing
  
  ~ Oilatum Natural Repair (UK): Suitable for any skin type. Similar to Cerave in the tub

  ~ Cetaphil Lotion/Cream (Many locations worldwide): Suitable for any skin type. Slightly greasier formula to Cerave in the tub. 

  ~ Vaseline  (Worldwide): Suitable for any skin type. Good to add on top of moisturizer

  ~ EltaMD Intense Moisturizer (US): Vaseline alternative


- **Sunscreen**

  This is your choice, benzoyl peroxide, or you're on particular oral medications.

  Proper amount for application is 2mg/cm^2. This is about 1/4 teaspoon (~1.2 mL) for the face alone. Reapplication should be every 1.5-2 hours (maybe even more depending on how nasty the UV index will be that day)

  Recommendations highly vary depending on location and type of finish you prefer. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/15tuqd/for_those_interested_in_trying_out_new_susncreens/) sidebar link on sunscreens gives you all you need to know.  Also

  Generally

- **Spot Treatments/Masks**

  This will vary based on your skin type

  *Spot Treatments to Consider*

  ~ Benzoyl Peroxide cream/wash:  If in a wash

  ~ Sulfur ointment/cream: Tends to be less irritating than BP

  ~ Tea Tree Oil: Should be diluted with a carrier oil to avoid a chemical burn. Avoid if prone to allergic contact dermatitis. Potent fragrance.

  ~ Neem Oil: Very potent fragrance 

  ~ Clay masks: These will help clear pores and help bring some acne to a head.    Bentonite is the strongest

Also, avoiding common skin irritants just makes choosing products easier.

About me: I'm a 20 year old male who had acne for 6 or so years and spent a lot of time researching how to beat it. I obtained a lot of knowledge from reddit so I felt like giving back. I'm on a throwaway so feel free to upvote for visibility so we can cure everyone's acne.

Without further adieu..

* Change your pillowcase daily. If you're poor just buy a bunch of cheap white towels from Walmart. If you're lazy just rest your head on clean shirts. Also if you flip it over you can get a couple uses out of it.
* Dyes and perfumes irritate many peoples skins. Choose a detergent without these chemicals when doing the wash.
* Don't use a fabric softener. Can be irritating.
* Avoid dairy. This one actually cured my acne. I didn't eat much cheese but when I stopped my face completely cleared up. If you search [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) you will see a lot of studies showing a link between dairy and acne. Again
* The other dietary link to acne for some people is food high on the glycemic index. The glycemic index measures how quickly blood sugar levels rise after eating some food. Basically
* Try to use lukewarm water. Very hot and very cold water irritates and dries out the skin. Contrary to popular belief
* While I'm on the subject
* Don't overwash your skin. For most people washing their face twice a day works best. With others once a day is actually better. However
* Prefer chemical exfoliation over manual. AHA's like Glycolic Acid and Lactic Acid and BHA's like Salicylic Acid are generally considered superior to physical exfoliation products because they don't irritate the skin (kill acne with kindness). A lot of people prefer BHA's for their anti-inflammatory properties.
* Prefer low concentrations of chemicals. Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) kills Propionibacterium acnes
* Is acne only at one spot on your face? Only your shoulders or forehead
* Drink a lot of water. I'm sure you've heard this before in many different contexts. It's human fuel. 3 days without and you're done. Drink more water. How do you know if you're drinking enough? Your pee should be clear instead of yellow.
* Have a healthy diet. Acne is mostly caused internally and shows itself externally. You're probably deficient in Vitamin D and Omega 3 fatty acids, hats, and take Vitamin D supplementation for optimal health. You can pretty much only get sufficient Omega 3's from a fishy diet and expensive grass-fed meats so I just supplement it instead. I only supplement Vitamin D and Fish Oil because even with an *okay* diet you're probably only deficient in those two things.
* If you move around a lot during sleep and your face is rubbing against a harsh fabric or oils it could irritate your skin. Try sleeping on your back with proper pillow positioning to maintain a neutral spine. Personally I have a bad back so I have to sleep on my side and just try not to move around too much.
* Don't touch your face. Your hands, or at least oily and greasy. The only time you touch your face is while you're washing your face and are cleansing/exfoliating/moisturizing/whatevering.
* Don't pick at your skin or squeeze parts of your skin. The only time you should really do this is after you've washed your hands during your skincare routine and should only attempt it if it's ready to pop and you only need to apply a small amount of pressure in order to release it.
* Don't use any product that clogs your pores. [Here's a list](http://www.beneficialbotanicals.com/facts-figures/comedogenic-rating.html) of comedeogenic ratings for products. Comedeogenic just means tendency to clog pores. This list doesn't mean that something with a 4 will definitely clog your pores though (depends on skin type/genetics/etc). Some people are fine with coconut oil
* Use a moisturizer if your skin is dry. How do you know if your skin is dry? Well
* Cleanse your skin during your skin care routine. During the day and night bacteria accumulates, oils are gathered, and products (make-up, sunscreen, moisturizer, etc.) are applied. It's just like brushing your teeth. Twice a day and feel fresh.
* Exfoliate, for example. Works great for the rest of your body too.
* Avoid the sun. Other than sunlight basically being carcinogenic by UVA and UVB radiation mutating DNA and causing skin cancers and [premature aging](http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim/2012/06/04/trucker-damage-face_web_620x350.jpg) but its ""positive"" effect on acne is mostly an illusion. After getting a tan acne may be less visible but that's just because your skin was damaged and is darker so it's harder to see. The reason why I said mostly is because sometimes sunlight can legitimately help acne by killing acne-causing bacteria with UV rays. Can be a decent short-term solution though.
* Use a moisturizer if you're going to be hit by harsh winds. Also
* I generally like to avoid expensive products. Most of acne is caused by something already mentioned and most fixes are free and those that aren't can be purchased cheaply. Shea butter, sugar, gentle cleansers, and other basic skin care products are cheap. Even if something expensive does work, do you really want to depend on that forever? Don't be swindled in to the artificial markup. All the ingredients used in most formulations are cheap and massively produced. Other than for cleansing, I like to use single ingredients for skin-care.
* If you don't feel like researching ingredients, fragance-free, and paraben-free. Just note that these aren't really regulated and the effectiveness of a product is based on its ingredients and their proportions.
* Almost forgot to mention hormones. Changes and fluctuations with hormones can affect your acne. Women on their period
* Avoid stress. It sound weird but stress can cause acne and other conditions. Acne can be mainly hormonal and stress can effect your androgen and cortisol levels which can lead to sebum production, avoiding negatives emotions, and stay relaxed.
* When in the shower, oils and debris from your hair is washed off and drips down all over your face and the rest of your body. Generally, I like to do a top-down approach when showering to avoid this issue, however minor it may be.
* Avoid large amounts of makeup and the use of many different products. A lot of women cover up their bad skin with makeup and in turn just make their skin worse with all the products clogging their pores. It's a vicious cycle. You'd be surprised how well a good moisturizer and proper skin care can replace blush
* Visit /r/wicked_edge if you believe your acne to be partially caused by improper shaving techniques. Basically
* Use one towel for drying your hair and one towel for drying your body. Keep them separated so you can keep the oils separated as well.
* Pat your skin dry instead of vigorously rubbing it dry. After your shower wipe all the dripping water off of you with your palms so not as much will be absorbed in to your towel so they stay cleaner for longer.
* Exercise daily but try to do it at a time before when you normally shower. For example
* Accutane, lips, mouth, etc. It can also cause liver problems, depression, birth defects if taken during pregnancy, etc. Talk to a professional if nothing else works.
* If you've tried everything and even bit the bullet and tried Accutane for its entire course and still nothing you still have an option. Waiting. A lot of acne is hormonal and will eventually clear up on its own

**PLEASE** DO NOT USE BAKING SODA ON YOUR SKIN. I know most people here at /r/skincareaddiction know this already

If you remember anything from your high school chemistry class, in which case it is neutral). As a reference point, your skin is roughly a pH of 4.5-5, blood is 7, an effective AHA or BHA is 3.5-4, baking soda is a 9, and the average WHITE vinegar (5-10% acetic acid) is 2.40-3.40.

pH is so very important in skincare -- too alkaline and the skin barrier is disrupted or damaged

Vinegar and baking soda are household chemicals and they are not safer just because they are not in a bottle in the skincare aisle. Baking soda can be used to scrub stains out of a toilet while vinegar can be used to break down lime build-up on your tub or sink. These are *chemicals*. They are not safer than your Cetaphil cleanser just because they are only one or two ingredients. 

Skin care problems are generally caused by genetics, such as *scrubbing dehydrated, acne skin with baking soda*, which damages the skincare barrier and makes your face a bacterial breeding ground. Think of your skin barrier as part of your immune system -- it is essential for keeping the bad guys out and the good stuff in, such as moisture. Scrubbing it with a too-alkaline cleanser is increasing moisture loss and decreasing the ability to keep bacteria on your skin in check. Worse, by toning your skin with a product with a pH of 2.4-3.4, you are putting your skin at risk for *chemical burns*

This post is written to address those of us who shave (use of razor) or epilate (waxing, or use of an epilator)

**Chemical depilatories (eg, and laser hair removal are *not* included in this guide, as exfoliation prior to treatment can cause at best more irritation and at worst more serious damage to the skin.**

---------------
So

    1. Cleansing
        
    2. Exfoliation
        
    3. Softening Hair and Skin
        
    4. Minimization of Friction

Let's go through what is involved with each of these steps.

-----

Step One: Cleansing
--------

Having clean skin is crucial to preventing infections. Period. With all forms of hair removal, in the process, the creation of a small wound.

The easiest way to cleanse your skin is to shower. As you will see below

Some methods don't really lend themselves to this (in-salon waxing, an alcohol swab should be used to disinfect the skin prior to hair removal.


Step Two: Exfoliation
-----

Removal of excess dead skin, but also crucial to prevent ingrown hairs after the hair begins to grow back. There are two kinds of exfoliants: chemical and mechanical/physical. Chemical exfoliants are typically acids and can be super useful for keeping your skin healthy if your body has a difficult time keeping the skin cell conveyor belt moving. Chemical exfoliants, however, should *not* be used for hair removal, as these are specifically intended to aid in skin cell turnover over time or for dramatic resurfacing peels - not for the gentle, acute exfoliation required for hair removal. You want to stick to mechanical/physical exfoliants.

For best results

Mechanical/physical exfoliators are things like loofahs, and brushes. Not all of these exfoliators are created equally, though! There are two important considerations for the choice of an appropriate exfoliator:

1. How thick or delicate is the skin on which I am using it?

2. How soft or harsh is the exfoliator I am using?

Areas such as the face are notoriously delicate and therefore require a less harsh exfoliator. Scrubs should **not** have broken/jagged pieces (such as the ground walnut shell in [St. Ives Invigorating Apricot Scrub](http://www.stives.com/Facial-Products/Fresh-Skin/Invigorating-Apricot-Scrub/).) These cause micro-tears in the skin

Here are some general guidelines and examples for what you can use and where to use it:

***Face Area***

- A facial scrub with round micro-beads (eg

- A gentle soft-bristle scrub brush (eg. [Sephora Complexion Brush](http://www.sephora.com/face-complexion-brush-P0096) or [Clarisonic Facial Brush](http://www.clarisonic.com/))

***Armpit/Groin Area***

- A sugar scrub (eg

***Arm/Leg Area***

- A sugar scrub (eg

- A nylon bath towel (eg

- A stiff bristle scrub brush (eg

- A natural loofah sponge (eg

You will note that I listed sugar scrubs but not salt scrubs. Salt scrubs are much harsher and more irritating than sugar scrubs without providing any additional benefits. Therefore

I have also omitted those [nylon bath pouf loofah thingies](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OHL1ZxgUhkY/TEX022s9v6I/AAAAAAAALic/pLoqqplM5TA/s1600/bath-pouf-274x300.jpg) you see everywhere because the nylon bath towels I listed do a MUCH better job of exfoliating, dry faster, and provide just as much sudsing power. Plus it's much easier to scrub your back with one!

Also, and the inherent sensitivity of these areas. Therefore, I advocate using a sugar scrub exclusively on these areas. I find it to be a good compromise between effectiveness at removing deoderant/antipersperant and excess skin flakes around thick hair, as well as with gentleness. I have used the Giovanni sugar scrub I linked above on my armpits and bikini line for years with *amazing* results. 

Step Three: Softening Hair and Skin
-------

This step is easy - the most effective and efficient way of doing this is with heat and moisture. Take a shower! Showering softens hair and skin and allows for more effective hair removal.

When shaving

Step Four: Minimization of Friction
-----

When dragging or applying an implement across your skin to remove hair, it really depends on which method you are using. Threading and tweezing don't involve much contact with skin and therefore this is not much of a concern.

For waxing, a thin coating of cornstarch or baby powder on the skin immediately before hair removal is ideal for the reduction of friction. This will help prevent damage to your skin (important after exfoliation) and, in the case of an epilator, allow for more efficient removal of hair by preventing the tweezer head from getting slowed down by dragging across your skin.

---------

So that's it! You should be a pro at healthy and efficient skin preparation for you hair removal method of choice. Following these practices not only makes for a more efficient and pleasant hair removal experience

There are three other important universal tips when it comes to the actual process of hair removal:

1. **Always use a sharp/clean tool**. This not only helps with better hair removal

2. **Always try to remove hair in the same direction as it is growing (with the grain.)** This not only helps reduce irritation, but it also gives you a longer period of time between hair removal sessions! **EDIT**: See [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1d8c1u/guide_hair_removal_skin_preparation_and_you_a/c9o90oh) with more information from /r/wicked_edge regarding shaving with the grain and against the grain.

3. **Always moisturize after removing hair**. Moisturizing your skin after what can be a traumatic experience for it will drastically reduce any irritation you have from the hair removal experience and ultimately also aids in preventing in-grown hairs. This is especially critical for areas where there is continuous skin-on-skin contact (eg

1374625390.0,1ix7q3,How I got rid of my reoccuring monster zit,Ecm563,268,40,113,"Hi SCA friends! I had THE LARGEST pimple of my life three days before my best friend's wedding last week. I fixed it within 24 hours and didn't have to deal with the embarrassing photos with a giant red monster on my cheek. I used a combination of things I've read here

First, there he is again in the same spot. Satan usually starts out as a whitehead that turns into a small cyst. This time around, Satan decided to start showing up about a week before the wedding I mentioned. I tried to leave it alone, but I knew that it would be a gruesome raised bump by the time the wedding that no amount of makeup could cover up.

So I took matters into my own hands. After I got home from work about 3 days before the big event I took a shower. Satan was pretty plump and ready to pop (I know, mouth, or nose. Do not wash your face with any cleansers after you apply it because it could render the antimicrobial inactive. It works it's magic even after you irrigate the excess off your face by breaking down the membrane of the bacteria (gram positive and gram negative for you nerds out there). I let my face air dry after irrigating the excess hibiclens off. I substituted the 3M nexcare acne patches that everyone raves about with some hydrocolloid patches that I use on patients (it's honestly the same as the nexcare patches). You can find them at cvs as tough hydrocolloid pads. I cut one of the pads down to the size of Satan and slapped it on him for 24 hrs (luckily I had the next day off work).

When I finally peeled off the patch the following day, especially since you run the risk of scaring and PIH, but it def helps with those pesky giants that can ruin pictures and self esteem. I hope it helps!!

EDIT:

*Just to reinforce this: Hibiclens is an antimicrobial that is VERY irritating to your eyes, or have any kind of reaction to it before putting it on your face.

*This is just what worked for me. I really do hope it does for you as well

*Fair warning to anyone with super sensitive skin- some of the hydrocolloid patches are very very adhesive and can be quite irritating when removing them. Usually the longer they stay on

*Just putting a hydrocolloid patch on a closed pimple isn't going to do a whole lot, you REALLY run the risk of serious scaring (but you knew that already). 

*I am not a doctor

*AND WOW. I had no idea that this post would become popular. I will come up with a new post on my skin care regimen (oh and I'll include pics). Thanks so much kids!!

**Background**: Oil Cleansing was never very popular in the US

**Why does it work?** The principle that causes oil to dissolve oil is called dissolution theory. I think part of the reason people experience such great success with this type of cleansing is that in people with dehydrated oily skin

**Who Should Try it?** Anyone can try it. If you find regular cleansers too harsh, and skin that's oily from dehydration.
I personally was oily and acne prone due to dehydrated skin. I never realized I was dehydrated until I tried the OCM. 


**OK

Before we get started, cause super crazy bad breakouts. If someone is seriously acne prone, it might be really hard find out what oil actually works.* Acne prone folks should gear towards oils that have bactericidal and/or anti inflammatory properties.

That said, and it paid off.

**How to Oil Cleanse:**

- You can use any one or multiple oils in any combination you like. They have different properties and will produce different results. Watch it with the castor oil
- Some popular choices are: Mineral oil, meadowfoam oil, jojoba oil, coconut oil (watch it with this one, this can cause crazybad breakouts in some people). You can get olive, sunflower, coconut in the cooking aisles at grocery stores

1. Wet your face with warm water. Not hot
2. Apply oil. You can premix it and store it or just use it directly from a container (make sure it's sterile though
3. Massage oil into face for a minute or two
4. Wipe oil off with warm washcloth after massage
5. One or two drops of olive oil or another oil may be used to moisturize the skin after the cleansing oil has been removed from the face. Personally I like to use argan oil.

1. Gently exfoliate with a exfoliating glove and a bit of body wash with Salicylic acid on it. I use the Pink Grapefruit Neutrogena one because it’s the same one I use for my bacne. Warning: Do not overdo this cause you might irritate the skin.

2. Use a no-scent moisturizing shave cream. I found this [Alba Botanica]( http://www.vitacost.com/alba-botanica-very-emollient-natural-moisturizing-cream-shave-unscented) at Whole Foods. A little goes a LONG way. It doesn’t irritate my skin at all and it doesn’t leave a residue-y feeling afterwards.

3. Rinse it all well with cold water

4. Use witch hazel astringent pads (Thayer’s) and gently apply it to all the shaved area.

5. After legs are dry, I just chose coconut because it was the cheapest but if you have acne sensitivities you might want to find one that is non-comedogenic.

The bumps have disappeared almost completely

This might seem like a lot of work

1364938151.0,1bjjwc,Teach It Tuesday - Post Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH),niccig,166,24,30,"The question of how to get rid of post-acne dark spots has been coming up a lot lately

**First

This post will focus on post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, I’ll leave some descriptions here for the sake of knowledge.

*Hypertrophic scarring* - raised lumps of scar tissue where an acne lesion was. Sometimes there is an overgrowth of scar tissue that extends beyond the original inflammation site (keloid scarring). This type of scarring is common on the torso.

*Atrophic scarring* - depressions in the skin due to a loss of collagen. Depending on the shape and area covered

**What is PIH

Post-inflammatory hyper pigmentation (PIH) results from an overproduction of melanin following inflammation of the skin. Cytokines and inflammatory mediators can have a stimulatory effect on melanocytes, including acne, dermatitis or traumatic injury, and can exist at the dermal and/or epidermal layers. While it isn't physically harmful, many people seek treatment due to the social and emotional effects.  

**What are the risk factors?**

PIH can occur in anyone. However, showing up as red, purple, brown or bluish. There's also a correlation between the intensity of the original inflammation and the intensity of the resulting PIH. Repeated inflammation at the same site (such as reoccurring acne cysts) can exacerbate the effect. 

**Well

PIH is notorious for taking a long time to treat, but the second best is to be prompt about treating any skin conditions that might cause it. Also avoid doing anything that causes inflammation to become worse (I'm looking at you, pimple-poppers!).

**I already have it! How do I make it go away?**

Fortunately there are lots of well-studied treatments for PIH. Below are some of the most-researched topical treatments.

**Sunscreen** - These treatment options increase the skin’s sensitivity to the sun, but they’ll actually cause additional photo damage to the skin. Used on its own, sunscreen can help prevent any existing hyperpigmentation from becoming worse.

*Retinoids* - These vitamin A derivatives are commonly prescribed for acne but can also assist in fading hyperpigmentation. They work by increasing epidermal turnover, dryness and irritation. Retinoid dermatitis can lead to additional hyperpigmentation, especially in darker skin, so it can be beneficial to start with a lower-strength retinoid and gradually increase the amount and frequency of use. Retinoids can be prescribed by your doctor.

*Chemical Peels* - Superficial chemical peels with alpha hydroxy acids are common treatments for PIH since they are generally well-tolerated. Chemical peels work by promoting exfoliation and dispersing basal layer melanin. Glycolic, the concentration of the active and how long the peel is left on the skin, the ‘depth’ of the peel can be controlled. Potential side effects include a burning sensation, redness, and skin irritation/sensitivity. Salicylic acid can potentially cause dryness, especially for people with drier skin types. Excessive irritation can lead to additional hyperpigmentation, so it’s important to choose the ingredients and strength of the peel carefully, and kits are also available for use at home.

*Vitamin C*- The antioxidant properties can help suppress melanin synthesis. Other benefits include anti-inflammatory effects and possible photoprotective properties. L-ascorbic acid, so vitamin C products should be chosen and stored carefully. It is most effective when combined with other treatments. Vitamin C is available in many OTC products.

*Daily AHAs* - In addition to use as peeling agents

*Azelaic Acid* - This is a dicarboxylic acid that was developed for the treatment of acne and rosacea. In addition to fighting acne by killing bacteria and decreasing keratin production, burning, irritation or allergic reaction. Azelaic acid (commonly sold under the brand name Finacea) can be prescribed by your doctor.

*Niacinamide* - a form of vitamin B3. It works by inhibiting melanosome transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes. Clinical studies seem to be using a concentration of at least 4%. In general

**How long will it take to go away?**

The healing process is somewhat unique for each person, the treatments you choose, and your consistency in applying the treatment. In some cases, it may exist long-term or permanently. For many people, especially those with darker skin, a minimum of 3-6 months of treatment is necessary before significant improvements are visible, and it could take a year to several years before the condition is completely resolved.

1363668338.0,1akqed,"Dehydrated Skin: What is it, what it looks like, and how to care for it",JoanOfSarcasm,171,85, or combination skin and can be aggravated by topical skin care as much as lifestyle (binge drinking or smoking

It's hard to describe dehydrated skin, it's generally skin that appears lackluster and dull, sallow or ""tired,"" and when pulled taut, it almost seems to wrinkle a bit. Dehydrated skin doesn't ""bounce back"" easily and is more prone to congestion (bumps, blackheads) and acne. It generally soaks up moisturizer yet looks oily in spots and feels dry as a bone in others.

The first thing to consider, but you should be drinking 4-6 glasses a day. 

Another facet of moisture is how much moisture is around your skin and what is on your skin to drink that moisture up (and hold it to the skin itself). For people in drier environments or simply those of us prone to dry or dehydrated skin

You also want to be paying attention to what kind of ingredients are holding moisture to your skin and how you are using them. I'm talking humectants here, and squalene.

[Glycerin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol) is easily the most recognizable and common humectant. It should never be applied straight, I recommend against doing this during the day, since it can make skin more ""shiny"" and sticky. 

Glycerin is found in most skincare products and is widely available. It is also an acne trigger in a small number of people.

[Hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) is a naturally derived ingredient that can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water. It is very light, but is also becoming more widely used in creams and lotions. It is best applied to damp skin (not sopping wet, but not completely patted dry either) during your water-soluable phase. If you're using it as a serum, follow it with a rich moisturizer.

Some people find hyaluronic acid drying. Your mileage may vary.

Some examples of products containing hyaluronic acid:

* SERUM. [Garden of Wisdom Hyaluronic Acid Serums](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/hyaluronic.html) are fabulously light-weight and effective. They are also very reasonably priced. You can purchase a sampler pack to try

* CREAMS AND LOTIONS. [CeraVe](http://www.lovelyskin.com/products.asp?MID=119) products are fabulous if they work well for your skin. I'm sure readers of this subreddit get tired of hearing us talk about CeraVe, and contain great skincare ingredients, such as niacinimide, hyaluronic acid, and ceramides ([which may be beneficial for eczema in some people](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18306855)). It is recommended that you spot test CeraVe products if you are acne-prone.

* UK OPTION. [Hydraluron Moisture Booster](http://www.boots.com/en/Hydraluron-Moisture-Booster-From-Indeed-Labs-the-people-who-brought-you-Nanoblur_1262210/) is available from Boots and may be a great choice for people who are not sensitive to algae ingredients and just want a basic

[Squalene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squalene) is a natural, is a hydrogenated derivative that has longer shelf life, but she has a lower cost and is therefore more profitable in cosmetic applications. People who have a sensitivity to olives or break out from topical use of olive oil should spot test products with squalene before using. 

Some examples of products containing squalene/squalane:

* US OPTION 1. [Solvere](http://www.lovelyskin.com/details.asp?PID=115991&amp;amp;MID=545&amp;amp;PG=1) is a regularly recommended

* US OPTION 2/UK OPTION 1. [La Roche-Posay Toleraine Fluid](http://www.dermstore.com/product_Toleriane+Facial+Fluid_677.htm) is a cosmetically elegant

* UK OPTION 2. [Oilatum Natural Repair Face Cream](http://www.boots.com/en/Oilatum-Natural-Repair-Face-Cream_9627/) is a fabulous option for UK residents on a tight budget. It is a great little moisturizer that packs quite a punch for roughly £8.

Your success with the various humectants are very individual. Some people prefer hyaluronic acid for their extra moisture while others prefer glycerin. Whatever you choose

The next thing to consider when aiding dehydrated skin is your product usage. Are you using several topicals that dry or irritate skin? Some examples of irritating ingredients are:

* Salicylic acid
* Benzoyl peroxide
* Tea tree oil
* Topical acne medications (Rx treatments, Retin-a Micro, Differin, and Tazorac)
* Sulfur topicals (such as Murad's spot treatment [3%]

If you're not using any of these ingredients but feel your skin is dehydrated, not squeaky clean. Some common cleansing ingredients and products that cause dry skin in many (but not all) people:

* African black soap
* Plain ol' bar soap
* Dr Bronner's soap
* Acne cleansers
* Cleansers with SLS or SLES
* Drying clay masks used too frequently (such as Aztec Secret Indian Clay Mask)

If you're using an irritating non-RX product, sunscreen).

If it's an RX product you're using

For those of you using a harsh cleanser (*glare*) or one that makes you feel dry and tight after use, such as CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser or Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. This will cleanse the skin without stripping it of its much-needed moisture.

The most important thing with skincare is listening to your skin and working with it rather than fighting against it's nature. When skin is dehydrated and breaking out, gentle regimen, and your skin has had time to heal (1-2 weeks), you may gradually begin to re-introduce potential irritants such as benzoyl peroxide or tea tree oil.

Hopefully this post has been helpful and answers questions I see many of you posing every day. Please feel free to ask questions and I will do my best to answer them!

First, old sebum, *and dead skin*. You over-do this and you get break-outs -- the ol' ""Clarisonic purging,"" which isn't purging at all but merely irritation from too much exfoliation. 

I also want to point out that the dermatologist that has authored the report regarding cleansing with the Clarisonic (Cosmetic Dermatology, **most** makeup requires a double-cleansing with an oil-based cleanser to remove all traces of foundation, concealer, mascara, etc.

Furthermore, was also paid for the company that sells Clarisonic (Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, June 2006, pg 181-183).

In short

Now, pores, or even necessarily blemishes. Have realistic expectations before you splurge on it!

With that said

* DO double cleanse if you're wearing makeup. Remove your makeup first with an oil-based cleanser and your hands. Rinse. Cleanse with your Clarisonic.
* DON'T use more than 3x a week if your skin is sensitive. Unless your skin is very tough
* DO back off on your Clarisonic usage if you see unusual breakouts or redness and irritation. This is skin irritation from over-exfoliation.
* DON'T use the Clarisonic if you have Rosacean skin or are prone to broken capillaries.
* DO be careful when using a Clarisonic on acne-prone skin
* DON'T press hard! It only takes gentle pressure to exfoliate your skin
* DO be careful about using a Clarisonic in tandem with retinoids or retinols
* DON'T be tempted to use more scrubs on your face or over-do it with the AHA/BHA while using the Clarisonic. It provides ample exfoliation for most skin types -- trust me! Using your Clarisonic 2-3x a week and your AHA 2-3x a week (PM) is enough (in fact
* DO change your brush heads every 3-4 months with new ones. 
* DON'T keep your Clarisonic in the shower
* DO clean it frequently with antibacterial soap or alcohol. 
* DON'T use the Clarisonic in conjunction with anything gritty. It will ruin the motor (and possibly irritate your skin).
* DO listen to your skin -- no matter whether it's with a Clarisonic or an AHA or a washcloth or even a new cleanser. Your skin knows what it needs. Learn to identify the signs of product breakouts or irritation breakouts and you're on your way to clearer

 Quoted from the text: 


There are four main classes of moisturizers: occlusives, and rejuvenators.



**Occlusives**


Occlusives work by forming a hydrophobic layer on the surface of the skin providing an exogenous barrier to water loss. Because they prevent evaporation from the skin



Although occlusives are not the most appealing of ingredients to consumers, the prototypic occlusive, it is actually the most effective moisturizer and reduces transepidermal water loss by 99% [7]. Petrolatum is the most commonly used active agent in skin care products, after water [1]. Occlusives are well tolerated among individuals and are often used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. A recent study [8] found that an over-the-counter (OTC) petroleum-based skin moisturizer (Aquaphor Healing Ointment, Beiersdorf, Wilton, CT) was as clinically effective in treating mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis as a more expensive ceramide containing prescription barrier cream. Petrolatum also can help restore the stratum corneum barrier by penetrating into its upper layers and initiating the production of intercellular lipids, sphingolipids



Dimethicone is the second most common active agent in moisturizers today because like petrolatum, and nonacnegenic [10]. Dimethicone is among a family of silicones that comprise the basis of all oil-free moisturizers [1]. However, petrolatum is superior to dimethicone in decreasing fine facial lines of dehydration or for healing skin [9]. Dimethicone is permeable to water vapor and therefore if the skin barrier is compromised, dimethicone will not reduce transepidermal water loss. This however is beneficial in some foundations and sunscreens, in that it allows for the evaporation of perspiration, preventing the skin from feeling warm developing miliaria [1]. Like petrolatum, dimethicone can also act as an emollient.




**Humectants**



This second major class of moisturizers are able to increase the water content of the skin by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis. Some also think that humectants are able to hydrate the stratum corneum by absorbing water from the external environment [11]. In contrast to occlusives, these compounds can cause excessive water loss from the dermis through evaporation into the lower humidity environment. This occurs especially if the skin barrier is compromised. Because of this phenomenon, in formulations humectants are always combined with occlusives that prevent water loss. Humectants include hydroxy acids, propylene glycol, and urea.



The most common humectant used in moisturizers is glycerol or glycerin. This hydroscopic compound is the most effective humectant and can also activate transglutaminase activity in the stratum corneum, aquaporin-3 expression is increased in human skin diseases, with elevated transepidermal water loss [1]. Overall, when combined with occlusive agents, glycerin has the ability to produce significant moisturizing effects in the skin.



**Emollients**


This class of moisturizer is used to improve the appearance and texture of skin by filling in the crevices between corneocytes. This contributes to increased softness and smoothness of the skin and improves its overall appearance. Some common emollients include essential fatty acids



**Rejuvenators**



This final class of moisturizers is intended to replenish essential proteins in this skin. Collagen, a considerable limitation to rejuvenators is their difficulty penetrating of the stratum corneum [12]. Although rejuvenators may not be able to successfully replenish proteins in the dermis, they can have a role similar to emollients and improve skin appearance by creating a film that aesthetically smoothes the skin and stretches out and fills in fine lines.



**Ceramides**



Although not a class of moisturizer, ceramides have been added to many moisturizes used in the treatment of both atopic and normal skin. Because ceramides are oil soluble, they can easily be incorporated into moisturizers; however, many products with ceramides, especially prescription formulations, can be prohibitively expensive [6]. Although ceramides have been shown to improve barrier function of damaged skin [3], recent studies have shown that inexpensive OTC nonceramide products can be just as effective in treating mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis [3].

**To start, held together by a ""glue."" AHA works by loosening up this glue and letting the cells fall away easier. This helps to reveal brighter, healthier, and plumper skin beneath. It is most commonly found in the following three forms: Glycolic, lactic, and mandelic. 

* **Glycolic**. The most common of all the AHAs
* **Lactic**. The second most common of all the AHAs. This is the basis for the beloved St. Ives pads. The molecular structure is larger than AHA but not as large as mandelic. It is highly recommended for sensitive skin types
* **Mandelic**. The least common

Many studies also have proven that AHAs increase dermal thickness and improve collagen density as well as quality of elastic fibers.

* [SOURCE 1](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)
* [SOURCE 2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x/abstract;jsessionid=8F1BD9BC1178A87ADF7E90B6EBD17F44.d02t02?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;amp;userIsAuthenticated=false)

AHAs are a great choice for dry skin -- they all have some humectant properties (meaning they hold moisture to the skin) and are water-soluable. This means they work best on bare

If you are using the OCM, however. 

If you wish to buffer AHA

Your routine would look something like this (water soluble -&gt; oil soluble):

* Cleanse -&gt; Pat dry -&gt; Toners -&gt; AHA -&gt; Serums -&gt; Moisturizers -&gt; Any additional occlusives (ie. Vaseline) -&gt; Sunscreen

AHAs do increase photosensitivity

I also recommend only using an AHA 3x a week, introduce them every third night and build up to every other night until you know your tolerance.

Moving on...

**BHA is short for ""Beta Hydroxy Acid.""** BHAs are a bit more complicated than AHAs. They work by penetrating the pore and essentially ""degunking."" This is what makes them preferred for oily and acne-prone skin

For the purpose of this post, it is not advised to use salicylic acid products if you have an asprin allergy. 

Salicylic acid has no humectant properties, such as benzoyl peroxide. It is also oil soluble, so don't worry about your OCM messing with it's effectiveness!

The most commonly recommended BHA on this subreddit is Stridex ""in the red box"" since it is alcohol-free. However, check out [the 2% BHA Liquid](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/aha-and-bha-exfoliants/_/Skin-Perfecting-Two-Percent-BHA-Liquid-Exfoliant/). It is not as gentle as the ""regular strength,"" despite also being 2%. This is likely due to the other ingredients that act as a delivery system for the product.

**[Also

Your routine will look identical to the routine above for AHAs when using BHAs: 

* Cleanse -&gt; Pat dry -&gt; Toners -&gt; AHA -&gt; Serums -&gt; Moisturizers -&gt; Any additional occlusives (ie. Vaseline) -&gt; Sunscreen

This is because *most treatments work best when applied to clean

Same thing as AHAs -- If you are new to BHAs

**So in summary:**

* AHAs - Drier skin types. ""Unglues"" dead skin. Glycolic
* BHAs - Oilier skin types. ""Degunks"" pores. Salicylic acid. Can be drying. Does not cause photo-sensitivity. Can use AM or PM. 
* They CAN be used together

Next, and **[Test patch](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/14sd25/i_just_learned_how_to_do_a_test_patch_properly/).**  .

If you can't seem to find a particular product in your country, [iherb](http://www.iherb.com/), and [mmmule](http://mmmule.com/).  

Now


- **Cleanser** 

  We frequently tell folks it's not necessary to cleanse 2x a day

  If your skin is feeling tight/dry/squeaky after cleansing

  *Cleanser Recs*
  
  ~ Cerave Foaming (US/Canada): Suitable for acne prone

  ~ Cerave Hydrating (US/Canada): Better for non-acne prone/dry

  ~ Spectro Jel (US/Canada): Suitable for acne-prones

  ~ Boots Sensitive Foaming Wash (UK/US/Canada/other?): Potentially suitable for all skin types

  ~ Eucerin DermatoClean

  ~ [Oil Cleansing](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/): Suitable for almost all skin types

  
- **Exfoliation**

  Chemical exfoliation is the preferred method on /r/skincareaddiction

  Lactic acid is the most gentle, start with a BHA (salicylic acid). If you are combo, and want the humectant benefits of an AHA, try Mandelic---partly oil soluble AHA. 

  Physical exfoliation (yes this includes a washcloth and the Clarisonic!) should not be used more than 1-2x a week, flaking, or irritated skin.

  Exfoliation will be beneficial if you have any of the following concerns (not comprehensive): zits, blackheads, whiteheads, dull skin, dry skin, [sebaceous filaments (SFs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fmg0t/some_more_information_about_sebaceous_filaments/), etc.

  Since AHAs/BHAs work at a lower pH to exfoliate

  *BHA exfoliator recs (alcohol free)*

  ~ Stridex Maximum Strength Pads aka Stridex in the red box (US/available on iherb or Vitacost): If known serious sensitivity to light fragrance/menthol proceed with caution. These tend to work fine for the majority of people

  ~ Paula's Choice BHAs (Worldwide): Fragrance-free options

  ~ BravuraLondon (UK): Various BHA products

  *AHA exfoliator recs*

  ~ St Ives Scrub Free Exfoliating Pads (US): 4-5% lactic acid. If very sensitive to fragrance or known fruit allergies

  ~ Silk Naturals AHA Toner (US based but will ship to some international locations): 8% Lactic acid. Contains aloe. Fragrance-free.

  ~ Paula's Choice AHAs (Worldwide): Varying concentrations of glycolic acid

  ~ Olay Regenerist Night Resurfacing Elixir (Worldwide): 8-10% glycolic acid

  ~ BravuraLondon (UK): Varying Glycolic/lactic/ AHA+BHA combos

  ~ Alpha Hydrox Oil Free Gel (US/ Parent company may ship international to some locations): 10% glycolic acid

  ~ Alpha Hydrox Swipes or Intensive Serum ( US/ Parent company may ship international to some locations): 14% glycolic acid

  ~ MUAC Mandelic Serum (US/ ships internationally): 10% mandelic acid

  ~ Avene Cleanance K (US/Canada/Europe/Aussie/possibly other locations): AHA/BHA product.  2% Lactic

- **Moisturize**

  Everyone needs a moisturizer

  *Moisturizer Recs*

  ~ Cerave Cream aka Cerave in the tub (US/Canada): Suitable for any skin type. Also works for the body. Fast absorbing
  
  ~ Oilatum Natural Repair (UK): Suitable for any skin type. Similar to Cerave in the tub

  ~ Cetaphil Lotion/Cream (Many locations worldwide): Suitable for any skin type. Slightly greasier formula to Cerave in the tub. 

  ~ Vaseline  (Worldwide): Suitable for any skin type. Good to add on top of moisturizer

  ~ EltaMD Intense Moisturizer (US): Vaseline alternative


- **Sunscreen**

  This is your choice, benzoyl peroxide, or you're on particular oral medications.

  Proper amount for application is 2mg/cm^2. This is about 1/4 teaspoon (~1.2 mL) for the face alone. Reapplication should be every 1.5-2 hours (maybe even more depending on how nasty the UV index will be that day)

  Recommendations highly vary depending on location and type of finish you prefer. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/15tuqd/for_those_interested_in_trying_out_new_susncreens/) sidebar link on sunscreens gives you all you need to know.  Also

  Generally

- **Spot Treatments/Masks**

  This will vary based on your skin type

  *Spot Treatments to Consider*

  ~ Benzoyl Peroxide cream/wash:  If in a wash

  ~ Sulfur ointment/cream: Tends to be less irritating than BP

  ~ Tea Tree Oil: Should be diluted with a carrier oil to avoid a chemical burn. Avoid if prone to allergic contact dermatitis. Potent fragrance.

  ~ Neem Oil: Very potent fragrance 

  ~ Clay masks: These will help clear pores and help bring some acne to a head.    Bentonite is the strongest

warning: this might be long and/or confusing

my skin type: I am not sure what type of skin I have.  I know I have sensitive acne prone skin.  but it is often dry and flakey.  the only time I get oily is when I am wearing makeup, then it will calm down after my monthly cycle ends.  

other problems: I get very bad cystic acne deep in my skin. I usually only get these on my chin or around my mouth

what ive tried to do: first of all let me say i cant afford to go to a derm, then i use face moisturizer.  but i have just started using OCM with castor oil and avocado oil.  I have done A TON of research on this before i started so Im almost positive im doing it right BUT i got a HUGE HARD cyst on my chin the day after starting :(

other products i may use:
lush's celestial moisturizer
LUSH enchanted eye cream

its supposed to even hyper pigmentation
INGREDIENTS: aqua, hydroxproline, coco caprylate/caprate, cetearyl glucoside, olive, glycerin*, aloe barbadensis leaf juice*, grape seed oil*, avacodo oil*, calendula officinalis flower extract

OSEAS red algae mask: HG mask for me at the moment. when i have a cystic acne break out it soothes my face and helps ease the pain and i always feel like my acne is less inflamed and my skin has a slight glow after using this. i use this 1x a week but not every week...
INGREDIENTS:  red algae gel extract, cocoglucoside and coconut alcohol, sodium lauroyl oat amino acid, French red clay, frech pink clay, magnesium aluminum, silicate, multifruit extract, chamomile extract, calendula extract

i also have a face lotion that i use on my infant son

**Additional Information: When should I suspect something is infected**

*Symptoms of infection may include:*

1. Increased pain, or warmth around the affected area.

2. Red streaks extending from the affected area.

3. Drainage of pus from the area.

4. Fever.

*Elaboration*

- **Warmth**: An infection may feel hot to the touch. This happens as the body sends infection fighting blood cells to the site of infection. 

- **Swelling/Hardening of the Area**: An infection may begin to harden as the tissue underneath are inflamed. 

- **Redness**: An area that gets red

- **Drainage From the Incision/Wound**: Foul-smelling drainage or pus may begin to appear on an infection. It can range in color from blood-tinged to green, chunky.

- **Pain**: Your pain should slowly and steadily diminish as you heal. If your pain level increases for no apparent reason

1360085978.0,17xxtx,Teach it Tuesday: Coconut Oil!,red_wine_and_orchids,103,12,72,"There's been a lot of confusion about coconut oil - whether it's occlusive


First of all, as is petrolatum (Vaseline) - petrolatum is just made up of larger alkanes, so it becomes a solid instead of a liquid.


Several double-blind studies have been performed to compare the performance of coconut oil to other oils.  In one study, skin lipid levels and skin pH were compared between coconut oil and mineral oil [1].  It was found  ththat coconut oil and mineral oil performed similarly to each other, due to their similar saturated hydrocarbon nature (the saturated hydrocarbons are hydrophobic, and this gives them their occlusive properties).  In another study, the antibacterial action of coconut oil vs. olive oil on *Staphylococcus aureus* was examined [2].  It was found that coconut oil had a greater antibacterial action than olive oil.  It's thought that the saturated triglycerides in coconut oil are broken down on the skin by bacterial action into monoglycerides, particularly the compound monolaurin.  Monolaurin has been clinically shown to be bactericidal [refs in 2].  As olive oil doesn't have as much saturated fat as coconut oil, it's thought that this is why it does not have as much antibacterial action.  In addition


Finally, and several vegetable oils into the skin and their effect on the skin [3, 4].  It was found that the oils and petrolatum only penetrate the top layer of the skin, and the oils all caused modest swelling (10-20%) of the stratum corneum (a measure of their occlusive properties/hydration), while petrolatum caused moderate swelling (60%).  In addition, transepidermal water loss was similar for all the oils (moderate) while petrolatum had minimum transepidermal water loss.  While coconut oil was not tested (jojoba, sweet almond oil, and avocado were)

Dark circles/wrinkles under the eye are very common issues that get brought up. I thought in the interim it would be helpful to chat about some common causes and ways to treat these. 


** Products**

I mention Vitamin C serums and Retinoids quite a bit in this post.    OTC retinoids I trust are by the brand Avene--available in many parts of Europe and the US.  Avene's eye gels/creams are the only true eye cream I will endorse on here until another cost efficient, please post.  Vitamin C serums that are good include those by: Nufountain, Silk Naturals, &amp;  MUAC Pretty much if you can find one with a good pH and well packaged, it would do the trick.


**Under Eye Wrinkles**     


 More likely than not, they've always been there.    


Now what will help actual wrinkles? Suncreen to prevent further damage


**Dark Circles**

There are 3 main causes of dark circles

**1. Hyperpigmentation**

This is darkening of the skin under your eye. If this is the cause


Things that definitely are known to reduce hyperpigmentation are AHAs --be very careful with this, and even another RX topical that I'm not mentioning due to to the harshness/side effects/ link to cancer. The latter can be discussed with a physician if ever other treatment under the sun failed and you're truly miserable, I'm not even sure it's safe for use around the eye.



**2. Visible capillaries due to very thin skin:**


The skin under the eye is thin and delicate. Due to this

 You can either go to your derm or local med spa and get these zapped with a laser or

Retinoids/(possibly)Vitamin C  can also help to thicken the skin over time as well. 



**3. Tear Trough/Suborbital Volume Deficiency**


This is literally due to the structure below your eye.   Nothing topically applied will cure this


For the tear trough, which gives the look of dark circles or contributes to your circles.  [Example](http://i.imgur.com/BGbsKve.jpg)


For suborbital volume deficiency




**Vitamin K cream disclaimer**


Some people claim that eye creams with vitamin K work ( with spider veins/ visible caps) by penetrating skin and clotting the vessels/capillaries


Consistent evidence is lacking on the efficacy of this


Though


If you guys have anything to add please do!  Hope you enjoyed it!



**EDIT** fixed links!   Also, lack of sleep ( so make sure you're getting enough sleep, however many hours is good for *you*, no one size fits all for sleep), stress/emotional problems, and allergies.

1374883853.0,1j4rgd,Four months of the acne.org regimen (progress pictures),cyberwin,102,17,21,"http://imgur.com/a/tfn8V

Hey everyone!  I've been meaning to post these photos for a while.  I went my entire life with clear skin, US to Melbourne, Australia and my skin went insane! I wasn't sure if it was the change in climate or some crazy hormones that just happened to go haywire at the same time as my move (and i'm still not sure!).  

Anyway, my doctor prescribed me epiduo and my skin HATED it.  It got so brutal and my breakouts went from 6 spots on a cheek to 20-30 per cheek.  After doing some reading on the clinical trials of epiduo, I was not at all pleased with the results and didn't want to waste my time for what may have been something around a 30% success rate.  

So after hearing a lot of people rave about acne.org, and a moisturizer and doing this twice a day.  It took four months but now my skin is almost entirely clear.  I still have post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, but I'm not so upset about it anymore

My regimen now (as acne.org shipping to australia is so ridiculous) is-

AM and PM

-oil-cleanse with grapeseed oil

-tone with alcohol-free witch hazel

-apply one finger length of 2.5% benzoyl peroxide (i'm looking to stop using the BP after my current tube runs out)

-apply a mixture of water

1367267862.0,1dd15z,[UPDATE] Laser Hair Removal Adventures: I did it! Session #1 Follow-Up + Pictures.,spunky-omelette,97,11,66,"Last time

I [posted about a scheduled consultation(s)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ch673/i_just_scheduled_a_consultation_for_laser_hair/)

So to recap, weight is perfect, acne is decent, etc etc).  However, I've always been very fluffy, especially my arms.  Having dark hair + pale skin is apparently the best type to be if you are looking for laser hair removal, which is why I have been considering this. 

Laser hair removal is really more of a *reduction*--you go for several sessions to get as much hair as possible (because all your hairs are at different stages in their growth cycle).  If you are a good profile and the laser is a good match

I ended up selecting the second clinic I went to for a consultation.  I was pleased with how thorough they were in answering my questions, and their long-standing reputation.  They were very ""no-nonsense"" and did not try to push my anything.  Even though I asked a zillion questions (""IS AN AHA ON MY ARMS OKAY!?"")  they were awesome.  I chose to pay upfront for all sessions (pay for five, get the sixth free), since I figured given my hairiness it'd save money in the long run.  It wound up being cheaper than the other place I checked out as well.

**Pre-laser Prep**

This was really freaky stuff.  Before laser hair removal, plucked or really removed any of my arm hair before.  It was SUPER freaky--I felt extremely sensitive and.... tacky (not poorly-dressed tacky, but in a super-sensitive-tactile-way).  Even my sleeves made me feel kind of sick.  I used a very gentle sugar scrub to exfoliate first, since I didn't want to try anything with chemicals on an area I've never really done much with before.

**The Laser**

THE LASER HURTS, but lots of wincing, grimacing pains.  The clinic used a CynoSure laser, but first they applied the same kind of gel that is used for ultrasounds. The only purpose in this was to reduce discomfort. This particular laser machine blows very cold air on the area, and they maneuver a little gun inch by inch, delivering a beeping laser zap to each spot.  The squishy areas of my arms hurt most.  

The entire procedure

**Immediately After**

There was definitely redness and swelling.  Some descriptions online I read sounded like sunburn, and to stay away from any sort of sweat-inducing exercise + hot water.

This was awesome because I got out of dishes for a while... but anyways, and while it definitely isn't cosmetically elegant, I really would rather just be sure it gets the job done).

**One Week Later**

Still wearing sunscreen and now introducing exfoliation into my routine again.  I guess the hairs that are under the surface and have died are called ""pepper spots""--they're supposed to push out to the surface and look like they're growing, but I haven't used it since.

I really never paid a lot of attention to the *skin* on my arms... I've always been so preoccupied with hating the hair.  I feel like now is the time where a lovely relationship founded upon exfoliation

**TL;DR - Had my first laser hair removal session.  I have newfound respect for the skin on my arms and definitely want to pamper it!**

The epidermis is the top layer of skin


On the face

The major cell of the epidermis (which accounts for almost 95%) is the *keratinocyte*. Other cells include, and Merkel cells.
 

The facial epidermis is comprised of several layers ( we generally refer to #4 on ScA when we talk about exfoliation

1. *Stratum Basale (stratum germinativum)*: This is the base layer of the epidermis, but it can be even 2 or 3 layers thick depending on the type of skin (like glaborous) or for those with a hyperproliferative epidermis. As  keratinocytes are formed, they  get pushed up and at each new layer, gain more keratin. This layer is also where we have melanocytes (pigmentation), langerhans (immune), and merkel (for touch) cells. 
2. *Stratum Spinosum*: This is the prickly layer of the epidermis
3. *Stratum Granulosum*: This is where the keratinocytes lose their nucleus and can be considered granular cells (different sources are saying different things on what to call the cells
4. *Stratum corneum (SC)*: This is the topmost layer of the epidermis ( about 10-40 microns thick) This layer is comprised of *corneocytes* or the most matured keratinocytes--the cells are flattened out, and have now lost their cytoplasmic organelles. They are suspended in the lipid matrix that was released by lamellar bodies of the stratum granulosum. The corneocytes are attached together by *corneodesmosomes*. The corneocytes in the SC layers are not all in the same differentiated state.   *Desquamation* happens here,  when the body sloughs off the top layers of the SC, via releasing desquammatory enzymes to break the corneodesmosome bonds. The Natural Moisturizing Factor (NMF) is found in this layer and contributes to hydration. This layer is also what people commonly refer to as the ""dead layer"". This is also the layer we generally address when we talk about exfoliation, acid mantle, and barrier function. The combination of this layer plus the lipid layer is how we preserve said barrier function/acid mantle--this is a physical + chemical barrier.   This layer needs to be properly hydrated in order to keep skin nice and smooth.   




The entire process from formation of basal keratinocytes from the epidermal stem cells


**Extra Tidbits**

- Normal facial skin is around a pH of 4.5 - 5.5--This helps to ward off bacteria such as P. Acnes (responsible for acne). Those with impaired barrier function disorders such as eczema, which creates an ideal breeding ground for bacteria. This could in part be due to hyperkeratinization and lack of proper desquamation which leads to impaired barrier function (Source 4 has great acne videos/explanations)

- The desquamation/differentiation process can be shortened if the body is introduced to inflammation (either internally or externally). This is commonly seen on inflammatory skin lesions with dry/crusty scales. This scaling is actually incompletely differentiated corneocytes. Dandruff and psoriasis are examples of this. In the case of psoriasis, and exfoliators are commonly advised to help prevent this crusting.

- Trans Epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) is how barrier function is measured

- If you impair barrier function, and will take 10 days to repair. The lipid content remains normal, yet the amino acid content (like the NMF, responsible in hydration) remains low. Skin recovery is also impaired at a neutral or higher pH.   This is why when doing deeper chemical peels, physically exfoliating, etc you must focus on keeping skin hydrated as much as possible, it is also why using stripping cleansers is such a bad idea--as you are messing up your barrier function on a daily basis.

- Natural Moisturizing Factor (NMF) is comprised of amino acids or derivatives like pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (PCA) and urocanic acid, citrate, and sugars. The NMF is essentially a natural humectant.

- Scars less than one year old have increased TEWL and also could lack lipids.

- Intercellular lipids include: one of each type of ceramide

- Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) are thought to increase epidermal thickness via increasing hydration (possibly by the NMF) over time. While the full mechanism isn't understood, decrease corneocyte clumping, and promote individual corneocyte desquamation. Beta hydroxy acids (salicylic acid) break corneodesmosome bonds (why is why you can get dryness/peeling as a side effect), but don't lead to an increase in NMF and they are not keratolytics. They all work best under a pH of 4, with BHAs working optimally around a 3.

So first

The biggest change that I made that helped get rid of my acne was discontinuing hormonal birth control. Dual-hormone methods give me migraines

Without further ado

There's a sort of timeline in the picture descriptions if you click on the link (I don't think RES shows descriptions)

Past 2 years or so - tried various forms of topical antibiotics

October - started using Retin-A

November-ish - found this sub. Started getting dehydration under control by building up retinoid use gradually

December-Jan - gradual decrease in the frequency &amp; severity of breakouts.

Feb - had my first cortisone injection for a monster cyst (which fortunately seemed to be pretty isolated). Very pleased with the results

Mid-March - breakouts are small and infrequent

Now - So after all this, I'm going to start using the MUAC 40% glycolic peel, since glycolic is a bit stronger and I came across several mentions of it in medical studies on treatment of atrophic scarring. I'm also really interested in trying the dermaroller, but I'm not sure if combining that with retinoid use is a good idea :-) Luckily my skin isn't overly sensitive and I have a fairly high pain tolerance. I'd definitely be interested in hearing any experiences or advice.

My routine as of right now is:

**Morning:**

* Water rinse

* St Ives Exfoliating Pad

* Clindamycin lotion

* A small amount of First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream

* Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46

* Makeup

**Night:**

* Remove makeup with Yes To Cucumbers wipes

* Massage mineral oil in to dislodge any clogged pores and make sure makeup is all washed off

* Wash with CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (possibly an unnecessary step)

* Tazorac

* Generous amount of FAB Ultra Repair Cream

* Thin layer of Aquaphor

**Weekly:**

* MUAC 40% lactic peel for seven minutes

Several studies [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22863639) [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22594386) [3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22994859) did indicate that it is important to keep the skin well hydrated during scar and stretch mark healing. This can help lessen the appearance and severity of your stretch marks, bio oil, whatever your moisturizer of choice is, doesn't really matter.

7. Retin-A. I found [one study that says that Retin-A is very effective against stretch marks](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2312898) and [one study that says that Retin-A does not reduce the apperance of stretch marks](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7956336) However the second study has a sample size of 90 while the first study had a sample size of 20

8. [Daily application of a 20% Glycolic acid solution is also pretty effective](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9723049) Glycolic acid has the benefit of being cheap

9. I could not find anything about Bio Oil specifically but I would probably lump it in with point 6. Use it to keep your skin well hydrated if you like it.

I would cover up with makeup, but still cringe at the state of my face in the mornings and after taking my makeup off.    
    Recently I subscribed to both r/Makeupaddiction and r/Skincareaddiction and began to learn more about proper skin care. I also found acne.org and learned a lot about skin care from there as well. 

**My regimen now consists of:  
* Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser  
* 1 Pump of Acne.org 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide on my problem areas(Let that oxygenate for about 10 minutes)  
* Dermalogica skin smoothing cream mixed with 3-6 drops of jojoba oil.**

I poured through as many posts here as I could! Two weeks later, clean and so happy. The large pores on my face -I thought these were genetic and I was just simply doomed to watch silently as they got worse and worse - are so much less noticeable now.  Here's my routine: 

AM: 

* Wash with CeraVe foaming in the shower.

* Spot treat pimple with tea tree oil; spot treat old pimples (now red spots) and excessive dry spots with aloe vera oil; light tea tree oil over my forehead to reduce bumps

* Moisturize with CeraVe in the tub

* CeraVe face lotion SPF sunscreen - it takes a minute or two to soak in

PM:

* Wash with about a quater-sized dollop of my oil mix (1/2c sunflower oil

* massage face with baby/mineral oil; rinse

* wash with CeraVe foaming

* Exfoliate with St. Ives pads/Stridex red box (alternate days)

* Spot treat pimple with tea tree oil; spot treat old pimples (now red spots) and excessive dry spots with aloe vera oil; light tea tree oil over my forehead to reduce bumps

* Moisturize with CeraVe in the tub

Today I used the Stridex AM after using St. Ive's PM - my face was pretty dry after

So far, with so little blotchiness or spots, that I found that I *love* going mostly makeup-free. :) And I was a gal who wouldn't set *foot* outside without a totally done-up face! :D

1368350568.0,1e6d3p,[REMINDER] Please be careful when using retinoids and AHAs or BHAs (such as St Ives pads and Stridex in the box),JoanOfSarcasm,83,13,24,"Hey guys!

I've noticed this popping up lately and I just wanted to clarify for you all. Please, Retin-A Micro, Retin-A, and Renova (to name a few). 

I'm not going to go too much into detail because it's 4AM and I *really* need sleep, the average time of skin cell turnover in an adult is 28 days. In children it's closer to 14. Retinoids speed that back up. So you shed skin quicker (hence the snake-skin peeling), your skin burns, and is very irritable. It also thins out the ""dead skin"" cell portion of the epidermis over time and plumps the dermis, which is what makes it so great for combating wrinkles but so brutal if you don't wear adequate sunscreen.

So what does this have to do with exfoliators like AHA and BHA, retinoid-treated skin is *extremely delicate* skin. This means that it's more prone to broken capillaries or irritation. Now think of an AHA as a distant cousin of retinoids -- they also thin out the very top layer of skin. Using them both at the same time is generally bad news. Many people may experience irritation, redness, burning, dullness, and/or sensitivity. For others, they may experience an elevated number of break-outs (break-outs can be attributed to irritation -- too much rubbing, and chemical exfoliating can all cause this). 

BHA is similar

If you want to use AHAs with your retinoids

Also, I highly recommend oil cleansing/massages. This will allow you to moisturize your skin and *gently* remove the clumps of dead skin that you wake up with. **Stay away from harsh physical exfoliators, like the Clarisonic, during this breaking in period and never use them if your skin is at all prone to broken capillaries!** 

Keep in mind that everyone's skin is different, I urge you to err on the side of caution and love, as skin is so delicate while using retinoids. 


(*A side note about BHA and AHA used together, and we generally recommend against combining BHA and AHA *at the same time*. It's perfectly okay to use AHA in the evenings and BHA during the mornings **as long as you use sunscreen**.)

Before coming on here I was constantly plagued with closed comedones, but a combination of factors that I learnt off here. Before this subreddit, I was completely oblivious as to what to really do.

1. Really cut down on milk and cheese. I mean there are times where I'll have it like in an iced cappuccino like once a week but it's not an everyday thing anymore
2. Cut out breads. No more bagels!
3. I eat a better diet. A lot of fruits veggies, A, C, B complex and B6. Then I have a zinc tablet, fish oil capsule. 
4. I've started to exercise a little because I heard it increases circulation to the face and head and I really want to have better skin and maintain nice hair. 

Ok so here is my skincare routine. 
 In the morning
-I use my clarisonic plus with this neem facewash my mom got me when she went to India. She had gone in December and just brought it back for me because Neem in India is considered pretty holy grail. I had read a few things about it on here and decided to use it. It's a Neem and turmeric gel face wash. 
- I moisturize with either my tinted Nars moisturizer or the Cerave depending on whether I'll be staying in or going out. I had the lotion until today. I bought the tub today. Yay!
-Then I put on Sunscreen. At the moment I use Aveeno 30 SPF
- Then any make up such as blush and eyeliner

At night time
- I use the oil cleansing method with jojoba oil (THANK YOU GUYS). I've really liked the oil cleansing method. I haven't tried any other oils other than jojoba. But I'm really liking it so far. 
- I use my BHA by Paula's choice
- I then moisturize with Cerave lotion and sometimes I use Aloe Vera. Just depends on my mood. I like the nice cold
-  I've also started to put on jojoba oil on top after to seal in the moisturizer. Recently I've been using vaseline too sometimes.

Weekly Specials
- Aztec Healing Clay - LOVE THIS! 
- A Turmeric mask which I make at home and store in the fridge. I also love this, try yoghurt immediately after, it helps for me. I also put yoghurt into the mask as well.
- Paula's Choice Resurfacing 10% AHA (Love this too)
- I also randomly put on Manuka Honey and Tea Tree Oil if I ever get a spot on my face. I'm not sure if it helps
- I also use a brown sugar and honey scrub if my face feels too flakey especially after the AHA. I'm not sure if I should be exfoliating that flakey skin off but it hasn't done any damage so I guess it's okay
- Oh and I also have the Ocean Salt scrub from Lush which I do use occasionally especially if I have a party to go to. I'm not sure why

I'm also waiting on GoW's Glycolic Acid 10% pads. As well as African Black soap. I probably don't need these products

I do apologize for this post being long

So I did what everyone who browses this sub does - I bought the holy grail products. Cerave face wash, sunscreen, and witch hazel. I got so excited that I threw out my old products (Basis face wash, Desert Essences face wash, neutrogena creams, a couple moisturizers, and some more junk) to make room for my new and improved routine.

BAD IDEA. This new routine hated my skin more than any routine I've ever tried. I was so discouraged! My skin was breaking out bad

After asking the community, but boy was I wrong. He prescribed me Finacea 15% and told me to wash my face with Panoxyl (I got the walgreens brand instead - same thing). The difference was HUGE!

[See for yourself the 1 month transformation!](http://imgur.com/a/mZVUU)

So here is my routine:

Morning:  
Wash with Panoxyl (10%) or just rinse with water

Evening:  
Wash with Panoxyl (10%) twice. Apply Finacea to problem areas (around nose and mouth).

I do not moisturize. Every moisturizer I've tried has broken me out so bad. My skin is not dry (not oily either). It doesn't itch or flake. So right now I'm not using any moisturizer and my skin is totally okay with that.

What is thought to be taking place when dry skin occurs is that the intracellular matrix (the substances between skin cells that keep them intact, bringing about a rough, uneven, and flaky texture that allows water to be lost. But adding water won't keep that moisture in skin unless the outer barrier is maintained or repaired. To prevent dry skin, the primary goal is to avoid and reduce anything that damages the outer barrier, including sun damage, products that contain irritating ingredients, drying cleansers

I have pretty crappy cystic acne and have been doing pretty well lately, in the same place they always do. For some reason the ones in that place are always really really painful and disgusting. They hurt even when I'm not touching them (I only touch to wash or put on makeup), and it hurts to move my face. They usually take around 3-4 weeks to stop hurting, and then another month or so to flatten down. I've had pigmentation there for years because it keeps flaring up.

This time I decided not to screw around, reviewed my current prescriptions with me to make sure nothing had changed since last time I was there, and then the doc came in. She had me lay back on the table, cleaned the area with alcohol, and injected each of the two cysts. She cleaned it up a bit and had me hold some gauze on it for a minute or two while we talked - since I was there and clearly still having breakouts, she recommended switching from Retin-A to Tazorac cream. She was nice enough to grab me some samples so I can make sure my skin can handle it before I go pay for the prescription.

It *should* go without saying, in the form of hypopigmentation, atrophy of the tissue around the injection site (pitting) or infection. So far no weird infections, but it's too soon to tell if I'll see any scarring. I also found it to be quite painful, which is unsurprising - those particular spots were already plenty painful, and then the doc jabbed a needle in a couple times (as gently as possible though). Both spots throbbed for a good 30 minutes or so afterward. Twas not pleasant. And I had to go to work afterward.

So overall, big work presentations, whatever) it's an option that's definitely worth exploring. Dermatologists always seem to be booked up, so be sure to ask in advance how to go about making the appointment/under what conditions they'll do it (apparently it works best if you do it in the first few days).

We mods do our very best to weed out comments that give these wild claims without providing proper evidence to back them up. Ultimately, especially if it sounds *too good to be true* and relies on logic such as ""If it's natural, it must be good!"" / ""If it's got chemicals in it, it will slowly kill your skin!"" Both of these can be true for specific instances, but are definitely not right every single time.

Upon stumbling on this subreddit, I did not see other visible differences, and continued agonizing about the sebaceous filaments on my nose. Applying sunscreen everyday was the worst step because the sunscreen would stick? clump? to the SFs on my nose. So instead of black dots on my nose, now I had white dots sticking up on my nose. Great. Regardless, I continued on with this routine because I had to finish up my sunscreen (Neutrogena Pure &amp;amp; Free Liquid). I could feel the bumps from the SFs on my nose everyday, before and after sunscreen application.

Yet, and applied sunscreen. I did a double take as I noticed the absence of the white bumps on my nose. My nose looked... and felt... smooth!! The sunscreen didn't get caught on my SFs. At night, after cleansing and such, I examined my nose and found that my SFs were slightly lighter in color and smaller! I am now so glad I stuck with chemical exfoliation. :)

This is best diagnosed by your skin care professional -- the Internet is no substitute for your doctor's medical advice.

However, at-home ways I've learned how to cope with the condition.


**CLEANSE**

This is actually surprisingly important with KP. On a whim one night, I figured, ""Why not KP?""

SLS, also known as Sodium Laureth Sulfate, are common sulfates that add the 'suds' to some of your favourite household products -- from common toothpastes, body washes, and shampoo to dish soap, Prell shampoo, and laundry detergent. While there are health concerns over the effects of SLS, it should be noted that some people are more sensitive to the potentially drying effects of SLS and SLES than others

While this evidence is anecdotal, but I highly recommend trying it for a couple weeks. 

You may find SLS-free body washes at a health food store like Whole Foods or Trader Joe's. I have not found one yet at the common grocery store.


**MOISTURIZE**

When shopping for a moisturizer for KP, glycolic acid, or salicylic acid. Your experience with each may vary -- while I do well with glycolic acid and urea, other KP sufferers do not notice any difference when using these ingredients. Some favourite products with these ingredients (US bias):

* [Eucerin Intensive Repair](http://www.eucerinus.com/products/repair/eucerin-intensive-repair-very-dry-skin-lotion.html). This lotion is very thick. Some have described it's consistency to that of elmer's glue. It is very thick, apply a generous amount and work it into the skin, utilizing your body's own warmth to make it a more maneagable consistency. Recommended you apply it before bed.

* [CeraVe SA Renewing Skin Lotion](http://www.amazon.com/Cerave-Renewing-Skin-Lotion-Ounce/dp/B0071XPQQ2). Contains vitamin D and SA


* Coconut Oil. Some KP sufferers have found relief in coconut oil. Note that coconut oil should not be used if you have a coconut allergy and should never be used on the face without first spot testing

* [Amlactin](http://amlactin.com/) products. Smell a bit ""odd


**SOAKING**

When I began running, YMMV, but I felt it was worth noting.

I also recommend against taking scalding hot showers

This gives a snapshot of the classes of various common ingredients and their indications during pregnancy.  I believe even some oils should be avoided as well

As far as what is safe while trying to conceive or lactating
______________________________________________________________________________________
- *Class D or X ingredients that should definitely be avoided* (these are the generic names, spironolactone, tetracycline, 5-Fluorouracil, isotretinoin, tazoratone.


- *Oxybenzone* Active ingredient in sunscreen. Controversial

- *Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide* are physical sunscreens considered completely safe.

- *Salicylic acid* Class C.  A popular BHA chemical exfoliant (found in Stridex pads). High oral doses linked to pregnancy complications and birth defects. Occasional topic use is considered benign


- *Benzoyl peroxide* Class C. Because it is absorbed readily by skin

- *Retinoids* Class C for topical applications and Class D for oral (such as Accutane). Type of vitamin A popular in anti-aging products. High oral doses shown to cause fetal complications; topical applications in moderation are considered safe. [Link to types of retinoids](http://www.skinacea.com/retinoids/types-of-retinoids.html#.Ud4RetLOtIk)


- *Amoxicillin* Class B.  Antibiotic.  Sometimes used to treat rosacea.  Considered safe past the third trimester.

- *Clindamycin or erythromycin* Class B. Antibiotic. Sometimes used to treat acne or rosacea. Considered safe past the third trimester.

- *Azelaic acid (brand name Finacea)* Class B. Used to treat acne. Considered safe past the third trimester.
______________________________________________________________________________________
**Summary of the safety classes for ingredients

  **A**: *Controlled Studies Show No Risk*. Studies in pregnant women show the medication causes no increased risk to the fetus during pregnancy.


  **B**: *No Evidence of Risk In Humans*. Studies in pregnant women have not shown increased risk of fetal abnormalities despite adverse findings in animals or in the absence of adequate human studies


  **C**: *Risk Cannot Be Ruled Out*. Studies are unavailable and animal studies have shown a risk to the fetus or are also lacking. There is a chance of fetal harm if taken during pregnancy but the potential benefits may outweigh the potential harm.


  **D**: *Positive Evidence Of Risk*. Studies in pregnant women have demonstrated a risk to the fetus. However


  **X**: *Contraindicated In Pregnancy*. Studies in animals or pregnant women have demonstrated positive evidence of fetal abnormalities. The use of the product is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant.

* Longtime user of tretinoin .01% gel - my HG product.

* After finding SCA I started the [beginner routine](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/19oiyy/the_starter_skincare_regimen_a_basic_routine_for/).

* I'm also into OCM - if you've posted about OCM

* Oh yeah

Interest in Skincare:

* I am a graduate student which means I have access to academic journals &amp; databases.  I can spend (read: waste) a whole day researching the newest reviews on acne treatments, etc.  This is almost always to the detriment of work I'm supposed to be doing. :)

I got through the stress but my acne remained. I couldn't figure out why it wasn't getting better-I was using my CVS knock-off Neutrogena Wave to scrub with St Ives Apricot Scrub twice a day, I was applying it to my entire face), the spot treating with a SA and a sulfer gel. I started going to the tanning salon thinking it would help dry up my skin, thus eliminating the oil and solving my problems.

Needless to say I was probably singlehandedly causing my own problems. I was so self conscience though I would often cry and refuse to leave my bed if I didn't have to because I was in so much physical and emotional pain caused by my skin. 

Finding this sub has made all the difference in the world. I started with CeraVe foaming cleanser, as my mom drilled it into my head at an early ago how important it was). The CeraVe was irritating my skin so I switched to Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser and kept the other 2 products in my rotation, and I will be shopping for a good sunscreen next time I'm out. Going on about 8 weeks since I started following the routine, and my face doesn't hurt anymore. It doesn't hurt. It's clearing a lot, and the new breakouts are so much less severe than before. I have confidence I haven't had in years.

My mother still looks very young and as I started to have problems with my skin she started to tell me about her beauty routines as a young girl in India. My mother as a young woman had PERFECT skin. She was glowing. So lately we've been going to the Indian store together and rebuilding a little collection. I still want to try more of the remedies they used to use. I'm learning more but these are some of the products I currently have. I had a mini haul today for under 15 dollars. I think I will definitely be learning more from my mother and grandmother about the stuff they did there. Since my mom and my aunts seemed to have amazing skin

I bought the almond oil, neem soap bar, neem powder, neem oil, kalonji oil(black seed oil), and the castor oil. The old products are the amla oil, and the mustard oil.

1364395390.0,1b416l,The Science and History of Apple Cider Vinegar used in Skincare,ieatbugs,54,7,35,"Apple Cider Vinegar is a popular suggestion on this subreddit

ACV might help out with combating acne to help decrease skin's pH back to it's normal 4-6 mark.

It has no anti-inflammatory properties

You can't use Heinz or other cheap brands because it is filtered and pasteurized. It has no health benefits or values such as minerals and vitamins. It is more harsh than raw apple cider vinegar. Most cheap vinegars are synthetic.

Bragg's or Trader Joe's - they both are raw. The cloudy look is important - it is the mother: it contains vitamins and minerals. 
It is important to dilute with distilled water. Equal parts or 25% raw ACV and 75% distilled water. It depends on your skin's tolerance.  (/u/valentinedoux) 


While long used as a folk remedy, apple cider vinegar and apple cider vinegar pills have become a popular dietary supplement.

Most of these claims have no evidence backing them up. Some -- like vinegar's supposed ability to treat lice or warts -- have been studied, but not as well as other treatments. For instance, while vinegar is a disinfectant, it doesn't kill as many germs as common cleaners. And while vinegar does seem to help with jelly fish stings -- an old folk remedy -- hot water works better.

Keep In Mind:

The main ingredient of apple cider vinegar is acetic acid. Apple cider vinegar should always be diluted with water or juice before swallowed. Pure apple cider vinegar could damage the tooth enamel and the tissues in your throat and mouth. One study found a woman who got an apple cider vinegar supplement stuck in her throat suffered lasting damage to her esophagus. In addition

A 2005 study looked at the ingredients of eight different brands of apple cider vinegar supplements. The researchers found that:

The ingredients listed on the box did not reflect the actual ingredients.
The ingredients varied a great deal between different brands.
The recommended dosages varied a great deal between brands.

The rest of the advertisement goes on to claim how great the product is at busting blackheads.

My beef is with the depiction of sebaceous filaments (which are a normal feature of the skin) as blackheads (acne).  So

Some literature regarding sebaceous filaments: [Sebaceous filaments are cylindrical tubes of whitish-yellowish color, corneocyte fragments and one hair. Following the expression of the filament the follicle refills within 30 days. The various portions of sebaceous follicles (acro- and infrainfundibulum) and the follicular contents are presented at the light microscopial and ultrastructural level. Follicles containing sebaceous filaments have a conspicuous granular layer and no acanthosis. Sebaceous filaments should be differentiated from a microcomedo and trichostasis spinolosa. They are a common morphological variant of sebaceous follicles.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/130839)  (G Plewig, HH Wolff, Sebaceous Filaments, Arch. Derm. Res. 255 (1976) 9-21.

Also, wispy hairs, and large sebaceous glands. The terminal fifth of the in-fundibulum, or acroinfundibulum, is lined with normal squamous epithelium. The internal
four fifths, porous mass of horny detritus in the follicular canal, or sebaceous filament, which permits sebum to flow through it. The patency of the infundibulum is not
easily maintained as it lacks rigid terminal hairs that act as wicks for the outward flow of sebum. It is not surprising that most acne lesions occur in sebaceous follicles.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1271924/pdf/westjmed00244-0093.pdf)   (DA Whiting

A harmless but unsightly overgrowth of natural yeast on the skin.,ieatbugs,62,14,17,"Tinea versicolor is a common condition. It is estimated that 2 to 8% of the population of the United States has it. This skin disease commonly affects adolescents and young adults

**The symptoms of this condition include:**

* Generally oval or irregularly-shaped spots of 1⁄4 to 1 inch (0.6 to 2.5 cm) in diameter
* Occasional fine scaling of the skin producing a very superficial ash-like scale
* Pale, with a reddish undertone that can darken when the patient is overheated, such as in a hot shower or during/after exercise. Tanning typically makes the affected areas contrast more starkly with the surrounding skin.
* They may be mildly itchy.
* Sharp border 
* Pityriasis versicolor is more common in hot
* Sometimes severe ""pin-prick"" itching in the affected areas; usually when the person's body temperature is elevated by exercise or a hot/warm environment

These spots commonly affect the back, chest, lower legs, and neck. Occasionally it can also be present on the face. 

More info on symptoms: http://www.aad.org/dermatology-a-to-z/diseases-and-treatments/q---t/tinea-versicolor/signs-symptoms/tinea-versicolor-signs-and-symptoms

**Treatment:**

Recurrence is common and may be reduced by intermittent application of topical anti-fungal agents like tea tree oil

Topical antifungal medications containing 2.5% selenium sulfide (Selsun Extra Strength shampoo) are often recommended. Selsun Blue works for some people, repeated daily for 2 weeks. Ciclopirox (Ciclopirox olamine) is an alternative treatment to ketoconazole as it suppresses growth of the yeast Malassezia furfur. Initial results show similar efficacy to ketoconazole with a relative increase in subjective symptom relief due to its inherent anti-inflammatory properties. Other topical antifungal agents such as clotrimazole, miconazole or terbinafine can lessen symptoms in some patients.

Hope this helps someone!

As we know


Another distinction the authors made was dividing the moisturizers into categories


*Hydrophilic moisturizers* hydrate more rapidly, like in Cerave Cream, so all is likely not lost.) 

*Hydrophobic moisturizers* can hold water both in the upper and lower layers of the SC. These have some occlusive properties, further making it impermeable to water evaporation""---this, to me, is likely due to the lipid content of these sorts of moisturizers.

Anyway, I'm using manuka honey masks, Paula's Choice BH 2%, and CeraVe (I've always used the lotion and/or the AM/PM stuff). I was using Ziana for awhile, but stopped because I sort of want to try to get pregnant soon and I don't want that stuff in my system.

Anyway, frankly, and the fact that it was $15.99 really turned me off (although I imagine it lasts awhile, right?) 

I have a CVS card and I'm signed up to receive emails, there was a 20% coupon that you could actually stack with the email coupon. (In other words, you can use both -- and get 20% twice. Example: $20 purchase. Scanning on 20% coupon brings you total to $16. Scanning the second 20% coupon brings your total to $12.80.)

At CVS

So

* 2 CeraVe cream tubs @ $15.99 each = $31.98
* First 20% off coupon = $25.58
* $5 off of $25 = $20.58
* Second 20% coupon = $16.46

I have thick, rough knees, almost scaly looking feet if I don't moisturize n exfoliate. On top of that, I've got thick coarse body hairs. Even tho I'm a woman, it's never felt feminine. I have to shave daily if I want to be smooth. My hair grows back spiky and I've got hair EVERYWHERE.... So since I was a teenager I've been looking for the solution for ingrown hairs.

Started with infrequent shaving, then scrubbing the fuck out of my skin with brushes, exfo gloves, sugar scrubs, then shaving with oil instead of cream or soap. Tried waxing, tried nair, tried damn near everything but laser. All of these techniques brought some form of relief but none completely prevented ingrown hairs.

For the last few years I've had generally smooth skin and a high-maintenance routine. But still

UNTIL NOW!

I found a soap bar called Crystal Peel that basically mimics microdermabrasion. It's not the cheapest bar of soap on the market but I am in love. Been using it for 2 months and I will never stop using it. I do not recommend this product for thin skinned ppl cuz it's pretty rough. It's exactly what I need. My skin simply does not respond to gentle coaxing.

I scrub my ass n my groin and my legs with this soap bar every day in the shower. I touch my skin after using it n it feels like a different person - so so so soft! I have managed to scrub off those tiny little bumps which were impossibly fine hairs that couldn't burst through my thick dermis. Now

A little bit of background information about me is that my mum is a very experienced beautician (for over 30 years) and has worked for some top salons over her career. She now has her own business and has a lot of regular customers

When I was about 16 I started breaking out and continue to break out even up until now at 20 years old. My skincare regime is to apply a toner/softener then a moisturiser every morning and night. I also cleanse my face once a day. I use primarily Shiseido products but also Thalgo. I don't use sunscreen as often as I should...

Anyway, the product bleaching their towels orange). These days I get pimples around my chin and jaw, sometimes on my cheeks and forehead as well.

I started thinking about when my skin had been the best and when it had been the worst. I realised that my skin issues started at 16

In the last 6 months I have tried to go for a 30 min power walk/run 3 - 4 times a week. I shower straight afterwards. SERIOUSLY, usually at 'that time of the month' I will still get a bit of a break out but my skin is nowhere near as bad as it was before.

I've googled this to see if there's any science behind it and I've found that it might be the sweating that helps. I've also read that excessive exercise can make your skin worse. Whatever it is

I've never learned how to take care of my skin properly and I have A LOT of skin problems and going to a dermatologist is not an option for me right now. I went a year ago and was diagnosed with rosacea on my face and keratosis pilaris and folliculitis on my body. I'm very pale of Irish descent so every flaw shows up on my skin and I have a lot of little spider veins and broken capillaries all over my body too. :( I also have really oily skin (but it sometimes flakes and feels rough and dry?) and pores the size of moon craters and lots of little bumpy clogged pores or oil glands on my forehead. Oh! And lots of what I guess are sebaceous filaments

* What should I use to wash my body with, panoxyl, or zinc soap. What do you guys think? 

* What is the best cream for KP and folliculitis? I've heard a lot about Am-Lactin or U-Lactin

* What should I use to wash my face? My face skin is quite sensitive and reactive so I really like to use natural ingredients. Could oil cleansing work? Or raw honey?

* What should I use to exfoliate my face? Acids sound kind of scary

* Toner? Serum/treatment? Moisturizer? 

* What can make pores smaller or at least cleaner and less inflamed looking? Can chemical peels help?

* What can I use to soothe the redness and inflammation the rosacea creates? I'm going to try to go to my family doctor and get on an anti-biotic or some medication. I have metrogel

* I think my rosacea has already gotten worse. I've blushed easily since I was little, but now I have some broken caps and pustules! :( I'm really paranoid because as rosacea progresses, it gets really awful looking and can deform your nose! Does it always progress like this?

* How can I bring balance to my skin? It's super oily

* Is there anything that can help with spider veins and broken capillaries? 

* Any foods and supplements to take or to avoid?

* Can you rec me a good hand cream and chapstick? They both get so dry.

* Any other tips...

WHen I was in middle school

I was the first one to get a pimple.  No one else, and in a notsogood way.  In 6th grade, my acne first arrived.  It came in groups. Started at 1, made its way to at least 50-60.  I started to skip school, and eventually got called into school to speak to a cop about missing so much.  

This lead to me looking for any skin clearing breakthrough.  I've done peels, steaming, even fucking tapes, and nothing would have an effect, it actually usually made it worse.  With this frusturation came more and more acne.  

I'd grow my hair out, there was a period where I didn't looking into the mirror for 2 years.  Until finally, my sophomore year of highschool, I said fuck it, and used accutane.  

Accutane is a pretty serious prescription.  It comes with a bunch of possible side affects, and using every treatment in the book, I thought this was just going to be another disappointment.  

With this prescription, two pills a day, every day.  I noticed changes almost immediately.  My skin started to dry up, and lips started to bleed, but through and through after a month, My acne was almost 100% gone.  

I kept taking it, but all it takes is having a carmex on hand all dey eery dey.  You're supposed to take the drugs for, if i remember correctly, 5 months.  However, I was a pretty advent athlete, and ended up fracturing my back in lacrosse.  They had to take me off of it, because there was a fear that the drug might have an affect on how my back healed.  

Even after stopping 2 months early, and pads with shit that made your skin burn? gone. 

There is only ONE thing I apply to my face every day

We all have problems, and self-esteem issues that would put a fat kid to shame.  After my face cleared up, I actually started looking in the mirror (which was something that haunted me for years, and it was nice to actually be able to look at your self in the face without wanting to break down :)). 

I was a pretty popular kid when I had acne, and especially no more ""Appalachian mountains"" nickname (probably the harshest because I didn't know about it for years until my friend told me). 

No more pain in my face every morning.  No more looking around my face for new pimples.  No more staying home from school in fear that people will see my new breakouts. And ESPECIALLY no more worrying about the lady friends judging me because of my skin.

I love my life now, which I believe is one of the biggest keys to happiness.  If any of you guys have any questions about how to get through acne problems of your own, or my story please do ask!

1352842135.0,1356nj,Mineral oil and it's benefits for skin. Don't be scared by it!!!,yvva,52,12,40,"So I submitted this earlier but my post got sucked into and eaten by cyberspace. I definitely think there is some debate between a lot of people out there who are scared of mineral oil or try and avoid it because they are under the assumption that it's bad for you.



  Turns out



I came across this review article which I will be summarizing for you guys. I think it laid out the benefits quite well, K. J. (2012), A review on the extensive skin benefits of mineral oil. International Journal of Cosmetic Science, 34: 511–518. )






The difference between regular mineral oil and baby oil is that baby oil has a fragrance added to it. If you're sensitive to fragrances I don't suggest baby oil. 


It can be used to treat mild eczema when corticosteroids are not desirable and also to clean ears ( 2-3 drops).  



Although mineral oil's main benefit is to sit on top of skin ( as occlusives do to prevent water loss). This is due to its composition of straight alkyl chains---they form a barrier to help prevent anything from going in or coming out.  it's occlusivity is not 100% perfect though because the chains are not all the same length



Also due to these chains is why it does not penetrate the skin--the molecular structure is just too large.  However


It is



It is highly emollient----making the skin feel soft. 



It has a moderate about of substantivity----amount in which a chemical stays on skin. This means it remains on the skin through friction, you want your sunscreen to have high substantivity) 



So what does this mean for your skin? Basically mineral oil can increase the thickness of the stratum corneum ( outer layer of skin)



Mineral oil is a good alternative to vaseline/aquaphor if you really hate the thick/waxy texture.  Mineral oil


Re-iterating the issue of comedogenicity ( pore clogging)---Basically back in the 70's it was thought that mineral oil clogged pores because of some rabbit studies. However, it is important to keep in mind that there ARE exceptions to all things. There will inevitably be people who are allergic to ""hypo-allergenic"" things, there will be people who happen to be sensitive to "" non-comedogenic"" things.  Genetic variation is just a fact.   Anyways here's the cool paragraph!   

""‘Acne cosmetica’ was coined in the early 1970s to describe the association between cosmetic use and acne breakouts. A variety of oils, in which mineral oil was reported not to be comedogenic. The American Academy of Dermatology proposed guidelines to try to interpret the differences in the animal to human data, and they concluded that 1–2 comedones in animal testing would be unlikely to be an indicator of comedogenicity in humans [38]. This is precisely the comedogenic activity of 100% mineral oil reported in five studies, that is, zero. Furthermore, DiNardo tested in humans the formulations containing mineral oil up to 30% and found that there was no comedogenicity potential of mineral oil [39]. A wide series of products were tested that showed a comedogenic activity in the same range as the negative control. The overall conclusion is that mineral oil is **not comedogenic**. But this article also reveals that there is a difference between animal models and human models: the rabbit model is much more prone to comedogenicity than the human model, but all the earlier data that condemned mineral oil originate from animal models



For those concerned about photosensitivity



Overall  ""Mineral oil is an efficacious skin moisturizer providing occlusivity and emolliency. Its occlusive effects lead to increases in stratum corneum water content by reducing transepidermal water loss. Through this mechanism, and as a result of its limited penetration, it is considered to be a very safe ingredient for cosmetic use.""  




Hope everyone found this interesting.  I didn't know much about mineral oil before reading this. I just thought baby oil smelled nice and make my skin soft





**EDIT**: I'm seeing the downvotes and not totally sure why?   I'm trying to spread what I learned today because knowledge will help you make better choices. So I want to re-iterate that I summarized the article here


**EDIT 2**: Just wanted to make sure if you're going to use baby oil on your face and you have sensitive skin

* Three or four pumps of DIY sea kelp bioferment treatment (think of [La Mer The Concentrate](http://www.cremedelamer.com/product/6719/12421/The-Concentrate/The-Concentrate) but my own version.) and 4 or 5 drops of my AM oil blend: jojoba+watermelon seed+hazelnut oil or other oils - depends on how my skin looks. Mix together then apply it on my face and neck. I also pat it gently on my eyes.

[Original Post Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/15v5jk/help_cystic_acne_flakiness_and_sensitive_skin_can/)

You guys gave me a lot of really good advice so I thought I'd come back with an update... My skin looks AWESOME. For the first time in a year I have no pimples. Not one. After my post I took the advice I got here and ditched the salicylic acid pads and the scrub and I upped my retin-a usage from about once or twice a week to every three days (just started doing every other day this week). I also ended up ditching the clindamycin after getting chronic yeast infections (GROSS) that began a couple of days after I started using it - my doctor says it's unlikely that a topical antibiotic could be causing them but I haven't gotten one since stopping a couple of weeks ago (thank god). 

Currently my routine is: 

Mornings: Wash with Cerave Hydrating Cleanser

Evenings: Take off makeup with Aveeno makeup removing wipes. Wash with Cerave Hydrating Cleanser. Retin-a or 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. Wait at least 20 min if using retin-a and then Cerave in the tub and vaseline. 

Looking at my old post I also switched my moisturizer from a heavy La Roche Posay one to Cerave - my skin doesn't need that heavy of a moisturizer anymore. I still have some hyperpigmentation but it's going away and the overall quality of my skin is so much better than even before I started breaking out. 

I ran into a guy on Saturday who I had been casually dating in November/December who only really knew me when my acne was at it's worst. I hadn't seen him since Christmas and the first thing he said to me was

**Safety first**

We are a skincare subreddit. This means that a lot of what we talk about includes products and remedies that people will try out at home. We want to make sure that people take the **right** advice from us and aren't persuaded towards a harmful one. Manufacturers of skincare products have to do lots of testing on what they sell to make sure that it is safe for humans to use. When someone puts forth a non-traditional remedy

This brings me to my next point: Natural does not mean ""healthy"", and introducing us to remedies that will help us. But if they are things that haven't got a seal of approval from an authority on them, we do expect some evidence that they are:

- Detox diets. Many people throw this idea around that detoxing is good for your body. However, vegetables, meats, everything. Simply cutting out meat and eating bananas doesn't mean your body will be ""toxin free"". In fact, in most cases these diets cause people to be more prone to fatigue and unable to concentrate well. It can result in an unhealthy lifestyle (even though that's the opposite of what you intended!) and also be dangerous. In cases like this, if you do want to do a new type of fast, you should always consult a doctor or specialist first. Starting a diet because you read about it in the internet is a very

  So since i turned 13 years old i've been fighting acne, to say the least. Last year (age 25), after trying practically every single acne solution on the planet, including the best/most expensive prescriptions my dermatologist could muster, I decided to stop treating the symptoms, but actually start treating the cause.


  After a whole lot of research, it is no longer uncontrollably greasy. I will say though, that to see results took about 4 weeks, but if you decide to do this, keep with it, be diligent about it, and I believe you'll see the same results i did.


Here is my routine:

I wash my face in the morning and at night. Easy right? It is. But don't bother with any of that fancy junk... here is the real Holy Grail:


   **Step ONE: Jojoba Oil (100% organic &amp; cold pressed!):**

Yep. Oil removes oil, breathe, enjoy. If you're wearing makeup, after massaging for a minute, take a cotton pad, wet it, and use it to remove your makeup, but please USE SPARINGLY. 


   **Step TWO: Dr Bronner's Liquid Soap:** 

I use the tea tree kind because i love the smell, it works just as well. Use enough soap to lather in your hands. Massage on your face for 30 seconds. Rinse. Then wash your face again with the soap for another 30 seconds. 


   **Step THREE:** 

Dry your face! Yay! Please use a clean towel.


   **Step FOUR: Dickinson's Witch Hazel Toner.** 

This stuff is CHEAP and works wonders. I can't even say enough good things about it. It doesn't smell great


   **Step FIVE: Jojoba Oil again.**

No need for moisturizer (unless your skin is begging for it, not removing oil. Don't forget under your eyes! If you use too much, no problem, just wipe it off a bit with a clean towel!


Okay


Now onto my vitamin regimen... 


   **Pantothenic Acid (B5) by TWINLAB:** 

This helps reduce your skin's sebum production while simultaneously reducing pore size and clearing up existing acne. I started at 10 500mg pills daily... 5 in the morning and 5 at night


   **Cod Liver Oil Pills by Carlson:**

This is an all-over-health vitamin. It does everything. Clears your skin, fights PMS, fights depression...everything. And everything it does, it does it WELL.
I take one 1000mg pill in the morning and one at night. It's important to space out your vitamin dosages because your body will be better able to absorb the nutrients. Yes


   **Zinc:**

This is a little known acne fighter. Many people don't get enough zinc in their diet and the effect of that tends to show up on your skin in the form of cystic acne. I take one 50mg pill in the morning and one at night.


   **Folic Acid by TWINLAB:** 

It is most famously known as a prenatal vitamin that is also excellent for hair and nails. Not many people know that it also makes your skin glow healthy and have a youthful appearance. This stuff is fantastic. I take one 800mcg tablet in the morning and one at night.


   **Evening Primrose Oil:** 

This is another one of those cure-all vitamins that not enough people use. It has a fair number of benefits, and also aids in fighting menstrual pain. I take 500-1300mg (depending on the bottle i buy) in the morning and the same amount at night.


If you are diligent about this...wash your face in the morning, even after you start seeing results, i can almost guarantee you that you will finally have the skin you have always wanted. I definitely do. 


Feel free to ask any more questions if you have them!! I want to help everyone be as happy with their skin as i am!

Is there anything I can do on my own to reduce acne? — Yes. The way you take care of your skin has a big effect on your acne. Here’s what you should do:


Wash your face no more than twice a day. Use warm — not hot — water, because that can worsen acne and damage the skin.


Do not pick or squeeze pimples. This can worsen acne and damage the skin. Plus it can lead to infections.


Use a moisturizer. Moisturizers labeled as “non-comedogenic” and without scents or dyes are often best.
Avoid oil-based make-up and skin products. They can worsen acne.


Can I treat my own acne? — If you have mild acne, ask your doctor or nurse for advice.


How is acne treated? — Doctors can treat acne using different types of medicines. Sometimes doctors suggest trying more than one medicine at once.


There is no one medicine or combination of medicines that works best for everyone. Instead


Many of the medicines that doctors prescribe to treat acne also come in non-prescription strength. The prescription products include:


Retinoids — Retinoids are medicines that help keep your pores unclogged. Most retinoids are available in a gel or cream that you put on your skin. Examples include tretinoin (sold as Retin-A®)


Products that help skin shed – Products such salicylic acid


Antibiotics you put on the skin – Antibiotics reduce acne by killing the bacteria inside pimples. They also help bring down inflammation. These medicines include erythromycin


Benzoyl peroxide – Benzoyl peroxide kills bacteria and helps to unclog pores.


Antibiotics you take in a pill – Antibiotic pills work for the same reasons antibiotic gels or lotions work. But they tend to be stronger and can cause unpleasant side effects.


Birth control pills – Some of the skin reactions that lead to acne are controlled by hormones. For this reason


Isotretinoin pills (sold as Amnesteem™, called isotretinoin, is very effective against severe acne. But it can also cause serious side effects and birth defects. Women who want to take isotretinoin must follow very strict safety rules to avoid pregnancy. (This medicine used to be sold as Accutane®, but that brand name is no longer available in the US.)


What if I want to get pregnant? — If you want to get pregnant


Will my diet affect my acne? — Studies have not found a strong link between diet and acne.

1351531826.0,12a9s2,"The quick and dirty on sunscreen ingredients, sun protection, and antioxidant care",fairbianca,44,23, antioxidant care, and which I will be explaining further as we go).

**Physical vs. chemical sunscreens**
First essential aspect to understanding sunscreen ingredients is in knowing the difference between physical and chemical sunscreens, which can affect the way the skin feels, and can sometimes be heavy under makeup, particularly in popular formulations.  Physical sunscreens (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) generally have an excellent range of UVA blocking properties, although the amount of each needed to protect against UV rays can sometimes lead to cosmetic inelegance, and the full UVA spectrum is not covered completely by either.  This was ameliorated in part by the use of Z-Cote zinc oxide, which is literally micronized and coated with silicon in order to facilitate its cosmetic elegance and efficacy both.  There has also been controversy about Z-Cote zinc oxide for many of the same reasons outlined in ieatbugs' discussion on oxybenzone - people are afraid that Z-Cote is in fact so small that it may actually absorb into the skin.  Frankly (and this is my opinion here, actually.  I wouldn't let fear of Z-Cote interfere with this.

Chemical sunscreens are literally that - chemicals added to sunscreen formulations in order to absorb and neutralize UV rays rather than reflecting them, such as the common feeling of having a ""film"" on skin (thankfully rare with a good formulation) or strange results when being photographed.  Following is an excerpt from the article linked by ieatbugs on the difference between physical and chemical (or inorganic and organic) sunscreens:

&gt;To make matters more confusing, this does not refer to whether or not you’ll find them at your local natural grocery store. Instead, it refers to whether or not it contains a carbon atom. So if any chemical compound includes carbon atoms, it is referred to as ‘organic.’ Organic filters include the chemical sunscreens found in many formulations. Inorganic filters are more commonly referred to as physical or mineral sunscreens. These include the physical compounds zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. These physical sunscreens sit on the skin and scatter or reflect UV rays. On the other hand, chemical sunscreens typically absorb the UV rays. These include ingredients such as avobenzone, oxybenzone and homosalate, among others.  http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/128ino/shedding_light_on_sun_safety_oxybenzone_does_not/

**Sunscreen facts everyone should know**
Here's some things to keep in mind now that you have a grasp on chemical vs. physical sunscreens:  the manner in which you apply them, all have an effect on whether or not you are actually getting sunscreen protection.  

* If you use a chemical sunscreen

* If you combine certain chemical sunscreens (most notably avobenzone and octinoxate) you will not be protected as they actually destabilize one another - and they are both very common ingredients both in sunscreens and in makeup and skin care products.  

* If you combine zinc oxide and octinoxate

* Avobenzone will stain your clothes yellow if you get it on the fabric.  

* Avobenzone will also destabilize on its own without further ingredient support - the only stabilized formulations including avobenzone I know about in the United States are in Neutrogena products.

* If you don't apply enough sunscreen, if you apply half the necessary amount of SPF50 you need, you do not get 25 - you get around 6 or 7.

* Having sunscreen in your foundation - or in your mineral makeup powder or sunscreen - is NOT sufficient.  In order to fully protect your face, it would look more than a little odd on the rest of us.

**SPF vs PPD**
Most people have heard of SPF, PA++, or PA+++.  A decent PPD factor covers PA+++, and has a score of at least 8 on the BASF sunscreen simulator (link included below).  Most people believe that UVA protection is covered by SPF, but it isn't, unfortunately.  SPF does not account for those, and a high SPF is not a guarantee that you are being protected from UVA rays.  This is particularly cruel, and what most people think they are being protected from when they buy a sunscreen with a high SPF.  There are only three FDA-approved UVA sunscreens in the United States:  avobenzone, are available overseas.  La Roche Posay is a company that produces sunscreens famous for having a high PPD factor that will in fact protect against UVA ray exposure.  It also has a reputation for being a bit greasier, these sunscreens are a great way to go if you are serious about preventing accelerated skin aging.  What tends to be true is that European formulations tend to be very on point with PPD protection while less cosmetically elegant

**Okay so which one?**
There isn't a right answer to this question, or neutralize all those UV uglies coming to zap your collagen.  The best way to do this is to find one that you will wear, every day, in the proper amounts, without fail.  If you are often outside, or you sweat a lot, or are otherwise active, as they are the most elegant versions I have found that are also water resistant (although these will often require you to double-cleanse at night with an oil cleanser - Shiseido does have a nice one).  If you are not often outside, and the one I wear daily, and stick with it.

**Further ways to maximize sun protection**
Antioxidants are going to be extremely helpful in fighting off and repairing sun damage both.  There are several ways to go about this:  one of the easiest is to use a (stabilized!) Vitamin C product underneath sunscreen every day as part of your regular skin care regimen.  Vitamin C will not only stave off sun damage, no matter what claims are made by hopeful skincare manufacturers, a retinoid is the ONLY ingredient FDA approved (and proven) to stimulate collagen, and hence, is the only truly proven ingredient that will work in this manner.  It is a double-edged sword in the sense that it does make your skin at once more sensitive to and more resistant to UV damage.  Also, it can be extremely irritating if not applied properly and scaffolded into skin care.  However, the benefits are quite worth it for those who are able to use, but when used regularly it can certainly bolster up your protection

Best of luck to all of you in your search for sunscreens and antioxidant care - I'll do the best I can to answer any questions you may have should you have any

1350948653.0,11wrxp,"My Story: A battle with seborrhea and possible solution to acne, rosacea, dry, itchy skin, eczema, etc on the face.",39

I'm writing today because I see so many articles looking for help with a variety of skin problems. I hope this will help some of you who have **acne, eczema-like conditions, rosacea, dermatitis, brandy nose etc**. Since it was an article posted here that helped me so much, I wanted to share my experience with you.

Let's start with some information about me. I'm currently 27 years old, no allergies. I eat well, and try to take care of my skin, though not so rigorously as some of you. Overall, I'm healthy. I haven't gone to a general doctor in... well I don't know. I'm not much of a natural remedy person; I'd go for the prescription medicine over the vitamin/herbal route any day.

It was roughly three years ago that I started to notice dry skin on my face. It began on my cheeks to either side of my nostrils. At first

The most affected area of my face was in the creases next to my nostrils, petroleum jelly, cleaning with an astringent, steroid creams, etc. Some things helped temporarily but never for long. I noticed some other peculiarities: symptoms were milder when I changed my pillowcase often, intensity would come in cycles - good for a week or so then a breakout, some treatments would help for a while then I'd have a breakout, but my case looked a lot like the example here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seborrhoeic_dermatitis.jpg

After several months and worsening conditions, and extremely itchy (think poison ivy). I tried to moisturize and not to scratch. Everyone noticed the problem, and I was going out of my mind. I finally made an appointment with a dermatologist for the following week. That evening or the next day I tried using a dandruff shampoo on my face. After a few minutes dead skin rinsed off like I was molting. That week the condition was the best it had been in months, though not completely gone.

At my dermatologist appointment, I found out that the causes of seborrhea are not very well understood. Various sources listed diet, bacteria, fungus, immune problems and genetics as things that caused or resulted in an excess of sebum causing seborrhea. Most resources agreed that it is a chronic problem that only seems to go away when your body decides it's time. This was somewhat disheartening, but I figured I'd see how well the prescription worked.

The sulfacetamide did well to control my seborrhea. I never had another bad breakout. It stunted the flakiness and moisturized my skin enough that after my morning regimen no one noticed the condition on my face. For three years I was content with the results and I came to terms with the fact that I'd be using a prescription cream in the long term.

In May of this year, it did not last. A week or two after I got home the seborrhea came back and my hopes were dashed.

In the following months my face got progressively (but very slowly) worse. Or maybe it was just that I had gotten a glimmer of hope and then was dissatisfied with my current results. Maybe it was actually that the prescription was expired. Maybe it was that I started wearing glasses and the nosepieces were in constant contact with my skin. In any case

Same deal. Seborrhea/rosacea. How's it working? You satisfied? Yeah, this turned out to be very good news. I spent the entire afternoon at work researching demodex. I read reference works, results of studies, first person accounts. The more I read, the more I was convinced this was the problem. Everything started to add up. Breakouts that seemed to come in cycles, symptoms affected by how often I changed my bedding, clearing up while on vacation; these were things I noticed. Sources also described symptoms I hadn't noticed like enlarged pores. I explained about me at the beginning of this write-up so that you'd know I'm not a hypochondriac. But I was confident that was I had experienced for three years was finally explained.

I found this website: [demodexsolutions.com](http://www.demodexsolutions.com/). Perhaps like me, I decided it's trustworthy enough.

I went home and performed the test as they suggested. I had a microscope in the basement and took a sample of sebum from 8-10 of my pores. I found 4 demodex mites

It took about two weeks for my package to come

**I am not affiliated with www.demodexsolutions.com**

That site claims **""Adolescent acne is for 90% caused by Human Demodex mites, acne rosacea, some other kinds of rosacea, brandy nose, widened large pores, itching face and scalp, itching eyelashes and eyebrows plus other demodex related skin problems.""** I only had seborrhea and rosacea, that would be 45% of acne sufferers that could easily be treated. **Breakouts that come in cycles and changes in routine that cause breakouts are a good indicator of demodex.**

I don't know why western doctors don't admit that demodex can be a problem. I've read that they are taught that demodex are naturally occurring and cause no skin problems. But more and more studies are suggesting that this is false. In my case

When I post here

I'm not sure if this will help anyone

**TL;DR: Demodex mites live and die in your skin and cause all sorts of skin conditions like acne and dermatitis. www.demodexsolutions.com is a site that explains about demodex in depth and sells treatment to kill them.**

Edit (10/27/12): I thought it best to respond to a spammed comment below that is misinformed regarding Noble Zinc. Noble Zinc soap contains the compound pyrithione zinc with chemical formula C10H8N2O2S2Zn. This is not the same as zinc oxide (ZnO) which is one ingredient in the recommended treatment linked in this post. Treatments for pityrosporum yeast did not help me.

**What is Rosacea?** Rosacea is a chronic and potentially life-disruptive disorder primarily of the facial skin, chin or forehead that may come and go. In some cases, rosacea may also occur on the neck, chest, scalp or ears. Over time, the redness tends to become ruddier and more persistent, and visible blood vessels may appear. Left untreated, and in severe cases the nose may grow swollen and bumpy from excess tissue. This is the condition, feeling irritated and appearing watery or bloodshot.

Approximately 1 in every 20 Americans - 14 million people - are estimated to be affected with rosacea. As it is frequently misdiagnosed the incidence may be a lot higher. A Gallup survey revealed that 78% of Americans do not know anything about rosacea

**What does Rosacea look like?** Flushing, cysts and pimples, visible blood vessels, broken capillaries, skin thickening, scaly and dry appearance, plaques (raised red patches) and/or swelling. Images: [Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea](http://suggestlinkdirectory.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/rosacea.jpg) (mild or severe), [Rosacea Fulminans](http://www.onlinedermclinic.com/dz_images/1/3/13579793324e862172b5ba0.jpg) (large nodules) and [Phymatous Rosacea](http://derm101.com/LoadMedia.ashx?name=Rosacea&amp;filename=rosacea001g006d.jpg) (more commonly in males than females). [The Stages of Rosacea slideshow from mild to severe](http://health-tools.health.msn.com/rosacea/the-stages-of-rosacea-slideshow).

**What causes Rosacea?** The cause of rosacea is unknown, caffeine, alcohol, temperature extremes, sunlight, stress and anger, strenuous exercise, corticosteroids

Rosacea is more common among fair-skinned people of northern European ancestry. However, South Asia, and China is growing, especially in regions that have undergone socioeconomic development in recent years. This has triggered speculation that lifestyle may be a risk factor, and not just skin color. Others say incidence has grown in those areas because healthcare and diagnosis techniques have improved.

**How is Rosacea treated?** The signs and symptoms of rosacea vary from one patient to another

Treatment for the skin includes:

* Medicine that is applied to the rosacea
* Sunscreen (Wearing it every day can help prevent flare-ups; physical blockers are highly recommended)
* An emollient to help repair the skin
* Lasers and other light treatments
* Antibiotics

Patients should check with their physicians to ensure their skin-care routine is compatible with their rosacea. A gentle skin-care routine can also help control rosacea. Patients are advised to clean their face with a mild and non-abrasive cleanser

Patients may apply non-irritating skin-care products as needed

In addition to medical treatment

**What is the outcome of Rosacea?** There is no cure for rosacea. People often have rosacea for years.  

In one study

Some people have rosacea flare-ups for life. Treatment can prevent the rosacea from getting worse. Treatment also can reduce the acne-like breakouts

So. Overhaul. I started 6 months ago with a tube of RetinA (OTC for $6 here) and some Lisa Eldridge recommended cleansers, I want it all and have amassed a whole bunch of new stuff because I'm all over the place without a real plan.

- AM: Hand wash (ditched the Clairsonic) with Mario Badescu Enzyme Gel (it's a large sample so I need to find something permanent). Apply Josie Maran SPF 40 (but I think it's giving me little blemishes). Makeup.

- PM: No-water cleanse with Avene Extra Gentle Cleansing lotion. Apply RetinA 0.05

I've also ordered ANR and it should be here in a few days

The upside is that I've lessened the cystic breakouts and the fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth have really disappeared. But after lurking here

- I have flakes on my T-zone and corners of my mouth that are disturbing my foundation

- I have acne scars

- Am I supposed to be adding a moisturizer on top of the ANR? I haven't even settled on a new one yet - I have a tub of CeraVe on it's way to me so I'll be trying that next week.

The locals thought that I wasn't aware of this and would tell me that I was ""MUY BLANCA"" at least once a day. [Gratuitous bikini shot/reference pic](http://i.imgur.com/SE7eqFD.jpg) I'm sorry that the instagram filter actually makes it look like my skin has some color

Sounds like a recipe for disaster doesn't it? No one could possibly spend a week in that kind of UV intensity and not burn right?

**WRONG**

I came back with only a few more freckles on my arms than when I left and not even a tint of pink. In my ref. pic. I had been in Mexico laying on the beach for 5 days straight by then. And nary a lick of burn to be seen.

I know that some of you think that there is no amount of sunscreen that will protect you form burning. I am here to tell you that you're just not using enough. And to give you my fail proof

**Step 1.** As soon as you get up, gentle, high SPF, high PPD, cheap. Perfect. SLATHER! Thick, white. I would drizzle the sunscreen like delicious white sauce all over my body and then rub it in. 

Ok

**Step 2.** When you get to the beach

**Step 3.** Ok so you've been swimming and having fun for an hour or you've been walking around exploring for a few hours. Guess what time it is? YES! TIME FOR MORE SUNSCREEN! Apply another layer and let it soak in. 

Repeat step 3 as needed. For me I probably used 5 coats of sunscreen on a beach day. A full bottle

Other tips:

* Wide brim hat while you're out walking around. Nothing beats shade for sun protection. 

* UPF clothing. When I was at the beach

* Stay the fuck out of Cabo San Lucas. That place is a shit hole. 

Single downside: all of that wonderful water resistant zinc oxide? Well

1364572209.0,1b8wg5,Vitamin E and scar reduction: Some literature behind its (in)efficacy,yvva,38,7,22,"**TL;DR;  There's actually no evidence indicating that Vitamin E alone improves the appearance of scarring and some evidence even suggests it may worsen the appearance.  There is some evidence (as noted below) that a silicone scar sheet plus Vit E could be beneficial




I was chatting with /u/ieatbugs and she thought I should make this a post of its own


No OTC topical currently exists to decrease the raised appearance of scars and the evidence is lacking about other topical treatments in reducing the appearance of scars in general. 

For this post, though I intend to create another thread on those sometime in the near future.


The general ( or mostly so) consensus as of now, moisturize those fresh scars!!!


[This](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17312518) provides one review of various scar treatment options.  This is the paragraph re: Vit E:


&gt; Vitamin E is the major lipid-soluble antioxidant in the skin and is believed by some to decrease scar formation due to its ability to inhibit fibroblasts and keratocytes in humans and rabbits in vitro.29, evidence does exist that it causes harm. Vitamin E may be beneficial when combined with silicone gel sheets, though. A review by Parsa in 1988 highlighted the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin E in animal models but noted that controlled clinical trials in humans demonstrated no improved scar healing and a high incidence of minor adverse reactions.31 A double-blinded, controlled study illustrated that treatment of scars with topical vitamin E did not help in scar reduction but was associated with an increased incidence of contact dermatitis.32 Another double-blinded, controlled study conducted on patients after operative procedures for postburn contractures revealed that treatment with vitamin E provided no benefit in range of motion, scar thickness, change in graft size, one Italian simple-blinded clinical trial published in 1995 illustrated that more patients had significant improvement in the pain, and induration of their hypertrophic and keloid scars when they received silicone gel sheets with added vitamin E compared with patients who received silicone gel sheets alone for 4 (85 percent versus 55 percent) and 8 weeks (95 percent versus 75 percent).34




[This](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17097399) is another article reviewing various topicals. This is their section on Vit E and hypertrophic scarring:



&gt; Vitamin E (tocopherol), cellular membranes, and lipids. Vitamin E also alters collagen and glycosaminoglycan production and inhibits the spread of peroxidation of lipids in cellular membranes, thereby acting as a membrane-stabilizing agent.51 and 52

&gt; Despite numerous anecdotal reports claiming that vitamin E speeds wound healing and improves the cosmetic appearance of scars, used topical vitamin E in the postoperative period. No significant differences were found in range of motion, scar thickness, change in graft size, and overall cosmetic appearance between the vitamin E treatment group and base cream control group 1 year after surgery. In addition, 20% of patients reported local reactions to the vitamin E cream. A subsequent double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating patients who applied emollient with vitamin E and emollient alone to each half of their scar from Mohs micrographic surgery (twice daily for 4 weeks starting soon after surgery) also demonstrated similar results. Twelve weeks after surgery, which has been widely associated with contact dermatitis

&gt; The use of vitamin E in scar management has other theoretic limitations. Because of its ability to inhibit collagen synthesis, lead to the development of widened scars and even wound dehiscence.55

&gt; When used in conjunction with silicone gel sheets, 38 patients (95%) who received silicone gel sheets with added vitamin E improved by at least 50% with respect to color, size, and cosmetic appearance, whereas only 30 patients (75%) using silicone gel sheets alone improved at least 50% after 2 months of treatment.56 This study led to the conclusion that the combination of vitamin E and silicone gel sheeting is beneficial in hypertrophic scar treatment, possibly as a result of a synergistic effect.

&gt; In conclusion, be discouraged.

3. I circled my symptoms and how they impact me.
4. I then wrote down a list of all my other diagnoses *(which can all fall under an auto-immune disease).*
5. I went in armed with my family history.

1370986407.0,1g5g5a,Low-pH Solubility/Ionization of Zinc Oxide in Sunscreen,gyroscopic,35,3,15,"After the recent discussion in the “skincare no-no” thread

First, zinc ions are actually good for you, and zinc is a great antioxidant on its own:

&gt;Topical zinc, such as iron and copper, at critical sites in cell membranes and proteins; alternatively, zinc ions may induce the synthesis of metallothionein, sulfhydryl-rich proteins that protect against free radicals. No matter how they work, topical zinc ions may provide an important and helpful antioxidant defense for skin. ([Source]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12358835))

&gt;Zinc ion facilitates biochemical reactions that mediate the **growth and remodeling of tissue.** […] Zinc is a ubiquitous micronutrient whose activity is so crucial to bodily function that it has been called a master hormone… Zinc ion (Zn2+) forms ligands, and oxygen from glutamate, aspartate, and water. Zn2 does not readily oxidize or reduce, and easily undergoes ligand exchange reactions. […] **Another function of zinc not commonly appreciated is its antioxidant activity.** Two known mechanisms for this activity are zinc’s ability to protect sulfhydryl groups and **inhibit the metal ion-induced formation of reactive oxygen species, which are chronically toxic. The antioxidant effects of zinc have been observed in many experimental systems, including human skin fibroblasts that were stressed with either hydrogen peroxide, or ultraviolet-B light.** Zinc also **decreased the cytotoxicity of these stressors to skin cells**

Both of these studies emphasize the benefits of zinc *ions*, and ionized zinc will be too small to perform this task. While zinc ions are a good antioxidant, it’s best to keep our SPF at full strength. Do remember that zinc ions *are not harmful* and you shouldn’t be overly worried about a bit of ionization provided your SPF is still doing its job.

So, and your skin’s pH is probably around 4.5-5.5. Warning, conjecture ahead: since baby skin is slightly more alkaline, it makes sense that zinc is commonly recommended as a baby sunscreen and is probably quite stable on their skin. Anyway, if zinc oxide couldn’t withstand normal skin’s 4.5-5.5 pH environment it would be worthless as an SPF and never would have gained a reputation as a stable and effective sunscreen in the first place. Let’s look at the [zinc ion’s prevalence across a range of pH values]( http://george-eby-research.com/gif/hand1_f1.gif) in a handy chart someone else made and I cannot take credit for. We’re looking at the Zn2+ ion here, which you’ll notice takes a big swing upward around pH 3.5 and lower, but is relatively consistent in the 3.5-6.5 range. Unless your skin is around 3.5 or lower at the moment in which you apply the zinc oxide SPF, neutralized skin’s pH.

Now

Vitamin C serums are generally most effective below 3.5, the serum + zinc oxide interaction is an effect of the *pH*, not the *vitamin C.* The vitamin C is simply the vehicle through which the low pH is caused, and the ingredient itself isn't important.

Chemical exfoliators are really only effective under 4.0

What are you noticing here? The vitamin C serum and the BHA, your skin is quite likely to be around 4.0 at least by the time you’re applying your SPF. Read more great info about skin and product pH and wait times [here]( http://www.essentialdayspa.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=18360).

So

1) Zinc ions are not bad for you and in fact have some nice benefits!

2) The pH of your skin needs to be under 3.5 at the time of SPF application to ionize a substantial amount of zinc oxide.

3) Most low pH products are still quite close to the ionization plateau pH range.

4) If you apply moisturizer and/or leave a few minutes of waiting time

5) Most sunscreens do not rely on zinc oxide alone for SPF and the other ingredients don’t appear to be affected by pH.

6) Antioxidants are good to use during the day and help mop up some of the inevitable UV damage that will occur even with SPF. Keep using them!

Some additional info from Gingerrama on MUA

* Some of their raw data is useful; but it's unreliable--I always double-check ingredient lists posted there

* Information is frequently misread

* Gross misuse and abuse of the terms ""toxic"" and ""chemical.""

* Rhetorical bullying of readers to instil trust. Worse: not trust through facts + persuasion

* All the above leading to fear-mongering

* Prejudice: nationalist (weak coverage of non-American brands). Against big business--and big labs. For small business: which may be ethically and politically laudable but that's irrelevant to product performance and safety).

I've been using Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant and Shiseido white lucent cleansing foam for about a year now with no problems. I tried uzing Aztec Healing Clay (3 applications) which made my bumps a bit more red.  I know the container says that the first couple uses will make it worse before it gets better

Has anyone else had this problem?  I haven't been applying anything new to my face to trigger this.  The only possible thing is I used to drink TONS more water and sweat a lot from hitting the gym.  I haven't been to the gym in a while and my water intake is now moderate.  Oh

I am 23

About my skin:

-My skin is very oily. I've tried using oil-free lotion and it helps sometimes

-I have blemishes and scars on both cheeks and my forehead, but they are still red and depending on my condition will inflame. Worst than this, sometimes (on the scars near my eyebrows on my forehead) there will be a few red bumps that appear, they don't seem to be pimples exactly. 

So my questions:

I want to start a regimen to stick to. Since I am a guy


And I will probably find this out soon enough, the red spots, the little random zit-like bumps that I get, the discolored acne spot from two semesters ago? Eventually I'd like to (probably through laser treatment), take care of my deep pitted scars, and the scars on my cheeks.

My Mom was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer last year and had to undergo a bilateral total mastectomy w/ underarm lymph node removal followed by fairly aggressive chemotherapy. Since then she seems to be in the clear (yay!) but she has developed fairly pronounced bags under her eyes and a redness to her upper cheeks that she is unhappy about. Overall

Since it's almost Mother's Day here in the US I wanted to surprise her with a ""Skin Care"" basket and was wondering what you guys would suggest to put in it to help her with her ""problem"" areas. Her skin is normal to dry and very very sensitive now as a result from the chemo.

Here is a picture of her with one of her wigs from when she was still in treatment: [Click for picture!](http://i.imgur.com/RtPonaa.jpg)

1. Cleanser: Not too sure about this. I want to give her something luxurious. Was thinking the [Boscia Soothing Cleansing Cream](http://www.sephora.com/soothing-cleansing-cream-P61203?skuId=1227875) would be nice.

1. Night Time Moisturizer: I'm stuck! Thinking straight [Argan Oil from GoW](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/3777591.htm). 

1. Eye-cream for the puffiness: NO IDEA! 

My Mom is a former hippie so a huge skincare routine is going to be a big turn-off for her. The best I can do is a cleanser/AHA pads/moisturizer/eye cream. **I really want to concentrate on the eye cream as the bags under her eyes are what make her the most self-conscious so suggestion for that would be the most helpful**. The redness I can handle as it's a by-product of the chemo and I have rosacea so I think I'm going to plop my secret weapon of Korean BB Cream in her package ;)

1366335036.0,1cndus,[UPDATE] I had my laser hair removal consultations and asked lots of skin questions!,spunky-omelette,32,4,8,"I promised an update

I went to two places for consultations today.  Both places used CynoSure lasers

The first place was owned and run by one woman who was a technician with 20+ years experience.  The second place had a team of estheticians and the owner a 40-year practicing doctor.

Lots of points people brought up here were so helpful!  One thing in particular I was concerned about was hyperpigmentation--with the summer up ahead, and when I do I slather on zinc oxide sunscreen.  Both clinics told me that so long as I am very diligent about sunscreen (the second clinic said physical blockers are the way to go), I should not have any problems with sun and the treatment.

I was also told by both clinics that since my PCOS is under control (I am actively treating it with the pill and it's actually in *awesome* shape now that my diet and exercise routine are in order), forever).  

Also, such as prep (shaving before treatment and gently exfoliating a while afterwards, etc) were all brought up.  I felt so prepared!  Even the scar I have on my arm was acknowledged, and I was told that the lasers should have no effect on it.

The first clinic quoted me a lower price for full arms (she initially told me $200/session on the phone, just that they're ""discounted.""  The second clinic had a full breakdown of all the prices ($225/session or $1125 for six sessions) and clearly defined touchup prices.

I think if I do go with this, they had more training and their practice was obviously doing very well.  They were very clear and upfront with their prices and processes.  I also liked that they had registered estheticians as part of their team as well.

Price: Midrange

Packaging; Nothing fancy. Just a plastic squeeze bottle with a flip cap.

Texture: Feels like lube. Lol

Application: It spreads really easily. A few drops is really all you need to cover your face/neck/chest. This bottle is going to last a really long time. 

EDIT:

This is sold as a ""lotion"" but I definitely put a moisturizer on top of it. I don't think that it would work well alone. Me thinks the Japanese have a different definition of the word lotion than English speakers. Or maybe that's just the best translation. But definitely use this WITH a moisturizer. This + CeraVe cream = heaven. 

I've been using it for about a week and I absolutely adore the results. It doesn't sting my sensitive skin at all. My skin is supple, acne-prone skin then I definitely recommend this product.

**Ingredients:** Distilled water, Witch Hazel Hydrosol, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Cactus Extract, Calendula Extract, Sodium PCA

I chose this product for an AHA wipe because it contains a blend of glycolic and lactic acid, aloe juice, cactus extract and candelula extract, but it didn't seem to cause me any trouble (nor does it smell pepperminty).  

**Packaging and product description:**  The product comes in a wide-mouth, so that's good!  The smell is a little funny - kind of pungent?, but I think it's the witch hazel.  It dissipates within a minute or two.  

**Application experience:**  Upon application, which stops it.

**Application frequency:** I find that it works best to apply this every other night.  I tried using it every night but it was too much - the ""tingling"" got more uncomfortable every evening

I am fairly pale and had only minor differences in skin tone (slightly darker where the skin is thicker, but I do have sebaceous filaments on my nose and chin, and forehead pores, that I aim to minimize.

1372894509.0,1hlmwh,So... just a friendly piece of information that I think may help many of you with constant dry and peeling lips!!!,angryspring,31,4,40,"I actually saw a post like a few days ago and commented in it. It was a user who had constantly peeling lips. I was surprised

For those of you with constantly dry and peeling lips, and are constantly peeling, that is not just being chapped. Your lips are most likely actually inflamed. I've noticed two common types of chellitis- exfoliative chellitis and angular chellitis. (I only have information on these two and not the other forms!) Exfoliative is when your lips constantly peel-- and I mean really consistently. Angular chellitis is the same deal, except it only affects the corners of the mouth and not the whole lip area. I had... both.

See, they would begin to crack and peel. I would smile and feel my lips split. It was awful. 

Here's the thing- while I notice many people recommend vaseline in this sub, that can actually prevent them from getting moisture. In some cases it can actually wick away moisture. I think vaseline is okay to use when you have normal lips, maybe even lips on the slight drier side. It's okay for chapped lips but I don't think it's very good for chellitis.

I would apply vaseline religiously but while it provided temporary relief

I switched to aquaphor- which still has petreoleum, they weren't back to being what they used to be.

I did a lot of research and I read that many others with chellitis hadn't benefited from vaseline either! So it wasn't just me. Many people said that the vaseline had actually worsened their condition over time

OMG. My lips don't feel tight anymore. They are doing so much better you guys; they don't peel at all

So please try this :) I'm not saying vaseline is bad, give this a go, okay?

Oh and you don't have to necessarily have to use a red eos lipbalm but I highly recommend the lanolin. Well I recommend both, use it! Also understand that there are plenty of rich moisturizers that don't have petroleum. This definitely worked for me though.

1365893863.0,1camee,First impressions: Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46 Sunscreen,niccig,31,3,3,"By request

First off some facts:

Available from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Eltamd-Clear-SPF-48-Gram-1-7/dp/B002MSN3QQ) for $20.20 and Prime-eligible. 

Active ingredients: Zinc Oxide (9.0%)

Inactive ingredients: Purified Water, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyisobutene, PEG-7 Trimethylolpropane Coconut Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane

I've heard good things about this and haven't found a facial sunscreen that I liked much yet

First off, if you're actually measuring (I did). As always, it seems like a *lot* of sunscreen. Aside from that, the packaging is really nice. It has an airless pump, the bottle is nice and compact, and the lid snaps on tightly.

The texture is sort of like a light moisturizer. It definitely is white when you first put it on, rubbing it in until it clears out isn't uncomfortable at all. Once it's all rubbed in, it doesn't feel greasy or dry; just feels like skin. It does leave a tiny bit of shine at first, which seems to go away after a few minutes. One thing worth noting - one day (Thursday, maybe?) I didn't really spend enough time rubbing it in, and it balled up a bit/looked white in places when I went to put on my makeup. Just fyi.

As far as makeup goes, and a couple different foundations (Clinique Even Better Makeup and Kevyn Aucoin SSE). As far as I can tell, the wear time on everything was normal, and it didn't make my skin any oilier or drier than usual. Wearing it without makeup is sort of a non-event (as it should be) - there's really no indication that it's there once it's rubbed in well. 

I generally don't have very sensitive skin, which they usually don't. The sunscreen, however, didn't sting even a tiny bit. Based on that, I'd be pretty comfortable recommending it for sensitive-skinned folks, as long as you don't have known problems with chemical sunscreens. I haven't noticed any increased pore clogginess or anything like that either, though of course I'll update if that changes. 

I haven't had a chance yet to give it a full test as far as actual sun protection. I did walk to lunch a couple of days (around 30 min round trip in the sun each time) and didn't notice any change in my nose freckles

Another thing that I liked about this particular sunscreen is that it contains niacinamide, I'll take whatever help I can get in that arena, since I have type III skin and acne really did a number on it. If it's not effective, then at least it's a good product otherwise, and still worth the price.

Overall

**Edit to update:**

I tried this out on a long run to test its sun-protecting abilities - after all, and was out in full sun for just over 90 minutes. Please note that this sunscreen doesn't claim to be water resistent or sweatproof - in fact, the usage instructions even say to use a waterproof sunscreen if you'll be sweating or swimming. But I thought running would make a good test for it anyway.

Even though I was sweating like a lunatic, not more gross than I would have looked anyway). I didn't reapply while I was out, and I didn't get any tan lines around my sunglasses. I *did* get a slight tan line along my shirt in a spot that I missed (used Coppertone Sport for my body, btw), so I'm pretty confident in EltaMD's sun protection.",,False,t5_2tbbg,True
1365705685.0,1c5grz,Review of many self tanners I've used and some application tips.,yvva,35,9,25,"*Please note this is from my personal experience with these products. YMMV*

I have a [Fitzpatrick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzpatrick_scale) Skin Type III. I'm warm toned and half Lebanese.  I have a natural tan at about a MAC NC40 and without being in the sun I'm around a MAC NC23-25.

Many self tanners give me hives, since not all tanners do this.


All of the following I mention will stain sheets, hang out in sweatpants all day, or use sheets you don't care about. 


*Application tips*

For the best application of mousses I highly recommend using a mitt. Makes a massive difference. The mitt is also good for after you spray the aerosol cans on the body to blend into skin better. I like st tropez, but they each provide something unique. 


*For getting hands and feet*:

I find that using the leftover on the mitt gently rubbed on the hands and feet works out really well.  (I'll apply a dab of lotion at the end to the tops of my feet if I didn't use a mousse/aerosol spray. 


Or for hands only

*Pre-tanning tips*: 


1. Exfoliate in the shower using something non-oil based and shave legs ( if applicable).

2. Do *not* apply lotions or anything oil based after you get out of the shower.  I learned the ""no lotion"" thing from a girl who ran one of my favorite spray tanning places--after I listened to her advice



**TANNER REVIEWS**

**Fake Bake, definitely leaning more towards the orangey side, so I wouldn't recommend this if you are very fair. Better to use if you already have darker coloring or a tan.


**Xen Tan, but not orangey like Fake Bake. Need to wear latex gloves for these as well or have Boraxo handy ( Found this gets the tanner off hands like a gem. SO uses it to clean his hands from work) 

The **Luxe dark lotion** is very very thick with a weird green tinge ( like St. Tropez as well). Tends to be a bit streaky around knees and elbows. I find the Dark lotion is best for face, butt. On the legs It's a PITA to blend because it's not especially emollient, but I've mixed with a bit of moisturizer to help spread it and it never affected the color.

The *Weekly Dark Luxe lotion* and the *mousse* ( can't remember if it's a weekly mousse) are great. I'll lump them together. They give the same color. Buildable for sure and the lotion is quite moisturizing. I sometimes mix a teeny bit of the Dark regular lotion with the weekly lotion to adjust the texture.


**St. Tropez**: Pefumey scent, leaning golden. More golden than Xen Tan by a TEENIE bit but not remotely like fake bake.

The *Original Lotion* is top notch. It delivers a strong initial color but much of it washes off in the shower. I found this to be basically foolproof in terms of any streaking. If you use it every night for a few days you end up looking like you spent the week in the sun. It gives me the same color I would if I were at the beach. Easily mixes with regular lotion.

The *aerosol can* I like because it's easy to do the back and face and I don't need to touch it. The *mousse* is good for legs and arms when used with a mitt because it takes no time at all to apply. I decided to stop using the Everyday because it takes too long to deliver color and the color is definitely more yellow.


**Sun labs, barely any tanner smell when the scent disappears. I use this for my face &amp; arms ( mostly), torso, and back. This is a very different color, unlike the others. It's red based, so you end up reddish bronze vs orange bronze, if that makes sense. This will streak pretty easily if you don't blend it immediately. Again




**Other**:  I've quickly test patched and broke out in hives so I can't make any comments about the color: BareMinerals &amp; TooFaced


**Drug Store brands** These won't do anything to sheets from my experience  


1. *Jergens*   Leaves a strong self tan smell

2. *Banana Boat*: The one with the clicking dial. I found this kind of a pain to apply, even for me.

3. *Loreal Sublime, but nothing significant. There was a small self tanner smell after the fragrance disappeared. 

4. *Olay everyday lotion*: This was decent, it leaves a bit of a shimmer too. It sweats off easily like the Jergens did, and I got minor hives on the backs of my thighs. I wouldn't use this if you have pale skin or if you're cool toned. You'll likely end up tinted an odd color. It gives a nice boost if you already have some color to your skin.  To note: This is my review from when it first came out a few years ago so I don't know if they've changed the formula.


5. *Netrogena Build a Tan*: I actually used this for awhile before I switched to the higher end brands. It has light citrus scent, I'd say this was one of the better ones.

Iwostin is a Polish brand of dermatological skincare products that is like a slightly cheaper version of Avene.

I think I was not only purging from starting Stridex, my skin stopped forming new pimples and withing three days healed all of the ones I had.

The clogged pores I was worried in my previous post are almost gone. My skin doesn't look at oily. The Hydratia cream is made specially for dehydrated skin and it was amazing for me. My skin has no problem with making oil to keep in moisture, if soaks in super fast and leaves skin velvetty and matte. I can't feel anything at all on my skin once I apply the cream. I tried adding ridiculous amounts of it one evening to see just how much can my skin absorb. I had to throw in the towel because it seemed no matter how much I was putting one, everything would get absorbed.

And other newbie questions on my routine and a bunch of products.,kittydorkdork,35,6,23,"One of the very few pleasures I have in life are hot showers and baths. Tonight I found some info through the sidebar saying they need to be avoided. I think I also saw some mentions of it in a thread or two around here. But... WHY IS IT BAD and should I REALLY stop doing it? :(

So on to other questions, that's how nasty and suffocating it feels. Since I've gotten into makeup I've been scrubbing it off in the shower/bath with [these](http://www.amazon.com/Kushies-Pack-Wash-Cloth-White/dp/B000BUTC8U/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=12DQVAB1VK6F0&amp;coliid=IB2HXCQKG6QEF), with no soap, and that seems to work fine. So I guess that's my skin background for ya.

And a note on financial stuff: I recently started making my own money for the first time in YEARS so I'm spoiling myself with some of this

**For Face

For lips: [This lip balm](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JJ2DO6/ref=oh_details_o01_s01_i01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) all the time. [This lip scrub](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KZ6710/ref=oh_details_o01_s02_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) every other day or so. I'm beyond exctatic with this combo. My lips were peeling and uncomfortable until the very day I started using these. If I miss out on using them for too long

Usually just for hands and feet a couple times a week: I had a [sample bottle of this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OYJ9AO/ref=oh_details_o03_s01_i01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) years ago and it was awesome and I cherished the shit out of it. Bought a big bottle of it and it's not quite as good as I remember it but it's not bad. Thoughts?

[If it counts at all

So uh. That's my routine so far. I'm looking to expand it because I'm enjoying this so damn much. I wish I had started earlier in life!

**More makeupy related but still important here?**: I've used [this primer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ME1GUC/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) a few times (I admittedly didn't scrutinize the ingredients but it's supposed to be all organic and shit which is no excuse) and I've been using [Skin79 BB cream](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Z6K2T8/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) instead of foundation and I LOVE IT. Also I like to think it's good for sunscreen purposes as well? I'm open to suggestions on a different primer. 


**Now for some stuff I want to get or am thinking about getting** (keeping in mind I'm still in Spoil Myself mode):

[The infamous CeraVe cleanser for sure](http://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Hydrating-Cleanser-12-Ounce/dp/B000YJ2SKM/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=12DQVAB1VK6F0&amp;coliid=I2IZO6Q6XJWNYK) once a day to remove makeup or just get my skin clean before bed. I'm not interested in the moisterizer since I have my jojoba oil. That's fine right? 

[Maybe a toner

[For maybe a once or twice weekly exfoliation

[For Sunscreen

[Speaking of BB cream, or as a setting powder for my BB cream. This is also something I can be dissuaded on buying, but I do really want to try a setting powder. This is probably more of an issue for /r/MakeupAddiction.

[Lastly, you know?

One other question I have that I tried getting answers about on /r/MakeupAddiction is... my eyelids are really wrinkly. I've seen thousands of girl's eyelids online and they all look tight as a god damn drum. I'm guessing that all these years of rubbing my eyes (my one other pleasure in life) is to blame. Not sure

I bought 2 new Japanese sunscreens looking to replace my Shiseido urban environment.  I was finding that the urban environment is a bit too mattifying for my preference.  ( Though not to the extreme of LRP's Anthelios). 


Anyhow


I bought this off [ichibankao](http://www.ichibankao.com/Pages/default.aspx) and went for the smaller size


Moving along......The texture really like a light lotion/gel. It leaves no white cast and rubs in immediately.  It has a very faint almost citrus scent---much much less than the Urban Environment.


I don't think those with oily skin issues would prefer this sort of texture since it has no mattifying properties


It left my skin feeling very very soft all day. Dare I say


I only used it for incidental sun exposure--walking to coffee, etc---so I can't really comment how well it would hold up if I were to be hanging out outside for longer periods of time.


I'm also not sure about any luminizing effect aka did I look like edward cullen while I was outside in the sun.  I don't think it leaves any sparkle or shimmer

1370798148.0,1fzmn8,1 month since dermatologist and I still need help!,A5H13Y,29,5,47,"Hi there! I [posted here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1dwk86/going_to_dermatologist_in_2_days_what_should_i/) about one month ago (and you can see the ""before"" pic there). My face currently looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/iejJFeH.jpeg) (which looks much worse compared to the ""before"" pic

So

* Taking Doxycycline Hyclate 100 MG 2x a day
* Morning: Acanya (Clindamycin Phosphate and BP Gel 1.2%/2.5%)
* Night: Tretinoin gel microsphere

Other than this

First off, and I really try to do that, but I don't always get to wait more than 5ish minutes.

So here is how these new prescriptions work into my routine:

**Morning:**

* Wash with CeraVe for oily skin (my skin is very oily)

* Scrub face with Sephora exfoliating mitt (since my skin is so incredibly flaky in the morning)

* Apply Acanya

* Moisturize with CeraVe AM

* Antibiotic after breakfast

**Night:**

* Antibiotic afer dinner

* Remove all makeup with makeup removing wipes

* Wash with CeraVe for oily skin (in shower)

* Apply Tretinoin gel (I really try to wait 20 min before doing this

* CeraVe PM moisturizer OR the Cerave in the tub

Now, but it's still there. I'm also getting a lot of new acne bumps along my chin (it's mostly the right side! the left side isn't nearly as bad!), and I really don't think I rest my chin on my hand or anything. Also, maybe I just have to keep using Tretinoin longer, but it really doesn't seem like my clogged pores are going away. 

I'm forced to scrub the flakes off my skin in the morning, even though I don't really put it that close to my eyes. Still, mid-day, my skin starts flaking again and it's super embarrassing. At this point I'm usually at work and can't wait to get home (where sometimes I do nothing and other times I take my makeup off, wash my face, and scrub some more). By night, it's the same deal all over again.

I'm going on a trip to NYC in the beginning of July to see a friend I haven't seen in a little while... I have my brother's graduation party at the end of this month.... I can't possibly imagine lasting the whole day

If anyone has anymore help for me it would be appreciated so much! Thanks!

My wedding is at the end of July of this year. I have some issues with bacne (not severe, the bigger issue is the brown spots I have left on my back. 

Right now I am using benzamycin gel to help treat the acne but I really need to get rid of these ugly marks on my back. I have been reading through other posts and it seems that a chemical peel may be a good idea. 

I was wondering if anyone could recommend specific products. I have seen some of you mention the peels from MUAC and visited their website but I am not sure I understand what peel I should start with ('TCA peels' - whatever that means - seems to be like a good one that will produce fast results

If it matters, in general I don't have sensitive skin, and I have never used a peel. Also, I am in Canada if that makes a difference at all.

Thank you!!!

* The user could search for a product by either scanning a barcode or typing the product name into a search box.
* The user will receive a rating of the product based on how many irritants or comedogenics are included in the ingredient list. The rating could either be something like ""excellent, bad"" or something like the smiley/frownie faces that cosdna uses.
* The user can tap on each individual ingredient to find out what it does (emulsifier, etc.) and how irritating/comedogenic it is.
* The user can save a list of ingredients that they know their skin reacts badly to. If the product they scan includes one of these ingredients
* The user can save products to a wishlist/shopping list to reference/buy later.

The idea is that it would be helpful tool to use while shopping

Part of the project requires me to interview members of my target audience (skincare addicts)

* How old are you? (Do not have to answer

Who can skip it: Women with normal, almost everyone. Toners often overdry these types of skin, triggering the sebaceous glands to pump out more oil in an effort to prevent dehydration. The result: rebound greasiness and more breakouts.

Mostly from L to R: 


**Green Tubby**   is whipped shea butter + small amounts of argan, and sweet almond oil**


* On top of the green tubby L to R:*    


 * Chanel Hydramax ( a splurge product)
 *  sample of Algenist Concentrated Serum
 * MUAC Vitamin C serum
 * Sample of Mario Badescu glycolic acid toner



**Natural Aqua Gel: The Cure**  I JUST got this before I posted the pic.


**Embryolisse 24 hour cream** Just got this



**Cerave SA**


**U-Lactin** ( I use it on my face and body)


**Cerave tub**


**Coconut Oil**  Got this from whole foods WAY overpriced


**Hyaluronic acid** The green bottle. I mix this with a few drops of water before applying so it will be effective.



**Squalane Oil** ( in front of the Cerave Tub) 


**By Terry Rose Toner** The pink bottle.  It smells nice



**June Jacobs Papaya Enzyme Mask** My #2 splurge product. It can be wiped off or washed off or left on for intense hydration. It smells DIVINE and this jar lasts for ages. It comes with a little scoop too.



**St Ives Exfoliating Pads**



**Alpha Hydrox 14% Glycolic Acid Wipes**



**Clinique Moisture Surge Intense** This is a gel/creme hybrid that is pretty nice. But downside is it smells HORRIBLE.



**Sample of MUAC's Pumpkin Mask** 5% Glycolic acid. I need to get the full size.



**Johnson &amp; Johnson baby oil with cocoa butter**  I don't recommend you acne prone folks to use this on your face. I use on my face and body after my moisturizer.



**Argan Oil+Jojoba Oil** In the big green bottle.



**Sweet Almond Oil with Vitamin E**



**MUAC's Honey and Oat Cleanser** It's really drying. I won't repurchase but will use up. 



**CVS brand baby oil** Got this bottle to test out mineral oil on blackheads on my boyfriend. Now I use it to take off my makeup.


**MUAC Green-Tea Pomegranate Cleanser**  Black pump in the back right.  This is amazing. Only other cleanser aside from Clinique's that doesn't strip my skin.  The BF refuses to buy anything else. We have 3 backups.


**Clinique Extra Mild Liquid Facial Soap**  SO great for dry skin. If I have a sunburn or do a chemical peel though I use the MUAC green tea


**Shiseido White Lucent Sunscreen**  White bottle in the front


**Walgreens brand Petroleum Jelly**  I actually prefer the texture of the brand Vaseline. So I won't repurchase this.






**Items not pictured**


* MUAC: 55% Lactic acid peel, 15% TCA peel, 15% salicylic acid peel, 2  mini bottles of their pH balancing toner ( witch hazel/lactic acid)


* Clarisonic Hydro Cleanser ( it came free with my clarisonic a few years back) 


* Cerave Hydrating Cleanser-- it's in the mail


* Alpha Hydrox Oil free 10% glycolic acid gel


* Queen Helene Mint Julep Mask


* Persagel 10


* Bobbi Brown Extra Repair Moisturizing Balm


* Random assortment of Beautymate sheet masks


* Murad Pomegranate face lotion ( the SPF in this is totally unstable due to clear packaging and how old it is


* LUSH Buche de Noel face scrub/wash


* Retino-A .025% and .05%  ( these aren't US rx products

Overall I think pearl powder is pretty good. The biggest benefit I found was that it whitens your skin **a lot**. There's a noticeable difference, I think the powder did something for my pimple scars. I think it healed it a bit and it isn't as visible.

Biggest limit is that it dries out your skin...but if you're like me

1357574975.0,164hq9,Acne information: Beyond the Basics Patient Information from UptoDate,yvva,28,3,14,"ACNE OVERVIEW — Acne is a skin condition in which the pores become blocked

Effective acne treatments are available to treat existing pimples and prevent new ones from developing. In addition

**HOW DOES ACNE DEVELOP?**

 There are four basic steps involved in the development of an acne lesion.

Hair follicles become blocked with an overabundance of normal skin cells (figure 1). These cells combine with sebum (an oily substance that lubricates the hair and skin)

The glands that produce sebum

Numerous sebaceous glands are found on the face, upper back, and upper arms.


The increase in sebum production allows for the overgrowth of bacteria that normally lives on the skin.

Bacterial overgrowth causes local inflammation


**ACNE CAUSES**


Hormonal changes — Hormonal changes during adolescence cause the sebaceous glands to become enlarged and sebum production increases. In most people with acne



Less often


Acne tends to resolve between ages 30 to 40, which predominantly affects men. Acne can flare before a woman's menstrual period, especially in women older than 30 years.


External factors — Oil-based cosmetics may contribute to the development of acne. Oils and greases in hair products can also worsen skin lesions. Water-based or ""non-comedogenic"" products are less likely to worsen acne.


People with acne often use soaps and astringents. While these treatments remove sebum from the skin surface


Diet — The role of diet in acne is controversial. Some studies have found weak associations between cow's milk and an increased risk of acne, high-fat foods or chocolate increase the risk of acne.


Stress — Psychological stress can probably worsen acne. In several studies of students



**ACNE TREATMENT** 

 There is no single best treatment for acne


Acne skin care — Skin care is an important aspect of acne treatment.


Skin hygiene — Wash your face no more than twice daily using a gentle non-soap facial skin cleanser (eg, or Dove® bar) and warm (not hot) water. Some providers recommend avoiding use of a washcloth or loofah, and instead using the hands to wash the face. Vigorous washing or scrubbing can worsen acne and damage the skin's surface.


Do not pick or squeeze pimples because this may worsen acne and cause skin swelling and scarring. It can also cause lesions to become infected.


Moisturizers — Use of a moisturizer minimizes dryness and skin peeling


Sun protection — Some acne treatments increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight (eg, avoid excessive sun exposure and use a sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher before sun exposure. (See ""Patient information: Sunburn prevention (Beyond the Basics)"".)


Can I treat my own acne? — If you have mild acne, sulfur, alpha hydroxy acids, or tea tree oil, all of which are available in non- prescription strengths. A combination of these treatments may be more effective than using one single product alone. (See ""Light-based, adjunctive, and other therapies for acne vulgaris"".)


If you do not improve after three months of using non-prescription products or you have moderate or severe acne


Noninflammatory acne — Noninflammatory acne causes whiteheads or blackheads without redness or skin swelling (picture 1).


Retinoids — Topical retinoid medications are often recommended for noninflammatory acne. Examples of these medications include tretinoin (Retin-A®, adapalene (Differin®) and tazarotene (Tazorac®).


Retinoids are usually applied once per day


Most retinoids are available in a gel or cream. People with oily skin may prefer gels because they have a drying effect


Retinoids can cause skin irritation. While using topical retinoids


Other acne products — People who cannot tolerate retinoids may try other topical medications, or azelaic acid (Azelex®, Finacea®). All of these treatments can be helpful in reducing noninflammatory acne, and azelaic acid may reduce acne-related darkening of skin.


Mild to moderate inflammatory acne — Mild to moderate acne with some inflammation (picture 2) is usually treated with topical retinoids (see 'Retinoids' above)


A combination of two medications, is more effective than treatment with one agent alone.


Benzoyl peroxide — Benzoyl peroxide is usually applied twice per day. It may be combined with a topical retinoid, and it can bleach clothing, towels, bedding, and hair.


Topical antibiotics — Topical antibiotics (creams or liquids) control the growth of acne bacteria and reduce inflammation. Topical antibiotics include erythromycin, and dapsone.



Moderate to severe inflammatory acne — For people with moderate to severe inflammatory acne (picture 3), Sotret®) may be recommended. Topical medication may be used in combination with oral treatments.


Women often benefit from hormonal treatment with a birth control pill (see 'Hormone therapy' below).


Oral antibiotics — Oral antibiotics work to slow the growth of acne-producing bacteria. However


Doxycycline and minocycline are the most commonly prescribed oral antibiotics for acne. They cannot be used during pregnancy or in children less than 9 years of age.



Oral isotretinoin — Oral isotretinoin (Amnesteem™, but that brand name is no longer available


Oral isotretinoin is usually taken in pill form once or twice daily with food for 20 weeks, isotretinoin is sometimes given at a lower dose for the first month of treatment. After treatment is stopped, improvement can continue for up to five months.



Side effects and risks — Despite its positive effects, pharmacists, and patients regarding the use and prescription of oral isotretinoin. Prescriptions of isotretinoin are regulated by the iPLEDGE program (www.ipledgeprogram.com), which requires the following:


All women must have two negative pregnancy tests before receiving a prescription


Women who could become pregnant must fill their prescription within seven days of receiving it; after this time


Any woman who is or might become sexually active with a male partner must use two forms of birth control for at least one month before starting therapy and continue until one month after stopping isotretinoin.


Women who cannot become pregnant and men must also participate in iPLEDGE


Information about oral isotretinoin can be found at the United States Food and Drug Administration web site


A variety of non-pregnancy related side effects may occur during isotretinoin therapy:

Dryness or peeling of skin, muscle pain, nosebleeds, difficulty wearing contact lenses, and sensitivity to the sun may occur during treatment.


There is concern about the relationship between isotretinoin and depression and suicidal behavior. While there is not enough evidence to conclude that it causes depression or suicidal behavior, or anxiety to their healthcare provider.


Isotretinoin can cause increases in blood levels of triglycerides (fatty substances related to cholesterol), and changes in the blood counts. It is unclear whether isotretinoin treatment increases the risk for inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.

While many of these side effects can be managed without stopping the drug, triglycerides, liver function, and blood counts.


Hormone therapy — The hormone estrogen can help to offset the effect of androgens (hormones responsible for acne development). Estrogen treatment in the form of a birth control pill is sometimes recommended for women with moderate or severe acne. (See ""Patient information: Hormonal methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)"".)


Not all oral contraceptives should be used for the treatment of acne; some can actually worsen acne. Certain types of intrauterine devices (IUDs) and some injectable forms of birth control also may worsen acne. Discuss the best options with your healthcare provider. (See ""Hormonal therapy for women with acne vulgaris"".)


Other medications are available to reduce the effects of androgens in women, spironolactone can cause birth defects.


The benefits of birth control pills and other hormonal medications may not be noticeable until three to six months after treatment is started.



Acne and pregnancy — Many acne treatments are not safe for use during pregnancy. Women who are pregnant or intending to become pregnant should consider stopping all acne treatments before becoming pregnant. If acne therapy becomes necessary

**EDIT** Just found some nice brief stuff from uptodate!!

&gt; **Alpha hydroxy acids** — The most commonly used alpha hydroxy acids are glycolic acid and lactic acid. Alpha hydroxy acids are weak organic acids that cause desquamation and diminish corneocyte cohesion

&gt; Alpha hydroxy acids in low concentrations and buffered alpha hydroxy acids in higher concentrations are available as over the counter washes, and at-home peel systems. High concentrations with more free acid are used in the office to perform superficial chemical peels.

&gt; **Salicylic acid** — Salicylic acid (0.5 to 2%) is a beta hydroxy acid available in a number of non-prescription gels, cleansers, pads, and masks. It is a desquamating agent, and its lipophilic properties enable it to penetrate the pilosebaceous follicle, producing a comedolytic effect [1]. Topical salicylic acid also possesses mild anti-inflammatory properties.

*Problem statement*: Certain products ""ball up"" on the skin after other products are applied over them.

*Educated guess*: Many products contain thickening or gelation agents.  Common thickening/gelation agents include [hydroxyethylcellulose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyethyl_cellulose), which means they aren't going to be too happy being around oils.  When cosmetics products are applied to the skin, these agents will remain as a residue on the skin.  By mechanically rubbing the skin, they are rubbed off; by using an oil, they want to ball up to minimize the contact between their oleophobic surface and the oil.

*Minor support*: In the aforementioned thread

A few months ago I discovered /r/SkincareAddiction and started the Beginner's Skincare Routine (CeraVe foaming, hoping it would help my sensitive and blemish-prone skin. But alas, I saw little to no improvement. It seemed like I was getting more bumps! I was in denial and wanted so badly for this to work, it seemed to have helped so many on SCA! I thought maybe my skin needed more time, I tried too much too fast and needed to even out. After two months I had to throw in the towel. 


I started switching products out, skin texture started to smooth out and break outs started to clear. 


I learned my lesson


You have helped me so much SCA! I have some questions for you! I know Spectro brand isn't readily available everywhere but has any one else had much experience with their products? Is there a weekly treatment/mask I should try to continue to help my skin's texture? I have tried Aztec Secret with ACV and it seems to be too drying/harsh for me. Should I give CeraVe products another chance? I still have so much product left and I suspect Stridex was the major contributing factor in my lack of success

My story:
I have had stubborn acne since middle school. Lots of angry red bumps that hurt. I also had a lot of little dots covering my forehead that NEVER went away, even though my parents tried to help me. In high school, I learned how to better apply makeup to hide the acne (and acne scars) but even trying a real face washing regimen, my skin didn't change. I was so frustrated. I felt embarrassed when I had to look people in the eye and I would only allow friends to face certain sides of me in order to hide the worst acne spots. I hated natural light because I showed how much makeup I had on. I hated swimming with friends because the makeup would wash off. And I refused to let my boyfriend (now husband) to look at me when I woke up in the morning because he would see my face without makeup. I wore a full face of makeup almost 24/7 which in turn made my pores clog worse. It was a cycle.
Finally, and because of my working environment, I was able to get honest advice from friends on particular products ranging from makeup, to skincare, to perfume. I also had access to free samples. I began using a product called Stri-Vectins Get Even Brightening Serum.I took home a couple samples to give it a shot because the bottle price was about $80 for 1.7 oz and waaay too expensive to take a chance on. I bought the product intending to use it to lighten my acne scars. Also, after seeing phenomenal results from customers I had sold them to, I bought a Clarisonic (employee discount gave me half price off of $120).  My skin has never felt so smooth before. It literally got everything out of my pores. After about a week of the Clarisonic, 2). I had never felt so excited and confident. It seriously changed the outlook I had on myself. But the samples ran out and the bumps came back. I caved and bought a bottle
My husband got transferred and money got tight because we were budgeting. Once my stri vectin ran out I didn't buy anymore because I didn't want to spend the money. My acne came back fast. I believe stress had something to do with it too. I put off buying it, and I am once again acne free. I am finally unashamed of my skin. And I will NEVER stop using this product.
If anyone has an idea of why this product worked so well
My current skin-care routine is to use my clarisonic twice a day, after my stri vectin. I am also on birth control, and I know that is helping a lot too.
SO:
Clarisonic: One-time $120
Stri-Vectin: $45
Clinique: $30ish?
Garnier: $20

EDIT: Nolan, Moisturizers: Reality and the skin benefits. Dermatologic Therapy, 25: 229–233.           Here is a quote I read earlier about the efficacy of petroleum jellies   ""There are four main classes of moisturizers: occlusives, humectants, emollients, and rejuvenators.

Occlusives
Occlusives work by forming a hydrophobic layer on the surface of the skin providing an exogenous barrier to water loss. Because they prevent evaporation from the skin

Although occlusives are not the most appealing of ingredients to consumers, the prototypic occlusive, it is actually the most effective moisturizer and reduces transepidermal water loss by 99% [7]. Petrolatum is the most commonly used active agent in skin care products, after water [1]. Occlusives are well tolerated among individuals and are often used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. A recent study [8] found that an over-the-counter (OTC) petroleum-based skin moisturizer (Aquaphor Healing Ointment, Beiersdorf, Wilton, CT) was as clinically effective in treating mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis as a more expensive ceramide containing prescription barrier cream. Petrolatum also can help restore the stratum corneum barrier by penetrating into its upper layers and initiating the production of intercellular lipids, sphingolipids,False,

The breakouts are large, painful and all over my face) and that no matter how I much I try to get the oil off, it just builds up more during the day. My biggest concern yet is regarding the sebum plugs. Everything I have read about OCM swears that in the first five minutes of using OCM for the first time those sebum plugs should start coming out. Well, it's been five days and not a single one has come out and that makes me think that this probably isn't for me.

I haven't cut in a long time - probably somewhere around 10+ years. I know that the scars will probably never go away, they're bad). 

However, some of them (especially the larger ones) have dimples around the edges??? Here's [some pictures](http://imgur.com/a/c7k4M). They ""dimples"" are darker than the scars and my skin - more of a purple/red-ish color - and significantly more 'sunken' than either of them, as well.

I know it was stupid, but it only happened once, the burn wasn't bad (just a little red on my thighs - didn't hurt at all), and I've learned my lesson. This couldn't be sun damage so long after the fact when my legs haven't been exposed to sun since (literally - they haven't seen the light of day since then), right???

In what order should I apply these? And at what time of day?

I don't wear any during the week, dark eye shadow, ect) and I usually use makeup remover towelettes which hurt my face when I rub too hard. Would mineral oil be enough to get all that makeup off?

1368464829.0,1e95qu,What sunscreen do you use and why?,orata,24,3,33,"Face and/or body. I'm not looking for tailored recommendations for me--I'm interested in knowing what products **you** personally have arrived at based on your own criteria (whatever those may be) and research.

I'll go first. I'm still experimenting: 

I love [Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46](http://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=129120/Elta_MD_UV_Clear_SPF_46/0/Sunscreen) for the following reasons:

* feels very light and dries clear
* high SPF
* zinc oxide for partial physical protection
* mild--doesn't break me out or sting if it gets in my eyes
* niacinamide for skincare benefits

I'm still experimenting with others because: 

* apparently the PPD isn't great. 
* It would be nice if I could find an all-physical alternative because I often don't remember to apply 30 mins before going out in the sun
* It's a little expensive (but I'm willing to buy it at that price point). 
* the packaging is kind of annoying; hard to tell how much is left until you just suddenly run out.

I just ran out of this and am now trying [Shiseido Hada Senka Mineral UV Gel](http://web1.sasa.com/SasaWeb/eng/product/viewProductDetail.jspa?itemno=105938212001), and looks/feels great on the skin so far, but comes in such a tiny bottle and is slightly annoying to source (I bought it from Sasa, but they're now out of stock--I know I can get it on eBay or Amazon, but it's sort of annoying to have to look around). I will have to see how I like it once I've used it a while longer.

Skin type: combination but fairly well-behaved/non-sensitive, but it always made me feel so pasty and streaky.

1366910574.0,1d3ewq,Finally found my holy grail cleanser for oily skin with large pores! Wanted to share.,sie_liebt,26,4,30,"I ordered the SKin79 O2 BB Cleanser. It finally came in about 3 days ago. In the past three days of using it

I'm normally *very* oily. I deal with large

This cleanser is pretty interesting and kind of fun to use. It comes out as a gel that you massage onto your dry face. For two minutes, you massage it back down into your face, rinse with lukewarm water, and pat dry. 

I was a little skeptical that it would really cleanse off my makeup, shrinking if you will. I've had no new irritations or breakouts and the ones that were healing appear to be healing a little faster than normal. I use it morning and night and for the first time in my life, when I wake up, my skin isn't oily. I'm all around astounded and I really just needed a place to gush (none of my guy friends really care all that much about the goos I put on my face). 

Have any of you tried this or any other Asian cleansers? How did it/they work out for you? Anything anyone knows that I should be worried about using this product (I'm always waiting for something awful to ruin the good things lol)?

I know a lot of people cry out against Lavender Oil because they heard it was cytotoxic (I was one of them until I started *reading* about the issue). I'm pretty certain the scare has to do with a misinterpretation of research. Lavender Oil was found to be cytotoxic *in vitro* to endothelium cells (lining the interior of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels) and fibroblasts. A 2005 study states: ""although it was recently reported that lavender oil, contact dermatitis to lavender oil appears to occur at only a very low frequency. The relevance of this in vitro toxicity to dermatological application of Lavandula oils remains unclear."" And in 2007 a team of European researchers testing photosensitivity in relation to lavender oil and sandalwood oil found: ""Lavender oil and sandalwood oil did not induce photohaemolysis in our test system. However, a few reports on photosensitivity reactions due to these substances have been published, e.g. one patient with persistent light reaction and a positive photo-patch test to sandalwood oil."" So, please, spare me the diatribes about how ""terrible"" Lavender Oil is. I used to give them. And I was as misinformed as anyone else. ",,self,,

After testing my old standby Aveeno 30 SPF sunscreen (on that sunscreen filter site I can't find a link for) and seeing how low the UVA protection was

So far I've used it about 5 times a week for the past two weeks and I think it would work for any skin type, so if you have really dry skin you may want to use the [Cream instead of Milk.](http://www.bioderma.com/en/nc/the-products/what-s-new/product/action/215.html)

The protection is excellent. I feel super protected. It's super sunny nearly every day where I live and I have very fair, I don't get any pinkness. It seems to really stick to my skin but I'd still definitely reapply it every couple hours if I went outside more often. (I am only using it for incidental sun exposure like walking to my car.) It's marketed as water resistant as well, though I can't confirm that since I haven't gone swimming or anything in it (yet). 

It's a runny, it leaves a slight rubbery/sticky  feel to the skin. The box says it has a ""velvety effect"" but I didn't experience anything like that. It doesn't make my skin look oily after application but it does give off a sheen. It's not that bad though. I tend to use a pretty decent amount of sunscreen so if you only use a little, you might not experience all the sheen and rubberyness.

I haven't have any adverse reactions. It doesn't make me break out or look oily

I haven't had any adverse reactions mixing it with other products.

I would definitely re-buy. My only gripe is that I wish it were moisturizing so i didn't have to wear a seperate moisturizer and sunscreen at once.

* Clenia Foaming Wash - prescription face wash. A couple times a week I use this instead of the DDF; it's a little too drying to use every day. I'm not really sure why they call it a 'foaming' wash

* Retin-A Micro .04% - oh man. This stuff. Prescription. I stopped using it for about a month back in August, maybe? It's been pretty much standard operating procedure. For a couple weeks my skin was pretty dry, then it broke out horribly for 3-4 weeks. For about the last month my skin has been slooooowly healing up from that, but it still looks pretty bad.

&gt; The gold standard for hyperpigmentation therapy in the United States remains hydroquinone. This substance predated formation of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and some of the generic 4% hydroquinone formulations, only available by prescription. Other proprietary hydroquinone-containing drugs that have undergone FDA scrutiny through the investigational new drug pathway have well-established safety and efficacy validated through carefully controlled large-scale vehicle-controlled clinical trials. Many new hydroquinone formulations have appeared in the last 2 years in physician-dispensed lines, but these products have not undergone clinical study. It is this plethora of hydroquinone-containing creams for sale in many different markets that has caused health concerns.

&gt; There are several important health issues that need to be considered before determining the safety of hydroquinone. For many years, hydroquinone remains controversial because it may be toxic to melanocytes.

&gt; Hydroquinone, functions by inhibiting the enzymatic oxidation of tyrosine and phenol oxidases. It covalently binds to histidine or interacts with copper at the active site of tyrosinase. It also inhibits RNA and DNA synthesis and may alter melanosome formation, thus selectively damaging melanocytes. These activities suppress the melanocyte metabolic processes inducing gradual decrease of melanin pigment production (5). Issues regarding the topical toxicity of hydroquinone arise because it is a strong oxidant rapidly converted to the melanocyte toxic products, p-benzoquinone and hydroxybenzoquinone. These byproducts may cause depigmentation.

&gt; Hydroquinone is very difficult to formulate in a stable preparation. It is a highly reactive oxidant that rapidly combines with oxygen. Typically

&gt; Prescription hydroquinone formulations have tried to increase the skin-lightening potency of formulations by adding penetration enhancers such as glycolic acid or tretinoin as a supplemental pigment-lightening agent. Other prescription formulations have added microsponges to create time delivery of hydroquinone to the skin

&gt; The future of hydroquinone in the United States is still uncertain as of this writing. Apparently

&gt; The potential withdrawal of hydroquinone from some of the US markets and its removal from European and Japanese markets has spurred interest in developing pigment-lightening alternatives. The remainder of this discussion will focus on other pigment-lightening ingredients and their relative efficacy and safety as compared to hydroquinone.

I read that LaRoche Posay Anthelios sunscreen is a good mattifying screen...however, I'm wondering if there is a difference between the lotion vs.the fluid? I am acne-prone with combination skin, with my t-zone being particularly oily by mid-day.

Secondly, actually, because I think the shade is off, though - suggestions?), but I also occasionally use Covergirl's Clean foundation for extra coverage. Would I be able to use these products after a sunscreen?

**PART 1**

Hi everyone.

Last I bought skin products

With that being said

I have Combo Skin. Dry on some places

- How big is CeraVe in the tub? 
- How big is CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser?
- What's the best sunscreen I can get that is big in size and great in quality? (I use Piz Buin


**PART 2**

I'm going to buy these products based on the rave reviews they've gotten around here. They seem to have a great quality/price relationship compared to other products on the market. 

However

Mornings:

I use a cleanser and I apply a moisturizing sunscreen by Synchrorose.

Nights:

I do Oil Cleansing. I put Olive Oil, warm washcloth to pat my face and let the remnants of oil sit on the face. I don't rinse the face after patting it with the washcloth (which I think I am doing wrong!). 

After Oil Cleansing, Synchrorose Fast (meant to get rid of red marks) or Metroderme, each on top of the skin with the remnants of oil. **Again, don't know if this is recommended, enlighten me please!**.

On Saturdays I apply 8% Glycolic Acid and that's my routine for the week.

What I am trying to insert now is the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser and the CeraVe Cream on the tub. 

Morning:

- Cerave Hydrating Cleanser
- (**Do I moisturize here?**)
- Sunscreen of your recommendation.

Night:

- Oil Cleansing with Olive Oil. 
- Stridex
- Synchrorose Fast/Metroderme in alternate nights/Glycolic Acid on Saturdays.

Is this confusing/wrong? That's why I need you, the noob!

I was hoping that people who use the OCM could post their combos here so other people who are new to the OCM could see what people are using. I know another combo a lot of people like is castor oil:grapeseed oil (1:3) or the traditional castor oil:sunflower seed oil (1:4).

**Skin type/history.**   So, though occasionally I would get a cystic pimple or two around my period) was a problem for me, though the derm said it was not severe enough to Rx accutane.  I never had issues with dry skin, though I live on the East Coast of the US where the air is never arid.   Much moreso than acne, I suffered from blackheads through my teens/twenties.  Retin A helped with that.  Up until this year, I would have described my skin as ""slightly oily"" but otherwise okay.  I would get by using cetaphil cleanser and not much else.  

To the extent it's relevant, I had the kind of skin that tanned easily or sometimes burned and turned tan a day later.  Now, I rarely vacation, work often, and am hardly ever outdoors.  This is great for reducing UV exposure, but my skin has become extremely pale and on vacation it burns and peels before even beginning to tan.  I generally buy the lightest shade of any brand of makeup.  That's not my complaint; it's just some background info.  

**Recent developments.**  I haven't moved apartments or climates or made any other drastic lifestyle changes, mostly on her nose, and I think I might be seeing early signs of the same.  These symptoms have also started to spread to my cheeks, in the t-zone area near the bridge of my nose.  While acne previously coincided with oily skin, my skin also feels extremely dry now -- I don't even use cetaphil (or any cleanser) anymore, because my skin is already so dried out.  

In the morning, and it helps with the dryness but the acne-type symptoms persist.  

A friend who did an atkins-type diet reported that cutting carbs had helped her skin, but my face still looks like I do meth.  (For the record, I do not). 

I do make sure to drink plenty of water.  I also take a standard multivitamin (albeit iron-free)

I abandoned Retin A long ago, but price is not an issue.

Hopefully you're all excited and rearing to go with testing out the Aztec Healing Clay Mask.

Here are the guidelines:

- Please post a picture of your skin **before** starting anything. We'll have a thread each week during the process

- It's really critical that you take the image(s) with the same lighting

- These weekly threads are meant for discussing the product

**General guideline on how to use this product

1. Use it twice a week. Decide on 2 days at the start

2. If possible

3. Combine equal parts of Aztec Healing Clay with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV). If you really don't want to use ACV

4. Apply to your face as necessary (*More details from users would be great!*). Let it dry for 10 minutes (delicate skin)

5. Remove by washing with warm water.

For a long time (probably 5+ years) I used Proactiv. I never really had acne or breakouts when I was a teenager. My mom used Proactiv so I started using it when I ran out of the face wash my aunt had gotten me (no idea what it was, a day with Proactiv and left it at that, except for picking/popping/generally agitating my skin because I didn't know it was wrong.

After I turned 18 I battled with pretty bad anxiety and started getting mild breakouts. Mostly blackheads

Later last year, which seemed to make my skin too dry. Then I tried 9 to 5 and Ultrabland. They didn't cause irritation or dryness so I continued using those for a few weeks.

I went to the dermatologist this year for a full body check (I have lots of moles and freckles) and the only things she suggested were 2% salicylic acid wash and a Clarisonic unit. Can't really afford the Clarisonic at the moment so when I went to get the 2% salicylic acid wash I was afraid that it would be too harsh (based on the Proactiv ""sunburn"") and just got a 0.5% astringent, mostly). I read the Beginner's Skincare Routine and ordered some CeraVe Foaming Cleanser and St Ives No-Scrub Exfoliating Pads and have been using those for the past week or so.

So now I have [all kinds of washes and other junk](http://imgur.com/a/ZHy5i) and I have no idea what to do with all of it, what combinations are good, when to use what, etc.

That's my history (sorry it was so long!) and now here are my questions:

* The CeraVe Foaming Cleanser doesn't have salicylic acid
* How do I use the St Ives Exfoliating Pads properly? Do I just swipe them over my face real quick or do I sort of..massage my face with the thing or what? Super thin layer or get as much as I can on my face? Do I rinse after or just leave it?
* Should I be using any other things I have or just the CeraVe cleanser
* I am still finding blackheads and I have had a cystic(?) acne thing just under my nostril for weeks now that hasn't gone away (although it did get smaller...after I messed with it because I have a hard time not doing so) and I think I have milia
* Should I try to get the Clarisonic unit or is that just frivolous?
* I have no idea what I'm doing please help? ):

1369501422.0,1f1bnw,[Review] Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Exfoliating Facial Pads,Boofle,21,4,7,"**UPDATE** Just got word back from Nip+Fab

**Preface** - This product was purchased by me in a desperate attempt to make something of my dry/30 year old/stressed out skin. After trying mechanical exfolation with Lush - Angels on Bare Skin I decided that it was just too drying for me so onto chemical exfoliation I go.

**Zee Product** - 

**[From Boots](http://www.boots.com/en/Nip-Fab-Glycolic-Fix-Exfoliating-Facial-Pads-60s_1285979/)**

**[From Nip+Fab's Site](http://www.nipandfab.com/shop/best_sellers/glycolic_fix/49)**

**Claims** - Unveil younger-looking skin with our innovative Glycolic Fix. 60 radiance-boosting pads

With a hydrating formula

glycolic acid retextures + resurfaces

hyaluronic acid moisturises + refreshes

blue daisy  soothes + calms

**Ingredients** - [Here](http://i.imgur.com/DQM82Fo)

**How I use it** - Just as it says on the tin. Wipe pad across face, after cleansing.

**My Thoughts** - First Impression - The tub they come in looks nice. Quite posh without being dowdy. The lid is a little ill fitting though so make sure you screw it on properly or all that glycolic goodness will dry up, but not overpowering in any way. It smells clean and fresh.

Apparently these are 6% Glycolic Acid concentration so a little bit higher than some of the other solutions available. The pads are nicely saturated and although they may seem small they do cover a lot of ground. The pads feel lovely and cool on your skin and unless you already have sore areas they don't sting. They may tingle a little but it's not a bad sensation. Please remember that some products may sting when applying after using these.

I expected my skin to feel tight afterwards but these seem fairly hydrating so people with oily skin may not need a moisturiser after use. Also bear in mind that if you have any broken skin on your face that it will sting. The only fault I would say with these pads is that on my skin they seem to leave a slightly sticky feeling. It's nothing that makes my skin uncomfortable or really irritates me

I've been using these a week so far. I do like the way they feel when using them and I do feel my skin is smoother and a lot of the flaking I had between my eyebrows is gone. Another plus is that some of the blocked pores I had on my upper cheeks have diminished and overall my pores don't look as noticeable. I will update this post before I finish the tub with my final thoughts and whether I'll repurchase.

**Pros:** *Feels lovely on skin *Easy to apply *Nicely saturated so enough product to cover what you need *£12.95 pricepoint is a nice bonus. *Smells lovely.

**Cons:** *Slight sticky feeling (could just be my skin!) *Lid of the tub can be a pain!

One thing that IS consistent is that I always have gunk on my nose. I currently am doing OCM, than to use more harsh chemical filled products that have the same result.

The redness isn't actually that noticeable in person/indoor lighting (makeup covers it).

Hi everyone, hope that's ok. Below are the details, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

**Background:** 30 years old, then extreme cold in the winter), fairly sensitive skin all my life – dry for the most part, kind of oily T-zone. Acne was never really a problem until 2–3 years ago when I started breaking out a lot. Saw a naturopath and removed certain foods from my diet, did a candida yeast diet which definitely helped everything. Basically completely acne-free for the last year (no medications or creams were used).

**Diet / Lifestyle:** I try to eat really clean, no eggs, no honey b/c of food intolerance) but I'll have whole wheat, fish/chicken maybe once a week, and maybe a little processed meat like prosciutto bi-weekly. Exercise level is high. Been trying to drink about 4–5L of water a day. Using SLS-free toothpastes/shampoos.

**THE PROBLEM:** Check out the gallery of my cheeks here: http://imgur.com/a/hkNBT A dermatologist I saw 3 years ago (when my skin/acne was at its worst) said it could be rosacea (I *am* very red after exercising) causing the redness and clogged pores

Day-to-day, which I'm sure isn't normal. (My cheeks used to be ITCHY all the time, but again, changing my diet helped fix that).

**OLD skincare regiment:** wash my face with plain warm water at night only

**Current regiment:** wash my face with plain warm water at night only, but seems to be minimizing my clogged pores a lot, in addition to making my skin feel softer.

I know this isn't enough. What are your thoughts and recommendations?

I want to try the oil cleansing method (thinking maybe 10% castor oil to 90% sunflower oil?) but I am concerned that the whole process might make me breakout again (when I have been enjoying clear skin for months). I am getting married in October and don't want to mess with my face too much (the make-up artist can definitely take care of any redness I am currently experiencing).

Has anyone else battled this same problem? Thanks for reading this wall-o-text... ",self,t5_2tbbg,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1bveab/red_dots_and_clogged_pores_on_cheeks_photos/

(Sorry no pictures
My skin is a mixture between oily and combination. Mostly really oily on my T-zone area and I have breakouts sporadically all over my face. Sensitivity wise i would say 6-7/10 (10 being most sensitive). After my shower

Then I used **CURE**. 1-2 pumps was all i needed from the bottle. Its VERY watery (probably coz its 90% hydrogen water :3) and a foggy/clearish color. Best part is that there is NO SMELL. None of that alcoholy or fruity smell you get with other products. Left it on my face for about 30 seconds and then started rubbing in circles all over my face. After about 30-45 seconds of rubbing

Afterwards I used a Q10 Coenzyme toner (also from daiso) and then used a hyaluronic acid cream. TODAY- my skin FEELS SO SOFT. OMFG. I feel that CURE really opened up my pores and removed all the dead skin to let the products work to their full potential. Its only been one day but im hooked! New favorite product by far!

TL;DR/Rating: 9.5/10 (0.5 off because it says to use it twice a week

I know some others also just got Cure and i would LOVE to hear your reviews!!!

AVOID these.  The scrubbing bits are made of crushed walnut shells. This causes micro-tearing in the skin and over time you will be an unhappy camper. I'm SURE some of you are reading this and shaking your head because you've used it for years and see no damage



Philosophy microdelivery exfoliating wash or any others with very minute particles:


Try to steer clear of these. While they don't cause as egregious damage as the shell based scrubs

I have to take about 3 Pan acid pills a day, moreso than it does after a peel. The Zinc tablets can cause an upset stomach if not taken with a meal. 

On the plus side, and I honestly thought Id have to just live with it for the rest of my life.

For reducing the scars that were left over, and TCA peels though, as well as MSM (sulfur) cream and AHA/BHA creams.

I'm a 26F with what over time I have discovered is slightly dry, my parents put me on Proactiv. My face looked great but after years of bleaching towels and having horrible breakouts if I missed even a night of the routine, I realized something wasn't right. Long story short, BP ruined my face for a while as I tried to use more natural, forgiving products. I went through months of weaning myself off the stuff. 

Right now I am looking primarily for a night moisturizer or cream to put on my face before bed. I have been using my daily moisturizer for this

Here is my current regimen 

Morning:  

Aubrey Organics Vegecol cream cleanser  
Thayers Witch Hazel Toner    
Tea Tree oil applied directly to pimples     
MAC mineralize water eye cream (sometimes
Olay All Day Moisturizer SPF 15       
(I also wear some light coverage makeup with SPF)  
 

Night:   
   
Wash off makeup with Sweet Almond Oil   
Cleanse face with 100% Raw Manuka Honey (Active 16+)   
Thayers Witch Hazel   
Tea Tree Oil on any blemishes.   


From time to time I also apply the Proactiv Step 3 cream as I am STILL weaning myself off of this wretched skin addiction.    

I would like to add more moisturizing and skin-loving natural ingredients to my regimen

I'll admit it, my skin does not get overly oily. But, the oiliness of my skin depends on the weather too.

I bought the CeraVe because I heard good things about it on this sub

**TL;DR:**

My questions:

1. Is there a 'cleansing/detox period' or 'adjustment period' when switching face products before seeing better results?
2. If not
