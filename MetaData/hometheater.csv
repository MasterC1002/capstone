**Demo discs**

Demo discs are made of clips of movies or music that show off different aspects of your home theater, the surround sound, or the musical aspect. I'll list a few here.

Superleo at avsforum has made a demo disc and is currently in the process of releasing another:  

[Reference Blu Ray Demo Disc 1](http://www.avsforum.com/t/1391873/reference-blu-ray-demo-disc-bd9-dvd-dl-media-bd50/0_100) is the first one, bass, animation, and music and a pretty nice menu system as well.

[Reference Blu Ray Demo Disc 2](http://www.avsforum.com/t/1469192/reference-2-blu-ray-demo-disc-bd9s-bd50/0_100) is the second one, animation and music.  You can download each segment as it releases, and then there will be instructions added to combined them all into a Blu Ray.

[Ultimate Bass Demo Disc](http://www.avsforum.com/t/1412846/the-ultimate-bass-demo-disc/0_100) is a compilation of a bunch of clips with fantastic bass.  There is something wrong with the folder structure in the torrent

**Reference Blu Rays**

Why hold yourself to just a clip from a movie

Over at avs, and bass.

[Picture Quality Ranking](http://www.avsforum.com/t/1425519/official-picture-quality-rankings-for-blu-ray-the-tiers-list-updated-through-march-9-2013/0_100) and [Picture Quality Discussion](http://www.avsforum.com/t/858316/the-new-pq-tier-thread-for-blu-ray-discussion/0_100) are the threads to see what are the top of the top of picture quality on Blu Rays. The discussion thread contains all of the summaries as to why Blu Rays are where they should be, so if something is in Tier 0, it's definitely fantastic quality. Note that the link to the tiers in the first post of the discussion thread is outdated and the updated tiers are in the link I put.

[Audio Quality Ranking and Discussion](http://www.avsforum.com/t/1190265/new-audio-tier-thread/0_100) is not as active as the picture quality thread

[Bass Movies](http://www.avsforum.com/t/1333462/the-new-master-list-of-bass-in-movies-with-frequency-charts/0_100) are something a lot of people can smile at just feeling the low frequency. These guys have subwoofers that go below 10 Hz (human hearing only goes to 20 Hz

**Audio Tracks**

I have not seen a demo disc or reference thread on avsforum

[Zeos Demo Music](http://www.reddit.com/r/Zeos/comments/1caxzd/great_demo_music_master_list/) is a list compiled by one of the mods here and it definitely has some great stuff for all varieties.

Really though

So there you have it

1356668138.0,15k18v,How can I soundproof a living room?,Zangeith15,44,9,25,"Back story: Have a job lined up for August and will be renting a house. It will be a relatively small house very likely in a neighborhood where the houses are pretty close. I will be getting a 7.1 Aperion Intimus 5 system with a denon or marantz that is a better fit for me at the time

Issue: I want to know what I can do to properly soundproof my living room so I don't have to worry about my neighbors complaining. Sound traveling throughout the house is fine

Current idea: I have googled this on the internet and found a whole bunch of things. A family member recommended I buy sound cancelling/light blocking drapes at a store and cover my walls in it. I think that it is a great idea in that it could make my living room look pretty cool and possibly soundproof. My family member insists that it would work fine with what I need.

Question to you guys: Is this a viable option (covering the walls of the living room in sound drapes)? Or is the idea not viable at all and a novice mistake on my part.

TL;DR: Would covering the walls of a small living room in stylish soundproof drapes mitigate the sound enough for neighbors not to be an issue? Or

Edit 1: I notice I said things like soundproof drapes

Edit 2: Thanks everyone for the information.  Glad I made this post and hopefully others found it valuable. I'm going to try my best to get a house with a finished basement.  ",self,t5_2rof6,1356730682.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/15k18v/how_can_i_soundproof_a_living_room/

I mostly lurk in this subreddit and take a lot of advice because I'm installing my first ever home theater. I did my research and bought my projector (Optoma HD20), but now that I'm invested and I'm nearing the point where things are going up.. I'm concerned.

My projector will be 13 feet away from my wall; the throw distance says my screen can be 110 inches diagonally. I have a 1080p projector; will the screen still by crystal clear? I'm getting nervous. The largest TV I've ever purchased is 52 inches

I’ve been doing research for the past few months and it gets pretty overwhelming so I’m posting here in case someone might find it fun to figure out the best use of current equipment and what to spend the rest on. I would like to begin putting together a good home audio set-up the right way. I have some budget and some existing gear that could be used to start out and upgrade later. 


* Budget: up to $5


* Right now I am thinking of spending 1, and the reason on this number for the speakers is I demoed the B&amp;W CM9’s and really liked the sound and that’s what they cost. I also listened to some Martin and Logan motion 40’s and liked those too. The B&amp;W’s win out on aesthetics which is important for my wife. If I have extra I’m thinking a subwoofer. 


*I have a $1, Yamaha, and Pioneer receivers and Kef and Definititive Technology speakers. 


* Use: this will be used for music and surround sound for TV/movies.  I listen to rock, soul, hip-hop and some electronic music. Volume is not my primary concern, I have a pretty good set up in my car and that’s where I listen to hip-hop electronic when I’m by myself and can crank it. This in-home set up will be more for classic rock on vinyl, acoustic, soul, concert dvd’s and surround for movies. I’m not an audiophile so this is going to be difficult to explain but I prefer a warm, full sound. I like feeling music. I like to go loud every once in a while but what I really want are those full, I was listening to Friend of the Devil last night and loved trying to follow each instrument. The first time I really felt this (outside a concert or live music show) was when I upgraded my cars stereo to an alpine receiver


* The room: 13x15ft with a 4’x1.2’ bumpout. 3 windows, small area rug. I’ll post pictures if I can figure out imgur. Any suggestions on room treatment welcome. 


The primary questions are:

* Should I go for a pre-amp and amp set up right out of the gate or go with a receiver? I was planning to go for a good receiver but then started hearing how separate components is the way to do it right (down the rabbit hole we go...). I don’t really want to spend a lot of time fine tuning and setting up a bunch of different connections but would be interested to hear the pros and cons for each. 


* If a receiver only any recommendation on a Denon, pioneer, or yamaha. If I can get something fantastic for less than the 1200 great. I would like it to have Audiseey or some other EQ room calibration. 


* Any ideas for other ways to use the existing equipment that I have listed below. Also any feedback on whether you think I’m making the right decisions in what to invest in first. Right now, i just wondered if I could use the JBL’s as rears and the technics and the 6th and 7th)

Existing equipment:

* Marantz 2230 vintage receiver


* Bose model 360 turntable


* Panasonic DMP-BD30 Blu Ray player


* Apple TV


* Samsung LED 800 Smart TV - I just got this TV and I love it. It’s got wireless


* I also have an old Technics receiver SADx940

 
Speakers:


* Kef model 90 Type SP30178 center channel


* pair of Bose 301 floor standing - these are a little beat up after lending to a friend but was considering these are rears until I upgrade


* pair of Klipsch KG3.5 floor standing - these are too big to pass the wife test so will likely stay in the basement
an even bigger pair of Kenwood speakers


* pair of JBL 2600 bookshelf speakers


* Technics SB-C80 center channel


* pair of Technics SB-S50 cubes these and the above center were part of an old surround set up

For my TV I have the Panasonic 60ST50 which is just amazing on its own.

I bought the Denon 1713 receiver to power the audio.  This little box is amazing as well with its ease of setup and many many options to play with.  Its heavier than I expected and well crafted.

Using Zeos's tips

I was going to also use a B652 as the center channel but ended up buying the Dayton Audio CCS-33B 3-Way Center Channel Speaker instead.  I built a shelf behind my TV in which the speaker sits flush with the edge of the screen and aimed down towards ear level of the sitting area.  I am still tweaking this a bit to get the right volume level but will need to do it all once again once I have the speaker stands in place.

For the Sub I purchased the Dayton Audio SUB-1200.  It was actually a few dollars less than its smaller brother the SUB-1000 so I couldn't go wrong.  This thing is a beast with its 12"" speaker and heavy.  I have this sitting between the TV and the front right speaker.  I thought it was defective at first as I would not get any sound from it at all until I realized I needed to turn it on and not just plug it in.  oops.

I had a PS3 attached for Blu-ray but since its remote is bluetooth and I wanted a universal remote

I bought the Logitech Harmony 650 remote.  Easy online setup and does what I want it to do.  Its nice having one remote instead of 4.

First movie I put in to test it all out after setting everything up with the Audyssey feature was the Blu-ray version of Avatar.  As much as I didn't think it would matter all that much

I just now need to pick up a wireless bridge so I can get internet access to the Denon and I will be all set.

Although I've found guides online (from reddit, and others), many of them offer conflicting configurations and don't lead to any better results.

If you could throw audio fidelity out the window and just optimize for the best compression, if you think any of these sites already have the best settings and I'm expecting something this feature can't truly deliver on, let me know.

In case you are wondering, using my computer as a media management/playback device. Lots of MKVs, web video. I already equalize for less bass because the sub is over powered compared to the L/R for my room size, and it helps with dynamic range.

I bought the seating new on EBay. I paid about $1800 for it. They have butt-kickers but I am not a fan and don’t use them all that often.  The basement is a walkout type and there are two big windows in the room which I cover with a pair of blackout shades.

The projector is a Sanyo Z5. I am very pleased with it. Live sports over cable look great. I watched the new Mission Impossible blue ray last week. Even though the movie was as bad as I expected the opening scene in Prague (?) was gorgeous. Deep blue sky with well detailed architecture. Sometimes some images just jump out at you.

It hangs from the ceiling 13’ back. The screen is 106” on the diagonal. It wasn’t anything special. I don’t recall the brand but I bought it from Tiger Direct for under $200. And yes I know my ceiling needs to be repainted. 

http://i.imgur.com/KNfRP.jpg

The speakers are all Polk. I believe they are Monitor 30’s in the front and Monitor 20’s for the surround. I followed the guidance of the experts and put the speakers on the side instead of the rear. I am not sure I am happy with this

The electronics are a Pioneer receiver 

http://i.imgur.com/fhC7s.jpg

And this is a great feature.

http://i.imgur.com/nnblO.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/NYROG.jpg

Not exactly cableporn but it makes life easier.

If I were to change anything I would like to have the LCR speakers mounted behind the screen. Whenever I have the opportunity to hear a system like that it just seems more realistic.  I would also like it to be just a bit wider so getting into the rear row was a bit easier.

I hope some found this useful or interesting.

If anyone ever worried about what pure white looks like on a grey screen I can guarantee it is very white. Blacks are very black and I am running in ECO mode @213watts vs BRIGHT mode @264watts. The brightness drop is so small(+5% maybe) I wouldn't even consider the full bright mode.

My situation is a bit odd. Since my monitor (CRT Sony GDMFW900) requires some gamma tweaking in software I had those tweaks carried over to the projector when in clone mode. So I had to hammer for about 3 hours to get perfect color and gamma matching on the projector via the RGB and Gamma/Skin tone/Color Temperature settings of which this projector has more settings then any TV I have ever used. A tweakers paradise(or purgatory?)

I recently had a break-in and my LG [50PS60](http://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-50PS60-plasma-tv) was stolen. Now that I have some money from the renter's insurance policy

I'm a big believer in plasma TV's picture quality, though. Plus, I was really happy with the picture quality I had, excepting the image retention. I've read all the stuff about break-in and thought I took the necessary steps with the LG I had, but maybe I didn't...

That said, especially with moving images. I noticed a difference when I was at Best Buy between 60, 120, and 240 Hz refresh rates, and I don't think I'd be happy with anything other than 240 Hz. Could it just be Best Buy messing with the settings to make me buy the higher-end models? Also, I've got a (possibly) irrational fear that I'll be missing out on something with the edge-lit vs. local-dimming LED back-lights. Pro's for the LED would be that sexy ultra-thin profile, and no image retention.

I'm looking to stay in the 50"" or higher screen size

I just don't want to have to try and decipher all that crap if I can help it. Plus, these guys seem to be super-serious about picture quality and having the deepest blacks, etc. I just know that I can see a marked difference between plasma and LED.

The thing that got me most excited is that I am now certain these speakers are actually manufactured by Energy.  I noted previously that the speakers looked nearly identical to the [Energy Take Classic 5.1](http://www.energy-speakers.com/home-theater-systems/?sku=TK-CLASSI-5-1) system.  Other than the striking visual similarities and the identical technical specifications

I completely recommend these speakers for anyone who needs a compact set-up OR doesn't have a huge budget.

**Other notes and my questions:**

* Next year

* This comes out to be about $4000, so I have no problems paying more upfront for a better experience. Originally, I was going to piece together my own speaker system, but the reviews for this set were so good that I couldn’t resist. However, I am still open to any other systems or buying individual pieces—or even buying the pieces that I can afford now and adding in the rears over time (This was my original plan). I would love any input about possible improvements to this system since this $7000 was set aside for my home theater!

* Is this receiver compatible with these speakers? Online resources about wattage and resistance left me confused. I have a background in science

* Since this is my first ever home theater

Seating, which has the awesome ability to either be a comfy two-seater for us or split into something more accommodating for company.

The room is not particularly large; it's approximately 10' by 14.5' (the last two feet being closet space, we'll probably be 7.5'-8' from the image).  I threw together a quick idea of how it all could fit [here](http://imgur.com/0DndW9n).

* From what I've read, so perhaps I can go a step down there to the [Epson 3020](http://www.amazon.com/Epson-V11H501020-PowerLite-Theater-Projector/dp/B009EPSJXM) (I've loved our 8350 so am partial to Epson, but if there's something that's better, I'm all ears).  I would also consider doing a [Goo Systems](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/696120-REG/Goo_Systems_6371_High_Contrast_Screen_Goo.html) paint job for the screen instead, but I like the idea of having an acoustically transparent screen behind which I can place the center speaker.  And in that vein, if anyone knows of another company that can eek out even more screen space on a 120""-wide room, I'd love to know it because my wife is firmly in the ""bigger is better"" camp.
* Is the speaker system I've chosen the best bang-per-buck available?  I'd be willing to shop different speakers from various companies but I do like the sleekness of a system built to look great together (plus the package deal comes at a lower price).
* Speaking of sleekness
* Is a room of this size at all viable for a 6.1 or 7.1 setup?  If so
* Is there any part of this budget that's either overdone or falling short

Im driving everything through a [Yamaha RX-V767](http://au.yamaha.com/en/products/audio-visual/av-receivers-amps/rx-v767__l/) which I picked up second hand for a great price.  I really wanted something with two hdmi outputs so I could send to my tv when not watching things on the big screen.  NZ$550

I then kept my eyes peeled for either the 9.1 or the 10.1 Wharfedale bookshelf speakers

1370562555.0,1ftt65,Onkyo TN-NR616 AV Receiver: Control Raspberry Pi/XBMC via HDMI/CEC/RIHD?,derzaub,12,3,10,"Hi!

Quick question - is it possible to control XBMC on a Raspberry Pi - or any other device for that matter that supports CEC - directly with the control of the Onkyo remote?

My TV doesn't support CEC (it's a ""non-Smart"" 55"" Samsung TV - hence the Raspberry)

I activated ""HDMI Control(RIHD)"" on the Onkyo

I did understand that correctly

Also: here's my setup so far for clarification: http://imgur.com/zl3C7fr

PROGRESS!

---
And: SUCCESS!
---
A guy named sneftel on the libcec forum said that he had similar problems on a different device - ""Make XBMC the active source when starting"" should be the culprit
Reenabling libCEC or restarting XBMC then showed that it works perfectly. :)

So in short:

- Get XBMC with libCEC enabled (I use a normal raspbian install with precompiled XBMC

- Configure your remote to send CEC commands (for my Onkyo
- Get a well written keymaps/remote.xml mapping file

- Configure XBMC to use the AVR device and disable every option

- Restart XBMC

- (Hopefully) you've succeeded. Only one remote to control them all. Hooray!


If you're unsure whether libCEC does work or not

So for the over-the-air HD I looked into what kind of antenna I wanted to get. The search wasn't too hard since I live within a 5 mile radius of my city's broadcast towers (literally I can see them from my house). So I'm gonna keep it simple with an indoor omnidirectional antenna like [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Paper-Thin-Leaf-Indoor-Antenna/dp/B004QK7HI8/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354135409&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=HD+antenna). 

As I was looking for a new streaming device

Either pay a monthly fee for DVR with a turn-key box or setup my own recording software on my media server. My main interest in the turn-key Boxee is that I get those few apps I dont have on Xbox/PS3 and I'm pretty sure it will handle the audio processing of over-the-air HD for me, etc.

Now for my bedroom TV I already have an extra BD player in there so movie access isn't much of an issue. I originally was thinking about getting a Roku XS 1080p box but then I noticed it doesn't support UPnP servers (which is the protocol my media server uses to push movies/music). While it has a crap ton of apps, a perfect app for bedroom enjoyment (which the PS3/Xbox/Roku have). Furthermore if I went with the HDHomeRunner option as my main DVR device, I could convert the files to a format the PS3 would read easily.

So what's the best solution for me?

1) Boxee TV DVR + Boxee TV (no DVR service)(Bedoom TV) - $198 + $9.99/mo

 * +Optimized audio processing

 * +Turn-key ease

 * +DVR support for bedroom TV

 * -$9.99/mo fee

 * -Not as many apps as Roku

2) Boxee TV DVR + Roku XS - $198 + $9.99/mo

 * +Optimized audio processing

 * +Turn-key ease

 * -$9.99/mo fee

 * -no DVR support for bedroom TV

3) Boxee TV DVR + PS3 - $359 + $9.99/mo

 * +Extra video game console

 * +Optimized audio processing

 * +Turn-key ease

 * -$9.99/mo fee

 * -no DVR support for bedroom TV

4) HDHomeRunner + Boxee TV (no DVR service)(bedroom TV) - $187

 * +no $9.99/mo fee

 * +DVR support for bedroom TV (via UPnP)

* Single TV
* 6 sets of speakers in 4 zones
* 3 of 4 zones will have volume controlled by wall knob

**Desired Features:**

* Control from simple universal remote (preferably something that can be run on an iOS device. 
* Guests can easily stream their own music (video?) without having to upload anything to a HDD. 
* Maybe Apple AirPlay can meet this goal?

**Need advice on:**

* What brand/type of receiver would be best? I've read that the Pioneer VSX-822-K and/or Yamaha RXA 2000 have good iOS integration. Again
* Are the speakers recommended by the installers ok?
* What else do we need to make this work?

Happy to answer more questions as I'm sure that I'm leaving something out. I've also read a bit about Control4 and really like the system but can't find price information.

After a lot of combing the Internet and coming up empty

My surround speakers are about 12lbs each; Klipsch RB51s.  I needed something beefy to mount them to.  I picked them up cheap from a neighbor who had a 5 speaker set stored in their original boxes before he could get them posted on E-bay.

I cut a 45 degree strip out of a 4x4 using a table saw.  (large piece of wood so that my fingers could stay clear of the blade)  I then cut up this large strip with a miter saw so that each smaller strip has 45 degree bevels on each end.  I screwed the strips into the corner studs using some large and long screws

The ceiling in my living room is raised up into the attic space.  It angles at the walls and then heads up to a horizontal.  It was easier for me to get the cables up into the attic by simply cutting into the angled portion of the ceiling behind the speakers.  I did cut the holes as close to the corners as possible to keep them behind the speakers.  I cut the holes using a series of smaller holes until I was sure that the holes I needed were not obstructed by studs and such.  I used metal brackets for the holes (not pictured) so that I could get the holes as far into the corners as possible. (not possible with the plastic brackets I've seen)  The covers are simply coax outlet covers with the coax connectors removed.  I think these look cleaner than using covers with two connectors typically used for speakers

Running the cable for the speaker shown was a snap.  The other one is in a corner location for the roof and was a nightmare

The mounting strips aren't noticeable at all.  You have to get very close and look behind the speakers to see them.

**A/V Receiver**

**Tower Speakers**

I poked around [Bestcovery](http://www.bestcovery.com/) for some tower speakers

**Wrapping Up**

I'd like to stick to roughly this price range or less if possible, here would be my main questions.

* Decent mid-level entry for building up to a 7.1 setup?
* Would I be better going with a 2.1 system using two bookshelves/sub instead of the two towers?
* Recommendations on-par/better/slightly less but less pricey for my current equipment picks?
* For when I do upgrade
* Can I cannibalize the satellite speakers from the Logitech setup for surround sound without issue while I work towards a fuller setup?

I want to ask if this'll work and if there are any amateur mistakes i'm not seeing right off the bat.
Anyone have anything similar already built? Any blogs which provide detail or tips on changes?
 
As i'm a poor uni student I can't afford this all in one go, but investing in a good router to wirelessly transcode HD movies. I already have decent stereo speakers and a nice 23"" IPS screen. I've saved up to build a really good PC (in this case the GPU needs HDMI out and soundcard needs optical out) which will fill the role of the Apple TV and a 5.1 sound setup will also do for now.
 
**I'm mostly concerned about:**

* Getting the best possible audio quality from my PC without disturbances from the PSU. I think a DAC will be needed
* How I will be able to access the NAS when on the move?
* If my PC can connect to two different sets of speakers.
* If I can download/seed torrents directly from the NAS via my PC.
 
Compatibility comes before anything. I want it to work on Windows, Linux.
Quality comes next. Lots of ugly wires aren't gonna be a problem. I'll work my way through that.

Doesn't necessarily have to be an Apple TV or Synology NAS. Just chose what was most priceworthy and compatible. For now the whole thing should be kept below $1800.

3) For the PC input should I pass that through the wall as well? (which would likely make it closer to 20-25ft if I do that.

So I decided try them out together, but I thought that since both subs have their own amps, it wouldn't be so drastic - like when you switch rear speakers on with a quadrophonic system.

I am also considering doing some home automation using Zwave and a [Mi Casa Vera Lite](http://www.amazon.com/Mi-Casa-Verde-VeraLite-Controller/dp/B007005364/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369923432&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mi+casa+verde+vera+lite). Any way I can tie this into the AV?

I will definitely be wiring each area with 2x cat6 and at least 1 coax

There is also a 32x32 detached garage that I'll have my various projects in that I would want some sort of networked audio to some sort of 2.1 or stereo system.

So any suggestions on equipment, things I should do that you wish you had done initially?

Im not sure whether this is the right move or not but here is my thinking so far

Pros to buying Benq: 
- I'd get a larger image from the distance my projector is mounted (from 100inch to 120)  bigger is better!!!
- Its DLP not LCD (not too sure if this is an advantage?  From what ive read its a slightly sharper image and handles movement better)
- Longer lamp life
- 3D (im really into the idea of watching 3d at home)

Cons
- The benq weighs 3 kg
- I'd loose 800 lumens (but to be honest I am using the pany on a setting that is only using a third of the lumens at the most so not too concerned about this
- There is a bit of faffing around as id have to buy a new bluray player and run some hdmi 1.4 cables to my projector

1) I have always thought (for no reason in particular


2) It is my understanding that the *only* difference between 60 and 120hz is that stuff at 24fps is displayed ""better"" at 120.  What, I don't think.  DVDs?  Regular TV?  When would I come across something at 24 fps?  When this stuff is displayed ""better,"" does that just mean it has that bullscrap super-smooth look to it?  Because I couldn't give a crap about that and would thus have no reason to spend more for 120hz, right?  TV's that run at 60hz don't have this ""super smooth"" feature, correct?


3) Some HDTVs I have come across when gaming have a lag between the button press and the action on screen.  I'm assuming this is some sort of bullshit ""filter"" applied to the image that slows it down.  Virtually every HDTV has an option somewhere to turn that shit off


4) 1080p is the best resolution out there, TV, everything else - that's just at 720 or 1080i, right?  In other words: The only reason I would care about 1080p is if I had a blu ray player?

I've noticed a near complete lack of ""Reviews"" for this TV

It was this deficit of information that leads us to this

This 32'' HDTV is from Samsung's 5000 series of TV.
It features LED ""Full array"" back-lighting (less LEDs than higher end models) and it is unknown if these have local-dimming capability.
These TVs have various panel technologies
Type:
A:Samsung
H:Sharp
P:CMI (chimei)
R:AUO (au optronics)

My TV is a TS01 model with a Samsung (A -type) S-PVA.
(I was able to verify this in-store at my local Best Buy on an Open-Box model).

After running a preliminary calibration:
Mode: Standard
Backlight: 12
Contrast: 100
Brightness: 35
Sharpness: 50
Color
HDMI-&gt;HDMI input set to ""PC""

This model supports 4:4:4 chroma sub-sampling (very important for use as a monitor).

Initial Thoughts: 
These are the best Black levels I've ever seen on a non-plasma set. Compared to my S-IPS U2412m I like this better for gaming/movie/media. Text IS sharper on my Dell but this is due

I am very satisfied with the week I've used this Samsung. 
I picked up the television for $299 after I had them adjust prices for the recent $350 pricepoint set by Amazon/Sears et al.


Cons would be lack of inputs (2 HDMI and 1 Composite/Component)
Cost ($549 MSRP)
Inconsistencies in panel technology (Panel Lottery) with various ""inferior"" technologies.

This panel lottery makes online purchases (And returns) much more YMMV and makes recommending it for purchase a hard-sell. I would say

I would highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for a ""large"" format TV monitor for gaming/media usage and proper displayed text capabilities.

There are TV's that would also work (namely cheaper Westinghouse, this is by and large the best choice.

Questions?

Here's the thing.  If I have them both plugged in

If I unplug the RCA cables from the cable box

If just the cable box audio is plugged in

If I leave both sets of audio cables plugged in but

There is a second monitor on my desk near the receiver

So here's my question, and the tower remains completely unplugged from any power?

Obviously the easiest solution here is a new receiver that actually has digital audio capability... but I can't justify purchasing one for quite some time.  Anyone have an extra receiver with a couple of HDMI ports they'd be willing to part with for $50?

Obviously the solution here is to just buy a new receiver and go completely HDMI and my life will be so much easier.

The other option is to put the front speakers on the 3.5' and 3' walls with a center below the TV.  This looks nicer, as I will always be in the sweet spot.

I haven't really noticed it on my ['09 Viera](http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Series-TC-P50X1-50-Inch-Plasma/dp/B001SN7QUU) so i really don't know if that would even affect me.

I bought my house a year ago and I am in need to upgrade my home theater. My current system consists of:

Bose Companion 3 Speakers - For music

Bose Cinemate Speakers - For TV

Samsung UN46EH6030 46"" TV

Xbox 360

I got both of the Bose systems for free and I am sick of them. (you know what they say about Bose - No highs and lows? Must be Bose!) 

So what I am thinking is

I have a receiver - Yamaha RX-V661 7.1 channel 90W X 7 channels. (Got it for free!)

All I need is speakers. The room is 15' X 15' but including the part where you go up the stairs it's 15' X 27'. (Look at the pictures) With carpet floors with cement under and drywall. I would be using the system for Games, and Movies. I would like it to be able to turn the bass up and really shake the room for music. 

I would like the system to be under $800 for a 5.1 system.

I was thinking this setup:

Polk Audio PSW108 Subwoofer - $180

Polk Audio TSi300 Front Speakers - $340 for both

Polk Audio Blackstone™ TL2 Rear Speakers - $200 for both

Polk Audio TSi CS10 Center Speaker - $100
 
Total : $820

What do you think/recommend? Are those good speakers?

1368469146.0,1e9bka,How to run frequency sweeps properly.,Nerys64,11,4,18,"I am going to be conducting thorough measurements of my system

I have individual channel sweeps, and pink noise per channel. I figured step one is to disable all crossover settings by setting all speakers to large and setting subwoofers to lfe instead of lfe+main. Next I can play the sweeps per channel followed by the 2.1 and 2.0 sweeps,  then the all channel sweep.  This should give me measurements of each individual component in the 5.1 setup. 

Next

Finally

Order of tests would be individual channels sweep ,  2.0 rear sweep, 5.0 sweep, 5.1 sweep.

What do you guys think? I've submitted my sweep tests too and they are floating around if you guys are interested.

I'll have two inputs: a turntable for normal playing of music (not scratching) and a digital source consisting of a massive library stored on a NAS drive via a MacMini.

My concern is whether a rogue analog signal may damage the soundbar and if the soundbar will really capture the warmth of vinyl.

I'm looking to set up 5.1 home theatre sound in a living room with some serious limitations imposed by my wife who could not give two shits about sound quality and cares only about the aesthetics of the room.  

We've a 50"" plasma mounted in a custom recess in the wall opposite the couch in a fairly square room.  When we did our renovations we installed speaker wire in the ceiling based on some advice that I now realize wasn't very good - the setup is that we can have four ceiling speakers, and two more near the back of the room with the same spacing, which would be almost directly above the couch, ever so slightly behind.

So my original plan was simple - two fronts

The more I read about this kind of setup the more I realize that in-ceiling fronts are NOT desirable, you ask?  I cannot say, but the line in the sand is drawn.  So, would directional in-ceiling speakers work here?  Opinion seems split.  To aim at listening ears would require them pointed down at pretty close to 45 degrees.

No problem to hide a sub, clean look to the room that we went through a lot of trouble to get done so I get that she's loathe to take away from that.

Anyhoo, it's TV speakers, so almost anything is an improvement, but I don't want to put in a lot of time, money and effort for something that simply cannot sound good.  I understand that the end result will necessarily be sub-optimal, but how bad are we talking?

        management is wall running with plates. I also suggest putting
        your A/V equipment in a separate area

* 4: Blackout material:

        Most current generation projectors do pretty well with some
        ambient light
        possible. Luckily there is a great cheap way to do this and look
        nice. JC Penny's sells quality Energy Star rated black-out
        curtains for $25-55 in multiple colors. You get to black out ya
        place for cheap
        win win win. Ill link at the end.

* 5 Equipment installation:

        It's crucial at this point that you have all the wiring and cables 
        you need run into the management. Now that you have all the 
        'barebones' of your theater set up
        projector
        For your components (BD player, I suggest 
        moving them into a different area out of site (Closets work 
        great for this). I also suggest buying an A/V rack or you can buy 
        steel-wire racks at Target if you don't want to spend too much.

I've gotten the go ahead from the spouse to upgrade the TV in our living room.  The problem is we are putting it between 2 windows which are just shy of 4 feet apart.

Except the stupid house has 24"" between studs and the one stud between the windows is just about center.  Dumb luck.  

At this point I'm going to go to Lowes tomorrow and get some 2x4s and mount them horizontally between the 2 windows (across 3 studs) and then mount the TV to that.  Has any one actually tried this?  Has it failed anyone?

**The goal:** Build a system that can be upgraded within the next couple of years (after I move in) that doesn't break the bank.

**Requirements**  
1. Has wireless connectivity to stream music from our laptop or phones (iPhone AND android)   
2. Must be around $350 WITH speakers ($400 MAX)  
3. Has at least 4 HDMI inputs

To receive wireless connectivity I am aware that I have to purchase a small wireless receiver.

**My Concerns/Questions:**  
1. Is this receiver overkill? (8 HDMI seems like a lot!)  
2.  Should I spend more on the speakers?  
3. Can we watch TV without turning the receiver on?  
4. How do the different zones work?

First of all

Second, is a 1 year old model. Not that it's a bad thing, but if I'm going to upgrade, I'd like to upgrade to something of the current year.

That being said

Now...the thing is...my future Marantz 8801 already has 2K and 4K upscaling capabilities. Wouldn't it be redundant if my Blu-ray player AND my AVR did 4K up scaling? Shouldn't my AVR just do all that work for me?

Also, Internet browsing, YouTube. That's all well and good, but I'm not interested in all these add-ons. I am simply interested in Picture Quality. The S790 is said to have great PQ...the S5100 also has excellent PQ...as well as the Oppo 103. 

That brings me to the Sony S3100. The S3100 does not have 4K upscailing

What I'm getting at here is, that if I absolutely need to in the future, I can upgrade and buy another unit with little to no buyer's remorse. 


What are your thoughts on this approach? Am I wrong in thinking like this? 

EDIT: Well after doing a great deal of research on blu-ray players today, but blu-ray tech has been out for so long, that it has matured. That's why I can't find a player that doesn't have any of that 3rd party crap on it like Pandora and Netflix...youtube and web browsing. They all have this junk on it because the tech can't get any better. So I've decided on the Sony BDP-D3100. It's missing 4K upscaling, 3D support, and some other stuff that I don't need because my future Marantz 8801 will be taking care of all that. It still has 100s of 3rd-party streaming programs I won't use, but if I ever change my mind and want Netflix, I'll be good to go.

1354672016.0,14ap4i,SVS SB12-NSD review,travelingclown,7,1,6,"So after toiling around with what sub to purchase (velodyne, front firing, and free shipping policies are pretty much unrivaled. 

I have it paired with B&amp;W PM1's in a 2.1 setup, and my PM1's set to small crossed at 80hz so that the yamaha sends the front channel information to the sub. This may change.

__________________________________________________________

Review:

Firstly SVS is fantastic, Fedex, or just some extremely lucky holiday circumstance, but it was perfect timing.

The sub absolutely gets down, and muscle for days. It shakes my sectional across the room, and it's not even at 50% gain. Musically it's not exactly where I wanted it to be, just not as precise as I would like, and not as ""punchy"" I guess I would call it. However I'm having issues getting the yamaha setup exactly as i need for the PM1's and my current room (NOT an ideal room setup), so I'm not 100% convinced the sub is lacking at this point, it could very well be the yamaha configuration here.

As noted above

So overall I'd have to say this sub is very good

I feel pretty good about the receiver choice, my setup is asymmetrical (layout http://imgur.com/DU70K) , so I'm wondering if that would make the Mirage speakers work better. However, I keep seeing great things about the Energy speakers and I'm concerned that the mirage speakers won't sound as clear. 

Another point worth mentioning. I don't care how big the speakers are. If I can get better sound at the same price, so I can't go any higher on cost.

1348263190.0,109pb4,Will a 3.5mm (headphone) cable support 2.1 sound?,linkian19,8,1,10,"Hey everyone. I apologize if this is a very noobish/dumb question.

As the title states will a 3.5mm (headphone like) cable support 2.1 sound?

The reason I ask is because I recently picked up a sound bar system with a subwoofer. I got this because I just wanted some better sound other than built in TV speakers and I don't have the space for a full blown 5.1 or above set up.

The sound system only has a HDMI in. An HDMI out. And a 3.5mm in. It's compatible with ARC but I don't think my TV supports it (at least I couldn't get it to work).

Here are links to the sound system and tv:

 - [TV](http://www.nfm.com/DetailsPage.aspx?ProductID=35191519&amp;cm_vc=pdpz1#.UFzX-o1lSUs)
 
 - [Sound System](http://www.sharpusa.com/ForHome/HomeEntertainment/SoundBar/Models/HTSL75.aspx)

Here are my issues:

 - It doesn't seem like my TV supports ARC so I can not use my sound system that way. 

 - The only way I can seem to get sound is by using the 3.5mm cable from the headphone jack on the TV to the 3.5mm in.

 - TV only has headphone and SPDIF (coax) out for other sound options.

 - My sound system is supposed to turn off an on with the TV. It turns on fine but does not go to standby about 20 mins like it says it is to.

Here is my idea:

 - Get a SPDIF coax cable for the TV.

 - Get a SPDIF to 3.5mm converter - maybe [this one]
(http://www.sharpusa.com/ForHome/HomeEntertainment/SoundBar/Models/HTSL75.aspx)

 - If using the above converter

 - Hook 3.5mm into sound system.

 - Enjoy less crappy sound.

Here is another idea:

 - Get SPDIF coax cable for the TV.

 - Get a SPDIF to HDMI converter - maybe [this one](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA0U00D18127)

 - If using the above converter

 - Enjoy less crappy sound.

So

I am a huge noob when it comes to sound systems and audio equipment and I tried my hardest on to search on Google to find the answers to my questions

I also know that the sound system that I got is not the best in sound quality or what people would necessarily want but I just wanted some better sound without wiring things across my apartment floor (curious cats are not good for that).

So, let me know and I'll try to accommodate.

It should be noted that the gain on the Super Eight was at less than 50% and the system was auto-calibrated with Audyssey

Unfortunately for me it's a little over my head too.  

Right to the knitty gritty:  There are 2 speakers and a volume control in every room of her Bed&amp;Breakfast

http://imgur.com/a/DHXt1

There are 3 rooms in total

Quick googling reveals that a receiver capable of 4-room output runs around $300 to $1k? 

Something like: http://www.amazon.com/Denon-DRA-397-Source-Receiver-Audiophile/dp/B000HD5FWI

Here's my question:  Are there cheaper ways to do this?  Would a regular $70 receiver from bestbuy work if I twisted all the cables into one?

Help me out?

I've got my HTPC/TV set up almost exactly how I want it at the moment. The one thing left to make it perfect is the ability to play my PC games on there.

Luckily, the pc is about 4 meters from the HTPC/TV, if running cables, it's a 10 meter run (it's a rental house, so drilling the walls is a no-no).

There's Gigabit networking to each point

I've been looking at the options, or whacking a big antenna onto a bluetooth adapter and using bluetooth KB and Mouse.

I'm sure this is the kind of question that provokes groans and sighs (in the same way asking r/photography 'what camera should I get?' does). 

I'm looking for some thoughts about what I should be looking for in a low-mid range receiver for what will be the 'B' system in my house. I'm moving to a new place which has a pretty nice home theater already set up

I quite like the JBLs and they look reasonably neat and attractive; the TV is not in dire need of replacement and I'm not terribly interested in 3D. 

The reasons I'd like to replace the receiver are that owing to the age/lowish end nature of the Yamaha, and I'd rather have as few as possible cables going to the actual tv. In addition, without that, the receiver's role as an integrating unit is a bit weak. 

In terms of input, and a Wii - 3 or 4 HDMI inputs would be more than adequate. There's only the 5.1 setup, but I could still purchase some better fronts so I'd prefer 7.1 to be supported. I'm quite happy to go for a slightly older model. I don't need 3D support. Some sort of airplay support would be nice but not required. 

The budget would be less than about $600. My instinct is 'idiot

I am putting together a home theater and the receiver is the only part that I am undecided on. I am a Canadian so all the awesome electronics south of the border are mostly off limits. I've found two cheap options that would fulfill my needs. I only will need 4 HDMI ports. That part I am completely certain off (1 game console, and one spare for possible new acquired electronic). I also think I will only need 5.1. You can try to sell me on a 7.1 system but I need to be able to get it for less than $400 in Canada. 

I found a refurbished and manufacturer certified [Yamaha RX-V371BL](http://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-RX-V371BL-5-1-Channel-Receiver/dp/B004QQXDVC) for $229

The other option is a new [Onkyo tx-sr313](http://www.electronicsforless.ca/audio-3/amplifiers-receivers-13/onkyo-tx-sr313-5-1-channel-home-theater-receiver-2859.html) for $269. I'll probably get futureshop to price match that company so that I can get it from an actual store. 

So I don't really see any big features to differentiate the two besides the refurbished aspect. The Onkyo would be a two year warranty so is non refurbished and an extra year under warranty worth $40? 

I also just found a [Pioneer 5.1 Channel Receiver (VSX-523-K)](http://www.futureshop.ca/en-CA/product/pioneer-pioneer-5-1-channel-receiver-vsx-523-k-vsx-523-k/10241688.aspx?path=4561c6805a885ce2d8bd760e5a68222fen02&amp;SearchPageIndex=1) for the same price as the Onkyo.

Anyways we are going to make our house more useful and spending money on it. Since we will be saving money by staying in our home and not moving to a large mortgage we want a nice room to watch tv

The drawing very quickly done to give you an idea what we are working with

We are both huge hockey and football fans so we want a decent hometheater to watch games on. I haven't decided on what size of tv to get or move what we currently have downstairs.

Currently we have a 46"" samsung.

One thing to note on the drawing is where I am thinking of putting the tv is a brick wall I am not sure if I want to put in flat against the wall or get a corner mount. 

Another thing to note on the ""left"" side marked 12' 6"" there is a small basement window smack dab in the middle - not egress just a small window.

The ceiling is a drop ceiling so I am wondering if I can put ceiling mount speakers in or is this overkill for this small of an area? I've never looked into pricing on these

I do not have anything yet I am just trying to lay out and idea and a budget.

I think for furniture we will will have a larger sofa and one recliner unless reddit points me in another direction.

Key things I am looking for is:
TV - size
Stereo system - Nothing crazy..
