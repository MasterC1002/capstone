*nother edit*  Thank you everyone for the support!  At this time
or comments from this post.  I will see you all near the end of December!





Just shy of 6 months ago, positively or at all.

I used 5 accounts.  Each of the accounts conveys a different personality: 

* Always agreeing and supportive

-Always goes with the most popular comment on a post.
-Makes posts relevant to current trending memes or topics.

* Always contradictory and demeaning

-Always goes against the most popular comment on a post.
-Complains about current memes and trending topics.

* Blissfully ignorant and careless

-Asks dumb questions or points out irrelevant things regarding a post or top comment within a post.

* The coattail 

-Makes useless contributions to posts or comments such as ""lol"" or ""wow that's cool.""

-Always comments about a similar situation he's been involved in as an attempt to garner karma from other redditors. 

-Posts many [fixed] posts.

* Myself

-I post and comment as I actually feel.


Three months into the experiment

Once per day, /r/adviceanimals, /r/funny and /r/wtf and occasionally in another well populated subreddit.   The posts are on topic according to the subreddit with different twists depending on the personality.  I never use one account to comment on another. 

Here are some mildly detailed results thus far:

* The agreeing personality has the highest upvote:downvote ratio of all the accounts.  Redditors responding to his comments and posts are about 95% respectful and intellectual.  He has made the default front page 4 times in 6 months.  After switching this account to a more contradictory personality

* My personal account has the second highest upvote:downvote ratio.  I tend to keep an open mind when conversing with others and do my best to understand where everyone I'm talking to is coming from.
I have never made the default front page.  Most of my comment responses are respectful and intellectual with about 15% being disrespectful or trolls.

* The contradictory and demeaning personality is the third in upvote:downvote ratio.  His account has actually gathered dedicated followers who comment on and correct nearly every post or comment he makes.  He has never made the default front page and is the only account to receive private messages from other users.
After switching this account to the more agreeing personality, even 3 months into becoming a nicer person.  No matter what he posts and what he replies to, he is always received negatively.

* The coattail account is fourth in upvote:downvote ratio.
He has made the default front page once in 6 months.  I switched his personality to one mimicking my personal account.  His upvote:downvote ratio is slowly but surely improving.

* The blissfully ignorant account is dead last in upvote:downvote ratio.  It seems that being a dick is better than being dumb on reddit.  This account has never received private messages
After switching his personality to one more intelligent and informed

So what does all of this mean?  If my (surely) flawed experiment shows me anything, even if you change for the better, there are still likely to be residual effects from your past behavior.  I can't say with certainty that people actually run a quick check on your history to determine if you are worthy of upvote or not, but there is definitely a correlation between your attitude and your performance.

I’m sending you a picture of what my office door used to look like. 

I arrived at my office today to the image of a penis drawn on one of my favorite quotes from one of my favorite social theorists. Then, and the subsequent encroachments of Israeli settlements within that territory. The story of the Palestinians reminds me of the story of American Indians and their loss of their ancestral land and way of life. I bought these postcards when I took my first McNair student to a conference at UC Berkeley. All three of those items were taken from my door… On the left side of the door is/was a postcard of a Chicana in a Rosie the Riveter pose; this postcard is a rare gem and a gift from a graduating student. That postcard was taken, too. Finally, the Occupy Corpus Christi poster was another item taken from my door. A student who played a role in organizing the Occupy Corpus Christi group came by my office last fall. His wife drew that picture and created fliers to try to get people involved in Corpus’s Occupy Movement. He and his wife had a couple of posters made of her drawing and gave one of them to me.

I know that the material I teach can be challenging, explore assumptions, and think critically about what we believe, what we “know” to be true, and the community and spaces we inhabit. What happened to my door saddens me and distracted me, but it does not deter me. Intolerance is everywhere; resistance to new/different ideas will always occur. If you are uncomfortable, then

I hope you have a safe break

I am very disappointed about this suberddit. Looking at others like r/psychology or r/economics

I was reading the description in the box to the right and it says:

&gt;We ask that posts **contain actual sociological content**. We are happy to talk Sociology with anyone

What is even meant by this? Anything can be sociological. 

My suggestion is that we change the rules of the subreddit and make it a serious place where we discuss sociological research. Why don't we just focus on actual studies published on journals instead of submitting every news article that we feel is ""outrageous"" or other opinion pieces that speak about how sociology is perceived as shit by lay people. 

That's my suggestion. Let's moderate heavily this subreddit and use it only for discussion on research. Linking to PDFs and journal articles. 

If you guys don't think that's appropriate for this subreddit then perhaps we could create a new one just for discussions on sociological research published in peer-reviewed journals.

I've almost finished my BA in Sociology, I'm starting to realize, holy shit, I have to put this education to use. I love everything about sociology (well, except perhaps the quantitative number-crunching. Maths makes my head esplode), so I chose the major that I loved, but now I'm worried that I won't be able to find any employment without a Master's. 

So with a BA in Soc, social workers, etc)? Is teaching an option, or is a master's required in most areas? Would I have to take education courses? 

Any responses are appreciated

*Post-Postmodernism:* which seems to a return (or atleast striving for) a big picture

Would anyone be interested in participating? Please let me know via PM or in the comments below! And please let me know if you have any further questions! :)

3) Despite not being able to see what people look like

4) In what ways does reddit point to the future of socializing/social ""formalities"" (or lack thereof)/information sharing (google as opposed to the library)?

5) Is the reddit phenomenon of ""non-experts"" acting as ""experts"" freeing us from the archaic, or is having infinite information at our fingertips making us lazy know-it-alls?

6) How is socializing online like meeting people inside-out? Based on what you've observed online, etc. than they appear to be in real life?

7) How are your online friendships the same/different than your RL friendships? Are there times when you feel closer to your online friends? Are there times when you feel like the people you associate with in RL don't know who you ""really"" are?

Marx: Public transport has definitely advanced. I could  see that the proletariat and the bourgeois are brushing shoulders. The tram has delivered affordable and efficient transport to those who previously could not afford it. Even the Lumpen-Proletariat receiving welfare can afford the luxury of the beach which in my time was only afforded to the bourgeois or those who lived close to the coast.

Durkheim: I agree that there are positive aspects of the Glenelg tram however

Me: What did you guys think of the stores at Glenelg that you saw while waiting for the tram?

Marx: I found them to be indicative of a problem that is masqueraded, decent clothing and a significant other. What they don't understand is that all of their goods come at the price of exploited individuals in other countries or maybe they do understand but do not care. Mechanical solidarity has been obliterated. The division of labour is now so intense that there is now a salesperson for everything. Instead of people producing and being a part of society and equally being supported by others businesses must use marketing to convince consumers to keep purchasing to keep the economy good for benefit of everyone. However nobody actually needs the majority of what they purchase to survive and the majority of all the profits only touch the pockets of few. 

Durkheim: Marx, they are enslaved by consumerism because they have the money to purchase the things that they want. However, this is purely psychological and not out of necessity. Nobody is forced to work and is so desperate that they cannot fulfill their dreams. Thousands of workers lives have been enriched by their employment by manufacturing the tram and running it day to day and many more peoples lives have been enriched by the tram running.

Me: So guys

Durkheim: Adelaide in the year 2012 is like one large organism. So many houses, everyone has a purpose. I can see now that there is no need to feel anomie. Those in these large houses have achieved it because they have been rewarded as a result of demonstrating great merit.

This criticism is primarily concerned with issues of race

A significant backlash to this trend on tumlbr has also formed, but I do feel as though the social criticism on Tumblr is often lacking in academic support and has the potential to be wildly inaccurate as somewhat pointed out by a user of the aforementioned subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/19h4uh/how_information_gets_around_on_tumblr/c8nzvsx

The social criticism also seem to skimp over the overarching effect of class on these socially excluded groups, and often these are the people who the 'SJW's (social justice warriors, to use one of their own abbreviations I believe) in fact target. They see this isolation and shaming as a solution to the issues without addressing some of the important underlying structures of society or getting involved in organisations/other activism.

I'm taking the course right now and, I like being exposed to academic content that I otherwise would not have gained access to. I've always wanted to learn more about sociology, and it's awesome to not have to pay to take a course where I can learn just as much, if not more, than I would have if I had taken it at my college.

It's proving itself to be an extremely good resource for those who want to dive into the field but need some structure and discussion/explication/analysis. It also seems to be an equally good resource for those who are already well-versed in the field and want access to academic readings, to be fair, I'm not really sure because some of this might be the ""typical"" introductory content, but still). 

I've tuned in to some courses online before, and I feel more ""accountable"" than if I had merely been watching taped lectures (which can be awesome in their own right).

Obviously, live weekly seminars (mostly with non-USA students who are taking the class) and, most importantly, readings. So yeah, pick and choose among the readings, or do the class if you're new to sociology and you've got the time. It's in its third week, and new material is added each week.

I miss the projects most.  Most of the soc classes I took had at least one or two open ended projects. I was ""that guy"" who tried to pick out the most outlandish topics he could find.  

I don't have time to do full stories right now

* I took soc 101 in my first semester of community college and the final project for the class was what hooked me into the major. We just had to pick a subculture (the prof said ""the stranger, mores, inner conflicts, how they stand out from society, etc.  On my friend's suggestion, I picked furries. I found out there was a furry convention coming to my town that semester and decided to go there and interview people.  I also hung out in furry IRC channels and chatted with people (not undercover.)  It was an odd experience to say the least.  There's a lot to say about this, but I don't have the time to write it out at the moment...but I will say the weirdest thing to happen to me at the convention had nothing to do with furries. 

* I transfered to UW-Madison eventually.  In my experimental sociology course, about 5 minutes after I got there, I realized that you can't just walk up to people in casinos and start talking to them while they're playing.  Let alone on a weekday night when the people aren't there for the social atmosphere.  Realizing I had picked the wrong topic for a proper ethnography, I decided to chance it and write about the atmosphere of the casino instead--the graphic designs on the machines, that C-major-pitched ambient sound that the slots make, and the lighting, among other things. While staying as objective as possible

* In my criminology course, there was so much to write about in that season in particular for a criminology paper.  If I remember correctly, it was a 10 pager, and it was one of the worst papers I had written in undergrad...it was pretty much impossible to satisfactorily sum up the criminological aspects of a season of that show in 10 pages.",,False,,True,t3_a5pyr

 An example of this is honesty. We all lie daily but hold honesty as a positive character trait possibly only in principle and not practice. When you fill out an application and complete the personality survey you are put in a position of lying to prove that you know what the morality of the invisible majority is or you can be honest but are portrayed as amoral. This is only one example but there are many examples in which lying is justified such as lying by omission or ""white lies"" or to be kind.

Another example is integrity; we act different ways around different people beacuse of social pressures and expectations. The general response i have gotten to this question is that it is so we can get along with other people. i understand that we cant curse out everyone just beacuse we dont like the way they look or something. however it seems counterproductive to avoid conflict beacuse without difference of opinion we cannot improve our viewpoints and will continue to be misinformed and carry illogical points of view on forever.

i am aware that this answer may involve some history as well. it seems like there had to be a point in time where ""right and wrong"" were given to us by possibly a king or group of people to have this constant divergence over generations between this sort of morality of the invisible majority to what we as people do naturally.",,t5_2qhbo,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/1ekant/why_are_cultural_expectations_not_aligned_with/

Weber describes the spirit of capitalism very similarly to the focus on industry: ""The peculiarity of this philosophy of avarice appears to be the ideal of the honest man of recognized credit

It is curious that Durkheim states that religion ""has lost most of its power, to the Church. . . . [The meaning of their activity is] that business with its continuous work has become a necessary part of their lives. That is in fact the only possible motivation, but it at the same time expresses what is, seen from the view-point of personal happiness, so irrational about this sort of life, where a man exists for the sake of his business, instead of the reverse.""

Obviously it isn't terribly difficult to discern the viewpoints these two describe, but so far Weber hasn't explicitly touched on the role of government, though he seems to have hinted at it. On the one hand, Weber seems to offer a clearer description of the spirit itself and the history/structure surrounding it, while Durkheim's writing makes intriguing implications for the psychology of anomy and alienation vs. integration in capitalism as described by Weber.

[Presentation of Self in Everyday Life](http://www.clockwatching.net/~jimmy/eng101/articles/goffman_intro.pdf) by Erving Goffman. Important to provide a well-rounded view of sociology. He focused on behavioral interactions.


[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society](http://www.amazon.com/The-Structural-Transformation-Public-Sphere/dp/0262581086) by Jurgen Habermas. This is an Amazon link. According to Brickus he is important for his work on rationality and the public sphere. This is necessary for understanding the democratic societies.


[Jurgen Habermas](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/habermas/) from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. A big long article explaining Habermas and his work. May be good for those who can’t buy the book.


[Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison](http://www.amazon.com/Discipline-Punish-The-Birth-Prison/dp/0679752552) by Michel Foucault. Amazon link. Details the evolution of punishment from the 1700s to today. 

[Discipline and Punish](http://books.google.com/books?id=AVzuf-r22eoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) by Michel Foucault on Google Books. Most of his book is available online

[Discipline and Punish](http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/disciplinepunish/) by Foucault

[The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge](http://www.amazon.com/The-Social-Construction-Reality-Sociology/dp/0385058985) by Peter. L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann. Amazon link. Govty says it’s a must. I read through the small portion I could find online [here](http://evans-experientialism.freewebspace.com/berger_luckmann.htm) and it did seem very interesting.

[Foundations of Sociology](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Foundations-Sociology-Towards-Better-Understanding/dp/0333960505) by Richard Jenkins. Govty says this is a good introductory text. I’ve never read it

Resources: 

[Introduction to Sociology](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Sociology) from Wikibooks. Good for those who really need a crash course in sociology.

[Transformations of the Public Sphere](http://publicsphere.ssrc.org/) from Public Sphere. A long list of articles related to the public sphere and how it is conceptualized. Looks like a very good resource for those sociologists interested in the public sphere. 

[The Society Pages](http://thesocietypages.org/) is very current resource for sociologists.

[Sociological Images](http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/) from the Society Pages is a good resource for teachers and professors. Presents sociology very visually.

[Sociology for Nerds](http://www.sociologyfornerds.com/) suggested by chekawa. Pretty must as the title says. In addition

[Contexts](http://contexts.org/) from the American Sociological Association. Quarterly magazine that “makes sociology interesting and relevant to anyone interested in how society operates” according to their website. Chekawa recommends it. 

[Thinking Allowed](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/ta) a podcast by Laurie Taylor.

Plus the other stuff I had listed above. Marx is important because he began one of the three main fields of sociology. Engels is important because of his work on gender and sexuality. I found his work to be extremely enlightening when understanding the historical roots for how our views on gender came to be. Mills coined the term ""sociological imagination"" and provided us with our basis for learning about how we as individuals fit into history and society. In addition, how gender is perceived today.

1352167637.0,12pdb2,My sociological analysis of Walter White (Breaking Bad),lgros003,32,14,8,"Okay.  So

I’m going to make a point to keep it to the sociological view of thought, at least in my admittedly limited experience.  I’m also going to assume that those reading this have at least a limited knowledge of the character of Walter White.

**THERE MAY OR MAY NOT BE SPOILERS

**Durkheim**

It is debatable as to whether Walter White honestly believes that his actions are truly evil.  On the one hand, Jr.  This is because of his initial belief that his reason for doing what he has done is the only thing he could do in his situation. 
Walter reaffirms the idea that crime is a product of norms.  At the very beginning of the show, and his goal is solely to provide his family the money needed for their survival.  The only thing he has done ‘wrong’ at this point was to pursue a profession deemed criminal by much of society.  Why is it criminal, however?  Originally, it was because of the government’s decision that methamphetamine should be consumed, bought, or sold.  While most people do agree with this viewpoint in modern society, meth was perfectly legal and thought of as a treatment for obesity, narcolepsy and alcoholism.  It was not until 1986 that methamphetamine was made illegal.  This means that in the dichotomy between mala in se (wrong or evil by itself) and mala prohibita (wrong because prohibited), he must resort to violence and murder.  His actions at this point become mala in se.

**Merton**

Merton’s principal belief was that crime was normal, the entire concept would have been completely invalid had the show occurred somewhere with unlimited nationalized healthcare.  Walt would have had no need to initially deviate.
However, it is assumed, is that he could apply his knowledge for a monetary payoff.  However, as we learn later on, Walter decided against continuing with Grey Matter, in favor of a life with Skyler.  This resulted in his becoming a high school chemistry teacher.  In my own personal opinion, this is an example of a life which is characterized either by ritualism or by rebellion.  Most teachers do not become teachers for the money, as Walter continued as a teacher, he had to innovate.  He could no longer afford the lifestyle he had unless he did so.  He found a lifestyle which was lucrative and which would provide him with the money he needed.  Innovation really worked for Walt in terms of the goals/means typology

**Agnew (Strain Theory)**

Walter White experienced every type of strain proposed by Agnew.  Walt certainly did not achieve the goals he set for himself in the past, by way of constant fear, anger, envy and jealousy over Gray Matter, depression and frustration over his personal life and who he was personally, the realization that he would have to face up to what he had done after he was cured of cancer, and a myriad of other things.  It’s hard to enumerate the number of strain factors here

Rewriting is very important for ""good"" papers and is a common practice for both students and teachers. This involves stripping text of fancy

Characteristic faults of sociological writing:   
1. passive constructions   
2. abstract nouns   
3. unwillingness (inability) to make causal statements   

Sociological writers do not develop a culture

When writing, etc.) read your works in progress.

Academic writers adopt (sometimes) elitist styles of writing not functionally
   
Use of academic style might reflect writers' insecurities

Undergraduate students are usually more concerned (as a result of the structure of the grading system) with writing as a means to earn a grade

Writing and teaching is “decoupled”

There is no One Right Way   

Don’t begin papers with evasive maneuvers.  Especially at the beginning.   

It’s important to write drafts

You don’t have to solve all the problems you find in your topic—instead you can write about why they are problems and how you’ve thought about them.   

Rules pertaining to writing are not automatic. There are matters of creativity and taste.   

Content is more important than style   

Writing should be succinct

Active is preferred to passive verbs   

Reduce repetition. Usually on serves to obscure points.   

Use concrete words and sentences when possible.   

Use caution with metaphors   


students guard their egos against peers and other scholars by attaching their work to a reputable research tradition

the “classics” of sociology have important functions

there is an ongoing relationship with contemporary scholars and their predecessors – “normal science” – you are only a small part of a very large scientific community

effectively using literature involves piecing together arguments and insights from others and filling in gaps with your own scholarship

paying too much attention to literature can also deform your argument

tips will do nothing unless you make them habits -- practice

For the past few months

 

During the federal budget negotiations in March, but rather to eliminate funding for political science research.  While this amendment was not adopted, a second amendment offered by Senator Coburn was adopted.  This required the Director of NSF to certify each political science grant with a justification of how it ""promotes national security or the economic interests of the United States"".  This is now a requirement at NSF and will continue to be so as long as the federal government is funded by a continuing resolution containing this provision.  Needless to say such a requirement will have a chilling effect on NSF funding and is a clear intrusion by Congress into the widely respected peer review process at NSF.

 

Congress is now considering budgets for next year.  In these discussions, other agencies may face similar challenges.  As a result all of the major social science organizations and the organizations representing universities and science more generally have begun to urge the Congress to reject these attacks on social sciences.  We urge you to join these efforts. Specifically, we urge you to write your Senator and Congressperson to express concern about the adoption of the Coburn amendment and to urge Congress to stop the efforts to undermine the NSF and to reduce support for the social sciences.  If you want to help we suggest you send a version of the following letter to your members of Congress:

 

Hello

As a scientist at the University of ___________, other research agencies.

 

Thank for considering our concerns.

I want to explore drug prohibition a bit, most of the argument against hallucinogenics is based on irrational media hyped nonsense. My experimentation with hallucinogenics didn't harm anyone, but led to a personal growth and awareness through my experience. I was able to educate myself enough to decide not to mess with drugs that would be harmful to me, though my choices had nothing to do with caring that many people label all drug use as being deviant. If anything, I had moments of clarity in my life to the things I was unaware of as being harmful and have made positive changes for myself. 

Overall I want to examine social control and conformity, does anyone have any suggestions for topics to explore?

1. what careers are the most abundant in social science and which are the most sought after? I've been interested in a bunch of different areas from social policy to consulting and honestly it's better for me to have something in mind when choosing a degree rather than to have nothing.

The debate over same-sex marriage in the US is at fever pitch right now.  Honestly, with just a bit of history thrown in and a few studies about child-rearing.

What seems far more interesting would be to look at the issue from a sociological perspective.  It seems to me that this is basically a fight over inclusion/exclusion from a social institution, for instance.

On the other side of the issue, and other signals of social inclusion.

If we look at the problem this way, where there was no disguising, say, your race or gender: a black woman in the antebellum South had zero chance of being accepted as an equal into a group of white male friends.  An LGBT person, on the other hand, may be accepted into a group prior to coming out--forming a common identity with the group that will make the group more likely to accept them when they come out.  (This of course relies on the current self-reinforcing cycle of greater acceptance leading to more people coming out leading to greater acceptance.)

* A dominant interpretation has emerged in english sociology of education for cultural capital the hinges on two assumptions/premises: A.) cultural capital is assumed to denote knowledge of or competence with ""highbrow"" aesthetic culture (such as fine arts). B.) researchers have assumed that the effect of cultural capital is separate from educational skills

* The ""highbrow"" interpretation is not essential to Bourdieus conceptualization of cultural capital. Also find little in Bourdieu's work to suggest that skill or ability needs to be partitioned from cultural capital.  (Pg. 568-69)

Authors: F. Carson Mencken
   
*Abstract*   
      
In this paper we examine the relationship between conventional Christian and paranormal beliefs.
Conventional Christian beliefs are those such as belief in Heaven
Paranormal beliefs include belief in UFOs, communication with the dead, and
Bigfoot. We test three hypotheses (deviance) (marginalization
the relationship between these two belief types with factor analysis and regression analysis. The
data we use are from the Baylor Religion Survey
Gallup Organization in fall 2005. The factor analysis results show that there are two well-defined
spheres of supernatural beliefs
positive relationship between these two belief clusters. However
shows that church attendance and religious tradition moderate the effects of conventional
Christian beliefs on paranormal beliefs. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for
theory and research.",,t5_2qhbo,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/13i9tp/round_trip_to_hell_in_a_flying_saucer_the/

Katniss is obviously a female, but she does “shatter stereotypes” mostly because she sometimes takes on the role of aggressors, and is the dominant in the majority of her relationships (see Peeta, Gale, her family, basically any interaction for reference).

In most modern circumstances, these acts of violence are fast and left un-elaborated. They are used for entertainment value, and because of the large quantity, more and more gore is needed for shock.

In the context of juvenile delinquency, all youth *should* be able to have the same opportunities as others, regardless of the families they were born into. This doesn't mean that all youth should have the same lives, but rather that they are equally competitive for the means. So our focus in helping underserved youth should be in preparing them to be competitive, not giving them. So for example in the case of the job market.

I just started it and it looks like a good read

**Defining a network society**
&gt;A network society is a society whose social structure is made of networks powered by microelectronics-based information and communication technologies. By social structure, reproduction, experience, and power expressed in meaningful communication coded by culture. A network is a set of interconnected nodes. A node is the point where the curve intersects itself. A network has no center, just nodes.

**Why network society instead of information society**

&gt;The reason, as far as we can trust the historical record, all known societies are based on information and knowledge as the source of power, wealth, and meaning (Mokyr, 1990; Mazlish, 1993).

[...]

&gt;So, is a society built around microelectronics-based information technologies.

**Globalization and network society**

&gt;Thus, for the time being, most are not. But everybody is affected by the processes that take place in the global networks of this dominant social structure. This is because the core activities that shape and control human life in every corner of the planet are organized in these global networks: financial markets; transnational production, management, and the distribution of goods and services; highly skilled labor; science and technology; communication media, culture, art, global civil society (Castells, 1999; Stiglitz,False

I've basically been ostracized by nearly all professors at my current school (and many others) for focusing on the field.  Anyone else run into a similar problem with their specialization?

I understand that the current generation of successful sociologists aren't really in tune with the Internet and its possibilities. Many professors that I've talked to are technophobes (don't even own a computer outside of their office). 

I'm going to give you a quick overview of my opinion:

Despite what many modern sociologists believe about the limitations of communication through the virtual space (Putnam, I believe that people have been far too quick to judge a medium that's essentially in its infancy (comparatively to other mass mediums of communication).  While things may not be as ""revolutionary"" as the prognostications of Wired Magazine in the 1990s, I believe that the technology used to access the Internet, and not the Internet itself, is the only real limitation to realizing its full potential as a social landscape.

A friend of mine uses the term 'survival of the fittest' when arguing in favour of free market capitalism (or at least why it's control is impossible), from what I think is called a Darwinistic perspective.

""In order to avoid the bullshit, who suggests that the social behaviour of non-human species can be used to simplify the complicated decisions (sometimes deliberately obfuscating - hence ""avoid the bullshit"") made by businessman, and the reactions of consumers. My friend also uses natural selection to suggest that that the inequality that seems to be a common component of capitalist societies is an unfortunate, but inevitable product (For a cat to survive, a mouse must die).

Me? I'm not exactly sure about describing the free market in terms of natural selection. For starters, but I've not found any explanation beyond this title, and I've yet to consider whether or not culture is again a product of natural selection, rather than separate from it. Is anything separate from it?

I don't agree with the attitude ""It's in our nature, this responsibility my presumption, and to considering what it's origins might be I find extremely taxing.

So far I've read a few different Wikipedia pages including those on The Naturalistic Fallacy, Evolutionary Psychology, and a bunch of other pages to which these refer. I've been able to find a reasonable amount of academic information on why free market capitalism isn't a literal example of natural selection; though little to suggest that it's not a fitting metaphor.

There is a tragic authoritarianism here. The South like Japan is hierarchical and emphasizes politeness and avoiding direct confrontation with authorities esp. But children are not protected from it here. They are often taught that they have original sin and punished in ways that would shock the Japanese. Here is a related comment I found: ""...""poisonous pedagogy"" that views child-rearing as a contest of wills

Now there will always be contests of wills with kids

I suspect this belief is why so many of the students in my classes suggest that we can ""fix"" the school system by reintroducing spanking and the Bible in our Elem. schools.

I think this kind of upbringing also explains why so many of my peers are so very reluctant to question, is quite shocking and abhorrent to many people.

It just seems as if the adults are more childish than the children. And so i find myself wishing to avoid most people as much as possible.
