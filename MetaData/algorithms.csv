So, and how to get it(in O(n^2)). As far as I can tell, the fft works because there are repeating expressions in the roots of unity for even and odd roots of unity, however when I write them out I fail to see any repeating patters. My book says that a given root of unity is: e^((2*pi*i*k) / n) for k = 0 to n-1. However on the web I've seen all these examples where they neglect the k, which makes no sense to me. My book is the third edition of introduction to algorithms in case anybody is wondering.



I sort of understand what a recursive fft does. Recursively breaks the vector into even and odd indexed coefficients(so two vectors total, until the vector lengths are 1, in which it retuns that value. I don't understand why this works, reminds me a lot of merge sort, but I can't grasp why breaking it into evens and odds works here. I don't understand the rebuild step whatsoever, where it loops from 0 up through n/2 - 1, I'm definitely going to need somebody to explain that part.



So, I can't stand these terse explanations on the web. The reason I want to understand it is because I need to write a recursive FFT algorithm that works for polynomials bounded by an n that is a base 3 number, rather than the traditional base 2 solution.

1) A seller (you) is given a list of n buyers. 

2) There is only one of each bottle of wine. So m total &amp; distinct bottles altogether.

3) Each buyer has 10 wines he/she desires (there might be the same wines in different lists). 

5) You can only sell to each buyer once.

6) You have the options of picking which bottles of wine a buyer receives. So he/she may receive 3 (minimal) through 10 bottles

7) Some customers might be left empty-handed if the remaining inventory does not satisfy their list (i.e a minimal of three bottles to an order).

Objective: Your goal is to maximize the number of wine sold, and since I have not formally studied this area, I'm stumped on a good solution. Any suggestions on an algorithm to use?

EDIT: 

Also consider run-time of the problem.

Example:

  m=14

  Buyer 2 wants: [3,6,7,8,9,10,11

  Buyer 3 wants: [3,6,7,8,9,10,13

I've thought of a different way of doing this that I think might be more efficient

Now my second implementation requires the use of the same bool array representing the state of the cells, similar to my previous solution, but they would be used to increment the ints in the second array which keeps track of the neighbor count. If the current index in the bool array is false, then it is ignored and no neighbors need to be calculated.

1. Are there any overlaps?
2. Do the intervals fill the whole space? (= are there any gaps?)

Since these intervals can be multidimensional
    
    N = 1     x=[0
    N = 2     x=(0, ∞)
    ...

The whole thing easiest to explain with N = 1

    x=(-∞
    x=[0

In this case there are no gaps or overlap

This one has a gap at x=0:

    x=(-∞
    x=(0

This one overlaps at x=0.

    x=(-∞

My intuition tells me that the algorithm should somehow ""merge"" intervals and if there are no gaps

    x=(-∞
    x=[0
    x=[100

could be merged in a pair-wise manner to x=(-∞

Scenario: Let's say I offer some kind of product for sale. I have competitors, 500 packs, etc.).

There are several rules that apply for the calculation though: I do not necessarily want to be the cheapest seller everytime

* if 1 or more of the competitors are **too** cheap

* if I'm the cheapest among all of them

* if there are 6 sellers for 1 product, I only want to beat the other 4 so that I can become 2nd cheapest without going down with the price too much. It's like a ""how much positions can I go up and how much does that cost me?""-calculation. I need an algorithm that calculates the best position for the best price.

I have a set of things, m. m is typically a lot smaller than n [like, 1/10th]. FWIW, this is Java. [for interest, m is actually the sum of the weights]

*Solution 1:*
[This is the ""obvious

Put everything into a list. I used an ArrayList. Run across the list and sum the weights into a ""totalVal"". Roll the dice to pick a number in the range 0..totalVal. Run across the set with an accumulator [O(n)] and remove the one that falls on the number [O(n)]. Total time

*Solution 2:*
[This is a performance improvement

Do the same thing as before

*Solution 3:*

This one is probabilistic in performance, I store an accumulator on the set items themselves. Now it's easy to do a O(log(n)) algorithm to find the thing I'm looking for each time I roll a dice. Obviously naive removal is going to be O(n) as I have to iterate across the entire list to fix the iterator. O(m*n*log(n)), not as good as the one before.

So, then I reject the roll and try again.

Solution 3 is faster in practice by wallclock, that's gonna be obviously some awful performance. If m is 1, it'll be zippyfast.

After some initial experiments in Python I moved to C for control and speed and created [this project](https://github.com/rheyns/pollock-conjecture-stats) which can calculate coverage for the first billion integers in 5 minutes on a Core 2-based laptop. (About 30000x faster than on Skienna's machine.)

After reviewing the literature I found a [paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.140.7839&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf) that claims to be able to check n integers in O(n) time. Currently my algorithm has the same complexity as Skienna's* namely O(n^(4/3)). In particular they claim to generate the 3-numbers - integers generated by the sum of three pyramidal numbers - in ""large constant"" time but I can't seem to find a description of how they do it.

and index j where i &lt; j &lt;=n-1
We call this out ""range uniqueness query.""  It returns a boolean whether or not the set holds unique values.

Beginner’s approach: we can see a very easy to implement algorithm that requires no preprocessing simply checks each element in A[i … j].  This requires |A[i … j]|2 comparisons.  This is also very bad.   Conclusion: Θ(n) space

Beginner’s approach 2: we can see multiple redundant comparisons are made when checling the array A[i … j].  First off
Θ(n) space

We want to reduce the number of comparisons by constructing a datastructure to compute some of it beforehand.  Then
A)	The space of the resultant data structure
B)	The run-time of the RUQ

We can take as long as we want to construct the data structure

We could compute all values of all ranges before hand in a lookup table

Our prof gave us a hint saying it could be done looking at range minimum queries.

1) Am I doing it right? Is this the correct way to solve problems like these? i.e.

2) I feel like I've abstracted the problem to something that would already have a standard algorithm for:

Two important notes.  First, a vertex may be repeated in the chosen sequence.  (In the application I have in mind, not only are vertices repeated, they are often repeated.)

I am developing a search engine for an upcoming web venture

This search engine will return a list of user profiles. Each profile is assigned a score based off how much content they have added - 50 points for profile pictures, and 2 pts for low. Each profile also has a 0-5 star rating, and an integer value which represents the amount of times that the profile's owner has made a sprocket.
The problem is that I need an algorithm which orders by profiles with high ratings and content scores but low sprocket counts.
From my limited mathematical knowledge

    priority = (sprockets / total sprockets) + (rating / 5) + (score / max score)

**edit 2**: Here's the one response I got on r/math from **jeffrey_negrea**

    base = (rating / 5) + (score / max score)  
    spro = (sprockets / total sprockets)
  
&gt; If you want priority to decrease when sprockets increase

    priority = base / [1 + i/k]k = [(rating / 5) + (score / max score)] / [1 + (sprockets / total sprockets)(e/k)]k

&gt; The highest score possible is 2 occurring iff rating=5
The lowest score possible is 0 occurring iff rating = score = 0.  As the number of compounding intervals per unit time goes to infinity

    priority = (base)exp{-i} = base / [1 + i / k] k = [(rating / 5) + (score / max score)] exp{-(sprockets / total sprockets) e}

So here's the problem.

I'm not sure how familiar many of you are with fantasy football, 12, or 14 people total) take turns choosing real-life players to be on your imaginary team, filling spots on your roster based on football position. Once a player is chosen, he's taken, and can't be selected by anyone else.

What I'm looking to do is to create a program or algorithm that will select the best team possible given the number of players that should be selected at each position. I've already broken the players into rounds

Say my draft is much smaller. There are only 4 people playing in the league, one quarterback (QB), and two wide receivers (WR). The rounds look as follows.

**Round 1**

QB A (87 points)
QB B (80 points)
RB A (79 points)
WR A (75 points)

**Round 2**

RB B (70 points)
WR B (68 points)
WR C (67 points)
RB C (65 points)

**Round 3**

QB C (62 points)
RB D (60 points)
WR D (58 points)
QB D (56 points)

**Round 4**

QB E (55 points)
WR E (53 points)
WR F (52 points)
QB F (51 points)

**Round 5**

RB E (49 points)
WR G (46 points)
WR H (45 points)
QB G (42 points)

Being able to pick one player from each round, and 2 WR's. While this is fairly simple reduced down to this size, it's much more complicated (with there being literally millions of possible paths) when you have a group of 14 people selecting for 15 rounds.

This matrix will have values 0 through Z on both axes

The method I am using to model these probabilities is as follows: For each possible combination of A black-dice successes and B white-dice successes (with proposed values A and B ranging from 0 to the sample size Z)

* the probability of rolling A black-dice successes (0.5 ^ A)

* the probability of rolling black-dice failures on the remaining black dice (0.5 ^ (Z - (A+Q)))

* the probability of rolling B white-dice successes (0.333 ^ B)

* the probability of rolling white-dice failures on the remaining white dice (0.667 ^ (Z - (B+P)))

I then use the hypergeometric distribution for a population size X+Y with X possible successes and a sample size of Z to determine the probability that exactly P black dice would be drawn in the first place and multiply the above product by that number. This gives me the probability that I will draw exactly P black dice and Q white dice when drawing Z dice from a bag of X black dice and Y white dice

I have written a Java program to run these numbers for me because ain't nobody trying to do all that on paper

Therefore
